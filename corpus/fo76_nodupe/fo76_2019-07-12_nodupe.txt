I prefer the dcg. It seems a little more responsive than the powerfist for some reason. Probably my imagination. Sucks the new gauntlet is actually less damage than those two.

---
If they get rewarded, than they did enough damage to have contributed to the event (1000+). Therefore they qualify for the reward. Who cares where they sit.
---
Idk why someone would want to but anything nice you get in the next week might be duped. I dont think bethesda cares or tries to ban people anymore so your fine, but its probably duped
---
Nice grammar, also they did contribute in some way, albeit a very minor contribution, but it still counts.
---

---
(I had to look it up lmao)
---
Ew. If you had points to spare you could try the perk where it lets you hack robots.
---
This is really annoying. I remember having to press around 5-6 times (not even spamming quickly) and it still wouldn't work. Perhaps it's like this so having a weapon/perk with the ability to auto-heal gets used more?
---
Yes! üòÇ The first time I rescued someone there was no dialogue. I thought that was weird. Then saw it was always like that. Just a simple thanks would suffice.
---
*laughs in god mode*     (no i have not and do not plan on using god mode)
---
If she doesn‚Äôt land because of them having the camp set up there and it being so high in the air it‚Äôs a problem for the level 50 to 100 that are trying to get the damage in cause most don‚Äôt have weapons with such range to hit her in the air. NEXT.
---
[deleted]
---
That does bother me too :( 1650 and I can have a brighter light.
---
Yeah. I start to shake a bit.  
---
It's anxiety brought on by my own lack of confidence in the weapons I'm forced to use, my skills with regards to this particular style of shooter, and the "knowledge" that if they actually get to shoot me then I'm dead, that in turn brought about by a function of the frequent and numerous cheaters in the mode.  
---
This anxiety isn't present in the likes of Doom's Battlemode or Quake Champions; there it's more of a thrill, an actual satisfaction in the back and forth.  
---
It's by and large why I don't like PvP in any game not explicitly built for it: cheating and exploits become too problematic for me to actually have fun.  
---
Honestly, it's why I take to hiding in the lake or bushes: turns the mode in "hide-and-seek" which is far more enjoyable.
---
I tend to check those for loot when traveling in a team. Killed a guy just chillin in there once, I had no idea people were peaceful in NW. Everytime I just try and sneak by I get hunted, granted I usually look terrifying.
---
Talking shit about OP to the OP lmao what a power move
---
You act like that's a valid excuse
---
Duhn-da-da-duhn-da-da-duhn-duhn-duhn
---
Ha, that Zora is the least of the worries.
---
It's for those players starting a little late or those not grinding the 10k xp for 100 score. Those issues along with each spot increasing the score needed to advance made it impossible for Bethesda to say "its free". Meaning if you joined today you would almost have to shell out cash to get all 100.
---
They need to let the boards stay active into the following seasons.  Not permanently but for a few additional weeks. This would take the grind out of the game which after just two weeks has everyone passed. Can you imagine this sub halfway through next season at this pace? No one will be playing.
---
You can't breathe underwater forever can you? I never tried this in NW lol.
---
And that's the crux of the problem. No good places to farm. So people do unintended ways to farm events/quests, breaking it for those just trying to complete. Then they get mad and new people dont even know whats going on. It's a cluster right now
---
I'd considered something like that, but it's nicer to think they were being helpful.
---
Don't you have to be in your own base and be able to use the display case to exploit the duplication glitch though? Didn't think you could do it in other people's bases.
---
Have you seen the campa that encourage her to land yet? Those are helpful. Create a raised platform 2-3 stairs high and as big as you can and she will land on it like a helipad lol.
---
If you struggle getting in damage, grab a mini gun and 1500 rounds of 5mm. Even non legendary. It will do 1 dmg per hit at a super fast rate. It will get you credit untill ya get better stuff for your build.
---
Ay, i appreciate all of this, I think I‚Äôm going to be making a stealth/vats ( I might change it but idk if it will be a switch to melee I think I‚Äôll stick to firearms) build and I‚Äôll definitely take all of this into consideration!
---
Ty
---
I usually don't kill people unless I'm in a team. Which is rare. 
---
I ran past someone who didn't kill me once lol we clearly saw eachother
---
Anyone got a list for must have perk cards for a bloodied build? I‚Äôve rolled some okay unyielding SS armor and have thought about going the bloodied route. Would probably do commando.
---
I think other NW challenges counting for it is just a mistake since it does specify dailies on the weekly.
---
If you mean doing the event to launch a nuke in a team yes. It works just like a private team
---
I gota 2* junkies flamer with bashing with your name on it.
---
Ur low lvl now, youll come upon more so learn it :)
---
It's a lot easier now for you new guys.  Most of the NW regulars don't seem to play as much anymore and I think most of the hackers moved to Warzone as well, so you're more likely to get a "fair" match vs. being pitted against the OG folks.  I joined a game to try to do the new daily because I had no idea how much XP I needed for another level.  Ended up killing 17 people and winning match, still saw I had another half a level to go, and decided to skip this challenge lol
---
I have the best items for my build and do way more damage than needed to her. I‚Äôm talking about other players that don‚Äôt have all of that stuff. Yes while the ones that help her land are good the ones that are literally just there to camp at the top of it‚Äôs difficult to have her land due to that.
---
I forget the name of it, it's the one where you have to defend the set of the flare, and defend the drop point and the vertibots comes and drops the crate.
---
Lower levels can't do anything anyway. They never hit the damage requirement then come bitching on here about the event being bugged. Totally agree that floating roof campers are dicks though.
---
I‚Äôve had it set off my sciatic nerve a couple of times. I tense up a lot playing these types of games. Friday the 13th the game was really hard for me to play. Sucks because I really enjoy the survival aspect but my body just reacts terribly to it.
---
*Level while wearing a full clown outfit, being over level 76 and holding an axe. 
---
Newbois will never know.
---
Could you not get it to work?
---
Darn. And to think we were so close.
---
Oooh lol that would make sense lol
---
FINALLY, some attention to spices!!! I have waited so long for this.
---
I need a giant stockpile of them to keep making my cannibal themed food, but I always run out of them before I even run out of intestines.
---
No I said why I‚Äôm asking I haven‚Äôt been on for the past 2 days because of some personal issues
---
God damn just take some deep breaths kid.
---
Same, it was kind of annoying, because I have 15 luck (with no buffs) so every weapon/armor I find is about 20% condition above max.
---
I switched to a mule and crafted 10x boards and spent about 20 minutes whacking ghouls until their condition went down.
---
It does feel like a lot. But I look at it like you need 10 lvls a week, last week I got 13 and this week I'm at 10 right now. The extra score will be nice cause if you've been doing it since beginning you kinda get a relief.
---
Well it mean it is free of course if you joined late you won't get everything free. What they should do is have it so like the last day or week you can have so many "select a prize" buy option for like 500 atoms, or have it based off the reward type common,rare,legendary and obviously make the jangles backpack and power armor and the good stuff like 1000 atoms or something.  I'd be alright spending more to chose a specific reward.
---
If you need some weapons and armor I can craft you some!
---
People sharing that perk that boosts dr based on teams are why I don‚Äôt team with my berserker
---
Thanks, that was easier than I expected.
---
Same here man.
---
Vader got all 4 codes and a briefcase and now he means business
---
No. 4K at most, depending on the last perk
---
Also don't be in nuclear winter as the last thing you played before the refresh. I've noticed that if nuclear winter is the last or first thing im in then it can auto complete challenges.
---
Good to know i'm not the only one.
---
" like I said, if the lower levels can‚Äôt get shots in on her because she won‚Äôt land due to their camp it‚Äôs a problem. "
---
The lower level players won't be dealing any significant damage anyway, so they would technically be freeloaders. If the higher level players are sitting atop their camps and pumping lead into the Scorchbeast Queen, they deserve the loot because they worked for it, while the low-level players do not because they aren't dealing significant damage. It sounds like you're a low-level moocher who wants to deal as little damage as possible and still be rewarded for it.
---
I only use heavy weapons. By your logic the unarmed explosive fist perk is useless. But its only useless to me, not to people running an unarmed build. So yeah maybe a jetpack perk to you is useless, but that doesn't make it useless completely just cause it doesn't fit your build. If game designers followed your idea then fallout would have 1 gun and 1 piece or armor because having others would be 'useless'
---
I can‚Äôt explain why. But I started singing ‚ÄúThere is a skel-e-ton in my butt, there is a skeleton in my butt‚Äù to it. I can‚Äôt unhear it and have caught myself singing it around the house. Sorry and welcome to my nightmare.
---
And I also really don't understand what zora even is for? It would make sense if it was like "beat zora to claim jangles bundle" but it just says race zora to the finish?
---
Instead of having to copy this file every time, simply open cmd prompt as admin and run this:   
---
mklink "c:\\Users\\**MyUser**\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76"\\Project76.ini "**F**:\\Program Files\\ModifiableWindowsApps\\Fallout 76\\Project76.ini"  
---
Replace F:\\ with the correct drive letter for your Install Path and MyUser with your Windows username.
---
Why?
---
I never realized that. TIME TO RIP AND TEAR BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH
---
Both plan and bloodied bear arm is been dooped to hell at least on PS4 lol
---
Yeah.... i thought so. I asked if she could do 6k. LITERALLY ALL MY CAPS. And she just ignored me but it‚Äôs whatever. Not like my dream gun or anything üò≠
---
You could always try playing a different game
---
I'm jealous! I wanna hold hands toooo!!üò≠üòç
---
Sound like you just thought up an awesome legendary perk. Reduce weight for all equipped armor/weapons by 20% 40% 60% 80% respective to the levels. Tweak as needed of course.
---
Sweet thanks dawg
---
Extra daily shifts the chart. Chart also doesnt include participation in 2x.
---
I've been trying to sell a Anti-Armor explosive 10mm smg for 6k caps and nobody wants it lol. It's not THAT bad!
---
Edit: Anti-Armor, not bloodied. Doh!
---
NW triggers my anxiety attacks. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt play it anymore. I keep running out of Xanax
---
Even 6k is a ripoff for that.
---
isnt junkies builds close to it?
---
I don‚Äôt know what some of the players thinking is, it‚Äôs intriguing to say at least. when I just played there was this player (partial gt ‚Äòblaaackboi_‚Äô and some numbers) set up his camp on the ground, player went in to use the stash to get weapon and ammo, he saw it and immediately jumped on the top to move the tent up. After a few moves he stopped probably thought it was beyond everyone‚Äôs reach, a player with jetpack still got in and used the stash, this boi then kept moving the tent upwards to prevent others from using it. Eventually it was too high for everyone else but himself, he just hid there and pewpew the queen from time to time. This all happened in the middle of the battle. I mean what‚Äôs all this bs all about? It‚Äôs not like others can cause any wear and tear of his property lol
---
On what system?
---
Then how would you know how many people are duping, and that there are less now? ü§îü§îü§î
---
That's what I do, run a bunch of boxes to get a pile of stims, then wait for the fire to catch up. A guy started firing at me and I managed to run away fast enough while using the first 4. Goat legs helps because most people won't jump off the cliff after me.
---
What they said. Use this for rough prices on things.  [https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
You know the person doesn't get credit for the kill when you do this. Not to mention you don't drop a bag
---
Was that where the patriot gauss rifle was going to be?  I'd love to get my hands on that.
---
I would love this so much!
---
Yeah I've played NW since it got out. These days i didn't find a single hacker.  
---
And yeah, the XP necessary for leveling up is quite ridiculous. I just watched the Vault 51 lore on youtube from a guy that unlocked it all. Unless you can consistently win (usually that meant being a hacker) it just takes too long.  
---
As of 11-Jul-2020:   
---
\- Killing players: 20xp  
---
\- Sitting in a bush for 2 min: 30xp  
---
People can literally get more XP from clicking NW in the menu and going AFK than from actually playing it and surviving an encounter with another team.
---
That I understand like with the stash boxes in the survival tents but the actual huge camp that is literally useless for people camping it‚Äôs a big issue.
---
You On Xbox?
---
Last time I had joined a public team and noticed they were in a nuke silo. Went to that silo to help out and they were just on the other side of the first set of laser grids. I tried to walk to them but the game wanted me to go and fabricate an ID and pretty much start the quest from the beginning instead of joining their progress. That‚Äôs kind of what I meant. Sharing progress on the nuke run instead of having everyone do it
---
Hey, thanks!
---
YES sometimes i also shake!
---
Yes but in a terminal I found it‚Äôs referred as the presidential gauss rifle . I used the pa glitch to get in here
---
I‚Äôm pretty new can someone explain generally what‚Äôs going on
---
There was meant to be an event where you would race around the map rigging polling stations to become the President and if you won you got a seal to redeem for a special Power Armor/Armor/Gauss Rifle. Hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet though so rn it‚Äôs not used
---
It's called a joke, and I'm sorry that went over your head.
---
Such sensitive people.....
---
Oh! Sorry that I gave the wrong Info.
---
Because I jsut got on and on other trading groups there are less people trading rare items how else numb nuts
---
Yeah
---
I run a vampire switchblade most places.
---
FSS Ghoul slayers switchbladewhen I‚Äôm in WS.
---
Yeah, it also makes me very anxious to the point i avoid playing it. I wonder why we can't take it lightly.
---
If you're on PC press Alt and F4 while stood on top of a stash box
---
Is it slow or what?
---
The fact is most people who liked fsllout liked it cause single player. And then they went and did this. I'm sorry but this game is like a huge grind not like any other fallout
---
Wait fuck wrong game
---
So there‚Äôs a new weapon dupe that involves vendors and if you go over to the market place people are pretty much giving away the legacy weapons the ones that aren‚Äôt in the game anymore.
---
I'd love to actually fight a Morgan, level 109 and have never met one.
---
Dude, just play a different game. You‚Äôre totally right, and every minute you spend doing their grind, you‚Äôre encouraging them to keep supplying it. It‚Äôs time the game community stuck up for itself and stops letting the industry feed us garbage. We want games that are fun to play when you buy them. We don‚Äôt want chores with pay to enter shortcuts. Video game revolution! Video game revolution! We want unlockables and rare weapons again! We don‚Äôt want microtransaction lootboxes! Enough is enough people! Rise up! Rise up, brothers! No more oppression!
---
Favorite them and use the wheel too. (If you hadn't)
---
What system do you play on?
---
I have no clue. I‚Äôd discuss it with my doctor if it didn‚Äôt cost $100 a visit. Yay America -_-
---
Tattered field jacket is still pretty rare.
---
I figured. I just really like the exploding bullets and the fact it takes 10mm.
---
rly? Did i pissed you off by asking for a "glitch" to decorate my camp?
---
I got a two star explosive one I think supressors. If you‚Äôre playing later come check it out. My gamer tag is KingSites1213
---
I don't mind a grind but I shouldn't have to play every single night for 3 hrs to get through it, and recieve the content. I love this game, and of course the only rewards I actually care for are halfway through and at like 90. I'll make it but shit If I miss a couple days ill have to pay even more
---
I set my SCORE goal very low - I 100% PS4 trophied FO76 and am working through doing the same for the wastelanders content. I just use the challenges to set side goals whilst doing my questing.
---
How much?
---
I have a machete so yeah that would probably be helpful also I‚Äôm level 2 if that matters üòÇ
---
PC
---
Sorry I just checked my vendor and it's Anti Armor not bloodied. I'm on PC, and it's yours for free if you want it
---
I‚Äôll do it for 2500
---
Collectron is alright for passive junk collecting if you want that, really everything else is just cosmetic
---
The contemporary camp bundle.
---
Okay! I‚Äôll come check it out later.
---
Thanks anyways :) xbox!
---
Why not buy some more games?
---
Nah theres a new one. But your fine he probably was just bein helpfull. Having low levels with limb damage shotguns is nice for events like rad rumble or the meditation thing.
---
I'll share Legendaries in Uranium Fever if others help out and actually play the event by repairing the extractors. I just did that event today and I had to collect all the steel and repair every extractor. I took the 3* to myself as payment. Play all parts of the event, don't just show up for the legendary. Especially when it's time to keep the fire going with kindling in Campfire Tales. I tried but that one is hard to do solo.
---
That‚Äôs why some people will do it. It‚Äôs a way to stick to the one that downed and kills you. While yeah it‚Äôs scummy. If it‚Äôs early enough in the match it‚Äôs better to dip out. Especially if you have nothing to drop. Let‚Äôs be real that guy that got you doesn‚Äôt want your pipe gun.
---
Np.  There is a 24 person limit per server. 
---
Fallout 1st helps too. 14 bucks a month including tax. You can create your own private server. A few other perks but the best is the unlimited scrap box since
---
there is a stash limit in this game.  Generally speaking weight will be your biggest enemy.
---
Because it's insanely overpowered.
---
My GT is same as username, I would enjoy battling the Queen. I also don't exploit the game, so I'm okay.  Haha
---
Send me a friend request GT: Petrichor Opiuo
---
Seems like there's more problems now than prior to the update.
---
True.  
---
But
---
Food and chems aside, the switchblade I mentioned above hits 3x in the same time it take a slower weapon to hit once, )so it does more damage in te same time frame,)
---
The FSS switchblade hits 4-5x.
---
Ok. I would have added you but im on PS4. All the best!
---
"I hope you don't mind me asking for a glitch. :I" 
---
why would you put that if you didn't think people might not like you asking.
---
Let me know when you're on and we can get you fitted out!
---
Thanks man, you too!
---
I said ‚Äúto me.‚Äù
---
Ok I will once I get on. My gt is KingSites1213 I‚Äôll be on in a little
---
Maybe lag? It doesn't take me that long to move stuff. The friends list slows down your gameplay. Some say because it's constantly updating online friends but I dunno about that.  I just know when I removed 200 friends or so I stopped having choppy gameplay
---
This is awesome, such a welcome change! Obviously the bugs are still there, but for those that have autocompleted challenges have a lot more wiggle room. I have almost worked my way back from missing two days of dailies and having 4/7 of mine auto complete one day.
---
Up to a limit of 30% maybe, 5 addictions have a lot more drawback than 5 mutations, pretty much everybody already runs around with several mutations.
---
Aqua girl/boy perk
---
Not really. The fridges are meh, the collectrons are fun but don‚Äôt generate a lot of scrap compared to what you, and the repair/scrap kits are of minor use if you plan ahead properly. 
---
Honestly, a skin for your favorite weapons and armor to avoid accidentally scripping them is more useful overall.
---
Poor Morgan. What did he ever do to you?
---
You know what that ‚Äúglitch‚Äù will get you?
---
Give people the ability to steal directly from your stash.
---
It‚Äôs my room.
---
But would Bethesda know that you're using a duped legacy weapon though?
---
I spotted a couple players hanging out a train station. On was close to level 200. The other was level 2.
---
I figure they're duping. So I crouch down and fast travel over. Pull out my pearly peepers and watch through the back door.
---
The high level is at the vendor. Low level runs up. They switch places. The low level disappears. High level takes his place talking to the robot vendor.
---
So I sneak up behind him. Hide right next to the door.
---
Low level guy shows up, high level guy backs up away from the vendor. I make my move, try to get in front of low level guy. 
---
I'm too slow and they see me. I get a bunch of thumbs down from them. Like I'm doing something wrong.
---
Good times. Imma try again later with my Chinese stealth suit on.
---
Mom said it‚Äôs my turn to be president

---
No that‚Äôs the problem people are duping them and then selling them for cheap so Bethesda would never be able to track them down unless the do a complete inventory wipe. But they will never do that
---
I read elsewhere that if the keycard isn‚Äôt working it‚Äôs because you grabbed the wrong one from his body. Apparently there‚Äôs multiple keycards but only one has the quest item indicator.
---
Ohh right. I'm not sure I have that card on my nw, version of my main.
---
Slap fight you for it!
---
I know battlefield, when they released their bugged br, you could get banned for quitting while downed. But it's tactics not thirsting. Lets you reposition, wait for the other teammates, downning adds a stack of adrenaline, but not right out killing. One the other side I've been killed many times because they got picked up.
---
I'll give you absolutely nothing for it.
---
I was trying to give a small gift to a level 2 &amp; when I thought I was close to them, they were a bit farther. So I chased a little &amp; by the time their name popped up, I noticed that they were running. I told myself, I'm not scary, am I? I'm a level 205 with T-65 PA. Not scary, right??
---
Yes. The new event (A Colossal Problem is the title I think) will be activated by nuking a certain area.
---
bitching about it on reddit seems to be the meta...
---
Why would someone dupe level 20 weapon?
---
It's the only thing on SCORE I'm working towards :) not long now . . .
---
oh, that's harsh!   
---
I may talk about it with my therapist one day but right now with all that Covid-19 thing going on in the world i still have more serious stuff to talk about. I'll try to remember and post a reply here.   
---
I wish you health, fellow Vault Resident!
---
A bit on the bonus part. 
---
If you have FO 1st and place your survival tent by the middle spawn (mountain side,  on the right side)  then ALL of the zombies spawn right by the console they‚Äôre trying to destroy. 
---
So as OP said above have a explosive weapon to tag them all,  then win win.
---
OVN has had this problem for awhile. Some Bloodied player told me when I yelled at him for it that he did it because he didn't want his health/rads messed up and he didn't want to carry a trash gun to avoid one shooting. 
---
Basically, selfish behavior. At least he didn't say "I'm a Raider. lol" üôÑ
---
To the death?
---
I understand that glitches are a higly debated topic in this Community. But i hoped for some other CAMP builder to help me out with a trick or a glitch. 
---
Not all glitches are bad! Many glitches are expanding the Experience and fun. Like for example a glitch to raise your Camp building buget.
---
You don't have to be so rude. :)
---
Yeah if they don‚Äôt bust it out this October/November I doubt it will even be on live servers
---
Mine auto completed yesterday, thankfully none did today.
---
Wiiild I most definitely have not gotten that lmao. I guess I should contact support?
---
You as well! May RNGesus bless you this fine night ^_^.
---
Close enough.
---
Btw my GT is xjs0072 so same as my Reddit tag with a 2 on the end.  I‚Äôm actually on xjs007 as well as my kid has taken to the Xbox a bit so I set her up with GamePass on xjs0072 that she lets me use sometimes lol - I‚Äôll probably end up making a character on xjs007 though as I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm going to buy the game for my main since it‚Äôs dirt cheap.  I think GamePass allows game sharing if both accounts are logged in on that Xbox so I‚Äôll hit you guys up once I get that sorted out.
---
‚ÄúTo the pain!‚Äù
---
Lol ok, you can doubt but if you check on ebay theres ppl selling thousands of them and I see people holding dozens of them out of nowere in the discord
---
Omg yes
---
7/9 autocompleted for me, first time it‚Äôs happened for me. I was playing during daily reset so it could definitely be related.
---
It‚Äôs weird thou as occasionally during play I get score being awarded even though my dailies would be complete already so who knows wtf is going on.
---
Yeah, I kind of suffer from FO4 being able to have a perk to carry anything so I pick up all I find...
---
Yet 14 bucks a month is too much right now, and I don't think we are going to play that much but will keep it in mind.
---
Thanks for the advise.
---
Lead is 14, steel is 20.
---
Hey man, it's not ez mode! So what if they have 57,000 different supporting effects and perks that perfectly synergize and let them kill Scorchbeasts in .5 seconds, have incredible carry weight, gain more xp, get better vendor prices, have vastly more AP, and still have decent survivability? It's balanced!
---
I keep hearing about these dupes but they're nowhere to be seen when I go shopping on PC.
---
 My furious power fist hits hard, but it‚Äôs a legendary cultist dagger that I enjoy the most. It‚Äôs so speedy and the 1st person drawing animation looks cool. When I remember to block it‚Äôll reflect 50% of the damage and it weighs 90% less, so it‚Äôs always in the inventory. 
---
It‚Äôs a wonderful knife.
---
You are right, the FOMO from players is an issue. Which means the problem is not the game, the problem is people‚Äôs attitude towards the game. Relax, do not take this fictional reality so seriously and all of the stress will disappear.

The current system piggybacks on the original system to pack up a CAMP when it conflicts with an existing one, pausing the process and giving you an option to abort and try again on a different world. None of that can happen until you actually run the loading process into a world. So what you'd get is the exact same thing you are seeing now, except instead of giving you the pop-up menu, it would just automatically dump out of the world and try again. It would save you a few mouse clicks, but not much in the way of time.
---
This is a great idea
---
tambo with swing speed! Am a drummer in real life, killin' em softly
---
There are ways that allow players to get duplicates of owned gear and other items.  Mostly on PC, but some of the glitches can occur on all platforms.  
---
There is a current issue going on right now that affects all platforms
---
Worlds have to load the player built objects load last and u guessed it CAMPS too... so yeah it sucks but thats how it be and that probably will never be fixed, anyways they have bigger issues...
---
There needs to be some aspect of luck in the legendary role system u can‚Äôt jus ask for the bad legendary effects to get removed and get a great weapon every roll
---
But I agree there needs to be a minor buff for effects
---
This is a pretty great idea.
---
You will run through the ghouls , until you reach the telephone booths on your left and you will jump untop them (with marsupial). Then you can shoot the ghouls that followed you from safety. You can hop again down to find further ghouls to aggro them, you run again to the booths and you waste them safely. Rinse and repeat.
---
Aside from poison and rads, it's really not as fragile as people try to claim it is. With dodgy, serendipity, and legendary effects like sentinel etc., the build has way more survivability than it has any right to.
---
That‚Äôs just leftover adrenaline in your blood. As we get older our bodies are not as quick to recover from it.
---
I feel you for radiation rumble. I also ping in the lfg channel when there's one. Most of the time, I ping it, people add me, we begin, I take all the ores, get no XP, event almost fails. Why? People are just sitting in a corner, masturbating. We were 8 in the event today. But if felt like we were two and a half. That's very upsetting.
---
I dont use one drive and cant figure it out.
---
Also make sure you repair armour to 200% and use the perk card to reduce materials needed for repair. Both help a lot.
---
Shut up and take my upvote you ingenious bastard
---
No there are not I checked
---
I dont get jokes
---
Umm imo games have been a grind since forever. Sure it's different with more progression, but think about super mario bros. You had to play levels over and over to beat them. Mega man was like that x10. Other games never ended. Maybe it wasn't meant to be a grind but it was to some extent. Just food for thought
---
Not all heros wear capes.
---
While I understand the frustration here, I have to disagree that games shouldn‚Äôt be a grind.  I‚Äôve been grinding video games since 1990 and I wanted to be max level on Final Fantasy.  The grind has definitely increased to the point it feels like a job, which is where the fatigue is setting in for everyone lately.  But to say that games shouldn‚Äôt be something you grind is flying in the face of every RPG since the dawn of gaming.
---
Why? It‚Äôs completely Bethesda‚Äôs fault.
---
White Springs
---
Good idea, ive been looking for an actual ise for those lol
---
The ones you own will say so, just gotta click which one you like in the shop. üëç
---
Best I can do is canned meat stew, what can I get for that?
---
The Battle Pass is literally almost all cosmetic items with the exception of caps and atoms, and nobody is forcing you to grind it out, its a FREE Battle Pass which rewards you FREE items for playing the game. Don't like it? Don't play it. Todd Howard isn't holding you at gunpoint forcing you to grind this game, so don't do it. Online games aren't for you since you can't handle spending a few hours a day playing the game.
---
I know, saw someone on Facebook getting banned for having this!
---
In case you are interested. I reached level 33 +100 Pts today, Iam a couple days ahead of schedule. Still no NW.
---
I wish there was an emote for sorry so bad, sometimes you fuck up and look like an ass and they do the angry emote and think you did so on purpose.
---
If you don't use one drive it should just be c:\users\(username)\documents there you should find the my games folder 
---
Or go into file explorer and find the documents folder on the left side.
---
There are 6 on eBay total right now 5 on pc and one on Xbox
---
Yes
---
Wow. Well. Hopefully they can get it appealed quickly, seeing as they are at zero fault. Thanks for the warning!
---
And better yet, not having to wield a protest sign when I level up!
---
Running through with my junkies 40 DCG one hitting everything.
---
They do survive explosions but not sure of nukes
---
i have a legendary death tambo that i love. it weighs nothing basically, under a pound, and slices through just about anything. I've had it since level 60 (I'm level 135 now) and still carry it for when i don't want to waste bullets.
---
Idk, bottom text is pretty controversial. Its hard to agree on the bottom text, but i completely agree with the top
---
They seem to be taking exploits linked with score rewards seriously because they plan on making money off of that!
---
Buttressed on limbs, jetpack on chest. No other mod on chest, don't need more dr and don't really know what else to put there.
---
Well, they're still standing after the war so my guess is that they'll be fine
---
Nice. Love the amount of detail you put into it.
---
 Also out of curiosity. What outfit is that.
---
It's basically why I don't bother with the precision rifles in the mode, 'cause I know I'm not gonna hit anything anyway.
---
Same with my unspecd bloodied ski sword,  I know my guy melee is sweet too.
---
It should get fixed as a priority oh wait, this does not matter as it doesn‚Äôt affect them getting money from players...
---
My teammate managed to survive several circles at bottom of the lake with their back against the grafton steel dam. When the circle was probably about a grenade throw in diameter, they finally got killed because the full squad figured that there was literally no where left to hide
---
Right. I understand banning people who used god mode. But plenty of people have purchased the t-65 Jetpack just to have it, so they‚Äôre able to craft this. I‚Äôm sure you agree, I‚Äôm just writing this out for the record.
---
holy
---
Oh yes I know that Bethesda themselves are 100% at fault with this one, as with many of these bugs, but at the moment Bethesda support seems to be in anti consumer mode, ignoring calls for help and banning people on sight!
---
Are you sure that last part isn‚Äôt the repeatable weekly being completed? It‚Äôs only 10k XP and easy to complete multiple times in a day just playing the game regularly.
---
I think 25 is pushing it
---
Get a microphone. Game is so much better when you can talk to folks.
---
&gt; As we get older our bodies are not as quick to recover from it. 
---
Now that's an interesting information. I'm 27 so i imagine i'm not as fit as i was in my teens but i didn't realize things can change that much before the 30's.
---
Learn it incase you change your build
---
Right on lol
---
Until this community and YouTubers are lighting their asses on fire regarding this, nothing will be done.
---
I strongly suspect the bug IS fixed internally but they're withholding that for the sweet Atom sales.
---
Listening to the cultists as they die is my favorite thing and reminds me Bethesda has a real sense of humor.
---
Sounds good. May be taking a break for a little. Already done two queen and a imposter run today lol.
---
SS chest Jet Pack and Dense depending on situation. No other SS armor used, Unyielding for the rest or troubleshooter for encryptid, silo.
---
Many thanks! 
---
It's the Grognak King Outfit from the Grognak bundle, and a Imposter Sheepsquatch head from Encryptid.
---
So drop this one and play the other ones? Gears of war made a turn based type of strategy game but I'm not complaining on their subreddit about how we deserve a 3rd person shooter
---
I mean I‚Äôm cool with having a jam session in a post-apocalyptic biker clubhouse without a sun-dried corpse thwacking me upside the head every 8 seconds.
---
the stat points dont really line up. Heavy gunner perks are strength and rifle are perception. You could make it work idk but it wouldnt be maximized.
---
Stabilized on both arms, basically makes aiming with rifles as if youre always holding your breath.
---
Cushioned on both legs, to heavily reduce fall damage.
---
Jetpack on chest.
---
Buttressed on all of them.
---
It's not very doable as they rely on different special and you'll be spreading a bit thin. Unyielding armor does let you blag things like vats a bit through the extra stats but the necessity for survival perks too is really going to stretch it.
---
How so? One gun is usually half of that or more.
---
Interesting combo. And ahh. That makes sense. I couldn't really tell due to the lighting made the outfit seem black rather than green.
---
You did not look very hard
---

---
Edit (Sorry if this breaks any rules)
---
Don‚Äôt worry mate.  They will almost certainly sell any cosmetics that can be earned in game. Hell they have sold almost, if not every unique item that was reward for pre order. If pre order items aren‚Äôt sacred then you can almost guarantee that nothing is sacred at this point. I‚Äôm willing to bet those items will rotate through the store multiple times with the now all familiar ‚Äú limited time‚Äù flair only to be sold again a few weeks later.
---
What else to do though, bitching on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) is just as pointless tbh. It's hard to just suffer these bugs in silence.
---
Hey mate, If you don‚Äôt like it in its current state then go find other things to do or play. The game may or may not improve to your liking. You don‚Äôt need random people to tell you what to do. 
---
There‚Äôs a lot of good stuff to play. Come back later and see how it is.
---
yea same not even paying attention to any of the challenges or wtv i lvl up often so i get some from that and just naturally unknowingly finish challenges its great i then check the map and see i have 3 rewards to claim
---
Damn I want that bunker
---
I didn‚Äôt really get what you were saying +35 weight in total or +25 per person because that‚Äôs an extra +100 weight on top of what ever you have so for me it would 445..... which yes it is a lot but there is a very little chance of that being a possibility but +25 in total is realistic
---
Buttressed all around of course
---
Dense or jet pack on chest, tho jet pack is a lot of fun.
---
Legs I prefer custom fit.  You may want cushioned if you don‚Äôt have 2 fall damage pieces, but cushioned will only help with minor falls.  As you get used to it, you should be fine.  Sleek does nothing if you have speed demon.
---
Arms I‚Äôm not sure.  I‚Äôve got it low priority til they add ultra light or deep pocket as they‚Äôve said they‚Äôre looking into it.
---
It‚Äôs fucking RAW!
---
And you don‚Äôt have to violate the rules of the sub. 
---
That‚Äôs *inherently* rude.
---
It's that goblin aesthetic üíö
---
Oh man i wish there was a black one. That would be sick.
---
Wow!! Can you post a screenshot of the location on the map?  I've been looking for a spot like this for a long time.  I've spent hours stumbling along cliffs and mountain sides, and finally threw in the towel when I found a stone archway (pretty well known).
---
Spots like this are really rare.  I found one other in the north west corner, but it was full of picnic tables and stuff you can't really build over and it was a bit smaller.  
---
Great find and excellent camp.
---
If you love fallout you can look past the major issues. Unfortunately I agree and its a bit gross it has gotten this bad.
---
I'm sure I read one is in the works. It could be handy. I'm guilty of thinking a torso shot will just wing it before now and still blown a legendary away. It does make you feel awkward.
---
Or Bethesda to steal directly from your bank account.
---
Inb4 a total NON answer, or promotion of the 150 Atom skip option.
---
The ONLY fix for this, is to actually FIX the bug, and put up some generous challenges for users to catch up for damn free.
---
They lied to the players.
---
1. That they fixed this bug, it was clear from near day 1 that something was off with that "fix"
---
2. That seasons could be completed for free, it's becoming quite clear that their is a focus albeit perhaps a minor one to take advantage of this bug to gain Atom sales.
---
The fact support continues to be as useful as a stud on a lesbian porno set really does set the tone of the upper echelons at Bethesda mentality regarding said issue and how it could potentially if the community sucks it up hand them a tidy profit increase to give to shareholders.
---
Ok thank you so much for your input
---
Indeed it would.
---
I see ok well what do you recommend staying in rifle or going over to heavy would would you recommend?
---
Just asking for opinion on the playability from the people who have sunk a lot of time into it, not looking to be told what to do lol just that the people here will know a lot more about the game than I do.
---
grinds in games can be fine, but bethesda decided that every single element of 76 HAD to be a grind and needed a cap and to be being timegate and RNG.
---
it would be one thing if bethesda actually fixed the game and added actual new activities to do at a reasonable pace. but they really dont, and all that leaves is grinds that normally wouldn't take up everyones primary focus all the time.
---
Tell me about it. Just started using them this week. *literal* game changer.
---
Or work in groups. Even my avatar is introverted.
---
As someone who has played most of the fallout titles I'm kinda biased I would say but the way I go about the worth of a game is if I can spend a lot of time playing the game. If the game has enough content to keep me engaged. Then it's worth the buy. I have about 400 hours into this game and it is worth every penny of the 40 bucks I spent on it. So because it's free it's definitely worth the download. After all you didn't spend any money and worst case is you hate it.
---
Same thing happened to me last night. I know some of them by heart which is only way I found some but no special icon map key or anything.
---
Like a Magneton
---
not sure if this is intended or not but i found it hilarious. First time i met them i heard all their dialogues, then i killed Dino which made Carla hostile. Finding them again i kill Carla first and Dino just kept sitting in his chair minding his business as if he waited for 50 years for someone to free him.
---
I had someone see me in my bush and noobtube me once. They must have thought I died because they ran right on by me and I was able to heal up. Managed 3rd that match lol.
---
I'm not saying that they should give us a different game, there doing us right by adding more daily challenges. The grind shouldn't be such a grind. If the seasons are free it should be that way, not a oh i missed a week out of the 10 and now have to pay even more than I was going to have to to begin with. A lot of the prizes could've been condensed together. Like the camo Armour that they made each different type a different prize. Same with PA skins. All skins actually. Or if they really feel like they should help us more. When the buy a lvl thing comes out give us a couple  expensive choose a reward option.
---
Absolutely friend. Once I'm home later I'll pop ya a screenshot. 
---
And I was in the exact same boat honestly. There are so many mountains but so little caves, overhangs and cool features for them.
---
Hahaha, perfect!
---
Probably not. Maybe you sent toxic messages to someone or something.
---
Do you get them monthly? I paid for the annual pass but only got the initial atoms after paying.
---
Not particularly. Low health builds also benefit from the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage perk. I know some people out there blend the junkies and bloodied builds but I don't know much about that.
---
Give it some time.  The new dupe will have outfits popping up now.
---
&gt; welcome to my nightmare
---
I think I'm going to like it.
---
Axepalachia
---
I had trouble back in the days when switching to a sniper rifle of some sort, ending up bare handed...looks like a rifles thing... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
While controlling one's breath is actually useful for controlling anxiety i kind of doubt it's something i could do while playing NW. But i'll try.
---
If you want to try something different it might be worth starting a new character. I'm currently changing my bloodied melee over to rifles and it is a huge chore.
---
I would say ETA 9:30 (in 40-45mins).  Thanks!
---
Oooohhh very cool. ThanksüòÉ
---
I'm lazy, i just buy it in bulk from the whitesprings vendor shops.
---
Lol I bet ok thanks for your input really appreciated
---
Ashy Slashy!
---
Definitely getting Shape if Water vibes from this.
---
Never played a mmo have you?
---
Yeah I've used other weapons fine . Just happens with my fixer
---
Yeah I understand. You can get a lot of varying opinions. I like the game (bugs and glitches), and Ive got over 2000+ hours since launch. Others are hating on it. 
---
Give it a go. See how you like it. Do some teams. Don‚Äôt worry too much about those that can one-shot/one-hit everything.
---
How does one do the PA glitch?
---
But I think you'll be ok man you do need the 20 tin cans
---
Yes, +25 per teammate with a total of +100 carryweight. Most of Fallout 76 isn't realistic so why does it matter if this is realistic? Why would someone suddenly gain a telepathic connection with four random people spread out over WV and become smarter or more charismatic because of it? It's a videogame, and these are just bonuses to help the players and encourage team play.
---
It's a shitty thing to do. Having hard dailies and not enough score would one thing. This seems like a way to scam people into thinking they could do it
---
Okay, im sorry. I didn't want to make a scene like that. I have just read through the rules again and yes you are right I grossly violated "Rule 8". As I said before I did not want to trigger such a drama here but just asked for a glitch / trick to beautify my camp. Should I delete the post?
---
Damn
---
Downing players and being able to pick them up is a staple of the battle royale genre. What we need is, as an option, a proper solo mode where everyone queues up solo and where there are no teams at all.
---
Same all bos combat but my chests and arm is ss
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt know how to explain it
---
Sounds good buddy see ya then
---
Not like real world realistic like it‚Äôs not going to happen realistic I don‚Äôt see them even doing that jsut because they don‚Äôt listen to the community
---
K
---
Oh, well in that case, I couldn't agree more!
---
A lot of people, myself included, do not want gifts from other players that will blow out the balance of the early game. I usually try to indicate that I am not going to pick up the gift, but some people don't get it.
---
iirc everyone needs their own card (gamelogic of the system needs to identify each player i guess)  but beside that all the rest of the silo progress is shared
---
That‚Äôs a pail buddy, it takes about 100 of those to get a backpack
---
I have no time for idle chitchat!
---
I highly doubt they would include it with a brotherhood of steel quest line but maybe they will get their own expansion
---
And I feel if they did that it would defeat the purpose of the other teams because everyone would be on that one
---
Thank u for ur honest answer nice human
---
üëçüèª
---
I used to have this happen to me when I was using a sniper rifle. I never found a fix for it.
---
Lol your actually dumb, duped pails = duped contents of pails
---
lol my friends and i were hanging out at the overseers camp today greeting noobs and gifting them starter gear and healing stuff in little welcome packages and about half of them just straight bolted away refusing to take what we were offering. it was fun though, trying to lure them out of hiding all careful like.
---
It's aggravating....lol
---
You *don't*?
---
Umm, Skyrim? lol
---
Besides, why not re-release a hugely popular game on a new console? there are always new people getting into gaming that won't have played it, plus people who want to play it in better quality (for a console). If I was in charge over there I'd definitely do it.
---
Easiest way to explain SCORE;
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/S.C.O.R.E](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/S.C.O.R.E).
---
I always do this and have only noticed a problem a few times but never the problem mentioned above. Usually, the problem is only temporary (like when the game crashes) and when you relaunch it loads back into the private world you left but there are times when it is not such a simple problem (lost a few things trying to do this once when Bethesdas server crashed). If that were not bad enough there are times when my private world crashes and I am unable to get back into it (gives an error message when trying to open the private server but normal servers work fine). Therefore, my advice is to only send things you do not mind losing using that method. Then for the rest of the stuff, you should find a good trustworthy friend or purchase an alt account to help so you can give them the items, swap toons, and have them give the items to the new toon. That way if the server crashes for some reason you never lose the loot since it will be on your friend/alt account.
---
Yes, it's a key part of making the build effective. So does the damage bonus that is part of Nerd Rage.
---
Was that you who drunkenly bought the Nuka-cola My Blood is in it for 30k today at my vendor?
---
Try to contact Xbox support. They are the only ones who can tell you the reason :)
---
Nice! I'm thinking of priming my Gatling Plasma. Bit worried about having to farm ammo for it tho, but I only use it in boss fights then switch to my Gatling Gun for everything else. Does it chew ammo or is it sustainable?
---
I turn off grass. It gives a very significant FPS bump (I'm playing at 4k on a 2070, so I need a little help) and it makes it much easier to find bodies.
---
This is exactly what I go through when it comes to anything PvP related
---
Tasty squirrel soup is better, but the recipe is hard to get. Overall, herbivore is probably slightly better for most players because you don't have to get the recipe for brain bombs, it's just nice to. If you have the tasty squirrel soup recipe though carnivore is much better.
---
cola nut and cola spam and you can tank them easy
---
Double xp next weekend should help.
---
Usual food buffs, use building teams.
---
Craft a shielded vault suit with your other character and transfer over if you can.
---
THE SPICE. MUST. FLOW.
---
Level up until you can hop around to public events, then do that. Join an event or builders team. Eat cranberry cobbler. 
---
If you have it, wear low level unyielding armor and bloodied weapons to boost your INT
---
It could be 10/15/20/25 lbs. That sounds reasonable and not too OP
---
I mean u could if you dont mind not having intelligence or agility or smthin. Maybe you could go minimal luck? Like it could work, im not tryna discourage you
---
Nope, but if it had been Nuka Scorched I may have. No one ever sells any and it's all I need for my collection of those 3 from the storyline.
---
It's designed to make people pay. It's messed up but if it gets people to take out their wallets then it'll be a win for bethesda
---
Sometimes the icons are there, sometimes not. It‚Äôs been like this for the past week, at least that I noticed.
---
Wait you guys are caught up to zorbo?!
---
Yeah, I do. I believe at any time, any place, people can fall in love with each other. But... if you love someone, you have to be able to protect them.
---
We're all in this together! Just trying to get our legendary stuff done üòÅ
---
triple barrel on the missile launcher is the largest I can think of, its 25 lbs I think.
---
Actually either form of dont or don't is correct one is possessive the other is non descript
---
You kinda get that with power user or the repair bobblehead for fusion cores but yeah. I'd be down with specific perk/item to help with the AP cost
---
I don't see why you're getting downvoted. Limited/exclusive is meant to play on FOMO, people grinded hard to complete these challenges in the timeframe for the exclusives and now they're available for everyone again. I personally didn't bother the first time around either, but I can see why the people who did are frustrated.
---
Touch√©!  Huzzah!
---
Not necessarily, the other teams are much more useful. Intelligence leads to more XP, event team gives you more reward from events, etc. Carryweight just allows you to carry more desk fans. I don't see them as equal at all, I think carryweight would have less of an affect than the original teams.
---
The fact that those that played on Bethesda launcher didn't retroactively get achievements sucks...
---
You can do exactly the same thing in FO76.
---
I regret my choice to get a diploma to know this still.
---
Well yeah but then vendors get shut down
---
You are choosing to grind.
---
They have given you that choice.
---
Good for them.  They gave you what you wanted.
---
Yeah I did find a few that I didn't see any info about on reddit or youtube, but they were known. Sadly wherever I do find stuff like this, it was added by Bethesda specifically so they could fill it with crap to make an interesting unmarked location.  The one in the north west is a little less wide than yours, but a lot deeper.  Sadly, it has picnic tables, tents, skeletons, etc in there so it's totally useless.
---
I actually find it offensive that you can't straight up agree, and the fact you find it 'controversial' is sickening. Are you some kind of Bottom-textist?
---
\+15 INT.   It's literally stupid not to do it.  45% more XP?  Sure, thanks.
---
I didnt read the level
---
There fun at low level because super sneaky and quiet.
---
Yup, I've noticed this a lot with my automatic laser rifle.
---
The players have learned XP is the most valuable asset RN. For violent night, stand outside of the back door and tag things as they run in. Don't play any instruments, just run the juke box. When you see legendary bad boi tag him and let others do the damage.
---
Radiation rumble is the same. It's XP farming. No one cares about success. If you want it to succeed just get 25 ore and also do some farming.
---
Expect a lot of players just XP farming. Take advantage of it now as I suspect players will soon be less on the events as people start hitting 100 and passing the enemy piece on the legendary board.
---
I need someone with the perk so I can have an extra caw out on my mole miner gauntlet, and I need a instigating FSS+1STR DC gauntlet (I have the extra claw mod &amp; bones)
---
Edit: I‚Äôll pay for both
---
yes its fun, but people will always cry and bitch about the meta.
---
ran a vanguard junkies/vamps build for 200 levels it was fucking boring and easier than the bloodied build, i almost never died, ever. its not harder, its just slower and more boring.
---
bloodied at least makes it so that i have to pay attention to whats happening,
---
That's an outstanding design. Making use of terrain is great.
---
Pity about the Scorchbeast, but it does seem rather fitting for your character.
---
Yeah I thought of that but it wasn‚Äôt 100 score, it was 250 and 500 and occasionally 1000.
---
So who knows...
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs not already broken down?
---
Ok this is exactly what happened to me today as well, I had the same dailies automatically marked as complete and the same two as you left uncompleted. I had left my character logged in afk during reset and when I came back it was like this.
---
If you don‚Äôt like the jetpack, I‚Äôd definitely recommend dense for the chest; it really helps reduce the explosive damage. I have sleek for the legs, as I‚Äôm stealth commando (although I hear you only need one leg like that). Stabilized for the arms.
---
Erhmahgurd is a tough one to get decent stuff from.  I put stuff I don't want back through the vendor or sell it in my machine
---
Have you tried a dif character slot
---
The shelter survives nukes, the occupant... Not so much!
---
Your not out of the running double xp weekend and double score weekend comming up and I'm sure if people keep having these auto completed of dailies happend there is gonna be more double days.  They will make sure most people get the rewards just like the clean up scorch thing.
---
Some dude kept lobbing grenades at me in it and they didn't hurt me so that was awesome
---
Yeah I really feel for those folks, but at least they got to enjoy the game a lot sooner.
---
Probably games been broke since they shut down players vending few weeks ago. Wouldnt doubt it if they broke the coding right before season update then tried a cosmetic fix resulting in a trickle down of glitches  and they dont want to admit it
---
I have about 300 assaultron recall keycards
---
Spaghetti code on spaghetti code spaghetti üçù
---
This behavior has been occurring quiet frequently at all the different events I have gone too sadly. Some people only think of themselves, it's pathetic if you ask me. Why do they even bother to play on a public server with others? I'll never understand it and there's no way to rationalize it.
---
Extra serum recipes are a solid trade item.
---
Oh yeah I just love having a 90% reduced weight Gatling gun that weighs 10lbs.
---
Wym there were people trading Gat plasmas like crazy
---
You're fine. Delete the post.
---
Poggers on more red shift and mothman stuff
---
If you are on Ps4, I'll buy it for 4500 caps.
---
But, seriously, you should be fine.
---
How dare you assume that i may or may not be a bottom-textist, you sir shall hear from my lawyer about this. Good day
---
Then there is no benefit at all. 10 pounds is only an  assault rifle, or 2-3 desk fans.
---
Yeah the items don't have unique IDs. 
---
Also what if you were a new player and had no clue the value of the weapon therefore not being able to assume it was duped.
---
You'll be fine just dont engage in the exploit itself.
---
Funny story, first event with my unarmed guy I was like ohh I should just bash this so I don't one shot it
---
Oh.. melee.. ya.  Why isn't there an "I'm sorry guys" emote again üòÇüòÇüòï
---
If you're unable to place the tent you're probably too close to an existing structure.
---
No i havent been able to use the scrapboc either
---
I believe all the gas masks used to give negative perception too but they don't anymore
---
Do u actually know if it works... like confirmed??
---
This is not the only way it happens.
---
I came home and logged in 8 hours after the change, after not playing since the night before and had over half of my dailies and have of my weeklies already done when I logged in.
---
I just gun bash stuff in every event. Thats good enough for a tag but doesnt kill anything.
---
I realized after my first login since seasons were released that it feels like I have a chores list instead of a fun game to play. I hated coming to that realization. I love the Fallout series. I've pre-ordered each FO game since Fallout 3, including Fallout 76. I think I'm done with 76 though. My last play through didn't feel fun. I was just checking off "chores'. I haven't even been able to play long enough to unlock the ammo converter. Between that and all the limits on currency and all the different currencies, I feel like I just don't have the time to keep up. I love the FO 76 world though. The environment, locations, and most quests are great. I hate to leave it but I think I've already started stepping away. I still watch this sub waiting for some good news.
---
That's what I'm trying to find out. Not sure.
---
Up to you.
---
Omg I love it hahah! Your campfire looks so cozy \^\^ I can't wait till I get the plushie but I think I am a good bit aways still xD
---
I'll take that we AA 10mm smg if you still have it. 3 star?
---
I used a shotgoun
---
 Each pellet counts as a crit
---
The recommended levels:
---
The Forest - Levels 1 to 10
---
Toxic Valley - Levels 10 to 25
---
Savage Divide - Levels 15 to 99
---
Ash Heap - Levels 25 to 35
---
The Mire - Levels 30 to 99
---
Cranberry Bog - Levels 35 to 99
---
You might be going a bit too fast
---
It's the only way to play really. Yeah, we could probably one-shot it, but that's crappy, selfish behavior. There's only one type of person who doesn't do it...
---
Do side quests in the Forest and Toxic Valley until you hit about level 25 then try again.
---
I‚Äôm gonna say that I LOVED the way Red Dead Online does the battle pass.
---
Normal XP is how you ranked it up, so literally just playing the game gave you ranks. Never had to check challenges or join groups, you just did what you wanted to do that day.
---
Man that was the smoothest most natural feeling battle pass I have ever experienced.
---
Interested! I'm not always available to be on but I'd love to join if I can.  Tag is dchec.
---
I think it is intended I ran into them today and I uh sorta power fisted carlas head off and Dino was basically like ‚Äú have a good night man ‚Äú and just sat there lol
---
Yeah I have no game that I have to play on my main drive at over 650+ games. Hopefully Bethesda puts a fix out for this.
---
This is why I've been playing NW. Trying my best to get him.
---
Honestly, I like this change. Makes it easier to get the 'get 5 dailies done' one without NW or gaining a level (sometimes easier said than done)
---
What do you mean by this? You have one placed at your camp and you can't open it? Are you trying to use a regular stash?
---
Considering this is the first day since the season started that‚Äôs had more challenges, I‚Äôm inclined to say it‚Äôs a bug. Either that, or some days might just occasionally have extra challenges
---

---
Check that out! It worked for me.
---
So far it's only useful on melee weapons and heavy guns, where the mod slots are so minimal not much weight gets added, where a 90% reduced weight rifle can still weigh over 20 when modded up!
---
I've been stocking up on reduced weight broadsiders to set up cannons in my camp!
---
You on Xbox? I have 2 pieces of decent unyielding and I might have a bloodied weapon or two. I‚Äôve basically stopped playing Xbox entirely since starting escape from tarkov
---
Nothing really besides FO 1st for the unlimited scrap storage. That‚Äôs about it for actual in game benefit
---
You took the words right out of my mouth! I feel like I keep asking myself why I am torturing myself like this, and for what? It's like all my love for this game is slowing dying after being run over by a truck in the guise of "something more engaging for the players" it's utter madness!!! You're so right, there's plenty of amazing games out there to play and doing the same events in F076 is the driving us to insanity lol.
---
Bethesda's customer support answered me up until the point of i asked what was next, its so frustrating to really screw over the people who are so loyal to this game
---
Only good mothman is a dead mothman.  Mothman Hunt Festival!
---
No like i cant place one down and every time i try to put something in my scrap box it doesnt work
---
This is exactly why my wife will not play NW.  When I first started I had some anxiety and stress, but that went away when I stopped taking it so seriously.  I still get the adrenaline, but now it's much more fun and I actually do better.. not including the occasional stupid moments where I do something I know I shouldnt just because it's fun like taking on a group of geared up players alone (hasn't worked out for me just yet..)
---
"Dont take life so seriously, it's not like your going to make it out alive"
---
You didn‚Äôt name any specific issues. What exactly is bothering you about your gameplay experience so far?
---
Gotta agree. First outlaw pass I was like "wait, I don't have to kill six beavers while wearing a top hat or something?".
---
Until they let us pay for score level up, then they will fix it. Guaranteed lol
---
If you are on a pub server and a high level walks thru first the enemies will be closer to their level
---
In our clan we are swimming in legendaries because not only do we share during events we call out three stars to everyone when we are out and about. You would be amazed at how many more chances you get doing this. especially on a Saturday when their may be more than a dozen people on. 
---
Pro-tip, if you don't have a baby weapon just gun bash them, if you are an OP melee build carry a level one walking cane to whack them with or better yet a level one pipe pistol. If you can get a low level vampires all the better you get some free healing as a bonus.
---
We may or may not have dropped some nukes on peoples bases that do this. I can not confirm or deny this horrid allegation.
---
Same here. Must be a bug
---
You should look at the drop rate üòπüòª
---
All the content bugs, just kinda takes you out the experience really which is frustrating because the new wastelanders content seems really good and enjoyable.
---
I suggest swap points, blocker 3 is a must, serendipity 3 is a must, i usually use 1 point nerd rage just for ap regen (its okay loosing some damage cuz using lower rank,1shooting things anyway). And take glowing blood and radx diluted while fighting ghouls (i dobt bother to farm radshield). That's 175 rad res, since ghouls doing alot of radiation damage.
---
This worked! Thank you so much.
---
If you log into an adventure or private server and then go back to menu and enter nuclear winter it won't autocomplete them. It seems to happen when you go right into NW after launching the game.
---
I *knew* I was seeing more than normal!!
---
Yeah seems a bit of a shame since the content is clearly there, could be an amazing game
---
Lag.  Reset everything including network devices.
---
So do you have first? Did it expire? Did you buy it while in game? Have you server hopped or fully restarted? If you've tried everything you're going to need Bethesda support, not Reddit.
---
Not really. Pick one or the other. Perception gets you both rifle types and both bow types. Strength gets you unarmed, both types of melee, heavy guns, and shotguns.
---
Yea 1.5 percent for those ones and if your on a character under lvl 5 its ever higher if you buy 1000 pails youll get 15-50 for like 20$ god dam im done with this you fallout sheep are too much
---
You still didn‚Äôt name a specific issue? What exact content issues are bothering you? We can‚Äôt tell you if it‚Äôs an issue that is also affecting us if you don‚Äôt specify an issue.
---
I guess if I‚Äôm answering your sentiment generically then no, I don‚Äôt find the game particularly buggy in a way that detracts from my enjoyment of the game. On XBox One X I get good frame rate and I haven‚Äôt hit a show stopper bug. Crash rate these days doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue for me. So I‚Äôm having a good time with the game and I‚Äôd recommend you give it a chance.
---
Join public Building teams for the INT boost.
---
I don‚Äôt know I feel like carry weight is superior, in my opinion so I think that would be the team everyone goes in
---
Cause you are so wrong you are able to see that.
---
They did do a wipe after the first weapon dupe. They deleted any extras characters had and left them with only one. https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/14/18225540/fallout-76-duped-item-exploit-purge-patch-pc-xbox-one-ps4
---
On the looking for groups posts on Xbox there is a lack of people openly duping and trading and the market is less insane with legacy‚Äôs
---
I know someone that has completed it legitimately
---
I use rifleman but use a shotgun at times with blocking armour and it solid.do use a heavy no perks on spongy enemies.doesnt melt them but def gets the job done
---
There are perk cards, if you can spare them. The backpack mod from the possum vending machine has one that will keep food but it also makes it so that you can carry less in the backpack.
---
Yeah, got a reply nice minigun that's actually usable in late game.
---
But if I put the only good MOD on it it jumps from 2 pounds to like 19.
---
Thanks game.
---
You are just leaving A lot of XP behind at the Whitesprings not killing all the Sentry Bots. 1700k XP per when INT is around 50.
---
so that explains it for some other times it happens 
---
thanks for the help
---
Yes please. Mods need to be reduced as well.
---
Did you get help?   I can pop on.  Dm me
---
Used a b 1 star just to rid the 10mm ammo I have and it melts
---
I just use nuka colas of different flavor to heal depending on the situation
---
Please no
---
Your inventory and stash are gonna fill up very quickly if you were a hoarder in fo4
---
i havent been able to invite anyone in 2 weeks.
---
and the odd time someone got in they got booted instantly
---
They need to get over themselves and just need to make it so XP shares with people within twenty yards, or at least a group.
---
I guess the fact there is hundreds of them on discord atm being sold means how they are gotten makes a diff rofl nitpicking. Ima go back to finding things in vendors ig
---
I haven't seen these words in so long, they genuinely made me laugh out loud.
---
Because everyone would be in that team instead of the other ones
---
I've been using secret service chest with solar limbs because they can have ultralight, and switch out for a solar chest when I'm on a team, it's been pretty effective :)
---
I have a aaexp ultracite laser weaker of the lasers and it is a monster.not lucky enough to find a bfixer yet
---
Yeah. Me too. Even when someones tries to grief me (which they can't because i'm a pacifist) but they keep harassing me at the Microphone.
---
Can love bloom on the battlefield?
---
I haven't even been able to invite. We get booted when we join. This is really getting on my nerves
---
Still seems really bugged. I picked up a weapons case for his quest 2 weeks ago and he refuses to take it. Just keeps telling me to go and play. Put him away, planted a different ally and took him back out, tried relogging, tried restarting the game. Can't destroy the item either. /Sigh
---
Show me the same quantity being sold on a consol, (Xbox or PS4) and I‚Äôll delete my Reddit account or give you the password
---
I did that too and managed to buy a red asylum outfit. If you can't buy an item, just hog the vendor and make them go somewhere else.
---
Just shoot them in the head. Fixed with a 10mm
---
Something that hunts for plans would be sick too
---
I dont trade unless someone wants something from me. I do this so i have the leverage to tell people to drop first. Soo i basically never trade.
---
ok... so the mission i‚Äôm at is in the savage divide but i guess 16 don‚Äôt cut it 
---
i have a mission called ‚Äúbureau of tourism‚Äù and it‚Äôs in the toxic valley, would that be better to do ?
---
But what do you do to not take it seriously?
---
*Does.
---
Armor penetration is very important it‚Äôs why you do 100 damage to a foul and 3 to a Scorch beats queen
---
I forgot about those. I used to stock up on like 5 at a time running through whitesprings
---
Yes! I try to hoard a lot, I only pay for first every so often so I try to stock up on stuff
---
Bloodied isn't always about damage. I use my one for increasing my Charisma and Luck stat. I make up for lost damage with limited cards by using bloodied weapons. Right now that toon is ranking up fast with a 50 intelligence even though I only have eight in that SPECIAL. This particular was built to spawn more legendaries and have higher durability drops. It is actually my favorite character to play even though I have others that put out way more damage.
---
Yea i dont mind them just hitting the 1k damage mark but 1 thing that annoys me is all these level 50-100 + people stand on top of the bunker and chill there and shoot her like a madman while staggering her with explosive bullets and they all get on their mics and question mark emote saying "why isn't she landing!" That's one of the annoying things about these fights . Before I wouldnt care because you know you could cripple her but it's especially annoying now that you can't .
---
Replace canned meat stew with Tasty Squirrel Stew for 20% xp gain instead of the 10% from canned meat stew.
---
Also if you run Strange In Numbers it boosts the benefit of Carnivore or Herbivore so you get another 20% more xp boost from meat or plant food buffs. So the above become 12% for the canned meat stew and 25% for squirrel stew.
---
Also don't forget Egg Head mutation, which is also boosted by Strange In Numbers (this is a pretty big one!).
---
It's not that crazy of a benefit though? Congrats, you can carry more desk fans. With the others, you level up faster, you get more XP from events, all of which have more impact than being able to carry more scrap or an extra gun.
---
Everyone's already always in events. Shit I just want a general xp increase
---
Parade of the Fat Snatch eh?
---
I mean my first post did say it seemed to be a pc thing which is why i suspect spawning...
---
It is tedious but killing snakes in Conan was just as bad, lol.  I'm happy I at least have a way to recoup my ammo I am never going to use to ammo I will use.   To be honest though I have no idea why you would have 5k of ammo you are never going to use.    I am interested in hearing why though because the way I play I would never have that much stuff I am never going to use in my stash, course I am only 34 at this point.    Would love to hear reasoning behind that, thanks for the post.
---
I think there needs to be A LOT more around Mothman! More quests, more everything
---
Youd be looking for team bonus. 10 lbs would be 0 teammates
---
My Instigating 40SS 1Str has carried me for almost 150 levels ive seen it max out at 4800 damage on that first hit an 2400 after.
---
My Furious DCG is the backup but ill say the MMG is better...plus yea it takes up half my screen
---
Exactly, and when she doesn‚Äôt land and it takes nearly 20 minutes for her to mutate because of people like that. It‚Äôs really infuriating.
---
Well, we know the 90% WR perks for chems, ammo etc work just fine without equipping anything. Since 'chems" are a subcategory of the aid tab, we know they have some invisible tag to separate the two. It shouldn't be hard to create a new tag to discriminate weightless weapons.
---
Hell, if there's extra time, they may as well fully rework legendary affixes so they consistently apply *after* mods; instead of the mess we have now.
---
When is the next update or patch for 76? The one that reworks the UI for the Ammo Converter and the fix for this one? Because I am scared to do my Nuclear Winter Challenges until I know it is fixed. Please reply with any answer, I hope it isn't in the next major update, hopefully it can be hot fixed in game soon.
---
If your on xbox and need an ago player, just hit me up if im online. I dont mind holding back so you get the kill/xp
---
I did two things which seemed to help.  I updated my video drivers (NVidia) and set my fallout76.exe to run in Windows 8 Compatibility mode (I launch using a desktop shortcut to it, not the Bethesda launcher)
---
Nice! Kinda jealous. I got a ve yesterday but trying to sell anything with this duping going on is pointless. Everyone and their mother is gonna have a legacy before monday.
---
As another person mentioned, don't have NW be the last game mode you played.  Go back to the main game.
---
Either way, having an extra 15/20/25 would have barely an impact and not many people would choose this team over +4 Intelligence/Charisma/etc.
---
That's really nice now you don't have to play daily and not miss one to get max or at least close. Good move
---
The only reason I do Stings and Things is that it occasionally gives you a possum badge.

So 25 per teammate. So max at 100 extra. Combine that with the giant carry weight people already somehow have and they can get around 500 max carry weight. If bethesda realises that then they won't do it. If they don't realise it then no one will have to worry about their 100 desk fan collection again
---
I just want bethesda to fix her and make her become crippled again that's all I want so we dont have to deal with her flying antics anymore
---
What you want me to list all the bugs of this game? Um would be here a while lol biggest issues ignoring the visual ones are: hits not registering, enemies not attacking, enemies stop attacking, enemies too high leveled to kill in my personal quests, shot through walls, hitting invisible barriers, enemy health all over the place when the same levels (some really easy so kill some complete bullet sponges), last one might be game design tbh but weapons feel underpowered Vs melee. So basically just around general bugs that's why I didn't list them.
---
Edit: not experienced all those personally but between me and the friends who played a few hours at least one of us was annoyed by all of those issues
---
That is a good reason, I suppose I should pick it up again.
---
Buttressed for limbs, jetpack on one chest, and deep pocketed for another chest. I have a mouse with macros on it that are the same as 1-= on the keyboard, so I can instantly switch between looking nice and needing to get high up in an instant.
---
Post a tour, blue
---
I don‚Äôt really play it. I usually avoid those challenges and didn‚Äôt do them or log in to NW this week.
---
Yep. Weight is your biggest enemy in this game.
---
For the first 30 levels or so just do the main quests and explore. The main quest unlocks a lot of crafting stations and items you will need for your camp.  
---
Be social and get a mic. A level 200 plus friend can and will give you all the stimpaks and ammo you will need. 
---
Eventually you will need to decide on a build.  You only get to add special points until level 50 so you cannot max out all your attributes (like strength, perception) to 15.  You will have to decide on what weapons and play style you like.
---
Hell what‚Äôs worse is when they hit her with explosives and she takes off back into the nuke zone and comes back full health without mutating
---
Pc is a hack fest, you can do whatever there and shoot ppl through a wall with a impossible gun
---
I think I missed it because they put marine armor after it for some reason.
---
Bro it‚Äôs a SEASON pass. Meaning items are limited time. By your logic they might as well go ahead and get rid of the game board and just release everything in the atom shop right now. And besides, they are gonna give everyone the option to buy ranks with atoms eventually. I don‚Äôt agree with a season pass even being in this game. But it‚Äôs all just lame cosmetics anyway so I can put up with it. The problem with this game is all these players that only care about cosmetics and camp building. But totally neglect the fact that this game is offering zero good gameplay content for ‚Äúreal‚Äù fallout fans.
---
I feel you lol could definitely get some good use out of that emote.
---
The raider and settler daily‚Äôs are worth doing because of the blueprints that you can get and IMO the best events are project paradise and scorched earth (the scorch beast queen) sorry if it‚Äôs the wrong name. Encryptid is also fun but that‚Äôs an expensive one as it takes 2k caps to start.
---
As for the above. I agree, the terminal should let you access all available dailies, assuming you‚Äôve unlocked them.
---
It exploits human nature though. The only reason we react so strongly is because it‚Äôs an instinct built into us. I‚Äôve only played about 5 hours of Fallout 76, but in that time I‚Äôve decided to completely ignore the Legendary Run. It has good stuff, but I would have to play the game as a job in order to get it. The issue is, some people have mental conditions that make it difficult to make choices this, encouraging them to spend money to finish the Run. It‚Äôs a bad system implemented to prey on people with predispositions just like loot boxes. Fuck Bethesda for making progression through this thing so incredibly sluggish and fuck the industry for normalizing this exploitation.
---
Yeah I use a regular old fixer I‚Äôve had forever that I use for UF. Shoot it in the leg and wait. Have had a couple guys who don‚Äôt respond to the wave so it‚Äôs fun to try to get the legendary to chase you around the arena
---
Wendigo Colossus be punching air rn
---
&gt;Being a "Settler" or a "Raider" is merely a framing device through which  we can distinguish between the two societal groups that have cohered  around the basis of shared interests, values, backgrounds, and kinship 
---
... You just described a political group.
---
As for Ward, my point is that they accept him... and do nothing to stop him from doing raider-ish things for them. Such as taking from needy people, often with deadly force (see: every quest we do for him). He hasn't "escaped the life". He's their personal little raider, doing what they want to pretend they are not willing to do for their behalf. Being able to brush their hands and say "not me" does not make them any less complacent. Which makes the shoot on sight comment disingenuous, because both parties are guilty of murder for survival. The raiders are just more blatant about it.
---
I'm not saying the raiders are anything but a force of evil. I'm saying that the settlers are no better, they just hide behind a front man for their sins.
---
Do I know what English is?
---
B2525 fixer is the one
---
They‚Äôve announced a game wide enemy normalization pass due soon that sounds like it will fix a lot of your issues. Similar to the One Tamriel pass in ESO that normalized damage against all enemies. As for the other issues I haven‚Äôt experienced them so I can‚Äôt comment. If you really don‚Äôt like the game then it sounds like an easy decision for you though.
---
Odd I know so many people that still had 1000s in their broken stash around that time, hell I know two people that still have over 1 million weight in their stash with duped goods.
---
Cool, at least I‚Äôm not insane. I only really try to get one of the power plants for fusion cores. PA and Ultracite gatlings gotta eat.
---
Such an awesome base! Great location tbh. Also Is that the Grognaks Outfit?
---
Exactly this.
---
They weigh nothing. Each protectron vendor at whitesprings has one, the Whitesprings train station has two, and then each vendor at every other train station has one.
---
I‚Äôm terribly sorry that this happened to you. I‚Äôm a raider, but I don‚Äôt stoop that low. As a great mercenary once said, professionals have standards. And that guy ain‚Äôt a professional.
---
I came across a camp with 4 separate buildings, some were log cabins. Each one had not only the vault boy cardboard cutout pointing to them but one vendor in each building. They just wanted to get me to go everywhere and see their whole collection of junk crammed into each building. Dude, we don't care. We all have that crap too or have see it before. Keep it simple with the vendors. 
---
I hate seeing a massive house with vendors outside but when you go inside, nothing. Nothing in this giant 2 level house. The basic crafting stations, a bed, and yup, Fallout 1st scrapbox. Why is it the 1st members have such empty houses?
---
Sometimes even the clean up does as well, rare but I‚Äôve gotten a few. Almost have all those damned backpack mods (which are useless because I use a high capacity pack)
---
We‚Äôre you in your camp or at a workshop? Can‚Äôt use wallpapers in workshops for some reason.
---
I‚Äôm not sure.  I‚Äôm guessing it was just a typo, but it *was* humorously ironic.
---
I‚Äôll give my situation some context. I start college in September, at which point I won‚Äôt touch this game for months. I‚Äôm a fan of Fallout, but I‚Äôm on a time limit. And personally, I really don‚Äôt care about any of the rewards, except for the atoms and I guess the clean sink was kinda cool. Like I said, it‚Äôs just a suggestion. Chill out, bro.
---
Worth note, if you're a Herbavore, Cranberry Relish is a %10 Xp boost for a recipe where the hardest thing to get for it is the gourds, and Brain Fungus Soup gives +4 int.
---
Oh cool glad they're fixing stuff so I'll probably wait for that update but I do like the content which is why it's frustrating, I feel like the base game is holding back the wastelanders content imo but thanks for the details :)
---
I think they meant sale item. Like in the vendor.
---
Shut it both of you. Im the oldest and its mine!
---
From what I've seen they make up about 10% of the players under level 50, 25% of the players between level 50 and 200, and about 50% of the players above level 200.
---
 If you get set up with a set of UNY armor and all the right mutations and perks it's enjoyable and the power combined with the chance of death makes combat more hectic and enjoyable and you feel less like an invincible sponge hunter.
---
Back in the old days you‚Äôd login and you‚Äôd have to reload a weapon EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. It was so annoying
---
Dont forget to install mods for sprint and mutations and real time vats, fo4 feels so slow without them after fo76.
---
I'm going to try again tomorrow. Someone told me they think I need to solo it anyway
---
Im sure the whole "queen gets more buffs, the more people are there" thing has been disproved hasnt it?
---
Sure ive seen a few posts on this sub about it
---

Now if I could just find a bloodied handmade or assault rifle. All I‚Äôve been able to grind is a 1* instigating hand made and a 1 * instigating gauss.
---
Ok.  Thanks for the reply üëç
---
I‚Äôd like to, if the offer still stands.
---
Thanks yeah I've never seen a game with such varying opinions of it so thanks for yours :)
---
And make the perk card power user effect all types of cores. Not just fusion cores. That way you can double your ultracite cores and plasma cores
---
It would be totally cool if we could harvest glowing fugus and then plant them on corpses or meat piles. Some jerk comes to your camp and kills your brahmin? You could be slightly redeemed if you now had a source of fungus.
---
Would also be a lot of fun if we could plant corpse flowers, use them for attracting and farming ghouls.
---
Idk the orbital strike doesnt go through walls lol
---
You have to farm Yellowcake flux which is easy to do at a WS Nuke Zone.  Takes one vanilla plasma cores and one stable yellowcake flux to get three Ultracite Plasma Cores. It has been my SBQ weapon forever.  With three Lvl three heavy gunner cards, Lvl 3 Stabilized, Lvl 3 Bloody Mess and Psycho I get 49 hit points per shot, 500 shots per core.
---
Really? I dont get it though...i leveled up easily today and i started from maybe 500xp into my new level..finished Pt1 of the BP...you should be able to level up as quickly as i can
---
Thanks friend! It is, it is!
---
Yeah guess I can't really be too hard on Bethesda then, we all make mistakes ;)
---
The queen definitely gets stronger the more people, queen is so squishy when it's only 1 person there
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug. You can reload the server and it has a chance to fix it. When I get this bug while playing with friends I just reload from the main menu until I see them.
---
i am on xbox ! and maybe i‚Äôll do it idk i‚Äôm a bit anti social 
---
another thing what is an ‚Äúago‚Äù player ? idk if you misspelt it or it‚Äôs a term i haven‚Äôt heard
---
ive been playing fo76 since beta. i was one of the people who never got the collectors edition helmet OR the bag it was supposed to come in, despite ordering it. i was one of the people who was given the big ole "tough luck" auto response. 
---
i played from release till about feb of the next year.... so like 4 months. it took me 4 months to beat fo76, and by 500 hours the game was clearly a huge dumpster fire. 
---
the only saving grace of the game, was pvp with nonlegendaries. nobody had broken legendary armor/weapons(most of the broken weapons healed you instead of damaged you, so they didnt even fucking work), so most fights would last until one party ran out of stimpacks or their weapons broke. it was glorious. a fight with one person could last 15 minutes, not even joking.
---
then they started fixing shit, people started duping shit, and fo76 quickly became a mountain of shit. survival servers were great, but carebears couldnt handle pvp, hackers were hacking, and everyone had a duped godroll set of armor/weapons. survival got the axe. 
---
i just cant play this game anymore. the seasons, the fortnight gamemode, wastelanders shallowness... 
---
i expected more. i spent 3600 hours on fonv. 613 hours on fo76.  RIP.
---
Yes, if you know the mod plans.
---
So cute! That is the only prize I'm looking forward to
---
I use the refrigerated backpack now. I switch to high capacity if I need to. I try to dump shit I don't need. I just didn't know about the gold bullion mod.
---
As far as perks go, I only really roam around with the combat related perks.
---
Regardless, more enemies do spawn with more people. I did the Queen with just one friend on a private server, and almost nothing spawned at all.
---
Is your private world set to 'All Friends' or 'Team Only'? It is at the bottom of the screen where you choose to play on your private world.
---
Not to mention that killing the queen is also the final quest for the main story.
---
Pace yourself. We have like 2 more months of this challenge.
---
More enemies are good for xp, especially with the repeatable 10k
---
Do weapons for 2* and armor for 3* IF!! you want to roll a couple times.
---
I rather enjoy the feel of Fallout 4 without mutation's, feels more "realistic" having to use a Jetpack to jump 20 feet in the air as opposed to a mutation.
---
I would learn it. Those who regularly use the gun will have a 3star legendary anyway and won't need the plan. You would have to label cheap to sell it. Better off learning the schematics, then maybe craft a lower level version and see if it sells. You may be able to make some caps out of selling the guns and invest it in a plan / legendary you really want.
---
All friends is visible
---
Yus
---
Honestly, I think a carry weight perk for PA is needed.
---
Yeah, it was auto correct from aggro
---
That‚Äôs a wise outlook.
---
Yeah, its like in WoW, some person wants a PvP rank, but dont want to grind for it. And they are cosmetics for sure (except lunch boxes, i think they will be in atom shop later and drops from bosses)
---
VE? And yeah, the dupers really take away from the value/feeling from acquiring items legitimately =/
---
And haven't been keeping up, what's happening Monday?
---
Thanks for the tip amigo üëå
---
"Alright great sesh! Bye guys!"  
---
*-logs in the next day-*  
---
You are overencumbered!  
---
:O
---
Or let them do what they want. Cannot remember the last time i failed a scorched earth event. Probably a year or so. Most of the time it doesn't last more than 5 minutes.
---
Just take a picture in photo mode with the vault ID frame.
---
Competitive incentive maybe? I mean, I‚Äôll cheer when I move past him üòÑ
---
I thought it was removed but I checked and it was never in this one. Odd.
---
I think they removed 3 songs but the only one I can confirm for certain is Swingin On a Star is gone, and I really miss it.
---
I dont see many caps being made off that. Spend 18k-ish for something i might be able to sell for 25000 at the most, and thats a big if. Not my type of sale
---
Correct, but you won‚Äôt have access to your own personal private world. You can still jump into friends if they allow you.
---
Line in the sand is so easy to let others get hits. Personally, I stand not in sneak, and shoot their leg with an instigating lever action. It cripples the leg, and they slowly walk up so others can hit them.
---
I picked up a B25P Fixer from mama mumbles yesterday. Would have preferred a BE, and really any other third perk but it's a fine gun to add to my collection
---
The reason the majority of the community can agree on for this is Bethesda wanted a play time tracker and this is what the came up with.
---
When you cancel you get to keep the box and take from it only. The ranger armor is an outfit, so it doesn't need to be repaired. You will also have no more access to your tent or private world
---
Same here.
---
I usually just leave the match if I‚Äôm downed, especially if my team is a bunch of randoms
---
Beautiful moment right there... Apallachia is awesome!
---
that‚Äôs not a bad one. Lots of ghouls rush you during the middle of it though, just a heads up.
---
I  was waiting for Dino and Carla to finish their conversation, listening to them talk about how they waited so long for each other.  I had just gotten the telescopic zoom mod for the camera so I decided to play with it while listening to their conversation.  It said press L1 to zoom. So I did, and lobbed a plasma grenade at their feet and murdered the lovebirds. Oops. I still don't know how the camera zoom works.

There is mods for fo4 Xbox i believe, im on PC so not sure

I saw a YouTube video where a guy tried it with a bike. He died.
---
Very, very true.
---
I love one violent night quest. It's been a favorite since beta. Prior to SCORE, people were relatively respectful.. everyone stayed indoors, camp the Juke, all shared. Now I experience what OP says, people leap frogging to the outdoors, killing everything as fast as they can.
---
Interestingly, though, I find myself in the latter position you described regarding radiation rumble. I'm not really worried about success, though anytime I do this event with a friend we at least get level 1. It's about hordes of ghouls, easy pickins', lots of XP with the right stacked buffs! 
---
I'm more of a share and care type stranger. As soon as more people start showing up to an event I switch to my Tesla or sub gun for tagging. I know that's how I'd like to be treated in the same situation!
---
Use a chemists workbench it‚Äôs in the smelting category, you will also need some acid.  Use the chemist and super duper perks for extra yield.
---
Edit:, chemist does not work with smelting, my bad on that one.
---
ah ok
---
I'd kill everyone on this forum to be able to carry one more desk fan.
---
They do work ok against sbq but that time delay on them is a huge problem. Experimented with them the other day and i could relatively easily freeze the queen with cryo grenades. But the floater freeze grenades take way too long to go off. By the time they go off the queens allready moved or taken to the skies.
---
alright ! thanks for the help :)
---
Only if the playerbase kicks off I believe.  Otherwise they won't at all.  
---
But even if they DO find the fix, what is betting for some reason it will break during season two again?
---
I always unload a clip or two on them just for the inconvenience.
---
Ok thanks. Where's a Chemist Workbench?
---
they datamined it, her hp stays the same and it "getting harder" is just a myth that just wont die

&amp;#x200B;
---
the mobs is a moot point, most groups will end up killing them before they get to far away from where they spawned
---
Calibrated Shocks already exist, though.
---
It creates a problem with group leaders being able to change the bonus as they see fit. But I like the idea!
---
Alot of the uny armor characters have 400+ carry capacity so the extra carry weight isn't worth the bonus int or event xp
---
I have a 3\* Instigating Gauss Shotgun and in VATS, exit Vats, re-VATS it one shots everything,,even at long range.
---
I‚Äôm surprised your events even worked, we had no ghoul spawns, at all, and all of us had every instrument playing! Bar was at half, never had the wendigo scream, screen change, nothing . 
---
I jumped multiple servers to try my hand at some more, 4 out of the 5 I tried, same issues. 1 finally worked after 2 hours.
---
You can craft it
---
Any weapon is good if you have fun with it.
---
Nope. He's unkillable to me (and my ally, and my turrets, etc.)
---
After you've completed then fully once it should unlock in yhr terminal.
---
This game isnt for you then
---
Yes yes yes !!!
---
Vampires explosive, moderately desirable for the non bloodied/junkies. 
---
And they let the dupe go over the weekend, I just meant the whole weekend is free for all since they won't be fixing it anytime before monday.
---
\&gt;  Know that the more players that show up the more buffs the SBQ 
---
 please know that this is untrue and needs to die.

---
\&gt;  more enemies spawn 
---
more enemies that get almost instantly killed by most groups at the queens,  i consider myself lucky if i can even tag the mirelurk queen and hermit crabs before they get destroyed.
---
I can solo the queen with a deathclaw gauntlet. When you kill her in 5 minutes with 8 lvl 5's and 2 players actually capable of facing the mobs they generate get back to me. It's about etiquette, not a dick measuring contest.
---
Those bastards, making me to go their store!
---
Hold up, rookie question, how do you heal the NPCs?
---
Never had that issue. Sometimes I cant use my crafting stuff so I kill the npc and use what I need to.
---
Yet a max strength player with full deep pocketed Unyielding armor, high capacity backpack and radicool can carry more.
---
It stopped working for me a couple weeks ago
---
I didn‚Äôt have a nuke card on me. Maybe that was why. Thank you!
---
If I pay almost 2k to start a event, I'll kill the imposter as fast as I can. I'm not waiting for 8 people to show up to in PA shooting the bombs
---
I wish I could map Colas to the stimpack button
---
Were you in a team?
---
I demand a full dissertation with addendums
---
If you down all 4 then they will all just die
---
I'm with you there. The least they could do is get their 1k damage or whatever then kill the mobs. If there is only a few minutes left before it fails by all means melt her in 20 seconds like everyone says they can lol
---
Sure if YOU start it I might be more agreeable. But when someone else does it? 5 minutes. Gimme 5 damn minutes at least. Hell give us all 5 minutes
---
Honestly they most of them are pretty fun! Treat them
---
Like normal side quests and do them all once 
---
Event wise you should try all public events, they are all fun! 
---
Dailies:

Exactly this. Same with the queen, really. It‚Äôs my nuke why you‚Äôre here. I just invited everyone to join.
---
There are FO4 mods on Xbox One, but nothing for 76, and I doubt there ever will be
---
Friendly fire perk in charisma and a fire weapon. Best thing to use is a shishkebab. You basically hit them and they start to regen health. Even one point in it decent.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
were you on a team/public team? 
---
iirc, i think as long as you are "within range" of  a teammate who tags/kills it you get loot from the corpse,  although in my experience it has been a lot more consistent now than in the past.
---
rad rumble on a public team if i take C/D for defence and a teammate takes A/B i normally can loot that side
---
k
---
Really? I‚Äôm a bloodied build and everything but my chest piece is uny and like I said mine caps at like 350
---
Ahh yeah thats the post i saw.

Thanks for the link, saved for later reading
---
"Some reason" üòÇ
---
Lol
---
Tbh the radiation rumble one I‚Äôve only done twice and I‚Äôm level 101 and I didnt know till the end of failing the second one I did that you had to get ore because I wasn‚Äôt paying attention lol oops I just don‚Äôt pay attention I just shoot stuff
---
This is irrelevant when 8/10 people there are under level 10 like I'm referring to. They can't do anything to any enemies there. It's hard to kill the queen when you're constantly dealing with the enemies swarming you cause the low levels died or ran.
---
In addition to the locations people mentioned on this thread, I get a small amount every so often from my junk extractor and collectron at my camp. It‚Äôs not much but now that I have a full set of SS armor I don‚Äôt need it as much.
---
No?
---
Wow that's pretty edgy.
---
You would have enjoyed it when the game first came out
---
Thank you. 
---
What can I do with the box after I cancel? I‚Äôve gathered that placed ones remain but new ones cannot be placed, and I can remove but not deposit. I‚Äôm assuming the best idea is to place one as permanently as possible with 400 weight of my least used materials.
---
Does this include blueprints? (Can I include a scrapbox in a bp base and still place that?)
---
Thanks
---
I kinda wish you could only change perks at C.A.M.P. or something. Being able to change them on the fly seems kind of counter intuitive to the whole system.
---
If people are doing their own run they can do the nuke wherever or however they want or kill the imposter however fast they want I don‚Äôt care
---
the faster you kill the queen the faster you can get another one. are you still doing one nuke at a time? threatening people isn't going to help you
---
Honestly, what‚Äôs the point of killing the queen fast? Literally just to do another one? Does that make sense?
---
I have a Razer Naga and have them on my favorites wheel. I can activate any favorite slot with my thumb
---
I'm loving it, just clocked in over 80 hours. Still so much left to do...
---
Private server ?

exp baby plans loot mats
---
So, I was having this problem too. I did a bit of research and found out that a large part was my inventory. The game strokes out trying to load and manage everything you're carrying. The solution? Ditch your notes and holotapes. Go through both of those tabs, drop everything that's not important or neat to you, then sign back in. I can craft again without the game taking 15 seconds between inputs, I can use my weapon wheel again, I can load into congested areas without everything feeling like molasses.
---
Thin your inventory, it helps, a lot
---
There is a set of free plans at Morgantown station on the floor near a chemistry workbench.    There is also one in Morgantown airport in the hanger farthest from the train station.
---
I know I get the plan part sort of. I‚Äôm just venting it‚Äôs nothing personal. But you get more experience killing all the creatures overtime that she summons. By the time your running the silo again in the amount of time you killed it you probably could have gotten way more exp and drops from the mobs she keeps spawning. And I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt like it when I nuke the whole area. It‚Äôs funner that way imo
---
yes. they are irrelevant when any "queen ready player" should be able to handle the mobs, don't just sit there and w+m1, sweep the trash when the queen takes off/is flying, kill the mobs quickly and fire at the queen again, get somewhere where the trash cant hit you but you keep LoS on the queen.  there is a number of things that can be done.  remember, you only need 1% / 1k-1.5k to get event credit, who cares if you only did 4% of the queens hp instead of 6%.
---
dont put your failure's off on other people, there is more than crouch w+m1 in this game
---
edit: i saw in another comment you are melee (DCG) there is no excuse not to sweep the trash when the queen is airborne
---
Call it Frequent Flyer.
---
I believe you will find real women ( not the guys playing as women)  playing this game. It‚Äôs a great community and I know my daughter plays it.
---
https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-microtransaction-spending-explained-study-research/
---
&gt;‚Ä¶an increase in spending frequency will impact how Fortnite players see themselves. The notion of reducing the time spent playing Fortnite, for example, will diminish their sense of self-worth. Hence, such in-game monetization schemes, come around to convince players that they must keep playing and spending to be considered relevant among their peers
---
Still applies.
---
Id say even non legendary plasma Gatling are the best starter heavy weapon in terms of damage, for fresh characters. It outperforms any non legendary heavy guns during sbq (i have 5 characters, i know this for sure lol). Since you need to do atleast 1k dmg to get sbq loot
---
I play solo, so I can't help out much, but I know there are a lot of girls who play. The ones I know tend to be low down since they don't want to deal with the assholes and incels who ruin everything.
---
Or it gives players not yet ready, or not in the mood, a chance to get away and fight another day.
---
since when do we pin info that is false?
---
we cant even get useful stuff pinned anyway
---
I run bloody on 3 characters (melee, commando and heavy) the lowest carry weight I have is 395 (the commando) but I guess I am buffing that with radicool perk card for extra str,  you can add herd mentality to get an extra bit of str there too since it works even if you are solo in a public group (haven't done that yet on commando char) but I suppose it can vary alot depending on extra str from perks/mutations (I would suggest carnivore mutation mixed with strange in numbers then eat pepperoni rolls and deathclaw steak for a massive temporary boost )
---
Oh so THAT‚ÄôS what that guy was doing at Project Paradise the other night. Thought for sure he was trying to be a clown and kill the friendly creatures. 
---
Gotta find myself a shishkebab now
---
I‚Äôm a girl, I play as a male character to avoid creepy/rude guys who are jerks to female players. I‚Äôm on Xbox if you want to play sometime
---
Yes there are women that play this game
---
the stashbox is only for junk. And it can hold an infinite amount. Well i assume it's infinite. 
---
I bought 1st for a month and i've spent a good chunk of the last 3 weeks gathering junk. If you have stuff to sell try trading for things like steel and lead and acid. Always a market for those.
---
I love Goat Legs. I run a chicken shit build that uses Aquaboy, Briefcase Sniffer, Goat Legs, etc and it's way more fun than just running and gunning to me. I like being the most dangerous game. Because if they can't kill me before I gather all my nuke cards I'm gonna drop one on the final circle.
---
I hate that it's labeled a chem, so the healing factor mutation makes diluted useless and the regulars horrendously hobbled
---
Why are people down voting the truth, Bethesda and their support team have become very anti consumer, locking all mention of this problem with no means of discussion,
---
All of the photo evidence was also valid as the gold star one is impossible to complete without the others!
---
\*Limb damage enters the chat\*
---
For the amount of mobs I've murdered, ammo would have been costly.  About 95% of my grinding was unarmed with a lovely 3\* deathclaw gauntlet.  Unfortunately getting right in the face of mobs contributed to a few deaths along the way, which erased my sleeping exp bonus and forced me to return to camp to jump back into bed.  But I guess you have to take the good with the bad.
---
Yeah. A few times i've been healing during an event and someone has ran up and started hitting me and then you can see them looking at me and then the npc. 
---
You can just use a crafted one. but if you're gonna carry it you may as well get a legendary one =0 maybe one with reduced weight. even though it only weighs like 3 or something. 
---
Are you on xbone?
---
What platform are you on?
---
Big metal bois
---
Just take off your unyielding gear first.
---
It doesn't hold blueprints. If you have it for one month, store anything and everything junk-wise. Go hard on gathering random items to put in it, even things you may not need the components from. Not sure about the base thing
---
thank you so much

nice, thanks. i got this one that adds tags to items as well

My character has 485 carry weight right now. Let me tell you, as a non Fallout 1st player it feels like a huge flex.

I would love even more room though. I want to look like one of those caravan brahmin.

Damn I'm on xbox. But there is a girls fallout group on Facebook and you'd find a bunch of women players.
---
do guys actually do that over a game? i‚Äôm a female playing a female character and i‚Äôve never had anything like that. i don‚Äôt use voice chat so that might have something to do with it.
---
This would be so nice for new characters and people who picked up one too many weapons to scrap.
---
I‚Äôve personally never played the game with a girl, or heard any girls over the area voice chat, but obviously both men and women play it.
---
Thank you!
---
I play on the ps4. And I met a woman there. Really shy and all. But little by little we decided to team up and I would be her ‚Äúbodyguard‚Äù because she was a food build And didn‚Äôt do much damage. She mostly only played to build her camp, hunt and cook, and she made it all the way to level 80. Without doing any missions past the fire breathers. Fast forward a year and a half later. I introduced her to my gf, and they got along great. And now we mostly play every single day. Our friendship got so close that we added each other on fb and Instagram. And whenever we aren‚Äôt playing, we text and trade memes. Her husband knows about my gf and I, and he‚Äôs happy that we play together. If you‚Äôre on PS4. And you‚Äôd like to play with more people, feel free to message me. My gf and our friend Sue are friendly. Easy to talk to. And would be more than happy to help you rank up, and help you out with gear.
---
I'm a girl and I play a lot and have a girl squad I play with. Are you on PS4?
---
I have friends that try to evade and outlive everyone while being pacifist to players

Check out the Nuka gals! they are a girls only group but that also accepts LGBTQ+ members.

Silly OP,
---
Girls don't exist in real life. They were invented by corporations to sell Axe deodorant.
---
/s
---
This is a good point. If the group bonus was changed it could create frustration.
---
Absolutely garbage development team.
---
It's a shame, as the base game is fun, but Ferret et al are godawful, and Bethesda is as bad for enabling them.
---
Yes, there's duping. And unlimited caps. And vendors shut down for months. And perks that have been broken since launch.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you just have to do a certain amount of damage to a legendary enemy in order to collect loot. You don‚Äôt have to be the one to kill it. How do you think everyone who does SBQ events walks away with something?
---
Even better for me, a lot of free kills
---
And not sure about the one nuke at a time part, I‚Äôll run all 3 of them using the glitch and server hop sometimes but I tell ya it makes me not want to do nukes anymore if I‚Äôm spending the time the short way or long way and then the event is over in under 2 minutes. So I‚Äôm spending more time doing the silo run itself then playing in the nuke zone.
---
First time I did RR this week was nice with everyone doing enough work to get up to rank 3. Second time was failure because the people involved had no idea what they were doing. Third time I was the only one collecting ore and made it to rank 1. I will say that it is at least enough for me to knock out the daily level up for SCORE so its not a total loss.
---
I play solo but I never use my mic
---
I hear ya about the leveling!  I'm suddenly leveling faster now than ever before, despite being much higher level.  I think the buff to Carnivore and Herbivore giving double bonuses to exp foods contributes heavily to that.  Well, that and the fact I never really took exp grinding seriously before now because levels were kind of meaningless before.  
---
I was around 160-ish when the legendary run dropped, two weeks later and I'm just over 310.

if you use a flamer you have to bash them to heal them. Bonkers!
---
Some do. I don‚Äôt use a mic 99.9% of the time for that reason, plus I‚Äôm just more of a solo player anyway usually
---
What about the guys who play a female character for the

God I hate men. Source: am one
---
So glad I‚Äôm not the only one who gets all antsy playing NW. 
---
will I get a weapon? will I last long enough to get what I need for my daily? Etc 
---
I generally avoid PVP for that very reason but I need that SCORE (and the final Halloween reward)
---
It does, but the adrenaline perk currently doesnt work since the update.  But when they patch it it should go back to nornal.
---
LOL
---
To answer your question he likes it when you ask for his caps and gives you some addictol jesting that the buffout is getting to your head. He then adds that if you try to take his caps by force "you and his blade will get really well acquainted"  
---
I would like having him as an ally as well. Being able to have more NPCs in your settlement as well, or travelling merchants and other random characters that stop by them to add more life
---
What happens if you kill allies or named characters by the way? Or are they protected? I always kill settlers for a bit of xp but i haven't tried allies because I dont want them to dissappear
---
when youre doing the silo and queen event like for the 100th time u just gonna use every possible way to finish it quicker and quicker, its just mindless grind and almost the only one during end game grind. Also if u enjoy repeating over and over again queen fight without "magic weapons" when shes flying around 13mins and landing for total of 30sec , then I guess youre special. Also those mobs what she ll spawn like 2 or 3times per 15mins are absolutely not worth it
---
I have a female character so I‚Äôm not just a bunch of dudes, my main is a dude tho.
---
Lmao
---
I mean, yeah.  What they said
---
I bet you have shelves full of axe deodorant
---
Yes! I am on PS4 !
---
I‚Äôm even past that. I‚Äôm at the point now where I do the whole damn run as slow as possible and pick up every single thing In The silo just to change up the monotony and it‚Äôs impossible to be certain if I‚Äôm getting screwed out of the queen anyway . Either way you‚Äôre spending time playing the game. Do you really want to spend more time doing the mundane tasks or do you wanna extend the funnest part of the game, the queen (arguably) for little longer than 5 minutes.
---
i don‚Äôt even own a mic so i can‚Äôt exactly use one but i imagine some guys would get really creepy
---
in  2020, they are
---
Girls don‚Äôt talk on the area voice chat because of how guys react üò≠ so so lame
---
Every time I log in for the first time of the day I always hold my breath until my challenges load.  Thankfully the autocomplete bug only happened to me once but I lost like 750 score.  I believe it was like the second day, too.  
---
I vowed to make that score up with exp grinding, and then I kind of just never stopped.
---
AFAIK, the game pulls from your stash before your scrap box, so you can definitely hoard junk and sit on it for awhile after you cancel.
---
Happened to me for the first time today. Finally had a whole morning to work on my daily‚Äôs and was so disappointed I just turned the Xbox off.
---
Oh damn, that sounds cool!  This tree would look great in a graveyard camp
---
Also if you are doing RR do not put ore in until the end.  Every 25 r so it creates a new wave of harder enemies.
---
Wow it's been like 6+ months have they really not fixed that!? Jesus fucking Christ man. I new I got out while the getting was good.
---
Plus we are all special if we are playing this lmao
---
how about I ll grind the 3nukes + queens under 1h and then im gonna enjoy another game? that "legendary MMO best boss fight" prob is the only thing that keep players(grinders mostly) at the game, theres literally nothing to do when everything else is timeLocked
---
To bad you have no pull and this would serve less purpose then a blind man with a wife subbing to an only fans
---
Or people who upgraded hardware and want keep playing. I had Skyrim, Fallout 3, and NV on Xbox 360. When that died, I was happy to buy the three on PC when they were on sale on Steam
---
How often do you get killed by players?
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm not at all a fan of NE but I like the cosmetics from events that require me to go to NW. it‚Äôs a terrible system because I understand why people would want to kill me, but sometimes I just wish they‚Äôd wait until I found that creature to kill or the lock to unpick and then I‚Äôd gladly give myself up. In fact, I usually do once I‚Äôve achieved the goal. I just walk down the middle of the road emoting a ‚Äúcome and get me‚Äù emote.
---
I feel like the tree is a mark of passage.  It's half way through this slog.
---
As of the last few days there has been a wave of dupes going on.  That lags servers significantly.  Beyond that lots of people are opening many presents which also creates lag.  That‚Äôs why your load screens are twice as long now.
---
The time lock is there to slow down the nuke fights anyway. So that‚Äôs a good point. Your getting even less play time in the queen fights doing them too fast because you have to wait out the time anyway. Idk just personal preference .
---
Just a fun discussion?
---
I find it a bit easier when the deathclaws turn up. They cannot get to some of the scavengers
---
Most of the community will never be happy. Play on a private server and problem solved.
---
yes &lt;3
---
It's a shame that the terminal has such potential but it just falls way short. It wouldn't even take much to implement the other dailies into it. Hopefully they change this soon
---
I like the.... Spaaaaaarklessssssss

I remember two days ago I was in a random public team with a level 18 in it. I don‚Äôt know exactly why but he kept following me around Foundation smacking me with his multi-purpose axe. He had a mic but I didn‚Äôt know what he was saying due to me being in an Xbox party. I‚Äôm level 140 but I was still was anxious af
---
&gt; you could get banned for quitting while downed
---
That's the stupidest thing I've read all day. Thank god NW isn't that asinine. If someone alt f4ed and I lost the 20 xp for killing them I could care less honestly. Surviving a long time and reaching the final 10 is where the real XP is.
---
I loved Fasnacht version too.... Until five minutes later... SUGARY TREATS OF DELIGHT..... He's arguably worse than Sofia....
---
Mmos are a grind
---
I need this for all the times I accidentally walk off a cliff.
---
I love Fasnacht, I hate the collectron. They need a quiet option for all collectrons. 
---
Forager got booted the moment he opened his trap, Wanderer was evicted after not putting that guitar down. Raider Punk....I had him for so long.. How...now...brown...cow....
---
Then I found Beckett &amp; I'm pretty happy.
---
How about a cruel-nival
---
i had this problem fora while too, on ps4.  just about everything was "normal" levels, as soon as it was supposed to be a boss, it was absurdly high.
---
it was maddening going though a quest like it was stealing candy from babies, and then hitting a single enemy i could barely scratch.
---
You okay man?
---
What the hell am I going to do with the 750wt of bubble gum I have in my stash, for the chew 5 pieces of gum challenge?
---
you know. people give the allies a lot of grief but every time raider punk does his voice warm up it cracks me up.
---
It wasn't about the xp, it was about the loot. Grab as much high teir stuff as you can, which was harder to find in bf5, then quit while your downed, you just screwed over the team that just killed you. No heals, no ammo, no new guns, no gadgets. Most brs disable the menu while you are downed
---
Primarily because of stealth.  When you are hidden, people can't shoot you.  If they can't shoot you, you don't need health.  For this build, stealth is your defense, entirely.  The bow is completely silent (using standard arrows), so it's rare anything detects you.  Also, I'd say the "dump" stat these days is Intelligence.  IE, when you have extra SPECIAL points left, dump them into INT.  The XP boost is significant since the latest patch.  Good luck.
---
Just had a 30-second SBQ fight. Lots of level 300+ players (me included), so it was a race to get some damage in before she was killed
---
Its Fike103 tomorrow is good thank you

Mothman Sacrifice. Round up all the puny so-called Mothman Cultists and sacrifice them to Mothy in the shadow of Silver Bridge. Praise Him!

if you set it to proletariat it actually finds beneficial food like gut shroom soup which is +5% exp (+10% with herbivore)
---
&gt; It's a shame that the terminal has such potential but it just falls way short.
---
So true. I ended up scrapping mine for extra budget and just use one in someone elses camp to take the Biv quest while shopping.
---
people say it a lot but this is probably the best gaming community i've been part of. 
---
Yes. There are some wankers but that's to be expected.
---
I know one of the deals backed out for 76 which was weird because they agreed for the other games. I don‚Äôt remember which one but I remember it being a concern around the Beta
---
Most likely would be cheaper to just buy your spaces on the board. I would honestly just do that, I plan on doing that as soon as the option is available
---
At this point my character is basically bonded to the inside of his PA. It's instant every time for me man.
---
It's like they're waiting for you to call them an uber so they can get home and tell everyone how they saved themselves.
---
Ive had the opposite. I rarely see bloodies in public teams
---
The Brahmin herd one (forgot the name) is different lol.  The challenge is keeping them all alive
---
cool thanx
---
So true. I just skip the event now. It's terrible.
---
My hands get shaky and my aim becomes trash. Needless to say I‚Äôm only over rank 100 because of bush camping lol
---
Seriously they missed a huge opportunity here. Getting to allied with both factions isn‚Äôt really that worth it. You just get the plans you want from one then max out the other because one of them clearly has better stuff. Not to mention you just spend everything else on the Secret Service.
---
They wouldn‚Äôt even have to update the menus as all of them refer to free fast travel as ‚Äúallied CAMPs and settlements‚Äù
---
I never intended to be a bloodied build; It just kinda happened.
---
I wanted to be a sneaky sniper and not a tank so I didn't use power armor. I was always over encumbered so I gathered up a set of Unyielding armor for the strength bonus. I realized that being sneaky meant I seldom got hit so I really didn't need the hit points. Then I happened to pick up a bloodied handmade from a Scorchbeast and all the pics feel into place. 
---
I didn't choose the bloodied life, the bloodied life chose me.
---
Great story. That‚Äôs what the game is about. This awesome community.
---
Well thank god for your opinion
---
What about a mothman sacrifice
---
Why thank us and not him directly? I‚Äôll never get these posts.
---
I would love to see more of the Ash Heap, id reckon wastes like that extend into Kentucky. So about South-Westish. I feel the overall vibe of these two states is very similar, so it could very much work out
---
They're worth a ton, the plans, though I can't speak to buying more than one from the vendor. I've unlocked all of em myself. 
---
Refrigerator mod is great though, I had cooked squirrel from fasnacht until last night (though admittedly working as much as I do during summer, it may be moot).
---
Unfortunately, Chemist doesn't work for smelting. :( Super Duper does, though!
---
It's actually 2 regular plasma cores to craft ultracite. It does give you 3 ultracite cores with ammosmith on. Additionally, one thing to know with the explosive plasmas is that splash damage is way more powerful than direct shots. Try shooting the ground underneath her when she lands and you'll see your damage rise by about 2-3 times what it was before.
---
I've found it helps if you plant on individual tiles, then snap them together.  Then you can add fences around it or walls or whatever
---
Calibrated shocks need to be twice as much as they currently are to be more advantageous than a strength-built character with unyielding armor
---
Wanna buy some Berry Mentats?
---
Need some sights tho, badly, and silencer
---
It could just be on radios in a certain area or something idk
---
I always go for the ore in Radiation Rumble since usually no one else does.   I've failed that even so many times just because people don't pay attention to the objectives at all.    last night i failed a radiation rumble because literally everyone left the main room to chase a legendary down one of the hallways leaving glowing ones to come in from the front and flood into the room and kill all the NPCS.
---
That would be cool and we could have a Mole people city to invade as a dungeon or something similar. They have to be living somewhere.
---
I was wondering why every on the team I joined earlier had like no health. Makes sense
---
Yeah i mean its cool he got it but I literally stayed up all night to get the skeleton cause I decided last moment I wanted it to bad to miss out.
---
They'd do 'find more junk/ammo' before even thinking of doing the carry weight
---
I said this in another comment and was downvoted.  I go to work all day and come home to more work in the game.  Not to mention there is no variety in the events.  Every day, same few options.  I look at the prizes and think "that would be neat" but really its meaningless skins and and other things I'll forget about when the next one drops.  It's hard to realize that gaming doesn't have much to offer anymore since it was something that's always been in my life.  It's like ending a relationship.  I suppose I should pick up some tangible hobbies with real life rewards.
---
I have been having this issue off and on with all weapon types. Not sure what the fix is, it just randomly starts working when I load into a server sometimes. I've tried closing out and reopening the app, but have not been able to get them to work consistently.
---
Same here. Played a lot of online games...almost everyone ive come across has been willing and eager to help.
---
ive done my fair share...free legendaries to lower players...fixing their gear, modding it, free xp AID, helping others complete quests
---
Just the other day i guided 2 level 100 players who had never done Irrational Fear.
---
Compare to Overwatch (which i also love)
---
and you get screamers, you suck, you dont know how to play (this is in Diamond Comp)
---
etc
---
Games got its issues but the players
---
Solid.
---
Who do we need to spam tweet this @ to make this happen?!
---
I'd like to see a snowy area.
---
Also a big ruined city.  The Pitt and the Capital Wastland are both right next door so maybe eventually if they decide to milk the nostalgia bucks.
---
I had to stop playing fortnite because I would smoke a whole pack of ciggys playing for 2 hours it stressed me out so much.  I've tried to avoid NW for this reason.
---
It's harder than you'd think...though they're not particularly good at it anyway.
---
They don't seem to have the tools to track duped items (though I could be wrong there), and they don't have the experience with the engine to really fix the issue once and for all.
---
That said, there is an ongoing ban wave, so maybe they're starting to get the hang of at least part of it.
---
Love this idea!
---
What non-bloodied alternative did they remove?
---
I agree with you. I was full on stealth unyielding bloodied unarmed for ages and died very infrequently. But the the first Meat Week happened and I found myself dying too often because the Primal Cuts events 100% breaks stealth no matter what, as far as I could tell. So I ended up switching to a non-stealth in-you-face Junkie's unarmed build using bolstering armor as insurance if my health starts dropping while mobbing.
---
Now I mostly do Bloodied or Junkie's Heavy Gunner in PA but I'll switch to one or two handed melee for killing all the ghouls in one hit. However if I encounter a tankier enemy (Sheepsquatch, Legendary Scorchbeast, Imposter Sheepsquach, or Wendigo Colossus) I usually whip out a Junkie's faster firerate heavy weapon to taken them down more quickly.
---
Right now, because of the legendary run, I'll probably optimize a non-stealth unyielding bloodied DPS/Tank build using heavy weapons and get in PA for nuke zones such as nuked Whitespring and when finding/fighting the Wendigo Colossos.
---

Over the course of my wanderings I've bumped into women with fair frequency.

Guys are still more common, by and large, but yeah, I'd say there's a good number of women poking around West Viriginia.

When I visit a camp that I like I leave them 1 sugar and 1 spice.

My wife straight up said "fuck this grinding shit-- im done. Its not fun, at all." a few minutes ago before i logged into reddit. Bethesda better have something else up their sleeves because [SEASONS.AINT.IT](https://SEASONS.AINT.IT).
---
If you're on PC I have over 100 each of salt, pepper, sugar and spices I hoard for no reason other then to stack them. Selling them for 4-5 caps each. Let me know.
---
I run bladed knuckles, it backs a decent punch and doesn't block half my screen.

Upvote for spelling Encryptid correctly.
---
How does this violate rule 10
---
Meat Weak causing me to try switching from Bloodied to Junkie's.

Project purity?
---
I think many new players haven't caught onto the standards we have sort of socially established over the past year or so with tag and hang back. If people get on mic, say it on social media they can get the flow.

But he's I'm all about the xp right now
---
Lol ty
---
Yes, but they are actively fighting to manipulate you to feel like you can't, maybe you can just shut that out maybe you can't.
---
Meh
---
I've got a full time job and depression also, but I enjoy the grind. It's calming.
---
Building team for that. +4 intelligence = more overall XP
---
I said it a hundered times and I'll say it again: 
---
Capital Wasteland. 
---
I just wanna see what it looks like 25 years after the White House got gooped. 
---
I'd love to see The Pitt though, it was super underrated and arguably one of the best F3 DLC. 
---
I'd also like to see Point Lookout as well and dive more into the Dunwich story. 
---
I also could see BGS reusing the assets from F4 such as Boston, Far Harbor and Nuka World but I really don't think they'd do that. 
---
These are just places I wanna return to bc as a West Coaster, I don't know shit about the East Coast. 
---
I'm hoping that w Expeditions coming in Winter, we can leave Appalachia.
---
I run a bloodied stealth build that uses the bow.  I don't use VATS - only aim down sights (ADS).  It creates a slower paced game-play that I find an interesting change of pace compared to the usual VATS-bloodied builds that are out there.  Lots of fun.  While not a "meta" build, you will hold your own and do serious damage if you focus on head-shots.  The slower pace of play also allows you to use the "pacification" perks and get into the "natural" aspect of the build.  Here's the build:  [The Tribal Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f19be5&amp;d=a51ao0an2ar2lt2l71pv2pu2pt2pn2pe2a04sv0ir2ib4cu2cv2c02il2e00&amp;w=ic4p10pa0p80p90c52at1i11&amp;m=01c2fea&amp;n=The%20Tribal)
---
Yep I think people will start spreading this message and may just stay clear of bush people. It was hell previous to patch 20 on pc... Could be hiding and a hacker can take you out with a pipe pistol from half way across the map. It's gotten much easier to elude and hide now
---
We don't want people to leave!
---
I feel like we'd see the Pitt sooner just because we've seen so little of it in Fo3 that they'd have more artistic freedom.
---
Today I peeked in my inventory and discovered a mini bike launcher with this trait. No idea where I picked it up. Now I'm permanently spoiled.
---
When do you want to do it?
---
Don't use em.  The 5 min duration is too short, I'd always forget to use them or I'd run through my supply too fast.  It just didn't seem worth the trouble of stockpiling them.
---
  
---
Even when buffs only last 30 min it kind of irks me, I like ones that last an entire hour.
---
My bad, I meant Paradise. No idea why I thought it was Purity.
---
I did that mission at level 30 and I remember the assaultron and end bosses being complete jokes and I bursted it down super fast
---
I think Massachusetts and New England is a bit to far away to be able to walk there. Maybe good expedition locations. But both fo3 locations are right next door.
---
Check vendor bots around stations, they sell premade mods, which you can apply to armor or weapons without any perk cards, its helpfull when you doesn't have a plan or scrapped not enough items to learn mods you want
---
I haven't had the wherewithall to actually do a scientific comparison, but anecdotally, Lone Wanderer does not seem to work in a public team, even if you're the only member. I was leveraging the public teams for their base (no bonds) benefits when I noticed I felt a lot squishier. Once I dropped the team, that went away. 
---
I wouldn't discount it just being a placebo, but that's the way it's felt to me so far.
---
Why did they take out  Responder uniforms or Asylum outfits ?
---
Why of course!  At Riverside Manor, it's ALL girls over there.  Even the blocky, squarish types with deep voices that might kind of look like dudes wearing green and black striped dresses and veils... they're totally NOT dudes, and in fact are fellow she-women Mistresses of Mystery who are all part of the great sisterhood!
---
Yep, just us girls over here at Riverside Manor... come on by if you hate Raiders.
---
Or because pipe weapons are beginner weaponry, just a thought
---
Ah OK.. Seems easy enough! I reckon I'll prime it today, cheers!
---
Thanks for letting me know that, I was sure It did and of course when I checked it you are right, I guess I‚Äôm just in the habit of equipping chemist whenever I go to the bench lol.  Appreciate the info!
---
Do not like them. Bad enough that I have acrophobia, so, VERY UNCOMFY right off the bat, but too, TOO often, the person logs out and you fall to your death.
---
.
---
Not a fan.
---
My god imagine a bloodied tenderizer... jesus that would pack a punch
---
I'm not a level grinder, that's all. I have all of the god roll weapons from ammosmithing without ever duping a single thing. Not a ton of XP in that :)
---
Mine isn't an explosive, it's a Junkies 10% Aim Damage 90WR
---
I‚Äôm gonna play devils advocate and I know it will get me a ridiculous amount of hate (btw I agree with this thread somewhat but there‚Äôs two sides) but when I do uranium fever there‚Äôs a guy who one shots stuff just like me and they usually never tag so I rush to kill it so I get it and also one shot builds are yes op guns but also handcrafted with perks and armor to do it and not only that get fallout 1st and farm legendaries yourself
---
Lol, wow, I completely misread that. Disregard that portion then.
---
The only problem i would see is that someone leaving the team would cause you to be overencumbered so you get penalized when someone leaves which I don't like
---
If this is while using gatling type guns, it's due to having to wait until the barrel stops spinning before you can stim. 
---
Either way I agree, should stim when you press the button regardless.
---
Has someone helped you with that extra claw already? I've got the perk to apply it.
---
Lol nps
---
Same. I'm just logging on and casually doing the weeklies and dailies and then logging off. I see some posts from people who are marathon-ing the season via the 10,000 XP gain challenge and I'm just over here grinding out my 1-2 levels per day and enjoying it and taking my time. I figure that if I don't hit 100 I'd be close enough that a few atoms spent to close the gap wouldn't hurt, but I certainly aim to get as far as I can, just casually.
---
Just farming for karma probably. These post are always r/whogivesafuck material
---
I‚Äôm with it
---
I've tried NW starting yesterday. I was never interested in it at all, then I said what the heck, I want the SCORE. I actually enjoyed the 5 or 6 matches I've played so far.
---
Female here. Older gamer, too. I'm on ps4,  LoveIsAbusive.
---
I'm a girl. I play on PC as a female character and often use voice chat.
---
Have definitely run into some creeps but that's what blocking is for. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
yep. im a dude but in my countless hours of playing overwatch i can assure you, without fail, that if a girl started talking in chat there was a good chance that some cumlord on the team would instantly point out *‚Äùooooo a girl‚Äù* as if somehow she wasnt self aware. i actually used to make premade groups with a friend of mine and call the group ‚Äúegirls only‚Äù or some shit and just let her talk and see how much cringe we could stack up in a night, and lemme tell ya, it was *a lot*
---
ammos, assaultron recalk keycards
---
You know, that‚Äôs what I really like about it in the end, it‚Äôs a run and gun commando fun.  But I agree with you, silencer and sights would make it much more viable for most builds.  I don‚Äôt carry one anymore but it is a great for economy too, so much free ammo!
---
Bottom text üíû
---
It's different but it's not.   
---
If you press the Start button Or the other button opposite to it, you open the social Menu I think. Or the map, and the top left hand corner should list " "(button) Social." Open that. you should be able to flip between 4 tabs. the 3rd tab is the socail teams tab. I suggest depending on what you're doing, you either use the Builders (more INT means more exp) or the Events teams. Most team perks will work while solo in said social team.  
---
YOu play your style! You can avoid the Main story and side quests and just have fun, or you can complete them. You get guided through the map pretty decently if you do them though.   
---
As for the folks on Xbox, I can't comment much. I'm on PC, not everyone wants to talk. Then there's others who talk lots haha. All in game communication is either from the emote wheel or via mic. Check your settings, make sure They're set to who you're talking too. If you're in a group, it usually swaps to only in group chat on you then if set to AUTO. 
---
Hope this helps a little. BADcompanySarge and Juicehead have some good starter vids, as well as AngryTurtle. All have discord servers set up with seperate chats for consoles and such.
---
I made friends w another team's water camper on PS4 ages ago.. I gave him overdrive as a token of my friendship. We went from the dam to the river together. He was wearing the Free States Atom Shop Army uniform w the helmet. 
---
I miss him.
---
Wrong kind of overhang, man
---
This isn't a concern. Low level players don't effect the fight. And even though they can't kill the high level spawns, just by showing up you get XP for the event , 4 treasury notes, 4 pure flux. and a legendary piece or two of armor. 
---
The higher level players don't generally mind and find it amusing watching the low levels run around.  So you die, no big deal. Respawn, try to tag as many spawns as you can and survive to the end for the event rewards.Hell, you can even hide in the bunker or one of the 1st Tents on location. It's all good.
---
Not at all. It might be just a lack of playing pvp in general. The more you play the more you'll feel alright playing it.
---
Before this I had played tarkov, a hardcore pvp game. In there, you die, you lose what you brought into the match.
---
So when I came here with nothing to lose, I found it pretty simple. The only thing I dislike is the lack of sound; sometimes the bot is talking too much and it would help to hear if someone is running up on me.
---
If you wanna play some NW sometime, message me and we'll get some matches in :)
---
The duplication thing or something I'm not aware of?
---
This is the biggest gripe i have with the season thing. In RDR2 its just a fun way to get bonus throughout your normal gameplay, and with such a long timeframe to do it, that it works for both 24\\7 grinders (altough they like to complain its nothing to do after they burnt through it fast)  and casual players that dont have as much time to play.   
---
Meanwhile if you dont play everyday and grind out each thing you have no way to really do it all in this game, its not like its a 5 minute login bonus you can grab eveyrday, you literary have to play this all day and nothing else for the whole duration or you're fucked.
---
I just started to play the game a few days ago aswell.
---
I would say just play the game and don't look for advice how to play it. You can't really do anything wrong I feel like.
---
I'm just following the main quest, explore the areas and do quest where it sends me to. Plenty of side quests/events will pop up when you visit all the different places.
---
GothicBarbie25 is my tag. I'm fixing to go to bed but we are def gonna play together sometime. If you're up for it üñ§
---
On the flip-side, I love seeing the public teams and everyone working together to get faster S.C.O.R.E. progression, whether it be running events or getting +4 INT for a small XP boost. Stuff like this is what will really help the game going foward, especially with any future Raid/Operation content they release.

Wholesome

You guys notice the fix they made with Carry perks taking effect when you load, is what lead to the current dupe wave lol
---
I know the mothman already has an event but I would prefer a different event that's actually located near the mothman museum. And maybe higher spawn rates for the cryptids in the specific areas that they are supposed to inhabit in real life so more spawns of the flatwoods monster in flatwoods, More common to find a Grafton monster near Grafton ect.
---
It happens. Remember a 12 year old screaming at me he was gonna rape me back when I played Overwatch. Good times.

Me and my girl play on PS4, she's in a fb group as well called Nuka Girls... Or Nuka Gals... Something like that.  If she's cool with me giving out her psn I'll message it to you.  She's done a trade or 2 in that group before.

You see the Bloodeagle stuff that was datamined? Might work well with that idea

Thanks!!  Also found this YouTube Video That helps break it down:

Maybe change it to like 10 carry weight or 5 per person.
---
I have them in vending for 300, but I'm in NW atm.

Well, my workaround to these people since you will encounter them everywhere is to use a tesla rifle and also watch those spawns. Just tag them and let anyone else kill the creatures. I also don't enjoy this grind that we have to do everyday if you wanna level up more than one score level per day but the sooner we finish the better, so right now i will play along.
---
the map change was the hardest for me
---
I honestly feel bad for women who play video games and the things they go through, i dont know about 76 but in overwatch where theres a decent amount of female players and where the community is a lot more toxic, i hear a lot of men making them feel like absolute garbage and it makes my blood boil... i dont have a mic rn but when i get one im gonna flame the shit out of these toxic dumbasses
---
only on spaghetti code, that's the true of bethesda code.
---
The junkies bug is a glitch we‚Äôre certain weapons with the junkies effect on them if they fire fast enough they do crazy amounts of damage or way more than they should
---
I‚Äôm a girl and I play quite a bit. I‚Äôm level 43 or 44, but that‚Äôs not too much higher than you. We can run some quests sometime if you like?
---
Exactly. I only suggest bc its the same engine w some tweaks &amp; Bethesda loves their old assets. 
---
F3 is a 30 minute walk from Appalachia if we are on Bethesda Miles/Meters
---
As far as radiation rumble goes you prob need 75% of the players to protect the 4 essential workers. The min would be two players doing that and one in the middle to heal and handle the ghouls who make it through. The more people you have there the more you can get closer to 50 50 if defense has op guns
---
What the hell you talking about?  Dont is not a proper word (unless we are having a conversation about the card game bridge, and we are not).  
---
And neither one is possessive, it's called a contraction.
---
Nah, that'd make it an extra 100 carry weight for a full team. Public teams aren't meant to give that much of a bonus. I could see 10 or 15 per, but no higher.
---
How about that cover of the ring of fire? Don't you like it having a west virginian spice to it???
---
I‚Äôve played with quite a few women, but like most of my male friends in this game they‚Äôve moved on to other games and I don‚Äôt talk with them much anymore
---
lock down or away from the enemy is the only way I can use stims.
---
"We'll pass this onto the team"
---
I honestly would be happy with just that as a reward. They can keep their items
---
Its weird cos the mods of NV Miami an CA kinda put the kibosh on those parts.
---
NYC would be wild with all the buildings, subways, bridges but i dont think its doable (unless it was in Manhattan and DLCs were the other boros)
---
But i think theres nowhere else in America they could do.
---
It would be awesome to get Fallout:International
---
edit: thought you were talking about Fo5
---
If you got a spare set laying around, yeah. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt want anything duped. You can probably get one cheaper if you wait, assuming you don‚Äôt want it ASAP.
---
The thing is though it's not that hard, they're just running amateur hour. This is exactly where they were at with it months ago when I left. This is just sad, who the fuck makes an mmo without unique item Id tags in a game about collecting items. Fucking amateur hour.
---
I know I wanted to see if hed follow
---

---
Swam

---
Good idea, just would have to be +5 or +10 because 25 is a bit much
---
Or how about just *don't dupe?* Because, you know, it's cheating.
---
You have to add your friends to your friends list and they have to add you back, then you'll be able to jump to each others servers.
---
Bethesda client, game pass, steam are all on the same server. The only difference is that atoms/fallout 1st doesn't transfer between the three clients.
---
 Anything you buy with atoms or unlock through fallout 1st will be available across all three clients, just not the service itself or any atoms you earn, they're unique to the client you're playing on when you buy/earn them.
---
Finally a cool idea!
---
Also super easy if you got a legendary with armor penetration they surprisingly have low hp.
---
unyielding build, with deep pockets and high capacity backpack. I also have some weight reduction type on my armor.
---
are you sure they aren‚Äôt just being jerks and it has nothing to do with you being a female ? people say off putting things and i have weird interactions with people all the time. i just find it hard to imagine because I feel like there‚Äôs a good general census almost anywhere online these days that sexual harassment isn‚Äôt okay.
---
Are you living in a fantasy world? They reply to community feedback all the time, and multiple people have posted that Beth has refunded them score. OP is lying about what they said because it‚Äôs popular on this sub to hate Beth for some reasons.

You should read my [Radiation Rumble guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h0mg5g/the_complete_idiots_guide_to_radiation_rumble/), it's a real game changer.
---
That's like one desk fan...
---
You do die.
---
That's the only reason Junkie is considered a truly viable alternative.  You do less damage but you die way less.
---
Radiation is just a kick in the nuts if you aren't paying attention with a bloodied build.
---
Edit typo
---
Serendipity, dodgy, lone wanderer, nerd rage, and fireproof probably, and this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WV2PezWLaI
---
Likely more, but I haven't really seriously done a bloodied build.
---
I tried researching strangler armor before and I don't believe there is a way to make it (or mod it in your case) if you don't already know plan because it was a vault 96 thing and now that's closed.

Don‚Äôt mean to hijack or divert but what the hell weapon should I use if shotties suck?

I see level 100+ using mini guns (I think) and possibly the laser gatlings but I can‚Äôt really tell. I love my combat shotgun but if it‚Äôs underpowered I don‚Äôt know what to use. :(
---
The code change?  Sure maybe it's quick.  Then integrated test and qa and deployment and system testing and... I know I'm getting down voted but people here love to pretend they know.
---
honestly u die a good amount lol
---
I said that they (Bethesda) should be working on a new engine instead of repurposing this one for the next console generation and there were a significant amount of people who disagreed with me because the games would lose mod support. It baffles me that people would rather pay full price for a game riddles with bugs, inadequacies, and outdated mechanics simply because a modder can make it look pretty and Thomas the tank engine a dragon. They're so near-sighted that they can't even imagine what a new and improved engine would do for the capabilities of the modding community
---
Awesome, thanks for the info
---
Yeah but the other bonuses aren‚Äôt extreme like +8 charisma or +8 intelligence. So if you make one too good the others won‚Äôt get picked.
---
No I still need help plz
---
But 100 isn't even that good..?
---
I propose a nw game mode where the only armour available is a witches hat ( traffic cone) and the only weapons are wet mops. mandatory 3 drink minimum before entry to lobby.
---
It's really simple: if there are players going for the ghouls, I'll happily play the bass. If everyone's being a knob and doesn't know what to do, I kill ghouls.

Ya, one of my characters is built around using a JE gatplas. Super good weapon
---
Honestly a huge array of ppl who llay thid game
---
My camp consists of 4 vendors each with their own prototype generator because they're silent, then on the other side of the camp is one 2x2 building building with one silent generator to permanently keep the garage door open. Complete silence.
---
I don't "pretend" it's the true, if you don't keep it documented and separate by whatever was the rule it becomes spaghetti and a simple if becomes an indispensable function for the entire system to work, and I bet my left finger that is exactly like that all the unfixed bugs so far.
---
I am a heavy weapon PA build but I can transform to melee by switching perk cards and equipping melee weapons.  My favorites are my Instigating FSS Grognak's Axe and my Vampires Fss Bowie Knife.
---
Unfortunately armor can be duped too. But yes, if I were OP id only do it if it was a spare or if I really wanted that gun.
---
Okay, let me know when your back in the main world and i‚Äôll buy

Funny you say this because I only just found out that Quad only works on the base mag...was looking forward to having a 12 round broadsider lol

I honestly dont mind that. I cant stand any of the Ink Spots songs on the radio, though.

Slut , haha
---
Theres more than people think, my wife plays FO76 on PS4 more than I do now üòÇ  shes hooked.
---
I also have 4 characters, all have full sets of unyielding armor with deep pockets. With two backpacks each to swap. (fridge/capacity or armored/fridge). All legendary armors have some weight reduction. I don't have a carry problem. Just a stash one. Non-fallout first.
---
I rolled more than 20 before I got one i liked. Currently doing the same with the mini. Honestly it's kinda demoralizing, is what it is I suppose. Keep after it
---
It's not nearly as easy as you might think.  I did some dev work (WAYYYY back in the day), and it's easy to fix what you can see, but it's impossible (mostly) to fix what you don't see.  The best you can usually do is put in a good tracking system (76 doesn't have one, or not a good one), and have a good event tracking system (few games do, and 76 certainly doesn't).
---
It's impossible to predict what people can invent to get around the system, the best defense is tracking to pick up the pieces quickly after the fact.

Yeah I've been playing as a bush wookie just to avoid the majority of stress.  How long did it take for lvl 100?
---
I have a 495 carry weight with the right perks and legendary perks on armor and it helps a lot
---
While this could help people, I don't see how it is acceptable by Bethesda. I am excited to try the game out but I'm yet to find a solution to this ping issue
---
250 score for 3 legendaries doesnt seem worth it to me...
---
I found the sign and the vendor (which is awesome), but am unable to find other items, like the bar. - Help.

I mean, in about 5 minutes of playing ive usually already killed 1 or 2, not a hard task to accomplish?

silent generator where?who sells? do need some tipe of sacrifice to get it? I need that, and some quietly turrets.

He asking about good or not, how is it related

The thing about bloodied builds is you can spec 100% for heavy weapons and still one shot pretty much anything with bloodied rifles even without rifle damage perks.

My wife and I play together on PC .

This is what happens when you force people to enter a PvP mode to get rewards to use in Adventure mode.  I'm sure alot of people actually like NW but there are alot that just venture into for the rewards and don't really wanna be there or participate in it at all.

I am! Just poor right now!

I've done Violent Night about 3 times in the last couple of days. Each time it's me and only about 1 other person playing the instruments. By the time the Nightstalker shows up the ones actually playing the instruments don't even have time to get up before it's killed and we miss out on everything.

Hey there, i‚Äôm switching from Xbox to Pc and have a bunch of junk, guns, armor, caps, and ammo I don‚Äôt need. Hmu when ur up and i‚Äôll see if i‚Äôm on, there‚Äôll probably be some decent legendaries in there, also kindly don‚Äôt scrip the stuff I give because they are pretty decent and it would be best if you keep them. Enjoy the stuff!
---
That‚Äôs 1/3 of my carry weight now, and I have a high strength. +50 total would be more than enough. If you would make this a strength bonus like the other teams it would be +4 or 20 pounds.
---
I've never had it on ps4 and I'm usually running around in a nuka girl outfit
---
This is very good information
---
Its alright.  Not as good as a gun, but nice for stealth gameplay.  Arrow/terrain hit boxes can be wonky and vats is kinda jank as well.  Definitely bring a backup or a melee weapon because using it close range is painful.
---
Works great for me. Doing my fourth playthrough on Wastelanders quests.  My lowest level is catching up to the other 3.
---
Youd just let them win, proving it bothers you, take it like a champ
---
I think this would be the way the went, if they were to do it. With my excavator armor and mutations, I can carry 475wt. So in a group I‚Äôd be at 575, which I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt want to happen. But if it were 5-10wt per person, that‚Äôd be pretty reasonable I think. 
---
Definitely agree with OP‚Äôs suggestion for a new team variety.
---
You make sure to shoot first, but you'll always get that charred ghoul that instant transmissions behind you.
---
The public team bonuses kinda baffle me. Two of them seem like a good idea, one of them seems mildly useful (luck) and the other three are a waste of space. Maybe a team of unyielders will appreciate End +4 but I can't imagine a use for more Cha and Int. Instead of SPECIAL bonuses, we need better, tailor made bonuses, like this carry weight suggestion. They didn't release a Str group bonus on purpose, because Str is already heralded by everybody all the time. Carry weight avoids boosting Str while still giving people what they want. That being said, carry weight fluctuation at the rate I've seen groups and bonds change, no thank you. I'll stick with double legendary exp.     
---
As for more clever ideas, I thought Bandits and Lawkeepers would be good ideas. Bandits do increased damage to players and always show up hostile to other players, Lawkeepers get increased rewards for hunting bandits. Maybe liven up the damn PvP community a little bit.     
---
Hunter - Gatherers. 25% per person, chance to get double loot from gathering nodes of all kinds and animal parts.     
---
Mechanics. Increased damage in power armor. Maybe 5% per person. Or maybe increased AP in power armor, 5-10 per person.     
---
Hikers. Increased movespeed (plus fixing the non-stacking reload and movespeed buffs) out of power armor. Again, 5% per person.    
---
Friends. Close proximity required, like rad sponge. Increased exp gain for all things. 25% per person.
---
Smurf‚Äôs possibly

Try jet packing up to it. Get near it and try to collect.

No no my mistake, I wasn't disagreeing with you.  Youre totally correct.

Think everyone got what they wanted this week lol.
---
I've only played this event a small handful of times, and I've never even SEEN a Nightstalker. In fact, at first I thought the whole thing was a myth to make the story and lore more intriguing.
---
But no, it's actually just some asshole on the roof one-shotting it as soon as it spawns in.
---
They need to massively restrict the event area. Make it so that if you put one foot outside the barn, you get that "Leaving event" warning message. That would keep eveyone indoors where they're supposed to be.
---
What other ones are there I know instigating is glitched on lasers maybe even other weapons
---
No I use the excavator power armor with the leg mods that directly boosts your carrying capacity and then the torso mod that increases your strength. Sorry I don‚Äôt remember exactly what the mods are called.
---
I assume you also use the radicool perk for an extra boost?
---
If no one in the server is helping out, I'd just recommend switching servers until you find one with several active public teams. If you launch a nuke then, there's a decent chance that plenty of people will turn up for the event.
---
Ugh.  Just watch it before you judge it - it's a fun film.
---
I've tried and it always fails
---
ya i was running that yesterday with like 4 other people and im a melee build . every time i went up to an enemy and swung they would teleport like 5 feet away before my axe hit them... its so frustrating.
---
I'd think comparing FO76 to another Bethesda-related MMO is best here. So ESO.
---
ESO has no currency caps that I can think of. Want to earn gold or other currencies? Kill and sell for 24 hours straight, you won't hit a cap. Need your top-tier gear? Keep running the dungeons until you get it.
---
Edit: Undaunted keys have a cap. Forgot them.
---
Consider giving "No Man's Sky" a look, it's has similar themes and isn't yet ruined by new FOMO industry standard.

It's way worse when it's a guy with a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet. I've seen those things go for 1k damage. Plus since he was not in PA he might had a full assassin set or some stuff like that.

Tangentially related, there are [maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnpyno/mappalachia_now_with_maps_of_flux/) that show where flux can be found on the map when nuked.

Just so far. It gets easier. Just always remember, don‚Äôt stand on the survival tents.
---
I don't want another charging weapon *period* unless they fix them first. It's disgusting that all the end game weapons we've grinded for are utterly trash in VATS.
---
I ran a pistol build around release and it was crap, so when the gauss pistol came I thought, this is it! They've made it viable!
---
Nope. Now I'm using bows and they suck equally as much. Having long reload times on top of needing to charge a shot, then having charged shot after charged shot miss until you break stealth and get killed... Nothing else in game frustrates me this much.
---
Respeccing into melee is probably going to be the best decision I've made over hundreds of hours.

On my tank build. Not on my gunslinger, ghoul build or heavy weapons/ food build.

I thought it was my controller until I got a new one and it does the same thing, you have to spam the right d pad so many times until your character finally manages to heal himself. By far one of the most annoying bugs especially when you‚Äôre doing scorched earth and you‚Äôre spamming the d pad
---
I‚Äôd be stocking up on Treasury Notes then.

Awesome! I have geared up only level 50‚Äôs since i was and early bird, now i‚Äôm too excited to use my items.

Sure thing!

No I only started playing the game again about a month ago. I was still level 8 from when I got the game when it first came out. I reached level 20 about 2 weeks ago.

Alright. Somev time tomorrow?

I dont really see Fallout 76 as much of a grindy game since i play Destiny 2, but now that i think about it, yeah battle passes are really unoriginal and grindy in general
---
I just moved my camp up north too, wanted something quieter. Haven‚Äôt had any allies on this character yet. But it was too busy around top of the world and upkeep on my vendors. It‚Äôs nice to hear you are going to stop selling shitty plans lol I try my best not to either. Going from 3 machines to 2 this time. Just built the log cabin and planted some crops out back for brewing beer. Pretty peaceful up there just south of the raiders train station in the savage divide. Have only had the pop up that your camp didn‚Äôt spawn, once in the last two days too.
---
It's not a bad idea, no! I like it even, I probably came off a little harsh, but I really can't wrap my head around them making these the end game weapons, releasing them in this state, and not even acknowledging it.
---
If it was Fallout 4 I'd have thrown the gauss pistol on a display and never touch it again.
---
They said they're looking into making workshops permanently owned in private servers, that's why I think the bug happens where workshops don't show up as workshops and have regular fast travel icons even though you don't own them
---
Adding you rn my fellow Doctor Who fan
---
Pressing it 6 times and you accidentally used 3 stims
---
Or... they will continue to add more to provide opportunities to make the increasing score count needed each day. Too bad we have to speculate though...
---
You've been making arguments that unyielders won't even notice differences of less than +100 carry weight, and yet you think 4 matters when, depending on the build, unyielders are already at 20-30? And, if we're being honest, unless than plan on massively improving the suggested Legendary Perk cards, what does level matter for after the first couple hundred.     
---
Base special boosts are boring and uninspired. I thought, because you were suggesting carry weight and not Str, that you understood that.
---
One thing that has helped that I've seen once or twice is place a camp right by Drop Site V9. The player had a staircase going up 2 stories. First story had benches and such while the top floor was a giant platform covering the entire camp area. It was nice because the SBQ would land on the platform, though it could get messy since scorched spawn on the SBQ.
---
Keep trying. I'd typically join a group before launching or even try running a few events before doing so. I'd say the more tents set up down there, the more active the event will be.
---
I usually do

If u on ps4 u want it
---
You are correct about it being crossplay with Steam and Bnet but not Xbox console right now. But I do want to mention Xbox play anywhere isn't just for 1st party games. RE7 and Fallout Shelter are two 3rd party examples
---
While I rely on them too much, I wish for a game mode without them.
---
Honestly, it is a shame that legendaries have become The Thing people play for. We ought to be rewarded with opportunities for story and quest unlocks and opening of events, not a chance for a RNG roll that may reward you with a particular effect on a bit of gear. 
---
While I appreciate the chance to get gear that‚Äôs helped me in the game, it really is sad and I feel it lends to some issues with gameplay. Over-reliance (or exploitation) of certain effects leads to making enemies simply more bullet-spongy rather than more difficult through need for strategy. I feel the imposter sheepsquatch is the only boss that really needs any consideration for taking it out. When an effect becomes too powerful, they make damage resistance higher or completely negate certain forms of damage to make up for it. There‚Äôs no good reason for explosives to do so little damage, but it was a necessary change to deal with TSE damage output - and trying to address the effect took it too far in how it consequently nerfed grenades and rendered one of the more iconic Fallout weapons nearly useless. People used enforcer to reliably ground the SBQ so more damage could be inflicted once she lands, so they made her unable to be crippled rather than rebalancing damage output based on proximity for both crippling effect and damage from weapons as a whole. A sledgehammer or meat hook ought to do plenty of damage, but not more than a high powered rifle round or really any single bullet from a machine gun and they leaned into keeping melee a higher damage output since you take greater risk in getting up-close-and-personal and certainly have a lower rate of landing hits than an automatic weapon and that has gameplay repercussions. Still gets pretty silly when legendary effect damage multipliers get tacked onto it, and then high-damage melee specialists whinge when a flying enemy is out of range of their one-shot weapon.
---
I fully embrace legendary effects as I‚Äôm playing adventure (casual) mode, but if we had a real survival mode with no legendaries at all, rebalanced damage output and armor thresholds, and more dramatic repercussions for hunger/thirst/exhaustion/disease/radiation, I would actually risk PvP for the different experience.
---
Or you press it 5-6 times because nothing is happening, and two seconds later all of them go off and you've wasted 5 stimpacks.
---
More efficient for sure,  I just like the overkill xD. Maybe I‚Äôll lose interest but me be Gatling Plasma is what I need right now,  definitely makes me chuckle when I use it lol

I‚Äôm a sniper build and I never had much of a problem with damage from enemies, I just use the best armor possible with regeneration and stealth
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm on pc
---
There was someone who gave a SBQ fight this morning,  and even they didn't show!  I take my lvl 60 self and my rifles to deal with the scorched mobs.  Today, the queen was all over me.  Checked the map.  Just me and a lvl 20 were down there.   I noped out of that fight.  üòÜ
---
YES.    I would rather I get a message saying I got 5 script from killing a legendary instead of a 1* nocturnal lead pipe AGAIN.   Just make it so there is a vendor  where i can buy everything and let us play.   No limits on what you can earn from playing and no BS about weight limits so that you're screwed having to wait until the next day to turn stuff in.
---
Yeah, I know they don't do much damage as is. But i just enjoy being a bulky boi and smashing mutant heads in with sledge hammers.
---
Apparently right now carnivores can eat Mutfruit, Melons, Pumpkins, pumpkin pie, and cranberry relish.  ü§î
---
A couple days ago cranberry relish didn't work for me, but it does today.
---
You could try spamming honey to jetpack higher.
---
I got mine a couple hours ago so I assume so
---
That's awesome
---
Let it spawn in with a couple of different voice modules and styles like Emeril Lagasse, Guy Fieri or Gordon Ramsey.
---
Intelligence works best for me. Solo player, unyielding and the benefits of team boost without having spec for it. Everything I do gives me extra XP and if others on team turn in quests, free xp
---
Oh, and eggs seem to not be meat or vegetable.
---
Yea an event against the mothman where you fight him all over town would be fun and the grafton monster does spawn near helmlock holes which is pretty close to grafton I  think it's to make sure that the low levels aren't pummeled before getting the perfect storm or another decent legendary gun
---
I said what I said. During encryptid and most other events, they are slouched in a corner somewhere while non bloody builds do all the work.
---
I‚Äôve been working through some hard drive issues on my bf and I‚Äôd ps4 but I‚Äôd love to have more females to game with once it‚Äôs sorted out! (I‚Äôm lvl 56 btw)
---
There‚Äôs a certain level of admiration and sportsmanship to moments like these, one I don‚Äôt experience often because 99% of the time enemy players are attempting to kill me.
---
Sadly, I am on PS4 and don't get to do fancy things like that
---
You don‚Äôt fight it tho
---
You're a god damn genius, son
---
Yea I‚Äôm ‚Äúvegan‚Äù but can eat Salisbury steak
---
Most Battle Royale games do this. I've played PvP games for a long time and Battle Royale style does something.
---
I play Fortnite with my son and I can become a bit too much and have to quit.
---
I've gotten better and realize especially in NW time in the game is most valuable and hiding is very easy. I have also found a crew I go with who makes it a lot of fun (found them in game). Finding the right crew creates a nice energy. If you lose it's fine!
---
Don't give up on the game mode. Eventually you'll relax and be able to enjoy!
---
Hmm you can try a berserker or a vampire build, I sometimes use a vampire Chinese officer‚Äôs sword against the scorch queen
---
Well I ran an AFK script every night for maybe a month or so and got it. I can‚Äôt remember the exact amount of time; it‚Äôs been a while lol
---
Lifegiver 4, Serendipity 3, Dodgy 3, Nerd Rage 3, Blocker 3 and Fireproof 3.
---
I almost never die unless it is poison or me being a total dumbass.
---
*Lifegiver* is the most important one.  Minimum rank 3.  This means your build will need to have at least 6, preferably 7-8 endurance. (Radicool)  You can stand to lose a few weapon damage perks because bloodied is massively OP even without them.  Think Rank 1 or 2 of each Commando/Rifleman/Heavy card and use the leftover points to beef up your defense.
---
The key to lifegiver is knowing how it works.  You have to have the speed demon mutation, and when your health takes a hit you have to sprint momentarily.  Your health will jump back up to about 30-45 depending on what rank lifegiver you have.  Rank 3 jumps up to 30, rank 4 to 45.  It only takes an instant for it to proc. and your health is back to whatever your rads limit is or up to those numbers listed above.
---
Beats the hell out of spamming stims.  I hardly need them any more.
---
Credit to Angry Turtle for teaching me this.
---
Move your camp and build a latter. ü§î
---
I‚Äôve spent countless hours making different robot buddies. Hard to choose between a quick assaultatron  rushdown robot or a sentry/tank robot.
---
Age?
---
and the trees were all kept equal by hatchet.. axe... and.. saw....
---
Are the other players shooting at you, or shooting at the ground near you?  Shooting at the ground means "look here!  I dropped some loot for you!"  Then look for the paper bag.   Sometimes it is a tombstone or paratrooper bag.
---
I‚Äôm 20
---
I like that
---
Ah, so is being a tank pretty much worthless now? And I'll check out the beserker and vampire builds, ty :)
---
This. Reload server should work otherwise restart the game. Frustrating but it works.
---
Shotguns is best vs asaulttrons, just 1 perk point to enforcer and you good to go (shotguns shoot 8 pellets, so even 1 point is enough). Shoot to head to disable laser, shot to legs and they fall to the ground, use vats for it
---
Yeah. I hope they have a plan to add actual endgame content to the game. I didn't mind it before when it was chill. But now I'm being forced to do certain content for an hour+ or being forced to do NW. I've really started looking at the SCORE board and thinking to myself "Do I really care about this or will I end up just buying something in the atom store and will mainly just use that". The only main thing I'm looking forward too that is furthest in line is the Chicken Coop. MAYBE The secret door. I'm on the fence on the secret door because there's only one building set that it will fit with and look good with, the contemporary housing bundle stuff. Everything else it just looks out of place. Chicken coop is cool, but I may also be fine with doing that without. Fertilize isn't all that useful + it takes up a ton of camp budget. So if I decide not to get those, only thing I care about is the tree. I mean the armor stuff is cool, same with the power armor. But I already have atom shop skins and outfits. And I'm sure there will be more released in the future that I think are cooler/want more. Especially BoS stuff. So I may end up wearing that stuff more often, which means this score stuff isn't as useful for me.
---
For me my major gripe is the level up daily. It takes forever to level and you end up grinding the same exact content I've been grinding for the past 6 months. I don't mind the grind because I didn't feel forced for time. I could do it at my own pace. Now I have a daily quota to meet and its becoming brutal.
---
I really hope that this SCORE system is just a framework and they're going to add in more score sources in the future than just dailies/weeklies. A lot of these dailies/weeklies aren't exactly fun and more of a chore. Especially the NW crap. They're supposed to be boring cause you get them "while playing the game". Which I do. But when the only reason to play the game is just to mess around and earn SCORE, then it kind of defeats that system. Maybe One Appalachia and the BoS content will make things fun again. Well see.
---
The SCORE system made the game feel like a job. When a game starts to feel like a job for me, I drop it. I'm really close to dropping this and just keeping it on watch till content comes out.
---
I‚Äôm a bow and pistol build using the gauss pistol and I just can‚Äôt use vats at all and I‚Äôm fine but I wish I could actually use a key part of the game. I was using my bow and missed 10 shots with vats and ran out of ap and finally said screw it and shot free aim and hit the target first try. A new thing I‚Äôve noticed with the bow now is that it will randomly when not using vats shoot an arrow way low even if I just shot one and hit my target the second or third somehow drops like 5 feet from me even if I fully charge it up.
---
I try to sneak so that they die before they see me, but I die a lot.
---
Yeah I should be on tomorrow afternoon
---
This is true.  You definitely have to watch your rads, managing that becomes an art form.  But it is not terribly difficult once you get used to monitoring it closely.  I always carry Toxic Goo, Rad-Away Diluted, Radshield and Brahmin Milk to keep mine in the sweet spot. Rad-X is no good because it suppresses your mutations.
---
Alright
---
NW has the all weapons are reduced 90% in weight perk card. Why cant I have that one in adventure?
---
You can tag with my group if you'd like. My gt is sloopy noodles
---
Ok and my name is like LOST NXIIISAND or something like that
---
I think they forgot the backpack
---
If you sneak behind sentrybot, or wait till he overheat, you can shoot to his core on his back, insta kill, depends on your damage it can be 1 bullet, not 500 lol ( you can target core in vats)
---
Didnt know that! So yeah that should be it!
---
Just send me a msg
---
Serendipity and sentinal armor. But cover and elevation are the best options.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing a simplified version of it for SCORE,  eg "kill 10 enemies wearing a Responder uniform", if only to justify the 700000 outfits I keep. Not the "level up while wearing a dress and farting into a tuba to kill a Wendigo" we had before. I only got 20 Atoms for that one, what a ripoff.
---
Any idea on the source for this? Would love to learn more
---
Rule 10
---
There are so many new players it's great
---
Lucky Break perk helps too.
---
I just repaired the random crap I picked up before immediately disassembling them.
---
All these people talking about tenderizer plans and legendary tenderizers, meanwhile I‚Äôve had the plans and an AASS90 Tenderizer for ages now thanks to my haxor friends...
---
I can do discord
---
Happened to me on Xbox as well seemed to stop after a few days, make the most of it my dude
---
Workshops would be the perfect conduit for a good pvp setup in adventure. They are effective resource worthless so they should just be fun pvp points. I understand they are currently but maybe create incentive for teams to take or attack them.
---
Throw a mod on it and it'll only weight 18!
---
Discord is justin#2466
---
&gt;I‚Äôm also unwilling to sit at 30% HP with 1 endurance and minimal damage mitigating perks. 
---
The hell you're talking about, Bloodied has crazypants mitigation. Serendipity. Ricochet. Nerd Rage. Dodgy. Evasive, if you're so inclined. Add the recent Carnivore food buffs on top of that, and you're in fact invincible. Go look up AngryTurtle's video on YouTube on the matter.
---
Nice suggestion, HEAR this BETHESDA!
---
Same. I've cut it real close before but so far I've logged off a minute before reset and given it a few minutes and I've been fine so far.
---
eh, there might be people who are just weird in general when it comes to interacting in games but whenever you are a female it just happens more frequently.
---
Yeah being a tank was never great in this game. Your best bet is a pa heavy gunner running vamps weapons
---
Yeah, I never took levelling seriously before as well but now it became much more important and it's really not that hard to keep all these buffs when you get used to it -))
---
You misunderstand my statements. I reiterate, the conflict between the Settlers and Raiders is (for this video game) a narrative framing device‚Äî it‚Äôs a misinterpretation to think of it as a delivery vector for the ideological development of one non-existent Appalachian regime over another. The framework‚Äôs purpose is to distinguish (at the surface-level) between two imaginary groups for the sake of play. I would argue that few (if any) political distinctions between them exist in the conventional sense. Yes, the narrative informs us these groups both wish to dominate the region (one via supremacy, the other via societal cohesion), and one can easily see how this is reflective of a struggle between ‚ÄúIndividualism‚Äù and ‚ÄúCollectivism,‚Äù but these are subjective constructs that do not exist (in-game) in any material manner, and are (in-life) representative of almost every political identity. I‚Äôm sorry to belabor the point, but these respective groups are merely shorthand for our perceptions/expectations/projections about how these two fictional groups might act following the apocalypse‚Äî whether they live up to those expectations is simply a matter of personal interpretation. 
---
I think you‚Äôre getting tripped up here because you‚Äôve conflated ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù with ‚Äúpolitical identity.‚Äù Yes, Raiders and Settlers inescapably share aspects with political parties, but so does ANY aggregate collective of human beings (like your extended family, the back-benchers of an NFL team, a kindergarten class in a midwestern elementary school, a crowd in a theater, local municipal employees on Labor Day, Mardi Gras float operators, etc). The mere overlap of these aspects does not create a representative political constituency.
---
But, if you still feel that killing a raider for snatching away Foundation‚Äôs last mole-powered sandwich press is a political decision and not actually just part of the ‚ÄúSettler vs Raider‚Äù narrative framework (‚Äúthe story outside of the story‚Äù), then that‚Äôs just where we‚Äôll have to disagree.
---
As an aside, your interpretation of Ward, Foundation, and whether the raiders are fundamentally evil is your own and one which I do not agree with, but you really should worry too much about what I think. Enjoy the game however you like.
---
If they were a thing like KotH where they award say, an XP buff up to a certain percent according to the time you‚Äôve held it, that would be nice.
---
That would be amazing. I liked the survival map (had some issues) and miss that feeling I'd be shot any second. Want that a bit in adventure.
---
I've built at that location a few times. There's also a huge stone arch right near there that makes for good camp building. 
---
The SB's are a pain.
---
it's essentially a water pump for floors
---
The sink might be clean, but the water isn‚Äôt, lol üòÇüëç
---
Check out the big brain on Brett! Guy's right, drop a bobby pin and see if that does it.
---
Happened to me several times. Also ran into launcher no-show fights too. Maybe the silo drained all their resources so the queen was simply too much to handle. But really a gat laser is all you need to do it alone, it won‚Äôt take many cores either.
---
Thanks for the tip, and I might build toward that some day, but I‚Äôm fine just dying fast for now. I‚Äôm usually sneaky when I‚Äôm on my own and just hide in the back when playing with friends.
---
I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm basically a coward and don‚Äôt wanna get hit
---
From what I've come across, from the few people who use area chat, it's mostly always male players. Most of the female players I've met(on any game actually) were generally playing with other friends already. As a guy, I can't say that I clearly understand how bad the toxicity is for females but I generally play solo to avoid most of the assholes. 
---
My psn is "steinxfrank" if you'd like any help or anything. I'd be more than happy to help out newer players whether it's gear, a supporting player, or even just advice.(just hate the self-entitled players who expect everything to be spoon-fed though haha)
---
It's not hard to do, but I sacrificed a good chunk of damage in the process switching 6 points from str and couple more from other stats into int to get its base to 14. Got enough to one/two-shot everything except sbq/colossus anyway.
---
People are missing the point I think. 
---
Regardless of Skyrim re-releases, BGS did in fact make a bold jump with 76.... Whether you're a fan of not, they went out of their comfort zone.
---
Hmm never thought of that but I have to say that it's pretty much out of reach except if you own a Prydwen.
---
Nah I run Junkie and it could use a small buff, and with every other build lol. Junkies is for sure the second best build tho.
---
nobody actually has to play an instrument, as long as the jukebox is on you'll be fine. But the people that camp the ghoul spawn are pretty lame
---
Brain Bombs = +3 INT for 90 Mins. +6 with Herbivore. +7.5 with Stange in Numbers.
---
Easier to farm ingredients for than Broiled Scorchbeast Brains.
---
I did that today at whitesprings. Someone was upstairs still collecting items and I found a 3* legendary downstairs and did the follow me emote twice so they could get in on it as well. 
---
I see no reason to one shot or hide them for others.
---
I love moments like this in NW lol. I get lots of laughs out of it. Few days ago when we had the pick 3 locks challenge, I was up top @ Monogah picking that lock in the trailer, some dude in PA comes barreling in, stands next to me obviously waiting for me to finish picking it, then killed my ass after. I was like well that was considerate lol
---
To my knowledge, anything that can be bought with gold bullion cannot be traded or dropped.(both plans and the items crafted)
---
Maybe, but I'm not a 1st user...
---
no, stop. I can only get so erect
---
Unfortunately no. They‚Äôre not available to sell or trade, and dropping the item destroys it.
---
That being said, I can‚Äôt verify that you can‚Äôt gift the plan itself, as I‚Äôve never tried to do so.
---
Telsas can cause one of the variants of ‚Äúdamage bug‚Äù where you are unable to do damage outside of VATS until you server hop. It used to happen alot with TSE weapons early on, and at that point you could not do ranged damage, even it VATS, until you server hopped. 
---
In other words, you are not getting XP because all damage you are doing is being rubberbanded outside of VATS.
---
I've noticed that too! What's even more frustrating to me are the people who say oh, just fire after charging in VATS, not charging first, that works every time!
---
No, no it doesn't, and if your target is moving you might not hit even when you normally think you would.
---
Well that bites, but thank you for the response. One good thing is I can take a break from collecting darn vacuum tubes and retrieving all that stolen stuff (you would think after the first few times they would upgrade their security). LoL
---
Well i just got out of a match where i landed 3 headshots with my sniper build (rifle damage perks + bloody mess + rifles ignore a % of armor) and none of them died.  
---
Which means that the scoped hunting rifle is the most useless weapon in NW :)
---
gnomes are the only thing that can defeat them wandering mannequinns
---
I feel like we'll get some kind of event eventually. Its an easy go to for something players would love. I want something like the sbq fight but with waves of cultists instead of scorched, but it would need a little something extra to make it spooky. But maybe instead of a nuke its just a rare event or one that only pops up once every few in game nights or something?
---
People seem to forget that xp is tide to score. Faster you level up, faster you get score. 
---
Besides I‚Äôm pretty sure I read somewhere that each point of intelligence is worth 2% xp gain. If that‚Äôs the case (or even in the ball park) that‚Äôs 8% plus xp for being on a fully bonded team. Then you add in buffs from food, inspiration, etc. 
---
I‚Äôm like 215 right now and I‚Äôve made probably 30 or so levels since score went live. Building teams are way underrated.
---
Assuming this continues down the road it makes me wonder if someone on the design team for Seasons goofed the math and genuinely thought that the previous amount of dailies was more than adequate., and that this was an emergency scramble after so many people pointed out the bad math.
---
If I were able to reach it, I'll just use the take all button, I guess..  but it's so far that I'm not really sure that is my bag, maybe another player die the same way... but higher.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs almost impossible to hit with vats I don‚Äôt care what anyone says I get lucky every now and again and my bow has 33 vats hit chance tf is up with it not hitting. No vats for me I just practice a lot on low level enemies to gauge the best way to shoot at what distance and hope for the best and hope the arrow doesn‚Äôt randomly fall short.
---
I tried, it didn't. But it was a good guess, my friend.
---
Ugh, their stupid hide and lock on combat system they've had in everything is absolute dog vomit too.
---
The only good games RockStar ever made was Bully and Max Payne.
---
Or someone drops before you can get to a workbench.
---
Wow a month of 8h of playing? Thats a lot.  
---
I mean you usually get more XP from actually playing the game but even if would take 4x more XP by playing NW (compared to going AFK) but could only play 1h a day that means it would take about 2 months of playing everyday!
---
As somebody with a full weapon weight reduction armor set, I can tell you that carrying around 80 weapons in your inv lags you intensely. The game isn't able to handle that much
---
I‚Äôm sorry I have had the same issue is why I thought to give it a try it worked for me. Just have some people with fallout first stack tentsüòÇ
---
Are you sure it wasn't suppressed with Rad-X?
---
FYI, self posts don't get karma.
---
80 weapons? I bet it lags!
---
Nope, I was using the jetpack and had the marsupial mutation and the strangers in numbers perk active at the moment, as I said, and it was still out of reach.
---
How amazing would it have been if it had been like the drinking fountain at whitespring?? That would have been great
---
I *always* start a building team as soon as i get on, if there isnt one with a slot open already.
---
No you cannot. Items crafted with these plans are locked to the player who learned the plan.
---
Right, I'm at the point I need to move my camp, I have to try 5/6 times before I get a world where I can place my camp.
---
Or the game pass influx, lol
---
Yes, game was severely lagged, quests weren't triggering for several minutes, map wasn't updating for several minutes.  Had to exit the game and come back to get workshops and some other stuff to show up.
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied build I don‚Äôt kill the night stalker but I try to protect those playing the instruments
---
Yeah that is more likely
---
Well thank you for the replies everyone. I guess I can see why we can‚Äôt but it bites nonetheless. Hopefully they will add stuff to the list for those of us that don‚Äôt care about armor or weapons lol.
---
oh ya
---
That‚Äôs the way!
---
Honestly I'd love something to do with Canada or a snowy area. I think snow would be a neat new constant weather
---
I'm quite often the ore guy, or one of them. I don't mind as I'm not too worried about the farming aspect but damn I want that barrel plan!
---
I guess since it is a death bag and not one of dropped items it doesn't works, if not I should be easy to retrieve any loot after respawning, just drop something and you don't have to walk to your death point. But as I said, it was a good guess. I actually try  droping some of the materials I got from the mirelurk king's corpse...
---
I think you have to buy it at top of the world vendor
---
The Explosive Gatling Plasma is incredibly fun for sure, I like jet packing around raining explosive death from above while making jet noises haha.
---
Could possibly be a visual bug. Have you attempted to craft the long barrel after you‚Äôve seen this faulty notification?
---
Then I have no clue. Sorry.
---
But GTA5 for the PS5 is going to have expanded storyline content and new online stuff. You should watch the video on it, I personally think it looks rather neat, and I must say, my husband and I have played GTA5 through at least a dozen times and he has spent countless hours playing the online part.
---
Grand Theft Auto has, since moving away from a frantic, chaotic 2D experience, been nothing but trash. 
---
Every aspect of it is low brow.
---
Yeah, seeing this too. Sigh :(
---
honestly im kinda tired of the same old events, this sounds amazing
---
The bobbypin economy going to crash with the new legendary perk.  :(
---
I run a Bloodied Melee build. With my current set-up, my DR/ER is 500/400 when under 20% health. I also have Blocker to reduce melee attacks, Lone Wanderer to reduce damage in general, Fireproof to reduce explosion damage and the SB sonic attacks, and Serendipity to reduce incoming damage. Most of my deaths now come from poison attacks when I‚Äôm careless and don‚Äôt stim. Outside of that, I can just run into mobs and be confident I won‚Äôt get wrecked.
---
If you prefer full-health, Vanguard‚Äôs armor is a good alternative to PA, with the Born Survivor perk card to back you up. There are also plenty of food buffs to increase your max HP and regen.
---
Same for me- the others were easy enough to knock off, but that for 250 just doesn‚Äôt make me wanna do it.
---
you can't post images. you can just put a link to imgur or whatever in the text, I'd be interested in seeing it
---
You have to be somewhat close to the bag for it to work that‚Äôs why I thought to have someone place a tent down and try to get close to it I think it‚Äôs like 2 camp floors apart for it to work but you get any further and it won‚Äôt merge bags.
---
Like I said, it's not. Chems are all identical, weapons and armor are not. Most of this game relies on keywords. Let's take bufftats for example. It's treated as an aid item, as a chem item, as a buffout drug, as a mentats drug, etc. If there is an effect that searches for any mentats drug, it would apply to all bufftats in your inventory because they are labeled as such. Weapon weight reduction armor just takes anything that is listed as a weapon; that is its own effect. That is why it stacks with perks like bear arms, because "weapon reduction" is treated as a separate effect from "heavy weapon reduction", while "junk reduction" is the same both from the perk card and from armor and therefore your max from any combination of the two is 90%.
---
The way I see it, it might be possible for the weightless effect to give something a weightless keyword, since we know attachments can change them. The best example is that grips add the pistol keyword and stocks add the rifle keyword so it's treated as one depending on the attachment. Then you would need to have a hidden default perk that always reduces the weight of all of those by 90%. This would be great, but it goes back to the same issue I mentioned before: if it's an effect applied to the character and not applied to the item directly, then it wouldn't work inside your stash or anywhere else. And if it's applied to the item directly, engine limitations only allow it to add or subtract a static amount of weight without accounting for attachments
---
You dont sign up for it, its only accessible through the Bethesda launcher and its treated as a separate game to download. 
---
So you would open the Bethesda launcher, search through the list of games for Fallout 76 PTS and download it. Once its installed, you then launch it like you would any other game. It creates a clone of your character and the clone will then be on its own progression in the pts. So if you play the pts for a few hours and then switch back over to regular 76, your regular character will not update based on what you did in the pts and vice versa.
---
As a bloodied build. I can tell you it‚Äôs very rare for me to die. I switch my build between unarmed or shotgun. With the appropriate perk cards, both being bloodied. I wear heavy combat brotherhood unyielding armor, except for my unyielding jet pack secret service chest piece. They usually give me pretty good protection. 
---
The only time I find myself dying a lot are because of the following reasons
---
1-I fall for more than 5 feet and die from fall damage 
---
2-The SQ queen slaps me to death. 
---
3-Imposter Sheepsquatch‚Äôs l√°ser kills me. 
---
Other than that, I don‚Äôt really die as much as you think I do. The perks of being overpowered means you can kill everything around you really quickly.
---
I don't have imgur or really any image hosting site (is imgur the one owned by facebook?). I'm wondering if google docs would be easy to import the info into. Not that I've ever used google docs.
---
Ah gotcha! Thanks for the info!!!
---
I have the exact same issue with the pop up saying ive unlcoked something but nothing actually unlocked.
---
Ive got no mods unlocked for it yet and ive scrapped 18 so far...
---
Lol, I didn‚Äôt do it but I‚Äôd have made like 10 level 1 guns, shot them a few times and repaired them
---
You can also stack a bunch of PA frames, hop on one, place another, etc, can get you pretty high up too.
---
Did you take berry mentats by accident? Those make living things and turrets glow that exact color..
---
OP if you need assistance in game please DM me and I will be more than glad to help.
---
Yes this is correct.
---
I would like to play with you, I'm woman, I play on ps4, I'm shy, but english isn't my first language and I don't have the confidence to talk but I'm happy to see a lot of people wanting to play with you, good luck in Appalachia! ‚ô°
---
You've been touched by his noodly.... wait wrong deity. You have been blessed by the ever illustrious flatwoods monster.
---
Np. If you're close to max with your gold and not interested in the weapons, have you already purchased the secret service armor? I believe it is supposed the best overall. 
---
Taking a break from the dailies does sound like a good idea though, gets pretty tiring at how much of a grind some things can be. If you interested in still doing some dailies, have you done the "tipsy taste test"?
---
Tbh I dunno, I think it was in an Inside the Vault recently. But it might have been reddit. You can look at the Bethesda replied bot and check around to see if it was said in a comment by a community manager/developer. I don't think there's any other source I would have remembered that from
---
It's the Flatwoods Monster. He can take control of nearby enemies, your turrets, whatever. Pretty rare spawn as far as encounters go.

imgur is super duper easy to use you don't need an account or anything. just click the button that says "+New Post" in the top left then select the image file on your computer. then just copy the url of the page it takes you to and paste it in reddit.

Interesting
---
My guess is that the disability of lacking empathy doesn't adversely affect gameplay in NW.
---
I was able to find someone, thanks team!
---
Yeah, probably stacked with Serendipity
---
The three perks that gave you a damage reduction if you wore 5 matching pieces of armor. The way I see it, that rewarded having a consistent base instead of consistent perk. If you have a full set of sturdy armor (like thorn or solar), it's far more likely that you have a mix of effects rather than all the same. If you have all the same unyielding armor, it's more likely a mix of various parts. Of course a bloodied build could still benefit from those perks, but it would be less likely than a non-bloodied build just based on how the game works. I don't remember the others off the top of my head, but one good non-bloodied perk that's still there is what rads, which is basically sun kissed but much stronger.
---
The obvious exception would be the people who have a full set of duped unyielding powered sentinel heavy combat armor, but cheaters don't matter when considering the people who actually play the game
---
1 - yes it is but you get used to it and having vendors and being able to buy plans cheap and fast travel to areas easier is a lot better then in the beginning when the barn plans cost us 2000 caps and you couldn‚Äôt go anywhere new until you discovered it. 
---
2 - you have to click the button to bring up the social menu and then scroll to teams and join one. You will get notifications when your teammates complete challenges. 
---
3 - trading is done by walking up to someone and hitting the indicated button (I‚Äôm on PS4 so I am not sure which it is but for us it is triangle). There is no in game dialog or chat option so a mic is your only option. Pacifist mode will make it so players can‚Äôt hurt you and you cannot accidentally hurt them when shooting if they run into you. It is turned on/off through the settings menu. 
---
4 - how you play is up to you. The main quest line helps you open the map or at least it did before vendors came along. The side stuff is just that. Some people follow the main quests and ignore side stuff, others want to build, and some focus on whatever pops up and the side stuff like the tadpoles and mistress of murder stuff (can‚Äôt remember there exact name of it). 
---
5 - you can talk over a mic and the other players can hear you even if they don‚Äôt respond back. You can set your mic preferences to area/team/none/auto. If you are talking about an out of game party, not many players I have met like them unless they are part of some discord group and there are a bunch talking. But if you join a team, as explained above, you can talk to your teammates.
---
What pisses me off are that they require visuals. It has annoyed me since FO4 and the delay in combat as the game has to show you plunging it on yourself. It's only stimpacks though. They never visually show you using Radaway or Buffout or Psycho, for example.
---
Yes, it's moderate damage and moderate rate of fire make it arguably the best heavy gun without exploiting high fire rate or other bugs.  It also has very cheap ammo.  It's downside is bad range.  It's my main heavy weapon, although I also have an ultracite gatling to burn up my extra cores and paint yellow lines in the sky like a glowing one pissing at the moon, and a .50 cal to shoot stupid scorch beasts flying halfway across the map because again cheap ammo, but super long range.
---
I use my op guns a lot in uranium fever. I just bash with them instead of shoot. 
---
That way I get my tag work minimal damage done
---
First of all. BGS has been using Creation since Skyrim. Released in 2011. So 2 decades? Try again. 
---
Game engines are expensive. 
---
Game engines are complicated. 
---
Game engines take a long time to create. UE4 began development in like 2008? And wasn't released until like what? 2015 (it's not like it's even a from scratch engine either
---
There is a option for pacifist mode you cant  hurt anyone or same to you
---
Speaking of my camp is powered by 20 secreted silent generators within a 1x1 with half steel walls and a roof- so compact yet elegant as heck. I put the CAMP module in there too before shutting the lid. Definitely recommend.
---
Was gonna say 500 is the norm for some of us :P
---
I personally love cliff side and clifftop camps, mines just above the freak show and the view of the big and watoga is beautiful, plus I always know when a nuke hits even if I'm not paying attention

Pacifist mode and block users
---
Were you at a workshop? We‚Äôre they on your friends list? That is spooky
---
How do I get into pacifist mode?
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to it, but I'm definitely a little worried about the implementation
---
Yeah as an 'end gamer' I guess you'd say I figured if at Lvl 130 I have most of the plans then MOST people would too- so without those a good stack of better ammo and 3* I didn't need more than one vendor.
---
I just want peeps to shop in peace lol AND get some good prices on shit they need to keep the killing going.
---
Or just make a snowy mountain biome near us. Canada/U.S. border area would be a cool standalone Fallout game location tho.
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten the armor, mainly because I  not a typical player who is all into the fixer/handmade. I give them to the scrap box all the time, whether 1,2 or 3 stars lol. 
---
I have played with biv some but maybe will go visit him again. I enjoy doing the score stuff and building-rebuilding my camp. I was just hoping to help out other players in the game.  
---
Someone once posted that Ward has a scam going where he sells the equipment and then has us get it back for him, losing only a small % of the profit he makes, and the more I helped him the more I thought...man, I think this guy is right lol. And as for the tubes...maybe if you didn‚Äôt settle in a darn toxic waste dump your stuff would last longer *smh* lol. Even my hubby questioned why they were there as it didn‚Äôt look very inviting (he doesn‚Äôt play 76).
---
This is a test: https://imgur.com/a/y2zMTuI
---
Edit: Sweet, Thank you :)
---
look like a salt shaker? it looks like a meat tenderizer (aka a hammer), with a salt shaker strapped on the side if you mod it. i love it but its so heavy
---
My handmade that should weigh like 20 pounds is only like 9, all modded . Still dumb but it does reduce a little bit when you compare it to something with the same mods.
---
The one where he basically says BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH (might even be before he says that line you posted) is the WORST.
---
Irl I have a newborn and he scrunched his face up every time Fasnacht spoke. So that was the clincher lol
---
It might have been less. I honestly can‚Äôt remember, but yeah I think that‚Äôs about right
---
Tell me more tell me more did you get pretty far?
---
Knowing NW is basically a luck competition it doesn‚Äôt give me any anxiety whatsoever. When i find nothing but pipe or axe I know there‚Äôs not going to be much fight, when I find a gatling or 50 cal i know I‚Äôll be among top 3. It‚Äôs too predictable and less fun than it should be.
---
Your HP caps with your endurance, so nothing after 50 really effects it.  As for 1 shot yes, just depends on your build/perks and weapons.
---
Happened today.  Think fast traveling fixed it, but it might have been a re-log.
---
Been getting an error with my handmade to saying no ammo of correct type and have to swap guns and swap back.
---
Also been having inventory not working, change to the AID tab and it still shows the weapons list.  Have to exit and come back.
---
Same with hotkey wheel, although it's rare in adventure mode, it's all the time in NW.
---
Same here. But I removed gunsmith 5 and finally used some of those repair kits I never use
---
From what I've read legendary perks suck ass, so I'm in no hurry to get there.
---
Some of the cards people share make me wonder...I like to share stuff everyone would benefit from, so I share the xp buff if in a team card, whatever the fuck it's called.
---
Go to point pleasant and steal some of his eggs. You‚Äôll meet him.
---
I got two Level 2s trying to initiate PVP as I tried to give them plans and Aid outside of 76.
---
They left the aid and kept running around trying to attack others, I guess. I just did the Confused emote and FTed to my Camp. I went back and picked up the stuff half an hour later.
---
On the Flip side, I found a 4 and 10 travelling together, bought a bunch of junk from the 10's vendors and dropped the plans and Aid for the 4. I felt like a weirdo trying to beckon them over but I like to make sure that people get the stuff I drop.
---
I've not seen the SBQ nuke since Thursday night though.
---
It's under settings.  On PC go to your map then open the menu and select settings.
---
They shouldn't be able to follow you across servers unless they're on your friends list unless this is a feature of the console version.
---
I dont use mentats
---
Its in the options but only while in game, people can still kill you in pacifist mode but its a lot harder and you lose your junk if you die but you cannot kill anyone else
---
when in game stories to little they build a wheel to keep busy gamers..
---
I guess I'm the weird one running around with a normal body, eh? kind of feel like mutations should be like a bad thing cause you know...radiation is bad for you? Would be super cool if they added to how you looked though.
---
awesome! thanks for sharing!
---
Still chasing that jacket üòû
---
At first I was at a workshop and I know if a high level kills me I just run off but I fast traveled to my camp and they fast traveled close to my camp then when I walked out of my house there they was I couldn‚Äôt even fight back then I went to another server and I would be running around and I started getting shot then I‚Äôm dead I saw them run up and started tea bagging me. So I started reporting them and I would go to the next world and they was there. I don‚Äôt have them on my friend I maybe have 13 friends on my ps4.
---
You can be sure that you're contributing to the sbq with it.
---
Probably just you lol. Overall the chance to get three star loot from three star creatures has been buffed in latest patch, no doubt about it. But quality wise I don‚Äôt see a big difference. It used to be one star ghoul slayer pistol from the queen, now at least most of the time it‚Äôs a three star ghoul slayer something.
---
&gt; unyielding
---
New to the game but is there a power armor option for that?
---
Be grateful they don't have guilds (as of yet). Imagine having to submit resumes to join a raiding guild, like applying for a corporate job.
---
You're welcome, glad it helped some one else.
---
Doesn't fit anyone's build? 
---
Spoken like a person who lacks creativity.
---
Best to get an exploding weapon and use grenadier perk to increase area.
---
It's laughably sad that the weapon basically made exactly for this sort of thing is bugged to not work when you use it for this sort of thing...
---
Uranium Fever plays in my head whenever the event pops ip
---
1 - Xbox Game Pass
---
2 - Meh
---
3 - Not Really
---
It‚Äôs a Bethesda game. Welcome.
---
This game is on game pass? I have it but live in Canada so maybe it‚Äôs different.
---
Edit: I have Xbox game pass
---
lol, updoot for "clownshoe"
---
I think the point isn't that we don't expect to work for an item, but it should at least be fun, and not repetitive, boring crap.
---
I really wish the devs put a lot more into the end-game stuff, and replaced a lot of the RNG with a build system.
---
Level 1 was zero, level 2 was 1000 needed.
---
What mutations boost carry weight? I've never really used them tbh
---
rip RDO
---
The issue is most likely solved by relaunching the game
---
If you block them via the psn then you will never join a server with them again. I have thankfully only had to do that with 4 people the whole time I have been playing (started with beta). But it works, or at least it used to. Hope they leave you alone. What is psn name? Or you can PM it to me and I will add you and look for you and happily buy something out of your vendor for 2000 caps. It can be a single Bobby pin for all I care. Would just be happy to help out.
---
How is your health bar like that?? Someone explain
---
Oh, ok I didn't knew that, thanks.
---
I think the issue is there are far too many useless weapons in this game.. At Fo76 release they were probably quite good but continued nerfs have degraded a ton of weapons into obscurity sadly.. So no matter what star it is its still bad.
---
if there were fewer, and they each produced a unique good (eg nuka colas, stealth boys, etc)
---
1. Xbox Game Pass or buying used or on sale
---
2. Yes, sometimes it‚Äôs runs decent other times it‚Äôs almost game breaking
---
3. It‚Äôs can be, if don‚Äôt spend on atoms or go atomic shop you shouldn‚Äôt really noticed it but if you do it‚Äôs crazy. The price is off. They selling a skin for a gun for $5 and it‚Äôs bugged (not sure if they fix it yet). I would still to session pass, really good stuff on that, mostly free except you can pay for level if you want. Not sure when will season will end but if start from day one people are saying you will barely make it. So start playing now if you want to. lol
---
Absolutely this.
---
That's not a  bad idea but I just carry the one with me, if someday I got to properly manage my carry weight, I'll carry more. Thanks
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/368
---
I think he's saying they should add bottom text saying 90% reduced weight. Then under in small text it says, "except mods".
---
Used low level armor i picked up so it didnt require ballistic fiber. Low level weapons take less materials as well.
---
My lowest (and first unyielding build) has got 65 levels since score started. The exp boost from teams is crazy if you have the right perks shared and mutations, plus it's SO much easier to farm events with all these public teams, plus Lunchboxes. Double xp weekend is gonna be wild
---
Bloodied melee build here I‚Äôm around 35-40 strength. Without strong back I have around 515 carry weight at about 20% hp. I can get to about 540 if I really need to get stuff home.  Then strong back. At +50-100 more pounds I‚Äôd almost be able to carry all the legendaries I can‚Äôt scrip.
---
Guys let's keep politics out of this issue mkay
---
What is gamepass? I'm not sure it exists in Aus
---
Agreed
---
A subterranean dlc would be the fun - maybe call it ‚ÄúSubterrania.‚Äù There is so much to work with. You could have a mole miner town, explore tunnels dug out by the motherload, explore huge radioactive caverns created the underground atomic detonations by AMS or encounter nests of scorchbeasts.
---
I'd like it to not be a shit colour and to not have silly decals on it..... Lord what I'd give for standard, plain matte blacks, chromes etc... Other than the handmade and that SCORE one later in the track there's only these garish reds, blues and whatever.
---
Oh, and the worlds slowest bolt action now has a ghillie AND a camo to its name... Meanwhile... Most other guns yet to see any love..... So tragic.
---
Np, you can actually find several PA frames in Watoga alone, get one or two and you can start stacking, you can always drop them afterwards. Good luck!
---
I am a new player on xbox, a guy allowed me to enter his crib and started playing the guitar for me. It was awesome for me until he left and locked me inside.
---
It's Microsoft game subscription. 
---
 - https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass
---
Ughh....fixer this, handmade that, two shot, bloody, explosive...I swear so many people are focused on nothing but the typical meta lol
---
For Biv, the recipe I farmed for was "Rad-ant lager". The only ingredient that I have a tough time getting is the ant meat but the 50+ carry weight is nice for a hoarder like myself(though you have to be careful since after the minute of 50+, it's a minute of 50-). Nothing wrong with that at all. You choose how you want to play. 
---
Lol, those theories make a bunch of sense. I think one of the few dailies that does make sense though is giving mirelurk meat so they can sell it off
---
I see i don't own a Xbox thats why i'd never seen it.
---
If you have 3 STR you can get 30% out of it and 5 INT for stabilized.  Otherwise the perks are the same, bloody mess, nerd rage etc. unyielding armor, adrenal reaction mutation, chems/food/drink.
---
If you have extra points 9 STR can get you up to 60% damage bonus.
---
Legendary perks with update 22 will let you have additional stat points.
---
Figured I‚Äôd just ask you but I started playing it for my first time now that it‚Äôs on game pass and I thought there wasn‚Äôt npc‚Äôs in this game but so far it feels like a normal fallout with npc‚Äôs all over. Was the game different at launch? Or did I understand that incorrectly
---
I'm playing as I usually play. If SCORE happens, it happens. I don't go hunting for it.
---
lol no one in the thread was a gas bag just the ones that judge for playing
---
Thank you, I fixed it. Image should be correct now.
---
Where do people find gf:s &amp; wives that play lol, my wife cant stand my ps4
---
I found a pristine buttercup id like to display but no luck
---
So, is literally any melee build better then trying to be a buffy melee?
---
Stash? I carry all mine around with me
---
Common bug.  You will undoubtedly get it with exploring locations and such too.
---
Leveling another character sometimes works, but sometimes doesn't.
---
Contacting Bethesda sometimes works, but sometimes doesn't.
---
Never had that problem, but that does suck. Hopefully you get some good participants.
---
Radiation rumble too. I got like 5 legendarys and 12k exp.
---
I don't either, it's for PC also. The PC version has a few less games and is much cheaper, good deal for less than 5 bucks a month though.
---
Thanks but I finally surrendered and left it floating in the sky...
---
Why tf does this have so many downvotes
---
Btw, some one pointed out that level 1 should have been zero xp which throws the math off. I fixed it on this table: [https://imgur.com/a/aiHxi1b](https://imgur.com/a/aiHxi1b) (just so you don't use the wrong table).
---
I do. I generally have a group I play with or more often, I run solo. I'm on Xbox though.
---
I also don't often use voice chat just because I'm not a huge talker, other than swearing occasionally when I screw up. Even my friends in party chat have to ask if I'm still there. Also, I usually have the washer/dryer running and I'm right around the corner from the laundry room, and nobody wants to hear that.
---
No I'm not a little bitch
---
Any max HP works.  You can just use food rather than Lifegiver.
---
PSN calliope_sky
---
I play a lot. I have a mic but dont like to talk much. My husband and I play together frequently. You're welcome to send me a friend request. Im also "old", as in 46, lol.
---
Shoot first, kill them in 1 shot, profit.
---
Psn is TipGangGod96 and you don‚Äôt have to do that tbh I just really needed help to end that situation! But I really appreciate the help!!üíØ
---
Best - jetpack
---
Worst - gauntlet. I'm not even melee, I don't know what I was thinking
---
Literally started a dr who marathon yesterday with the 9th Doc lol just beat the mighty Jagrafress and Simon Peg. 
---
Yes- there are loads of girl players! Be careful who you befriend tho! I haven't spoken to a "random" ever since a friend who was a random turned super controlling and toxic. I came here for advice and heard that sort of stuff happens to a lot of girls on here. 
---
But I've never had a problem running around as a girl. Most people refer to me as a guy in area chat anyway lol.
---
Like what?
---
I think some mods are rare plan drops only.
---
I've played long enough like over a year to realized that carryweight is not really a problem. you just need to use your junks, organize things, &amp; control our pack-rat behavior. enhance your armor or get legendary armor parts with cw reduction bonuses like -20% junk, weapons, ammo, &amp; specially aids. aids are the ones cosuming your cw that much. equip that agi hiker perk.
---
There‚Äôs a team in silo Bravo in the server I‚Äôm in right now
---
Gutsy has the best dialogue in the game IMO, and I would pay big atoms to have one in my camp, talking shit about commie maggots and making some other poor bastard die for his country.
---
interesting
---
So when do we get more stash space
---
Getting tired of running out of space
---
Why it even has a limit is beyond me
---
I wanna hoard stuff
---
Yes same, when using number keys to switch weapons
---
and running , sometimes it does not
---
New Bugs !
---
Jean
---
Whats ur gt
---
I‚Äôm relatively new to the game and never considered this. Damn... might have to find a good bloodied weapon and the armor as well and see how it runs. Maybe if the purveyor stopped giving me pistols for hunting mirelucks at night....
---
I'm looking at my map and there's one player over level 100 besides me. It's too much ammo to solo the queen unless you're hellbent on doing so.
---
Uh... doesn‚Äôt it add like 14 pounds?
---
I usually run up to people and give them alot of water and some stims it's a great way to start a small conversation when im bored but ive only meet about a handfull of girls when doing this
---
The smokin gun!
---
Thanks I will add it to the list. Once I actually have a completed list I will probably post it here although I think making a new topic might be the best idea.
---
Room for a third? I can help.
---
I made a new friend level 10 who happened to be on my public team.  He followed me everywhere and we got him to level 12 before I had to  log out.  Gave him all the weapons/armor I got from the 4 Leader of the Packs I did today, built him a fusion generator, good times if you find the right person.
---
Quite the opposite, I wanna play the game, not do some chores. Ive done every daily so far, so Im not pulling shit out of thin air, the challenges are killing the game more than its helping it. 
---
Also that quote of yours is so bullshit my guy, you dont know how much I play this game and grind for content
---
I am trying to give critique to a fairly new addition to the game. If you disagree scroll past the post or come with a valid argument rather than being a cunt about it
---
That was probably it, thanks. In radiation rumble at least I was only there because the team leader did the c‚Äômere emote, and I think at least one team member was at uranium fever too. 
---
Damn, that‚Äôs really useful.
---
Im not sure if I get your point üò¨
---
Chef Boyar-ddos
---
I don‚Äôt intend to spoil it for everyone, why don‚Äôt you talk to her yourself?
---
I just want nuclear winter changes
---
The very reasons I quit playing. Grind, and more grind, plus insane amounts of FOMO! Oh and arbitrary limits. LOW arbitrary limits. I just want to relax after work, not clock in for my 2nd job.
---
A bit late comment but I have had this problem too for the past two weeks. Tried everything to troubleshoot and no luck. You‚Äôre not alone. Did it get resolved in the end?
---
It‚Äôs midnight and I don‚Äôt want to wake my family up?
---
Talk to her tomorrow then. Good night.
---
DOWN WITH THE COLD, CEMENTED HEARTS OF THE GNOMES. THEIR PORCELAIN HANDS HAVE SLIT THE SEAMS OF A TEDDY ONE TOO MANY. I CANNOT BEAR IT ANY LONGER.
---
I dont mind it, when it happens I shop players vendors
---
That‚Äôs especially stupid as there is 5.56 Nato ammunition also, which is actually used by the Handmade ingame.
---
Cool, I'll try that! Thanks
---
Where do you get the letters? Havent played since it first came out so im kinda lost.
---
Maybe? If your on PS4 I can put one on for you
---
Buy the vault 94 mask. Its a good buillion sink :p
---
I'm so sick of this. You have to be as still as a stone statue at times for stimpacks to work. Please make it inject quicker!
---
And if you take a workshop they can attack you
---
For raw damage, JE Gatling Plasma. It melts everything, but now, it makes the game boring.
---
I have a faster swing speed on that did wonders during Fasnacht. I haven't tried druing RR yet though. No one seems to do it on Xbox anymore. Hell, tbh, I barely see many people on Xbox in general nowadays.
---
Damage is all that matters. It gets incredibly annoying when everything becomes a bullet sponge at higher levels.
---
URANIUM FEVER HAS GONE AND GOT ME DOWN!
---
Marsupial
---
I got a bloodied ffr one for 7k
---
Get marsupial perk +20 carry weight
---
You're probably missing the heated coil mod, which is a rare drop from events the valley and savage divide. It's the only one I'm still missing, so I bought a mod instead.

THIS DEATHCLAW WELLINGTON IS SO FUCKING RAW ITS STILL ROARING
---
Broken arrow incidents in the swamp would be cool
---
Because it's not the truth.  People that report bugs are talking to customer service, customer service if a fucking call center and has ZERO power to do anything beyond reading from a database of responses and sending reports to the actual devs.  
---
You get people like this asking support for their challenges to be reset or for score to be added to their account or for free atoms to pay for their missed ranks and when support says they literally do not have the power to do that you get people like this acting like they just spoke with the head of the dev team who just told them they're never fixing this and they can go fuck themselves.
---
Yeah I'm the same boat, 90% of it I will probs never use and the stuff I do want is all front end loaded
---
Quest is literally un-finishable for me. I've spent 3 hours and multiple runs of my time only to have the robots glitch and stay locked in their pods and not come out. In multiple parts of the quest. I was really enjoying this game but this quest has really bummed me out. Especially to see that this was a problem 2 months ago and STILL hasn't been fixed.
---
&gt;I want to look like one of those caravan brahmin
---
"Call me Chally, baby".
---
It's not a water purifier
---
I like how people like you have turned this into a joke when it is literally the extent of the power these community reps have and the most responsible thing they can say since if they can't make any promises on behalf of the dev team on when something will actually be fixed.
---
Another possibility is a "clone" such that a weightless lever-action, for example, is not the same weapon as a normal lever-action. 
---
During the process of generating a legendary weapon, if it would receive the weightless affix, it becomes a separate weapon, with a different base weight, and mods with different +weight modifiers.
---
Just a little copy-pasting.
---
Explosive doesnt work well with sbq and can kill u real fast especially if bloodied. The ffr gives overall more dmg per min cause u shoot alot faster. Good drop tho still, would buy if u were on pc
---
+10% damage while aiming
---
90% reduced weight
---
Go into the atom store and reequip them.
---
I had a player (lvl 67?) drop a ton of plans in my camp. Waved and ran off. Nicest guy ever.
---
I‚Äôd never leave this team! Lol
---
They need to at least make it so you can collect the sulfur water, give it a condition bar that turns it into regular water to simulate the effect of the sulfur dissipating.
---
It‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like bloodied - it‚Äôs one thing to demolish every enemy you face without threat, it‚Äôs another to completely remove the already minimal role playing from the game.
---
Hear that bethesda??? It makes babies cry. Whoever's idea that thing was is a bad person üòÇ
---
&gt;1. Is there an inexpensive option for buying this game for the Xbox one? (Legal only). 
---
According to the MS store it's available on game pass in Canada
---
&gt;2. Is the game still a buggy nightmare
---
If you can tolerate the bugs in FO4 you'll be fine. Occasionally servers get laggy after a couple nukes have been dropped, but you can just server hop. 
---
&gt;3. Are micro transactions intrusive
---
Nope. Other than the useless scrap kits and a couple minor utility items like the collector bot for your camp, everything is cosmetic. 
---
You can buy atoms straight up if you want, but I'd recommend signing up for 1 month of FO 1st. It's $12 (maybe a bit more in CAD), but you get $16.50 worth of atoms as well as a couple free exclusive cosmetic items, access to private servers, a portable survival tent, and a scrap box that holds unlimited junk.
---
If your subscription expires you lose the tent and can't put anything else in the scrap box, but you still have access to everything you put into it. Lots of people sign up for a month, hoard massive amounts of junk, and then let the sub expire. It keeps your regular stash box from being overwhelmed with junk weight.
---
The more junk you can get the more storage space you'll need, so the FO1st scrap box sales would go up. It's a win for Bethesda imo.
---
I'm going to say this very slowly so you can understand.
---
Customer. Support. Is. A. Fucking. Call. Center.
---
They're not useless, they're doing the extent of what  they can do AS A FUCKING CALL CENTER.  Their entire job boils down to essentially two  tasks, reading responses to your inquiries from a database and sending reports to Bethesda.  This isn't the dedicated Fallout 76 direct hotline to the game devs, you're talking to at best someone working in a call center in some Bethesda office that covers all of their games and services and at worst someone in India that just finished talking someone through their microwaves warranty.
---
I think they should simply increase storage space, instead of having to find "creative ways" to get some. (bagspace instead of storage space, but then youcould drop some more into storage and emptying bagspace)
---
Thanks man
---
The moth man can spawn in a cultist area I forgot what‚Äôs it call but I‚Äôm sure you can look it up on yt and I‚Äôm not sure about sheepsquacth I‚Äôve always found them randomly
---
The only reason they are selling monthly subscriptions of Fallout 1st is by causing a weight problem and then selling a partial solution.
---
I doubt weight fixes are on their radar, but if they did this it could cause another weighty problem when people leave the team, so maybe?
---
Thinking about it, this is mainly for Fallout 1st subscribers, right?
---
I only ever get this kind of response from PvE players that die to me. Actual PvP players don't care if they die in a videogame where you lose basically nothing.
---
A witty response that is borderline perverted and vulgar. People reading do not know whether to upvote or downvote.
---
Fungi have a more recent common evolutionary ancestor with animals than to plants. So they fit more with the carnivore mutation over the herbivore mutation in that regard.
---
I hate how I put Uber damage into a mutie, for it To magically heal and save itself
---
Those who farmed the mole miner pails had a chance to get the plans, and I‚Äôm not sure if there has been any plan dupe since, but they are ‚Äúcommon‚Äù since a lot of people can make them.
---
I sell them in my vendor for 100 caps.(ps4)
---
TL;DR. (I'm just an idiot, not your fault.)
---
Stating the obvious is this: [these former BattleCry guys are oblivious to their original failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin). Bethesda swooped in and saved this dying studio whose experience consisted of MOBA-like freemium "gotcha!" and FOMO, as you mentioned.
---
Jeff Gardiner is running this ship like a MMO+MOBA+Mobile title, when it should be ran like a Fallout shooter-RPG *just with friends*.
---
We need somebody with not only genuine passion at the helm, but considerable and **SUCCESSFUL** experience too.
---
Thank u a high level gave them to me and was confused coz I had never seen them
---
Isn‚Äôt that what happened to the Legendary Mole Miners?
---
A Sheepsquatch always spawns at the end of Project Paradise, and Free Range.
---
It was advertised that we would be the raiders &amp; settlers. 
---
Then they made NPC raiders who aren't even a slight challenge. 
---
PvP is the only viable endgame for this game for anyone that wants any kind of challenge.
---
The outfits are not rare. The plans to make them are rare.
---
max lvl sheepsquatch is boss at Project Paradise.
---
Leader of the Pack pops up constantly and guarantees 3 legendary wolves. It takes 5 minutes at most. If you're high level you can also just hop from fissure to fissure, legendary scorchbeasts are fairly common.
---
I like you.
---
The PvP in this game is a blast. Would have never met the hundreds of players I've connected with over the past year without it.
---
bethesda owns you now
---
^^^ This
---
At the end of it they should just let us directly buy what we want individually, out of the stuff that we missed out on.
---
:( and I clicked play and my name is a bunch of random numbers and letters. Any idea why?
---
They still hurt a lot. Haha
---
Can often 1/2 tap bloody builds. Damage cap is 110. Some 110s hit harder than others tho cuz the damage numbers that show are prior to damage mitigation from one's build/armor.
---
not sure if it is time friendly, but the Raider Punk (rarely) gives a quest to kill a level appropriate sheepsquatch.
---
Whovians unite! &amp; yeah, the only cool dudes I‚Äôve met are the dudes who I haven‚Äôt used a mic with üò≠üò≠üò≠ but maybe there are some nice ones if I use it more often but I‚Äôm tired of hearing all the weirdos honestly
---
Stealth suit + melee is scary to fight if it is more than a 1v1. Lmao
---
Found him tonight in Cranberry Bog, west of Drop Site V9. A Diseased Legendary Sheetsquatch promptly attacked us, and Mr. Herder's cows immediately attacked *him*. Two Scorchbeasts promptly joined the fun. 
---
The resulting fight was epic, but I lost track of Mr Herder and his cows and I'm not sure if they survived the fight. Very good fun indeed!
---
I just picked up the game, waited for the steam sale and all that. I‚Äôm really enjoying it. I haven‚Äôt done PvP yet but will try it when I reach a high level. I feel like pvp adds a little bit more to the fallout world then just constantly fighting npcs.
---
It's because a account that doesn't have those emotes logged on to that system. Happens to me all the time.
---
That isn't a PvP player then. It's just a griefer.
---
That's awesome tho. Lmao
---
I came across a guy in a just a Grognak suit with no weapon when it was in the final 10. I shot at him a couple times but he kept running circles around me jumping and not even attacking. I thought it was hilarious so I just let him live. Usually when you find someone who's been hiding they make a break for it or make a halfway attempt at killing you but not this guy.
---
The weird part is how they followed you on your server hops.
---
Its almost like they are friends with a friend of yours and are purposely harassing you using your common friend to track you down...
---
gave you a random name/number. because they're jerks
---
It's possible you just re-entered the same world/server each time, and that's why they were still there.
---
While the chance is fairly low, it \*is\* possible to get put back onto the same server you just left.
---
Trap camps suck hahaha
---
As a person with OCD i totally understand you, maybe the coding to snapping to a grid is harder then we think.
---
I personally would love them to start by making camp building areas square or rectangular.
---
But I agree they should try to add grids to foundations, walls and roofs
---
Is there any way to do this?
---
Low levels can annihilate in this game. You just have to take time to learn how.
---
I have killed a level 650+ on a level 15 before.
---
and few seem to notice that Zorbo's ship is way wayyy ahead of us on the board. Wonder what happens if he beats players to the end. maybe nothing, probably nothing...
---
... or "Zorbo Wins!" debuff on our character forever, minus 10 to all states, permanently overencumbered (because of shame). Loss of all raider/settler rep, camp limit is limited to only camp box and 1 water pump, have to wear a Zorbo Wins! dunce camp at all times...
---
/s nah
---
Free range and it has 20 some.odd unique plans you can get from it.
---
If you could collect infinite purified waters from it, it'd be a little OP.
---
I've started leaving random caches of plans, healing, ammo, weapons etc for people ps4 tho
---
You can still get atoms from challenges you haven‚Äôt completed like the ‚Äúscrap 76 armor pieces‚Äù or whatever else. Just not for every daily. Your rant makes sense though. I see your point. I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt take this legendary run too seriously. I know I‚Äôm not. I skip days and have played other games.
---
wonder if it's better than the junkie fatman MIRV...
---
could be fun, or just shame
---
My big idea was to hide in the Pulowski Preservation shelter at the train station. Didn't turn out well.
---
I get that! I have only ever encountered male players, playing as female characters :( I've made so many friends but only one of them is female and she's super funny, met her server hoping :D
---
Honestly, I just wanted to bond with my boyfriend a little better, I got my PS4 really so I could play with him. But I like shooting games like cod, fortnite, apex, etc etc. &amp; he likes games that are basically stories &amp; also fighting games. So he won‚Äôt ever play with me. So I downloaded F76 so we could play and I eventually got hooked on it üò≠ you just gotta push her to play and she‚Äôll eventually like it.... maybe.
---
What u want in return
---
&gt;!Brenda needs Nukashine and Daddy-O?!?!&lt; what fresh hell is this....
---
(Lucille intensifies)
---
Whats ffr? What star and what lvl
---
We should be able to connect it to a water pump outside and then be able to dispense purified water to the limit of the purifier/s outside, and after that dirty water
---
Then let‚Äôs play! I‚Äôm shy myself so we don‚Äôt have to talk, until you want to if ever! it could just be us doing missions together &amp; helping each other out. But if you are on a higher level I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be much help lol! I‚Äôll be there to support you tho! I will message you my psn!
---
gta griefers making their way to fallout
---
[edit: thanks todd]
---
In terms of interesting dailies or events: One Violent Night is a fun one to do even though it's basically a wave defense with music; Monster Mash is pretty funny and if you can find someone to PvP it with you properly it can be a real blast; Heart of the Swamp is the only place to fight the strangler heart now that the raids are gone; messenger and census violence are worth doing a few times for the robot dialog and the whole Encryptid quest line is a lot of fun.
---
I play mostly nuclear winter, and even in that mode it's not uncommon to find women playing. They just usually hang back until they're sure the group wont be absolute chodes when they hear a woman's voice.
---
All in all, seems like 76 has about the same female proportions in the playerbase as say EVE; which is more than WoW, but less than FFXIV.
---
It's worth noting that you don't get T notes if you haven't done the Wastelanders quests
---
obviously sarcastic comment
---
Yeah and then why would anyone buy scrap kits?
---
Bloodied 25% faster fire rate 2 star lvl 50 and for 6k not 7
---
Cool place ya got there.
---
This isn't true. She has 35k hp to start and then regens half of that for a total of 52.5k, and there's nothing in the files about her gaining more hp with more people.
---
Flatwood Monster "invasions" becoming more common...
---
damn synths
---
yes
---
Dodgy, Ricochet(when it procs, you take zero damage), Serendipity, full uny/ap/sent set, nerd rage, blocker, fireproof, lone wanderer when solo, bodyguards when in a group. Only thing that kills me is poison from the queen/mirelurk kings/queens.
---
I tried to just tag Nia the Camp Counselor and then let everyone else get their hits in, but then she started chasing me and beating my ass.
---
I know you have already given up, but the only realistic way would be having a friend stack fo1st tents for you. 
---
The other one would be moving your camp nearby and make most possible ladders and then jetpack from there.
---
If you are on ps4 and need screws hit me up sometime.
---
i can see bethesda making a new ammo, only obtainable from ammo converter...
---
...then they'll add an ultracite version that somehow requires the normal ammo, so double crafting time and effort... meh, probably not
---
I‚Äôve seen videos online with gamers who have 100 for all SPECIAL
---
I'll hit that point within the week, so that's really good to know.  
---
Guess I'll have to burn some bars on something.
---
not sure, probably worth looking into...
---
... would suck to have ADG113456733 as your in game name forever
---
Does this currently work(stacking them 100%longer chem fiend and biocomm 50%longer)?
---
Tenderiser is a hidden beast boyos
---
Is this a quest line
---
I'm on ps4 happy to party up with you. I'm: Snazzzah. Add me and we can chill! :)
---
I'd love it. More carry weight is always appreciated and we'd likely see more people play in groups which would be nice . I reckon the rest of the public teams would be abandoned though.
---

---
Open to offers. Stable yellow cake if you got it.
---
Modders were able to add snapping to new settlement objects in Fallout 4, so it's something doable in the toolset and a process that is completely known.
---
I know a 50 something year old friend of my parents who is obsessed with it. She bought it for me and got me to play it, not to mention giving me a boost at earlier levels which really helped me. This proves that both women and older generations play games like this. Also, what platform?
---
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by ‚Äúbuffy.‚Äù
---
They should have a commie wacker NW mode. The only weapon available inthat session.
---
Um... pvp players (before the newest update that removed team aggros) would fight 4v4v4+ all the time just fine.
---
I feel you.
---
Not the og poster but I have a similar build. 15 strength base, radicool, unyielding, and whiskey+alcoholic perk. Add in deep-pocketed and backpack and you can hit 500 carry weight easily. To min-max some more we can apparently add the pepperoni roll+carnivore and a +1 stranth legendary wep. I don't even have full unyeilding or a fully upgraded backpack.
---
My character has turned into a packrat build. all of my strength is used with 90% weight reduction perks as well as almost all the other weight reduction perks on the other SPECIAL slots as well.
---
It's more 'efficient' to keep everything on my character but weapons, armor, and misc. objects.
---
It‚Äôs pretty dull. I find myself saying to my friend ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything else now, I‚Äôve nearly levelled up and I need to wait for tomorrow else I‚Äôll miss that level up challenge‚Äù. 
---
Like, how ridiculous is that? They‚Äôve create a system where playing it is a chore, and you‚Äôre half-forced to stop playing because you‚Äôll miss out the next day.
---
there was some card game (caravan) in fallout NV, so it's not totally unrealistic. though it was more a basic deck (hearts, clubs, etc) for gambling, so maybe
---
It has bugs, it has microtransactions, it's laggy too. Toughen up yourself to them or pass. 
---
A friend got a physical copy off of gamefly for $2 if you don't have Xbox game pass. This was 6 months ago though.
---
#1 explosive damage really doesn‚Äôt affect the queen
---
#2 faster fire rate on the queen is better than explo
---
#3 Prime will always give a DMG boost on the queen
---
Absolutely
---
Which would be why people are upset that they nerfed PvP so heavily. The PvE updates aren't enough for endgame PvP players. Wastelanders brought ZERO challenges with it - besides making PvP players either leave the game or get creative/learn patience to manage team fights.
---
Yep couldnt agree more. I didnt mins grinding daily for 50 or 60 stoms and saving for something i really wanted to pick out, but now i have to play longer to get scrap kits i wont use, weapon skins i wont use and a few pieces of predetermined camp items and like a quarter of the atoms we used to get?
---
Why does this feel more like a punishment than anything else. 
---
They should have left challenges alone, and added this in with its own unique challenges or tied it into leveling up or something. But as is it sucks.
---
I have the insurgent plan and usually drop the outfits for whoever comes in my camp
---
(looks towards horizon, raises fist)
---
"HazMaaaaaaaaat"
---
I do the same thing. It's like they're actively reinforcing our impulse to not play.
---
Everyone is playing on their lowest rank character in NW for the level up challenge. I have several high rank builds but today I played with my rank 5.
---
The only thing remotely pay to play/win in the game is the scrap box you get with fo1 playing with it and without it are night and day to me since I'm a border and grab everything I see. But if a little bit of occasional inventory management isn't an issue you can easily buy the game and never spend a cent more on it.
---
Upvoting for name that fits
---
Different strokes, I suppose. I like my current play style but trying something new is always fun for me.
---
Giving this game a chance but man - after installation it kept asking me to 'switch profiles' , once I restarted I get this noreigonping issue. Hot trash
---
Wow, I‚Äôve never baked the forest before but looking at all that cobalt flux makes me want to
---
It used to bother me as well, but think about it like this:
---
If everybody was mindful and sympathetic towards you, you would have such a breeze through the game. You would stop caring. Having dumb and selfish people around is just another layer of difficulty for the game. It makes you appreciate the good people you meet from time to time.
---
grinding for atoms were better that‚Äôs for sure, and they need to upgrade CAMP items in atomic shop more and people would spend atoms way way more often
---
They know about this, it's just that they're slow AF when it comes to fixing things. For example, how long has VATS been bugged? Ages. How long have gauss pistol (shotgun too?) been bugged? Since the release of Wastelanders. Yes, these are hard times, working from home etc. but some things I simply can't understand.
---
Best idea I've read in a while, especially considering the scarcity of said ingredients.
---
I'm not new. I'm level 180 with my main, and 80-something with my alt, and I don't even know what's going on. I've read about this event. I've tried to play it the way I've read about it. I go in with my shotgun crippling the ghouls like I assume you're supposed to, but then every other Yahoo in the group just comes behind me and finishes them off. I don't know where the ore is, because I haven't played it often enough to find out. I'm just lost.
---
Yes if you know he won‚Äôt screw you over. SS armor is the best and you can‚Äôt trade that. It‚Äôs easy to get too
---
With a Geiger counter in my hand
---
Ignore this post. I thought I was replying to a post about radiation rumble. I'm wrong, and an idiot.
---
Find a server with a lot of event teams with high levels
---
I barely meet people that use the mic, guess everyone's shy, let alone women. Not a single one in the 4 months I'm playing. My wife was wondering the same thing.
---
Oh yeah.   And married couples too.  Try a guild :).  Old Timers Guild is great and they have chapters in most every game.
---
Okay. So many weapons and armor mods fall into three categories 1.) Learn by scrapping, 2.) Buying from vendors/Finding in World, 3.) Rare Plan. (Rare Plans are plans that only drop from hyper-specific sources whether being an enemy type or a region event drop.) 
---
For example it took a bloody year for me to get all the mods for the Baseball Bat. I even got two of the three colored bats before my last plan drop. If you are scrapping a non-armor puece or a Radium Rifle and just not learning new mods you might have a buy only or a rare plan.
---
You can‚Äôt judge avatar graphics.  I almost always get guy characters and my hubby almost always girls.   I guess what kind of animated butt do you wanna look at for fifty levels?  Lol.
---
But u asked for our opinion, its not maximized. You have utility and qol perks instead of dmg. Thid build might not suck for you playing rn but its a big downgrade from the builds that many people run. This in the nicest way possible is a foodbuild.
---
the games not that broken. I started a month ago and beat the main story it‚Äôs not horribly unplayable had maybe two glitches that fixed upon resetting the game. the most obvious problems are endgame which you haven‚Äôt experienced
---
Cap, aint no lvl 500 askin dumb questions like this and defendin food builds unless troll
---
Carnivore + Strange in Numbers + pepperoni roll = +75 carry weight. If you lost a team mate while waddling over to a stash box you'd lose your buff and it would make for a bad time.
---
The damage output is why it‚Äôs so popular. When you gain 100% more damage at 10% health no other build comes close to that, it‚Äôs pure carnage. It‚Äôs not for everyone since you need sentenal and unyielding gear to make the most of bloodied builds so you don‚Äôt die from a single shot. once you go bloodied you can never go back!
---
Nice
---
This is probably the wrong place to ask this, but you mentioned the carnivore mutation. Does it affect canned dog food at all? I would really like to get that mutation, but dog food is currently my primary food source, and I don't want to screw things up for myself.
---
Btw how do u get gold bullion? I always wondered. Do u have to beat the overseer quest line or something? Also when do the vendors show up where you can trade it in?
---
I've come across a few gals on comms so there must be plenty more that play and don't say anything.
---
got my used copy at gamestop for ten bucks
---
You don‚Äôt have to side with foundation. Just have to progress in their story line. You can go pretty far with both factions. Just until ‚Äúside with crater‚Äù or ‚Äúside with foundation.
---
Its likely they have reduced fall damage on the limbs and probably bird bones mutations probably also running serendipity (luck tree) to avoid most instances of death üëç
---
Same with falling into a fissure right after killing the sbq. I know that feel man, it sucks ASS.
---
But to answer your question directly, once you run out of AP, if you fall from too get a height, you will take damage
---
Yep, i See it like you, i mean when they change it like they announced with 100k cPacity and x100 converting volume it will be even Better, but it isnt as bad now as everyone says its just alot of These " but i ordered my breakfast with the egg on the left side of the Plate Not the right, i want to speak to the Manager" guys
---
If you just press back after you succesfully converted your desired ammo type you get back to the Menu where you can chose what ammo to convert saving you two screens, then its really fast.
---
It is all in your timing. I've watched a friend slam into the ground and need a stimpack revive and other times he can trigger his jetpack at the right moment to take no damage.
---
I play with my husband. He introduced me to games when we started dating. I am super picky about what games I'll play though. So I got lucky he liked the exact games that I would like.
---
Oh my, I‚Äôve read about people like you, but never come across one in the wild. The gnomes are trying to bring civilization to this barren land, your bears are trying to keep it as savage as ever! 
---
I‚Äôll see the shattering of no more gnomes, None! Good day!
---
Why not just strength?
---
Does that plus more, and makes way more sense.
---
Scavenger would be intelligence, which is already the building group.
---
Could call it Backpacking, Hiking, or even something like Baseball Practice.
---
If you're on PS4, there's a Facebook group called Wasteland Wenches. It's an all female community. I'm a guy, but my sister is a member, and through her I've met a lot of cool players. Really good group of ladies.
---
Yeesh, it‚Äôs bad enough running wires through the camp. Could you imagine trying to run plumbing? That would be a nightmare.
---
you can also hold the exit button to just leave the converter screen immediately. different on each system, ps4 i think is the circle button. 
---
...but converting 1800 .38 ammo to 2000 points is quite tedious right now. (button spam for five minutes, check total, spam resumes)
---
Caravan is awesome I have the real cards, they are normal cards from different decks, it happens something like the caps, they are no longer produced and become rare items. They can add different rarity for the different decks and the system is already working in NV and NV is being remastered so let's pray for it
---
I love when distant thunder pops up and you get to slaughter everything in a matter of seconds. I also manage to kill myself with it pretty often.
---
I had to restart the game.
---
You sir, are a hero! You saved me so much headache... I was actually looking at cloning my c: to my game drive as I don't have enough space on c to move the game to. Then along came yourself and saved the day! Thanks a bunch!
---
As a Not yet due to Lack of fluxes jetpack User my Question now would be Do the Action points Start to refill after you used them all in air while flying/falling?
---
If So then it would be really cool cause you could trigger the jetpack before slaming the ground and negate any damage then. Or Do they Start to refill only after you had contact with the ground again?
---
Wall of text. Off topic.
---
(smiley begins card game for bullion gambling)
---
I'll reserve judgement on it until the end of the season, but yeah, it definitely could use improving. They should do challenges the same way Fortnite does, where you can go back and do ones you havent completed yet if you wanna try and grind the whole pass in a day or 2.
---
Why not increase strenght instead of carryweight? Seems to fit next to the other "special" teams. Plus next to increased carryweight you will also get increased melee damage üòÅ Wouldnt that be lovely?
---
I've experienced the endgame. Correction. I've experienced the complete lack of an endgame. I've also put up with every glitch they've had for over a year and a half ish now. The lack of duping fixes. The lack of hacking fixes. The never fixed dragon AI in scorchbeasts that makes them never land and the actual game breaking bugs that span both gamemodes, the half thousand small bugs that pester everything if you look hard enough. A month is not enough time to watch the seams fray. Fuck, the fact that a level fifty Mr gutsy can two shot a t-51 clad level 80. There's a lot of small things that just make this a sad state, especially in comparison to other similar games. There are still bugs that have carried on from four. It's not that there's some handful of absolutely game breaking bugs but the quantity of small ones.
---
Is this a power armor mod or just a jetpack?
---
Yeah for me its the limit of 2000 that hurts the most cause i play clash royale while Pressing the Buttons so that i dont even notice how often i have to press them. But the 2k limit is reached so fast that i cant concentrate on the one nor the other 100%. Otherwise it would be like afk farming the points haha
---
What day we on now so I can check
---
Maybe they've decided that in the long run they want to shut this down so they don't have to keep paying for it.
---
So they're trying to drive down the numbers so they have an excuse to say "see numbers are down, we're gonna close now"
---
"Grab the money, and run."
---
Really? About damn time! Wonder if that'll include shared XP between Team members, too...? I might have to try and drag my friends back in if it does!
---
Yes please. I got a 90% reduced weight minigun with the standard barrel, switched it out for the tri barrel and bam, my 3 pound minigun turned in an 18 pound minigun.
---
I was not happy. :(
---
Twitch name?
---
I'm curious about RNG percent per item.
---
(It is! And a pretty cool one at that!)
---
Bethesda won‚Äôt mess with the carry weight, it earns them real world money from FO1st
---
I got My copy on disk for about 5Euros . 
---
Game is still buggy . Sometimes you get game breaking bugs .
---
Micros are almost only cosmetics and camp items . Besides the repair kits . But you can get those elsewhere.
---
It's not a magic gun. It has to be either Junkie's or Instigating or Stalker's or have second effect with 33% VATS or 40% bash or 50% limb damage. Secondary explosive counts as extra hit, so kinda "doubles" the effective fire rate for the bug. 
---
Even the 200+ fire rate is not needed. It just needs to be close to 200. The higher the fire rate, the easier the effect triggers.
---
For example a vampire limb damage LMG is a magic gun, even though it has fire rate 159.
---
Ive encountered mothman like 4 Times in the very south of savage devide in the Spot where you can build your Camp to extract both lead and acid at the same time, there is no marker for this on the map but i guess most Players will know what im talking about.
---
Exactly I've been advising ppl to make new characters. Easy to get the daily done.
---
Yah, once you get the back button trick, it goes rather ok. Eager for the update for sure.
---
Just join a building team, then go do your own thing  everyone one there is just gaining extra xp with no expectation to do events per se
---
danielkilsbyyyy,   I don't really stream, I just had some people from xbox wanting to see
---
Sometimes when using my pipboy indoors it'll be barely visible because of obnoxious lighting,  kinda like using a smartphone in bright sunshine
---
That why I went stealth commando and just one shot everything before they even can react.
---
Might as well add me too GT: BeefClotLoaf Age :30
---
If you dislike shouting and are a chill human . Hook me up üòÅ
---
Not a fan of it but it was free. I leave it out for people that visit my camp to use. Is just a grueling process to convert all the ammo not used into the ammo used and still only get a fraction of what you put in converted into what you need. I go through a few thousand 5.56 &amp; fusion cells a day. 
---
I.E. 60x .45 gives enough points to get 20x 5.56. The ArmCo machine caps off at 200x 5.56 but it does produce that amount within an hour. Though using it to craft fusion cells is completely pointless. After playing the game on my private server for 8 hours, I'll only get 147 fusion cells from it max. Even though it is supposed to craft 200 in just under 5 hours. 
---
I drop off all the ammo I don't use to friends that do use it and the rest is left at a random train station. I go around all the missle silos, university vault and monorail elevator to collect the lead weights then hit up lucky hole mine. That gives me enough lead to craft what I use daily. Plus I get XP for all the kills along the way and ammo crafting. No XP for converting ammo.
---
what has this game done to fallout
---
I had a bloodied 90% less weight dunno what third Star was but it went into the shredder i thought noone was playing that Thing
---
To a visiting player: WHAT ARE YOU AN IGUANA BIT SANDWICH
---
You can add me to on xbox: PimPandoer
---
Oh? I also noticed Julie on the radio has new lines. 
---
Time to go back to Camdem then
---
If it continues,  write down their names and then exit the game. Go to friends and search friends, type that name in, from there you can block them . (Playstation) I'm sure xbox has similar.
---
Good luck ,I hope idiots like this dont ruin the game for you.
---
Have you ever put a mod on a rw weapon? It gets super heavy again. A rw mini gun with a tri barrel still weights like 16. The rw dose not apply to mods so it kinda stinks
---
Make sure to switch to an event if the queen comes online . 4x event exp om queen is quite tasty üòÅ
---
Unless you have your perk cards setup correctly and the right armor to match for that build, no gun is a 'magic gun'. I've watched 8 friends all with a combination of different legacy weapons attempt to take down the SBQ and fail. They go in thinking they can shred the SBQ like we all have seem some people do in several seconds then question why it didn't work. The people shredding her are people that take the time to setup their character build correctly.
---
You get Bullion after you do the quest involving the raid on Vault 79 as part of the Wastelanders faction quests. Once you get far enough into either the Raiders (Raiders FTW) or Settlers quests you will end up there.
---
Once you are done there will be a Bullion vendor called Regs in Vault 79 and also vendors in Crater and Foundation.
---
Regs has all of the Secret Service armor and mods available as well as the rare power armor sets from the start but to get the most from the faction vendors ... ... well, welcome to the grind my friend.
---
After you finish the Vault 79 quest line every time you do certain daily and public events you will get Treasury Notes which can be exchanged at the Gold Bullion machines.
---
Also. The SBQ is pretty much immune to explosive effects so that particular weapon is not idea. Get a limb damage FFR something.
---
Your best bet is to get two Acrobats legendaries for full fall damage immunity. No other combination of fall damage reduction perks/mods/mutations will save you from extreme falls. If you're going to use the jetpack you might as well go all the way with it. Too much of a pain in the ass in my opinion to try and time jumps (which is completely unreliable in this buggy engine) or deal with dying because I got shot a mile into the air during the SBQ or something.
---
And they added a bunch of new atom challenges with patch 20. Nobody seems to mention that.
---
That would be really cool, to be able to collect the whitesprings suffer water. It's so well placed its like a little pit stop between getting slapped silly by ghouls
---
I‚Äôve been picking up ammo at train stations instead of dropping them and loving missiles :)
---
Lol exactly
---
And the song playing from a physical radio is not the same as from your pip-boy.
---
I have a portapotty behind my camp, it's on a downward slope, since I'm unable to dig a drainage ditch I'll have to hope gravity is enough..
---
True. But it'd still be so gamebreaking that it may not be worth it for them.
---
read it like you put it down for a year...
---
Evasive Perk in Agility, for sure.
---
My god really? I've never seen anyone go over 450. Or around that anyway
---
Getting 100 weight for being on a 4-man team? That's really pushing it. As bad as it sounds, carry weight has always been the mechanic in this. The more *things* that exist in each server lag us out. It f'n sucks, but adding more things definitely won't work. The servers can't process it. I lag out to hell just accessing my stash in a public server. At BEST we'd get 2 lbs per teammate, 8 total.
---
Half the time
---
Wheres the location?
---
Unyielding + high Capacity backpack mod and perk cards :-) it‚Äôs kinda sad I have more carry weight than my excav PA
---
I dropped it for like three or four months at max
---
Lol yeah that's what happened to me too with ballistic fiber
---
Barbarian (Strength), Ironclad (Endurance), and Evasive (Agility) will all work.
---
What perk do I add to get rid of the lag when trying to quick change weapons?
---
Im relatively sure the levels don't do anything
---
That sounds pretty useful tbf.
---
I‚Äôd probably wish for a Trader public team, with bonuses to caps gained from selling to NPC traders (stack with Hard Bargain perk) and rewards from dailies. (Like a small increase in caps gained, like 10% extra caps)
---
No more fast traveling to people‚Äôs bases and wasting caps when you know that public team is down for some trades.
---
No one knows.
---
Different durability, crafting and repair cost.
---
Sounds about right
---
I jumped from Xbox 360 to PS4 and the only thing I want is State Of Decay 2. The first one was amazing.
---
But why make a higher level that costs more? Higher durability?
---
I know this just went to Gamepass, so there should be an abundance of new players right? Yesterday and today I spent a few hours server hopping looking for a specific armor limb on players vendors. Every world was dead, except for one. No one was running events, barely any camps on the maps, no SBQ event. Haven't seen it this dead in a looong time. Dunno if I was just extremely unlucky or what.
---
If you have x2 50% reduced fall damage legendary effect armor pieces you won't take any fall damage at all.
---
Those 'random numbers' are your **Steam ID** which is a 17-digit number unique to you. You could always try changing your Player name though since the Steam ID is permanently set in stone.
---
Femme that voice chats here: far, \*far\* less than in other games, but it does happen.
---
What exactly did they add? Because it looks like the only ones I have left are the ones that require over 1k kills, or over 1k repairs, etc. The rest are NW card pack reward ones.
---
Okay, so first, username checks out (haha, sorry). Anyways, guy here. If you're on Xbox, I can help on your missions. I'm a level 205 &amp; don't worry, I'm not overpowered. I can mod armor &amp; weapons for ya if you want. My GT is same as username.
---
If you really are female, I would advise not posting your PS4 handle. You're likely to get a lot of unwanted attention.
---
Near vault 96 right? My camp is actually down there. The Vengeful Mothman red/yellow variant appears there 3x daily. I'm looking for the Glowing Mothman green level 75 variant. Its the only one for an atom challenge I need to complete it. Been searching for over a year now.
---
It will be normal as power armour negates fall damage.
---
I just solo it if nobody shows ( which almost never happens because at least 1 or 2 usually stroll in ). It takes a little longer but it‚Äôs doable at the right level with the right build.
---
More weeklies this week too
---
Does limb damage effect do anything on the SBQ because you can't cripple her anymore.
---
Well it‚Äôs weird because my girlfriend is on steam but it‚Äôs showing her steam name, not the numbers
---
And how do I change my player name?
---
Now that's bullshit. I also hate missing on exp during events but just standing there and afk and getting all the credit is lame
---
I loved the original 
---
I hate the new one
---
Bethesda add a playlist that allows us to choose what songs we want to play
---
I don't think Legacy weapons can be magic. But a stalker limb damage lmg can melt her in under a minute
---
Im using the ultracite gatling laser. Ive got about 40 0% fusion cores because they just sit in my inventory and don't disappear. My power armor dosent eat them for some reason.
---
Yes! The NW one was meh, but god damn that original intro brings me to tears.
---
Thats exactly what the problem is excavator was nice in the beginning of the game but now im getting more legendary armor and good backpacks
---
Been playing it since launch, got over 200m cash and everything you can buy.
---
I only keep bunkers and nightclub active wich still make me couple million a day wit minimal effort.
---
Nostalgia
---
The worse type of grind is a capped one for a fully paid game. This is not a f2p game like candy crush that limits your total plays. It does nothing but piss off the player bases. Payed grind should always be at your leisure.
---
Or medics. And as explosive counts as a separate tick of damage it effectively doubles rof on weapons. But the queen is immune to it so in this specific example it's moot.
---
It bugs the weapon damage which is all that you need
---
My mask lost the plants with wastelanders somehow
---
I feel like the only impact this would even have on the game would be how many weapons and mods you can actually carry. If you have fallout first then allocating storage space for scrap is a thing of the past, and if you don‚Äôt have fallout first then having the 500 carry weight would be amazing for you, no longer would you need 300lbs spare in your stash just for scrap. Plz Bethesda this change would be amazing, bummer when you‚Äôre at 498/500 and someone leaves the squad tho lmao
---
Weird. The guy I saw in Rad Rumble around ago had a fern leaf on his forehead. I'm on Xbox, if that matters?
---
Not by itself. It does however trigger a damage bug on high fire rate weapons, causing them to do way more damage than you'd expect looking at the card. It's still good to have a good base damage as the bugged effect is multiplying that. 
---
Once I killed her with ~150 bullets on my Junkie's minigun... You can also find clips on YouTube where a single LMG clip (75 bullets) takes her out...
---
GTA5 does monetization right, it's easy to make money even for a average player. 
---
GTA5 recieves 2 major updates every year for the past 7 years it's been released. Atleast the money spend on optional shark cards are beeing used for development.
---
Bethesda got a MTX store with outrages prices, a subscription that is somewhat a must have with the scrapbox and survival tent.
---
Bethesda releases updates with the majority of content added to the MTX store, wich as of late atoms became a exclusive currency only obtained for buying or extremely limited amounts from the season system wich also is build for you to spend atoms as a average player.
---
GTA5 doesn't have time limited stores or premium currency, if you want to quickly get a few mill for some things you can. But the majority of GTA5 players can easily earn a few million a day.
---
Yes omg yes, I dont fight the queen without it
---
Is that actually a thing?
---
Might be the difference between purchased mask and acquired mask from the raid. I play on Xbox and up until wastelanders release my mask had foliage on it but now it has lost it, I haven‚Äôt yet bought the plans to craft it though so can‚Äôt confirm if the crafted mask has foliage or not, could just be my mask is bugged
---
Are you sure Medic's is one of them? The Angry Turtle video for solo ISS had a secondary effect magic (33% VATS) on his Medic's shotgun. 
---
And the Queen is not immune just very resistant to explosions. Though in her case, as you've said, the very minor explosion somehow doesn't help triggering the bugged damage.
---
Don't pick them up? Or pick them up and leave as gifts at your camp? Or somewhere at a vendor?
---
I'm in the same boat... I find way more legendaries than I can sell for scrip / caps. So I just give them out or leave them around in places...
---
You are not supposed to progress faster. Part of the grind mechanics.
---
Well I‚Äôm not trying to be that guy but yeah mine tops out at 14
---
Thanks, for the reply. So what would the ultimate gun be? I,J or S, E lmg ?or would a B 33%, 40% OR 50% do better?
---
They‚Äôre all so awful though that no one would want them üòÜ
---
Put them in your vendor for 15 caps a point. They will sell in minutes. Clearly overpricing them off u can‚Äôt sell them
---
Maybe for their own scrip / caps limit? :)
---
Or my favourite dying, respawning map showing only   the vault as the only respawn location as you are overcumbered even though you have all those perks and backpack mods
---
Calibrated shocks and hydraulic bracers I believe,
---
‚ÄúDuping won‚Äôt get anyone banned.‚Äù Said just hours before the ban wave for duping went into effect. So like I said days ago, violate terms of service and se what ya get. Multi million dollar companies don‚Äôt give a damn about you or your premium subscription. Here‚Äôs a crazy idea though, just play the damn game and quit trying to break it. Too much to ask?
---
Funny how you notice that and not the fact that your character‚Äôs hand clips through the barrel and that the reload animations are wrong
---
Instead of giving us a million similes and metaphors, why not give a few examples of what disappointed you about this game, after returning from your hiatus?
---
Like kill 76 aquatic creature, kill 76 bugs, etc.
---
My biggest complaint is leveling up being a daily requirement. I'm only in the 130s and it takes a while to level up. I can't imagine 500 or 600+ characters.
---
I'm not saying there arent any problems with the design of this game, but it also sounds like a problem on your end? I mean, I do have my weekly dose of stress too, but after that I boot up a game during the weekend to have fun and don't really care if I can get it all.
---
Low level tesla, tags everything and you get that ammo everywhere ;) just watch out at normal events as some gits will get tagged too if in range and they will try and kill you for junk and caps
---
The SINK  is clean, right? Not the underground pipe system, nor the underground watersource.
---
1) A lot of the radiant or daily quests have randomized rewards, so its quite hard to predict what you'll get, though it will generally be at a level equal to the recommended level of the quest. You can improve the odds of certain weapons dropping by knowing its blueprint, but not by much.
---
2) Shotguns benefit moreso from a lot of the perks in the Strength group, and a few perks in the Perception group. Charisma is mostly for team play, Agility moreso for Stealth play (a Stealth Shotgun build is pretty viable though), and Luck is moreso for resources and random stuff.
---
3) Doing the Main Quests till you get the Foundation/Crater dailies so you can start earning reputation is worthwhile. Its also worth working towards the heist so you can unlock the endgame shotgun - the Gauss Shotgun.
---
You will just have to deconstruct some for mod plans. Maybe buy a blueprint for one or look up where they drop if they ever do.
---
We want answers...
---
Just started playing again recently and traded a fixer I got, back into the scrip machine since I already have my legacy.s/
---
Worked for me! Thank you.
---
It should in theory but since cav is chance based now it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to actually test
---
One thing I really want the terminal to do is to connect to modus and allow me to initiate search and destroy without having to go all the way to the bunker and a few load screens. Hopefully with brotherhood coming out later on a new ally wink wink bethesda
---
Bethe$$$da : No.
---
I don't have any legacies at all tbh. Even now with all this going on.
---
No! Bethesda worked hard enough on that FREE content and you should be satisfied. This is the worse complaint I've seen since you all decided to complain about the free red rocket poster. Stop playing if you are gonna be this entitled!
---
I just go on my low level alt
---
You‚Äôd still need a water purifier lol it doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòClean sink with built in Water Purifier‚Äô does it?
---
The one that I earned from actually doing the raids lost its plants with wastelanders, which is annoying because that‚Äôs what I actually liked about it
---
Junkie's FFR (LMG or Minigun). Junkie's explosive for anything else. Energy weapons don't work so well on SBQ (I have a JFFR gatling laser - the "melting" is a lot slower). 
---
Instigating is great on shotguns. But anything magical is amazing on them inside VATS (there seems to be an extra damage bug with them in VATS). I have a vampire's bash lvl40 combat shotgun and that thing is so good for farming. One-shots most everything in VATS with zero shotgun perks and heals me constantly. I also have an Instigating gauss shotgun and that thing wrecks everything even outside of VATS without any perks. It's stupidly broken. 
---
But for longer fights... Anything magical which is ballistic... I have a lvl35 Hunter's 33% VATS minigun I use on Scorchbeasts (since my Junkie's minigun is primed and I don't want to waste ultracite ammo) and they drop like flies as well...
---
Also... The higher server lag, the harder to get the effect somehow... At least in my experience...
---
OP is talking about the jetpack mod for the SS armor, so no PA.
---
Do you go to the event and wait? Also I believe if you crouch or are stealthed you dont show on the map. So others may not go if they see nobody there. 
---
Join a higher lever events team and do the come here emote. Xbone is popping these days. Soooooo many new players.
---
1. XBOX Gamepass or a Used Physical Copy
---
2. It has some bugs, nothing game-breaking, some frustrating but all bearable (My experience as a PC player, Console bugs may vary, but as far as I know both versions have the same bugs). TL;DR, Not as buggy as before, the Wastelanders update seems to have fixed a major portion of this game.
---
3. No. Most, if not all microtransactions are purely cosmetic with the exception of Fallout 1st, but it really just gives you some cosmetics, emotes and unlimited Junk storage, which doesn't give any real game-breaking advantages.
---
Constructive criticism: I bought this game for sale (19.99$) on PC very recently and I've sunk about 165 hours into it in about a little over a week. My buddy and I both decided to purchase it together, as we heard that the Wastelanders update changed the game for the better, (which it has), and decided to give it a shot, and we love it. It's an amazing game, and after the Wastelanders update, deserves more praise than it receives. There are many negative opinions, but you should try the game in order to be able to form an opinion for yourself. The XBOX Gamepass is about 4.99$/mo. and it would be a great way to experience the game before purchasing it for yourself.
---
Love that idea. Not sure if the modules could somehow be duped though. I bet there's a method, but it's not visible yet. Who knows. It would still be better than the rng.
---
Most people get around this by making a quick level 1 and then finishing those with it.  Also yeeeea - I was 400 something when I started the grind and finished at 600 something.   Def shoots you up there.
---
I can put one (or two) in your camp if you want.
---
Thanks for taking your time to reply. Have a good Sunday broski.
---
Wahoo plenty of time to put my charger on and make a cuppa ;)
---
That issue has been fixed in patch 20
---
Wait, gamebreaking isn't the Bethesda way?
---
unfortunately no, there aren't any legendary effects for power armour
---
I mean they don't do it on purpose. They just seem to not do enough testing of combonations
---
A Mothman festival? Pretty sure the cultists don't share with "non-believers".  
---
Maybe a cultist hunt, that ends with spartan kicking a high ranking cultist of a cliff,  
---
"This .. Is ... Appalachia!"
---
I am the same. I one shot most everything. Why would I need to do more damage.
---
I sincerely doubt this game is capable of something like that without severely messing up a bunch of other things
---
Terrible idea, no. 
---
People do server hopps so often, that my team is constantly switching from 2-4 and disabling/enabling buffs.
---
Not until buffs stay for some time when someone leaves or remove server hopping.
---
The UI is poor but nowhere as bad as the total disaster many made it out to be. I actually find it fairly simple and only the lack of a 'max convert' option slows me down.
---
I think many people simply love to be haters and jumped on the bandwagon just as they do with each and every glitch and issue regardless of severity. If they hate the game that much why not save the stress and simply don't play it!
---
Pointless guide. Everyone does those things anyway. 1/10 wouldnt read again.
---
200% yes, its easy enough to get 6k and even though its a lowish amount its just extra gold for minimal effort
---
Only time I did it was when I was about to cap out again on caps and had already bought everything I remotely wanted.  Over half the time I don't even bother turning in treasury notes.  None of the gold rewards are really worth anything to me.
---
Why not get a forest scout mask? Same thing without the shrubbery :-)
---
I understood bottom text More than the words you used
---
Are pc players just dicks or what? Always seems to be on pc. Whats going on over there?
---
I know that and was trying to make a snarky comment. To be honest 76 has been my favorite experience since NV, I first played on the PS4 at launch and honestly could not play it, gave it a chance back in March when Covid hit before Wastelanders and fell in love with it
---
Pretty sure. I used cranberry relish on my carnivore and herbivore characters today. It gave 10%xp to both of them. Played each one about 2 hours each.
---
I made the relish yesterday and was going to transfer it to my herbivore character, but it said I could use it so I ate it 3 times, it said it was working every time. ü§î
---
Think the only thing you cant get is the opposite of the food mutation you first get.  Carnivore or Herbivore.  There is practically no harsh downside to getting them all.  Hell, with public teams and being able to make one with just yourself in it and still benefitting from team modifiers even the ones solo players avoided are now viable.
---
Yes to grind gold efficiently you need to do minor public events and they award 20 gold bars.
---
So buying 600 gold is like autocompleting 30 of those events like tea time and swarm of suitors. 
---
That's a lot of time saved, and that's not even considering the time-gated nature of converting notes to gold.
---
I just got first for one month but im not 100% sure of this. Can i just stock a lot of junk in scrap box and when my sub will end i will still have Access to that junk?
---
Wait to do mayor for the day( i think that‚Äôs what the quest is called) in watoga. You get a super sledge called all rise with 90% reduced weight and +10health
---
You can have almost all of them. The only two you can't have simultaneously are herbivore and carnivore as they directly conflict with each other, you can only have one of those two.
---
Ahh thought  I was just getting lucky that's good :)
---
every sunday again. I bought everything I wanted by now but my goal is to buy everything that isn't completely useless. Looking at you water well.
---
But yeah, I'll buy everything as long as nothing new pops up.
---
Of for sure! A ritual sacrifice!
---
Mine disappeared for a day then came back today.... So yeah not just you but it fixed itself over here.
---
I have  a question about them, have you noticed that sometimes the treasure hunter outfit has ripped black sleeves and some are sleeveless? I put one on my main and it has the black sleeves(which I think looks better) but then I transferred one to my low level toon and it was a vest with no sleeves
---
Depends entirely on mods, if it a crappy fixer it's effectively scrip so maybe few hundred caps from vendor.
---
We have a few women in our clan that do play. They are out there. We are on PC so let me know if you would like our Discord info.
---
Female here with lvl 202. I'm usually playing with random people from Discord but don't have mic so everyone thinks that I am man :D
---
I would rather have an ammo collectron, one that allows finding a specific ammo type, but also randomly finds all other ammo.  
---
AmmoTron? BulletTron? Hmmm.
---
Maybe just maybe you took a spot most dwellers picked? Like the one with the acid and lead resource?
---
no, it's a bug on some servers sometimes
---
About tree fiddy
---
I didn‚Äôt play Gwent at all on my first play through of the Witcher, when I tried it out on my second run I was so hooked I would travel around to all the towns just to try to find those rare cards. I even ended up winning the big gwent tournament . Such an awesome addition to an already amazing game, idk if bethesda could make a card game as fun as gwent
---
They don't kill me but when I die they'll steal all my loot
---
That's because of the underarmor. The Enclave Operative underarmor clips through some outfits.
---
Scaly skin + grounded mutation and armor plated back pack with the stealth suit brings you to 280 Dr and 290Er.
---
That's just about where deminishing returns start to kick in for DR/ER. Than add class freak/starched genes to negate the downsides of mutations. If you are on a team and equip strange in numbers itll add another 12.5 Dr and  32.5ER bringing youre total to 292 abd 332.
---
Thats 6 perks to add 152 DR/and 192 ER . Chances are you are already running classfreak/starched genes anyways.
---
You could run barbarian,iron clad and evasive to gain 175 DR/ER. But that takes 11 perks and  requires 15 str and 15 agility to get maximum benefits from the perks .
---
 Both routes get you just about to the deminsishing return zone of 300Dr/ER. But id much rather do the back pack and mutations route.
---
I've always thought a buried Alien City or better yet a buried Dunwich Old Gods City under the Appalachian Mountains would be cool
---
Edit: Honestly this would be a fun one. They have experience with a underworld zone with Black Reach it could be similar.
---
The feels
---
I've seen people complain that they don't need a damn /s tag to know when something isn't serious.  This clearly was not one of those situations lol.
---
I guess it‚Äôs not designed for late players though since it‚Äôs cartable at level 25, a good alternative to the tadpole backpack
---
Makes sense, use a mini gun mostly
---
Oh that makes sense because I have the operative under armor on my main and the bos suit on my low level toon. The operative under armor looks dope even if it is just clipping through lol. Thanks for clearing that up for me
---
Secret service helmet
---
No problem.
---
6 slots max
---
holy s***, you are actually meaning to collect card around the map, have a deck and duel other players like a yu-gi-oh! style or some kind of a poker? because I really like this idea! as in rdr2 there is the option to poker with other players why not in fallout
---
Anything cheaper? Or I can trade for at least? Also atom shop is doable I got 2000 atoms saved up
---
It refills as usual when you‚Äôre not thrusting. I had my first proper long distance flight today. Went really well. Build a high platform with a spring trap launcher. Flew well, thrusting along here and there. Until it didn‚Äôt, and I fell like a rock. Tried to time the flare out but hit pretty hard. I have one piece of reduced fall damage, bird bones, strange in numbers perk and goat legs. Did almost no damage.
---
Personally i find this bug very inefficent and not worth the time. (Super boring aswell)
---
Gray knit cap. There's the insurgent hat too but it just looks like a saggy black beanie.
---
I quite like it also, it is time gated though, if you don't finish in time you lose...
---
This would be so helpful, finally able to run in a nuked area
---
It looks the best
---
Insurgent outfit hat :-)
---
Alright,after I got everything else with bullion I need I‚Äôll get that
---
Oh i did that a few days ago. I just wish they'd change or remove it.
---
Absolutely!! It's a welcome cap sink
---
Yeah,when someone tried selling me. An insurgent hat I denied it because I thought it was just a hat renamed
---
Sentry arms, torso, dual shoulder launcher, dual gattling lasers, and assaultron legs.
---
Nah, just take a break my friend, you've hit the wall.
---
I did so about 6 months back, took few months off, all good again now :-)
---
Is that what she says now?!?
---
The fact is that i feel there is no new content, S.C.O.R.E. cannot be called dlc for example, also adding a short questline is not making an endgame content, this is what i miss, the endgame
---
You only learn mods from breaking down gauss rifles.
---
If youre looking for them, make sure you build a new rifle every time (long as you have the plan)
---
Thank you for pointing that out, i personally do not have fallout 1st so i had no idea this could be done with a tent :) This explains a lot why there are so many tents at that place lol
---
No, it's actually the name. It just doesn't look that good in my opinion. If someone renames an item, only they can see the new name. If they try to sell it to you or put it in a vendor, you'll always see the original name.
---
If you change servers (which includes having to search for a new one die to your camp placement) it bugs out and doesn't show them on the map.
---
I feel you, just stop playing until BOS return, don't let FOMO effect you before that :-)
---
Ah right,thanks for the help
---
You would get double from Carnivore, so 10% extra XP, add the Inspirational perk that is +15 so and sleep for 10 sec you get kindered effect another 5%, just those 3 equal to 30% XP bonus.
---
There is no rush you will catch up to him soon enough. I just wanted to Smack him that's why i'm ahead of him.
---
Your AP can fill up in mid air again. But that only works when flying slow. A sprint jump into a jetpack push is much faster but also draws more AP and they wont fill up in the air if you wont let go of the sprint button. As others mentioned, its risky in this engine if you picked a laggy server. Best bet still are two armor pieces with 50% fall dmg reduction. Otherwise you need alot of AP refresh on your armor and some practise. I tested it alot at the monorail elevator. And at full fall speed it needs a push of at least half my AP to survive.
---
Im pretty sure the sentry bots are in the Guide part 1
---
One of us! One of us!
---
It probably is easier to farm then sb brain. Personally i average in my inventory around 15 brains at anytime since when you do this route you kill 2 sb which result in a chance of getting sb brain, with BB you get double and you only use one every 30 min.
---
The crafted mask has foliage because i saw a dude today rocking that mask with a pirate hat and he looked like something from Pirates of the Carribean
---
My character is 565 already ü§£ 865 with excavator calibrated shocks and this bonus
---
It makes good look normal, and bad look really childish. There're things to learn of communities like this
---
I usually burn my books after reading them,it makes completely sense to me.
---
I played new Vegas when I was way too young to be playing it so I didn't play caravan but it gets a ton of praise. I actually went back and played it when I got older and man oh man caravan is actually really cool and a ton of fun as a side game. Gwent is meh in my opinion I could never get into it just because I suck at making decks but a game like that would be so cool in this. Imagine people making areas at their base to play it or I imagine people in the community would host tournaments. This is a good idea but I don't think they would implement it. But we can always hope.
---
I‚Äôve felt the same. Getting the daily SCORE doesn‚Äôt take long and I got tired of doing other dailies. So since the legendary run put NW in the mix, I‚Äôve been playing that. It‚Äôs challenging, something new each time, and helps leveling up in adventure.
---
I checked and the dog food still had base stats meaning it doesnt get boosted by Carnivore. If you want my tip, take over the ""Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm"" this workshop produces food and the one you should get is salisbury steak. All you need to do is power it up :D
---
It is starting to feel like a job now, I like collecting outfits etc. But one I'm not after are dropped from events randomly but the RNG is a killer. I'm in able to work unfortunately, so it's my escape playing fallout 76, I think after you have completed an event so many times you get the outfit. I'm   literally doing up to 100 events a day and I'm not getting the drops at all and I'm level 240 so Ive done a few event lol. While system needs a rework
---
I‚Äôd say that some games are meant to be grindy, and they should exist for the surprisingly fairly large amount of people who are into it, but it shouldn‚Äôt be this game.
---
Drop a landmine in a corner and shot It. Maybe you are lucky and destroy a wall
---
I know right, maybe is past fallouts it made a little sense since it just increased one skill.
---
I was in the ash heap today in the Herrington mansion and the lighting was freaking out with some weird white spot/dark spot areas. I'm not sure what was up but I had to get off anyways because of server maintenance at 5am. Server stability maybe?
---
Are there beter backpacks than just the standard?, i ask this for a freind of courseüòÖ
---
Yeah mutants need a buff.

this will be white. u can change Rgb to whatever color you want :) NOW LIKE ME
---
Yes it is. Pick up some of his eggs near the statue in point pleasant, make some mothman egg omelettes. Go about your day. He may find you at some point.
---
New content takes time. It's less than 3 months since Wastelanders released and BOS will coming with new quests soon. In between these they've added seasons so any ideas that things are stagnant is just wrong as it's pretty much a new game from just 6M ago.
---
I run the tunnel now and collect ore but you need a min two people and that just to scrape through getting all the ore 4 is better as you all can collect ore from same place u believe if I take the ore from one tunnnel it doesn't remove on the other players screen
---
Considering you can get the top 3,4 fixer for 2 apples and fart right now, i'd say anything lesser is basically worthless.
---
Are you on the acid/lead spot?
---
Ohhhh I haven‚Äôt seen that one, but I feel like I need it now. I did find the traveling merchant robot today and got the witch costume. So I rocked that for a bit today. I also like to collect outfits! I wish we had display cases for clothes haha
---
At least you can show your OG status.
---
They disappear when you claim one and hace ti defend It. The reappear afterwords
---
They managed snap in 76 when 4 had none.  Might be harder working on every other object bar walls etc.  
---
Sometimes easier to start over.  But I'm sure the devs have a lot on their plate atm.
---
I got this game during the summer sale on steam and already have 40 hours in it. I kinda just do some of the challenges and then things like "repair ten items" is something I already do. I mean if someone needs someone to do some of the challenges with me and my buddy play all the time and I recently bought fallout 1st which I'm having trouble deciding if it's worth it or not. Overall the battle pass rewards though are super dope because it's literally just a bunch of free skins and currency alongside some things for me to use in camp.
---
How do u hold hands with someone else? I gotta start doing this ü§£
---
The head ain't worth it, but the rest of it is.
---
What is better against the queen a Bloodied or Anti Armour
---
You're right. We already proposed an overhaul in the past the best two option were:
---
- collectore perk ,while equipped,makes them last forever(1 at a time).
---
-collector perk makes them reusable.
---
Right now only a duper can take advantage of magazines and bobbleheads.
---
Been making deep pocket armour for them and giving weapons and stimpack some are really grateful other not so much
---
Get the chest piece and jet pack first
---
I knew someone who ran a comic shop...sorry 'fantasy and scifi workshop' and basically second hand COMICS were basically worthless unless in mint condition or very rare. Considering the availability and state of the ones you find they may as well be disposable.
---
They are more things to take priority.  They have at least added a find new world.  Before it was just tough luck.  There are already a lot of QOL improvements we take for granted.
---
I love the ghille stuff but I had a weird freaking glitch earlier today where when I walked in 3rd person the leaves on the back would float behind me and then when I stopped moving they would reattach. Good armor but that was a weird bug.
---
I wonder is getting an answer from Bethesda support also relies on RNG üòÉ
---
'Available in the Atom store, ***Support 1st*** for only 1500 Atoms'
---
Ammo that usually costs 1c is a good way to make currency exchange. When you need the money back you sell them
---
i disagree. surely it's better to get the actual armour rather than mods.
---
And yeah. leave the head until you have nothing else to spend bullion on
---
Welp that's the highest I've ever seen. And here i am with my measly 280 carry weightüòÇ
---
I have tried to love the gauss rifle a multitude of times, but it just seems too gimmicky. Without charging it, it's just a meh weapon.
---
I would suggest you give it a try and see if it works for you. You don't need all the super perks as you can simply compare it to your quad lever rifle. 
---
Instigating weapons are first shot weapons as after that you don't get any other bonuses from the Instigating effect. Myself I would keep using the lever rifle and if you can survive with it, why change it. But remember you can carry multiple weapons and if they all use same perks, then good for that.
---
It's gonna cost you tons of scrip. Particularly if you go for unyielding
---
I prefer the legendary run. Previously we had challenges for atoms I have zero interest in. I still regularly completed challenges though as I enjoy that aspect. Now with a progression bar it feels like the challenges mean something. Yeah, I'll never complete it, probably won't even make halfway, but as I said I don't care for the rewards but still enjoy the challenges and that aspect of progression.
---
Maybe I'm a bit weird....
---
The Gauss will be good in certain situations, like for 1 shotting scorchbeasts from stealth, but its broken af in VATS right now (mine shows hits and damage numbers, yet basically only tickles enemies, 1600 damage uncharged headshot on a scorched conqueror takes off basically no health) It works fine with manual aim, but its a fairly slow reload with only 5 rounds, I'd stick with the lever action as the main use weapon and only pull out the gauss in certain situations.
---
I'd love to collect ores but Beth decided it's not worth any XP, not worth any loot and so not worth my time.
---
It it gave guaranteed bonus rewards maybe but completion XP plus a steamer trunk worth of trash and .38 ammo, pass.
---
Okay but would you say it‚Äôs worth putting scrips and gold into?
---
It's a bug.  Which isn't great as you can't see if a workshop has been taken or not.
---
I've been playing this past week since I picked it up on steam too. I'm sitting at about level 30 currently and I would recommend just doing the main quest for a bit because it nets you a ton of plans and crafting stations for your camp. Teach yourself about the mechanics like having to scrap weapons to unlock the attachments for them as well as how the new SCORE system works. If you need anyone to play with I'm literally addicted to this game.
---
I find instigating more effective in commando type weapons
---
I don't actually care about the loot in that one I just want to have a event with a full band once.
---
Yeah whatever is best for you, to me the biggest attraction of the armor set is the increased mobility, if you need the dr I‚Äôd agree with you
---
Aside from the dozen bugs that haven't been addressed and are as old as it older than wastelanders? The lack of bethesda doing anything about dupers or hackers? The seemingly complete lack of paid playtesters resulting in things like the score reward before completing the challenge or the ammo converter or the screaming eagle skin. They talk this Stuff up, say it's incredible new content when really it's just another layer or grind with no content added. I guarantee you within the next month three new inventory glitches will pop up, be it inventory dissappears or can be stolen again or just a whole nother variation of duping, a dozen absolutely worthless atomic shop items that are either incomplete or outrageously priced, and nothing else. Their neglect to take care of servers, allowing for four hard crashes within six hours, the lag even on private servers with just two people. There's still an entire fifth of the community livid about PvP and I don't know what happened to them and their little "War on Bethesda' beyond getting nerfed into the ground. The fact that bugs from four still persistent. And the complete lack of endgame. It's that lack of change despite their words that dissapointed me. I get that have bigger things like Deathloop to manage right now, but these have been issues most of the games lifespan.
---
I‚Äôm a girl and play on ps4 quite a bit
---
To make scorchbeast queen spawn there.
---
I‚Äôm level 351 so levelling fast is not easy. Made an alt character today to complete the weekly ‚Äòlevel up x3‚Äô and the daily level up, this really helped but didn‚Äôt get the level up score at level 2 from the vault, it happened at level 3... 
---
This was my first new character since launch and was weird to see the map empty of locations! üëçüèº
---
You realise a .50 is a .50 ...... the physics dont change only the efficiency of the mechanism.
---
Nukes?  Not seen them for a while.  
---
They used to be like every hour or so,  now I'm lucky to see one all night. 
---
But yeah,  SBQ
---
They turn to dust from old age after one read
---
to spawn the super bitch queen and conquer her terrors
---
It sounds neat, but dangerous. I wouldn't want to stuck out of nowhere because I suddenly lose 25/50/75 carry weight.
---
Like nothing since most are duped to high hell
---
I play as a female because its funny to mess with the creepy guys.
---
&gt;Right now only a duper can take advantage of magazines and bobbleheads.
---
Nah, they have set spawn points. Throw on Pannapictagraphist and curator and you can have a nice stockpile of buffs that last an hour. 
---
Some of these magazines are way to powerful for them to be allowed to last permanently, even if it was only one at a time.  Something like a permanent -25% from robots, when stacked wits Troubleshooters Armor and Lone Wanderer, would make you basically invincible to robots - making farming them for legendaries or even the silo run even more trivial than they are.  +20% chance to avoid damage forms Scorched is also very good, especially during queen fights when the spawns come.  
---
They‚Äôd have to rebalance them in order to make them permanent, it‚Äôd make me sad if some of the good ones all got brought down to the level of ‚ÄúSwim twice as fast‚Äù
---
Also now it's a potential spawn point for the wendigo colossus.
---
I miss people nuking whitesprings , it was good for picking flowers.
---
Has any fallout had an end game?
---
There's an end game boss fight. Don't worry, there will be more nukes going to the upper centre of the map next month.
---
I prefer the Lever Action, especially if you have a Quad. 
---
The Gauss Rifle deals a lot of damage, but in VATS it‚Äôs not the most reliable weapon. It suffers from a strange accuracy issue. To my understanding, whatever the initial accuracy is, that‚Äôs the accuracy you‚Äôll get when you fire. In other words, if you start out at 1%, move close enough to get it up to 95%, your actual hit chance will still be 1%. It also suffers from poor accuracy when you charge it up prior to VATS.
---
That being said, try it out and see what you think. If you‚Äôre spec‚Äôd out for Rifleman, you can probably one-shot most enemies in sneak without have to charge it.

---
Encryptid is truly the only event where bloodied builds just dont cut it but being honest that if you arent running that event with a group then it is what it is
---
I nuked WS yesterday...and before I'd done a circle of the zone someone launched another at the same place..why? There's no SBQ that spawns afresh so it's basically wasted.
---
üòÇ Why does everyone have to always look at the negatives with this game.
---
They are so rare, especially the ones you want so its impossible to get a good stock of them.
---
I just thought it would be cool to have some of the more unique buffs like the turret ones, make a rocket defence vs scorched beasts
---
Yes it‚Äôs Tuesday, around 5pm for me on GMT
---
The only way to know what‚Äôs coming is to look at the datamines but there‚Äôs no date for them
---
or your mom throws them out when she's cleaning the garage while you're at college
---
Master Infiltrator isn't really designed for the Auto Bypass and more of a "here's your unlocking skills at Rank 0"
---
I'm fine with that I don't mind the mini game.
---
No. In fact I think it‚Äôs more alive than ever. Way more players at events. Players interacting is up.
---
It's not for me. I bought it and so far it's my worst bullion buy. I stuck the BioCommMesh mod on.
---
I'm not sure if there's a part that I'm missing that is making my gameplay more challenging or if it's just the level I tried it, but I'm glad you found it easy.
---
I like 50% extra drug duration more
---
Shame though haha New Legendary Card 
---
Omnivore- Allows both Carnivore and Herbivore Mutations. 
---
If only....
---
The fasnach berret looks pretty good with it
---
You already reach the cap of damage reduction with gear and perks and you cannot reach complete immunity to anything.
---
And yes only dupers,let's say you want backwoodsman number 4. It could take you a minute or 3 weeks to find it.
---
lol no not my collection
---
Every rep point you‚Äôve gotten so far, you have to get again.
---
You must be on the wrong servers. I‚Äôm lucky if I‚Äôm able to find a silo that‚Äôs rebuilt the warhead nowadays.
---
No, I‚Äôm on half of the final stage of rep not halfway through as in the middle stage
---
It worked! Thank you so much üòÑ
---
Load out and supposed to be coming again the future. We need mod support for consoles like fallout 4
---
If no ore is collected then you don't have a chance for the rare rewards. But you do you, baby.
---
That's a yes from me!
---
I want my Responders shit out and proud on display and my PA skin for my fuckaround T51b set is too beautiful to sit in a STASH.
---
I got medics from the follow up angry turtle video
---
üòÇ Im level 150 and I've not unlocked leave vault 76
---
If you‚Äôre doing shotguns you want strength and the enforcer perk in agility, I wouldn‚Äôt waste your points too much in charisma
---
Female lvl 300 here. The mansplaining is real, y'all. The ingame community is usually nice tho, no complaints.
---
Ok thats interesting. I might look into it.
---
I pray you never play TF2 with that attitude. That game hasn‚Äôt seen a content update besides cosmetics in literal years, and that game is still alive and strong.
---
Ive had to start a public team a few times this week. After I start one others seem to figure it out and start their own.
---
The neighborly stage requires a huge amount of rep points compared to the previous stages.
---
Man you have to get used to it, when I first got it I killed myself falling CONSTANTLY ü§£
---
I haven't experienced it once playing as a female character
---
You mean buy a day and a half‚Äôs worth of gold in less than ten seconds *and* not worry about the next person going to my vendor getting something that‚Äôll put me over max? You can bet your ass I do that.
---
That's like the first thing mentioned in this guide to attack are the sentry bots there. It's under Part 1.
---
Cosmetics are useless for me, maybe if they had a good fixed  legendary in the pool.
---
that‚Äôs so sweet!
---
God damn, Loch Ness Monster!
---
Get outta here, ain't nobody giving you tree fiddy!
---
It's not necessarily new blood, but new toons players make to grind level up challenges more easily.
---
Purchase fallout 1st and you will have it.
---
Damn,I‚Äôm probably just going to give up at this point,it‚Äôs just become a job at this stage
---
Do you have a source for the cap?  FO76 is based on the FO4 mechanics, and Damage resistance is different than damage reduction, and in FO4 it was possible to achieve 100% damage reduction (in fact, if you had it, the enemies would scream to run away). It wasn‚Äôt achieveable due to the limit on slots that you could get the legendary effects in, but with mods you could test it out
---
Without considering anything else right now, a full set of a ‚Äúslayer gear‚Äù is going to get you 75% reduction from that damage type, and then an extra 15% from lone wanderer.  Now they may not be additive to 90% since they are not all legendary effects, but they do stack in that one applies, then the next, then the next. Regardless of your DR/ER.
---
Me too, need around 9000 more xp
---
idk man, if you're really dedicated, you might have already played 1600 nonstop days of fallout 76 by now
---
Yes and when only two or three autocomplrte that is one of the ones that does so!
---
Finally, someone with the butts to help
---
I think it would not affect the game any way.
---
Specific spots would be good
---
Not saying this is why, but I generally leave an empty frame blocking stuff to show my dissatisfaction with the camp owner.
---
Pointlessly locked doors, failed traps, or vendors filled with nothing but garbage... I might be petty enough to block your front door with a power armor frame, and you will HAVE to spend a few seconds claiming it to move it... Take that.
---
We don't get a chance to talk to them, I've still not gotten an actual person, every ticket gets AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED!
---
And they ACTUALLY USED TO PAY OUT MISSING ATOMS FOR BROKEN CHALLENGES IN THE PAST!
---
I accept any and all donations. Haven't been able to get one from Rad Rumble, haven't been able to get enough to trade for one.
---
yeah that does not seem legit, but i didn't believe the negative vats cost until i tried it.
---
I just get my food for my vendors from sunshine meadows industrial farm. It generates food that doesn‚Äôt spoil and doesn‚Äôt give rads. :)
---
I did. Where is it? How do I use it?
---
I have the gauss shotgun, and if you are a player who likes shotguns in this game, I think this one is worth grinding for.... I‚Äôm having so much fun with mine...( mmmmm bloody mess )
---
Well I never found it in front of a door, and all I sell are plans and the only locked things I have are water purifier's, my junk Maker's and the ammo thingy
---
Another idea is have a legendary perk that lets you have a random bobble head every so often like the legendary perks they already have for food and chems.
---
you open your quick menu where you can select your favourited items and then press a button, on PS4 its triangle i think
---
it should say what you need to press in the bottom of the screen
---
There is 0 evidence of score refunds, the official line from Bethesda is they can't, I've contacted support numerous times about this myself and all I get is an automated response that nothing can or will be done and my ticket is locked before I get to a person!
---
holy shit new raider items? Finally some raider walls
---
Plop on power armor and you‚Äôre invincible lmao.
---
just to double check, are the PA chassis empty? Have you tried placing them to see if there is a full set of power armor inside? Maybe people are giving you a full set of power armor as a gift.
---
This wall of text hit unreasonably hard. Maybe because I was expecting a summary and a pic or something.
---
Create a Bethesda account and link it to steam on the Bethesda website.
---
rare rewards can be exchanged for goods and services
---
but muh fomo, I cant just play another game noooo
---
From the quick menu . Triangle button on ps4
---
THANKS!
---
They're always empty, no fusion core nothing
---
np :D
---
I started playing yesterday on Xbox and someone gave me some fairy light things and a ratty skirt and I was so happy. I put them in my little camp shed and it made it feel more like a home ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Yes please
---
favourite wheel and y on the xbone
---
It would remove the need to ever run a Silo after the end game quest.
---
How do I edit/decorate it please? :)
---
Someone jumped into a bush, not noticing that I was also in that bush. Two more people entered the bush. I panic and run away, getting gunned down in the process. #bushlife
---
I just use the wallbreaching glitch to get right to the launch room
---
I don't think that you can decorate it. The only thing that you can do is apply a skin wich you have to do in the atomic shop.
---
in the atomic shop there are certain skins for the tents that you can select, everytime you put down a tent it will have the skin you selected
---
you cant decorate it though, using those skins is your only option of custumization üëçüèº
---
Team Hoarder! 
---
Funny because last night I decided to take off all my perk cards to see what my actual total weight I'm lugging around and I'm up to 2792.  I need an intervention!
---
I was curious what each perk bonus was for what I'm holding.
---
Total	2792	
---
Bandolier	2551
---
Bear Arms	2451
---
Ord Express	2299
---
Sturdy Frame	2772

Batt Included	2642

Why play instruments, turn the jukebox on and kill stuff, inside/outside it doesn't matter just tag stuff get xp....
---
Trust me...its not the gold thats the issue with it
---
my first question would be: WHY did someone go to a scorched earth event, which has a high chance of getting downed, and has his bags full of junk? if your stash is full: drop the stuff, you are overachieving and just hurting your self. there is not really a need to carry and keep all that stuff in my humble opinion.
---
Sorry then, I have no idea
---
No thanks my comic book shop would go bust.....
---
The wrapped cap looks good on it. But then you cant have a gas mask.
---
Awesome! Thanks so much.
---
Ty!
---
I think you are right. I remember Todd Howard mentioning it in the last Q&amp;A. Something about 'laughing at Alpha-Aaron's suffering'...
---
Man, you must have really pissed off Todd
---
On a serious note, this bug is really annoying and I hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Been seeing a lot of positive reactions to the new Xbox gamepass players. Complete opposite of how the rdo community reacted. Post end of the world wasteland have some really nice people in it lol
---
I would say close to a month, maybe more if you‚Äôre only doing the one daily.
---
whats on the west side of the river? its a huge space...
---
What else can I do?also I‚Äôm halfway through neighbourly,so would you say a few weeks?
---
You turn into a wendigo.
---
Don't do it!
---
He couldn't unlock it, you were helping him out!
---
I was just trying to add functionality to the sink, I wasnt saying it would be easy... lol at the downvotes... cant have an opinion ü§£
---
If that were the case I would expect teams to be in vogue as players sought out maximum xp.
---
Is that what you did? And why is my steam name in the game my friend code, but my girlfriends her actual steam name?
---
if you get out of your armor and exit the game sometimes the empty frame sticks around for a little while.
---
Orbital Strike Beacon glitches and auto-fires, and runaway meltdown at a nuke plant would be similar.
---
Could just be the glitch that leaves ghost chassis's after someone in PA fast travels. Sometimes leaves a non useable ghost chassis behind.
---
have fun man üòÅüëçüèº
---
So what armour is better?
---
I can't find it in the atom shop. Sorry to be a pain, but am I doing something working?
---
How about the wood-fired flamer?
---
I can get 
---
52l-580 once they add pockets deep pockets to SSA
---
Respectfully disagree. With practice you never need to take fall damage, the "trick" is falling long enough to get enough downward momentum that jetpacking won't lift you up, and then holding the jetpack on for at least a full second to decelerate before you pound the ground.
---
The people I see die from fall damage use the "bunny hop" tapping of the jetpack, which keeps them high up until they don't have enough AP to decelerate their death dive.
---
The mutations marsupial and bird bones make a huge difference, especially combined with strange in numbers, but you don't need them with practice. It's worth practicing - if you've modded your legs to reduce fall damage then replace it with ultralight for my AP Regen and longer flights, and the acrobat's legendaries can be replaced with loads of better effects. If the game gets laggy swap in goat legs, so "Flying is still the safest way to travel.'
---
believe they're implementing this with the wendigo colossus event.
---
Will this be updated now that it seems we get 9 dailies a day?
---
I tried to engage in fisticuffs with somebody a few days ago after seeing he was unarmed. I put my gun away and started punching him only to have his teammate come to his rescue and tear me a new asshole with a 50cal. 
---
There's little room for honour or mercy in the storm it seems. It's kill or be killed.
---
You can do random encounters in a few different places, marigold pavilion is a good place to find an encounter. Davenport also has a photo daily where you can take a picture of crater or foundation. Just choose foundation and sell the photos to meg at crater.
---
670 after a rad ant lager and peperoni roll
---
I think people just aren't used to it and forget, like going through an entire play session with your card setup for the wrong weapon, it will get better.
---
Could be your camp happens to be near a spawn?
---
Thanks!
---
And I've just now noticed the lovely autocorrect my phone gave me for Mothman lol
---
Lol, amazing autocorrect
---
good idea, It would be nice to have, for those of us who don't run bloodied builds. though being able to get more scrap when scrapping might be better. So + 25 weight for one, more scrap from Armour for two, more scrap from weapons for three and more scrap from Junk for all four.
---
Why does it spawn with no armor then?
---
Hey now, I am pretty sure it is violation of the r/fo76 rules to be positive and make positive threads. It is one of the rules (I think rule #859). I just wanted to give you a heads up before you get perma-banned. 
---
Joking aside, I agree with you. I just started recently even though I am a long term fallout fan. I heard so many bad things about the game that I did not bother until a month ago. I am having a blast so far and I am looking forward to Meat week next month.
---
some way to lock the lights would be nice, I'm not saying it's a priority but it would be nice
---
Yeah a few weeks sounds about right. I did settler rep from cautious to max In about a month. I sides with crater so I don‚Äôt remember how long it took to max them out.
---
You haven't seen the 50 times a week where someone makes one of these posts and then the person sees it and replies? Happens pretty often
---
Cool set up. But the place is over engineered, the steel beams are unnecessary.
---
Because radiation made mushrooms sentient.
---
Didn't mario thought you anything?
---
I think it would be fine adding random drop location since everyone is nuking the same spot every day....
---
i always let the other players get their hits in i have been on the other side when some jackass one hits everything and it just pissed me off
---
Everyone has spoiled it but  you find out by making it through the main questline e.
---
I wave, drop chems and then do the robot dance until they pick them up.
---
That's very kind of you, and a may hit you up soon. Working nights at the moment. Thanks
---
Mmm-hmm. Unfortunately, without some examples of said creativity, all you‚Äôve got there is ad hominem.
---
There might not be any available at the moment. They release skins every so often and if you have a 1st membership for the month that skin is available you can claim it.  If you weren't able to claim it the month it was up, then you won't have access to it.

I would love this. Googly eyes glasses and commie whacker only.

No problem man, happy to help you out!

It is my single favourite thing I used to hate that
---
Bottom text? In my day we called them "tramp stamps".
---
YOUR SOUP IS DRY!!!
---
Don't forget to ask professor for homework!
---
I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but this keeps happening again and again, it's just not funny anymore. The game has tons of issues still, the gauss pistol bug I mentioned for example has caused my death a bunch of times already.
---
(basically you can't use items, sprint or reload most of the time when you use it, it's super nasty and has been around since wastelanders launched)
---
Yes it is, I‚Äôm guessing your gf already linked her steam and Bethesda account, maybe forgot. 
---
I linked mine years ago to play fallout shelter through steam and forgot until I started FO76 this year. 
---
When you link the accounts it ‚Äúshould‚Äù use the Bethesda account name.
---
that depends on whether or not you need gold
---
I mean you're getting into basic play style questions, but I usually buy it because what the hell else are you going to do with 6000 caps
---
Just to add, the room is full of stuffed enemies etc and there's. Scavenger Collectron outside the window.
---
In terms of location, it's right on top of the 64 sign on route 64 in-between the airport and The Wayward
---
I don‚Äôt know. Just brainstorming here.
---
Ahh ok, so after I link it, it shoukd swap?
---
I feel like most of the people who like Battle Royale just play Fortnite or PUBG
---
*Scanning for sarcasm. Result: inconclusive.*
---
They update every Tuesday in the morning for me (West Coast USA), and on Bethesda they have a little article a few hours later showing the atomshop items for the week.
---
I got so lucky yesterday at rad rumble. Someone covered both sides with me and EVERYONE ELSE got ore. At first I was annoyed because everyone was killing my crippled ghouls, but then the ore went from 0 to 100 and we won. That took some of the salt off, for sure.
---
Yes and they could throw in the existing botanical poster. I've been waiting for that to come back for ages!
---
I prefer the well fed bonus of rejuvinated. When I switch to bloodied I never heal,just eat what I kill to keep the hunger bar above 75%. Saves me 2 points.
---
It's a little riskier tho,but worth.
---
Damage mitigating perks are the core of the bloodied build!
---
It takes forever but don't loose hope. Do Wards Daily Quest and the photomode daily quest from the overseers home. It takes awhile but you get treasury notes and script.
---
Agree, colour pattern fits nicely and the wrapped cap is kinda common. 
---
Not what you wan't to hear, but to get this out ot the way: the responders fireman helmet (white) + insurgent of is the absolute best looking combination imo. It has a similar colour scheme and just looks awesome. I got the helmet from "path of enlightment" 2 weeks ago, but it still is one of the rarest helmets in game at this point.
---
Wars?
---
Stand at Vault 76 &amp; give out the bubblegum to newbs.... &amp; hope they don't report you to Bethesda for grooming them
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFsV6MrA0fc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFsV6MrA0fc) this is a cool one too
---
It‚Äôs all lipstick on the pig. The game mechanics have not changed, same events same tasks, just a different makeup reward. Your fear is you‚Äôll come back and not have the  en vogue lipstick shade that others are sporting.
---
For me the game is summed up by the ‚Äúexplore Appalachia‚Äù task. 7600 hours, that‚Äôs 2.61 years playing 8 hours a day &amp; your reward is 20 Atoms. Would you work a job 8 hours a day for a year (including weekends) for less than 10 atoms a year. There is not 7600 hours worth of things to explore, it‚Äôs the smallest map in Fallout history!
---
Isn't that a pioneer scouts unlockable?
---
If you do end up trading and are worried, just use an official courier!
---
Junkies is just a lot easier and safer to run.
---
I think it would be to much for them to add. The server struggles and when you have 18 players max stash's, camps with everything in them, I just think it would really push the server or cost half a camp budget. But who knows, I could be way off on this theory.
---
Ah yes, it‚Äôs the firebreather mask but with white textures, right? I used to have that on an old character but sold it for cheap.
---
Well that would explain why I haven't seen it! I haven't started the Pioneer Scouts quest line yet!
---
Wait you can leave them and they wont come back into your inventory? Hows that shit working i always scrapped them its a pain in the ass when you accidently press go in instead of transfer to just get the fusion core out of World spawned Power armors
---
I thought of trying this the other day when I was the last alive against a team of 4. 
---
I went in the open and got into photomode fists to give the message.
---
1 missile and 3000watt of tesla later I hadn't had my fair fist fight.
---
SS armor is the best, I agree to start with the chest and go from there.
---
Wrong sub.
---
Don't forget a wood armour skin! Everyone loves those! :-)
---
Upgrading is downgrading in this game, if you upgrade you loose condition and add carry weight and get a barely noticeable difference, so I standard everything. I think upgrading should increase condition and reduce carry weight!
---
first and foremost, Google is your friend. not trying to be rude but you'll run across answers to questions you didn't even think to ask that way.
---
rewards are leveled so it's good to wait for certain unique weapons, like the Sledge from the mayor, or a 10 mm sub with a pyro effect you can get from a nanny bot
---
I love Nexus but I already have so many stability issues without mods that I decided not to try it, but don't let that stop you
---
That's fine with me - save me a few mouse clicks. It is better than the current system.
---
I'll use the time to make myself a sandwich or something.
---
When they give with one hand, they take with the other.
---
To counter the good protection they took away carry weight :-)
---
thank you for this fix friend, worked for me
---
Try the market sub. Trading posts aren't for this reddit
---
Just drop it from your pip boy rather than using it. 
---
Square on PS4.
---
Except mods should be weightless, like in every other game!
---
Makes me wish the 1st scrap box was universal between characters due it all the excess unused scrap my unarmed build ends up with!
---
Ohio River Adventures has a daily mirelurk meat turnin for a bit extra. Get some queen meat for them.
---
Wtf will try this instantly. Level 92 and still learning the basics only fallout can do such things haha üòÇ
---
I'm a girl and I've played since release. There are tons of girls
---
Its true the game would be better if there werent dickheads who live for griefing and breaking the game to cheat.
---
Made the edit above, sorry for the typo :)
---
Ah ok
---
the jet pack sucks for soft landings, no matter how gently you touch down you still take full fall damage.
---
If people stayed on mic they can always ask me to change my card!
---
It‚Äôs a known glitch that people use to build ‚Äòunderground‚Äô camps in the game.
---
Probably duped it so hes willing to trade it for a little less than normal value
---
The insurgent hat doesn‚Äôt go well with anything. Makes you look like a comedy gnome.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs how it works, as far as I know.
---
I don't know why they're so stingy with the paint jobs, or why they keep dropping paint for the hunting rifle and the sledgehammer. I've got multiple paint options for fire axes and a pickaxe. who uses a pickaxe?
---
Try this: not able to use stimpacks at ALL when using gauss weapons ;) Yup, it's true and has been around since the launch of wastelanders and happens most of the time. (includes inability to sprint and reload for certain death)
---
Sounds like a person's glitch camp. This method of building uses an interactable item to glitch under the world to a buildable space. First time I've seen a terminal though, usually it's a musical instrument.
---
There is always a beta chad showing off his meta slave build.
---
sup homie, i dont have an extra plan for the heated coil mod, however, if u want i could put the heated coil mod on ur baseball bat for you....... on PC
---
It is better than launch, but worthy of nearly 2 years progress? I don‚Äôt know.
---
I take exception to you saying the map is huge. In my view it‚Äôs the smallest map of fallout so far, fewer secrets, less engaging. For example, remember all those huge vaults you used to find and explore, in 76 vaults are small dungeons periodically available.
---
I still play the game, it‚Äôs like muscle memory, the other players are what make it fun or not.
---
If fallout shelter did not exist I would postulate that 76 is Bethesda stab at a phone app game, it is that light on content.
---
They are clearly trying to attract the Fortnite, COD players to the franchise but in my opinion they have lost the essence of fallout along the way. It‚Äôs the issue of trying to be all things to all people.
---
This calendar show Smiley resetting at 8pm every Sunday.   He resets on Saturdays at 8pm.  I usually check him on Saturday mornings "just in case", but nothing, then when I go back after 8pm on Saturday evening he is restocked.  I even did it last night.  (I am in the Eastern zone, so it is still 8pm for me, with no adjustments necessary).
---
You may want to check some threads about it, confirm it with someone else, or whatever, then update the calendar.  No need to just take my word for it (I never take any one person's word, without doing due diligence and research).  :)
---
EDITED TO ADD:  I was only looking at the "Web Link".  I don't know if the others are linked with that, or if they are different.
---
Agree, a Mothman Questline like Lying Lowe would be awesome.
---
And repeatable Event like Encryptid connected to it.
---
just message me on here or xbone. GT same as this
---
I guess that's what it is based on. There is a common variant, looking exactly the same, but more dark/reddish. The common one fits the common fireman outfit perfectly. I think the complete outfit can be found in the charleston fire department.
---
The white variant (helmet and outfit) is mega rare and event drop only. I asked for some infos here and was told the helmet would reach beyond cap limit / is trade only. Hope you didn't mean you gave this (responder fireman helmet in white) away...
---
Are you on xbox cuz my wife and I play together alot she started slow too but she just passed 60 I'm sure she would help you
---
Marine tactical looks pretty good in my opinion.
---
I just want the clean sink and Rustic sink to not give diseases. I‚Äôm okay with them giving rads and dirty water but I hate that I can‚Äôt drink from my sink without getting sick. Paid for the damn rustic sink and I can‚Äôt even use it because I don‚Äôt have the time to get a bunch of disease cures not stop at whitesprings every time I get sick from it.
---
Had the same problem when I automatically renewed my membership. Contacted support. Said it takes up to 72 hours.
---
[I think this is it](https://guides4gamers.com/sites/10/screenshots/2019/01/1920/investigate-saboteurs-work-terminal-2.jpg)
---
I reckon you better go get that BE Flamer. It is much rarer than the weapon you are trading him. I doubt it's a scam.
---
Why do they do cosmetic under armour skins?
---
Who runs around with no armour on?
---
Rant
---
I originally came on here to correct you from making the mistakes I made. However, to make sure I didn't make more mistakes I did my research and now I'm pissed. 
---
I made myself a spreadsheet as well and since I didn't like what I had seen I made a post. 
---
However I got vilified for making mistakes, one being starting on level 0 when we start at level 1, just like you. 
---
The other I wanted to correct you about was the length, that it's supposed to be "around 10 weeks", about 76 days at least that's what the no respawns video said I was referred to. I got frustrated, I wanted a hard date that NR gave so I re-watched. Except he didn't, he made a guess. 
---
So, frustrated, I sought the articles that he quoted. I came across this one that says "each will generally last for around 10 weeks..."
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/fPSas0ftnlgD0FcZNnMoL/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-introducing-the-2020-roadmap-and-76-seasons
---
And this one just says "begins June 30th and runs through mid September"
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
Both of those are ambiguous, nothing concrete, it just says "around" and "mid September"
---
Then I came across this one. This one that says "our 1st 10 week season starts..." And "can you beat Dr. Zorbo to the finish line before the 10 week season ends"
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/47XE9Dbh3weAd5kusOIA8p/fallout-76-update-20-patch-notes-june-30-2020
---
No "around", no "mid September", just "10 week season" repeated twice. 
---
So I'm not going to try and correct OP
---
No respawns guess may very well be accurate, mid September is closer to 76 than it is 70, I'm just saying I based my calculations on a different Bethesda article. OP may have too. 
---
And fuck Bethesda for not giving us a solid end date.
---
I too would love to lock the cycling lights.
---
It will make the game more interesting, but the drop should not hit the Prime Fissure

YES!  I did the same exact thing.  The Morgantown Airport is a great place to pick up dropped, damaged weapons.  They are also low level weapons, so it doesn't take many materials to fix them.  I knocked this challenge out in a few minutes.  :)
---
There are quite a few weapons that require no screws to repair, 10mm pistol for example. This quest was actually rather easy. I did one scorched run, repaired their crap weapons and was done pretty quickly.
---
If they let me replace the notification sound for when you complete a quest or even as a notification for when a specific event I've tagged is starting it would genuinely make me forget about some of the problems in facing
---
If you cant get out of it by walking out then just fast travel to somewhere nearby
---
Dukov?
---
I think one of the recent updates changed them to the wrong model
---
Back when fo76 dropped I was highly skeptic how it‚Äôs going to be turn out as a multiplayer game also as players can drop nukes etc. with experience of other mmo‚Äòs
---
But after two years one thing why I recommend to join fo76 is the community.
---
Sure, there are always some who can ruin your day but 95% of ppl I met are friendly, helpful and glad to help other dweller in need.
---
Just gotta check some boards were someone asking for help or support and you‚Äòll see what I mean.
---
I do sometimes.  Beserker builds use no armor for the most part.  One of my characters is that build.
---
See Mothman on the regular at Sacrament.
---
10mm pistol and basically any pipe gun. Most melee weapons are simple to repair too.
---
Probably 5% player base max, I dont get it :-)
---
Oof ok thx
---
OMG!  They could have that little girl who lost her kitten Lucy to mole rats, as the central character.  We could all be finding nice teddy bears for her, to consoler her over the loss of her little cat Lucy.  :)
---
You might try deleting the terminal after you set them up.
---
It supposed to be added in future update with everything else they're supposed to adding .üòí
---
That might be true
---
I would not say that the chance is low - this seems to happen to me maybe 33%-50% of the time if I immediately enter a server after leaving. That's why when server hoping, I tend to go the main screen and wait around a minute before entering a new world.
---
Did you change chassis?
---
Yeah I pretty much gave it away. Didn‚Äôt have the rest of the outfit so I didn‚Äôt care for it.
---
All this will do is make alot of people just not help in the event whatsoever and just go on their phones while everyone else works towards the event
---
It's one of many things that Bethesda has implemented and immediately abandoned. Maybe it will be reworked one day, but I highly doubt it.
---
There are quite a few items easy to repair that don't use screws or adhesive. Just sayin'-
---
Yeah at RR I started to make a ore run at the beginning as most focus on shooting everything that moves anyway.
---
If we got matching XP for looting Ore I think more ppl might jump in to win the event.
---
except for queens
---
Yeah but the "slice" from Gamepass is got to be WAY less than what they get for selling the whole game, and I'd bet that people who are already paying for Gamepass are less likely to buy Fallout 1^st because of the double whammy of they're already shelling out for Gamepass and and seeing the Fallout 1^st as another recurring expense.  Then if they stop paying for Gamepass they lose Fallout 76.
---
If I see one of those bases I turn around and go somewhere else.
---
People have requested this so often it‚Äôs now on [Bethesda Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)
---
My wife and I play 76 a lot together. We have our TVs set up in living room and sit next to each and play. We also play NW with another husband and wife.

I sold a mutants, damage while aiming and reduced weight fixer last week for 5000 caps.

You can just look at them to change them individually.

I would hope that VATS isn't enabled in NW, at least unless it is only on servers that players can opt in or out of.

I have this hat and it was blue but now mines red too. Think it‚Äôs a glitch and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll fix it.

Wasterlanders broke it. Well, it was broke before as the model was the wrong size but at least the colours were right.

Of course ur right! Since update 20 the event just spits ghouls at u!

Thx hope they change it back

Yep nothing to see lol
---
Fallout is now on ganepass, might see some peeps
---
Followup question: How far through the game's main questline are you?
---
It's one of the things people have been waiting for since launch. Supposedly it's still coming, but god knows if that's true. I imagine its having an impact on pa skin sales, once you have one you really like there's no point in buying one that's your second favorite since you'll never see it. For me that means my 51, 60, and x1 are out of the running for skins since I have the in game paints for them and I'm not going to cover those up, and are the ones I use. So I have the excavator and 65 to find one for then im done.
---
What system are you on?
---
Plumbing has nothing to do with the the sink. I can clean my sink all day and still pump crap water through it.
---
If they do it again  today, I will do it
---
I see thanks
---
Yeah sadly... 1200 Atoms/12‚Ç¨ each of course.
---
Eyeball helmet. Although that would have been my answer regardless as I bloody love that helmet.
---
Then the initial post falls under that statement :-)
---
What system are you on? I could help out a bit.
---
Do you mean eyebot? Or is that a rare helmet?
---
Modules reduce or eliminate the grind, therefore they aren‚Äôt cheaper. Completely random items are the grind. A 25% discount not making a difference in it clues you in to how much grind there is. 
---
‚ÄúWhat if we give them 25% off for a weekend on weapons and armor? ‚Äú
---
‚ÄúThat rounds to zero change in our revenue projections, go ahead‚Äù
---
Yeas in the vault 94 I had emergency protocol,maxed lone wonderer,maxed blocker and nerd rage. That was way over 100%+specific melee reduction,yet the 30 ghouls inside the raid could still melt me when swarmed.
---
So I did this last night and it worked, however today noticed the file had gone from my FO76 folder. I think you have to repeat this every time you reboot your PC.
---
EDIT - EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH THE GAME. WTF.
---
Ah, I see. Okay thanks.
---
Same with Laser/Ultracite Laser
---
It should be a paint plan if not repairable
---
I just always share green thumb. I have no interest in fighting, only farming.

Ur welcome Sir!
---
A. you did not specify what system
---
B. Trading isn't allowed on this subreddit, try one dedicated to Trading, it rhymes with Car-Kit76
---
Stating platform would help :-)
---
The mothman figures look good there, and some extra scarecrows
---
Stop by if you are on ps4!
---
 Its really nice on Xbox X I almost never crash everyone is really nice and welcoming. What system you on? It‚Äôs even better now with public teams always got someone to do stuff with.
---
Yeah it's great when a few players turn up, the xp is crazy, I can't shoot fast enough.
---
It‚Äôs depend on RNG, some people not getting any with hard grind but some get it with only few run
---
Launch a nuke on top of a new player - maybe they won‚Äôt know to look at their map or run
---
Raiders have an extremely easy and quick rep exploit. I feel bad for anyone actually grinding that faction
---
It doesn't matter as you will be able to join them both / max rep both. The one you initially choose just gets a hefty rep boost. Pick the one that has better reputation rewards for your playstyle as the one you side with initially.
---
I'm aiming for the ss armor,and the responses I got here will probably lead me to buying it every week
---
I bought the plans but have given up trying to roll stuff I‚Äôd use. Rolled so many pieces and only have 1 that benefits my build. Definitely get the underarmor plan and shielding mod though. They‚Äôre only 200 gold each and have strength at 4.
---
Keep looking: 'Finish 76 events while in a group and using a ranged weapon' etc.
---
If you mean the rocksy one I only got it to work once and every other time I back out after saying ‚Äúthe wasteland has a new corpse‚Äù it completes anyway,has it been patched?
---
There‚Äôs is no difference, really. In the end you‚Äôll be able to max rep both factions and be able to buy all their stuff.  
---
At the beginning there is a settlers-based quest that rewards the Chinese stealth suit.  That‚Äôs nice and you don‚Äôt have to wait until later to buy it.

---
Read ones should turn into a lighter misc item that can still be put on display just no longer read for the buff!
---
Or if keeping the buff, add a cooldown before being able to reread them!
---
Weird. I guess Godd Howard touches the wasteland in mysterious ways.
---
Put him IN THE TREE
---
That's awesome, thanks man
---
Buying duped weapons should be discouraged.
---
I'm not so sure about folks saying the game is a pvp grief fest still. I started playing after wastelanders dropped and one of the hardest things I found was getting current info on how things work now. Google searches turn up with all kinds of earlier issues that have been patched/changed/rectified but it was very difficult to tell how things exactly work now.
---
This game really is a good example of something I heard Miyamoto say once "A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."
---
Because the initial impressions on release never go away. You may fix the problems, but that stain will always be there in some way.
---
You‚Äôre already an omnivore..
---
Everyone is with you. But that won't change the fact the skin is for the combat alone.
---
Why do I get 25%from cranberry relish sometimes(herbivore) 20% other times and 10% other times?
---
Xbox.
---
I put biocommesh on my torso. If I could spare a few more end I'd put chem fiend back too.
---
The Devs are aware and it‚Äôs on the fix list (per Lady Devann)
---
Not with the double mutation buffs though.
---
One Violent Night definitely needs a buff. There are not enough enemies spawning at once.
---
And the Nightstalker shoul be lvl 50 at least!
---
try a trading subreddit.
---
Awesome, drop your GT, and I'll help you next time I'm on!
---
If you really have not done that quest line, then check your pip-boy for "Mistress of Mystery".  Seriously a favorite quest line for a lot of FO76 players.  You don't have to be very high level to do it, either.  Once you are done, you end up with a veil that protects you from airborne diseases, a cool pistol, and a cool sword.
---
Switch to another character to save that level up, and keep playing. My, young people these days, do we have to tell them how to do every small thing? ;-)
---
&gt;You can only have 1 disease at a time
---
You can get multiple different diseases at the same time. That's how I learned disease cure only works for for one disease per dose.
---
I have but though I'd try this too
---
I‚Äôve been trying to get this hat since beta on PS4 :( congrats!
---
Lol I used a shark skinned instigating pickaxe,swing speed,+1Strength for all my raid 94 runs. I still carry it as my melee for PA times.
---
Rule 10, No trading posts or Retired posts
---
It‚Äôs a PTS-specific action to allow them to test the event.
---
From what we know, it‚Äôs not coming to the game when it lands.
---
Here i am üòç thank you for sharing my camp
---
Well shit
---
Didnt buy FO1 so he wasnt happy
---
tbh I havnt really seen alot of scamming during this dupe-nacht parade
---
probably a duped item so he doesnt care what he trades it for
---
Just don‚Äôt stand on it at the queen :)
---
No worries my Quad/25/25 Handmade can handle it just fine... ra-ta-ta-ta all dead.
---
From 400 to 600 in two weeks, and finished the board already? Enjoy your ban, godmode exploiter!
---
For nuclear winter mostly.i'd take a secret service underarmir skin to prevent selling or scrapping mine tho.
---
Did you start on a free weekend I had to start another character
---
Met a few girls on PS4, maybe more if the random players actually used mic but so few people do.
---
The one with the perks that suit your build
---
I would like to know how you accomplished level 32 already without NW points.
---
Sounds like the same servers I get dumped into.  If I'm not launching them myself I can often play for hours across multiple servers and never see a single nuke.  Just happened again, played 2 and a half hours across a few different ones that the game randomly placed me in.  
---
Played a lot yesterday and saw one nuked Morgantown and a single SBQ that I launched anyways.  Used to constantly get placed on servers with back to back queens but haven't had that in at least a month.
---
People make games grindy by continuing to do it. It‚Äôs up to you, the individual, to find the fun in a sandbox like this. If you hate grinding, just don‚Äôt do it. Just explore, get creative with your camp, or literally the thousands of other things that can be done.
---
Military Cap
---
10% normal buff. 20% herbivore bonus. 25% herbivore bonus while in a group with Strange in Numbers active. ;)
---
Thx for answer ‚úåüèª
---
Thx was looking a long time for it to
---
Strange in numbers! Duh, thanks.
---
I find selling ammo at 1c and buying at other camps is way less tedious.
---
This whole conversation reminds me of this short, funny video.  I am a guy, but very polite and respectful to everyone.  I don't care if I am interacting with a male or female.  I treat everyone nicely, as long as they don't go out of their way to be a jerk to me.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISvFJw9JMlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISvFJw9JMlI)
---
Start a new character maybe. Makes it difficult and exciting again
---
The best legendary run that happened was that dupe that caused free legendaries to be shared all over!
---
Most people assume I'm a male player despite having a female character until I speak. So the silent people on your public team are not reliably all guys ;)
---
You can preorder these teddy bears on Bethesda store. Saw it the other day.
---
41, skipped 2-3 NW dailies.
---
Level 30, skipped every NW challenge so far.
---
37, gonna try to push 39 today.  the plushie shall be mine!
---
I can carry 445 without any carry weight perks
---
I‚Äôve not done any NW challenges either.  I think I‚Äôve only seen one legendary since SCORE started, I‚Äôm obviously in the wrong areas.
---
Sorry it was sold
---
Thank you sorry there was not more dragons
---
Buying from a vendor is not okay anymore?
---
"If you really are female"?! Women make up 50% of the gaming population. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women\_and\_video\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_video_games)  
---
I post my PS4 handle in this sub all the time.
---
30. Did all the challenges so far but didn't grind much the repeatable one
---
Sounds good to me. There are plantable floor tiles you can plant crops. And there have been flower box decorations in the Atomic Shop, plus trees.
---
I like the idea of a treehouse, similar to the buildings they have been putting in the game.
---
Totally worth it. I do it every week. I'm grinding to get T-65 power armor set, which requiers something like 8k gold for full set + jetpack, so i'm using all possible ways to get more gold
---
Lol, no problem!
---
A: item has been sold. B: thanks for your input...
---
36, only doing the NW challenges if they are stupid easy. like place a camp
---
Leader of the Pack and Uranium Fever both spawn 3 guaranteed legendaries, watch out for them popping up. One Violent Night is usually consistent with a few for me too. Getting on a decent server with people doing SBQ nets a few. Whitesprings. I always see/hear people getting legendaries at West Tek (I've never found any there ever bizarrely). Good luck.
---
Purified water might be a bit much, though. Maybe boiled water?
---
Rank 29.  I try to accomplish all the weekly/daily challenges, excepting the NW ones, but have missed hitting the level up challenge on a few days where my play time was limited.
---
I only have one character, I‚Äôd take no enjoyment in repeating everything for the sake of levelling up another one with no benefit
---
Please explain instead of just downvoting me, id like to learn and no-one is explaining
---
So many bloody builds fall to my junkies ffr +1 agility automatic gamma gun.
---
You shouldnt run Events like Feeding the people in the first place because there is almost no XP to gain. 
---
The only Events worth ur time re Monster Mash,  AWOL Armaments, Radiation Rumble, Heart of the Swamp, Guided Meditation, Surface to Air, Always Vigilant etc.
---
Same for bobbleheads
---
I see, thank you. Can I  ask how to get a name tag, like yours?
---
I have b√© and AAE GP, but I dont are agree
---
dont listen to this "u will be able to max both" YEAH, but in like 2Months of every single day logging and doing daily. Raiders have unique gauss minigun + ammo factory (the most importnant things) and foundation is only about gauss shotgun. Also do all the missions at foundation before you choose for example joining raiders , u ll get from that last mission before chosing faction CHINESE STEALTH  SUIT. If u join raiders like me without doing any foundation missions u gonna miss that suit cuz noone talks about it. U can buy it when u reach second highest rank in foundation BUT for 4K bullion, that is just insane and unfair
---
Get a set of unyielding or go deep pocketed
---
Dam this worked for me as well, had to do a search of my whole drive to find the file but it worked, thank you.
---
More parody blending in with reality.
---
Me too, only on a correct model.
---
If u install this mod ur no longer able to play nuclear winter. Just wanna let u know...
---
In the front page of this sub, look to the right side of the screen. Below "CREATE A POST" there is a tab called "community options", open it and you will see a user flair thingy. From there.
---
That is a user flair tag which you can choose by clicking the subreddit, clicking the three dots in the upper right, and selecting set user flair of which you‚Äôll be confronted with quite a few
---
Rank 35
---
475 / 1850
---
Edit: formatting
---
If you get stuck with that one it's easiest to start a new character and follow the main quest. You normally ding by the time you hit the wayward or flatwards. Not the most honourable method but it gets the job done if you are short on time.
---
100% needs to happen. That effect is pretty much useless on anything that has more than 1-2 mod options.
---
It's like "sweet this gun only weighs 1 pound!"
---
- seconds after modding gun -
---
"Wtf why does this thing weigh 19 pounds now?!?!?"
---
Only during the PTS I think.
---
Im in the same boat. Im a day 1 player so I remember the days when you couldnt even repair fort pricketts no clipping ticket dispenser. For how far the games come there seems to be alot of complaining.
---
Stack power armor frames, jetpack from the top one, you just need to get in the transfer menu, then you can take all!
---
I still gotta get to level 20
---
one wasteland on the roadmap has a "bombs drop" event,  maybe they are also testing / usong the trial version of the auto nuke for whatever that upcoming event will be?
---
There is even an old lady with her own youtube channel around... gamerMOM something something i belive.
---
Ah, I had forgotten about that. Thanks for reminding me!
---
Do people honestly have that hard a time finding a server?  I recently built on the junk and lead in the North and have only had to deal with it once. A quick re queue and I'm in a new server I've never found it to be that difficult.
---
Buying a duped weapon isn‚Äôt ethically kosher.
---
No worries he crashes his ship right on level 99 so u can catch up...
---
any chance of a youtube link to the original theme song?
---
I think he‚Äôs trying to tell you that should you choose to go Raider, then at least complete the settler quest up to the point of receiving the stealth suit for free.
---
They just work.
---
I asked the same question. Some legend posted this. I'm a smudge away from 28. No NW at all.
---

Unarmed full health melee is awesome. Blocker, barbarian, nerd rage, dodgy and serendipity.
---
In endurance, Sunkissed, rejuvenated, ad skeleton 
---
Healing factor.
---
Get an Instigating weapon, mix and match armor and you‚Äôre good to go.
---
You won‚Äôt one shot a SB, but they won‚Äôt one shot you either.
---
Well, we already have a chainsaw and skins for the fire ax. So, it's a start.
---
I think I‚Äôm like 30, unfortunately I have school again and will miss out on majority of the later ranks. On the bright side I didn‚Äôt really want anything so it‚Äôs nice I‚Äôve gotten what I‚Äôve got so far
---
Yes. Because it's possible that someone could impersonate someone else on the internet?
---
Hahahaha. Nice. Link to Wikipedia where the sources are all paid for articles that require subscriptions. There are far more males on consoles than females, females make up a large portion of mobile players, but on console? It isn't even close. Hence why this topic was posted at all.
---
This change would take away from the joy of finding them in the wild.
---
Can't agree more
---
Marine Helemt
---
Nope.
---
I did sorry my phone hates me!
---
PC has been a great experience. I‚Äôm sure if you write an email Bethesda will refund your fallout 1st sub.
---
Scorched inoculation is good.
---
Also recommend going to Pioneer Scout Camp North of Grafton to stay Pioneer Scout Quests
---
I am at lvl 33.  Missed 3 days because I was camping.
---
 Other than that I have done every daily and weekly except for one NW challenge.
---
Lvl 29. I‚Äôve done each day except the first. Did not always get every score every day but I do get the weeklies
---
He *is* the kwisatz haderach!
---
At least they have 2 daily tasks, 3 if you count Blakeye
---
Thank you for your opinions everyone, I‚Äôve msged him saying we got a deal
---
Try events. Uranium fever and leader of the pack have 3 each. Free range has 1-2. Project paradise usually has a couple. Radiation rumble a couple and of course the queen. 3 nukes takes care of all
---
Sorry to be late, but how does unyielding and max int help me on the grind? Does it draw in more xp?
---
Chef Ro-bar-dee?
---
There‚Äôs a new duping technique the last few days. It‚Äôs crashed the marked hard. Take advantage and grab your dream gun. Also try to chisel them down a bit.
---
If you are just starting out.. do the responder quest line .. if will give you the tools you need to progress
---
She doesn‚Äôt land when people stay on top of their tents, or at least infrequently. Makes the fight much harder for everyone and frustrating as she flies around forever.
---
Even the one where you log into a game drop Camp quickly 3 times in one spot then log out of the match? Free 250 score.
---
 I hate NW with a Passion but I still find ways to finish challenges without firing a single bullet at anybody.
---
Take both sides all the way till it says who to choose for vault raid. Then decide. And keep all the gold!  You do the work, you get paid!!
---
So you want a mutation for enhanced normal?
---
Brilliant
---
Not really was just making a passing comment about how a Legendary Perk that allows you to carry both of the mutations being discussed would be fun. 
---
Call it Wasteland Glutton or something haha
---
Preach brother! Can't tell you the number of times I've suggested this same thing, the ability to do basic plumbing. Should be no different that running electrical conduit.
---
As someone with the same kind of underground base, it‚Äôs really funny hearing a lower level player describe their experience finding one. Building seems very limiting initially, but spend enough time messing with all the various things you can do and you‚Äôll see you can creat underground stuff, in the wall camps, cave camps, floating camps, etc.
---
Aw... Thanks
---
Just got mine a while back. Do those ash heap events. That‚Äôs where mine dropped
---
Poke the gaming sites twitters with this, as content hungry as they are I bet a bunch of them run with stories about how their new pay to win system is broken and they refuse to do anything about it.
---
I tried man. Halfway through I gave up. Can you clean this post up a bit?
---
I would love to see random nuke zones all over the map.
---
There are so many places that provide for interesting nuke spots, but the cost of firing the nuke almost demands you aim for one of like 4-5 high value areas, 
---
It would be nice to see some of these low traffic areas get some nuclear love.
---
Pigs survived. They dupe legacies, Christmas presents, and continue to rationalize their acts.
---
Nightmare? Dont know about that. It's not all that hard and plumbing could be run the same way electrical conduit is now. Sure it can be a challenge to do something elaborate sometimes (getting everything to line up just right) but if you keep it simple, wouldn't be all that difficult.
---
You will need to constantly farm ultracite, lead and steel. I tried it but went back. For me the damage increase wasn't worth the time it took to make the ultracite rounds.
---
If you haven't already, check the first tab in the shop and see if any items are available for free for this month.  If you haven't claimed it already, i think it's an outfit or some nonsense.  
---
You may want a nice outfit to hide them hairy nipple dongs lol.
---
Would love to see that!  Yet another thing our personal console could be used for rather than gathering dust as a cosmetic decoration.
---
43, over 2k score xp per level now, reeeally slowing down
---
ahahah i probably came by
---
When it comes to the gauss rifle and lever action. I use the lever (instigating) as a big game hunting rifle. Getting a sneak, head shot with hat effect will kill most of about all mobs in game. Since .45 is really common it‚Äôs good for general and end game use. 
---
The gauss imo is best at end game. Looking at queen fights. The gauss does best at aiming and killing her spawns quick as can be and getting back to hitting her. A full charged shot will kill anything she tosses at you with a well place crit. 
---
Normally I would pick up an instigating lever quad gauss. But for you swapping their roles in fights isn‚Äôt too bad. You‚Äôll just bee needing to fire one or two more rounds off with the lever.
---
What platform are you on? (Pc,xb1,ps4)
---
Great idea until someone bails and you overloaded and can't move.
---
*Coloniser bot*
---
only model skins that swap the appearance are the ones in the atomic shop. specifically for a T-60 look there is the Black Rider
---
got a quad fixer
---
It's definitely one of the ones that drops less frequently. Outside of the jetpack, any mod that actually does something you would actually want on your PA seems to have crap odds for dropping.
---
I bought it after getting everything else I‚Äôve wanted, and I actually love the helmet. It‚Äôs not legendary, but it‚Äôs one perk is it has a super bright flashlight on the side. So when you use your flashlight with this helmet, your pipboy doesn‚Äôt light up. I also wear the mr pebbles backpack which usually lights up along with the pipboy light, but doesn‚Äôt if you wear the helmet. So it‚Äôs good for seeing in the dark better than you normally would. Is that worth 1650 gold? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

i get crashes now and then
---
try a reset. turn xbone on and then hold the power button for 10 seconds and it will go off. then turn it back on.

Is this a Todd Howard joke or are you telling me that they should just work? Lol
---
There's a point at 2:09 in the video where I open my map.
---
The chest and jetpack are an absolute game changer. Roll your perfect chest then apply the jetpack. By itself, the jetpack can lead to quick deaths. But here‚Äôs the secret about the jetpack... two pieces of 50% reduced fall damage are essential. They don‚Äôt have to be SS armor, any will do. Trust me, you can do some crazy shit without risk of dying if you‚Äôre wearing two pieces to completely nullify fall damage outside of PA
---
Both? :D
---
Oooh that's the good stuff.
---
I still like the idea I saw of allowing us to connect a clean sink to a water purifier to get clean water.
---
The only thing I really really really want üòâüòÇ
---
Sometime around when Wastelanders dropped, it seems like Bethesda went out of their way to totally screw up the lighting system.  At night, or in a dark building, I seem to have only two options.
---
1.  See nothing, because of a pitch black screen.
---
2. See nothing, because of a pure white screen caused by a ridiculously overdone glare effect on the PA headlamp.
---
I seriously sometimes get headaches from the constant stark changes in lighting from pitch black to ridiculously bright glare.  The eye strain is sometimes just too much, and I have to stop playing for a while.  This game needs brightness and gamma settings, like pretty much every other game has had, since the 1990s.
---
Nice post üëçüèº 
---
I just had to listen to it again..
---
https://youtu.be/i_7po_3Whl0

Someone commented: I think we‚Äôve found heaven lads!
---
It is cool.
---
Do the three available quests for BOTH factions before declaring your allegiance by choosing which faction you take into the vault with you.  (There is a very obvious warning when you are accepting the final quest that will lock you into your choice.).  If you do all three of the preparation quests you get a hefty amount of faction gain and, in the case of the settlers, both the Stealth Suit plans and a legendary SMG.  After that choose whatever side strikes your fancy.  Ultimately there is no permanent penalty for picking either and your can become max faction with both by doing the daily faction quests.
---
My personal advice is to side with the Raiders and honor your bargain with Meg for her share of the gold because that will accelerate your progress to their max faction and obtaining the ammunition machine.
---
Wait, is there a list somewhere that will tell me what i need to unlock the holiday stuff?
---
Looks cozy! Nice üòé
---
27, I think.
---
I stopped paying attention once I got what I wanted. However, now the extra dailies are added, I am hoping to get the Chicken Coop too.
---
Definitely. The grind for that armor is long, especially if you get the jetpack too which everyone should. So definitely yes, but from smiley every week.
---
got to 19 in 1st week thanks to the long weekend but at the end of week 2 I'm only at 25. unable to do the dailies most days due to work.
---
Cane to start. Then start the scorch inoculation questline and make your way through all of the original main quests. You can then return to do the other wastelanders main quests.
---
Why can‚Äôt we just get a water source that‚Äôs as quick as stream or lake? I‚Äôd pay atoms for that.
---
Touch√© Hahahaha
---
I'm Aussie so its probably a lot more.
---
Yeah I tried that a few times, no dice :(
---
How do you get these to reset?
---
How dare you? I'll display my hairy nipple dongs wherever I please.
---
By the way! I go into my map at 2:09 in the video and you can see the location there.
---
Xbox
---
I have been experiencing this for two weeks. I am in Egypt and have tried all the trouble shooting points from Microsoft, Bethesda and other websites power cycling, deleting stored data, hard resets .... name it. Bethesda have been useless in responding to their tickets. All other games work well though!
---
adding on: normally i get good luck finding legendary mobs in the burrows,  not to many people visit there so its a "low competition" area in my experience
---
secret service armor is only marginally more valuable than any decent set of armor.
---
I only bought the plans so there is a small chance of getting them randomly through the purveyor and companion quest rewards.
---
Otherwise the only reason to get them is you don't have good legendary armor already and want to roll specific pieces over and over, which can be equally achieved from thorn or solar armor, so if you already had those it's a question of vault steel.
---
Otherwise, the defensive advantage of going above 200 dr is so meaningless that you don't really gain anything from the improved stats, the 327 dr of buttressed secret service armor is not as big an improvement over the 193 of buttressed marine armor against most things because of how heavy the diminishing returns from armor get, Only against super powerful melee hits when not using any form of damage mitigation does the difference become significant, against most ranged attacks the difference isn't meaningful.
---
I am not saying the stats don't matter, but if a super mutant behemoth is hitting you a full set of marine armor with one piece of super mutant damage resistance armor will reduce the damage you take more than a full suit of secret service armor without.
---
Yes, I've noticed in my CAMP, the lights' effects have gotten absurd.
---
stolen this solution from /u/akarnokd (Thanks!!) and it is the only thing that worked for me. Im a bit late but maybe you still need this.
---
 
---
Are you running Windows 10 on a machine that has integrated and discrete card? For some reason since Patch 6 or so, you have to go into Screen Settings &gt; Graphics Settings, browse for Fallout 76 and set it to the high performance card. You may have to repeat this with the NVidia/Radeon card's own setup program.
---
I can taste the salt.
---
If you get more legendaries than you can scrap regularly it doesn't change anything honestly, eventually you reach full inventory stuffed with legendaries and then some people might buy more scrap kits at once to get rid of everything because it takes way too long otherwise.
---
Just started plain, same error to me
---
Yeah same here everything else works fine, classic bethesda
---
I think they should make this a rewards in a future season for sure
---
32, halfway to 33.
---
Radiation rumble is one of my favorites right now. We had most of the server in the event and they somehow let 3 of the scavengers die within 20 seconds.   I just want them barrels dang it! I‚Äôve had better luck in project paradise lately
---
Nope, that's an age old issue that's considered a common fix these days for any game and applies really to laptops. I got it working weeks ago. Using the Steam version solved my issue. I went from Bethesda launcher to Steam.
---
Just about to hit the the second chapter. So level 31
---
Hey, it is as if the BGS servers can‚Äôt handle the traffic and it has a limit on the accounts. I don‚Äôt know though? When all else fails I left to believe this. I have even used a VPn switching locations but nothing!
---
Rank 36, I have only skipped two of the NW dailies so far. Wanting to hit 50 for the cultist/raider looking tree.

---
SBQ fights are not a good source of XP. So no but thank you.
---
I feel like this is either in code or you just really like capitalizing things?
---
100% agreed...
---
Still a better love story than Twilight.
---
I mean... maybe?
---
The extra people in NW are wonderful and I hope some stick around.
---
He can spawn at the new camps now, the cultists can summon him at night.
---
I wish it was a ledger for vendor sales.
---
What made Fasnacht so good was that low levels could get involved too.
---
Dropping a nuke doesn't seem like it should be necessary to an event
---
I do
---
LOVE this, please more daily challenges bethesda, i hate finishing them in 2 minutes and then having to go play another game. Also more NW ones please, love that mode
---
Oh God yes please
---
There is a bug when you use the Nuke it doesn't land where you marked. Most of the time this happens. I've nuked my team and completely missed because of this bug.
---
What platform? I'm on PS4 and would love to launch a nuke sometime
---
It's not false, and I believe it's even stated as an in-game tip.
---
Ps4 yes
---
I‚Äôm level 31 and I didn‚Äôt do the NW dailies for the first 4 or 5 days but I‚Äôve been doing them since
---
Oh cool! I'll wait for some more people to reply but where you thinking of launching the nuke today?
---
Same. I've never a single scout mask or found anyone selling
---
Yea Im on now for a bit so looking to do em b4 the dailies reset.
---
I'm curious now, what's happening next month, and why upper center?
---
I think the bar is under floor decor. You might have to mouse past the Red Rocket one.
---
Oh. When do the dailys reset?
---
Can I put this on my ally‚Äôs chair so she stops playing that damn guitar??
---
I was so excited for 76 as it was supposed to be a survival game like 4‚Äôs survival mode. When I collected water for the first time and didn‚Äôt need empty bottles, it broke me.
---
I‚Äôd love this 
---
As someone who is level 178 and hasn‚Äôt ran a silo yet let alone beaten the base games main quest line 
---
I always have to rely on other people to nuke places and sometimes I go days or weeks without someone dropping a nuke on the server
---
And all you have to do is rename the custom file or move it, if you want to play again. Then move it back or rename the file to what it was before if you want to use the mods again.
---
They changed it to noon for some reason so I stay up later just to do them.
---
No wonder it took us forever to defeat her a couple of days ago. Someone was doing exactly this. I mean, we still got it done, but it took nearly the entire time allowed.
---
An event where we all get high on the vapors of the one that flutters by the street lamps üôÉ
---
FYI this worked for like 2 days until the game files said it needed repairing and the game uninstalled itself.

And most of my "team" sessions are me alone on my building team while three events teams ignore the less popular public events.
---
Oh ok. Well sorry about that I can't play until at least 1 or 2
---
another canvas bag fiasco? :)
---
Wait.... I played a bit at release and came back at fasnacht. I didn't notice the music changed!
---
It's the perk card you're sharing with a team
---
Because you are eating part of Harold (from fallout 3). Since it is mushroom shaped, you can probably guess which part.....
---
I wish the bars and vendors would snap properly. Seems I can only snap the bar to a vending machine and not a machine to the bar. This means I have to guess the space between a corner and hope I set it right to set up a bar.
---
Edit: seems it's only happening on floor pieces. I can set it up and both bars and vendors snap together on the ground but not on a floor. Wtf.
---
Does it affect anything if we have the same cards?
---
Most people assume that the missing mods are a bug, but I've never seen confirmation from Bethesda that this is the case. I assumed they just didn't intend this armor to have those mods. Perhaps to try and balance them, since they have the top stats of any armor, but not all the mods available. 
---
Most likely though, whether a bur or not, Bethesda will add them at some point in the future.
---
Turnets, the radioactive version of turnips.
---
Don't think so. Just any cards you or teammates share, everyone gets the effects. I think it might double the effect but I could be wrong
---
This comment is the answer. This glitch happens frequently all over the place.
---
You can lock the terminal so people don‚Äôt go changing the lights in your camp
---
Hey another female gamer here! I don't use mic but I do text chat through discord &amp; ps messages. Send me a chat invite on here and I'll drop you my psn :)
---
YOU HAVE FOUND SOLUTION!
---
Make mods weightless, easy!
---
Been playing since beta on Xbox! Feel free to add me texasMeg 
---
I don‚Äôt have many girl friends. Well I don‚Äôt have many friends to begin with üòÖ
---
Oh ok. Thanks!
---
Uh. I am op.  I just based it on 10 weeks cause when I looked it up that‚Äôs what I found.  I would guess it‚Äôs an even weeks rather than 76 days cause they always update/reset things on Tuesday. Anyways, probably better to base it on the smaller guess to be safe. And I fixed the level thing so that should be right now.
---
Just a heads up. My tests show that grenadier does not effect weapons with the explosive legendary effect.
---
I'm at Rank 26/100 atm.  Haven't touched Nuclear Winter since last year.
---
Level 28
---
So basically that person (who may or may not have been a dupper - maybe he collected these plans the same way you did) was dropping a bunch of stuff in order to distribute it to newbees or random people who show up to the trainstation. Then you came along, took the plans and want to distribute them to newbees?
---
Bravo! my feelings are not as Epic as yours, but well said. I appreciate the thought you put into it.
---
I did get into another chassis at one point, yes
---
What I would do is count the first week on there starting from tuesday. So Tuesday is one, wednsday 2, Thursday 3,
---
Friday 4, Saturday 5, Sunday 6, Monday 7. Each day will be 7 days from each other so just add a factor of 7 to find that day from there. So Saturdays for example (and to answer your question) are 5,12,19,26, etc.
---
Name change to hoarders lol, we have a problem.
---
Hmm I see I will buy them then
---
Doesn't exactly sound like the robin hood I know.
---
Starting a new character is really easy and makes a lot more sense than saving a level-up for the next day.
---
Oh and what do you mean by no respawns guess?
---
Ahh shiver me timbers that was soooo much moodier
---
And uses so much ammo. I just stop shooting after a I get enough hits on the SBQ until people get off of the tents. .50 cal goes quick!
---
Who‚Äôs blakeye?
---
Thank you for the offer, I'm on PC tho, but don't worry I have like another hundred in the stash ;)
---
they say dont say never right? well i guarantee you if they've heard of bethesda and todd howard they would say NEVER EVER. this is the only reason people subscribe for fallout 1st and you want to give people less incentive to be held hostage? hahahahha you're funny i'll give you that. There will not even be a kg increase in carry weight for free by beth. Screenshot this if you want.
---
A new boss is being added at Monongah Mine but to access it you need to nuke it and quickly get inside. The event is called a Colossal Problem and will feature a named Wendigo Colossus fight in the mines.
---
tbh Encrypted is easier to solo as bloodied then to do it with group
---
35 and skipped all the NW dailies. I think to get to 100, we should be at around 33 by tomorrow.
---
No, it‚Äôs just teddy bears from their gear site.
---
Wendigo Colossus event in Monongah mine.
---
Oh yeah. She's a bullet sponge for sure. The Wendigo is the same, just not as bad but you can tell the massive Energy, Explosive and Damage Resist buffs they have.
---
I think I'll need like 8 tents, LOL... or maybe that glitch that made you jump so high that you killed yourself aaand the tents.
---
It breaks it. You can keep the 60 60 60 as long as you don't change chassis
---
Exactly. It sounds to me like the naked low level was already doing just that. He Was dropping plans for others to come get for free.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Blackeye
---
Same. I regret having maxed out lone wanderer on my characters
---
throw the Mistress of Mystery in there ...even in the early days of this game, most people enjoyed this quest line
---
Already did that one, but thanks anyway
---
They shouldn't have taken my money when I wasn't subscribed in the first place is the thing. They want to take from my wallet, I will take from theirs. Theres no asking nicely to a shadowy corperation
---
Alright, thanks
---
I'll do that then, thank you
---
Yeah. Common misconception of dupers. People think they are just greedy. But all those hard to obtain items get distributed out to everyone else through trade or give away making rare weapons and what not more obtainable to everyone else. People say they ruin the game. But they defy Bethesda‚Äôs difficult grind  and give back to the players...doesn‚Äôt that make them the wasteland Robin Hoods?
---
Go get 'em tiger.
---
Playstation. The system shouldn't matter when they are taking money from my bank account when I wasnt subscribed.
---
No problems here, actually have it nestled against a fusion generator and windmill. It should snap directly behind the lip of the counter.
---
&gt; Arthur Maxson is a disgrace to his ancestor's memory.
---
Arthur Maxson is the only elder in the entire brotherhood's history to get the ideology of the faction right.
---
I know it‚Äôs a bit late but thanks for posting so I didn‚Äôt have to! Best of luck to you in your adventures my friend...
---
Crashing isn't the point. It's the fact money was taken from me when o wasnt subscribed or using a service.
---
If you don't like grinding, don't play an MMOs. I'm not thrilled about the grind either, and sooner or later, I'll stop playing until the next update (I still have quest content I haven't done), but this is what MMOs are and always have been.
---
FOMO only matters if you let it.
---
Flair checks out.
---
yes. throwing nukes across a city is TOTALLY what Roger would want.
---
It does on the ground. But not on a floor panel.
---
do things that get you lots of xp
---
server hopping while looking for events with lots of mobs like line in the sand. running through the westek building and killing supermutants for xp. Meanwhile using buffs to get an xp boost. Lots of different ways
---
Seeing as they were dropping literally hundreds of stacks of rare plans such as Santa crash and plasma grenade plans, just to name a few I might add right in front of the vendor needed to use the dupe glitch.  I doubt they had less then honorable intentions.
---
Exactly.
---
12. I can't get on everyday.
---
And that's ok. :)
---
maybe you should play fortnite they did a travis scott event
---
Maybe if they squashed some bugs we might be inclined to believe them
---
This is well thought out!
---
Rank 40, 500 SCORE fromrank 41, haven't been doing NW dailies, just been grinding XP for SCORE with the time I would waste.
---
Anybody in this thread smoke weed?
---
It's just water freshly imported from Flint, Michigan.
---
*waves* hi! woman who plays 76 here.
---
I think one post is enough
---
haha it said it hadn't posted, my bad
---
That'd be nice AF
---
Yes, but it will require loooooots of xp farming, like alot alot. And/or using atoms. Considering you get around 25k (if the reward amounts remain the same to what we have now) score a week from challenges (7 weekly ones + 9 dailies each day). If you farm the same amount by killing stuff/doing events, you need to farm 2.5 million xp. As an example with Int 40 with rest bonus and inspirational perk, i get little under 400 xp for one high level super mutant. That said you gain 1500 atoms total from the whole shabang. Meaning you can buy the last 10 levels with that amount. The levels that will be the most brutal to get.
---
I remember back when Graham's Meat Cook first happened, I gave a few fusion cores to this one girl because she needed 'em and I had a few to spare. She seemed nice. They're out there.
---
i had just started (level 20ish) when legendary run was added. just kinda feels like extra free stuff to me as i climb.
---
It‚Äôs a misnomer.  Regions rotate dailies, so the 4 in the mire are one each day then the cycle resets.  Forest skips a day for its 2 for some reason, cop a squatter you can do every day if you talk to the robot.
---
It‚Äôs all around... dumb...
---
Start/Join an Event Team.  Once there's 4 players total and you hit max Bond, you'll be earning Quad XP for completing Events.
---
EDIT: Correction, 100% more XP.  Not Quad.
---
So he stole from robin good and now he wants a pat on the back.  Sounds more like the sheriff of Nottingham to me.
---
I bought it once, and honestly I didn‚Äôt think it was worth it. I‚Äôm usually always at max caps, so I give caps away to my gf or my friend.  I figured I should spend the 6,000 caps and get some extra good. But 6,000 caps just for 300?? Not worth it at all. 
---
Sure, I could easily get 1,400 caps back by selling stuff to the vendor. And also get caps by doing events and my quests. But in my opinion, for that much caps, it should be a little more gold. 
---
Assuming I do my daily treasury runs, I get 200 gold each day. That‚Äôs 1,400 gold a week. That extra 300 gold doesn‚Äôt mean much to me. Or make such a big difference. 
---
Unless you‚Äôre trying to buy something and it just so happens that you just need a little bit more gold. Then sure, bite the bullet and purchase some gold. Otherwise in my opinion. Not worth it.
---
So, do we have to have maxed out our SCORE (excluding the infinitely repeated 100 for leveling) *every single day until the end* to get all the rewards?
---
Because if so, I might as well stop now because I missed like a lot of the start.
---
Depends on how good that double score weekend is going to be. I know I'm going to be grinding it hard cause I've missed a few days.
---
Any bet that there‚Äôs a sheepsquatch farm hidden
---
Developing a new engine from scratch would alone take a few years. With backwards compatibility it would take even longer.
---
A better approach would be to start a new project (in other game series) and build a small new engine for it, and with newer versions keep updating it, getting it to be compatible with the existing engine. Then there would be a migration moment. It would still be painful but it would bring those opportunities some of us want.
---
You can make it faster by just pressing space and enter at the same time, the selections stay the same. But yeah... definitely stupid that the terminal can‚Äôt do math for you. Stupid computers.
---
yep, out of the total 100 you can gain around 10 free levels worth of atoms, save them till the end and boom. final boost. the atom transactions take effect in a few more days. plus there is always heavy XP grinding.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Actually, don't think this particular dupe glitch involves plans.  They may have gotten plans from the previous one but not this one.  Maybe opened up a bunch of presents.
---
I was at a queen fight when the previous one was going on and someone dropped a bunch of plans.  Picked out what I didn't know and moved on.
---
They were probably just dumping weight.  Each plan weighs 0.25.  Adds up quick
---
So, this is a game designed for the player to gather things, kill things, gather things, repeat... if you don't have the scrapbox, you're pretty much carrying too much of everything, everytime, that's the way the endgame is engineered if you're not willing to pay monthly in top of the initial 60‚Ç¨, this is the way. And you are telling me I'm hurting myself because I'll go play one of the only endgame content events that is still some fun with the risk of losing something you admit one does not really need? If I were to complain about the lost materials, I'll get it, but I have pretty much accepted the situation if other player takes it if I die (probably to stash it in the infinite-box-of-things-I-dont-need-anymore and forget), the problem is not that, is the game, for some reason, spawned my bag half way to the moon and the zetans have more chances than me to getting it. The materials are gone, I'm ok with it and don't care, if I have to choose between playing the game and stash materials, I know what I'll take, thanks.
---
No need to get triggered over something that is easily solved with an email. There‚Äôs people starving and living horrific nightmares and your having a tantrum about your own lack of action.
---
I would say so. It looks like The developers are finding out that the math was too brutal to hit 100 compared to other games with passes and have already made adjustments (9 dailies up from 7, double daily score period, etc). I wouldn‚Äôt expect these changes and adjustments to be the only ones. Plus you can burn through the last 10 levels with the atoms you earn (those will be the highest score levels).
---
If it makes you feel any better pvp damage in normal game is capped ridiculously low for the damage output I can do with a bloodied gauntlet. Hitting for over 1k on mobs is one thing but players is unlikely.
---
35, I skipped 3 or 4 NW dailies. No exploits, but I'm running 5 chars (which I'm in the process of respec'ing and outfitting for max INT), and doing the dailies on each of them alone nets me 30k XP each session ( = 3x 100 score).
---
It's changes the way you play and it is extremely hard to go back to the way it was before if you only want it for 1 month don't do it
---
What‚Äôs the error code? Can‚Äôt place w/ existing?
---
Yeah, happened to me several times, it sucks, but at least that is still lore friendly lol it sucks but a in a little lesser way.
---
I have been able to do it the other way around, I can‚Äôt snap a vendor to a bar, but I can snap the bar to the vendor. What‚Äô I‚Äôve been doing is putting the vendor down, then placing the bars.
---
I‚Äôve set myself a target of step 71, as probably as far as I will get
---
Ok, I feel you bro. People are just assholes or plainly selfish about this.
---
BUT it is not really their fault in an mmo world, to behave like this and put the rest of the players in a difficult position.
---
It is on Bethesda's interest to design their multiplayer game in a way that you are not losing exp. or rewards if another player shows up. I would prefer to have afk people leeching exp. than to not to kill a single mob.
---
Yesss G!
---
30 also skipped the NW challenges
---
Wouldn't say perfect, but it's a nice one indeed
---
eh this is the first game i've been "sympathetic" to the raiders in. i've never been able to click with the "bad guys" in a game before.
---
I guess a lot of bonus points from the 10k xp challenge?
---
Make sure you‚Äôre well rested, join an intelligence boosting public team and get the inspirational perk, eat/drink cranberry stuff, take berry mentats, use a leader bobblehead... then kill stuff.
---
From what I've read, the dupe glitch involves selling to an NPC vendor, and plans can't be sold at a vendor. This was most definitely not a dupe.
---
It's the Perk you're sharing when part of a Team.  Another thing being, the Number represents the Level of the Perk Card.  Depending on how many points you've placed on Charisma, example: 
---
3 Charisma =  Perk Cards up to Lv. 1.
---
6 Charisma = Up to Lv. 2.
---
9 Charisma = Up to Lv. 3.
---
12 Charisma = Up to Lv. 4.
---
15 Charisma (Max) = Up to Lv. 5.
---
I have catched a bizarre amount of junkies and bloodied guns these last couple of days
---
Dudeeee me too! My brain completely forgot the original. I'm sad now.....
---
Thats one reason I'm so glad the new SS armor is so cheap to repair.  Even with my weakest gun, I tend to wind up tanking the mob after one hit while I wait for others to arrive. And thats on my squishy stealth sniper. My 1-punch melee character can't even go unarmed anymore, and has to nerf himself by grabbing a random lead pipe or miner gauntlet. Really wish I could find one of those 90% wt shovels.
---
Best. Rant. Ever.
---
 Recommend watching this as it will speak for itself.
---

---
Lol, don‚Äôt need any perks in shotgun. All you need is a magic shotgun (a legendary with limb damage). One shots most enemies aside from known tanks (SBQ, mirelurk queens, sheepsquatch etc.)
---
Edit: you need to use vats for it to work. I have a level 15, 2 star zealots shotgun with +50% limb damage that can take down a lvl 80 regular scorchbeast in 3 vats shots with no perks whatsoever in shotguns. Works even in power armor.
---
The generators are small vault tec generators and are/were atom shop, I believe. And you can stack them!
---
Possibly. Now everyone will carry a level 1 auto energy around and laze their teammates in power armor. GG.
---
The double score is just double score on the dalies.  Doesn't include weeklies or weekly repetables.
---
None of the effects are doubled, from what‚Äôs been tested.  You just get the effects of the highest ranked card active.
---
Insist. I got it scraping gatlings
---
Thanks for clearing that up!
---
You mean the re-remaster. Skyrim was already re-mastered as the Skyrim Special Edition
---
34, finish all dailies n weekly, not heavy xp grinding
---
Sell them cheap. People who need guns for scrip will buy them
---
If you like low framerates, rubberbanding health bars and 95% VATS misses, 1VN is the event for you.  I avoid it even on a private server.  That barn is the laggiest place in Appalachia.
---
Water well is if you do it properly. Use the ‚Äòdrink‚Äô option first then spam the collect button while the animation plays.
---
about 300xp into score 69
---
Thanks for your offer, but I'm trying to get all the mods plans for my character, so no need to worry about this, I think I'll farm more events and will get it eventually.
---
I genuinely thought all the mods can be obtained either by scrapping the weapon, or buying from vendors, I didn't expect that the plans that are not part of seasonal events will require so much farming, that's why I made this post.
---
Definitely, theres so much they could do with it alone.
---
ah, ok, thanks for the clarification and sorry for the misunderstanding. i follow the same. its just digital stuff, and "regrowing" anyways. so what!? *shrug*
---
All Rise is trash lol. Literally any drop from a legendary enemy is better
---
Sure is bold to make a game no one asked for. Not only that but jam-pack in the worst features of mobile games (time-gating, cash shop, grind for premium currency) and an MMO (weaker quests, less world depth, and a subscription). Also I don‚Äôt know anyone who asked for FO:76 battle Royale. Everyone I know who is a fan of Elder Scrolls and Fallout wanted co-op. The only thing we can hope for is the new code that made this game will allow that in the future. But given that there isn‚Äôt much incentive with all the overpriced cosmetics people are buying, idk what to expect from Bethesda anymore. Hopefully modders can do what Bethesda won‚Äôt.
---
One week? Yes. Real issue is when you miss around 3 weeks to a month.
---
All of the snapping is fucked up. If any 3D modelers or animators at Bethesda played this it would have been fixed.
---
There isn't one. The vendor just gets a red outline and won't let me place it
---
You cant add junk when you dont have first but you can definitely use it. So I hoard everything I can get my hands on when I do have first
---
Like kittvskarr said, it's worded "Double dailies" in community calendar. Meaning we get double amount of dailies? Not double score. Here's hoping it will be double score, but i doubt it.
---
That one. Lots of lvl 25 rewards
---
Yeah, and? 2002, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2015, 2018. The six release dates for the six titles that have repurposed the same engine. They have had 18 years to develop a new engine. And, considering it's the last two games that most of the community has actually complained about, they haven't even released a game worthy of our attention, using said engine, in 9 years. Chief complaints in Fallout 4 were story and clunky engine repurposing.     
---
What you're suggesting would get us a new engine by 2026 or later, which means the first mainline Bethesda game to feature it wouldn't be out until at 2028-2029 at the earliest. With their team size, they could be developing the story of whichever game is coming next, probably ES6, alongside a 3-4 year engine development. Another 2-3 to actually make the game, and we're looking at 2026-2027 release. And this is all if they started tomorrow. This new engine should have been started after 4's release.
---
Set your lights, remove terminal , sleep better at night :)
---
That jet pack is a game changer!!!
---
Exactly, it hurts for about exactly 3 seconds, anyway. Forgive me if I was too harsh in the response, I'm tired of people telling others how to play the game 'correctly' and had this exact discussion in Discord just before seeing your comment :)
---
I‚Äôm sorry for ya...
---
Guess we can‚Äôt get all the nocturnal rolling pin 
---
Better luck next time!
---
They are used for toilet paper after you read them...
---
Lol at people who downvote just because they hate mods. Mods =\= hacking get over yourselves.
---
Man your early days reminds me of me and my friend. We played The beta just Explorer The world. starting from 76 walkin up to The lumber Will to fight of The mutants waking down to White spring and killing our first scorch beast (with help from White spring security) we wasted tons of ammo used stimpaks till we were out.
---
After a few beta sessions we were in The need of materials to repair and build weapons and ammo so we looked on The map and decided to go to The glass cavern and holy crap If we werent in for a war barely lvl 20 we went throug The East bend tunnel fought out way out and ended up on The other side of The tunnel. As we made our way to The glass cavern we tried to go through watog ultimatly dying by a assultron guarding The exterior of The city. We lobbed grenade after grenade stim after stim to takt it down. While we did manage to kill it there was more down The line
---
Since we were almost out of everything we decided to build up my camp outside of The city to try make some ammo and meds. What we found nearby my camp was an high lvl mirelurk Queen. My friend suggested we should try to kill it so with our remaining supplies we built a little fort and set up turrets to even out The odds. My friend would run up to The mirelurk Queen and lure it to my camp and while it did work it kind of didnt.
---
The Queen would send her minions of hunters, kings and softshells to destroy The fountation while she spit acid on us and The turrets. The turrets tho didnt help much since she was 1 out side of their range and 2 they died by her acid
---
Well this is me and my friends beginner story hope you liked it we died but had a lot of fun in The process
---
And to clarify; Ranger Armor is just an outfit, no actual armor and no need for repairs.
---
Yes, he's a modern-day warrior, mean mean stride
---
If you are on PC, I believe Nexusmods has a mod to silence them. I have not tried it yet but I am very tempted.
---
Jep, my dumb ass found it, after looking for way too long.  üòÖüëä
---
I only get broken Chinese officer swords. A shit ton.
---
I got a couple of friend who no-life‚Äôd the game and hit 100.
---
Youre 45 so the way you farm exp is a lot more limited than someone 20 levels or even 10 levels above you. Your best bet for farming exp is finishing the main story and doing events when in a full team whenever possible. 
---
Focus more on doing spread damage and hitting enemy's a couple times instead of trying to kill them. You get exp if you hit them once of twice and someone else kills them so your goal is to look out for high level players follow them around and tag all enemies near them.
---
If possible, its best to just change the team to events team when doing events and then switch to building for the INT boost between events, which will give you more XP for killing mobs etc.  
---
\*EDIT\* Even better if you can swap it mid event for the boost to the event reward and the INT boost for kills during the event.
---
Read nudes instead of nukes lmao
---
Guess it‚Äôs time for coffee.
---
Or, submit a bug report
---
I guess BGS thinks herbivores are actually pescatarian?
---
Purely cosmetic though on the collecting things for you right?
---
Would that benefit me when I do my Dailies?
---
I just use penta barrel because it looks chad as.
---
Big gun go brrrr
---
Simple fix is to allow players to get xp/credit for all kills/interactions as long as they "in" the event.
---
Its one of the fastest ways to farm exp/score. With only a couple exp boosts and one standard grenade launcher I was able to get over 30k exp (300 score) in one full event. I wasn't even tagging everyone and missed a couple waves.
---
So teammates leave and you become over encumbered and can't run or fast travel anywhere, not good :-)
---
I was think about the good old days when WhiteSprings would spawn infinite robots the other day, that shit was fun trying to fight wave after wave of robots.
---
Not yet.
---
I‚Äôm actually enjoying it.  Each new unlock gives me a little sense of accomplishment.
---
Let's not and say we didn't.
---
It is poorly designed... .  Don't defend it, they need to change it
---
2% more xp for each point of intelligence. With public teams, Lover's Embrace, herd mentality and cranberry relish you get double XP everyday.
---
There is no plan, you have to learn it through scrapping.
---
It's basically another water pump, it's only really another item for people who have camps far away from water sources to get dirty water they can boil and use for cooking, but yeah, the whole idea behind it being a clean sink can give off the wrong idea, however to be fair sinks by themselves were never really purifiers, unless in the fallout universe all sink faucets were equipped with some mini filter or something.
---
But what do you benefit from it? Surely it‚Äôs just a waste of time because I‚Äôm doing all the same quests for no reason?
---
If only things had volume switches..
---
By guys, you mean 13 year old turds
---
Quad on lever action is nearly useless, the reload/shot is quick enough you can afford to never reload it fully. ( speed demon and that perk giving rifles improved reloading
---
I can help you out, may need a little scrap but thats all
---
I've done the even twice and have the suit....
---
PC, yep!
---
With the Legendary Run, I‚Äôve been taking and defending workshops I happen to run across just for a little extra xp.
---
Horrid feeling when no one shows up but glad it worked out.
---
It is so FrustratingÔøº! I just want a square bar!!!!!!
---
Cheftron is scarier than any deathclaw ive metüòÇüëå

I bet there will be a fixer skin next week in the atomic shop

Psn=BoSAC-Sc-Choubi
---
Yes, absolutely worth it. I purchased about a month ago and has quickly become my favorite Playstation game by far, excluding Playstation All Stars ‚ú®
---
I ran out of every caliber of ammo I had. Not just my main 3 weapons, but I used their stash box to fish out anything/everything I had in there. I think I even used the Alien Blaster a couple of times.
---
Eventually, I quickly zapped on over to the train station to hit up the vendor and ammo box.
---
I made it back in time for the finale thankfully. To be honest, I really prefer helping clean up the ground clutter more than fight Skyrim dragons.
---
Why? Is an annoying event that takes forever. This way can be completed real fast
---
I‚Äôve got extras for pretty much all the PA plans. I did crafting for the first year or so of the game. If you want to go through them, you can have whatever you are missing.
---
no problem, good luck!
---
Oh really??? :((((((

DaGuerre has a ton of bugs too. Personally I ran into a huge issue with her quests where someone is supposed to spawn in and talk with her. They would load in but just sit there, never initiating the dialogue. Finally got it completed after reloading about six times. Moving her terminal around my camp didn't seem to matter.
---
Penta indeed need to rebalance, attack rate only little higher than tri barrel but wth is the dmg drop
---
Boys play this game. Girls play this game. Gender neutral plays this game. And helipcopters play this game.
---
Yep it‚Äôs a bit of a missed opportunity but as for all cryptids imo
---
Getting a little bit Background Lore, the holo tape plays tied in and an event to trigger.
---
But since it‚Äôs all about massive grinds lately I can‚Äôt see it coming tbh
---
That would be amazing.  I have one arm and one leg so far hah.  I have it written down on my PC.  I can check shortly to confirm.  Thank you so much!
---
You could try placing on a rug but it might stack funny. Sometimes the best option is to just to do a camp rebuild, which sux, but might fix the prob.
---
I have saved 1500 atoms for it, especially the hat
---
Chef Ramseybot 9000
---
Cool I'll watch it again
---
Especially since I can't let my teammates know that I'm encumbered and unable to move onto the next event.
---
There really needs to be so much more story
---
I‚Äôll pm you. It‚Äôs no problem, folks helped me along, I like doing the same for others.
---
Ok bro give me a min
---
" **I've been enjoying 76 but the bugs are killing me.** "
---
Yea, those Bloodbugs, Stingwings, and Ticks can be a handful. You can do that one daily that gives you a bug repellent which can help.
---
Yea we got a chick in our group who play regularly with us. 
---
If you want to ply with girls you might be better off searching for a girl only multi game clans or guild.. and maybe they have a fallout76 section
---
Yup but let‚Äôs wait and see.
---
Since therea still the auto complete issue for some which makes it a little bit tricky nevertheless.
---
You‚Äôre not my dad.
---
All good
---
True, that garbage has hit me 3 times now lol
---
Everyone on here saying "nuke=mothman"
---
Like nah, he's been around since the invention of Virginia. If we have a festival for the Mothamn, it should be like a small group of cultists, and they're trying to summon him. You are asked to help, and the event begins, similar to the riding shotgun event.
---
You have to gather wood and entrails for a large alter, and fight off waves of carnivous creatures. The longer the event takes, the more cultists show up to help.
---
When you have all the supplies needed, you light a grand blue fire, and shortly after the vengeful mothman shows up, turns the cultists hostile, with several being legendary, and then you have to kill them all. 
---
The mothman, on defeat, turns to a cloud of regular moths, and drops the usual loot.
---
AND PLANS FOR A MOTH WING JETPACK THAT FLAPS AS YOU FLY.
---
Man of culture
---
I clicked on the link without hesitation... so glad it wasn‚Äôt a rickroll
---
I forgot which number it is but the second tier you get atoms, right before the excavator armor skin.
---
Done every challenge so far aside from a couple of the NW ones- Mostly the "kill creatures" ones and the "heal a downed player "one.
---
Gaining a level is worth 500 so one extra 250 challenge doesn‚Äôt make up for it. Just saying so you are not skipping it thinking that the extra challenge evens it out.
---
All the time here on PS4. I got a lot of junk, though.
---
You are 85 years old so would make me at least 100
---
Angry Turtle did a video about this - https://youtu.be/AwWhC437yyQ
---
I made a chart assuming we have 10 weeks (not 7. Still waking up) that I posted here. Give me a sec and I‚Äôll edit this with a link (since I posted it last night and it never got upvoted so it‚Äôs buried now).
---
Edit: here ya go

So by the end of today you‚Äôll want to be at least 31 or better 32. And by the end of this week you‚Äôll want to be around level 33 (or close to it). Honestly because of weeklies end of week is more accurate cause depending on if you‚Äôve done your weeklies will affect where you are.
---
It usually lags when I'm scrolling through my hoarde of outfits
---
It gets worse the more that's in your inventory. Best thing to do is lose all the unnecessary stuff like notes and holos and any junk you don't use.
---
Ouch. It‚Äôs ridiculous as it‚Äôs still an issue since atom challenges
---
Oh sweet
---
Just sit back and wait until all the shills show up to this thread and spam the AAA video game publisher lies they've been spoon fed.
---
(¬¥„Éº`)y-~~
---
I'm literally LMFAO at the people that still desperately try to shill excuses for microtransactions in paid games (no, "cosmetic only" is not acceptable), season passes, incomplete games with stuff held back and charged for post release, pre orders, etc.
---
Video games are being ruined and the shills keep shilling, meanwhile all games are being designed for GRINDS now because it benefits companies psychological manipulation to pressure people into spending money on microtransactions.
---
It's not even surprising that people didn't push back and outright slam bethesda (most likely zenimax responsible though for the monetary push) for this new seasons system which stripped away our daily/weekly atom challenges and now they throw a disgusting fraction of atoms at us in this new seasons system.  The game got worse and people were placated by bethesda saying "look at all this stuff we're giving you" even though with the old system we could make a gpod number of atoms and CHOOSE our rewards from atom shop (even though so much of the atom shop is just asset flips from fo4 or items already in 76).
---
Yeah but what about the arrows? Im not actually sure if you coudm convert arrows as idont have the converter but i think areows are convertible. Barely anyone buys them
---
Indeed.
---
yup game can be real rough below 50.
---
With proper bloodied build the bloodied one will out dps the furious one by quite alot. Like alot alot. More than double the dps actually.

Yes and it wont just be a skin
---
I'm looking forward to the double xp weekend. Iv already missed a few days to too work and a new born. I'm hoping with the lunch boxes on top of all the xp boosters I can catch up during that time.
---
Wait.... Does anyone remember the original atomic shop music?
---
Honestly, they should nerf bloodied when they release all of the level balance changes in One Wasteland. Bloody's been fun, but it's ultimately booooooring.
---
After it got added to the gamepass I‚Äôve started sitting at the overseers camp and handing out weapons and fasnacht masks
---
Edit: extra thanks fort the dmg calculator link
---
This is the best idea I've on this sub!
---
For me it's definitely worth it. The extra damage to scorch and the extra ammo you can craft for the same steel and lead, is why I went prime. Same with my LMG (extra ammo is an even bigger increase for .308).
---
Like others have said, explosive doesn't work on the queen and speeds up weapon degradation. But you can only use what you have.
---
Every time I place or take out a weapon/armor or outfit. Then I have to wait patiently a minute or two before I can scroll the inventory again. But only on my main character(PS4). This happened after the second anti duping patch attempt more than a year ago. Or maybe it's just a coincident with me reaching the limits.
---
I would rather they give me credit for having them all first.
---
Until the server crashed :D
---
WhiteSprings was awesome with the mad spawn rate of leg glowing ghouls though. I remember bags and bags of discarded legendary stuff littering the floor outside the clubhouse. I got an exploding Tesla shotgun from there - still OP as hell against normal mobs.
---
I'm resigned never to get that 100 rank final reward. Unless I buy the rest of the way, I guess. We'll see. it depends on the cost. Anything over $ 10, I won't do it.
---
no, heh, /s means /sarcasm
---
I thought it was gonna be 150 atoms a pop? If it's 15 atoms a pop it will be neat
---
Woah this ended up being lengthy, hopefully something here helps someone.
---
Small amounts of exposure over time, too much was abrassive. Difficulty is growth, you start to learn and become more comfortable, or eventually you get used to it and stop caring so much.  Takes time.  My philosophy is you WILL die in NW and that's okay, it's part of the game. So you might as well enjoy what brief existence you have and just try again.  
---
Also, realizing that you dont need to be scared of other players is big.  They arent all apex predators, many of them are just like you and me, the only difference is how much confidence and practice some have (not including exploiters/hackers, but I dont see this on xbox).
---
Also, once you learn the map and start knowing where things spawn it gets so much easier, you know dedicated NW players know various starting spots to grab power armour, high tier weps, nuclear stuff, etc.. learning some good spots would be a good push to get you there too.m, get that advantage.
---
Many players actually avoid combat till later on because its risky, I've seen many skilled players hideout from time to time or even skip the opportunity to ambush a player. Other times when I'm outgunned I've managed to just run away. It's okay not to fling yourself into combat, your matches may last longer.
---
Getting a solid build in NW makes it easier and less frightening as well.
---
Lastly, you can learn from others if you play on a team and actually work together. But playing solo is also a great teacher, since surviving on your own can be tougher and builds you up faster I feel (as long as your not afk in a bush the whole time). I would give both modes a fair chance, i say this because i know people who are petrified of one or the other and they are missing out on the experience.
---
Probably helps I'm a bit of an adrenaline junky. I'd jump out of an airplane again if given the chance. I still get shaky during really intese matches.
---
I guess if you consider new cars/outfits(money sinks) and maybe a couple guns or missions as "major content updates".  Consider this is the top grossing game of all time!  600 billion... the game gets one pretty good content update a year and a bunch of shop additions, true content updates over 7 years:
---
Hipster missions, heists, freemode missions, then some grinds through biker club, vehicle cargo, plane cargo, ceo work, arena war, nightclubs.  Then we got the doomsday and diamond casino heists lately, 7 years - pretty good content, but not leaps and bounds ahead of 76.  76 got nuclear winter, wild Appalachia, limited time vault raids, and wastelanders in 1+3/4 years.  
---
GTA V does have limited time sales of unique items to encourage people to cash on shark bucks.  Further, they prey on new players with their horribly balanced unavoidable PVP.  All the old heads blow up the new players so they can't grind money until they either quit or buy shark bucks, this is intentional by Rockstar.  Solution is to buy the flying rocket car and the attack choppers, which is far out of reach for the average player grinding getting blown up over and over.  Thankfully it is easy to hack the game also, like dupers, cheaters kinda salvage the mode.  
---
Bethesda does give a couple thousand atoms free to each account through non repeatable challenges still, and possibly 1500 per season.  They gave too many before.  That is plenty of atoms to buy all the slightly beneficial items, collectron, fridge, some scrap/repair kits if you want.. the rest are purely cosmetic and optional.  
---
Not saying 76 is much better than GTA, but they are pretty similar games and Bethesda obviously considered GTA's legendary, predatory monetization.
---
Lovely idea for all of us hoarders out there!
---
I always enjoy those early brawls when tons of people spawn at the same point lol. It also makes me wish for a "specific weapon type only" Nuclear Winter event with proper rewards. Melee only or explosive weapons only would be great.
---
I'm a woman that absolutely would never use my mic while playing overwatch. I love that game and am pretty good at it, can flex pretty well, but the toxicity over there... Instant turn off. I want to WANT to play that game, but it always happens right in the beginning. Someone is instantly calling someone names and cussing them out or being bossy. Playing OW just pisses me off. 
---
at least in FO I've yet to hear anyone be nasty to a woman using a mic.
---
IF you move past him lol
---
Thanks, I just got one
---
Good! I got one and I haven‚Äôt used it yet
---
Or corrupt their inventory, btw we‚Äôre gonna get lots of downvotes
---
Sorry I‚Äôm on PS4 and I probably wouldn‚Äôt trade it
---
So they can get new items from their duper friends and continue like nothing (almost) happened? Just permanently ban them. And put a hardware id ban on them too.
---
This is beyond incorrect. The super duper perk isn't working properly when you try to craft secret service armor - simple as that.
---
Thanks! I got one a day ago and I haven‚Äôt used it yet
---
Hey man, same. I bought on release and like went back to f4 after a few days.
---
Now i came back to Wasteland. And its like much much better games, can't say from veteran perspective but for a new player its a great experience. Looking at roadmap, BoS quests, more dungeons for PvE , slow removal of forced PvP aspects, more teamwork focused gameplay and "one wasteland" will only make this experience greater.
---
Never had so much fun in un-modded ( Bethesda ) game, community is great too. I received a lot of help, got taught how to behave in certain events. And now its me who helps the the others.
---
Grind doesn't worry me, because i play with my own set of goals. But I do agree we need better pve end-game content. Too bad i wasnt playing around that vault 94? ,i heard it was fun. And scrips, gold bullions, tadpole scout thingies? Score? It gets confusing a bit, like too many of it. Kinda wish new end-game content re-used those previous "end-game" content resources more.
---
Only thing that annoys me is sometimes enemies don't give challenge ,especially in the events. When someone 1shots everything and you don't get loot.
---
Yea I use it too, it‚Äôs the best melee skin in game, the shark is hilarious when you hit stuff with it.
---
Or join the game and purposely LET another player kill you, doing this enough may desensitize you from the anxiety.
---
Join and play like your mission is to die at the hands of another player.  Maybe let them work for it a little, put up a bit of a fight, move about and spray that ammo for extra combat practice.
---
Exposure therapy
---
Definitely
---
:)
---
where exactly in this (not official, by the way) video did it say Roger would have been willing to use nuclear weapons to eleminate his enemies? Roger was so disgusted at the idea to the point that when we last hear of him in 76, he is asking the Appalachian chapter to not use them against the scorchbeasts.
---
bringing the BoS back to their ideals pre-Lyons doesn't mean he's the second coming of Roger Maxson, and even then Arthur kept some of the things Lyons was doing. like the giant robot that threw nukes.
---
Yes, this is annoying sometime
---
Makes me think of that Shape of Water scene
---
I was afraid to post such a similar post. While in the game I thought...will I sound like one of those ungreatful weebs? That I saw this top post and I am glad I am not the only one.
---
Same here, big lag when I first open, fine on all catagories but clothing. Real endgame is dressup.
---
I'll be honest I'm at the end of my tether with Bethesda.
---
The Legendary Run is another grind on top of an already SLOW and BORING grindfest endgame. The caps on EVERYTHING is ridiculous.
---
I'm done, I cannot justify playing anymore. Grind to get the rewards? To what end? More camp junk on a budget that isn't increasing?
---
I've finished the game. So have most of us. It's time to move on. and Unfortunately that also means  moving on from Bethesda titles as they will continue this downward spiral of mediocrity.
---
My wife and I play nearly every day.  But we‚Äôre on XB1.  Have fun!
---
Wander about and find quests. 
---
Al's tattoo parlour gives you a good one
---
Excpet for when your loading into a friends world. The game can look at your friends world and see if your soace is occupied and ask you whether you want to go there if that is possible though i dont know since i never made a game or anything like that before
---
Yup!
---
Exactly
---
Naw just ban em
---
they dont ban people nearly enough in this game...
---
If you use power user perk , that 1000 shot per core fyi
---
You can only find a plan if you havent used it ever so you can find infinite if any plan as long as you havent ever used it to learn how to make the item
---
Here is the build I use.  If you just swap out rifleman for commando.  Commando does more DPS than rifleman.

If the crapwater is coming from your sink you might have mixed up your plumbing.
---
Check lucky hole mine for moth man
---
It‚Äôd be nice if that was like a legendary perk and not a team buff. Team buff seems overpowered
---
I just don‚Äôt see how they‚Äôd manage that without fucking it up. ‚ÄúSo uh, we accidentally took everything away from some level 20, but uhhhHhhH we can‚Äôt return items so‚Äù
---
Not really. If you die before they finish you off they wont get the satisfaction of taunting you or getting the final blow. Also whats the point of living if your teamates just wont revive you?
---
Thank you, looks doable - just gotta level to switch from 15 strength to 15 perception. I assume you use a full unyielding set as well?
---
Build a quick camp up to it
---
Todd put the gun down I'm playing, I'm playing!
---
Why does every game I play have people who act like there are guns to their heads? Know what I do when I feel burnt out? I do this magical thing called not playing it.
---
The score system wasn‚Äôt meant for players like you and it okay..  just ignore it And do whatever you enjoy doing before they added it
---
The best thing they can do is permanently fix the exploit but at this point I don‚Äôt believe they can because it‚Äôs a flaw in the games engine which is just a polished version of fo4 which by the way has the same dupe exploits. I wish it could be done that way the team could focus on fixing other bugs in the game instead of wasting resources on chasing down the dupe exploits that seem to come out every month or so .
---
The fact that the drug that makes you smarter is called mentats tells me Dune is a thing in the Fallout universe. A collectron with a dune theme would be absolutely perfect. Blue lights for eyes, maybe painted like it's wearing a still suit. It collects spices, water, and drugs.
---
I like to believe that they do speak - and they thank you for rescuing them...
---
However, they are all empaths (like Diana Troi from Star Trek TNG) and have not mastered the English language. So they just do it telepathically.
---
You don‚Äôt understand lol start a new character just to lvl it up , once you hit lvl10 or something delete it and repeat
---
You are correct.  That is the hard part.  The good news is with SS armor coming out most of the prices of armor have fallen so you can put together a set while you are trying to craft a SS set.
---
Weird capitalization, but okay.
---
Sounds good but knowing Bethesda they'll implement a +5 for each bond and then eventually increase it to +10 and after everyone has screamed and bitched for 8 months they'll finally make it appealing to use.
---
I‚Äôm a woman player on PS4. But honestly I am betting there is a decent community of woman players on this game. Bethesda games in general tend to be popular with woman gamers.

He spawned in already dead for me and Duchess got *VERY* angry at me.

She gets mad at you but says that you did your best

I've heard that relogging will sometimes work with this problem (but not always). So give this a try and see if it helps with your issue.
---
On a side note: Whatever you do, do not place a foundation connected to stairs connecting to another foundation. You will not be able to remove any of those three pieces if you do unless you restart your CAMP.
---
When ppl talking about few bugs they meaning godmode, glitches and dupes, problems with battle pass, not working properly quests and other annoying minor problems not being fixed for several patches? Asking for a friend.
---
Yo returnee guys don't ignore problems we have there. We love the game much more than you do thats why we pointing at this problems, we want them to be fixed. Hell, we play this game everyday after all.
---
Much love, constant player base.
---
What lvl is your main?
---
People always bitch that game studios never do anything different, then when they do all they do is bitch that it's different.
---
Sorry to be that guy but i got to log off for a bit and take care of some stuff, feel free to add me and I'll mod your gun when I'm back on. ( if you still need it)
---
Ik! I instantly bursted out laughing
---
I find the fallout 76 community isn‚Äôt quite as bad about this. Granted I usually am not talking in public and these days you rarely find anyone talking in public chat on 76 but the only time I really found a lot of cringe was the first day of beta from one guy who was obviously wanting to be center of attention.
---
I‚Äôm telling mom you said shut up
---
Drop :)
---
Yeah, I have a trash set right now (mainly 1 stars). Debating on wiether ti buy a decent set or just slowly replace the peices with SS armor.
---
I like new things, im excited about skyrim on the ps5 /s

I was offline and hadn't logged in when they reset, and it got me this time. I had all of them auto-completed except two one of them wasn't fully completed.

"Kill 20 creatures was at 15/20" when I logged in, and the 
---
"Complete an event with another person" was still open.
---
I had a rank that didn't claim from the night before, if that had anything to do with it.

&gt; considered relevant among their peers

So step one, is don't give a shit what other people think about you? Well shitttt I got that one down.

There is/was a lumberjack outfit in the Atom shop that had a light grey knit cap.  It matches the insurgent outfit perfectly.

Gosh dang it that original theme gave me goosebumps.

I‚Äôve been thinking a about that as I only have one character and have been thinking I will need a second to get all the Xbox achievements.  Sorry I‚Äôm an achievement junkie
---
He couldn't stand you're majesticness
---
I have the opposite problem. My husband has absolutely no interest in gaming. The few times I tried to get him interested he gives up a minute into it and growls, ‚Äúthis is stupid, I can‚Äôt get used to these controls‚Äù. He can‚Äôt be bothered to get used to the controls of modern games (he will only play games from our youth where it was one button and a joystick and nostalgia gives him enough interest. Yeah we‚Äôre old). He tolerates how much I game though amazingly for some one who has little interest in it himself.
---
I went back to my food build. To check on how much carry weight it has. Base numbers are 285 (no perk card, gear).  My daily regular gear is 505 with high health (high capacity backpack, deep pockets, full set of 3 star unyielding with weight reduction of weapons, ammo, food and junk). All of the perk cards and no food/drugs bonus. When I unequipped every thing. My inventory weight was 1803.
---
One time i went underwater and some guy was already there but he didnt run so i swam up to him and he did the thumbs up emote and i shot him in the head with my crossbow since you can shoot them underwater and his dead body slowly drifted up as his corpse still did the thumbs up.
---
I love my crochet mallet sledge hammer
---
My friend did, so I made sure not to. I convinced them to spare him but he hasn't shown up again and I finished the Wastelanders questline. Kind of a let down.
---
The rewards aren't really worth grinding for. If your want *all* of them for free, yes you need to do all of the dailies. There is an option to buy levels using atoms (this is the idea behind the design) but, again, it's mostly just cosmetic stuff. Play the game however you want, this new update just gives people something to do.
---
Sure bro no rush, i added you üëç
---
Or Carni-vile?
---
Yeah it was sadly
---
Yes you can convert arrows and crossbow bolts.
---
But if I had more fun and felt like my the Journey was better I say that option is best for me. I DO think there should be servers on Rust where there isn‚Äôt wipes though.
---
Thanks. Sadly I've reloaded a few times with no luck.  
---
And thanks again for the warning because I thought about trying just that. 
---
I guess its not the end of the world if I have to restart it but man, I spend a ton of time getting the building positions just right.
---
Sweet
---
Where did you find this hilarious copy pasta?
---
Don't share Sun kissed and do events wearing your solar armour, makes bloodied builds really quite angry :-)
---
Dump your notes and holotapes that aren't important.
---
You THINK its the best
---
It's a nice community with a handful of toxic players. Glad to have another wanderer in Appalachia take you time with the story and enjoy the experience.
---
The rewards from the Crane quest are fixed rewards and will scale with your current level.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elusive_Crane
---
If you would rather have any of them at their maximum level I would table finishing the quest, or at least redeeming the token, until you reach level 50.
---
Well with +15 to each stat the other bonuses you get really don't make a big deal so personally I would not sweat it and just work on SS.
---
Now if you happen to see a nice piece cheap in a vendor then yeah no sense in not getting it but I would not make it a focus.
---
Damn, you must be doing it wrong. The plasma is so op. One shots everything. Ammo is efficient. I have every heavy weapon bloodied and nothing compared to the plasma.
---
Bloodied one I bugged and way better
---
They will probably release half the stuff in the legendary run later this year through the atom shop. Or at least some variation of it. 
---
No doubt that fireplace will be sold in the atom shop but probably with a palette swap.  Don't sweat it buddy.
---
I actually think that Starfield is an opportunity to build that engine.
---
Definitely, currently working on a new sniper who's in his 20's and goddam is it a different beast than my 200's heavy gunner.
---
It also helps renew my hatred for scorchbeasts.
---
I also want you to do this
---
Wow.  That is dedication.  I thought the only way to achieve that this early was to utilize exploits like the God-mode one.  Impressive.
---
I'd be okay with the scrip cap being at 150 or 200 a day but switching to a note style system.
---
Let me scrap everything today and get an I.O.U from the purveyor or a running tally.
---
Sometimes I just stop playing because of the buildup.
---
As for treasury notes I love having a few days worth because some days I only have time to hop on shortly and don't want to miss my daily gold.
---
I disagree. I feel like the only people who warrant a ban are the predatory players who are duping en masse and charging stupid IRL money for bundles of God roll weapons. They're the problem. Not a group of friends trading amongst themselves.
---
rAiDeRs ArE bAAaAd
---
Also those weird spots where everyone looks shadowy and greasy. Which is different than the places that make every texture solid black. Some lighting in this game is amazing. Some is literally the worst.
---
Wow.  Well, there it is.
---
What's broken about gunsmith and white knight ? They don't make equipment last longer?
---
Also you can go to bed and wake up to all your shit being raided lmao.
---
Yea have someone craft for you
---
They have let it go too long, too many dupe now because they see no repercussions.
---
They would have to ban a big percentage of their players.
---
It'll actually convert just about every ammo in game. It's nice to get something from all the 40mm grenades we get.
---
ask someone else to make you some nice hot smoes
---
What‚Äôs wrong with white knight?
---
Thanks, but I've seen better!
---
You're probably right!
---
Hmmm ü§î I've never had more than one, and read somewhere you can't get more than one. The exception is the Plague Walker mutation. Hmmm.
---
Yes, equipped or not stuff breaks at the same rate.
---
Yes! Ugh I didn‚Äôt mean to but apparently one little nudge killed him.
---
Maybe it's a high risk high reward situation? I think that would be good.
---
31 at the moment, missed two days at the start of the season but have been on everyday since.
---
Well shit...
---
I found one!
---
High risk high reward.
---
161ish
---
I agree with you. Characters should had advantages and flaws in RP.
---
But, in a way, bloodied allows you to play your character more. It allows you to choose the dialogue your character would choose, despite skill requirements.
---
The A.T.H.E.N.A mission is a good example. Why would I need Luck 15 to say something I figured out irl? Lucky for me, I had max Luck (I'm playing a Luck based character). But, still, I could see why stuff like that would be annoying.
---
Simple options locked between skill checks is just as annoying as your character saying something wildly different than the option in Voice Protag games.
---
How about they remove a major reason for duping... and actually fix legacy effects?
---
I do too. Out of all the grindy bullshit they've added this is by far my favorite. Good rewards and steady progression. I've actually been enjoying doing it.
---
Armour breaks just as fast equipped or not, have tested quite thoroughly
---
Thank you so much!  You've made my weekend!
---
During one of the PTS runs, yep.  
---
I suppose it's my own fault for hitting him with a .50 cal, but still!
---
High risk high reward? Maybe that's what balances it.
---
Yes I did
---
I know ü§£
---
Do that to people who duped and (try) to sell hundreds of mounted heads. I wish I could have their mounted head at my camp.
---
Is it possible? Yes. 
---
Will require more grinding though. What tier are you?
---
Hi Ladydevann! I'm still having issues and would be happy to help out. Message me on Reddit if you can.
---
I have literally never used that terminal, but it is in my camp still. What does it even do exactly? Just shows me the available dailies? Is it different from the pipboy menu?
---
No thanks.
---
What you're suggesting would be better served having a buff slot that you simply choose it.
---
applying a buff every 1 hour is tedious
---
I agree. Since other team bonus increases only one special stat this should increase 5lb too. 5lb is 1 strength. But it is not affected by mutation strength lost.
---
Can someone post the calendar link for upcoming xp n score dates please?
---
Happy to help! I remember that feeling, ran a free equipment event for new players a long time ago... some guy dropped by, gave me a TON of stuff I didn‚Äôt have (and didn‚Äôt realize was in the game with some). I‚Äôve tried to do the same now that I‚Äôm in a place to do it.
---
It's inside whitesprings if you want to hear it.
---
Exactly my point üëçüëç
---
Have fixed my Gauss shotgun daily since the last patch.
---
Didn't have to do it once for weeks before
---
Oh really? I'll have to head there
---
Mine didnt appreciate getting his teeth smashed in by a blunderbust
---
How are they ruining anyone elses chance at getting there?
---
This the way!
---
Not gonna lie, I forgot about this games existence lol
---
If you've got the goat legs perk and one piece of fall damage armor, you're good. I've seen people saying that those don't stack, but I've used them together and survived the fall. And I think you're right about timing your descent, if you just fall for a while with enough AP and you start a long burst, you can live without the fall damage armor.
---
I drop off stuff for beanies whene'er I can as well.  I remember my first day.  That was a huge deal.
---
This should have been the exploration team
---
A few stimpack and some ammo, you feel like a good god hah.
---
Thought I was doing what she wanted me to do :/
---
TL;DR
---
Don't lie.
---
Saved you a bunch of words =)
---
even if they where grinding XP 24 7 with max base INT + egghead + herd mentality + building public team + full set of unyielding + 1 of each stack-able XP boost (Tasty Squirrel Stew for life!) it would be a bit longer before anyone gains it legit. if my math is correct. though, that's gonna change once people can spend atoms for a boost in spaces (maybe)
---
Best xp I have going for myself is in a group of 2-3 people and do the vein glitch in glassed cavern with all the boosts to XP u can get ... I was leveling about 10 levels an hour up to about level 75
---
You can accept those 3 dailies and get a map marker for the Purveyor and the tourist with a camera using it. That's literally it lol. I mean it was great for me for finding the camera but it could be so much more.
---
So the point is saving time 
---
Going from lvl4 to lvl5 would take you 5-10min 
---
Going from lvl161 to lvl162 would take you 30? Maybe 60min?
---
I know people that make new characters each day get to lvl4 collect the 250 score , delete then go finish up the rest on there main
---
It's a mod that takes the place of other mods on the SS Armor. You won't be able to have Deep Pockets on your SS chest piece, instead you mod it for the jet pack.
---
I have a ghoul slayers 40% swing speed bat. I put barbed wire and for color as close as I could and named it Lucille.
---
Oh I see, so the daily and weeklies are across the board? So you could just level up on a different character, collect the score and it‚Äôd count towards your whole account?
---
I have to disagree, there are no limited time exclusive rewards unless you talk about event stuff like halloween or Valentine wich returns every year. 
---
Lets not kid ourselfs, the only real update worth mentioning was maybe wastelanders..
---
GTA5 have been out for 7 years or so and the only real complains are from those that want everything in 1 day thats been released in the span of 7 years. 
---
Not to mention you can pick up GTA5 for like 5-10 bucks pretty often wich included online and the single player..
---
Bethesda got a lot to learn from rockstar.
---
Not saying they are the best company  but in comparison its miles ahead of Bugthesda.
---
Sweet idea. Thank you
---
Between the lackluster rewards and the fact that nothing new was added I just log in to buy gold from Smiley and check the atom shop on Tuesday.
---
With carnivore on a team Tasty squirrel stew +25% experience for 1 hour
---
yeah.. about that food business..
---
dont quit your day job...
---
i'm pretty sure this is an outfit reward for the Collosus update, not 100% sure
---
The ones that usually cost 10000+ from the robot vendors? Isn't 5000 caps already reasonable? They cost like 8000 something caps even with high charisma and grape mentats and unless I'm mistaken cannot drop as loot.
---
Those plans cost 11,000 from a vendor so I doubted.
---
Yea the score is account wide.. 
---
You can only claim on 1 character tho
---
Oh, apologies, I read on the wiki they go for 5,000
---
I also got it recently and have been enjoying it a lot. My only fear is if there's enough end game
---
Unless it is possible to buy the ranks with atoms already (don't remember when it is enabled) then i'm calling BS. Not legit. You need \~220k score to reach rank 100. That would mean that with int 40 and rest bonus with inspirational perk you would have to farm roughly 55000 high level super mutants for the 22 million xp needed. If you see someone with rank 100 stuff on, report them. The numbers are from farming xp only, if you did all challenges you would need slightly lower amount of xp. But impossible anyways.
---
Ah, well that's pretty useless yeah. Camera was terribly difficult to find when that was new, so good that others can get it easier now.
---
it would be nice if food put in a fridge/cooler spoiled -90% slower, but i would disagree about them lasting forever (unless its canned)
---
That‚Äôs mint, thanks for taking the time to explain it. So I could get the SCORE, then go back to my main to claim the rewards? That‚Äôs great news and solves my issue. Thanks friend
---
Beautiful story thank you for sharing
---
There are lots of items I'd like to display that are half sunk into the display case like this, sadly. Or they don't even show up, like a Commendation.
---
This is a huge problem for me as well. I don't get to play as much as some of my friends. I've been grinding rep as much as I can an still only Neighborly.
---
Np glad to help
---
All I said was that it made it easier to get the 5 dailies challenge done. I can look at two numbers and see one is larger than the other.
---
I‚Äôm lvl 234 and I‚Äôve grinded  for my lvl. No fake stuff here.  Been doing it for over a year. I‚Äôm sure those who are able to play (especially thru this coronavirus deal) can legitimately lvl up pretty quick.
---
5,000 seems like a steal. I never saw them in a player vendor and eventually just bought the plan when I was close to max caps.
---
Deconstruct them.
---
You can buy plans for them at the enclave bunker or the Brotherhood vendor in Whitesping Resort.
---
Both also have Gauss rifle mods for purchase as well I believe.
---
There's no need to do any story quests with an alt, you just use them as throwaway chars or as a mule for excess gear. Time investment can be kept to a minimum, too: just skip through the intro and customization process and leave the vault, pick up weapons and throw down your camp next to an easily takeable workshop (like Billings Homestead or Hemlock with their pitiable 4 ghouls), and log out.
---
Now, whenever you need a level up, just switch to that char and take the workshop. Done.
---
And the benefit, you ask? Your main char is free to play as much as you like, without worrying about saving that level-up.
---
And who knows, you might even get drawn into roleplaying that alt as Old Billings, having to defend the farm against those dang trespassers every time he wakes up from his slumber,  or whatever. Your game, your story.
---
Lucille deserves two asses 
---
(assassin joke fml)
---
Why are people downvoting a question? lol
---
They are broken, and not just for me, others have confirmed :-)
---
Fair enough, I suppose. Guess I'll just keep saving my cappys
---
Want me to aplaud you or what?
---
I still can‚Äôt find it in my camp? Do you have to buy the bundle cause I can‚Äôt find it anywhere/:
---
from what i have tested, no. but Herd Mentality does trigger, and you can also throw in one more INT for choosing the building team
---
I think they mean the legendary journey?
---
Wait
---
Just farmed and crafted 45 of them Friday. Took 2 hours tops and a few server hops. Since they last 90 minutes, as opposed to BSBB's 30 minutes, it's worth the farm.
---
or at least a plan to make some others
---
Great, I'll take 2.
---
HAAAAAAAAAZMAAAAAAT!
---
Heck ya, I've killed at least a few hundo.  Well on my way.
---
Come by later tonight, 7:00 pm est and I can help you. Just need to grind some ingredients
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that I just bought a Slocum Joe Vending Station skin?? 500 and it didn‚Äôt say skin /: can‚Äôt find it anywhere in my camp
---
EDIT: yup just a skin
---
Check player vendors the ones that have opened a lot of boxes at Xmas time have the plans for sale
---
Yep
---
5k is cheap for those plans
---
You're supposed to boil the water...
---
[You can do it with timing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/gozl55/psa_get_yourself_a_jetpack/) But, 2 pieces of fall damage reduction armor will assure your survival. I've managed to live after falling with just 1 piece and 2 points of the Goat Legs perk card also.
---
Well bois we did it. Duping is no more
---
Maybe if they have a gambling addiction and haven‚Äôt slept and have been slamming meth since the season started, they‚Äôre at level 100.
---
Don‚Äôt confuse them with the Duper‚Äôs guys be like ‚Äòbitch I got 100 Mofoing BE‚Äôs I don‚Äôt need your stims‚Äô
---
Honestly, just some non-hostile cultists would be a good start. We also could use lucky hole instead so new players don‚Äôt have to deal with a nuke zone.
---
So... there need to be repercussions. They have waved the ban stick before and have shown they are willing to piss off a lot of people with the TSE nerf. So there is nothing stopping them from going beserk on these assholes.
---
Well it works on a public server in a solo team so i don't see why not.
---
Easy to try. kill something. note xp gain. put on card. kill same thing. note xp gain.
---
Easy enough to test. Find two identical, same levels mobs with same name and kill them with and without it.
---
It's in the mall area where the shops are, you'll hear the music change.
---
Team up and have someone build it for you, can still move it around etc
---
So does Lone Wanderer work on a solo team do you know?
---
Great thanks!
---
yeah well none of my buddies play, so thats why im reaching out here lol
---
Kind of funny to see someone with Raider flair trying to call out someone for abusing a system lol.
---
Cool, thank you for the help :)
---
someone hit 100 by grinding xp for 81 hours in 4 days. Post removed as it was rightfully called out as being unhealthy. 
---
then they posted again with proof. They were hitting westek mostly with a silly amount of xp buffs and were getting 500xp per supermutant. that adds up
---
Post asking for it, someone will do it for you I guarantee, just suggesting something that's quicker for you :-)
---
It's going from awful mess to playable farming simulator. I'm also a day 1 player but I don't understand how you guys completely ignore any negative aspects of the game and pretend that releasing a 60 dollar game that took 2 years to patch to normal status should be applauded.
---
I wish Bethesda actually cared about NW to add a commie Wacker only ltm. The final circle would be a battle for the ages.
---
I'm nearly rank 30, I could get higher but NW is dead in my time zone so it's impossible to get those challenges, thanks for replying!
---
I'm just saying that to me it doesn't seem like proof you did the event a lot when some people get it first and second time. I'm not saying your didn't so the event alot, I'm just saying the suit just shows the RNG finally favored you. I get the suit second time but still after I don't know how many times of doing ridding shotgun I still haven't gotten any themed rewards.
---
We should be able to capitalize somehow on whatever preservation has happened in the coolers we find in the world, some of that food we find has to be decades old when we find it and consume it. 
---
How many Atom points to get one of those coolers??
---
Never mind found it on the Vendor category. Swipe all the way to the right, just a skin
---
I find this "feature" is most prominent during highly populated events like  SBQ fights and Radiation Rumble. Often Ill have to spam the Right D-Pad to get it working but in the process, consume a multiple stims. Most of my deaths come from this "feature": stimpack hotkey not registering, especially on my bloodied build.
---
Thats what this post is for... lol
---
not sure, i've not used lone wanderer in some time.
---
Vampires broadsider with faster movement speed while aiming is my personal favorite I got from mumbles recently
---
I wish people were doing encryptid while i was on, might finally get my fixer plan
---
Sorry, thought you were just asking for help getting hardened mass, for building rad shower
---
Beat me to it!
---
I wish I played from launch, I don‚Äôt know how bad it was, Haters aside. I joined a few months before Wastelanders so got to enjoy the initial conception and thought it was so clever and beautiful. The main quest is just amazingly written. Feeling so lonely in a recently vacated land is awesome! The only human contact being the other vault dwellers. I could go on forever as to why it‚Äôs better than other Fallouts too. It just is. Love It!
---
Yep. Bought a recall card last night, activated it, waited for almost the whole duration for people to turn up. Which they didnt. So tried doing it myself and failing. Wont be doing that again. Pointless if nobody else will turn up to it.
---
She wanted a toy alien to remember the cat with, by leaving it outside in the elements on the grave. If I hadn't taken it she never would have traded me the toy rocket and actually kept the alien. Poor kid, but her actions and words don't match.
---
It's completely pointless but that always boggled my mind a little.
---
100 increased carryweight is a bit much dont you think? Maybe 15 o 20 per bond would be more balanced
---
But awesome idea! Never seen or thought something like this.
---
THATS WHY HANDMADES WAY SO MUCH I GET IT NOW!!
---
I can get behind 15 or 20, but thanks!
---
Wait, holdup, what?!
---
I'm usually not one to skin my guns, but somehow I wound up with the skin for the gauss shotgun. No picture at the moment, but it actually looks pretty good. [Here's a picture of it from the WIKI.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/4/43/FO76_NW_Camo_Gauss_Shotgun_Skin.png/revision/latest?cb=20200522143748)
---
I thought it was just me. Id hit my stim amd nothing happens....than spam it and eventually ill just use 10 at once....so annoying to die like that
---
Any time!
---
How much bloody content do people want?
---
You have 2 whopping main quest lines.
---
Countless side quests and dailies
---
Build a base
---
All those events
---
Scavenging
---
Like. For reals. Surely, it doesn't matter what they add, people are always going to say "yeah, there isn't enough content for me".  You have a shit ton of content to explore...fucking do it.
---
Well damn. Knew about adrenaline but not gunsmith.  Guess I get to play around with some more points.
---
when i was somewhere level 15-20, i walked from my CAMP under the new river bridge, almost straight east to harpers ferry.  only died twice, at beckwith's farm, and sunday brothers cabin. took me like 2 hours total.
---
i miss the "me against the world" feeling, and that even though i knew i was alone, i felt i was chasing survivors of appalachia, but always just like 3 steps behind them.
---
Thank you
---
They are different.
---
during the first playthrough with my mainchar crane was already dead when i entered the chamber... and duchess totally mad at me.....
---
Of course you‚Äôre welcome I spent a bit of time testing this.
---
Oh ok. My bad.  Early people had a opening on the gold plans because they had price wrong so that not their fault for taking advantage of that.
---
I'm at rank 43, 300 points from 44. I have been grinding to much ü§£ I started at around lvl 150 and I'm at 252 now üòÖ I'll try to get as far as possible, but I'll buy the last ranks when the time is almost over i have around 8000 atoms stored.
---
And haven't done any nw challenges it's just faster to grind the repeatable üëç
---
There is so much good game here.  But people only focus on the bad.  Yea some things are annoying but overall I love this game.  There are a lot of games I'd love to be able to wipe my memory and play it for the first time again
---
I would get weird with it. Try adding walls. Your one section is more than halfway past the boundary so you likely won‚Äôt be able to build walls there, but try it on other sections. Try selecting a piece of foundation, replace it with a different type (such as the wooden foundation) then try to delete. You could also try stacking foundations then delete them. Here‚Äôs a video. 
---
https://youtu.be/CXA_djm7v8k
---
Good luck.
---
Got a fixer plan for you if your are xb1
---
For me I find they snap when placed only on outside ground, so I do that  then I blueprint them, next change the indoor floors to farmable tiles/foundations, now place the blueprints snapped together vendors, then replace the foundations/tiles back to your desired look.
---
A good way of doing it would allow us to store food that then lasts forever. 
---
However once it's condition deteriorates completely. Once removed it must be consumed with 1 minute or it rots. 
---
Allows for storage but not bulk distribution. Basically an infinite shelf life but once opened rots fast.
---
tasty squirrel stew gives 25 bonus exp with strange in numbers and carnivore. Boiled scorchbeast brains give + 7.5 int .
---
I WAS LIKE WHAT! 
---
And then I couldn‚Äôt load before it happened. 
---
In Appalachia we live with our mistakes
---
War never changes
---
I think the $13 a month plus,  is worth more to bethesda.
---
Not just from your stash but also your personal inventory . Once you ditch the notes and holos you'll be surprised at how responsive the trade and stash windows get.
---
ty for your input
---
What makes you say that.
---
BETHESDA, whats best in life?
---
to crush our customers with RNG, see them driven into madness because of bugs, and hear their timegating lamentations...
---
Wait. You can't use any skins on the fixer??
---
As a higher level player i always play the instruments, i dont kill any of the ghouls unless help is needed and i wont even tag the nightstalker, i dont really need another poopy legendary sitting in my inventory anyway...the only problem thonis that the lowbies who are are there arent usually able to kill the ghouls fast enough so you get rushed but since the public teams became a thing theres usually a shit ton of dudes there now. Im happy enough to just chill and get my well tuned, a couple notes and free bbbeeeerrrrrr
---
It's possible if they complete every challenge so far and hit all the good xp farming locations hopping servers 15 hours per day every day.
---
but its summer time and I have better things to do.
---
That‚Äôs dope
---
What they'll do now is release all the stuff people have wanted for ages so that it will cause a dilemma -  do I buy this skin I've waited a year for and then have no atoms left to contribute towards completing the legendary run, or do I keep my atoms to progress through the legendary run.
---
This will force more people to end up buying atoms.
---
Mmmmmmm...............butts
---
5mm is pretty abundant and cheap to craft. Also you don't need 1st to transfer, plenty of people would be willing to help you move some stuff. Heck plenty of people would be happy to help you finish the vault raid even
---
I'm sorry you used your resources for nothing though
---
I‚Äôm rank 4. I just started playing 2 days ago so I know I won‚Äôt finish it. I‚Äôm really enjoying the game though üôå
---
Raider Punk will sometimes send you to go deal with a Mothman, which at 150 is the only way I‚Äôve ever fought one.
---
whoa, this calculator is awesome! i haven't seen it before
---
The game's been out for years, everyone has already beat it and the newest content as well.
---
Wow these are really good. Especially like the sheepsquatch one, debating using that as a phone wallpaper!
---
I let them kill him
---
24 im not doing every challenge
---
Found it. Thank you. Was just being blind...
---
I remember playing this game for the first time on Christmas day 2018 and hearing this, it's enough to make me shed a tear
---
I have 2 spare smores plans, what's your GT? I'll drop you one. üëç
---
Neither upvote nor downvote
---
I may have the recipe plan, think I sell them for 399 caps. Hit me up if you still need it.
---
to rank up, you collect S.C.O.R.E. you get it by completing the daily and weekly challenges that are displayed under "Challenges" on the Map screen
---
Well, the T65 PA is bugged and one can build the cosmo jetpack on it, even if it is not reached...
---
The Free Staters might have been right that the end was near, but they were also a crazy militia movement. 
---
And no, no it doesn't make sense in 2020.
---
They're 'daily' until you complete them and revisit that area. I usually try to make sure that all three of the Camden park quests are active before I even go over there to do them. But, I won't get one of those quests until I visit the Ash Heap. I went to the Purveyor yesterday, and got the popup for Lucky Mucker.  
---
You have to visit the region where the quests are to get them to show up. 
---
Still not exactly sure what's going on with the Ally quests, I don't get one every day from Settler Wanderer.
---
Free States all the way. Wish they had more of a presence in the game.
---
No, they haven't.
---
I instantly decided the first sheepsquatch thorn-o-rama was my favourite. And that assertion changed with every photo along the way. 
---
I believe that's the sign of a quality collection and a knack for this. Thanks for sharing, I enjoyed those immensely. 
---
(also for what it's worth, the understated feeding the radstag ended up being my favourite, with the flaming SB a close joint second alongside the blurred mirelurk queen/SS fight).
---
I can see that this can be a problem. If someone leaves while your near max you will become over encumbered forcing you to drop stuff to fast travel.
---
This is why the number one rule in sharing perks is that. NEVER share weight affecting perks.
---
That is literally it. Look at the daily and weekly challenges, do what they want you to do to get the score points and rank up! Only one that is repeatable is the 10000xp one. You get 100 score per 10000xp. Good luck.
---
Very handy! Thanks for sharing.
---
There isn‚Äôt a perk card I am aware of that will do that. Most of them only increase reload of the current weapon, Even the speed demon serum.
---
Just playing devils advocate here bbbuuuttttt....from a marketting standpoint fomo is actually pretty genius....the whole fomo thing doesnt really bother me, if im out doing something i could give 2 shits if im missing out on some bullion or scrip or w/e. Theyre making their nut off of people who just cant resist the urge. The real problem is that theyre not making or atleast it doesnt seem like bethesda is really interested in making any legit end game content BECAUSE THEYRE SO FOCUSED on this fomo style of content additions. Id love to see an actual full up expansion and even better a hard rebalancing of the elements currently in the game. But yea...fomo it is i guess : /
---
I'm going to bet the majority has already beaten both storylines and most of the side quests.
---
I've experienced this when placing something that far outside of the build area. Unfortunately it remained there until I moved my whole camp. Relogging never worked for me.
---
Me too man. That first experience was astounding. I miss the tech test :(
---
Wow! I think the mothman one is beautiful! And the scochbeast on the way out of its nest and the wendigo colossus is intimidating. Really good job. I enjoyed this alot!
---
This idea is good and has been suggested many times.
---
Speaking about food I think they should really simplify the ingredients in recipes. Farming and teleporting all over the place just to make a single food doesn't feel fun
---
The daily and weekly score challenges are the only way to advance it, the repeatable gain XP challenge is decent but a long grind
---
I'm going with getting as high as I can on the board, then using the atoms I get from it to hopefully finish the last bit right before the end
---
Since the amount of score to rank up goes up with each level but every level is 150 atoms, buying higher levels is a better value
---
Mmm mmmm canned scorchbeast brains, just like mama used to make. I like the idea.
---
same boat. i've put a bit of "extra" money into this game: 3mo of FO1, used a $20 gift card for atoms, and bought the settlers skin pack (on top of the tricentennial version). i love FO. been playing almost nonstop since launch. i got tired of the grind. got tired of feeling i had to play every day instead of *wanting* to play. i decided to take a break when my last month of first ran out the end of may, and was gonna come back with update 20.
---
i started red dead 2 in the meantime, and when i saw how badly seasons was being handled and how everyone was annoyed, i still stuck with RDR. the change of pace great. i still have the bit of FOMO, but i'm telling myself it's not worth the headache or frustration. i'm enjoying the slower game, exploring the world, missions at my leisure... i'm sure i'll play FO76 again soon, probably move my CAMP and get back into the swing of things when i finish RDR's main missions. idk it's just nice to relax and play for a change.
---
Other players are supposed to make the game fun, that the whole point of an online fallout.
---
I agree with you on the vault thing and we definitely need more PvE experiences. But it's come a long way. It's not a horrible game anymore.
---
Typical - I'm okay with grind as long as I get the rewards I want with the effort I want to give. I'm ok with pvp but only if I dont die a lot. I'm okay with rng but only if I get the items I want by the time I feel I've tried enough
---
Those are some great pics!
---
Update:. I completed the quest!  Thanks for your help all!
---
It takes 2 "accidental" inputs to Contest a workshop. The first to request the contest. The second to confirm you understand the contest and agree to pvp. 
---
Cut them down with no guilt my dude.
---
According to True Achievements, only 20% of registered Xbox One players have started Wastelanders, of which only 10% has completed one of the Wastelanders quests.
---
New players are entering the game all the time.
---
Your experience does not translate to the experience of many.
---
I can agree with that except one point. The buyer from your vendor should see it and buy it at full item health. That penalty should only be on the seller. Otherwise I think it sounds fair.
---
wastelanders is a few months old. While many people have played through all of it, not everyone has.
---
Bethesda *is* working on new content - we've already seen several teasers introduced for the new One wasteland for All update with associated BoS content. They just can't roll this out all at once. If you're tired of playing for now, stop until the next major update. That's certainly my plan once I get tired - though since I can usually only play a few hours a night, that will take a while.
---
So 30 hours of content.  Yup.  Need more.
---
No
---
I‚Äôm getting a contact high just by reading this. You must be on that CHRONIC. Pass to the left son.
---
That's true, Bethesda does have more fomo built into the shop, I wasn't sure GTA brought the same items back yearly.  Only played regularly '13-14 and a little bit now.  
---
Ehh there was a good chunk added with Lying Lowe, Biv, and the scouts, vault 94/survival(rip), project paradise, free range all added before wastelanders.  Lumped into wild wasteland.  Pretty closely comparable to the first two years of GTAO content.
---
My first and biggest complaint coming back to GTAO after 5 years is griefing, as I mentioned but you didn't address.  Getting money and progressing is easy, if you are lucky to find a server where there isn't some ass with an Opressor killing the noobs.  This serves Rockstar well, as people invested in single player come online to get wrecked by the same car over and over, take out their wallet and buy it to compete.  Second complaint is multiple minute loading screens for missions, personally I've never seen longer load times.  
---
I agree a huge mistake of Bethesda's is not making the game single player with a multiplayer option, and they've made many many mistakes in their first online game.  Rockstar was able to fine tune the online mode of GTA4 since 2008 to give us the GTAO we saw in 2013 and today, but look at RDR2O...  
---
I think the design direction of fallout 76 is the worst of any online game, removing content and backtracking their announcements is pathetic.  Shows awful leadership.  But they've replaced Emil Pagliarulo since launch(thank dogs) and hopefully can maintain a good direction for future content.  This "Legendary Run" is garbage time filler but colossal problem is great and BOS news is exciting
---
What rank are you now? I think to be on track for 100 you should be nearing 30
---
Raw ingredients can expire, I think finalized ones should last considerably longer
---
&gt; realistically the only food you can sell are unperishables, but they're worthless stat-wise so why would anyone buy it.
---
The canned meat stew is a good option for selling, 5% XP always sells
---
Play another game, then? If you aren't enjoying this, then play one of the other millions of games out there. 30 hours of content is a lot for a modern game.
---
Where are they all coming from?
---
We're getting Wendigo.  I guess you can expect maybe 2 "end game" things per year.
---
So you want a pat a pat on the back for a killing a low level who wanted to do the daily?
---
I‚Äôve always thought mama dolces should give a camp item to can your food. Maybe with a debuff in some way because it‚Äôs now canned.
---
And with all that considered, you honestly dont even need the extra health....nothing in this game really does all that much damage anyway. If your running around with 100 health/bloodied/junkies u have more than enough health for literally anything. If you wanna go big dick damage you could go even lower and probably still be just fine. Full health builds are good for pvp which noone does sooooo bloodied it is!
---
Don't know why but I was expecting an "and then I went home and played some FO76" at the end of the post.
---
I dunno because players could just trade via vendor between each other for infinite life. 
---
As in "Hey come over and buy all my food then trade it back so I can reset the timer" 
---
It needs a penalty for long term storage.
---
I was thinking of it as a buy and consume to enjoy the buff.
---
I'm like rank 3... maybe. I haven't been doing them. But that's okay if I can keep advancing to get any I'll be happy. Thanks for replying!
---
In a week we can use atoms to level up.  so save them  for the levels.
---
It‚Äôs legendary run under the menu
---
It‚Äôs very Westworld.
---
We had sort of the opposite problem ... last couple times we‚Äôve kicked off the event, somebody has showed up and burned through the ISS extremely quickly ... in a couple of cases the person who paid for the recall card wasn‚Äôt even able to get a hit on it. Even beyond the whole ‚Äúshare legendaries to be polite‚Äù concept, if you didn‚Äôt pay for the event (or run the silo), you don‚Äôt have the right to decide to torch the legendary. It‚Äôs extremely aggravating, and part of the reason we are reluctant to start events on public servers any more - my group has more than enough people to easily tackle these events in a private server. And then that just leaves other people on public servers with no one to come to the events. It‚Äôs bad for everyone.
---
And what I‚Äôm saying is if the level one is not done for your five you are still missing 250 score so if you think you can miss it cause of one extra 250 score you will still lose score for not doing it. Just not as much.
---
Go to the game menu over the map, and select 'THE LEGENDARY RUN'.
---
Game him the same wack I gave 4's father on sight.  Intercranial lead injection.
---
More like a shoulder to cry on. The quest was to claim a workshop, not contest someone else‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt want to kill him I swear!
---
Those crafty bastards.
---
Go away kid....
---
It sounds like you were looking at the Legendary Run, the current season
---
Open your map, then the menu with the atomic shop and you'll see Legendary Run in the list, click on it to get to the gameboard :)
---
Tysm
---
not bad, but gonna be obsolete when people start ignoring food and etc with one wasteland.
---
would rather see more robust display shelves and options before anything else "new" like the ammo converter.  i mean we can put a captured frog into a display case, but have nowhere to go with a giddyup buttercup or a jangles?
---
True. But they could just take out one cranberry relish and use it immediately and leave the rest for later. At least this way the buyer isn‚Äôt punished for some bad apples.
---
It always saddens me when awesome weapons are underappreciated. Nothing about those seem crappy to me, but I like to run all weapons and not just what everyone else considers meta. Just glad they went to someone and not the scrip machine.
---
Dont forget "lovers embrace" gives you bonus co for awhile. As does cranberry juice and cranberry cobbler, you can even make cranberry juice out of diseased cranberries. The food reward from the event "feed the people" gives an xp bonus too.
---
The foods that give xp bonus cant be stacked but it appears lovers embrace does stack with one consumable
---
After reading a few comments it should be called "hoarders" not scavengers.
---
b2525 assaultron head is the one that i remember the most
---
He told you, you weren't
---
True but the last post via search was nearly a year ago. With an influx of newer players and the new seasons being introduced. Maybe it's a good time to remind Bethesda that people like this idea. 
---
They have a least proven that some community ideas get added since then.
---
I swear I read "I started at lunch" and I was like wtf?
---
I was wondering the same thing since I have it on disc for xbox.
---
I recently downloaded it to pc since it is on game pass.
---
I found out I had to make a new character and am not even using my GT but a random ID of numbers and letters for some reason.
---
I almost did lol, I seriously grinded my gears with an _oh wait_
---
Killed him anyway so...
---
Yes he did
---
Only the people who don't like managing their food and thirst will ignore it. As the Well Fed and Well Hydrated perks are good but not necessary. 
---
Maybe if they added something like this which allows you to keep hold of Buffs on the go. People will look into food and drinks more. As the benefits will be much much greater.
---
It‚Äôs dead even during this season? Damn
---
Yeah this right here. I love this game but cannot for the life of me forget the half hourly server disconnects around launch
---
I want me some Canned Cranberry Relish. Tasty tasty
---
But see it gets really challenging when you want to use the excavator to get 4x the ore but loose how much you can carry. Plus I loose DR so it's really a tough choice going into my excavator because I cant just whip it out whenever.
---
Yes I remember a FO4 dupe trading with the dog dropping an item then reloading the save
---
I've had the mistake before. Try to restart the game.
---
Welcome back to Appalachia!
---
That's awesome they let it go! I saw a player with a few display cases showing 8 pies in total. The jealousy was real.
---
Visual glitch. Access atom shop and they should show.
---
Go to your map and see. Had this happen a few times to me. Turned out to just be a visual glitch.
---
I guess you cant read then
---
INT gives an xp boost
---
Which has nothing to do with what I said. So why did you ever bring it up?
---
thank you for the offer, but PS4 here
---
&gt;Does anybody really need +4 INT, considering it doesn't give an XP gain bonus?
---
I'll stop you there, as you are operating on false information in that assertion, and also the detriments of thirst and hunger are being removed sometime in the future, or at least being changed. 
---
I didn't read the rest. If you can't do basic fact checking for a rant dressed up as being informed, then it's not worth bothering. I am as quick as anyone to hold devs responsible for their mishaps, and this game definitely has its fair share of issues, but still. 
---
Pick a side. If you wanna just rant/vent then people will laugh and point or agree and it'll go away, but doing bulletpoints acting like you did some research and largely getting stuff wrong/not checking if it's been touched upon is just even worse for me.  
---
Shrug. Be at peace, mon amis.
---
Um what? INT absolutely gives xp bonus, but unlike events it counts to ALL xp gains making it better then events team in most situations.
---
if i knew when and even if i was going to be able to play today, i'd offer, but it'd be no fun.
---
i'm a bush wookie in flatwoods and a water wookie/bush wookie in morgantown
---
I always wondered why we can't display jangles. He's big enough to fit in the tall, wide ones.
---
Theres a pristine buttercup?? Where?
---
Found it in a metal chest where we turn in documents to the brotherhood
---
Where is it on Steam? I only see the standard atom packs
---
Yea. Stupid part is, I wasn't even trying to put it outside. I built the middle block first then added that one by mistake.
---
I would kill for this.
---
You just found b2525 fixer... Holy shit balls. You jammy bastard.
---
Int does give XP bonus. Is about 2% for each level of int. So +4 is about 8%
---
Builder team is better then events because you get that boost of everything including kills
---
Is it just called pristine giddyup buttercup?
---
True I won't lie this idea is defiantly rough around the edges haha
---
Higher Intelligence does give extra xp, my dude.
---
That would be awesome and only logical, since, why the hell can't you just bottle it?
---
On a side note, if you struggle with curing diseases, you can craft disease cures rather quickly, given you have the right perks (at least green thumb and chemist):
---
1. Equip green thumb
---
2. Go to the wayward and follow the water southwards. Pick up the Bloodleaves and Snaptail reeds
---
3. Now travel to Slocum Joes. There are fire caps scattered all around the hill and train track and make your way to the overseer (you still need to search a little). You should end up with around 10 firecaps.
---
4. Equip Chemist and Super Duper and craft all your disease cures
---
I do this anytime I'm running low on cures, while almost always curing my diseases, this still gives me enough for many hours of play time.
---
according to this video it's roughly 4%  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS09A4gdt10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS09A4gdt10)  and that adds up quick =0
---
Ik im a little late but the same thing happened to me, any fixes ?
---
honestly i don't like the food/drink system, but it will be something i'll prolly still keep an eye on.  especially if we get the perk loadouts around the same time.  then it'll take less time to swap between my combat endurance perks and dromedary/slow metobolizer/and lead belly
---
That‚Äôs what that is I was confused what the pasty taste was from!
---
Are u by any chance interested in trading
---
Wow these are absolutely amazing!
---
About the INT bonus
---
You‚Äòve tried.
---
Fair enough, Ive been wanting to get a good team together but no luck, Most people take all the loot and don‚Äôt even land together.
---
INT gives a boost to XP earned
---
CHA gives a boost to XP and Caps earned for helping teammates complete quests (at a higher rate than INT), people can also use it for better selling/buying or speech checks, but i care more about the caps/XP
---
Casual is casual, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs meant to be viable, though i‚Äôm sure someone can find a way to abuse +4 luck for crits
---
Endurance is the only stat that Unyielding doesn‚Äôt affect, so the extra HP and Sprinting AP could be helpful for some extra cushion on Bloodied builds
---
I kinda shot him with a fat man. I died aswell...
---
That happened to me. It says something will be inaccessible if I remove it. Adding stairs leading from the ground to it helped. Also, adding a foundation piece to connect them before removing the outside ones helped, too. Ditch the stairs and it should let you remove the last piece. I had to do it several times when reconfiguring my setup.
---
Found a fixer plan couple days ago for 1000 caps in a player vendor. I read that they generally sell for way more so this was a no brainer for me.
---
It gets to about 2k per around rank 33, and I think nearing 3-4K at the end
---
This would benefit people like yourself. Put on the perks go hunting for ingredients for an hour and craft it all up. Then you can change back and store all that buff food to last you the next few days. Without worrying it's all going to spoil in the next two hours.
---
wastelands added three new dailies, and a storyline that can be done in 2-3 hours. the amount of content they added was nothing in comparison to other games, and it took a year lmao
---
B 25/25 gauss rifle
---
Different rewards unlock at different rep levels.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations
---
Bss +s spear lmaoo
---
Nothing gets given to you, if that's what you're asking. 
---
You just gradually unlock more things for sale at a Faction's Bullion Vendor as you max their reputation.
---
yeah, i‚Äôve been checking player vendors, i can even afford a better price but never find them.
---
when you level up you get more options to buy from their bullion vender. i leveled up at foundation last night and unlocked the farmable tiles.
---
It would be awesome haha
---
This saved me, ty
---
There isn‚Äôt a power armor option no, but you can offset that a bit with nerd rage, emergency protocols, dodgy, serendipity, etc. You don‚Äôt get unyielding bonuses but the damage mitigation makes bloodied PA builds more than viable.
---
You can finish two games with that time!
---
I‚Äôm on a 1X and since the last patch I‚Äôve had extreme frame rate drop but only when I bring up the hot wheel. It‚Äôs really weird to have the game suddenly stagger in an online world just because I‚Äôm trying to switch to a different weapon. It otherwise has been running fine ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I wont even lie both of those are abundant, u can geyt 500 5mm as a drop from a super mutant
---
Yeah, that's the thing. I go to the ash heap and only one will start, or I go to the toxic valley and pass the buck will start but not buried with honor. I guess I'll just have to wait until they all appear.
---
And a ton of drops...
---

---
I‚Äòm not useful for pvp but if you see a bush wookie in a bear costume. Have mercy.
---
Good luck fellow dweller!
---
yeah.  so.  many.  buuuuuuuugs.
---
kills me too cause if they'd just made the game singleplayer, had npcs in it from the start, and allowed modding, 99% of the bugs would have been fixed long ago and it prolly would have sold better or at least as good as fallout 4.
---
Thanks for this.  
---
To those saying it still bugs the challenges (had a few in the last week).  Please comment with what you did to see if there a pattern.
---
So far I think it's just being logged in during reset.  The old bug was when you were logged into NW the atom dailies would bug out, so it has to be very similar.
---
20. I skip the NW ones and just try to do the dailies and weekly. I haven't really scoped out the whole board and prizes, but I love the stars wall paper I got
---
My mind is blown why isn't this a thing?!?!
---
Sometimes I spawn inside locked camps. Usually you can hop out a window (if there is any)
---
Back when I was a regular sniper, I got a 3 star. Faster fire rate. Faster reload speed. Two shot. 
---
Piper rifle. Couldn‚Äôt it be a combat rifle, a hunting rifle? No. A crappy ass pipe rifle. Which when fully upgraded. Still didn‚Äôt do as much damage as you think it does. 
---
Regardless scrapped that thing for script. And I switched to bloodied unarmed/shotgun. I‚Äôve been using the same two weapons for about 8 months now.
---
Any fixes for PC?  I'm either blinded or squinting to see in the dark.
---
Oh I believe that‚Äôs possible with the right xp run. I managed 10 levels in 7 or 8 hours recently. I was trying to make up for lost score points, the process isn‚Äôt very fun to be honest.
---
One of my favorite streamers is level 80 or 81.
---
I'm 36
---
This idea is cool. Buth Bethesda would make it bad at first, and they will start to fix it only after a million gallons of tear.
---
Bit ironic wanting to see camouflage innit?
---
Bats dont have feathers but Oxborn has a video where he says it could be a Thunderbird or a Roc (along with really old stories about massive birds in WV)
---

---
Play a few rounds of NW most days if that daily is easy. I've gotten almost all of the daily and weekly score, but have been more focused on gold and scrip than XP and play all four of my characters most days as I'm not an ally yet with any of them.
---
Most days I've found I completed all the dailies just through the normal routine. Usually the only ones I'm missing are the camp building ones which are quick (and pointless). Looking at today's list that just popped up seems like it'll be one of those times. Build and scrap five mats, yay.
---
Now if you'll excuse me I have to go pick up f'ing vacuum tubes for the 100th time.
---
I really do enjoy the game otherwise.
---
The drops are irrelevant if you can only do three daily missions and three events to grind them out. The options you have are so limited. They dry up very quickly.
---
You know it is okay to criticize something you enjoy, right? People enjoy the game. I enjoy the game. But it has problems. Wasteland was small as fuck and you cannot convince me nor anyone else here otherwise because it's pretty indisputable. It doesn't matter if you add more reasons to grind, because that's arbitrary artificial content. It doesn't do anything but keep you logging in, and you're not necessarily enjoying it after awhile because of the repetition.
---
How do we submit photos from ps4 . I have one of ward I think will fit lol
---
Try and get 10+ int, eat intelligence giving food, canned meat stew or tasty squirrel or plant variants, sleep, bobbleheads, magazines and inspiratjonal, all of those can boost ur xp. Then i'd say go kill mutants. I get 317 with canned meat and inspiratjonal only.
---
No way, that's a thing? Lmao
---
Like I said I'm still putting in the effort I need to to get the rewardsüòÇüòÇ i just wish it wasnt as much. And plenty will agree.
---
Unhealthy lol for real?
---
not really, i eat spoiled veggies and drink melon water, my water stack is never in danger of spoiling.  been meaning to switch to cranberries now that i have the rapid heal mutation, but just haven't gotten to it.
---
Should be named "waste a perk point you'll need later for legendary perks"
---
Are the servers/game world shared in any way?
---
I went into atom shop and then they showed up again. It happened just last week for me. But like today I always get charged like clock work for fallout 1st and don‚Äôt receive atoms for two days.
---
Most glitch thru anyway.  Don‚Äôt see it being a big deal
---
That nuke happens automatically every 4 hours
---
Served as ordered.
---
Jesus christ that's a shit challenge. Anyone add me on pc, Sallyuchi. Let's try this.
---
Same here but lvl29
---
I'll pat your back. If he wanted the workshop, he could have fought for it. It's not just given to him because he wants it. Like you said, it had to be done.
---
Not that either, the legendary journey is the board game style track in the menu. There's tiered rewards per rank. Some people are claiming to have finished it already even though it's meant as a 3 month activity. While technically possible, it's crazy to have played that much from 2 weeks ago to now.
---
Ah well, my peppered tenderizer is about to become less special.
---
You still got that board?
---
For now, I hope you wait till every legendary robot explodes before approaching it.
---
Let's go for it
---
81 hours out of 96 hours while also doing other stuff. Implying they had like a few hours sleep. That is unhealthy.
---
This sounds pretty interesting
---
I've played for 60 hours and I'm not even halfway through the campaign yet, it has been mainly exploring and doing side quests, there is a lot of plot lying around the wasteland, I don't know, I like that.
---
I'm pretty sure I have about 50 to 60 hours more worth of campaign without rushing it. 
---
100 to 120 hours might not seem much to the more vicious of gamers but to me it is enough, of course that more content is always welcome, I want more stories to discover.
---
loot and then cheese it
---
I‚Äôd go Serendipity 3, it effectively makes almost half of the shots on you miss. I also run stealth commando so they rarely see me coming but if they do I have more than enough survivability. 
---
Fully buttressed ss unyielding Armour w/ an armored backpack doesn‚Äôt hurt either. My damage protection rivals power Armour and I regularly shrug off queen hits.
---
All that juicy loot tho fusion cores a legendary and some more loot
---
yeah.  about one in ten games i get a team on the same wavelength as me.
---
drop out of the way, hit the unpopular and rural boxes, chill in the water/bushes until most enemies are dead, group up four to five circles in, and then pick up the pieces that are left from other fights.
---
been a few times i've won just by people being idiots with explosives, radiation, or the scorch beasts doing the job for me.
---
Ohh that picture with the Radstags feeding from the frying pan is so incredible! Nice work on that one!
---
Well, I‚Äôm sure somebody out there has the time to help you rank up. But in all honesty, what do you need help with? You get score points for getting 10,000 xp. Which you can do multiple times throughout the day assuming you‚Äôre killing stuff and doing events. The daily challenges are usually easy and simple. They can be time consuming, sure. Like looking for legendary enemies to kill. But other than that, things are usually very easy and simply to do. I usually knock out all my daily challenges within an hour or two. And I save the NW challenge for last. 
---
Join a public team, the one for Intelligence. So you can get extra experience for everything you do. Regardless of what is it. 
---
Or join a public team for events. So you can get up to 4x the xp if you feel like focusing on events.
---
It is. But the fact that a freezer doesn‚Äôt keep food for long is pretty dumb. I‚Äôd love to offer cranberry relish at a fair price for early level players who can‚Äôt craft it yet.
---
Afik sentry bots wont drop fusion cores anymore. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I‚Äôd vote for exchanging known duped legendary weapons with unlegendary rolling pins and wait...
---
I got attacked by someone who was using their fists.
---
I shot them, a lot, riddling their body with rounds.  I'm not too proud to use an advantage in a life and death situation.
---
Thanks guys for the advice. I went to my map and saw 0 Atoms, but I backed out of the server I was on and checked the Atom Shop. VOILA~ All atoms there and accounted for.
---
Thanks guys for the helpful advice. Every day is something new, heh.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to do this and have been getting the daily‚Äôs down but even then I‚Äôm kinda crippled from being a junkies build so I‚Äôm probably gonna need to switch to bloodied

Stalkers/33 vats hit/+1 per Fixer

Finally got a fixer from her stingy ass and every godamned roll was bad.

Named it "But you can't miss" and put it on the wall.  Least I get a laugh out of it every time I come home.

Hi r u on pc im tryna buy thiss

this happened to me yesterday when i was in adventure mode during the time of the reset, wtf just playing this game at the wrong time screws crap up....

These are so good I love the radstag one.

it only happens every 4 hours on the pts for testing purposes.

---
Then don't make it look like you're bragging your luck, saying that...youre lucky, and thats why i stated "or you are lucky enough"...im aware that someone could even got the suit on his first run....and even so, the point of this post is that Bethesda should fix (if its something they had to...i hope so) the repair suit problem...not the RNG, couse as a reward, the suit is a good one...and not allowing you to repair him...ffs.
---
I used more 5mm than that letting some dude on a floating tent know what I thought of them earlier. That stuff is easy to farm.

Maybe that's how they plan to add the brine to the cans. Haha
---
Best 24k caps I spend every week.

---
It would defiantly be a great thing if it was added. Restaurant roleplayers will be able to sell decent food without micro managing stock every two hours.
---
Fair enough, they did make a big mistake with some of the vehicles like the opressor and deluxo. 
---
It's amazing for missions and sourcing but a too powerfull weapon for pvp aspect.
---
They got rid of most loading screens now for businesses and free roam missions, but some are unavoidable. 
---
Biggest reason why loading screens are so long because most people load straight into online wich means it needs to search for a good host first, load into single player and then online will lower the loading screen by a lot.
---
Fallout 76 was a good idea but terrible executed, the direction is all over the place. 
---
They make it sound like a MMO but it doesn't even come close to one, they need to listen to players and what they want and make a compromise between the two for balance and enjoyability. 
---
The core of the game is fun and addictive but other than that, the game doesn't really have much to offer..
---
I want the Communist skin for my Fixer
---
I've been saying since Wastelanders releases that is the best of all the Fallouts that Bethesda developed. It is missing the high quality side quests of Fallout 3, but it improves on everything 4 had and brings back a lot of the humour and darkness that made New Vegas and all prior games so great.
---
&gt; If you see someone with rank 100 stuff on, report them
---
Or you could not be a complete dick and leave something that has no effect on you whatsoever alone.
---
Fireproof 3.
---
No Xbox
---
As a bloodied build, I promise you it makes no difference. Sure I can punch or shoot every enemy and kill it in one shot. Or two at most. But it makes very little difference tbh. 
---
Assuming I‚Äôm playing by myself. I kill everything at white spring. Everything in Welch. Everything by top of the world. And everything by the water park. After that I usually launch a nuke at the queen. 50% chance of us killing her. Depending on the lobby. Throughout all that, I usually bump into 5-8 legendary enemies. And I usually rank up about 3-4 times. Keep in mind I‚Äôm like level 290. 
---
I always create the public team. So I keep us at ‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù all the time. Except when we are in an event, then I switch us to event. To maximize our profit in experience. 
---
You‚Äôre more than welcome to add me. And if you see me online just join my world/team. It‚Äôs usually just my gf and my friend. That way you‚Äôll still get credit and caps for any events any of us do. 
---
Killer-Soldier1
---
yes bu i ended up scrapping it as i couldnt get it out to display it acted just like any other junk tried through the book shelves an display cases no option for it
---
I mean true i‚Äôm just impressed about the thoughtful reason to remove a post.
---
Maybe not a carry weight increase but, how about increased material ie like excavator, scraper and woodchuck... just an example.
---
Woah this is a great idea. Bethesda, take notes
---
Were you logged in when the new ones became active?
---
They were most likely doing it for the score challenge, they probably thought you wouldn't care since very few people keep a workshop.
---
But that's what I mean though - it's difficult to create pressure when the player has so many ways they can extricate themselves from it.  As bad as Charred Ghouls could be to an ill-equipped player, for example, they could backpedal for miles.  Goliaths work in Borderlands because things are more compartmentalized.  In Fallout, you could do it in an interior - which is probably a big reason why the new Wendigo Colossus event is set in one.
---
There aren't too many enemies that can keep up with the player and create a situation like this in the open world.  The Mothman and Flatwoods Monster could have an excuse by teleporting around, though.
---
I generally approve of the idea though.  I don't like how Legendaries are just enemies with a free health bar refill (if they even get to it) and otherwise nothing special, any more than how 3\* Legendaries drop 1\* loot.  I'm just less sure what would be a versatile, all-purpose way of making them harder without being cheesy.
---
Ah, yes... I should‚Äôve known. All the mentats are making me forget things
---
Eh. Speak for yourself. I enjoyed the game and everything it was on launch, I just think as of Wastelanders it is a competent Fallout game now. You can ignore the endgame grind and play it just as any other Fallout for the quests and exploration and really enjoy it as solely a Fallout game.
---
We "can" only hope...
---
Sorry
---
*looks at clock* ah, it‚Äôs just past noon. The reset happened
---
While I agree it‚Äôs horrible the bug hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet, it‚Äôs been suggested for some time now to be sure to log off before the daily reset
---
‚ÄúFool me once, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times shame on me‚Äù
---
I believe logging on at this time will auto complete all your challenges, it‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been in the game for I think a year. Look on the bright side, now you have the grand opportunity to spend $$$ on a fundamentally broken game!
---
U shoulda done a post on here for it I have one now just haven't felt like doing it yet
---
The mod boxes are one time use so scrapping them will remove the option to use them unless you have already learned that particular mod.
---
If you‚Äôre on XBox, I don‚Äôt mind giving you a load of 5mm, they only occasionally move from my vendor and I really just keep them there for ammo count
---
Thought a scorched glitched in and instantly blew his brains out with a rifle.
---
You are correct - this is now fixed.
---
All links are to the same calendar, so this change reflects to all.
---
If you mean the mod boxes then yeah you won't be able to craft it unless you know the plan yourself, and when you use a mod box it's consumed
---
Sure I‚Äôll add you then I gotta witness your splendour
---
It's like project paradise doesn't even exist! Lol
---
Oh ok, thanks
---
Amazing shots!
---
Today‚Äôs daily challenges are 2020 in a nutshell.
---
I was not.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I honestly did not even look for this. Thank you.  They probably thought I was touched when I hopped down the hill to get away from them.
---
Yeah, Bethesda managed to make it actually barely working now. 
---
That aside, much love to the devs, working on this game must be hellish experience.
---
U need to stop playing before the reset. Go have some lunch, watch some tv, and log in after an hour as passed after the reset. Ull never encounter the bug again.
---
Do you use Adrenaline? Not working.
---
Someone was selling 8 pies at 75 cap each. I bought 1 and left the rest for hopefully someone who wants one to get and not buy them all either
---
No, the Adrenaline perk is broken üíî
---
Yeah I read that too, and I was not online when the reset happened. Apparently it doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôve been online during the reset before with no problem
---
Thanks for doing this. I gave you an upvote. Why do we need to hit 31 or 32 today, if we are only a week and a half into this thing? I must be missing something.
---
What are today‚Äôs challanges? I‚Äôm away from home but would love what they are
---
Yea, is that going to be fixed or do they know this?!
---
I don‚Äôt really find that to be true. I usually claim workshops just to bag a bit of XP, then move on. Only once have I seen someone else contest my claim, and even then I was pretty sure it was a big misunderstanding.
---
Dude some melee 300 level came up to me in my base and started hitting me. I backed up he kept hitting i slaughtered him and moved servers. Idiots gonna idiot.
---
The game is the same. Console and PC are different servers though. All PC players, regardless of launcher, are on the same servers.
---
Oh that‚Äôs a rip, thanks for helping I was so confused lol
---
It was probably me.  I have 3 cases full now and working on a 4th
---
I always log out of adventure and close the game completely not just go to dashboard. I have never had a single challenge autocomplete.
---
If you truly were not connected in anyway to bethesda servers, then i apologize.
---
But the most common has been s being connected
---
I wish that was built into lock and load. swapping between heavy weapons takes forever
---
its not so bad with another person.  Spawn in same location by edge of map.  One person just goes into edge of fire, dies, and then you revive.  Sometimes lag can cause you to die but easy enough.  Easier than killing 9 creatures.
---
XP is easy right now. With the right perk cards, mutations, drinks, and food, I am over +20% most of my play time now. Made level 300 this morning.
---
Big Dune fan myself, I would sell my mother for Atoms to get a Fremen collectron. Be great if it quotes lines from the movie.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/4S9XutT
---
Yes. Yes, please. It would give me a reason to cook and not just live on melons. As long as it isn‚Äôt a crappy terminal interface.
---
My console was shut down, so yeah, completely offline
---
HA. I posted about this last week. I KNEW I was right about gunsmith! Didn‚Äôt know about white knight though. Damn
---
Armor has been breaking super fast since Wastelanders for me, and I always have white knight 3 on unless I‚Äôm in power armor. Is it possible it‚Äôs been broken for that long?
---
Plus this game has way more than 30 hours of content.
---
I always set up on the top of a cliff for the view. 
---
Best is in the savage divide near the ash heap. Most mountains around you so it appears the scenery never fades away.
---
They've acknowledged it and are fixing it apparently afaik.
---
Years? It‚Äôs not even 2 years old
---
Ahh sick thanks!
---
You were online when the dailies reset? Are they auto completed?
---
Its not shown up for me the past 4 days.
---
Sophie‚Äôs questline alone is more than 3 hours lol. Do you just fast travel everywhere and not bother exploring any of the new locations? Just b-line to quest markers?
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
There's been numerous posts claiming this is not a fix
---
Yes I was online. No, they did not autocomplete.
---
Get as many Exp bonuses as you can (as stated already, INT, Well Rested, Food, etc) and head inside Glass Caverns. Kill Scorched. Mine an Ultracite Node and more Scorched show up. For every node you pick, about 4-6 Scorched show up and a full run will bring in lots of exp.
---
If you no-life this game, level 100 is definitely doable.
---
A streamer I was watching play did just that. It was hilarious, but whenever I did the quest I made damn sure not to make the same mistake.
---
Still want the barrel drums, my tribal raider really fucking needs them
---
seems pretty much to be a freebie to me..
---
anyone low level is probably going to be ranking up a card as theyre leveling anyway.. and high level players almost certainly have acquired doubles of some cards from opening packs..
---
Im not really seeing a downside on this
---
That's good at least
---
That's honestly interesting it seems to spawn regularly for me, but maybe this is also why I'm always down there by myself, protecting the world's weakest tick
---
This week in xbox one servers have been practically empty, only new players from game pass. Many old players are bored, i guess..
---
I know a guy who got to rank 100 in 4 days. But you need to not have a life.
---
Also,double dailies is coming up. You can catch up then.
---
I hang out by the jukebox or play the snare to do "my role" it just jacks me off still that individuals kill off the Wendigo with out letting others get a slap in. The legendary doesn't matter i just want the junk. In RR I don't see what is so hard about mining solo as long as you know the route, no one is in your way. 
---
Maybe I'm in that high level club where exp and legendary kills don't excite me anymore.
---
I believe it's not technically supposed to happen but it does. Some times you die with one disease, respawn (with same disease), and then catch another additional disease. Can definitely happen with server hopping too. Perhaps a glitch, but I've had at least three diseases at once that I can recall. Had to use multiple disease cures to clear them all.
---
IKR I whacked him with my instigating PA damage fire axe and did 4K damage to him. Duchess did not appreciate my efforts.
---
Thank you muchly, everyone! I‚Äôve been wondering why I couldn‚Äôt locate this quest for a week now.
---
I could not find you on the PlayStation friends thing
---
This. Even at level 120 I‚Äôm still struggling for some resources. Lead is no problem now that I have my excavator PA. My main challenges are steel and plastic, and to a lesser extent, acid for smelting. 
---
I‚Äôve found that having two classes of weapons perked out (for me, rifle + shotty) is a good strategy. I carry two types of rifle (handmade and gauss) and I hoard 5.56, .45, shotgun and 2mm ammo like it was my job. When one rifle runs low I switch to the other, and when I Leeroy Jenkins a place I switch to my shotgun. And whenever I‚Äôm in the forest I‚Äôm always running around with my fire axe. Even with no melee perks I can still one-shot ghouls and scorched under level 21. 
---
With all of this, I manage to avoid situations that were typical of my early game days in which I had literally no ammo or ammo crafting ingredients and had to sneak around scavenging for enough to craft 20 rounds just to be able to defend myself on the next run.
---
I went through my other stuff to pretty much a few aid items and junk, but didn't think about notes and holos! I will do that later cheers.
---
Phew. Thanks I really want that rank 100 power armor
---
For real why does my 90%RW handmade weight 17lbs still üòÇ
---
The benefit to it is that this character is low level and would exist solely as an easy way to earn score points by completing level up related challenges. For instance, if 1 level up is required to earn score as a daily you can create a new character, pick up the perk card pack to earn your score and then delete the character.
---
No terminal just a trade window and big red button.
---
lol. I‚Äôll be home around 7ish. I‚Äôm at work at the moment.
---
Thank you so much for the positive feedback. Much appreciated!
---
Thank you. I would be honored.
---
Join me and I will feed you 5mm till you puke!
---
Ign Farplace
---
Ok i see we have another British person I presume ? I live here as well
---
Ladies and gentlemen.. We have a douchebag cheater/exploiter here.
---
Thank you so much. Glad you enjoyed them.
---
Idk I kill a few scorchbeast near prime fissure aight and check near the bright pink trees and I get 1-2 legendaries like 90% the time
---
Oh ok. Wow where am I.  Duhhhhhhh.  Thank you. I‚Äôll shut up now before I really make myself stupid.
---
Happened to me yesterday with a level 20 player. I was doing the dog hunt event and this player comes up and starts shooting me and got ‚Äúwanted‚Äù. I shot back a warning and they still tried to attack. I‚Äôm level 104. So i used my 3 star deathclaw gauntlet and tore them up. I‚Äôve usually been cool with people who mess up but this guy... uh uh... no way.
---
aren't they only 6k?
---
This is extremely helpful. Thank you!  I did not get any options for trading when I walked up to people.  Sometimes it would say ‚Äúperson wants to trade with you‚Äù but then I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make it happen.  No dialogue options popped up or anything. I think that‚Äôs why some people got mad and shot me.  I‚Äôll have to try the team thing.  I think having mic on would change everything as people could actually communicate with me. Since I wasn‚Äôt teamed up, I didn‚Äôt see that option.
---
Just to clarify. I was not logged in during the reset as I already knew that this is what causes the bug. My weekly challenges from last week also autocompleted even tho I logged in 17 hours AFTER the reset...
---
You reed the magazine so intensely you destroy the pages as you turn them.
---
Copy pasta?
---
Make sure your camp isn't too close to a workshop. Make sure you aren't seeking revenge when you are killed.
---
I take workshops all the time on PS4 and nobody ever comes to try to take them from me. It's very disappointing. People must have a sense of who will and will not fight back.
---
I've never exploited, don't don't know where you got that from, try again bud.
---
Not sure as I'm on PC but maybe someone else can help? Upvoting for visibility.
---
i want this more than the ammo converter tbh
---
Near top of world is where at the tallest point I got mine there insane view. But there‚Äôs cliffs that line whitesprings which have a god view as well as cliffs that line the more which have real nice views as well
---
üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
Same here, I did nearly 900 damage with my bloodied grognake axe and now I only do a little over 500
---
I‚Äôve got one if you‚Äôve got 8k caps.
---
Sorry, I assumed you were trying to make sure you did enough each day to reach the 100 and was trying to be helpful to let you know you still need to do more if you didn't want to level up (and doing the 250 instead of the 500 for the do all 5 will not do that). But, yes, I was making assumptions, sorry.
---
Reduced weight Junkie's Super Sledge with double swing speed has practically been my "I win button".
---
yeah this makes it less likely to happen but i logged off an hour before and in like 7 hours after and whats that \*auto complete\*
---
I noticed this today also.
---
You upset?
---
youre not using many of the good damage avoidance perks that a bloodied build would use even when not trying to be "tanky"
---
Would be even better in the sense that people who don't like the whole gathering/hunting and cooking part would be able to just buy that stuff at a player vendor. I would love to make an actually functional diner instead of serving people canned dog food..
---
Yeah, 6k but I've got four active characters
---
Ah... he does not know, you will face the harsh reality soon in this community, others who offer help is either wants to live up to expectation or self gratifying.. cling to the couple before they expire after that only reality awaits.
---
2% per int point, for all xp generating actions, rather than just event xp. 
---
Probably depends on which events you're doing. If it's low lvl events, an events team would be better.  If it's high level mob event, like line in the sand, then building team is better.
---
Some are suggesting having a building team and quickly switching to events before the end.
---
i would love to have it like the standing stones in skyrim, you use the magazine, it disappears but you'll have the effect forever untill you read a different comic
---
2% per point I believe. If you're the team leader make a building team, switch the team to an events team as the event is about to end, then switch it back to building when the event is over.
---
lol. I‚Äôm curious, what level are you that you were able to slaughter him? And what was your weapon of choice?
---
I accidentally gun bashed a guy once when trying to trade with him. When in menu, R1 tabs through categories but when out of menu it‚Äôs gun bash!! Menu closed and I clocked him. 
---
I was dead before I knew what I had done. He absolutely wrecked me. 
---
PVP isn‚Äôt my bag but I‚Äôd like to be a bit less squishy if that ever happens again.
---
Woah. This idea is actually one of the best suggestions I've ever seen on this sub.
---
\+2% per point of Int, I believe it worked out it.
---
There should be a mod for that.
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/1](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/1)
---
I think this works. Gonna give it a try.
---
Thank you! That is one of the luckiest (if not **the** luckiest) shots I've ever taken. My girlfriend and I have been taking shots of her 'cooking for creatures' using the emote and this one couldn't have been timed better.
---
Yeah I actually really like the legendary run! It gives me a long term goal and a daily I like unlike bullion! I believe it‚Äôs a step in the right direction tbh
---
Lol no
---
so it can be done with multiple characters?and the gold is unique in the account?
---
I would kiss you, but you might not have socks on.
---
It sounds like it happens to a LOT of people even tho they log out with 5-10 minutes to spare. I haven't personally had it happen but it seems like a ton of people are reporting getting it and the only pattern I've noticed is they always log out under 15 minutes of reset.
---
I know this may sound a bit annoying, obviously we shouldn't have to do this, but I feel like logging out a lot earlier like 30 minutes or more ahead of time might be a solution?
---
We really shouldn't HAVE to do this stuff but I keep seeing tons of reports saying the same thing "I logged out 5 minutes prior, still got bugged." Try something else then. Anything that would make it safer like an hour or so prior to resets.
---
Last week I logged in 17 hours after the weekly reset, still half was auto completed.
---
Level 33. Will be level 35 tonight. Maybe 36 depending on so grind.
---
If they take the suggestion as it sits. I would hope they would, but who knows if Bethesda would or wouldn‚Äôt.
---
And considering you basically have to do all the challenges to finish the pass, this sucks. Why can‚Äôt they just make progress more linked to XP and quests then have a few challenges here and there. This way of making all these stupid challenges is annoying as hell. New players can‚Äôt do a lot of them and certain challenges are nigh impossible for higher level players. It‚Äôs just plain stupid.
---
You‚Äôre probably right, but still, there were so many unclaimed workshops on the map. Poor guy.
---
Thank you. I may take you up on this.
---
I literally just took them off so be calm cowboy haha
---
Wait I thought you traded in cards for the legendary perk coins? We have to save our actual level up points?
---
I transferred to the assaultron, and the headaches continued. However, I do not recall her complaining about them since the last patch.
---
Because each level increases the amount you need to make to get to it so you can't just go by splitting the amount of levels by amount of days (cause you are going to need more experience for later levels so that would throw the math off). So what I did was total how much experience you need to make total and divide it by the assumed days we have to do it (10 weeks or 70 days) so each day you need to make the total experience divided by 70 days amount of experience to make it the full 100 levels. So by my spreadsheet (I only showed results, not the columns that did most the math, I omitted those from the image to be less confusing), today is day 13. Day 13 we need to have 13Xthe amount of experience you need to make each day to make it. Which equals to a little more than what level 31 needs and a little less than what level 32 needs (basically if you are at those levels you've made around that much experience).
---
Hey now.  I hope you were not referring to me given I took breaks to video chat my fiance, lol.  If you weren't mine was 81 hrs.
---
Ahaha that‚Äôs crazy
---
Theres been a sudden influx of really high end fixers for trade/sale  
---
I bet bethesda capitalizes on that and releases a fixer skin for 800 atoms
---
Maybe when they do instanced camps. I imagine without it would use your entire camp budget.
---
Possible, not gunsmith though, that's definitely only since last patch.
---
No way cuz I've been grinding alot harder than I'd like to admit with pretty much every exp boost possible full biuld team full unyielding mutations and I'm getting the same 500 or so exp per super mutant and about 2.2 k for every sentry bot and I'm just hitting 35 there is absolutely no way it's done legit
---
It has been suggested slightly more complex about a year ago. However since the new take on the game and items being added that were suggestions by the community I thought I would revise the idea and propose it to the newer bigger community.
---
were you in the game and then put your console into like a rest mode prior to reset
---
Speak for yourself? Bugs making you lose items and crashes from hackers exploiting a single player game engine shoved into a multiplayer game isn't a point of contention whether you enjoy it or not. That's the thing I love about this echochamber. You realize that you can enjoy a game while still pointing out its faults correct? I have over 300 hours and have gotten my moneys worth. I am still allowed to speak negatively about negative aspects of the game.
---
Oh I'm definitely not afraid of people pvp wise I roll around in a full set of assassins and a bunch of defense perks. Only have to worry about the people using that god mod glitch or people with crazy legacy or glitched weapons
---
FXAA doesn‚Äôt blur, it Fixes jagged edges very poorly because it‚Äôs trying to keep it clear but also try to make it less jagged which doesn‚Äôt really work well together, especially on a game that‚Äôs running an engine from 2011
---
I think adrenaline is still not working. Some extra points to re-distribute.
---
Trick I use is block one player for session or else stupid logic will take me to the same frigging server multiple times. Ridiculous design and could have been foreseen by anyone..
---
But a low level player will need to go through several level ups before they get a perk card they can rank up.
---
Two days ago, I ranked up all my perk cards to get the atom bonus thingy for ranking up a certain number.
---
This is one of the more challenging challenges, because it is purely 'luck based' for a lot of people.
---
Three star assaultron dominator from a random encounter in the bog. Even with full Troubleshooters armor she still downed me in about 10 seconds.
---
Yup, each character has to grind for their own gold. It's unique to that character and can't be moved.
---
If i have give a creatue a 2place it would be the lvl 100 alpha sheepsquatch
---
Building is better for most things. I think events beats it for things like scorched earth where you get huge xp if successful but there's not that much extra gained during.
---
Myself.
---
why would anyone other than a low level player.. who probably needs to rank a card up anyway.. use a perk point?
---
am I missing something?
---
Probably the Colossus, the first time I attempted to spawn it with just me and a friend. 
---
We were grossly underprepared, I just wanted to see it/fight it. I got rolled over by 15 or so wendigo spawns over and over. We eventually killed it but I died. A lot. 
---
Once prepared etc it got a lot easier but still. The Alpha Sheepsquatch is pretty tough from Project Paradise but in a different way. No real danger but very tanky.
---
I only take workshops on private server, farm them for a day, then go back to public with my thousands of lead and ammo
---
I miss read the post. I meant player levels. I think I only picked up two board levels though.
---
Theyre probably duped ones from the recent duping issue.
---
This would be the best thing to add, cause I haven't seen anyone in a casual or roleplay 1 yet so they should just switch it with 1 of those.
---
ISS. Still kicks my ass.
---
No - not cans. Mason jars. I lived in Appalachia and that's how home canning was done - with the jars.  And the jars are already in the game too.
---
Otherwise a great idea - but jars would have the feel of Appalachia.
---
It was completely shut off. But being logged out doesn‚Äôt necessarily help. Last week I logged in 17 hours after weekly reset, yet half was still auto completed
---
Bethesda‚Äôs bugs. Undefeated.
---
yeah.. there is no downside on this.. or I just dont get it at all
---
100% they are
---
No I'm across the river from the wayward, but I moved to the other side of the bridge recently and that helped for a few months now others game some the same.
---
PC? Heard theres some right crazy stuff over there though the guns that have firework effects sounds quite pretty. Luckily it's harder to do on console most op ones are the ones with stuff like explosive plasmas
---
Wendigo colossus can be hard work. I think the worst are probably glowing mirelurk kings or deathskulk scorpions. That poison just wrecks you so fast.
---
Exactly let people who enjoy that aspect do the farming and those who don't want to can buy their food. 
---
Creates a whole new market of supply and demand.
---
Have you been keeping track or did you find it somewhere?
---
Just to clarify, did you do anything of the following?: Crash during loading screen, playing NW before going in Adventure mode, checked the Atomic Shop or the The legendary Run before going in Adventure mode, Ended your previous playthrough with a NW match without logging back into adventure mode afterwards. 
---
There are the most common cases when it comes to producing the bug.
---
Yea I think the original chart is level 32 by tuesday of the second week so your doing just fine.
---
I have 4 of them
---
Her headache will be gone but Christ you will get the same voice line about her ‚Äò‚Äúdream of floating around in space forever, just why‚Äù and about how you fixed her headache
---
I regularly track down new players and give them stuff. Irks me a little when they just grab it and walk away. I gave this level 20 treated under Armour, stims, plans, and a leveled fixer. Dude grabs it, looks at me for a second, and wanders off. I‚Äôm not looking for tears of gratitude here but geez man ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Dude listen to what your saying in 4 days he could've only got 13,500 score from challenges it's a total of 220275 score to get 2 100 so he would have to complete the repeatable exp challenge 25.5 times every hr for the entire 81 hrs that's 255000 exp per hr every hr for 81 hrs.  Your gonna tell me this is done without exploits?? Dont be a sheep
---
I'm on ps4 but I've heard that there was still a time people were getting crazy glitched weapons on here also. Yeah the explosive plasma and Tesla's and stuff like that are nuts though and will wreck you through any perks and armor
---
I don't don't believe you.
---
I feel your pain on stash, I'm not a fo1st player either, but I still would choose the xp bonus in a group over carry weight, although I do think it would be an awesome alternative for some players
---
So they‚Äôre pretty common, or you are very lucky?
---
The other day I picked a lock on a water purifier in someone else‚Äôs base and immediately got a 10 cap bounty. A level 97 (I was lvl 45) followed me from the base and started shooting at me. I pulled out my BPP (non-automatic pistol build) and took them out with three shots. They then proceeded to track me down again and I used my critical on them for a one hit kill.
---
I joined a public team. Got completed instantly..
---
I looked at a U.S. map and found Point Pleasent. Looks like that river is the Ohio River and Ohio is on the other side.
---
None of the above.
---
You would have one screwed up char.. and pvp'ers would be banging you due the auto attack of 2 of them.
---
revive a player hmm thats hard to get...
---
I‚Äôve had one challenge autocomplete.  (PC).  The collect holotape one a week back. It completed during the loading screen and my score also went up accordingly.  It was easy to overlook
---
I wish I didn‚Äôt have to use all my perk points but I don‚Äôt keep super duper or ammosmith on. So I‚Äôll make a bunch of ammo at one time but then eventually I‚Äôll need to make more and I‚Äôll have leveled up like 10+ times. This may be a thing but I haven‚Äôt fidgeted out but I wish Bethesda would just let me see my cards and switch them around instead of having to use all my points and then being able to decide if I want to get a new perk or switch a point.
---
I'm sorry I lied I've merged/clipped camp items together, don't tell Todd :(
---
I will in a couple minutes
---
It depends on how you play for which teams are better. If you just go and do every single event then that may be better for you, but if you only do the bigger events and then go farm exp elsewhere with kills until another big one comes up, then building maybe better. It all just depends man.
---
Oh and 1int is like 2% iirc
---
I absolutely LOVE this.. my scorchbeast mean always ruins before I use it and all my other important food buffs
---
Criticizing actual negative points about the game is very different from what your last comment was. I have been criticizing the game since day one. However, if you're going to complain about bugs in this game, at least be consistent and complain about past Fallout games where your save could easily be corrupted by chance, and all the other game breaking bugs in, well, chose your favourite Fallout other than maybe the originals, it's there. In my 300+ hours I've had a run in with one hacker that had anything to do with ruining my personal experience. Just as you're allowed to speak negatively about the game, we are allowed to think it is worthy of praise in certain areas. It is certainly a much more playable and all around better Fallout game than 3 and 4 in it's current state, the other games Bethesda developed.
---
They can be good bargaining chips on the trade subreddit
---
Edit* they can be worth around 10k
---
Agreed. There were all over the place for awhile. That jerk took so much to kill and he would follow you if you tried to run.
---
Not counting the new and improved colossus wendigo. 
---
a 3\* mirelurk queen at the end of heart of the swamp. There was myself and a level 310 or something. I think we both died about 10 times each. I think the game was bugged as i spawned and died a few times. And yeah. I do know it has that gunk it spits at you but there was no gunk. It just seemed to take very little damage. I've killed the alpha sheepsquatch easier and quicker. 
---
After the fight we saluted each other and then i went back to my camp and realised i needed to make some ammo as i had used quite a bit. And that was when i realised i still had scrapper and super duper and gunsmith 5 on instead of demolition expert 5 and bloody mess 3 which quite clearly effected my damage output. Still. hardest fight yet.
---
Surface to air is good for getting brains for the int boost and about 1500 xp per beast if you're already high int.
---
hey, if you cook a mushroom right they can taste pretty meaty!
---
Eew! Just pull the trigger! God damn scorched people re disgusting! Just imagine the smell...
---
The downside is that when you max cards you don't get more doubles from packs,they just vanish. If not for that ,there would  be no problem as you'd just scrap the upgraded card later.
---
Thankfully it isn‚Äôt required to get the gold.  I had numerous perks I haven‚Äôt used or upgraded so good time for that.  For new characters it‚Äôll just be luck
---
Wow those are good
---
I would love this. But is it weird I also kind of wish there was a tiny chance of food poisoning when consuming canned pre-war foods?
---
I was online during the reset and nothing autocompleted. [Xb1] Not sure that is the only factor.
---
The only time my dailies auto completed was when I was playing NW before the reset then went into Adventure mode. So I make sure I log off, then back on and then fast travel somewhere to establish an autosave. So far, so good.
---
Ranked up doing the previous challenge, and aren't bushes where it kept ending yesterday nor water
---
I had that same issue, but after I server hopped and join a team with people in it the challenge completed.
---
EDIT: Just server hop and the others should complete too, if not I'm not sure then because i completed a majority of them.
---
Usedshark7863
---
Dude it is not possible I did the math. The guys says he finished in 81 hrs over 4 days in the first 4 days he could've gotten 13500 score from challenges he would've had to complete 25.5 repeatable exp challenges every hr for the entire 81 hrs
---
The original comment spoke of the game getting unnecessary flame or hate. It is well deserved and they have learned from it. Yes it is more polished at this point than other Fallout games. Bethesda is horrible at bug fixing as I am well aware. That does not in any way make it okay for this one to have the same issues.
---
Nah. Travel with your team. If one gets gunned down, try and take out the enemy and then revive them.
---
Its because you consume them... Yum books
---
I feel ya. I stopped playing several weeks ago and honestly I haven't missed it. I haven't even tried any of the new C.H.O.R.E. system because I would have to sink so many hours into this game. I work 40~50 hours a week and I have a daughter. Believe me, there are better ways to spend my time than watching people afk at events and one shot all the legendaries. I may come back and dabble from time to time but maybe I'll just hold out for cyberpunk and be happy with my free time.
---
This is so sad :(
---
I transferred it to the assaultron and she said her headaches are gone, think that was fixed, too.
---
So in both ways her headaches will go away.
---
As if i watched the video and didn't just skim it.
---
I spent 7k on one cba playing that event
---
Addition: if you think about scrapping the boxes for the components, this is incorrect sometimes. Ibought two mods from a player vendor cause description said they contained ballistic fibre. When i scrpped them, there was only glas, rubber &amp; steel given and absolutely no fibre. If you have mods you won't need try selling them for cheap, chances are you won't get the listed components so you are better off with 10 caps for selling.
---
Something has to be causing this.
---
Me, I've never had an issue. I've been logged in when they change, and have never had any of them auto complete.
---
Not in game yet. Planned for update 22 I believe.
---
You just need to use as many xp gaining tricks as possible. Food and rest buffs, Unyielding armor if you have it as high intelligence gets you extra xp. It's boring but hitting West Tek and Huntersville repeatedly is probably the best way to catch up. Fully buffed my toon is getting over 1k per mutant so those 10k challenges soon stack up.
---
They are not in the game yet.
---
Well its kill or be killed
---
So then, what type of anti-aliasing should I use?
---
This has been mentioned before and even had Bethesda mod respond.  The issue is there has to be a negative offset for the positive of infinite shelf life.  
---
I‚Äôve been working on a detailed list for this and a leather working station as well for hunting.
---
Mainly my theory would be infinite shelf life for a 1/4 effectiveness / bonuses of fresh food.  Also, you‚Äôd need salt with every recipe.  And rads
---
Perfect solution tbh.
---
That makes a lot more sense, I just didn't want to miss out
---
Why did you waste five hours trying to level up?
---
Make a new character and take it to NW.
---
Level up in like 1 or 2 matches, dependent on how you do.
---
Thank you. I‚Äôll use my lunchboxes right now
---
They were really easy honestly.
---
You still get +1 INT for being on a public building team by yourself, though.
---
Just be proud of urself! There is no need to tell everybody...
---
At this rate they add a new public event every 6month , I think it just 1 dev working on public events 
---
I‚Äôm be honest I have high expectations for the daily ops coming in September update. I hope they are some kind of dungeons atleast 5 new ones... 
---
I hope it more then just a daily go kill xxx mission
---
So you get the cards in the packs, but they disappear? Am I understanding that correctly?
---
I thought they just piled up.
---
I feel like every Bethesda game should have an arena.
---
2 3\* Mirelurk Kings together in the Wendigo Cave. It was awful.
---
I thought legendary perks are not active yet?
---
Make you own "building" team, and switch to "event" on the fly when you are near completing an event. You can do so in the social tab / party by right clicking your own name (if you are a leader). The change is instant and there is no cd / reset on the team connection thingy bar on players. Switch right back after you get completion popup. Nobody notices (or cares) if the team changes to "events" for couple of seconds. As there is no popup or warning that group purpose has changed. I do this all the time to max xp gains.
---
Confirmed, happens to me too, especially when it's late in the evening.
---
Hemlock is easiest to take, four ghouls is all I‚Äôve ever seen there
---
Getting people to do PP is like pulling teeth, not sure why it's so unpopular.
---
Wow, after my 3rd world jump, it finally popped... nutty
---
Whats griefing these days? Roleplaying raiders was considered griefing when i started
---
I have nearly a hundred. They used to spawn at the top of west tek so you could pick one up everyday. I'm not sure they spawn there anymore.
---
Yeah I put it on .308 and get maybe 200 rounds in about 4 hrs of gameplay plus it cant make fusion cores or 2mm. I dont believe it can make cryo or fuel either
---
lol that‚Äôs kinda half the point of Reddit though...
---
Yea I never said report any body cuz like I said them having the stuff first doesn't affect me but they'll be crying for somthing new to do in a week. But what I'm saying is just dont go flaunting it and saying you did it legit cuz then guys with relaxed to much cuz they'll think they can make it up in like 1 weekend they'll be sorely mistakin when the go to try for themselves
---
I have never heard of this contest, maybe I'll get in on the next one.  Great photos!
---
Save some for double xp weekend.
---
Yes. Go to your room.
---
how quick do you think it takes for a full geared character to run through westek one hit killing everything and not stopping to pick up anything. 
---
I think they said they were bloodied and using a DCG. Or that might have been someone else in the thread. And they did do other stuff as well. Events give good xp on completion. 
---
Also once again. I think they started at about 34. Don't forget they would have had 4 lots of daily challenges as well and depending when it was possibly a weekly reset as well.
---
Pop out the the main menu
---
That's weird, i only server hopped once and it popped for me... but at least its done so you don't need to worry about that now.
---
I am not sure me telling you an easier way to level up is being an arsehole, but each to their own.
---
I am just stating if you made a new character, it wouldn't have been five hours.
---
Why melons? I see a lot of people growing them but never know what they're used in.
---
Thank you for the reminder üëçü§û
---
FWIW:
---
- 5-7 days ago I was logged out, I logged in after the daily reset -&gt; bug
---
- two days ago I decided to stay logged in during the reset -&gt; bug
---
- today I forgot to log out so I was logged during the reset -&gt; **no** bug on the dailies
---
They do as long as you have only the lvl 1,maybe two. But as soon as you find the animated version or have one for each level,they disappear when dropped from a pack. There are little exceptions but it's mostly like this.
---
That why i always pack my 3* Troubleshooters Explosive Fixer...i hate robots...only things that give me problems.
---
The problem is this game seem to be some kind of mmorpg hybrid.. so mmorpg players like myself have higher expectation for endgame content 
---
The game is full of thing yea but they are very doll content compare to other mmorpg like FFXIV , ESO or even destiny 2
---
Edit: and just to be clear wastelander or upcoming brotherhood of steel are STORY CONTENT while they are fun and good to do . It a different kind of content this game needs
---
I'm down for whatever vessel to store the food. Maybe Cans for the Meat goods and Mason for the Fruits and Veggies?
---
I think it was the fact that at least several people said it was unhealthy behaviour. not just one.
---
try sharing sun kissed in a group of bloodieds. that‚Äôs gross.
---
I think its a stretch to be mad at this easy peasy challenge..
---
&gt; a low level player will need to go through several level ups before they get a perk card they can rank up.
---
any low level player even looking at this is likely already charging levels anyway.. 
---
&gt; This is one of the more challenging challenges, because it is purely 'luck based' for a lot of people.
---
I cant imagine there are many people who dont have at least one double from opening packs by the time they are level 10.. for higher level players its is a certainty 
---
having too many doubles is a problem people bitched about for the longest time...
---
this challenge should be a problem for exactly nobody
---
I‚Äôll save some. When is it?
---
Bethesda will do it but only if you have to use a terminal to do it
---
They spawn at Westek on the roof...
---
Anyway how does it taste? Is it any good?!
---
I have a bloodie explosive gat plasma and in power armor it's just over powered, personally I hate to say it but they need to remove it or nerf it. I am level 210 but that doesn't matter it's the build and weapon I used. I did not make a mistake, he wasn't making a mistake, he tried to trap me in a corner and make me leave server and I got out backed up he came to hit me again I jumped and slaughtered in literally less than 1 second.
---
My, my, my, a lot has changed. The SCORE and gameboard thing are the newest editions, its Fallout's version of a battle pass, called SEASONS. Every rank you get a reward. To earn score, you do the daily and weekly challenges in the challenges tab
---
Yea they are there in the forest area behind white springs. Though sometimes I think there is a glitch because I‚Äôll use vats and find one and then I hear it die immediately without a shot fired. And yea it seems to be working out quite well for you haha I‚Äôm still only 31 on the board I don‚Äôt know how people can grind out like 300,000+ xp a day and I‚Äôm running like 60+ int with chems, teams, food and what not and then I have +5% well kindered and +25% xp and sometimes +5% from mothman and I‚Äôm still only getting like 15000 from white springs. I did notice a huge difference when people would pop lunchboxes though so I‚Äôll just save that for double xp.
---
I second this. Canning is still a pretty big thing in West Virginia, and I've only ever seen it done with mason jars.  
---
I used to work with a lady who made and canned her own salsa, and also her own pickles. Still the best damn pickles I've ever had.
---
Stick with the default TAA.
---
I have tested this Build vs. Event xp gains and back to back queens I ranked 4k xp with build team and 3876 xp with event team. 
---
All buffs the same. Same teammates etc.
---
To be fair he really might not have known how workshops/pvp works. I'm lvl 60 something having played the last few months and I only have a vague idea how contesting workshops works. The only thing I know about it is the little message that pops up saying "pvp can be initiated" or whatever. Because I've never contested a workshop and no one's ever contested one of mine in the 130~ hours I have.
---
You are...but I find this hilarious ü§£
---
Oh that sounds neat! How late am I to this "season"? I was looking at some of the rewards and I really want that like  secret door but thats probably impossible at this stage, eh?
---
Just another way to grief in a game prone to it. Nothing new.
---
Somehow I expected this theme ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvZE4BY0hY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzvZE4BY0hY)), which turns out to be the Fallout 4 theme (which is awesome as well).
---
So it's best stay in a fully bonded build team throughout?
---
Negative effects could include. 
---
Higher weight due to the cans and fluids. 
---
Cost of the Resources to can. 
---
Time to can just like the Fermenter. It can be a slower process. 
---
Or many others... however not everything needs a negative. Or at least a great negative. Bulking costs only 2 plastic but allows me to sell my junk for caps. A far greater benefit then just 2 plastic.
---
I love the mothman photo.
---
i mean, it doesn't even really exist, right?
---
I just want to be able to display the musical instruments, wanted to display the banjo, acordian, steel and acoustic guitars, but they can‚Äôt be. So instead I have a snare drum, drumsticks and a violin in a glass display case and amongst the figurines on the thanksgiving display case a harmonica.
---
Canned glowing fungus stew.
---
Sign me up.
---
But you forgot that at launch it will only allow you to make five cans a day.
---
Then a couple weeks later it'll be better.....maybe.
---
ok.. but who has all the cards in the game maxed? lol
---
youre trying too hard for this to be a big deal.. its an easy challenge yo
---
...you were stealing water lmao
---
Daily Legendary run [BUG]. A Teamate (chat good friend) PS4/PSN &lt;COUCHIEKILLIU&gt;
---
was in an event when the daily legendary run quests reset and it showed I already completed 2 daily quests no LR points given! This the SECOND TIME DAY this has happened when the daily LR reset! PLEASE HELP
---
The red dress is common anyway, it's a fluff item for pleasant valley tickets.
---
No Terminals. Trade interfaces and a Big Red Button. Or I will tear up this idea haha
---
I actually didn't know about workshop pvp untill after I was 60. I got fallout 1st almost immediately though. I'm the junk hoarder for 7 people.
---
If only all griefing were so tame, and with actual benefits...
---
The only other thing I can think of is losing your internet connection for even just half a second during the loading screen. That, and Bethesda's incompetence.
---
I think so. May be worth testing on events u can run back to back. 
---
Overall for a few hundred xp I think it's better to build team all the time. 
---
I have read that there is a correlation between CHR and event xp as well. So maybe that factors in on events too.
---
hack the game, really.
---
make Todd so angry he swears on twitter...
---
or wait, either way
---
Not saying what you did I'd wrong. It was a learning opportunity for them.
---
just rank up some other bogus card you dont use but have a double of from opening packs?
---
Or rad sponge, but that's just mean. I don't want to actually mess with someones build.
---
Last night I couldnt see any but my teammate could see them so idk what the issue is.
---
Level 332 here Im at 465 lbs carry weight im a vanguard heavy weapon build with 3 pieces of unmodded ss armor usually run around with 200lbs on me with only batteries included and bear arms only perks i use that mess with weight it would be very useful for low levels though
---
For sure, been a complaint for as long as the game has been out and they do need to fix it. If you're on pc I can give you a boatload of stims/5mm.
---
Cuz I've already talk to a few guy (on xbox) that are under the assumption that theese people grinded to 100 legitimately so got really lax on doing there challenges cuz they think they can make it up in one weekend, and there going to go try down the road and be upset when they have no shot
---
Are you sure? There are ways to hit over 60 int + who knows how many xp items that will stack without using exploits. Then you can bug your unyielding out to double the bonus leaving you in or around 80. The method angry turtle shows off in a video isn't even optimal and he got nearly 700xp per mutant.
---
I think the worst part is the won‚Äôt do anything about it. I believe them when they say they can‚Äôt grant you the lost score. But at least they could give you some atoms to buy all your lost levels.
---
Yeah stick with TAA it‚Äôs blurry but it‚Äôs looks better
---
I think we all know which red dress I'm talking about
---
Yep just got this on Xbox today and lost out on legendary loot
---
I still get a lot
---
I just lost 1500 SCORE there an hour ago !
---
5 Daily Challenges auto-completed. Rotten thing. One is even the 'Gold Star' to complete 5 challenges, yet it is one of the five, so that doesn't even work or make sense if there are only four others auto-completed.
---
I'm not a robot. I,m not just going to remember to log out before the FO76 'gaming day' resets...I was having fun...!!
---
It's my actual birthday today, so thanks Bethesda for yet another bug in the game to put me in a bad mood today of all days.
---
I filed a ticket with screenshots of the Challenge page, 5 minutes into the day, showing 5 done in 5 minutes...good luck to anyone who can do that with full minute loading screens sometimes...
---
Is there a screenshot function? If so, go to photo gallery, hide the interface, and screenshot the photo you took. That‚Äôs how I do it on Xbox.
---
Did the same thing first time round
---
I was just thinking of the most clunky way possible which is likely how they‚Äôd do it
---
I think it's becouse of how much BS goes on. The event came around when the game was still kinda new as such most of the time with it your just waiting. So for me PP is basiclly a hurry up and wait event. Not to mention the lack of rewards for doing it, sure you get a lab coat wippy fucking do da with all the dupers now, *just going to say you guys keep doing you I have over 10k presents* with dupers now rare outfits aren't all that rare now.
---
Fantastic! I especially like the Mirelurk Queen/Sheepsquatch Fight, and the cute one where he‚Äôs feeding the Radstag.
---
Me too now
---
I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll probably quit before I even make it to the end of the board... While this person is thinking about rewards for next season.
---
What's the point.. I just spent 2hrs gathering junk and bulking it together just for it to disappear the moment I stash it..
---
Lock and Load is also half broken. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
---
wrong sub
---
Maybe as paintings in your camp. Starting to grow tired of the same ones over and over. Would add alot to your house!
---
Good idea tho
---
I can already hear the spice must flow in a protectron voice lol.
---
Just realized, thanks man
---
I could live my dream of filling the wasteland with corn soup. Yes please
---
whatever rank gives you the playground piece... 25 maybe?
---
Usually 3-5 Legendaries at whitesprings.  
---
the cottage /golf club loop is also good for about 8k xp for the repeatable.
---
What griefing do you mean??
---
Next weekend or the weekend after I think. There's a bonus score weekend coming up too. They've upped the amount of daily challenges too so it's getting easier to catch up. Take full advantage of building teams and the inspirational perk too. Every bit helps.
---
I want it too. My raider toon is a hoarder and his camp is stacked full of trash, boxes, crates, etc etc.. Huge piles of crap. I want Todd in the middle of it all.
---
Let me guess you wanted to buy one for an insanely low offer and someone wants market price and you went "bUt ITs BeEn dUpEd!"
---
Things are worth what people will pay and what the owner values them at and until beth takes action and the characters banned the market is in even more of a flux than normal. I can say from marketing my tattered field jacket its extremely easy to still get top dollar for one.
---
Protip: The rare outfits look stupid anyway. Its hard to treasure something just because its a collector. Looking at your legendary the dragon + resolute veteran.
---
Thank you very much!
---
melon juice.
---
That's exactly how I feel. The game has a ton of content. The problem is that people want to keep playing long after they finished everything. It's not that type of game.
---
Once you finish all the content, take a break. Play something else for a few months then see what's new in 76.
---
Interesting. So far I've logged out...
---
10, 15, 20, 45 before.  
---
But I've always left it at least 10 mins to after
---
You can buy it in whitesprings shops for like under 100 caps
---
4-10k, I tend to sell them for 4999 but I've seen them between those ranges consistently.
---
first time i did that event i got the backpack
---
Then play something else.
---
You're gonna carry that weight...
---
I have to say, once I get my fixer plan, Encryptid will join Crater, Foundation, Biv, and Radiation Rumble on the timeout bench for a while.
---
Do NW revives count for the Field medic trophy?
---
That one has a .63% chance of dropping. It's about the middle of the pack with percent chance.
---
I love it! I‚Äôve got 90 unused perk points
---
I personally like post-apocalyptic hide and seek
---
We need more end game raid type bosses. Add unique skins for guns, armor, camp items etc to their loot pool to give us a reason to grind them.
---
Encryptid sheepsquatch is hands down the toughest enemy in the game. Otherwise laggy ghouls, and the assaultrons with buggy back to back lasers when you get staggered.
---
Its not too late https://bethesda.net/community/topic/416564/around-appalachia-photo-submission-thread-creature-feature?language%5B%5D=en
---
25 seems like a lot. Maybe 10
---
Thats really useful. Had no idea
---
Did you get this worked out? I have an extra S‚Äômores plan.
---
I don't know.
---
I completed the Trophy list long before Nuclear Winter was a thing.
---
Reequip it in the atom store.
---
Is it patched? Today I couldn't make it work but it worked yesterday.
---
YES PLEASE I hate seeing my fine cooked scorchbeast pastries wither away
---
That's true for prime receivers, but it is not true for PA base plans or mods.
---
the mounted cat-head is also fun
---
I have 3 fixer plans, think they go for 10k caps
---
That doesn't excuse it first of all, and second of all you have no right to tell someone to play something else. Bethesda wants us to keep playing, they should give us more content. I'm having fun playing the game so...
---
Zorbo moves once per day, you move when you fill your S.C.O.R.E. Meter. when done with your dailies you could grind XP to fill the repeatable challenge constantly for a small boost.
---
Well, Bethesda want us to keep spending atoms.  If we're going to do that, we need to keep playing the game even now, after a year and a bit.  Those main quests, side quests, dailies (which are basically quests), and events (which are basically quests) are largely pretty good but they won't keep people's interest for *that* long.
---
Its very Firefly feeling to me tbh but I've been a Browncoat much longer
---
We are about to finish up week 2 of a 10 week season
---
Tesla rifle with the tent glitch. tag everything as soon as it soawns and watch the xp flow
---
does nobody care about recycling?
---
If you're on PC, depends on what you got.
---
But think about how much that would suck when you're near max weight with a fully bonded team and then 2 or 3 people back out and switch servers.
---
A couple people priced it 5k - 6k. If no luck then 10k it is
---
So is there a way to do without killing him?
---
My team and I were discussing the value of the ice box since food still spoils, and also one team member wanted to make a restaurant but all vended food spoils. The idea I gave was this: the vender robot with the donuts in his head has been pretty cute and popular. What we need is a chef bot. He is behind his little grill with an empty inventory. You dump food and baking items in his inventory, and every so many minutes he has cooked food available for you. It doesn‚Äôt start spoil until you take it.
---
No to hijack the thread but if you have a second uniform you're willing to sell I'll buy it. I've run the event 200+ times and never got the uniform. Its driving me nuts. I can trade it for a flag plan or caps. Your call.
---
This sounds amazing, but I don't want it in the game because they would ultimately find a way to fuck it up and ruin the very idea.
---
Same. Its wierd
---
Just switch to events just before she dies for couple of seconds, and then right back to building after the event completion popup to get best of both group types. The player bond does not reset and the change is instant.
---
i find it so funny when people start asking stupid questions like that 
---
to give u some context of the game: we're in a post-apocalyptic appalachia with radiated animals and insects 10x their normal size, then there are several groups trying to kill u for some bottlecaps or because u just walked in the wrong area.. in short: everything tries to kill u, so gear up!!
---
I‚Äôll swap revives, my psn is distant-travels
---
It‚Äôs rare Ish. You can continually get them at the moment. I sell them for 12k regularly in my vendors
---
It‚Äôs OK friend, we all have bad days.
---
Haha True but if it becomes possible even with limitations it would open so many new doors to food and it's Buffs.
---
How?!?!?!?!? Ive never been able to not kill him!
---
In all fairness i dont keep an eye on prices too often  as i rarely delve into market subs
---
I'll take 5k for it, but will have to wait until ive spent some caps
---
I would love this, I'm tired of wasting 3 whole luck slots just to keep food buffs a possible thing. Sure the buffs last 30 minutes but the food and ingredients last about 15 without good with salt.
---
I am foolish haha. But I'd love to see this implemented.
---
The normal one
---
There is an influx of new players due to game pass. I'm seeing a ton of low levels in my world now. Don't let it phase you
---
Also it takes 10 cans to make one clean one because reasons.
---
But there is only so much content that can be pumped out though, isn't there?
---
Is there a point to going back in there?  Do new mobs spawn in?
---
Beefbus511 is my gamer tag. I‚Äôll work on getting 5k or more caps. This is my first and only time on the market. I thought it would be a little more harsh but so far it‚Äôs not too bad
---
Fallout 76 is close in that it sorta follows previous fallout games in regards to game play. Chances are that the things you liked about 4 and new Vegas are not in 76.
---
If we're being honest, they don't care about the story with those items. They care about the money. That's all there is to it. Why spend hours writing up lore and storylines when you could just.... not.... and still make money
---
A mini game like the lockpicking but instead of twisting a bobby pin your awkwardly trying to hand stuff the food into the can xD
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind this at all. Would be a nice change up for the standard build weapons.
---
Oh okay rad. Do the weeks have different rewards like part of the board or does that not matter?
---
Realistically we should be able to do this with the cooking station and some mason jars
---
Camp budget says no.
---
Holster weapon and redraw. That will fix reload.
---
The bulk of the stuff in the Atomic Shop are not Canon, mostly because they CANNOT be.
---
Liberty Prime was a top-secret Military Weapon that wasn't even completed by time of the Great War, so there can't be a Power Armor based off of it.
---
The Chinese did not even USE Power Armor, so the Red Shift Power Armor is right out the window.
---
Sure, stuff like weapon skins and silly outfits could be canon, cause you could just paint a gun or find them at a cheesy Halloween shop. But the crazier, more notable stuff? It's impossible.
---
Fallout 76 itself has a ton of issues with Canon (Looking at you, Appalachia Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel and Hellfire Power Armor).
---
Okie dokie.
---
I'm at work for a few more hours, but i'll pm over xbox when i can sell to you
---
Colossus for sure.
---
Thank you. Ok. So, I missed the first day and have done everything since, except for the NW and I am at 26. That‚Äôs a bit disappointing. Here‚Äôs to hoping they expand the earning potential later in the season. I felt like I was on a good track, since I was committing several hours a day to getting these done. I‚Äôm trying real hard not to be pessimistic, like some others.
---
Thank you! I appreciate it
---
Which machine actually pays out?? I've tried several but nothing
---
Sent a FR.
---
Unsure I guessed to make sure you can hit the season 100 by just doing dailies? Or maybe there‚Äôs a weekend on
---
Yes they are and I agree!
---
Why can't there be devs at Bethesda with these types of ideas? Stuff that's actually helpful and convenient. Should be them coming up with this shit, not the players.
---
Of course.  Frankly, I think the content in Wastelanders was good, but it was too easy to burn through the interesting stuff quickly, and be left with the repetitive grind part.  I think they should have split the grind up a bit more, spread the content over a longer period, if they didnt want a good portion of players to end up bored with the end state.  But hindsight is 20/20 I guess.
---
Always looking for crew members. Should be on later today
---
Double dailies means dailies give double score. They are giving us an additional daily challenge. What is there to complain about?
---
For sure! Should be on later today
---
Dude not even, I have one and don't care either way for it. Thing is since dupe everyone has one. Becoming a bit of an eyesore if anything
---
Definitely knock 25% off the buff when canned tho or something that makes the original meal better
---
Probably rushed through the story with an overpowered build and gear, and skipped most dialogue. Anyway, [this playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VWUE1byzT4&amp;list=PLwH1xJhcXG0eMd8qhbXLVdKy_Tz5R8Sc0) might be more comparable to an average player without skipping content, and it is 12 parts ranging from ~60-90 minutes, with uninteresting bits of gameplay edited out. The Wastelanders update also added more NPC voice acting than Far Harbor and Nuka World combined. Especially for something that is free, I would not call it "small as fuck" in any case.
---
[This site](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=57416) says the original main story (without extras) takes ~34 hours to complete on average, although their sample is only about a dozen players.
---
We need more camp budget first.
---
Todd Howard In the middle of a pile of crap. Sounds about right
---
The ammo converter wasn't that bad. Once you convert your years worth of accumulated ammo it works pretty well. Of course I admit the UI could've been better.
---
Ahhh so they are taking up spaces of the vets. I‚Äôm happy to hear that new people are playing but dang lol.
---
And we can find plans at mama dolces
---
Weekend?
---
I have a furious explosive 90r lmg?
---
I hate that bastard...
---
I feel like a dungeon would be more intersting. But yeah, waves of enemies would be neat.
---
I like this. Time is a commodity in this game, stuff that doesn‚Äôt expire holds nice value, as long as it was expensive enough and balanced to make it worth it but also somewhat of a resource sink it would be brilliant.
---
Please help with the NW - how do I easily find stimpaks?
---
For context: I have a ton of water at my base. But I‚Äôd never seen one with a lock so I picked it.
---
A three star legendary Angler near Dolly Sods camping ground. Its acid spit was manageable but it had silly high resilience to energy and ballistic.
---
The thing that was tooth-grinding about it though was its ability to close the gap in a blink and melee 75% of my health somehow.
---
It cost three plasma cores, 300ish .50cal and two broken secret service armour legs. On the positive side, I found out I could die 10 times over and still be able to collect my junk.
---
It got personal.
---
That's one of the things about legendary perks. People are going to be justifiably upset when they break and it is not addressed in a timely matter.
---
It‚Äôs a decent game and it really depends on what you want from it.It doesn‚Äôt have that many quests,but it has quite a lot of lore and side stories from before the war.If exploration is your thing you might like 76.It‚Äôs a lot about grinding in the late game if you want to be have the best armor/weapons.If you like making builds in RPGs you will have a lot of fun.
---
A lot of the game is the community so if you don‚Äôt like to interact with others,you might not like it that much.The gunplay is basically upgraded fallout 4 and it feels more survivaly too.You gotta is eat and drink,you have diseases and mutations.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm running out of things to do,but I can safely say I enjoyed the time I spent in game.The fact that it‚Äôs still supported with new content is why I still haven‚Äôt uninstalled it.And that I never uninstall Fallouts.
---
I'll jump in on this with you dude, you free now?
---
11000 caps, its all i have.
---
Totally agree.
---
What about Anchorage?
---
A higher capacity auto that builds up charge as it's fired would be a cool weapon for tougher enemies, basically an inbuilt furious ability. Probably would need to be a rare event plan or bullion item.
---
How much are you willing to sell for, good sir?
---
What‚Äôs ign?
---
Yeah, I hope I didn't come across as asking too many questions that I could've just searched, heh. I was focusing more on meta and stuff I couldn't figure out just from that.
---
I actually asked my quest rewards question \*because\* of that pyro SMG. I wasn't expecting to suddenly be handed one for the quest it was linked to, so now as much as I like it, it's kind of taking up room in my stash box while rapidly falling behind in use.
---
I have found more information about this I have found notes from bos members about how they will be returning to the atlas observatory and I‚Äôm I‚Äôm currently examining the words from the newest broadcast trying to put them into sentences
---
Yes I am
---
Why downvote him? Should everyone else give it away for free? Maybe is the only thing worth it that this user has and needs the caps. The other user needs the plan, a rare plan. Should we just giving him 10 for free? Isnt this how fcking capitalism works in your beloved 50 star flagged country?
---
I can't find a straight, true answer on this but I'm pretty sure we are never meant to pass him, it's just a graphical gimmick for the immersion factor of a board game. I'm sure we'll all meet him on the final piece whenever we get there and we will 'beat him'. He's just there to show the passage of time with the season. If he makes it to the end before you, it'll probably only be on the final day of the season.
---
haven't done it today. worked yesterday two out of two. 
---
try adjusting the tent if they spawn normally.
---
Considering the name ‚ÄúScavengers‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt it also make sense to get more xp from scrapping ‚Äújunk‚Äù. Also Bethesda may just do a increase in luck since its scavenging and it is based off of luck of how many caps and bullets you get.
---
Events for XP, stick to the main questline and as soon as you have the factions of raiders and settlers get the chinese stealth armor from the settler missions and then decide which faction you really want to go with. Picked raider faction and missed out on the stealth armor because I didn't know about it. Good luck! 
---
PS: If your PS4 I could help you. Just send friend request. Username: Sammoss226
---
Aurick411, won‚Äôt be on for a bit. Family stuff
---
I joined at least 5 maps with less than 15 players. The others with more players were dead. I cannot foresee the game surviving without any new content. I didn't do dailies or most events before the legendary run and there is nothing that enticing in the rewards to do them now. There is really not much holding my interest
---
How do we do this dude? I'll drop you a message now to invite me
---
I fear no man but that thing it scares me
---
There's a lot of quests, but that doesn't make it good, it just makes it big.
---
You don't need stims to revive players in NW. But you find them in crates or world containers.
---
I believe they are closely watching peoples progress and adjusting the score gains. Adding more as it looks like its gonna be too much of a grind and too hard to finish for most people. Atleast i hope this is the case.
---
Glass does need some kind of use as a material, but both jarred and canned should be an option
---
Had the same issue today. Haven't been on since yesterday at 8 x.x
---
Not saying it happens for everyone, it's obvious it doesn't. I was just adding on to your comment that people should definitely report on it and no one really is outside of "I logged out 5, 10, 15 minutes before, still got it!" 
---
I personally have logged out within an hour and logged back in within an hour of reset and been fine.
---
Sounds like it's truly just random but logging on/off near reset time tends to increase that chance according to posts.
---
Seconded. I‚Äôm claimed my first workshop yesterday at level 83 for the SCORE challenge and only vaguely remembered they could be contested when I read the OP‚Äôs post.
---
It's pretty easy too when nobody I knows plays 76 anyway lol
---
I actually chose shotguns as a weapon of choice because they seemed less perk reliant than other options (and also because I'm not fantastic at sniping). I'm not planning for this to be a big meta build for my first character--more of a character concept--so if I need to get into hardcore gameplay or want to do Nuclear Winter, I'll probably have to build a new character for that.
---
I do plan to have enough points to take Enforcer and at least one shotgun damage boost card, though.
---
They JUST released RDR2 in 2018. Literally the same year as FO76 &amp; while there haven't been nearly as many updates, it also released with a full fledged story &amp; wasn't broken in almost every conceivable way. RDOnline may have fizzled out but people do still play it &amp; let's not act like either game is the new WoW.
---
Skyrim is also older than GTAV by two years on top of everything so they're rereleasing an even older game than GTAV. Just because they haven't announced anytjing doesn't mean they're not working on anything. In all likelihood, GTAVI is their next big game and then a possible RDR3 if they stick with their pattern the way Bethesda sticks with the TES/FO pattern.
---
Also Bethesda didn't make Doom/Doom Eternal.
---
Do the wayward quests, place your C.A.M.P. wherever (you can change it later, easy)... get the crafting benches set up (armor, weapons, cooking, etc) and some resources like water, corn (take some corn from outside wayward to plant)... 
---
Also, get the Tinkerer's Workbench and Chemistry Bench plans ASAP (tinkerers is sitting somewhere at lake side cabins)....
---
early on, just having Boiled Water in the inventory is convenient. 
---
Don't worry too much about armor (use what you find)....
---
To set up an idea of what perks/cards per level  to choose check out:
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks 
---
just to get an idea of what you want... etc
---
and have fun
---
Lmaoooo I like your style
---
I just wish the ammo machine made all ammo at the same rate. It'll make 200 rounds of 5.56 in less than an hour but will take 4 hours to make 333 rounds of .45. If you don't empty the hopper, you're wasting time as it caps at a certain amount. That's ridiculous and I can't believe someone actually got paid real money to design that let alone someone signed off on that design.
---
I never said it's hard,just that it's useless now.
---
If you were higher level you'd understand.
---
Thus proving people will complain about literally anything.
---
Alright cool, my Gt is The Rustard. You can add me and I can join whenever.
---
Ohh I would love to see more of those.
---
If I can make dog food I'm golden
---
As you mentioned elsewhere in this post, this has been suggested before. I support this idea and would love to see it implemented. 
---
I think it should require Purified Water; that‚Äôs not only a bit more realistic but also gives an option to use Purified Water for cooking, which has been a request for a long time.
---
For balance, I think the food/buff benefits should be slightly reduced compared to the original fresh version.
---
So nostalgic! Reminded me of how much wonder this game filled me with back in the early days. I remember discovering the mire for the first time and just instantly falling in love with it. Spent literally a month in that region alone just trying to explore everything I could. Built my first CAMP there and haven‚Äôt moved since
---
They give both food and water nourishment with no preparation, up to 35% of each for one. With thru hiker they weigh 0.2, which isn't really that much. Like someone said they can make melon juice which gives a tiny bit of health Regen that lasts for an hour, but it slowly ticks your health up
---
I disabled mine. I was playing like a week or so ago and was doing my dailies, nowhere near my camp and I see someone purchased something from me for 1 cap. I didn't have anything set to that price so I figured that the glitch is back. Checked my stash and didn't notice anything missing but since then I been paranoid.
---
No I do the same thing
---
They all do, I think the odds are 1 in about 90 trys you'll get one. I got one at the lucky pick and watch somebody get one at the Watoga HS. Just be patient I was busy checking my phone for the best place to farm screws and by the time I was ready to return to the game I got my pie.
---
Edit: Just remember to only play if the perfectly preserved pie is on the top shelf. I think after someone wins one it gets reset the next day?
---
If you're having fun still then that's great.
---
I thought you were complaining which is what a lot of people are doing.
---
Bethesda really doesn't care if people keep playing or not, it doesn't have a monthly fee to play like MMOs. Personally I play when new content comes out and then I take a break after I finished it.
---
Hope so but that's something nobody here could possibly answer.
---
Gift horse and all that
---
Actually a terminal does mention them trying to build power armor, they just couldn‚Äôt figure out.
---
Yeah I guess so. If u have fallout first there is a glitch where you can tent-stack to reach your loot but otherwise it‚Äôs inaccessible. Sorry for your loss.
---
I think the whole point of making it online was to hold off those who want a new Fallout by giving them one that will continuously provide content until the next main entry into the series. Of course it had mediocre success but I‚Äôm hoping that it will get better, especially with Expeditions coming.
---
Yes. This is the kind of content i like to see on this sub. Constructive, creative, and downright brilliant. This would add so much more to the game in ways I can‚Äôt imagine
---
The roof of West Tek. Climb up there and grab the perfectly preserved pie sitting up there next to the lawn chair.  Free pie, no machine involved.
---
As for actually getting one from a machine, any of them have the exact same chances.  Higher luck stat, better chance.
---
So PLM works? I avoided mods because I read that particular mod stopped working!
---
Damn I have mine at 30k, but I only have one.
---
That is not the norm. Also other plays can't shoot down your base unless you engage in pvp with them.
---
Mmmmm, canned sweet roll
---
Still there.  Grab it every so often and sell the completely free pie in my vending machine.  Someone always buys it lol.
---
Hmm... I still got to finish the modus quest line but after I‚Äôm done with that I‚Äôll check it out.
---
Oof, that sounds rough. Yeah I don't know how much longer I'll last doing the daily challenges, it's a grind, which isn't exactly what I want out of games, hah.
---
I did the same thing except I was hunting for events and jumped in on a defend workshop event gave a thumbs up to a level 19 he had mutants at the racetrack I literally watched him die once I was in a Chinese stealth I stood up and he started shooting me I waved at him he kept shooting I‚Äôm a level 205 he wasn‚Äôt hurting me but I felt I had to kill him once ,I kinda regretted it cause it was only one shot but I think he needed to know not to attack everyone in sight
---
He was attacking me first.
---
Oooh. Thank you for the tips
---
Either to make up for the missing score points people are having, or it was planned that way to ease up on the fact that the exp per level increase doesn't have a cap and keeps going as you level.
---
I would say this was a rarity. A lot of people will be more likely to show up to your camp and drop goodies or join your team and build some cool shit for you. What platform are you on?
---
ikr, what about these hidden challenges?
---
-5 nukashine blackouts
---
-kill 4 npc settler/raiders
---
-cannibalize 15 npcs
---
[edit: i hope /s]
---
I'll check there!
---
Wow melons are almost a super food. I might need to snag some at the next camp growing them and plant a few.
---
I think they might have been retired. 
---
But then again, they might cycle back in eventually.
---
  **500 x 5mm bullets, 12 stimpacks, and 2 radaways** takes you hours. You are slow sir!
---
Hmm ok thanks. And yes, raiders FTW
---
You sure it wasn't the challenge to buy from a players vendor. I bought 1 bullet for 1 cap at a random players vendor and got my SCORE.
---
IMO the game is much more like a single player game with some MMO features.
---
It should be thought of as something like Fallout 4 that you can play with friends and every 6 months or so it gets new content.
---
Submit a support ticket.
---
~~Shit~~ glitch happens
---
Great idea, but this could be done without another cluttery junk machine taking up space, we have enough of those. Just make craftable cans or jars part of a recipe for the preserved food at a cooking station. The perishable food + crafted can = preserved food.
---
With a decent questline to unlock the recipe, maybe
---
Also was not aware of them not being able to destroy your camp like that. Makes sense though.
---
If your complaining about the servers it‚Äôs not those. Bethesda put out a release date but once it was time to release they needed more time. So they cut corners. Instead of using a newly made engine for multiplayer they used a SINGLEPLAYER game engine and made it barely work how they need it to work. A game engine is basically the back bone of a game and makes everything goes as it‚Äôs supposed to. All the lighting, sounds, NPC‚Äôs and items in the game. They have worked on the engine a bit from the start but it‚Äôs more work than just using a better one that can be used for the game.
---
do not fight back, PVP is a two way street. unless you are wanted or are in a workshop
---
I always wanted my very own canning factory! Seeing the machines go and mash stuff, then move on to the canning etc. there's something.. mesmerizing about it. Also, why not canned human? We already have cannibalism..  
---
I would proudly slap "Soylent Green" above my factory.
---
Take your time, will add you now :)
---
Actually, it might work. Because the smaller plushies you can still sit down with them on a chair, but I tried to sit on my throne with this big chonker on there and it wouldn't let me, so give it a try.
---
Oh theres fatigue now is there? After 2 years of doing the exact same shit? Amazing.
---
Shit players like this are rare and..shit. 
---
If you're on PS4 I'll gladly lend some crops and supplies. I may even have a few plans lying around.
---
Thanks for the response, yeah definitely going to do that. Don't want to miss out on any little bit of score haha.
---
On which platform do you play?
---
I read the title. Looked at the picture for about 3 seconds. Read the description. Then exhaled pretty loudly a few times. Funny stuff.
---
Yes they can not hurt you or your camp unless you fight back. Would highly recommend putting pacifist mode in so you don't accidently trigger pvp
---
I agree with the addition of Purified water. It would create a cooking use for it.
---
Not unless you're doing it in Cranberry Bogs trenches...
---
Hell, I'm a cannibal myself and it pisses me off when I'm trying to jump out, but end up chewing on a scorched.
---
Scrap your crops in build mode and it will let you put them back down.
---
Priapism ftw!!
---
This
---
Pc
---
There is a static spawn of it, no need to sell it at 30k my guy
---
They weigh 2lb without weight reduction perks and spoil without Good With Salt though, so they need some support in that aspect
---
if I was higher level I would have exponentially more doubles.. lol
---
Idk I‚Äôm not a shotgun build but I know that the shotgun perks are in strength
---
You do know that if you scrap a plant it gives one crop and one fertilizer? Never use the repair feature on plants.
---
Good to know. I just typically unequip Lock and Load and re-equip it and it fixes it. However Bethesda still needs to fix Perk Cards just randomly not working.
---
Oh god...  I can hear the ‚Äúschlorp‚Äù of it coming out of the can in a perfect cylinder.
---
I have it in my vendor for 10... second one I‚Äôve gotten. Learned the first. I‚Äôve seen it go for 7-15k on the market subs. If I get another one, I‚Äôll give it to him for free. Too many people bought the commie packs apparently.
---
I have used a qe shotgun in the raids with just the enforcer perk to cripple which worked nicely with a time limit with no perks, but my goal wasn‚Äôt to kill mobs
---
I just assumed it was bc of the weekend and folks likely having more time to play....
---
Everything except the event free stuff has pretty much come back.
---
So the Easter Eggs, the Nukashine kegs and the scorched killing rewards might be the only truly retired items
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 3 months lol. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it when it came out to run around aimlessly without much to do. I‚Äôm also loving the ‚ÄúgO pLaY aNoThEr GaMe‚Äù statements. If other people are fine with signing on to do the same repetitive three things then they can do their thing. I‚Äôm not stopping them lol. 
---
The only thing I have left to grind for is the gauss mini gun and t65 armor.
---
No one asks for any games before their made unless it's sequels. I have that argument. It's absurd.
---
 I sure remember back in the day everyone was just harassing ID for a game where you play a space marine and massacre a bunch of demons....
---
Or when the masses were begging for a game where you played a plumber and murdered turtles by jumping on their back. 
---
Also your list of worst features in mobile games? A cash shop? Cause everything should be free..... Premium currency? Whining about getting free stuff. Time gating? Unlike mobile games , 76's "Time gated" content.... Does. It stop a person from playing the entire core of the game ....
---
Also, no one may gave asked for a BR mode..... Yet, on PS4 I've rarely if ever, not been in a less than full lobby.... So some people enjoy it.
---
Also, the argument of less world depth? 76's setting is full of far more little details, little environmental story telling, and varied regions than any other Fallout game. 
---
And the subscription is optional. Though based on the fact that you fall in the "I deserve things free" camp, you likely see the scrap box as absolutely necessary to play the core of 76..... Which is another hilariously absurd point.
---
Ah, sorry. PS4 here. I‚Äôd help out if I could. I don‚Äôt know of any subreddits specifically for grouping up. But you could try here more, or try r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
"Finally, someone with the guts to help....*puts on shades..Me"
---
WAUGGGHHHHHHHH
---
CSI:Appalachia. Script writes itself.
---
Oof well if you're on pc you're more than welcome to come be my neighbor. Theirs a nice little spot down on the bottom of the hill that I built on. I'm right next to a train station in the low level areas. I'll gladly help you build your camp too. I love camp building.
---
Np
---
After completing the main quests, I found that it became repetitive, and the lack of additional lore is boring.
---
CANNED DOG
---
I wish I could be into it. Just tried buying it again on steam and I can't get behind it, probably going to refund. I love the look and feel of the game, and the story seems interesting. But the more I look into it the more it seems like Bethesda have continually restricted playing the game further and further to make a 1st membership a requirement to enjoy past the early game, and I just can't get behind what feels like a $40 free trial for a $12/month subscription with an overpriced MTX shop that is more than just cosmetics. It's the epitome of cancerous monetization that I really hate, and I can't morally support the game. It feels like the devs made an amazing game and a labor of love, then the monetization team hit it over the head with a sledgehammer, and turned it into an ugly, ham fisted attempt at recurring revenue.
---
Edit: to be clear, if this was a $70 game with no membership (and unlimited storage a default), I would buy it in a heartbeat. If this was a free to play game with a $15-20/month membership, I would strongly consider buying the membership. But both pay to play **and** pay to win is a terrible and scummy tactic, and I find it hard to support this game.
---
I thought weed be done with these fake ads PvP stories after they made it impossible to fight witht he last patch but i guess not
---
Price gouging much? For shame
---
I had this start happening and i logged off immediately and i lucked out as when i rejoinedthere weren't completed.
---
Yeah, like in Animal Crossing, you can do custom designs. This would be a nice way to actually make use of your photos.
---
What about a lvl 120 mothman that spawns by a bridge.
---
All of them.  The payout is calculated by your luck and the number of times you've tried.  I use Awesome Possum bacon and happy go lucky to boost luck and usually get it in less than 20 tries.  Mostly flatwoods because there are possum there to farm.
---
Yes ty! This just happened 2 me. Your tip worked‚ô°
---
If he decided to shoot me after getting to a crate before me I wouldn't have blamed them, but fighting in an unconventional way by not using his clear advantage he had over me to make the game more interesting has my respect.
---
It is cut content, should be in with release, but they didnt manage to get it done like many, many other things.
---
It was intended to be part of a pvp king of the hill content, where a unique pa armor aswell a special gauss rifle would be awarded. 
---
I highly assume that non of the planned content which should be in the base game at release will ever finished and implemented, bethesda is only focused on new content. The stage where they worked on these projects is done for two years now, with new roadmaps they want people to forget about this dead ends. 
---
RIP all these vaults...
---
How did you get to 565 without unyielding armor? That's impressive!
---
Honestly the game isn't much better imo, sure there's more things to do but the grind is fucking horrid.
---
Full health all the way!
---
Hardline with an Ethernet and you need at least a terabyte ssd and preferbly better than a 250mg internet service

I played for 5 hours the other day just server hopping to find a good server with enough high level players to efficiently kill the sbq, and only got around 7 nuke drops, to be fair, there were 3 back to back on one server, everyone was pure awesome too. And helped the level 60 and below players out.
---
Dude, so much hate here... I think you need to take yourself to the Palace of the Winding Path and banish your negative affirmations in any way you see necessary... just be careful not to damage any property! üòÇüëåüßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
So the game has its flaws I'm going to be honest. I probably would've quit awhile ago. The things that keep me going are the players (please use a mic) and camp building. Thise two things alone, I reccomend the game.
---
How does one provide examples of your lack of creativity, beyond the fact that you think something cannot or does not fit into anyone's build.....
---
Especially considering the wildly creative and surprising camp building community in 76.
---
I ended up using the diner flooring and trying to remember what square the edge of the bar was on, remove the bar, place the vendor where the edge is where the bar was and then replace the bar. It‚Äôs very tedious
---
I keep doing them, but the amount of reputation you get is so so small, it‚Äôs a ridiculous grind.
---
Are you agreeing with me in an argumentative tone? I said the playing community can make it fun, you are repeating that like I‚Äôm a fool and it‚Äôs the whole point!
---
As for the game it depends what way you come at it, if it‚Äôs your first fallout game, sure it‚Äôs okay. If you‚Äôve come from Fortnite, yep it offers more. But if you come from the fallout franchise it is a dumbed down version. There‚Äôs grief involved, it‚Äôs not just that it‚Äôs not the game you wanted or expected but that the Franchise you have followed for years has gone down another direction &amp; there will likely not be another ‚Äúreal Fallout‚Äù. Furthermore as the intention is that the current game will expand and there will be no new game release, then if you don‚Äôt like this then Fallout is dead.
---
Fallout was always about escape, adventure, exploring, coming across secrets and Easter eggs. This is a small map in comparison to previous games so not much to explore or adventure. Very few secrets of Easter eggs and it‚Äôs very difficult to escape with players blaring obscene music, shouting ‚Äúcutie bunny‚Äù repeatedly or just general T bagging and general foolery trying to break the monotony.
---
I still play it, we‚Äôre in lock down, I‚Äôve paid for it I‚Äôll use it. But in comparison to other games, including the fallout predecessors, it poorly written, poorly coded, poorly supported (patching etc) and vastly under resourced (server lag, database errors etc). 
---
I can see that a child coming to this can find it fun, but for someone who has invested years of time &amp; money in the franchise this game feels like a death in the family. And it‚Äôs a difficult process to get over.
---
Some days are fun but mostly it‚Äôs a frustrating grind, and when you are carrying the grief the grind hurts all the more. And other people saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs wonderful, you‚Äôre a hater‚Äù feels like you are being gaslighted. 
---
I really couldn‚Äôt give a rat turd about downvotes I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs like someone took the Beatles and turned them into Lady Gaga.

---
Hey there duo. Good to see ya here. And good to see ya giving out fixer plans too. That's real nice of ya.
---
Certain perks are only available after you reach a certain level. Saving is good but you should also pick some perks in the meantime. Hacking and lock picking for instance are universally useful. When you hit 50 you can swap your special points and pick new perks each level still.
---
Not going to lie, I rolled my eyes when you started using "Individualism" and "Collectivism" in quotation marks. Frankly, you can heap as much intellectual psuedoargument and goalpost revitalization as you like, that does not give your opinion more validity (and in ways, can give it less, assuming your purpose in this discussion is to share a hypothetically valid world view to compare its validity to others).
---
Still, it was an interesting debate up to this point, and I thank you for it. Enjoy the game as you see fit, good person.
---
Thankyou for your kind words.
---
and here I thought I was the only one that did that lol
---
Canned razorgrain soup all day.
---
I am wondering the same thing.  I've not returned there since Beckett's quest.
---
You really wanna open that can of worms?
---
I'm 12...
---
wait are you saying i am complaining in what way am i complaining about this i literally just asked a question as to why we are getting more.
---
It is. I finally got max rep today with the raiders. Now just comes the RNG with the Gauss legendary effects. Woooo.  I will not be touching that daily in a while. Thank god. Just the foundation rep to go and I can be done entirely with those dailies.
---
So I should only care about the Special points and swap the useless perks later on?
---
Not needed, I'm 1000 carry weight nonstop with 18 agility and walk faster then people sprinting.
---
Only downside is I can't Ft unless I kill myself.
---
And I'm also a FO1st member
---
&gt; it‚Äôs a ridiculous grind.
---
Yes, it is. And then get ready for the even more incredibly RNG based grind of getting the one primary effect you want and MAYBE a useful secondary effect.
---
I'll be interested to see their response to this. Any normal company would apologise, fixing the bug and say 'Here's 5 free tiers for everyone to make up'. But Bethesda isn't exactly a normal company.
---
The extra dailes are nice but not if the same bug continues to apply to them :/
---
Gauss rifle is already really good unless your half assing a build like 90 percent of the player on here
---
A proper trading system where both parties have to agree.
---
Huntersville, Harpers ferry (don‚Äôt forget the sewers underneath), generals steakhouse, abandoned bog town (really anywhere in the bog), Charleston capitol building, Robco (also good for junk). Just to name a few. Hope that helps, good hunting brother!
---
Also don‚Äôt forget radiation rumble and uranium fever.
---
Pistols good pistols like a 1911, Glock, or desert eagle.
---
I think it more like an mmo then a single players just look at content like gold bullion farming or the new score system 
---
They want players to stick around for months even years... but they need better content  to accomplish this
---
gotta be ready for the when the raiders come
---
I' ve low-key been wanting a bonsai tree for awhile ngl.
---
If they add more placeable trees they should make it so we can clear existing trees from our campsite tho.
---
Some items I can see being canon(houses, walls, etc) but I thought it was treated the same way as anything(even if it does follow the canon) from the CC in fallout 4 and Skyrim.
---
I have all of them for the convenience of not needing starched genes most of the time. I only put on starched genes if I need the rads gone now instead of waiting for sun kissed or if I‚Äôm forced to walk through a rad shower.
---
With class freak I am doing fine.
---
It‚Äôs also the easiest and cheapest way to do it. Just go to a river and spam collect til you have over 100 dirty water. Store all your junk and then spam drinking them from your inventory until you die. If you get a mutation then log off to main menu then log on again (you‚Äôre limited to one new mutation per log in). Every time you die from rads you automatically radaway up to 30% or so of your health bar. Can just repeat spam drinking until your next death/mutation. Keep doing this until you get all the mutations.
---
I would only do this with at least two in class freak and either starched genes or sun kissed to clean off your rads when done.
---
The advantage of getting all mutations is that even if you accidentally lose some mutations you can easily get them back again with this method. 
---
The disadvantage of doing it this way is you don‚Äôt have much choice between carnivore and herbivore. If you get the one you don‚Äôt want you‚Äôll have to hope you can radaway it gone and get the other one next time.
---
My friend and I were so stoked to be able to co-op a fallout game. We quested, sure, but we also spent a lot of time exploring because we knew there would be so much put into the world that wouldn‚Äôt be necessarily marked or even on the map. Yes, the game crashed and had problems, but we had so much fun it easily balanced that out. I always tell people when it launched it was the loneliest game I ever played, because that‚Äôs what it was supposed to be ‚Äî you (and a friend) against a scorched earth. I‚Äôm glad they updated it, but that original feeling of a barren and dead Appalachia I thought was actually very cool. 
---
I love that theme too. I have a tendency to leave games on a menu after backing out so I have some background noise, and 76 and Outer Worlds are two games that were great for that. Now they changed the theme so I don‚Äôt get that as much, but I will listen to my Spotify playlist of Fallout music on the way to work, and repeat the original 76 theme a few times while doing so.
---
"weapons"
---
in addition to the raider daily quests, you can also give mirelurk meat to Blackeye at Ohio River Adventures (left side of map) for extra rep once a day. you can also do the overseer's robot's daily quest where you take pictures. just ask to take pictures of foundation, but then sell them to the Crater's raiders for some rep instead of turning them in to the robot (you will need to comlpete the quest with the robot still so the daily can reset, but you can lie and say the pics were stolen after you sold them, so you can still get his reward for the quest too).
---
Messaged you

With all the bugs it wouldn't surprise me. Is there a reason why typing the password in isn't feasible?

---
Well, there is an exploit to get max raider rep which can be accessed for tutorial online.
---
So if the card says max rank but it still shows up then I have a double. I‚Äôve been doing what you said but I don‚Äôt know how to track if I have a double or not. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve run into that problem since I was a lower level so I just assume I have a bunch of doubles
---
Just put on Pacifist and ignore him.
---
And that is amazing. How the hell do ya do it?
---
Up so much. I don't use glass for anything and I need the metal for my bullets
---
The best idea I‚Äôve seen images, brilliant. Bethesda should definitely take note
---
You will eventually. I'm a day one beta player, took me 2 months to get my first truly good weapon and that was only because my buddy happened across a couple guys duping explosive shotguns. I thought I'd hit the lottery!
---
You're luckier these days than I was back then, the game has been out long enough that there's plenty of good stuff floating around out there. Not to sound old but *back in my day* you never even saw explosive handmades and the Fixer didn't even exist, now there are tons of them around and up for grabs. One tip I'd give you is look at the trading sub and see what people are asking for, it isn't always rare weapon for rare weapon. Get your hands on a Forest Camo Jumpsuit (random drop from doing Forest region events, I got mine from Feed the People) for example and you now have some good trading leverage. Or 5.56, even with the recent ammo duping 5.56 is still valuable, so if you have the time set yourself up with a good stock of lead, steel, and acid, it's like a license to print money even in this economy.
---
May the RNG gods smile upon you.
---
Alaska would be a interesting standalone. Not sure what it would be about though.
---
I'm neutral.  I liked getting Atoms to spend in the shop, and now it feels difficult to buy stuff I actually want.  But I like how a lot of people are playing more as teams to accomplish things.
---
That would be my advice
---
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE LMAO 
---
it‚Äôs not like it mattered tho
---
I actually like the converter. It's better than just trying to sell all the .38 or .44. It's basically free ammo
---
Hopefully this is the case, there needs to be a fine line to where content is enjoyable and possible for majority the players, previously the grind was too much and changing it to be more forgiving is only helping both the player and the developer.
---
Kinda seems like the guy who dumps the card should get the loot no matter what. But hey, I‚Äôm no game designer. üëÄ
---
Because there are a lot of them and they aren't simple little things that could be fixed for qol, they are serious bugs that hamper my experience.
---
lol it‚Äôs what I do sir. You got one right?
---
Always thought something like cods zombie mode would be good for fallout. Endless waves, last as long as you can, each wave gets harder than the last. Maybe a boss every 5 or 10 waves.
---
Okay, thanks to spare some time to advice me guys
---
Yep. And i believe i have you to thank for that as well. So thank you
---
It's not a fake story. I seriously didn't know attacking back would allow them to destroy my camp. I'm still kinda new to the game so I wasn't aware.
---
Aw shucks. If you start an alt let me know I got more than a few to give out
---
I got 6 today compared to 8 yesterday.  None of them auto completed thankfully.  Today is the first set of dailies that doesn't include a level up...at least as far as I can remember.  I would love 8 a day...
---
A more useful ray gun
---
It in big letters on like 5 of the 15 base loading screens it also block your screen with the info when you turn level 5
---
... I really can't argue with that. I *want* to, because if this was any other game, I'd say that adding a weapon is an *extremely* basic functionality, but well this *is* FO76.
---
Love this idea... And love the big red button!!
---
Are you using your lunchboxes because with everything you‚Äôve mentioned I can hit like 60 int. Then I take tasty squirrel stew because carnivore and well rested which gives me +30% total xp I also run inspirational level three. The highest I‚Äôve gotten from the super mutants is like 650ish and I don‚Äôt know what else I can do at this point. I feel like 60 int is pretty good but maybe not.
---
OH so thats why he was chasing me. Sadly i was a lowly lvl 20 back then. Now i wish he shows up when i have my level 999 , 3 perk cards rifle/heavy build.
---
This is how several games I currently play do their battlepasses and it works well. Bethesda doesn't care about your individual experience though, they are thinking 10 steps ahead knowing they wont have any real content for a good long while. How do you get water from a rock? Make the rock do challenges or else they cant get an entire seasons worth of rewards. Its fear of missing out multiplied by 11.
---
ignore them, Probably the raiders just trying to get a reaction. They won't do anything and if they do try to force you into PVP, a bounty hunter will show up and take care of him.
---
Screw Terminals. BIG RED BUTTONS!
---
I‚Äôm sorry but no offense. It‚Äôs 2 years into the game if you can‚Äôt manage your inventory weight correctly please rethink what you‚Äôre doing
---
The Nukes and Dragons site is, IMO, essential before creating a character and at least until level 60. Near the bottom of the page after you've selected your perks and SPECIAL is a level by level suggestion on which perks to take.    
---
You can't save perk points as higher level perks won't show up until you start upgrading your SPECIAL points.    
---
I haven't used a Heavy Gunner build but I don't see it as effective until after you hit 50 and after some levels can respec.
---
There it is! This does indeed make the daily challenge much easier than I thought.
---
I mean i have. But he doesn't have a need for fixers so i don't need one there. But if i need one at some point I'll tell ya.
---
Fixed it for me as well, thanks so much for the tip.
---
reminder that the vendors only give you 90% of your asking price to "maintain a stable econemy", and i have to assume it rounds down unless it's 1cap. did you have something set for 2 caps?
---
Yeah but at least try to be positive
---
That just needs a massive buff.
---
I really really love this concept. I'd even take a 25%-50% hit on the effects of the meat if it meant I could store some of it.
---
Yes, I would use it
---
I have roughly 500 hours in with two characters and I'm just now getting to where there isn't much to do, looking forward to BOS and still grinding the legendary run for that PA prototype. I agree that's alot for a game so i'm very satisfied.
---
Nein
---
It had a level up but you could get your Gold Star one without it and the NW challenges. For level up i rolled a new character as at level 310+ leveling takes a ton of XP. With the new character (Named Levell üòÅ) I'm running through the early missions and stop once i get a level. It has the added benefit of also filling out the early Quest achievements on Steam.
---
I'll help and I need help with this.

PLM works 100%

It stops working with each update which is normal, have to wait for an update of its dependency mod which normally happens within 24 hours of an update. 
---
Update 20 took 12 hours for the update to be released. Get it. Game changer
---
Wow, you just gave me everything I could need bro. Thanks a lot!
---
Agreed. It's not just Appalachia, the most common vessel for canning is technically jars.
---
No respawns is a youtuber. He made the video people referred me to with "the correct math"
---
i like to imagine a janitor or something saw the Liberty Prime designs, and made a crappy replica suit of armor based on it. i say crappy replica cuz it's purely cosmetic.
---
also if you're still bitching about the appalachian BoS, you nees to let it go. the game explains how they exist.
---
More laser weapons as well as fixing how perks affect them. I don't use them as a Stealth Rifleman/Sniper b/c I don't see any change in them.
---
THAT STEAK IS SO OVERCOOKED I CAN USE IT AS ARMOR!
---
Yea it‚Äôs annoying especially with new weapons going around it‚Äôs hard to test
---
The plan was a reward for a treasure hunter event
---
Wait you can use the terminal to find the tourist? That was 2 hours of server hopping wasted...

I've had those glitches but they don't net any xp.

The ones that spawn fine are good but those should have been fixes ages ago.

limited time event reward. unless someone has extras and is selling it, you wont find it anytime soon. it'll come back, though. just a matter of when.

Post in the market sub, someone will sell you one :-)

Trade on the market subs. You may find it in a vendor but it‚Äôll probably be ridiculously priced (base seems to be 6-10k)
---
I‚Äôm up for it when you come online

Wow awesome I've been getting perk swap fatigue so I just leave green thumb and scrapper on all the time. Then in camp I switch in chemist, super duper, ammo smith, fix it good if I need it, weapon artisan if I need it...

Contractor and home defense..

So many things to swap

I‚Äôve gotten down voted because i didn‚Äôt know if you could get faction rep after you do the vault raid with one faction and I said I was gonna max out then before so people down vote for the most stupid things

I shared cannibal once with someone who was melee'ing ghouls in whitespring, he tried to jump backward as he killed one of the ghouls and started snacking on it right as he killed it, then he got eaten by ghouls while he was eating.
---
Weird shit happens around here man
---
It doesn't make it okay, of course. I was referring to your original reply, which I feel was very needlessly aggressive and not a good way to get your criticism across. 
---
The game needs a lot of work still. The grind is there for returning players and it needs balancing. Bugs need fixing. But I think the game is at a state right now where it is completely playable with a mostly uninterrupted experience. The team isn't listening to the community enough which is something that needs work as well.
---
Mason jars would put my thousands of glass scrap to good use! This is a good idea.
---
I pretty sure that was what happened too mine a few days ago. I was playing in the morning to finish the NW quest, quit out and when i logged on to check the dailys they were bugged.
---
I used to have 5 pieces of armor which are deep pocketed and 2 or 3 pieces which also give strength. Then a backpack at lvl50 with the extra carry weight mod and it'll give +120. I also have Marsupial and i think that's it.
---
Now i use Unyielding except for one arm which is chameleon and deep pocketed but the carry weight remains the same. However none of those pieces are deep pocketed and i think 2 of those Unyielding pieces give additional strength as well. So if i wanted to i could deep pocket everything and gain an additional 40 carry weight. Not to mention that i also have strange in numbers for when in team. My base strength is 11 btw
---
From what I've seen it has less to do with Hardware and more just how the game likes your internet connection.
---
I've got 150+ Mbps up/down, and an SSD, but I'm still one of the last people to load in. Issue is I live in Obscuresville, Florida, and I guess 76 just doesn't like how hard it is to find me. Hell, I've loaded in dead a couple times because it took so long.
---
You can't really focus in on your build until after level 50, so don't worry about it at the moment :-)
---
More real world WW2 weapons would be very cool considering they are lore friendly and have been featured in prior games. I would completely work on a rifleman build just to use an instigating M1 Garand. 
---
Not quite new weapons but adding more mods to the lmg, 50mg, auto grenade launcher, and other weapons which may only have one or two mods not including prime receivers.
---
I've had "Good with salt" on my main since start, I always have food/ drink buffs maxed out. My daily run is mostly a shopping trip for the choice ingredients.
---
But a cannery would be brilliant to share a MRE of Seared Venison and Berries with fellow wastelanders.
---
Id like to see a 3 round burst weapon or have the option to change firing options for certain rifle, ex: single shot, burst, or full auto, instead of physically changing the receiver and perk cards.
---
no.
---
i can confirm: just bought t-65 jet pack plans and can craft camo jet and dark matter jet... still in the first third of the run, only one level to go... o.O
---
Making it through that rant grants one an Honorary Toker status.
---
Holiday Gifts have a high drop rate from what I recall. I'm sure there's still folks out there that have thousands hoarded.
---
Other than that, you can do Regional Events for SLIGHT chances of PA plans (Each region rewards different PA).
---
Gauss mini charges the longer you shoot it. It's like an innate furious effect.
---
Anytime on my main character I go solo a paradise event it‚Äôs my absolute favorite (I find the rad stag venison the easiest to collect 50-60 of to get the friendly drathclaw then me and him clear out the enemies pretty easy)
---
Keep doing the daily quests with them. Also, check out the Ohio River Adventures and sell Mirelurk Queen meat to Blackeye. That can be done once a day and gives some boost to reputation.
---
Raider Waster also has a T-60 model base.
---
EDIT: Waster is actually T-45d, my mistake.
---
That's what the gauss mini does.
---
I'll byit for 25 caps bud
---
Meat armor. I like it. Graham would like it, too.
---
Agree
---
New Items and Outfits really aren't a substitute for content
---
If this is the case, that's a great show of goodwill and we need more of that. They obviously want to make adjustments to how they make money on this game with the seasons. Fine, we don't pay for things like Wastelanders, so there's ok.
---
 I'm happy to buy 5-10 levels at the end if it gives incentives to engage with the game in a more reasonable way by adding more opportunities to progress.
---
I wish Bethesda would give us a seperate Pre-Wastelanders world update mode. Not remove the features, but remove the new life. While it adds life to the current game, there is a certain haunting beauty to the ghostly no man's land that Appalachia became.
---
if you're on xbox i can give you an outfit for free
---
I would, if it didn't mean one more person wearing it üò∂
---
No way really ?!?!?
---
It definitely is.  I don't use any sound mods and it's in mine.  Makes me wonder if different versions of the game have a song or two missing/added.
---
Speaking of Grahm... I bought a crossbow plan the other day from him

Why? It is a pretty natural reaction to feel resentment for something that promises over and over again to do better and be better and never changes. I have been playing since the beta and my good will has long been extinguished. You can be positive if you like, but in my mind things only change if people stop spending money or if a significant enough bitch fit is thrown and "staying positive" doesn't do anything except encourage the cycle of poor quality content and bugs to continue especially as far as new players are concerned who Bethesda is relying on for revenue who haven't been burned yet. 
---
There used to be a bug that when entering power armor, your controls would lock and your game would be frozen without being frozen and the only fix was to crash the game and re-launch it. Around that time is when I was in full positive this game is great mode and it took them MONTHS to fix that problem and it was just one of many. Nothing has changed to warrant a new positive outlook. Maybe I should stop playing, but I still enjoy the game in spite of its flaws and have invested heavily both time and monetarily into it and I am entitled to fight the good fight as it were.
---
If you don't like the game and keep hating on it, why play the game?
---
People upvoring this when this story is literally impossible. I swear 90 percent of the people on this forum have no idea how the game even works.
---
I need this for my bar I built.
---
Yeah. I have a couple. Sometimes see them for 100-500 caps in vendors and i pick them up to give to people.
---
GT?
---
Watch its just 2
---
If your lucky occasionally someone might be selling one. Saw one not too long ago for like 500 caps for the outfit and 500 for the hat. I keep the one some random guy gave me and put it on daugueres
---
Nice you should cook him and see how he tastes
---
bruh there‚Äôs no way you don‚Äôt have a second character stop whining about and get it done if you want your ScOrE so bad lmfao
---
Yes that's with 100% bonus from lunchboxes. 60 int is huge, I think I'm running around 40-50. It's the lunchbox bonus that makes the big difference. If they stack on the double xp weekend it will be crazy amounts. 
---
 Fair warning those boxes are glitchy if too many are opened and do nothing even though it says it your pipboy they are.
---
I usually wait till like 7 or 8 pm EST to do mine havent had a problem yet
---
No, I think we all freaked the first time a lvl 100+ was shooting near us.
---
Nukes and Dragons site when making a new or when using your current character. There's an option to see what perks should be taken at every level.    
---
Don't craft stuff until you need it for the most part. You can fill up 800lbs of Stash quick if you're not careful.    
---
Bulking items doesn't always yield a lower weight. Acid bulked actually makes a bit more acid so always do that. Bulked Junk can be sold to vendors not separate scrap.    
---
Take a CHA boosting chem or whatever before you sell/buy to a vender. Extra caps are always a good thing.    
---
Don't hoard. Not all chems are beneficial to every build. Some consumables give other bonuses aside from food/water/HP. Cranberry Juice and Cranberry Relish provide XP boosts.    
---
Don't worry about making an awesome camp for a long time. It's a free travel point so having at minimum a raised bed, Stash, all crafting stations including the Brewery and Fermentor essential. A river is a good place to set up.    
---
Some players like myself have an abundance of things we want to get rid of. I'm not swimming in caps so I'd like to help out fellow players by selling things for cheap. You might find plans and stuff through playing of quests but what's the harm in getting them earlier? I've found a lot of gear mods and sold them for super cheap.    
---
I'm sure 99% of quests which net gear do so according to player level but some have a max level even if you're much higher. I would wait on a lot of those depending on your build. I got a level 50 Perfect Storm after turning it in after 50.    
---
IMO, one should make time for junk runs. Going on missions for XP and gear should be one priority as scrapping gear is how you get mods.    
---
Check the Challenges lists. I've never paid for atoms and have a decent number of stuff from simply playing the game.
---
It'll be nice if they raised how much treasury notes you turn in daily so people can actually collect the stuff they worked so hard to get and raise reputation up for.
---
Wow thanks man... you are a true gentleman and GT is : zacamojo
---
I'm sure it would be fixed right away if you could continusly get xp hitting them
---
All in one sentence, eh.
---
mine is rammadeus. 
---
Camp is near top of the world. if you look in public teams you'll find me in a building team so you can join and travel for free. I'll invite in 2 mins
---
It‚Äôs not to actually use them in a recipe. It‚Äôs to eat them raw with herbivore. Essentially, it‚Äôs canned meat soup stat restoration for free. Three at your camp is enough that you never need to carry food again. Not that it‚Äôll matter soon...
---
I always join if I see the notice. I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing though, I try to kill it asap when it‚Äôs vulnerable, but I always worried that someone might haven‚Äôt had a chance to tag it so I end up being a dick. A couple of times I intentionally only brought it down to half health and waited for others to tag, but then we never had a chance again so the event failed.
---
The economy is broken Becasue of dupes. Basically everything is now worthless. The dupe has been going around for like 3 days now and it Haven‚Äôt been fixed by Bethesda. Now is the time to get weapons your want.
---
Just with fallout 4 I can get almost overwhelmed at the choice of things I can spend hours happily doing. And that is before you start doing any quests.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHrn_pHW2so&amp;t=0m57s
---
Rank 4 version of Master infiltrator is a bypass for level 3 locks and terminals. So the cards are for sure designed with that (along with picklock 3 and hacker 3) in mind
---
Sneak perks are broken again. I have a fixer, 4 shadowed pieces with the sneak legendary, sneak rank 3, escape artist and a chameleon piece yet no matter what I‚Äôm always seen.
---
Saw those in the forum thread, very excellent photos!
---
I've just been doing the daily's every day. I am almost Ally with the raiders and I haven't even broken into the vault yet. lol
---
Well, China tried to invade Alaska right before the great war, since fo76 plays just 25 years or something after I could Imagine that some ghouls there are left. I imagine something like an enclave mission next year or so leading us there. Something like we saw with wastelanders in the underground base with the Chinese spies, but, more on the surface.
---
I wouldnt wear just to finish my collection
---
Ok ok cool that‚Äôs what I thought because when some people popped like three lunchboxes at SBQ I was definitely racking up xp. Yea I heard about that so if you go over four then it just resets back to 25%?
---
I meant cost vs usefulness. To rank it fully only gives you the extra ability to skip the mini game. Not worth levelling compared  to some of the other cards. 
---
More cost effective to keep it lowest rank and just play the mini games. 
---
Still saves 6 perk slots in your main loadout.
---
Ahem...
---
I think they might have been re***tired***. But then again, they might ***cycle*** back in eventually.
---
(Bethesda reads this)
---
Beth1: "So we should..."
---
Beth2: "No armor, no weapons, no perks, nothing!!!"
---
(Players furiously screaming, naked in wasteland punching everything)
---
Lmao. But no I didn't really read it because I thought it'd be a mindless bitchfit
---
Ton more original fallout guns
---
I did similar.
---
I was level 20 and tried to open a door.
---
It said it could be picked so I did.
---
I didn't realise it wasn't allowed and got the bounty.
---
I played for a while without noticing. Then I saw that I couldn't fast travel to any other camps.
---
I decided to sit and wait in flatwoods until I was taken down.
---
I always have them in my vendors.  Got the plan from the Miner Event.  Rarely do they sell and I have them cheap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thankyou ! I‚Äôll add now now and wait for the invite :)
---
It is so silly that we have some gorgeous "new" weapons like the .50 HMG and the MG 42 with little to no weapon mods available to them.
---
What's wrong with nude super mutants?
---
Ah yeah. It‚Äôll definitely be one of the last legendary cards I rank up.
---
I'm joining your game. I'll give you a marine combat armor helmet as well. That was another plan that dropped in that event.
---
Listen here u/p1ckle_smoocher, I don‚Äôt fall in the gimme gimme free stuff camp. I‚Äôm more than willing to pay for actual content. Bethesda has no incentive to provide reasonably priced dlc, let alone quality DLC when they charge $30 for Nuke-world DLC but someone spends $5 on a single outfit. People don‚Äôt need to wait for a new game to be made to ask for stuff, morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3 were all made around the time multiplayer picked up traction. This games multiple currencies are a cancer. Badges, bullion, script... come on. Time gating was done to make up for a lack of content. The small details are cute but it‚Äôs hardly content. They were put there with much less effort. If the games lasting bugs tell you anything, it‚Äôs that for all the money you‚Äôre putting into the game they are not returning the same effort. This game was not released as a beta pre-wastelanders, it was a full-priced AAA title. The only pickle being smooched on this sub is Todd Howard‚Äôs and until we speak up this won‚Äôt change.
---
I don't even do those two events. What's the benefit of those in particular?
---
(spoiled meat) damn
---
Ghoul arm launcher, best armour penetration in the game :-)
---
You can do as many random encounters as u want in a day find a place that has one(google it) do it, server jump do it again, and repeat it gives a real small amount but it helps before i was maxed rep i would do at least 20 of these a day equal to 2 daily tasks good way to get scrap too
---
It‚Äôs really good at a distance but I think it‚Äôs far from ideal up close. It has a pretty small magazine and unless you take the time to charge each shot you can do similar or more DPS with a ballistic rifle.
---
An auto variant would be interesting to see... lower range, lower damage per shot but increased fire rate and ammo capacity. Right now auto rifles are the only ranged weapon class aside from bows that don‚Äôt have a gauss option. Would be cool to see.
---
They probably won‚Äôt be able to credit SCORE points. So instead ask for 150 Atoms per 1000 SCORE lost, to be able to buy the equivalent ranks back.
---
Eso has flavor text for like everything they ever put out in the store and its great lol.
---
Like?
---
üòÖüòÖ thankyou !
---
It definitely is, it‚Äôs easy to hit 3,000 plus point head shots using sneak/adrenaline/gun fu.  I‚Äôve got over 4,500 with my primed Junkies gauss (with an adrenaline gun fu chain).  It‚Äôs super high damage as is, the only adjustments I‚Äôd like to see are about the awful performance in VATS.
---
Yeah but not every weapon is usefule in vats
---
Aside from the T-60 plans, hit player vendors. The gifts and plans were heavily duped so most go for just a few caps now. If you want T-60 plans the best way is the event Distant Thunder. If you complete the optional objective ‚Äútag 6 scorched with a recon scope‚Äù you‚Äôll increase your chances at a plan. Trade doubles for what you need on the market Reddit. I just got my final plan last week. Good luck out there.
---
The outfit or the plan?
---
I play a high charisma build and public teams make it much easier to play when my friends aren't on. I'm loving it.
---
I read that apparently this is an issue if you crafted your underarmor before the update that added the linings.
---
Crafting a new armor was said to be the fix. I don't know as I got the plan when it first came out but never crafted it until the linings were added.
---
No ther is zero reason to make an auto gauss rifle and thats the point it is a sniper rifle considering the earlier models only ever fired one shot should be evidence enough
---
My God you are so stupid with money. 
---
Buying a 200/300 dollar helmet and bitching about it because you "got scammed."
---
Nonono, you WANTED to get scammed. I've met people like you who hoard toys and useless 50 dollar plush toys that cost pennies to make in China, and lash out when we chastise you for being foolish.
---
Don't pretend you didn't buy the 200 dollar thing. Why else are you complaining about it? What is your stake in it? You just wanted to bitch and moan about something you "didn't buy?" 
---
No don't give me that bullshit. You got scammed. I'm glad you got scammed. Haha you got SCAMMED!
---
Ammo. It's why I won't do radiation rumble unless there's like 10 people. The guns I use are awful for ammo and I'm too stubborn to change to anything else.
---
It's under armor.
---
That is good to know!
---
Never had that happen majority are fun people and extremely helpful then you get the occasional ken or karen
---
Makes me wish for a newer Fallout that has San Francisco which has a Chinese enclave(not the Enclave of America) from the Great War that settled there. Would be interesting setting to have a fully rebuilt populated city.
---
Honestly shocked it‚Äôs still in the game
---
One of my friends did this when I was walking him through the quest line.  I was shocked when she started yelling at him and spent some time shamming him, after I could finally breath after laughing hysterically for way longer than I am proud of.
---
There's nothing wrong with diminishing returns if you want it to be one of your specialties
---
I do that all the time just to get into fights lmao
---
With food and thirst having no negatives this would promote eating/drinking and carrying food. also I read it as Canary at first and wanted a bird lol
---
These are amazing! I need that pink PA skin!!!
---
I lost a total of 10.500 SCORE. They will not give atoms back. They don‚Äôt care
---
in the bin where it belongs
---
jk. I'm just not a fan.
---
Same haha
---
Thanks man, worked for me, how did you know this?
---
PLEASE
---
Collect flux and let it turn to inert flux then use that instead of water weighs half of water, carry space is very useful early
---
Just north west of Vault Tech Agriculture center, after you pass the food processor workshop and cross a metal bridge with a bunch of glowing fungus along side of it there is a spot along the river with a junk pile.. it's a bit south of mothman town.
---
You can put a junk extractor ontop of the junk pile.
---
There is glowing fungus, snap reed, and blood leaf plants galore along that river. If you hit the agricultural center and slocom Joe's for firecap you have all of your disease cure ingredients.
---
The Glowing fungus is for radaway. 
---
There is also a settler that'll spawn in next to the location chopping wood here and there. They'll give you two bulk wood.
---
If you follow the river north to mothman town/museum there are 28 guaranteed mothman eggs. They sell for a pretty penny when you convert then to omelettes.
---
I believe it's only 3 or 4 caps at most to fast travel to wayward.
---
(Only problem with this site is alot of people use it, so you will likely have to try multiple servers everytime you log in.)
---
I was referring to providing examples of how it can be used creatively. Saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôve got a load of creative people building camps, they‚Äôll figure it out!‚Äô doesn‚Äôt really count.
---
I would like to see a tesla gun for heavies... tesla minigun maybe.
---
Bethesda website troubleshooting gets you to check both places for the same ini file I noticed after moving it there the game deleted it so the read only status fixes it.
---
I'm currently on lvl 48 of my HG Build, and messed around with the perks on [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) quite a bit before I even started. Because, the HG perks don't start until after lvl 30 it's probably a good time to pick QoL perks and consider a secondary weapon. Shotgun ammo is plentiful, and once you get in to some PA melee becomes a lot of fun. Jut know your build won't be finished before lvl 70-80, depending on the perks you want.
---
Bethesda be like "we'll pass this on to the team"
---
i give people dodgy because i think its funny sometimes when people are unable to run
---
Like this alot
---
They often glitch to invisible anyway...
---
I can give you one, byrdbyrdbyrd23 on PS4, I'll be on today
---
I‚Äôve never played a fallout game and I just got this one for free on game pass, and it‚Äôs been alright but last night some dumb red pawn glitch made me lose a bunch of legendary so I‚Äôm not very happy about it
---
I‚Äôll be on in about 15 if still need, we can knock it out
---
invite sent, IGN michealo
---
Lol it probably be 2 public event inside it own zone which they will slap ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù tag on them..
---
No charge
---
Here‚Äôs the thing I found out about nuke runs on a public team. Each player has to go through the ID process to get in. Had a teammate surge ahead, get mauled by robots, and was giving me angry emotes for not helping him right away. I finally get the ID and rush in, but he tapped out. So I finished the nuke run myself.
---
TL,DR: If your public team is doing a nuke run, stick together or be patient while others catch up.
---
Wastelanders is worth the 5euros you can get the game for . After that not much holding you in unless you like grinding and rng.  Not sure why I keep playing ATM . Guess it's because I got nothing else to play ....
---
Vault 94 Strangler Heart
---
Resets back to 0. People at the event I've just done opened a load and it's screwed up again.
---
Yeah tbh, I'm not really enjoying it that much anyways? I just recently unlocked it cause I thought it would be fun to use and helpful during combat, but it drains AP alot faster than I thought it would, and it doesn't help much when you already have marsupial with strange in numbers. Im thinking of stashing it if theres no way to hide it.
---
IGN Mad_alenas
---
Online now üôÇ
---
Yeah, gonna have to totally agree with you here. Been playing since beta; it's gotten better in a lot of ways but there are still a lot of broken aspects that don't seem like they get the attention they deserve.
---
I play daily and will continue because I love this franchise but "wonderful" is the last word to describe  this game. 
---
Multiplayer making it a better experience? Maybe that was the idea but I'm on the fence with this. In my experience, it's been about 50/50: cool people to game with and total cringy asshats who ruin everything.
---
It may seem significantly better to anyone who dropped out and came back (and in some ways it is) but if you haven't been along for the ride this whole time, you've missed some serious shit that may change your opinion. 
---
Give the returning players some time to get their feet wet and I wouldn't be surprised if their positive attitude changes. 
---
This game makes me feel like an addict; I can't stop playing because I love it but I know it's bad and slowly killing me from the inside.
---
I just server hopped and its invisible now. I guess server hopping on the same character turns it invisible.
---
To be fair I made that exact mistake yesterday as a level 100. I was helping a level 12 take down some super mutants and accidentally interacted with the workshop as I was passing by. Then I think I must have hit the spacebar (or something) by mistake on the confirmation and started claiming it. He had set up so many turrets I couldn't even hang around to apologize as they all turned on me lol.
---
Sometimes shit happens. Can't wait for that "sorry" emoticon though.
---
Sadly I didn't place the tent, it was already placed. It seemed on the right spot but I'll keep playing until I find the event again.
---
Think it‚Äôs just you.. not had any problems on my last character
---
Maybe it doesn't show until you have the quest
---
The Score reqs for each level go up just a bit. It will take more play time and doing more of them to rank up each level.
---
That‚Äôs why I feel like a nuke public team would be a good idea to help everyone kinda work together and have that common goal of launching a nuke.
---
Can I just say "thank you" for showing me that there's actually a button called "enable mods"? So far, it has always been frustrating for me that all Windows Store/Game Pass files are protected. This makes it so much easier!
---
the backpack hides it a little bit
---
You really should think about doing that. The gold grind is not much better. And you get rep for completing the raid too if you didnt know
---
shark pickaxe? must have missed that drop
---
anyway I stand corrected, but there's still a lot of paint for just a few weapons
---
are you level 20?
---
The plans. 
---
The outfit I‚Äôve seen variable prices from 500-10k.
---
Put a gun against his head, pulled your trigger, now he's dead ?
---
well 15 i believe is the lowest
---
I think from the IGN interview, it was suggested that the next season (#2) will be a Brotherhood themed season.
---
Depends on timeframe, actors, and how well they'll approach duping.
---
Three star mirelurk kings.
---
I have a level 50 but I bought a level 10 for my alt. I wouldn't get rid of it.
---
I'd prefer actual content like raids and dungeons to a low effort horde mode.
---
For whatever reason there's a discrepancy in spawn-in times.  Sometimes I load in well before my teammates, sometimes I'm the last to load in.
---
Lol, this could have been me! 
---
I was level 120 when I took Hemlock Holes yesterday. I HATE PVP so I‚Äôm usually a chicken and only claim workshops in a private server. But yesterday I did it on public so I can get the XP boost from my Building Team. Thank God no one challenged me lol because I would have freaked haha.
---
My right arm armour keeps vanishing when I load in. I lost a legendary robot arm, then the sturdy leather I made to replace it. Is this a known bug?
---
That has to be it
---
LOL üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
Thank you! The Pink Sprinkles paint is a Nuclear Winter reward.
---
Thank you very much.
---
Thanks. :)
---
I'm on Xbox! Plz kind sir. I just hopped off because script limit but I can jump back on
---
Lmao everyone already jumping like rabbits pulling Gatling plasmas and Miniguns out their ass. Now you wanna shoot fire out of your ass too? This game is becoming a teenage fart nite dressed in pink mascots rather than a post-nuclear-holocaust world.
---
would make sense honestly with level 100 having the big gift pack ,we don't actually win all that we just shank and rob poor zorbo of his winnings from the last 99 levels
---
Would love to see previous fallout's weapons, such as M1 Garand, Anti-materiel rifle, 12.7mm pistol, Caravan shotgun, H&amp;K G11, Bozar, Holy hand grenade... and just because... the BB gun
---
if you look closer at the shape of it you will notice the Waster is actually based on the T-45. the Scabber is based on T-51 and the Marauder is based on the X-01
---
I have quite a few from Fallout 76 and other Fallout games here:  [https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery)
---
They had a raid that was way harder than Project Paradise. The carebear playerbase threw a tantrum so now we get drip-fed a daily grind.
---
I usually put a lot of points into strength to start and grab a fire axe or something similar ... on my latest character I‚Äôm level 96 and still haven‚Äôt finalized my build.
---
Play, find a style you like get perks you need when you need them and slowly work at your build
---
It'll be cool to see what they do with it. Various armor paints and such. Maybe that vertibird armor isn't atom shop after all? Its probably to get us ready for Steel Dawn
---
There already is an arena, it's part of the Raiders quest line. I don't want a new mode for it but it would be nice if we could return there and fight more stuff since it's only active during that quest.
---
Why the hell would anyone downvote this? It's true, there's literally an arena in one of the quests if you side with the raiders.
---
Hey. I don't play often NW but would be really cool to try to play in team. Maybe i will start to play this mode more. My nickname Assass1n1191
---
Not in this character, but back in beta I joined when I was level 15 (At least I think so)
---
Yeah. But some girls, the ones worth meeting, aren't into gossip. The problem is, they always hang out with the loud mouths because it's their form of security. Like those loudmouths give them confidence. But some grow out of it. 
---
I side with the raiders alot because I've personally fought a lot of backtalkers, and the ones in Crater aren't like that.
---
Nope
---
Yeah I‚Äôd like to have canned tatos but I don‚Äôt wanna wait till next year for it to even be available. From there I have to grind for it...
---
Ah, good catch. Updated, thanks.
---
yea 150 atoms a rank for any you couldn't Get and don't want to grind out levels for , so generous .  At least they added more daily I guess so you literally don't have to do every single daily/weekly and never miss anymore to get to 100.
---
Dogmeat.
---
yeah there is a min level to start the enclave quest, plus you need to finish camp mcclintlock. But thats mainly for finishing the quest line to become a general
---
I never had a problem but I didn‚Äôt buy it until they added the lining being it was useless until then
---
THIS. The Wayward is the worst place for this.
---
I really have no idea what you mean, and I can't even quote anything he says. Ig I just tuned him out üòÇüòÇ
---
Weapons from NV. The Holo rifle, Anti-Material rifle, 9mm pistol &amp; submachine gun, .45 pistol, 12.7mm pistol &amp; submachine gun, That Gun (please!), Light machine gun, original semi-automatic sniper rifle,  10mm shoulder gatling, Service Rifle, The Bozar and so on.
---
The Deliverer from Fallout 4 (I mean, it's already there ffs)
---
The Chinese Pistol.
---
I saw a little silhouetta of a man; scaramouche, he did the fandango (then I killed him for it)
---
Saw someone trying to sell a fixer plan for 30k this morning in a vending machine and was also like "my guy... seriously".  Seems fairly reasonable now lol.
---
Well, kinda. The mouse I have for my computer has macros for my thumb that just happen to be linked to favorites, so I just have one button for the chest piece with the jetpack and another for my normal chest. I can bring the jetpack out whenever I want and hide it just as quickly, but...that‚Äôs really all you can do.
---
I‚Äôll buy a couple outfits from you if your on pc... :) 
---
 ign: BREACH.
---
There isn't a fix in game yet but because you're on PC, there may be some other way of fixing it. I'm not 100% sure though because I know nothing about PCs.
---
Traded the board and the grenade launcher for a BE15 LMG.
---
:( dude as soon as I was finally prepared enough with my build to pull of the 94raid they juuuust announced that they were cancelling it lol, I only suggest this because at least the interior of the vault was is completed so they might as well not waste those assets, I always got slayed when I entered but it was because of my shit character build lol (but I didn‚Äôt complain straight to bethesda and rant online about it lol)
---
yep, still need Raider models/skins for the T-65, T-60, and Ultracite Power armor
---
Pretty sure he means the Red Asylum Outfit.
---
They do care if people are playing it though. The more people who play the more people who buy atoms.
---
These look great. I love the one with the Yaoi Gaui surrounding by the rabid radstags at the end.
---
That's not everything.  
---
I don't want to hand hold you and you should make mistakes and learn but these are some of what I'd like to know going into it.
---
Ok
---
I got an Executioner's Bashing Damage reduced weight fixer. Just a total BLAH. I saw the rifle and flipped, but then read the text and promptly stuck it in my vendor for 1000 caps. Still haven't sold it üò≠
---
yea bloodied build is a god send if nothing else , all that int buff
---
Oof
---
Yea it an option for those who want the cosmetic without waiting 
---
But the way the daily are designed you going to get some score point no matter what you do if your Actively playing the game
---
That could actually shred
---
This game does have bugs, as do many other games, but at least Bethesda made an attempt to fix them to "polish the turd" for Wastelanders. Rather than drone on about what they did wrong, we could at least commend them for reviving a D.O.A game, even with all the backlash and how poorly 76 was received by basically everybody in the gaming community. Things like the Ammo Converter are what the community asked for, but while it sounded good on paper, it was mediocre at best in execution. Personally, I have no issue with it, but I can see the issue. All, if not most, of the Atomic Shop items are cosmetic, and there are good items such as the contemporary CAMP bundle, the Secret Service Backpack, and the list goes on. For Bethesda's first TRUE multiplayer experience, although a buggy mess and poorly received at the beginning, is a fairly good game, and I would dare to say that it is a TRUE Fallout game. Bethesda has came through and added NPCs, a "story", and an endgame, with the promise of more future updates to the game and more story extensions.
---
I think most players are in public teams just to get the buff while doing their own thing.
---
What? It's just a buff/bonus thing, no need to be a snobby min/maxer.
---
It looks like they‚Äôre planning on covering all of the games. Don‚Äôt quite know what they‚Äôll do about duping though HA!
---
Me either but I seen him spawn at one of these things before
---
( I used to have my camp right in the middle of this thing when I was a noob)
---
yea I don't mind the actual cosmetics and stuff even if I have no desire for the ghillie shit or power armor , but 25 gold / lunch boxes/ perk card packs/ scrip ? just have less levels and let me feel I achieved something don't shovel this useless crud at me
---
Try to snipe out the legs, then it can‚Äôt use that annoying beam weapon
---
Are you on Xbox? Been trying to get the flag plan with no luck
---
You know, I never thought much about the PVP aspect of claiming workshops. I always do it for a bit of XP and the junk &amp; plans you get as a reward. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever seen someone contest my claim and I‚Äôm not even convinced he meant to do it. I say don‚Äôt be afraid to claim the workshop because PVP is pretty unlikely. If it happens then just server hop!
---
I disagree, I love the SS jet pack.... once you learn the momentum based physics, feathering,  and have a build that has AP,  you can fly all over the place.  I can't live without it.
---
If your on xbox I'd gladly trade it for a decent junkies commando or lever action
---
its cause the pass is fine and all if they gave something new with it , instead its do same old shit you been doing and ill give you this shiny nickel
---
I said no offense but glad to see you took it wrong :)
---
I miss read sorry

I solo'd the wendigo colossus last night. That is not a thing I *ever* care to do again.
---
I wish, it's ugly... There is a skin for it on the Season board, Captain Cosmos jetpack that looks much better. at least I hope it's a skin and not a skin for the CC PA only.   sigh... There is a SS skin, just don't know if it will also work on the ugly jetpack.
---
If you have good aim you definitely should it‚Äôs really easy once you learn the loot spawn and have your perk cards
---
There‚Äôs a problem with teams.
---
The majority of anything to do in this game doesn‚Äôt need multiple people, and that actually tends to harm things as sharing kills and xp is annoying to say the least.
---
The teams are for a group of friends to play together for an extra boost, and for solos to share perks.
---
It‚Äôs a good system, it just highlights the issues with the game itself.
---
It is very long (over 20 characters)  and contains uppercase, lowercase,symbols and numbers. 
---
It is possible, but if I have to do this every time I want to play the game then it becomes too much of a hassle. I am trying to play this game via Xbox Game Pass so I haven't bought it and at the moment I am veering towards just uninstalling it.
---
Pretty sure they said something at one point about rebalancing and reintroducing the raids, but haven't heard anything since.
---
How much for that plan?
---
Saying no offense doesn't just excuse being condescending. Would you like to me to send you some resources on common courtesy and basic social skills? I'd be happy to help.
---
I can get one shot off before she goes invisible and then shoots with her head laser?  It's red, I die.
---
id say the teams are more from the in game team finder which is amazing compared to the nothing we had. honestly mainly use it for a building team so I can get the +int and ignore everyone else as I do challenges but the event team works too if people are actually doing the events which sometimes happens maybe .. most I join are afk ppl or ppl sitting in their camp
---
Its just a game, if you hate it so much stop playing it
---
Hop between player camps that have alot of plans listed for sale. I'm sure some high level has a copy of it for sale.
---
If you're doing that quest you might want to start looking for all the ingredients you'll need for all the recipes you have to craft. Royal Jelly only spawns in 3 places, and radiated sugarbombs are hit or miss at some locations.
---
 Just have some steel and lead in your inventory along with some food and water(old cans give you steel and lead). I'd just add this mechanic to a cooking station. Now that I think about it I'd just use some glass and steel to create some jars and lids.
---
sb queen event has the best rewards. event rewards gives you stable fluxes, legendary items, x4 tnotes, &amp; chances of improved repair kits. plus the separate legendary item from the queen itself. I've collected like 80+  improved repair kits i didn't know i had. I've only discovered it when i was reorganizing my inventory. encryptid is just exciting to play with other players. lots of players dies on encryptid event. you can only get the plan for, the fixer from this event.
---
With this sub I seriously can't tell if this is supposed to be a joke or if this is just in line with the usual level of stupid complaints.
---
Thank you, you too, and have a pleasant weekend
---
When she was stuck in sky and never came down or moved.
---
Well that‚Äôs the point of MMOs so you should play something more your playstyle. You don‚Äôt have to stay in one game at a time. Take a break and play your other games.
---
Streamers on the subject say that when they report it their issue is resolved so that Bethesda's response to the average player will not be known.
---
Fought one with 6 or so people, we all had decently powered weapons but must have been glitch because the 30 minute clock ran out and we were still on the high side of her regen
---
What platform you on? If your on PS4 I will happily come and Turn that thing into scrap for you
---
The past two days have had 9.....
---
Ey thanks for the help!
---
To this point as well, I have a few low level characters for this purpose alone.
---
I concur. Took me over a month AFTER hitting ally to finally get a bloodied ffr gauss minigun. But it was worth the wait.
---
Can I get one off of you?
---
Does not appear so.

---
It's pretty disappointing tbh. It was a grind, but my team and I perfected our builds and became an elite team smashing all 3 difficulties every day in about 6 weeks or so, and helped train other players to run them also. I was still doing solo runs on Novice just for fun until the day they removed them and still would be now. I think removing content higher skilled players were enjoying was a very bad decision among all the others made by Bethesda.
---
They announced the first 3 seasons on the road map. We know what they'll be up till Spring next year.

---
Fair point lol, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said that I‚Äôm going to claim my remaining four workshops for the Weekly Challenge on a public server. üòÇ I guess I get nervous because I‚Äôve seen some people on the subreddit say that they always PVP for workshops. Once I cancel my Fallout 1st though, what choice will I have? The last time I claimed a workshop without fear was when I stumbled upon Lakeside Cabins during launch. The game was so empty back then that it definitely was not a problem haha.
---
GG thanks you too
---
That happened to me once. I am demo specced and had the MIRV launcher. I tell ya looks like hellfire raining down from the heavens above. Love it
---
i need more things to kill, i recently picked up a nice bloodied double barrel shotgun and west tek, whitesprings, the behemoth, mirelurk queen, sheepsquatch, and the queen just aren‚Äôt cutting it anymore
---
I will give you one for free buddy
---
Ahhh canned corn soup!
---
been playing for over a year. i don't feel the fatigue.  specially now with the legendary run. I'm done with both factions &amp; i love my gauss shotgun.
---
So that‚Äôs saying you don‚Äôt really get any budget increases?
---
I‚Äôve never seen anything, no briefcase, no orange crates, no power armor, no maps at all.
---
I created a post/guide on how to farm for the leg run, might be worth checking out if you struggle :)
---
Have you noticed they do the old Skyrim vanishing act when your crosshair is over them?
---
eh I guess but  a lot of the daily are specific you'll get a small chunk of the score guaranteed no matter what you do 10k xp 100 points/ level 500 points / level 3 times  ... etc but a lot are kill x / y / build x /y  , do events , take x , harvest x/y ,etc
---
Don't get me wrong the daily are not hard and if they doubled the point rewards I wouldn't complain its just that they designed the run in that you had to miss 0 daily or weekly to reach 100 , to make us buy levels cause who isn't going to miss 1 at least over 10 weeks. They did add some more daily in now so there's a bit of leeway but it should never be anywhere near as tight as it was and its still not exactly wide open now
---
TLDR the amount of points you were going to get doing every single daily/weekly over the 10 weeks was exactly what was needed , so you if you missed even 1 day would spend money
---
Bad person? that's the best perk in the game! You are surely doing them a favor.
---
Pretty much this, unless it's an Events team. The shine has pretty much worn off a bit for me. I'm back to questing on Private Worlds.
---
Currently &amp; wondering if this poem is just a collective creation of the entire Fallout 76 community being output by one man.
---
Best part of the fight I had, she was shitting scorched out her ass.  They fell to their death with an angered scream subtitle
---
Good times.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I am on Xbox. üòÜ
---
The servers spool up on demand, just hop until you get a semi decent one
---
Imagine a squad of Brotherhood Knights slowly descending from the sky with the Vertibird armour (cue Ride of the Valkyries).
---
I don't remember ever doing that back in beta tho, A player just fast travelled me there and that was it...weird but ok
---
ü§£ that would have been awesome haha
---
I just eat raw meat and drink the water :P
---
34, haven't played yet today. I only do NW if it's easy, or I have the motivation to play it.
---
Idk most ppl will get those kill x / y or build or even do events 
---
I normal capture a workshop and always do public events/event on my play session since way before the score update . I think most of them are designed to be clear without putting much work 
---
Compare to the old system which I 100% ignored
---
Sorry if this is repeated my comment doesent seem to be showing up:
---
Yeah thats true.  Very hard to work out exactly what is causing it.
---
Yes.
---
Same! It seems no one wants to do that event. I always join it and end up leaving it because no one shows up.
---
"Most fun" is the phrase you're looking for. Funnest isn't a word.
---
Done, good luck and hope we don't have these challenges again!
---
yes, however they cost a lot of rarer resources to build, and then repair if they break
---
Is there a way for Bethesda to optimize textures more to where it doesn‚Äôt take up that much space?
---
Assaultrons at any level are annoying. Power Armor helps a little. Before I got my Gatling Plasma that destroys them in seconds, I would find something I can dodge/hide behind and when it shoots its beam, I popped out and fire then run in circles around what I'm hiding behind. 
---
But what beacons are you talking about? Recruitment Blues you just have to go to Fort Defiance and then Charleston.
---
Already have all the low tier rewards for that event, only rewards still needed requires keeping 2-3 friendly creatures alive for me. All the rewards I got were from doing it solo. Many times. Now I'm wasting ammo unless I go in with a coordinating team.
---
They mention they are removing the hunger/thirst from the game 
---
So In the future it mostly ganna be ignored other then buff
---
I don't think you're meant to find all the ingredients and make all the recipes, just the ones that benefit you. Like cranberry cobbler for the xp and so on
---
looks like you already got it done,  [u/MLK1990](https://www.reddit.com/user/MLK1990/) 
---
thanks for helping me out as well!
---
#At last, a use for all that glass
---
Grenades.  Lots of grenades .
---
Creation engine says no.
---
Probably, I don‚Äôt care. I love seeing new players flooding the map
---
Cannibal was an honest game changer for me. 1 rank of that plus 3 in Lead Belly and you just eat and drink 99% of everything you come across without a second thought. Food and drink is never an issue.
---
That pun was jarringly funny
---
hmm thank you very much I might see if I can just make a bunker for the thing if I can get someone to make it lol
---
Public Teams is an excellent way for players to get xp boosts, and of people share cards then maybe other bonuses too. What it's not very good for is building a team experience at the very time when chasing experience points at the fastest rate possible for Seasons is by far the priority for most.
---
Honestly take the team bonuses but expect no real teamwork. Its not personal and no ones doing anything wrong, its just the wrong time for high levels to slow down and assist newbies.
---
Looks like I‚Äôm creating a new character for this one .. no way I‚Äôm wasting a perk point
---
You are not wrong.  And I also realized I miss counted bc some of them auto-completed and I ignored them moving on with the day.  So, not only am I an idiot and wasn't paying attention, I've also lost more SCORE bc of the auto-complete issue.  Sigh.
---
I was on a particularly laggy server and mid fight the queen started t-posing. It was hilarious, when she landed it was like watching an 'awkward' plane landing. It was hilarious, you had to see it. Suddenly she went from all menacing and intimidating to... well the benny hill theme wouldn't have been out of place.
---
Yes, the plans are still available, but do both sides until you reach the have to choose point :-)
---
Okay, that begs the question, why are they in the game? If you‚Äôre not supposed to make them, why are they there. Also, there are other buffs outside of just xp
---
ü§£
---
Oh man I feel dumb I didn‚Äôt even think about the high tier rewards for the event, if I‚Äôm not mistaken the bear arm plan drops from that right? I usually just keep one animal alive unless someone joins(but they never join lol)
---
I got my ass beaten by two dudes in flatwoods while on a terminal ü§£
---
Thank you very much! Now to see if I have any good friends :P
---
I just died whiting 5 minutes  with a .50cal haha  
---
Maybe i'm a bush wookie at heart. I always get at least 5th place by just hiding naked in a bush
---
Imagine having a event that last for every day the past 150 years, how exhausted everyone must feel.
---
Yea that is interesting. Sometimes ya never know how that fight is gonna go. Keeps ya on your toes!
---
Tons of low level players.  They follow me around and hangout at my camp (which is found close-ish to vault 76).  I actually had like 6 people just hanging at my camp playing instruments, crafting, using the arch, shopping.  Felt lively.
---
I like it.  Also less people one-shoting in events means more xp.
---
Yea ppl join team for the buff and do there own thing 
---
Outside of public events I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt do much.. and at this point it even more hurting since bloodie build seem to be killing everything so no mobs exp ether
---
It is. I played for about 4 months and came back when wastelands dropped. Something changed, stability, Graphics, activities, new game mode. Some thing haven‚Äôt , constant bugs that haven‚Äôt been addressed since launch, persistent dupe glitches, every patch rolls out fixes and returns old issues.
---
I keep mine unlocked. If someone locks it, they don't want to share it lmao.  You can lock it from the build menu if you hover over it.
---
I believe work has been done but tbh there a point of diminishing returns and some items simply cannot be compressed any more without loosing details, and some already complain the textures are too coarse.
---
What was your most fun one
---
I feel you. I went to the audio settings and turned everything down by the same amount except for footsteps and chat. Then you just turn your computer volume up a little bit and the foots steps and tema chat are louder :)  
---
Thanks for the invite! You're on PC? Add me as a friend. My ID: Henri
---
See there's 2 different types of 76 players. 
---
1)The type who powers through content, blinders on, and rushes to the grind. They complain after logging 100+ hours in a game.  As if they got the shaft at 100+ hours for their investment. 
---
2)Players who play Fallout. Who love exploring the more and setting of Fallout games. The stories and setting are as much the game as the quest lines and the grinds. These are players who spent a ton of time exploring the wastes before rushing to the grind. These players have seen more of the game, by far, than group 1.
---
Ghoul Slayer Gamma gun
---
Also had the same with Troubleshooter
---
"We've heard your feedback and we're making it so you can only can 10 items a day as well as making the cannery cost atoms and you need 500 caps for each can you make."
---
All jokes aside, it sounds like an amazing idea but we all know that if its put into the game, they'll find some way to screw it up. Want me some canned intestines or some canned scorchbeast brains. Yum.
---
i play solo and just join building teams for the buffs. sometimes ill join random teams to get free fast travel to their camps for vending.
---
No,  the higher players just got diluted into the many more servers that appeared.
---
4K hours in 76 , wasn't lack of content that has me on a break. My fatigue is from too many times, updates break parts of the game. The incompetence is astonishing.
---
There are people that enjoy the game and also criticize it because they want it to become better. When people hated on the ammo converter it was because it was an awful addition and they wanted it to be better. I feel like you missed the point of it.
---
I definitely feel that, it should just be a badge of honor/skill almost to get some of the specific rewards not just ‚Äúoh you know he‚Äôs dedicated because he‚Äôs grinding every single day for that special item‚Äù
---
I'm 299 and I'm still around. I often give new players chems food, water etc to help them get started!
---
I don‚Äôt think you are doing anything wrong.  Nor do I think your experience is outside the norm.
---
The public teams are an easy way to activate the benefit of perks like Strange in Numbers and to get the benefit of herd mentality and empath serums in addition to any buffs (such as the +INT one from building) that help gain experience.  With the exception of SBQ, Imposter Sheepsquatch, Wendigo Colossus, and Radiation Rumble events there is really nothing a well geared and experienced player needs a group to accomplish.  Heck, even the SBQ is pretty easy to solo if you are so inclined.
---
If you are looking for a more social experience it might be better to look here and on other FO76 forums and Discord servers to find other like minded players.
---
&gt; Or join the game and purposely LET another player kill you, doing this enough may desensitize you from the anxiety.   
---
Well that is a solid bush wookie strategy. Train your hiding skills. If you get caught don't put a serious fight. You can probably get something between 5th-2nd place doing this heh
---
I‚Äôd rather get a pat on the back for accomplishing something challenging not a pat on the back for essentially being addicted to fallout 76 in general lol
---
I'm just there for the extra XP don't crowd My space man.
---
If i recall correctly Serendipity doesn't work in PvP (but i think Mysterious Saver do, but i'm not sure)
---
I'm tracking down Taggerdy.   I think it's the second part of recruitment blues.  I may have a gattling plasma.  I have a sniper build, so I have never used a heavy gun.
---
He‚Äôs cult of the Mothman, what do you expect?
---
Perfect
---
Yet it already happened for a few people. 
---
But you stay negative!
---
I think that was fixed.
---
All for new playable content but let's get the content that already exists fully functional before adding new stuff.
---
I‚Äôm level 150ish and now when I play it‚Äôs grind events, do daily SCORE challenges.  Honestly already getting fatigue.  Don‚Äôt feel like just exploring and such when it feels like I have to grind so much.
---
why? after that you aren't able to increase rep anymore?
---
That's it, isn't it? You tuned your builds, you figured it out, the clock was always a bigger enemy than any of the crap we were fighting, and once you really got it, it more than paid for itself.  
---
By the end, the only thing I couldn't solo on any difficulty was Meltdown, but I had Dead in the Water on Standard and was working towards Washout on it too.  
---
I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt, especially given how the dropped Vault 94 mask somehow got messed up in the transition, that some facet of it made it a pill to import over to the instance tech they're using.  
---
But for months, Vault 94 was my "carrot" as it were, it was why I logged in, it was what my resources were going towards, and it was genuinely fun.  
---
I really hope, either into the Brotherhood stuff we're getting or shortly after, they drop 63, 94, and 96, and make it wicked hard.  
---
Maybe not include "find a million red cards" this time, but in general, make a challenge; require planning, forethought, team work and communication, yes, even failure.  
---
Just something more than "hold still and figure"; something that makes the gear actually feel worth it, instead of just another means to roll over things that haven't been a threat for months anyway.  
---
Man I miss Vault 94.
---
Contractor 2 reduces the materials by 50%
---
I hate PP.  Worst event there is, IMHO. I just wont' do it, unless there are about 6 others already doing it.
---
This is overly complicated. As mentioned, most people use jars, not cans. Second, the act of canning (boiling the foods in a jar for several minutes) sterilizes the jar at the same time, so there's no need for antiseptic.
---
All they need to do is add another recipe for everything that can be canned, and just add a jar and jar lid to the recipe to create a canned version.
---
Carrot + wood + water = carrot soup that spoils over time
---
Carrot + wood + water + jar + lid = canned carrot soup that doesn't expire. 
---
For things like meat that aren't normally canned they could make "salted" or smoked meat recipes that simply require extra wood, salt, and maybe spices.
---
Yes, but you can lose out on stuff if you don't progress both up to that point
---
There is an event at Fort defiance, where you have  to face wave after wave of scorched and scorch beasts might be what your looking for.
---
Hey, would it be possible for me to get one?
---
Good to know. I wonder if i could take on a full-assassin Deathclaw-Gauntlet-Of-Hell with my Heavy Gunner with a normal T-51b and a Light Machinegun. Or maybe a Vampire 25FFR Ultracite Gatling Laser. I know the Vampire UGL makes you immortal in PvE but monster AI is pretty dumb in Fo76.
---
Stealth suit for example
---
Anyone that spends money on anything has a right to complain about what they perceive to be shortcomings. Beggars can't be choosers. But we aren't beggars, we are paying customers.
---
Hell yeah. What‚Äôs ign?
---
You can grind rep through dailies after that but you should progress on both sides until you have to choose to max prechoice rep.
---
It was spitting in our face when they made the Vault 94 armor available for bullion, but especially the mask because we earned ours completing our first Expert run. Then to add insult to injury all our previously crafted armor appears without the vines on it while newly crafted pieces have them. I'm sure they meant the reverse to happen but fucked up and are unable to fix it.
---
Well there's "A colossal problem" coming soon but I agree. This game needs more content in one package than just one by one.
---
I think it is called Line in the Sand? That was my thought too.
---
i did the raid with the raiders, gave half of the raider's gold to the settlers and told them to bite my shiny metal ass if they had any issues. ended up allies with the raiders before the settlers.
---
How can I not be? I submitted a ticket twice, both times they told me there was nothing they could do about it. Where did you here about people getting atoms?
---
FOMO is only a concern to consumer whores who lack even the tiniest sliver of will power. 
---
For the rest of us? We play the game. We get some rewards, we don't get others. 
---
It's only a daily chore because you've made it one. Because some players goal in 76 is getting top tier loot and satisfying their FOMO.
---
For others? The goal in the game is exploring a fallout setting. Exploring interesting player interactions. Role playing. Etc. 
---
I feel fairly confident that the group I'm in gets far more enjoyment from 76 than the other group who lines up at a feeder bar hoping for the best drop.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, do you want a hand?
---
if it gets broken just store it and when you place it again...presto magically repaired. Unless they fixed that particular bug. not sure haven't had to use it in a while.
---
yeah, I'm sitting on about 800 T-notes... even if they only bumped to 300 it would help alot... and maybe offer a 500 for 10k at that purveyor
---
Yes might actually start the SEASON now
---
From people that asked for that as compensation; my brother was one of them. 
---
Try submitting again with that as a compensation request. 
---
Until you‚Äôve **done that and been rejected**, I view your pessimism as pointless.
---
They‚Äôve credited me Atoms for auto-completed challenges in the past, Pre-Legendary Run. That‚Äôs why I suggested it to my brother. 
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm suggesting it to you.
---
B@stards üòÇ
---
Fallout 4 had items that would trigger waves of enemies. I think it was like a siren for raiders, a dead brahmin for animals, and another one for super mutants. 
---
Would love to see something like that given my base defence tends to go to waste
---
On PS4?
---
I was fighting the queen with 2 other guys on a private server and as we see almost about to kill her all of sudden in the corner of my eye was the wendigo colossus showing up at the bunker i think the queen targeted it at some point then it was mayhem with mobs of wendigo were attacking queen mobs. It was so hectic but we managed to kill the queen and the colossal it was the most fun I had fighting the queen and this was before the 10% spawn buff
---
I feel the same way. I'm hoping that things like Rad Rumble requiring teamwork is Bethesda trying to ease players into more challenging content, because nothing else is at this point. The first time one of those damn ghouls put you through a wall you knew about it lol
---
I asked to be compensated twice.
---
Then... I don't know... stop farming Scorched Earth and Encryptid?
---
People are still treating these events like they're the end game of this game... they're just story boss fights that people turned into THE end game events.  If you already have your decon arch and don't need stable flux there's little reason to waste your time and ammo on spawning and  fighting the SBQ and the same goes for Encryptid unless you still don't have the fixer plans yet.
---
If you're doing this shit for the legendary drops then... why?  Even before Wastelanders you were better off server hopping and occasionally finding an event like AWOL up with it's almost guaranteed three star boss and after wastelanders you can trigger Riding Shotgun almost every single server hop for again an almost guaranteed three star.
---
Have you tried the lift? That triggered it maybe a fortnight ago. I ran a friends lvl 5 for the enclave event pops.
---
No. 
---
They're not actively manipulating you. 
---
They're simply feeding you what you need. People act like FOMO was forced upon them. It wasn't. You're the reason you have FOMO and game companies just give you what you want. 
---
It's why you people line up for iPhones.
---
Take the unpopular ones. The way I play is that If someone owns the munitions factory I always try to take it over.
---
I‚Äôve never run into someone owning every workshop though.
---
They grow fast enough that you don't really need to carry them. I have 3 melons at my camp, and I simply pick and eat them every time I'm home. I keep a couple purified water and prewar foods on me in case I let a gauge gets too low and I can't fat travel, but that doesn't happen very often.
---
Such a great concept I hope Bethesda takes
---
Some kind of inspiration of this
---
Pacifist mode isnt supposed to stop you being pvp'd at workshops
---
Workshops are PVP 
---
People can be dicks with griefing, but if you ran back to the workshop thats your own fault
---
People blame game companies for their FOMO.
---
Game companies are simply giving these people what they want. FOMO is a player's fault. It's their consumer whore demanding to be fed.
---
You know what's horribly ironic ? My wife just put ¬£50 onto my PlatStaion wallet  so I could have a couple of months of Fallout 1st and the Raider bundle from Wastelanders...
---
This makes me feel like spending that on a whole other game or two and I've been playing Fallout games regularly for a looong time.
---
You aren‚Äôt being griefed. Workshops are PvP zones. If you don‚Äôt want to PvP then don‚Äôt take them...
---
Same. I use 10mm smgs. I don't have a prayer or enough ammo to do it alone.
---
If I were in a server with enough higher levels, I'd launch the Nuke myself, but as it stands, most of the high level people aren't even doing the other events like Project Paradise or Heart of the Swamp.
---
No, they need to fix all the bugs before adding more bugs with new content.
---
You need to shoot the legs. Even one shot on one leg can be enough. Their legs are very vulnerable. Its not about level. I had trouble too and then I was able to beat it with a low level weapon. Vats on the legs can be good but you can just aim the legs. If a leg is destroyed (which is very easy) the fight becomes trivial. I would almost say the aiming of the legs is a bug. If you can duck around the corner and destroy one leg instead of aiming it's head then you should have no trouble.
---
Sounds about right The Legendary Run has also turned my normal run, gun and fun into something else entirely. Since I'm not a NW fan I farm the 10k XP score weekly and use teams to boost my gains. 
---
Started using herd mentality, share strange in numbers, and launch nukes on the SBQ as often as I can, then Encryptid. Rinse, repeat until my eyeballs can't take it anymore.
---
I'm beginning to wish for the end of seasons...
---
If you are on pc I can craft you one for free. :)
---
Edit: should have read the comments before posting, just saw you are on Xbox ^^
---
Because it's an all or nothing event.  All of the worthwhile rewards are locked behind a perfect run with 3/3 surviving friendlies.  It's hard enough getting people to show up but  then you have to trust them to not dog pile into a single sector and actually farm up and then defend the friendlies without getting bored and wandering off.
---
I used to try doing PP every chance it was up and I'd almost always end up with a situation like  three people collecting sludge, three people watching them collect sludge and then two dead friendlies.
---
Xbox but Thankyou for the offer ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I took preventative measures so a company wouldn't take from me. Bought the service and immediately canceled the auto renew. Nice virtue signaling though. Doesnt work on me. You're sitting on your phone arguing on the internet while people are starving and living in horrible situations.
---
Yes, but I likely will not have another chance to try until tomorrow morning.   I wanted to be able to do it myself, but I don't think I can at my current level. ‚òπ
---
Hopefully. And to the base's general credit, with Public Teams people do seem to be getting it. I honestly think more of the playerbase likes a challenge and difficult content, they're just not as vocal about it.
---
I mean, I'm not most of the time, because it's not worth it for the static. But in those closing days of Vault 94, there were hordes of people not only willing to try, but willing to try again and again until they got it right.
---
Crap though, trying to use the terminals in Engineering and corroded glowing decides to make his presence known? Yep, could not get out of that screen fast enough.
---
I didn't realize until 94 that H is bound to stimpaks, but I sure found out quick and fuckin' used it!
---
I'd love to see a pack of those as a random encounter. That'd scare the hell out of some people.
---
New Vegas Weapons! All of them, but here are my favourites.
---
Pistols: .357 Magnum, .45 Auto, 5.56 mm, 12.7 mm, Plasma Defender, Recharger
---
Rifles: Anti-Material, Brush Gun, Marksman Carbine, Bozar, Trail Carbine. Recharger, Multiplas, LAER, Laser RCW
---
SMG: 9mm, H &amp; H Tools Nail Gun, 12.7 mm
---
Shotguns: Caravan, Lever-Action, Riot 
---
Heavy Weapons: CZ57 Avenger, Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun, Tesla Cannon, Heavy Incinerator
---
Melee: Proton Axe, Thermic Lance, Machete Gladius, Knife Spear
---
Yeah I know that workshop are made to be PvP zones but isn't fair that there's other empty workshops and isn't fun to be killed over and over again and specially just move to other workshop and encounter the same.
---
PvP in workshops can be fun, but not like this at least
---
Got it
---
My brother keeps calling it Never Winter.
---
They're very common now so their not worth much
---
I mean i kinda like it
---
Not when I'm farming tho
---
An option, not a quick option, is to complete Mayor for a Day, &gt;!which will make all the bots in Watoga friendly.!&lt;
---
That's true never thought about it, 
---
but the fact how stupid op explosives are in this mode and the spawn delay when starting a match triggers me more. 
---
But except these two i think the mode is perfectly balanced.
---
There is, but I don‚Äôt know how to go from my ps to reddit, or my phone etc
---
Fair Point, but sometimes i'm helping low levels with defend workshop events and existing another empty workshops nearby (specially in the forest) just to them appear in their workshop and kill them over and over.
---
üòû I should have sold my 1st one I got 2 months ago. I would have made some caps.
---
Sure I‚Äôll just constantly repeat two different events over and over lol. You‚Äôre missing the point.
---
My character survives almost exclusively  on inert Flux and canned dog food, I'm sure he'd do either
---
My guns break the same as normal, it was a pain in the ass trying to get them to break so I could repair them for the challenge because I forgot to take gunsmith off.
---
Agreed! I have literally nothing left to do except for my daily‚Äôs and doing the same missions over and over again gets very tiring.
---
Plus. I have been taking action like I said in my original post. You fail to read. I'm an adult with a computer. I've been having my fun at Bethesda's expense.
---
Not really. I've rolled the exact same weapon (an assault rifle) from the purv three times in a row once. Rng-esus is a fickle creature sometimes.
---
Control Gorge junkyard, has a spot for black titanium. And farm deathclaws
---
Amazing. I'll take it!
---
Yeah, after the treasure hunter event I think most ppl ended up with them
---
Those level requirements to unlock perks, the levels only count if you've spent the perk points already right? For example: a level 30 character won't unlock whatever perk unlocked at that level or any other lower level perk actually if he's just storing points. Am I right?
---
Every time a workshop event comes up lately, every world I go to almost every workshop is already claimed, and half the time you don't know until you arrive because it doesn't tell you on the map anymore, so you HAVE to reclaim them if you aren't on private.
---
PVP isn't that popular overall in this game, but the people who do enjoy it are of course going to absolutely take advantage of people no longer avoiding workshops because they're "forced" to do it. I also believe people will take every shop on a map so they can jump on people trying to take them. But that's not necessarily griefing. IT's a game mechanic.
---
I fast travelled to one the other day and it was showing as unclaimed until I arrived. It wasn't. I decided to sit on the absolute boundary of the workshop area in case the dude decided to come back. He didn't, but someone else did come to try to fight/claim it himself. 
---
I got it whilst watching him jumping about and I claimed it and immediately left. He spotted me and followed me with a trail of explosive .50 cal bullets but as I was already on my way it didn't matter. 
---
Either way the workshop mechanic is what it is. It's a PVP area whether you like it or not and whilst you could argue it's pretty shitty to make that a challenge when most people want nothing to do with PVP, if you want the challenge you gotta do it, get lucky, or use a private world. 
---
That's not griefing, it's just PVP'ers using literally using the only PVP area in the game.
---
Agreed to this comment and OP‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been in love with the series since I picked up FO3, and was shocked at this game and it‚Äôs turnaround. Wish I would‚Äôve started earlier!
---
Oh, that's a shame. I play on PS4 and never have to sign in. I assumed it'd be the same on PC. You could change the password to something shorter or try what the other commenter suggested in that case
---
I've seen guys with over 2k levels before.
---
I always claim the workshop down at the bottom of the map the waste disposal site and never have anyone come down there
---
it has been confirmed a LONG time ago that level does not matter when it comes to camp budget, only bethesda can change how much you are allowed to build
---
With what?  SCORE or Atoms?
---
Log out right before they reset everyday. Log back in after 10 reset and they‚Äôre there for you to do.  A way to avoid the autocomplete.
---
You are absolutely using the word "griefers" incorrectly. You were not griefed, you were "attacked" in  a PVP zone.
---
 Workshops are PVP zones, period.
---
 I hate PVP but I understand it's still part of the game.
---
 Workshops are a waste of time if you are a good scavenger.
---
Might only effect certain weapons then, but I can break my gauss twice in a day if I play a bit longer, before the patch would go literally weeks before it broke
---
Surpise, there is no help. Send a bunch of reports to Beth with pics and maaaaybe they'll toss you some atoms if you're lucky enough to catch their gaze.
---
I may be blind but I dont see anything about the other Seasons themes. I did see that score being earned from public events is still up lol
---
You could hit your 1400 vendor cap limit in 15 minutes
---
I get the same thing. I hate it so much
---
And you're missing the roadmap.  We've already got two potential solutions to endlessly grinding the same events coming this year that may possibly provide a new/actual "end game" experience with more variety with dialy ops and expeditions.
---
Have to learn some how. Might avoid stuff like that if text chat existed.
---
Take a good 30 seconds out of your day and server hop.
---
I farm deathclaws
---
Wrong sub buddy
---
I used that stupid converter once, I would rather farm lead and just not pickup unwanted ammo lol it so annoying, but I would love canning stuff.
---
Oh man that‚Äôs my major issue with it. I never read it as nuclear winter. Allllways nuka world
---
I scrapped mine, waste of camp budget.
---
I would think that level 67 (I think I saw that in one of your posts) should be okay for that quest for the most part.  The first time I did it I was level 40, and the second time I was level 60 cause 2x xp weekends.
---
Is your build okay?  Do you have decent guns and the like?  I only ask because in my experience everyone has at least one build that just capsizes after a bit.  Typically it's their first but it could be due to different playstyles.  My own sniper build fizzled after level 70 when I couldn't keep up with the dps and realised I should have invested more into stealth and crits than I did, and probably should have gotten a lever action (I dislike them due to rarer ammo in fo4 and that sentiment just kind of stayed).  Now I'm a heavy gunner and haven't looked back.
---
Not any more I have 11 plasma grenade plans after someone dropped me 500 large handmade gifts
---
Nope you have me to thank for that üëç
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue currently. Super frustrated because I did it solo and used up a bunch of stimpaks
---
But that's pretty much glitched now
---
Not much, just ask them to dupe it for you
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair.  I‚Äôm not looking to get up in anyone‚Äôs shit, but have heard some go on about these great experiences they‚Äôve had on public teams and would be fun once in awhile to explore w company.
---
Great there go's my complete collection I was selling.
---
Do Breach and Clear event, it spawns in the containers and on the mole miners as miner suit scrap, which breaks down into black titanium scrap. 
---
Naturally also anywhere else mole miners spawn in groups, Uranium fever, blackhole mine in general etc. Soon builds up. You can get it from deathclaws too but it's not as abundant as on mole miners.
---
Can I Ask you how much I should sell large handmade gifts for? I‚Äôve got 3000 of em
---
From a lore perspective I don't think it'd be a thing in post-war WV. With the war against China heating up I bet the country went full "freedom fries" mode on Chinese culture
---
Ha...
---
That Yao guia is so fucked
---
You definitely want tank killer.  I‚Äôd swap out the 3 points in concentrated and just use 1 point there and 3 in tank killer.  Move a point from another special to do so.
---
For AGI I‚Äôd consider at least 1 point in Enforcer as well
---
For strength, you might want to mix and match weight reduction perks.
---
m79 gauss rifle
---
Fear 1, endgame 0.
---
That space is a huge waste of resources. One simple linear mission and now?
---
I murder people all the time mostly for loot and then I tend to go away. I like to fight griefers too but they dont like me since I have tanky sentinel assassin armor with some nice god guns.
---
I do the same with one of my characters but I go out for a while at times and a few melons doesn't really cover, I end up snacking on found food and drink on the go. It's my pistol guy so all my AGI points are tied up and I can't use Thru-Hiker. That eating on the go feature is really useful
---
It‚Äôs just that..... I don‚Äôt know anyone with any masks. Except me with the not-so-rare-anymore raven mask.
---
Not all masks can be duped.
---
Thanks for the info, I'll try to keep that in mind for the next time
---
Everything in them other than the caps are worthless at this point. Just open them and spend the money at people's camps and drop the plans somewhere.
---
I've mainly been playing my heavy gunner in Power Armor, so I can't say how others are affected. Could also be the bug only affects certain people. I've complained about bugs on here before and had people who never experienced it trash me because they've never experienced it so therefore I'm lying or my hardware (that every other game I play works great) is to blame.
---
If you want to have a fun time of killing scorchbeasts when they spawn near your camp, place it in the Cranberry Bog! It can be really annoying to repair your camp because of them, but I have an underground camp so the bulk of it isn‚Äôt effected.
---
So my raven mask might still be rare and worth something?! (I‚Äôm not selling it)
---
question... is there a location where deathclaws spawn regularly? heard there was an island for it... but not sure where on the map it is.
---
Does one no longer spawn on the roof of West-Tek?
---
If you don‚Äôt want to be killed multiple times then don‚Äôt go back in the zone. I don‚Äôt get how that is so hard for you to understand.
---
There is a permanent spawn for PPP on top of the west trek, saves you trying your luck on the machine
---
Wow just wow thanks!
---
My favorite moment was in Engineering too, my friend was yelling for help while he was on the terminal on the opposite side of the room and I was about to get on mine, pulled out the Fat Man and fired a VATS reflex shot, hearing the whistle, explosion and then "Who the fuck was that?! That was awesome!" through the headset was classic lol
---
You ever watched a mirelurk queen just up and book it and never come back.  Just get shot and *neeeeeoooow*. Gone.  They are so much faster than they look.
---
You could take over that workshop, to the right of vault 76. I can‚Äôt remember the name but it‚Äôs a junkyard. In my opinion that takes way to long. 
---
I suggest going to Welch, and killing all the mole miners there. Also by whitespring. If you go to the right from the train station there‚Äôs another place right there that always has mole miners. The junk items they drop can be scrapped into black titanium. And in my opinions it‚Äôs a lot easier and faster to do that, server hop, rinse and repeat. Than just wait for the workshop to give you an ore.
---
To me next probably be military themed. Brotherhood, enclave and what not. Just makes sense since fractured steel will be releasing a couple weeks before the next season starts imo.
---
Thanks going to try
---
Yeah, I'm not going to leave a password to an account saved in a text file. 
---
I think I will just uninstall this.
---
Kill mole miners
---
Wvwn more annoying is when it's a workshop defence and they dissappear (or appear and don't move) outside the radius, and when you kill the last one and get zero reward...Grrr Aaarrgghh!!!
---
What platform?
---
Even before that, they were worthless. They drop from presents, and we all know how many of those there are.
---
Sorry wrong name its fike75
---
I shot a death claw from a roof and he didn‚Äôt run he slid away. As in legs weren‚Äôt moving and his model was frozen and he slid.
---
For some reason I thought I read that next season was vault-tec themed, followed by one tied to the BOS
---
I‚Äôve seen a constant stream of level 2‚Äôs coming out of the vault.
---
I try to stay away, as to not scare them (level 524 currently).
---
Hey u/TheModerateTraveller and u/OneArmedGamer666 can you both Dm your ticket numbers? We'll get this sorted out for you!
---
No one is duping mask....the leggys are worth way more
---
Bloodied. Throw on emergency protocols, stabilized, and adrenal reaction. Boom. You are become death.

---
Pretty sure it still does, not positive tho
---
Hey, my bad, i guess i got some wires crossed or something. I thought you were on Xbox. That's my bad. Sorry.
---
It‚Äôs my use of the phrase IGN. I know. I‚Äôm sorry my man but if you were on PS4, I‚Äôd totally hook you up.
---
I had this issue from time to time. For me, the solution was to select the "Install" option (as if I were installing it) and to select the existing 'Fallout76' folder. That would force the launch to detect the game and resolved the issue. Hopefully that helps you out.
---
I personally like ghouls that stay crouched as they slide towards you like some horror movie stuff.  But yeah, that happens quite often.
---
I've never seen deathclaws do it though.  I feel like this is something I need in my life.
---
Ha that‚Äôs great achievement to be in top five consistently. I should do the same and not rely on luck in containers üëç
---
Ah, that‚Äôs more terrifying
---
Is that offer still available? Im on p4 but id gladly cop that from you for 8K caps üôèüôÉ
---
Funny enough, the place you're looking for is called Deathclaw Island. It's in northwest portion of The Forest. It's the island to the left of the Tyler County Fairgrounds (the ferris wheel) with the little fish
---
I would like a fixer plan please? If possible, I'm on ps4
---
Ign: scotchieb
---
Works fine, if you don't already have 5 characters.
---
And they all hide behind stuff. Like cars or trees. Have you seen a death claw try and hide behind a tree? It‚Äôs hilarious or when it hid behind a chain link fence like buddy I can still shoot you.
---
The only fixes would be;
---
‚Ä¢ Click install and choose the path that the game is currently in. It should verify the current files, maybe download an update or anything missing and be fixed.
---
‚Ä¢ Manually delete the current game files and install from scratch. If you don‚Äôt have the space, make space. You can move stuff to an external HDD if you‚Äôre on a laptop and don‚Äôt want to delete anything, or even compress it. If you‚Äôre on a desktop you can buy a new HDD for cheap, a 5400 RPM 1TB HDD is about $100.
---
One of those should work, if not the first than definitely the second. Is your HDD old? When sectors in a HDD start to fail, installation paths being corrupted is one of the signs.
---
Also try to keep more space free. When you choke your HDD by leaving very little space left, you‚Äôll notice it slow down a fair bit and you‚Äôll have to deal with lots of micromanaging when problems like this come up.
---
Can you see if this solution works for you as well? https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hozme8/fallout_76_gamepass_no_region_ping_fix/
---
What kind of BS is that. I have drives just for games to not eat at my OS drive. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Guess this game is keeping up to its high standards of not working.
---
Same! Sometimes I choose a team with low level players and follow them around. I loot some lvl 5 pipe pistol off the first scorched so I don't one shot them üòÑ
---
But it would be nice to explore with some high level players too. Maybe it's time to use a mic and try to really communicate with teammates.
---
Its all good. You keep doing what you're doing man! Helping people out does nothing but strengthen our community! Hope you have a nice day!
---
Is your offer still available? I've trying to complete encrypted with no luck and i haven't been able to find one for sale by anyone
---
Got 10 of 'em.  Doesn't help.
---
I've got 10 in my stash atm lol
---
Yeah, I play almost entirely solo, and it depleted a lot of my stims and ammo :(
---
I'm on PC but what are the buffs? Where do you get the recipe?
---
Yes. The legendary ammo factory perk will work with ammosmith and super duper.
---
I‚Äôll have to try and see if I can find any updates or try and choose the same download path again, I thought about doing a fresh reinstall but that‚Äôs pretty much my last resort at this point. Even when I do select the correct file path, it says not enough space so I‚Äôm not sure what it wants from me
---
What the hell are those dog-like creatures attacking the yao-gui?
---
It is really hard to mix builds well.  You are can do it but you are going to miss out on damage perks from one side.  My suggestion is to pick one and focus on that.
---
That being said if you are having fun the rock it out!
---
Absolutely! Just add me, I'll be online in less than 30min
---
What console you on? You think your group might be willing to help me complete encrypted? Ive tried like hell to complete this event with no luck, from random players or my friends alike, its just really challenging
---
Yes!! I agree 100%
---
you can talk to him
---
Honestly, I really don‚Äôt like the new wastelanders music. I wish they would let us pick the music we want, honestly.
---
On that note, what happens when I die?  Do I respawn at my camp?  Lose items?
---
I can launch a nuke in like 5 to 10 mins solo.
---
Atoms both times.
---
It left my vendor shortly after my last comment. Sorry mate. If I get another, I‚Äôll message you.
---
Is there any huge difference between rank 1 and rank 3 of the CF? But I don‚Äôt think I need the enforcer as I one shot everything except the SBQ
---
It seems to take a while when you change allies. I just check every time I'm back at my camp.
---
I've been told that masks can't be duped.
---
See that's great! We don't have opportunities like that right now, not really.
---
I was flipping my switches, my buddy was flipping the other, and our third was just trying to keep the mobs down while we worked.
---
Sure enough, he gets overrun 'cause Vault 94 ghouls do not deal in "love taps," so I come barreling in like a damned steam engine to get him back up. Full tilt run, one side of the second floor to other, just knocking them aside like toys.
---
Got him up and we were out of there, but man, there's something satisfying about Pain Training through like a dozen ghouls.
---
The constant rush of "Come on! Fight me!" in there was a thrill all its own.
---
Ahhh hell yeah man, thank you, what's your gamer ID? I won't be on for a few hours sadly, im not at my house right now, im coming home from a family trip but I'll be on tonight, around 9pm eastern time üëçüôè
---
Vats combat inhibitor on back
---
This is a fantastic suggestion! and it makes sense with the survival aspect., either the cans or the jars you find everywhere.
---
It's at the top, byrdbyrdbyrd23
---
That's why I gave it 3 days... for any timers.   It still doesnt' explain why it said I failed the mission, when I never had it (according to PiP)
---
Thats all good man, don't worry about it üôèüôÉ
---
Have you not seen the summer roadmap??
---
This. Us old timers are just getting spread out as the servers get flooded with noobs. It's also made its really hard to find any decent vendors. I've had to turn my machines off because I'm at max caps and can't find anything to spend it on.
---
I guess I have loaded all perks which increase the damage. But how can I improve?
---
The burrows and huntersville
---
The burrows
---
Gramps is bugged. He usually gives you a quest to grab a legendary weapon or to save a kidnapped settler. He's been bugged since the Legendary Run Update..it says the same thing, that the Quest Failed. I like him the best, but his quest doesn't work anymore. He just keeps saying, "Hush, not right now." I didn't use him for 3-4 days and he still doesn't work.
---
Sweet, thanks man, ill add you once i get home üôèüòÅ
---
I haven‚Äôt used the gauss so I‚Äôm just thinking in terms of pellet shotguns.  If you‚Äôre not VAT focused, then it is negligible.  I only use it to target limbs.  I believe it only increases the % odds of consecutive attacks - it doesn‚Äôt effect damage.  But for your Fixer, having that anti armor is much more beneficial than concentrated
---
Lmao hi there. And my mistake. I couldn't remember who it was exactly. I just knew it was one of the people in the chat. So thank you too.
---
The DMV
---
The forest, anywhere with scorched especially morgantown airport and highschool
---
1000 caps says that OP owns MULTIPLE bongs.
---
Wholeheartedly agree, I played on Xbox one and loved it a lot already, then stopped after most missions were done around level 80 or so and I got drawn away to other games. But I remained nostalgic because I really enjoyed the gameplay. I decided to start over on pc with wastelanders. Do not regret it one bit! Almost 120 now!
---
The best experience I ever had was when we were all fighting the queen, and out of nowhere I get slapped and killed by the wendigo colossal. At that point, the queen and the wendigo stopped attacking us and were fighting each other. So now we had glowing wendigos, plus the scorched creatures the queen kept summoning. All 10+ of us players fighting. Then suddenly I see purple enemies show up, with the flatwoods monster controlling them. Everything became extremely laggy. Somebody‚Äôs camp must‚Äôve been nearby because then I see Sofia running around in a bathrobe shooting and fighting along with us. 
---
I have no idea what happened to the flatwood‚Äôs monster. But the wendigo colossal went down. Then  we all focused our attention on the queen again. After what felt like forever, we managed to kill her. 
---
And it was all worth it. Because I got a legendary 3 star rolling pin from the queen, along with a chameleon trapper arm. And also, the wendigo colossal gave me a 2 star instigating pipe rifle.
---
So I guess it still has value?
---
I just launch nukes with my buddies and farm scorched earth ( im lvl 143 btw)
---
Is this offer still on the table?
---
Are there really hidden challenges?
---
Lmao no worries bud can't have that duo muscling in on my good karma now can I ü§£ü§£
---
of course :(   Is there an Ally that gives you a daily legendary but isn't noisy?  I even locked teh wanderer in the Shed, but I can still hear her :(   Starting to feel like the only real beneficial one is the bartender because you can sell things to him.
---
Yeah it was a rush for sure. I was running an unarmed build at the time, so everybody would stir up all the enemies on the way through and I'd come through behind them and have to punch my way through mirelurks to get into the pause room lol. Ever since then Mirelurk Kings haven't been half as scary.
---
This would be perfect for me! However I'll stick with the building groups since you level up much faster mathematically speaking apparently. I play with a teammate who always chooses building for this reason. I've never asked how he came to this conclusion I just listen to it. I personally would rather do the role play or casual.... But I want to level up so building group I go. Man, I can't get over how much I love your idea though!
---
I try to use a shit gun on legendarilys. some times I 1 shot them by mistake.
---
That is correct. For example the second perk card pack I opened had 'Bear Arms' in it, but as it's a lvl 36 card it was locked until then.
---
Dumb question; regarding workshops. How exactly does it work? If you go into the zone, can you be killed? Or do you have to claim the workshop first? Just wondering if I walk through/past one, can I be attacked?
---
Adrenaline is a nice boost.  Although I heard it‚Äôs glitched.  I feel like for your build you‚Äôd be better off going stealth than PA.  I switched from stealth to melee but I still find myself wanting to stealth shotgun everything I see.  Instigating + sneak attack is just so clutch
---
No sorry, I done it with someone. It was a really quick reply. If you put up a post you'll probably get a response within the first 10 minutes
---
As soon as I unlocked the secret service jet pack, I switched my character to female. I put the nukagirl outfit on her. And the jet pack from the outfit and the secret service sorta merge together. And it looks like it belongs on her. So it‚Äôs really cool for appearances. Plus the book bag doesn‚Äôt show.
---
I just sit at white springs for the treasury notes anymore. Script items is too much for me now.
---
Not sure if PlayStation has an equivalence, but Xbox Live automatically uploads screenshots to your profile, and I use the app to look at and save them, then upload them in an Imgur album to post to Reddit.
---
I find that in some places in this game I just get terrible frame drops, whitesprings in particular, I have a 2080 super and play at 1440p and get around 80-100 FPS usually on the highest settings but I think in some places it's just poorly optimized, i can get sudden drops to below 30fps in some areas
---
Unless you actively contest it (ie go to the red bench and activate your claim) you're fine. If you own it and someone else contests it and you go into the zone, you are PVP also.
---
Before p20, all I consumed were raw berries and inert flux.  Now I live on cranberry relish and brain fungus soup.
---
Oh that's just the main allies, they have a 2nd quest with no objectives that is just their questline you can resume whenever. It will say it failed every time you scrap them but will still be there if you place them again. I don't think any of my allies have ever stuck to the "daily" schedule so I've just been treating it as an occasional bonus quest tbh.
---
Don‚Äôt know what to tell you, then. My brother submitted a screen shot and politely asked for either the SCORE to be added or Atoms if SCORE wasn‚Äôt possible. 
---
When I had the issue a few months ago, I submitted  screenshot and politely asked for reinstatement, and the Atoms were added. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure what would be different on your case compared to mine or my brother‚Äôs.
---
Think I‚Äôve got one or two I need to submit... Where do I go to do that?
---
I mean that's literally what a colossal problem is going to address. Like chill, there's stuff coming down the pipeline this summer. There are the community projects, colossal problem, brotherhood quests and events, etc. Calm down and be patient.
---
They are doing a server maintenance right now :)
---
I did want to stealth but I‚Äôm using gauss shotgun and it can‚Äôt stealthüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I was just gonna come here to say the service rifle but you reminded me about how fun the holorifle was to use! 
---
Also what was that dog brain gun in Old World Blues? That one would be sweet
---
PC ):
---
Yeah if I spent years on a perk and it was broken for any amount of time, I would lose my shit.  I'm not engaging with the Legendary perk system unless they make it a ton easier.
---
That‚Äôs great! That alien is creepy
---
Super mutants are your top xp earner so West Tek, Huntersville and Abandoned Bog Town are your best guaranteed spawns. If you can find a super mutants horde event and leave the boss alive you can rake it in.

I made a post a while back asking for this. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/diu7gu/we_need_a_canning_station/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I still love the idea and still really hopeful one day we will get it.

I see! I‚Äôll try it and thank you so much for your comment!

How long does that last bud ? :)
---
u/valseek Are these broken perks being looked into for patch 21?
---
If it‚Äôs damaged but not broken I believe this will work. But if it‚Äôs broken (yellow outline in Build Mode) you can‚Äôt store it at all.
---
It would be awesome if you could use the shoulder mounted machine gun with Power Armor. WAR MACHINE BAYBEE
---
If only being a cannibal had some additional depth to it. Like being able to harvest blood at higher ranks, and the risk of being addicted to human flesh, but in turn, its effects and healing are doubled when you're addicted. 
---
They really should have at least added some dine-and-dash functionality so you could store flesh and use it for some new recipes.
---
Same, I have mostly stable FPS in the wilds, but when visiting cities I get FPS drops at some of their parts. I also have drops when looking at peoples camps for some reason.
---
Looks really great. I didn't know that you could snap those stairs into the middle of a platform!
---
2 of my characters have mobile camps, but I have mine in separate little structures, house, workshop, vendor. 
---
Have you had many issues when you've moved it around?
---
Sad face indeed
---
A while ago, like maybe 7-8 months ago. This kid kept asking me to give him free stuff. Upgrade his weapons. Give him caps. Blah blah blah. Saying he was new and didn‚Äôt have much. So I joined his team. And I told him I would decorate his camp. And drop a bunch of legendary weapons and armor on the floor. But that I was over encumbered and if he could go to Morgantown and pick up a few crops for me. When he left. I placed A LOT of toilets all over his camp. And I just saw his budget go up and eventually get full. I dropped all the spoil meat I had on his bed. Along with a ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äù note. 
---
I left the team and I heard him say ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this‚Äù on area chat. And I left the server.
---
ahhh tahnks... and the Wandered has given me Daily Legendary quests for months, every day... but not that big of a deal... it was just part of my daily grind that I will now adjust... I cant' go back to listening to her.
---
No they aren't.
---
Not seeing you my friend. Find me, duo86m
---
I have 4 of each
---
Then with the response between your post and now mine and the time between. 
---
It should really show how this is something that the community has wanted for a while and still wants today.
---
There's also mod managers that just disable mods for you so you can play nw lol
---
Oh man I hope someone does this on a team I‚Äôm on!
---
True unless the updated one they are making for TES6 can do it. The game itself would have to focus solely on SanFran though.
---
I like this idea a ton! Even if it wasn't an infinite shelf-life, but lasted like 50x  longer or so than other foods, it'd still be worth it imo.
---
Random thought...
---
Do you have the base hazmat suit plan learned?
---
The new one should start doing it too, it just seems to need to "settle in" then once you get it the first time it should be regular after that.
---
This is a wonderful idea.  It's almost like they don't play the game and thus would have no inkling as to the activities players might group up for.
---
Sure! We're on PC primarily, although I believe we have a couple of players on Xbox as well ... feel free to jump in our Discord and we can probably find somebody to help you out ... [invite.gg/TRP](https://invite.gg/TRP) ... we do a lot of event runs, including Encryptid, Project Paradise, SBQ, etc.
---
Being able to harvest blood, or even just drink it on the spot to quench thirst, would be an excellent addition for having 3 ranks of the perk. As it is now you really only need 1 rank.
---
Unless it was making a *mockery* of China...
---
Man you know she just wants to write a song someday that's going to get stuck in your head. She wants to be in a band, really.
---
Once you're used to the ones from 94, the ones in the field seem like a joke. "Oh look at you, with your little poison damage. Aren't you cute? Aaaand he's dead."
---
Same with Cave Cricketts. I used to half fear the bastards 'cause they just would not die in there. Now when I run into'em I just laugh a bit.
---
Still hate Hunters though. 
---
Too much acid splash when I'm trying to pick the Workroom lock.
---
Oh yeah oops üò¨
---
That's interesting - I sell the insurgent and treasure hunter outfits for 76 caps and I sell more of those than anything else
---
Wendigo mutation.
---
I would really like to see a vehicle/corvega/motorcycle theme at some point.
---
hahah... yeah she does, but we need to give them headsets so they can practice in quiet :)
---
Someone hasn‚Äôt been to West Virginia if you think you‚Äôre going to get clean water.
---
What‚Äôs the challenge I‚Äôm not at home right now
---
&gt;That eating on the go feature is really useful 
---
That's also true. There's more than enough plants scattered around that you can usually forage something of your lies on food, or Ralph to the nearest player camp and eat some of their veggies.
---
Yeah Hunters are the worst, I'm always tidying up after a SBQ and there'll be one half a mile away just still sniping me lol
---
Level 37 but a few hundred away from 38.
---
There was also a post made several months before mine saying pretty much the same. They replied to their post as well as mine. I'm sure somewhere there is a Post-It note with our ideas written down on it. Only a matter of time.
---
Good idea. Half of the community will still shit on it to no end though.
---
Dude a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù emote would make it so much easier to avoid unnecessary conflict. The heart emote doesn‚Äôt cut it.
---
Considering the enemies will scale to your level, whether up or down, I‚Äôm assuming NPCs will scale the same
---
I imagine it's the same as reloading. You just stay in vats while you do it.
---
The bumper sword and the prop sword!
---
Here's hoping.
---
you dont have any doubles you can cram together from opening perk packs?
---
you shouldnt have to spend a point to combine 2 cards you already have

You use your words.

Use stimpacks on two teammates
---
So I had this problem and in my case I had it installed on another drive under a folder called 'fallout 76' but the default path was on different drive and importantly the folder name was 'fallout76' (no space) so I renamed the folder to 'fallout76' and clicked install and then changed the path to the where it was installed (in my case e:/games) and instead of downloading it instead went through a verification process (still took an hour to do üôÑ) and when complete the install button changed to a play one.
---
Hope that helps.
---
probably because it's going to be worth closer to 80 caps once the duping is done
---
I did the exact same thing, submitted a ticket asking nicely with a picture for proof and all.
---
I... haven‚Äôt opened a ticket yet... simply stopped playing in the hopes it was some kind of lag. I‚Äôll check and see if it‚Äôs still doing it and open a ticket if it is... standby... and thank you for your attention!
---
Edit: I‚Äôve opened a ticket, texted with an Axel and got told there‚Äôs nothing I can do but wait 72 hours and *maybe* it *might* fix itself, or open a ticket with Steam. Evidently Bethesda doesn‚Äôt help Steam players.
---
Is your Gauss TS by any chance?
---
When you die, anything in your "junk" tab falls out of your inventory into a paper bag on the ground.  You keep your weapons, armor, ammo, aid, etc.   You choose where to respawn.  It is cheaper to respawn either near where you died, or at vault 76.  A little skull and cross bones appears on your map where you died.  Then you may attempt to collect your junk, if you wish.
---
A ‚Äúsorry‚Äù emote and a white flag/‚ÄúI mean you no harm‚Äù emote would go a long way. They have taunt and ‚ÄúPvP?‚Äù so why not the inverse?
---
I just got the Halloween armor so I have the skeleton yet and then the hat and jacket for Christmas
---
I understand your pain
---
Woah Jesus, that's an intimidating wall of text. I agree with you, that's all i said really boils down too. Not reading that because I already agree with you.
---
Maybe some day I'll try, I really want to learn more english. I'm almost lvl 150 but we can play and do daily challenges or just explore. See you in Appalachia ‚ô°
---
Thanks mate! I have a mobile camp with separate structures on another char too. That can also be so very versatile.
---
Well, no not many. Only things that ever happened, happened once and i never ran into them again. Like a wall that replaced itself the other way around. Or the weapon displays on the wall clipping into each other after a move. Once fixed, it never happened on moves anymore.
---
I have TS, Quad, Instigating and also similar gauss pistols, all break at the same rate
---
Just for anybody wondering, the final tiers of the halloween (glowing skeleton outfit) and christmas (fur lined jacket) events both require 14000 exp. If I remember correctly, they unlocked one at a time, so it has to be 14000 exp after the previous unlock, so the total is closer to 25k or something
---
Hmmm, I forgot about that.  I do have concentrated fire, but I never use it.  I think I'll try that, and some better grenades.  Too bad there's no emp grenade.  Or at least I haven't seen any.
---
When I was fairly new, I claimed and built up sunshine meadows with defences. Another new person had joined the server, their camp pretty close to the workshop, and tried to contest it.
---
The missile turrets didn't leave much of his camp standing. Was my favourite pvp battle of all time.
---
Same here. I often load a minute or more after most people. Even when I spawn next to an area with an orange crate or several crates, they'll be empty because someone was able to spawn, run through and grab everything before I was even in the game.
---
Same
---
No doubt: Antimaterial Rifle
---
sweet!
---
That is epic. The player can‚Äôt even be mad about that. The game AI did all of the destruction. lmao
---
Awww damn, im on ps4 üòëüò© i would love some help with project paradise, ive tried doing that event more times than i can count with no luck, that shit ain't easy. But i don't think I'll be able to get help from y'all because im on ps4 and there's no cross platform play ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I bought the fixer plan from another player for 150 caps.its nice to have a lvl 50 fixer.
---
Thanks for the excellent explanation!
---
8 times without the plan is nothing. I can't even count the times I've done that quest and have never gotten the plans. Luckily some awesome person was selling them for a mere 150 caps. Here's hoping that the Purveyor plays nice now and actually gives you one.
---
Totally agree with you, but i think they are trying to add some of that with seasons, so that the whole playerbase can archieve it. But yes we totally need more end game bosses, and loot that only drops from bosses. I would love to see i giant behemoth sized mole rat, or ghoul, or just an even bigger behemoth.
---
I had the same bug today, 100% but i was getting none.
---
Just searched for this, bugged out for me also.
---
Cool! GreyCassette ign here.
---
Will do, also I'll be on tonight
---
Alright calm down satan.
---
Take your time my friend, I believe I have 5-6.
---
so you lose the bonus then? it's time sensitive if I'm not mistaken
---
How do you get the fixer anyway?
---
You don‚Äôt always get a daily legendary I‚Äôve had rescue missions two days now with wanderer
---
Does not matter, you just will have missed out on the  previous points, but some of the first items are pretty good so still worth doing
---
What level are you? (Im LV 10 If you dont mind)
---
It's already like that with Free Range in the Mire. I tried to solo that the other day, not a chance. Maybe if your char is spec'd and perked to one-shot glowing yao guais, you can, but otherwise don't bother.
---
Knowing how Bethesda operates, I'd say it will be exactly as you fear right after the patch, but they'll plan on fixing that with a future update.
---
They might be willing to do it if it was +10 for each bond since there is a perk card(kinda expensive 4 stars), that does +40 carrying weight that would be doing the same thing. Good idea.
---
You're probably passed this already, but with that, I just made a run for the beacons and turned them on. I would usually die but you don't have to listen to them so it worked out lol
---
Log on. See how fast I can do the SCORE dailies. Log off.
---
For the ‚ÄúGain one level‚Äù SCORE challenge, simply create a new character and do the overseer camp/wayward quest which will put you at level three. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Delete character after you‚Äôre done. This is the fastest way I‚Äôve found if you don‚Äôt want to hassle with xp bonuses or extra nonsense.
---
My whole character is built around that perk.
---
I reached the highest level of rep with settlers today and can't be more happy of not needind to complete any more tasks for these incompetent MFs
---
No problem!  My gt on Xbox is melethana, and I usually do have a mic.
---
I've been really wanting to make an actual restaurant camp in game and have a character just be a chef. Having the ability to store the foods indefinitely for sale later would be a dream come true.
---
So please yes.
---
I automatically upgrade when I get double :(
---
And when I had gramps back a while ago he stopped completelygiving any quests I scrapped him
---
Sounds like it could be part of a future cultist DLC.
---
Mole Miner Scrap. Scrap it.
---
Not sure if this is an attempt to bait people into PVP or not.
---
Creation Engine is mess of a Engine tough is very modding friendly.
---
I mean claim unclaimed workshops :)
---
I had it aswel maybe its some servers  require a reboot.
---
I only just came out the vault recently and some guy gave me 28 super stimpaks and another guy gave me a load of level 45 weapons that look cool but I can‚Äôt equip them lol also a suit of power armour I can‚Äôt equip as soon as I came out the vault I saw a level 217 and thought I was about to get mashed up lol thank god you can use different gestures lol he was waving at me and giving me thumbs up haha
---
I‚Äôll be on tonight around 8 pm eastern us time if you wanna do it together. Gt is KingSites1213
---
They changed the icons very recently.   So that workshop up by the carnival on the left side of the map is still there, but the icon is now 3 stacked cars.
---
Want to do it?
---
Ready when you are. Just chilling in the lobby waiting for the invite.
---
True but I'm talking about actively playing rather then camping in a bush since that wouldnt be directly confronting the source of anxiety.  My aim wasnt yielding maximum rank progression but developing players to be able to enjoy NW without having to settle for a passive or uninvolved play style since many enjoy active gameplay but not the anxiety.
---
Are they doing server maintenance? I‚Äôm confused
---
I'm level 122
---
I think in too impatient to wait for the prompt hahaha
---
That also opens you up for PVP. :)
---
Do Lode Baring again. This seems to fix it for some people when it doesn't go away by itself.
---
Someone goofed up with the audio clips - just because it's about evacuating something doesn't mean it should be played at the end of Load Baring when people should evacuate the mine...
---
Bethesda offices are closed on the weekends they'll probably fix it Monday
---
Haha,I guess so, but only for a few seconds. I‚Äôve never been challenged in unclaimed work shops. Plus you can‚Äôt fast travel to unclaimed work shops.
---
I've tested it today (rank 2) on my gauss minigun on some mole miners and there was totally no difference in explosion radius with or without this perk. Demolition expert, on the other hand, works and gives a huge addition to the explosion Hit of the minigun.
---
Four days this has been public for. The second I saw this I thought ‚Äúahhhh this is an easy fix, it‚Äôll be done by tomorrow‚Äù
---
The strength boost for torsos is motion assist servos, IIRC
---
You are opening the social menu as soon as the screen goes black, and escaping out of it, right?
---
&gt; This one involves the social menu and the NPC vendors, right? Quick and  easy fix, disable the social menu while you‚Äôre in the NPC vendor. 
---
It's kind of amazing that it just... you know... isn't to begin with.
---
Why not both?
---
Endgame pistols
---
Probably not it does give you an initial event and then continued events to protect it. And I've never been attacked at a workshop, I know it happens but
---
I know right lmfao
---
This is probably the one instance I like bad UI design.
---
You are correct, I just being dumb cus I always use emergency protocols
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty easy come easy go amount of ammo and stimpacks. I understand you‚Äôre frustrated, but 500 5mm isn‚Äôt anything to cry over.
---
Are you collecting the ore?
---
You're missing the collecting the nuclear ore stuff, the whole point of the event.
---
They are online right now.
---
While individual servers go down for maintenance after so many hours of being on-line, and you can hop onto another server when that happens, that's not relevant to your problem.
---
We need the map to be a bit bigger and add a large city   with new weapons armour and I mean wtf bethesda add better walls and windows like the contemporary bundle. And or let us use wall paper on the outside of walls and add it do wallpaper can go on the roofs. And underside of floors. My home is nice except the roofs and underside of floors. It would improve the game that way.
---
I don‚Äôt even have a weapon worth duping so not everyone is getting in on the fun. lol
---
I wasnt playing when they had the vault raids but I think the new missions the hinted at in the roadmap will alleviate this need. It takes time because they seem more worried about pushing a fallout series on amazon than this game but all good things take time... then when bethesda is involved it takes MORE. I cant wait to hit 100 for the season so I can ease up and get back to my playthrough of witcher 3 for a bit :)
---
well, for me personally. The only thing I've ever got from the Wanderer is legendary hunt. At least in the last 100+ times.
---
Don‚Äôt know what to tell you. You got unlucky. But there‚Äôs no harm in anyone else trying on their own, so maybe don‚Äôt try to discourage them from making the attempt.
---
You‚Äôve got to collect the ore. From what I have seen everyone would rather gain the XP.
---
Every time it is live I go and stand next to pylon 2 ;)
---
I thought that's what the NPC's were doing.. .collecting the stuff, we just had to keep them allive, which we do. ... I'll revisit on next cycle.
---
Especially with the dupe wave, everyone has endgame stuff. Let us use them on something
---
First time doing it, no issues. On my second character play through.....walk through the front door and Dumptruck takes off running upstairs screaming like a banshee. Walk upstairs and Crane is dead and I‚Äôm being blamed. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
Lady, Todd Howard killed Crane. I haven‚Äôt even seen this guy.
---
Visit van Lowe taxidermy and follow the encrypted quest line. You get a Level 30 Fixer before finishing the quest. When you face the imposter sheepsquatch and defeat it you have a chance of getting the plans for it.
---
Yeah it seems to happen a lot more then usual these past few days, so annoying..
---
lol i got mines from a vendor for 100 caps
---
The goal is to collect ore, not just protect the scavengers. 
---
Have people head into the tunnels with hazmat suits or power armor and collect ore; each player can collect at least 40 ore (ten from each tunnel) so either have three people running in the tunnels at once or take turns collecting/defending. Best to turn in all the ore at once to complete the event early, stronger enemies spawn in based on how much ore is turned in.
---
I'd like to say frick the dupe hoarders from the 1st dupe wave but i feel bad for the legit traders/real legacy owners
---
Just so what I did - steal from the dupers lol
---
Or if you don‚Äôt mind exploiting the game that‚Äôs been exploiting you all this time and you‚Äôre on Xbox I could help you get started.
---
The goal is collection - see the line at the bottom of the goals, you have four levels of achievement for how much radioactive material you collect and bring back to the center, while keeping everything alive. Get some radiation/Chinese stealth suits on and run around to the four corners collecting the glowing items on the wall, and you‚Äôll get rewarded based on that.
---
Welp im only like level 25
---
Yeah she was pretty good on that but now I had rescue two days in a row and kill quest a couple times. Rather just have legendary mission
---
People do differnt things.
---
Most cost 5. High capacity costs 8.
---
Do you know how the frames ‚Äúbreak‚Äù? Is there a consistent way to keep these extra stats?
---
Also, is there a good spot to find a ‚Äúgood‚Äù frame? The ones I find don‚Äôt provide the bonuses
---
Down in the caves there's a lot of ore that you have to collect. Very high rads down there as well.
---
 I don't know the exact number but it goes up to rank 4 and the more ore you add the harder the enemies get.
---
 Deposit the ore in the big tank that you are defending.
---
I wish they would dupe more on XBox. I‚Äôm luckily if I find something worth buying from a vendor once a week.
---
I went to defend someone else workshop earlier. I‚Äôm level 338... the owner was level 18. Right after I showed up to help defend, 7 other people (levels between 150 and 300) showed up. We all defended for the new guy and dropped our plans for completion and split. No pvp. No hostility. Just ‚Äúooooh an event!‚Äù
---
Thanks for the Tip :)
---
You seem oddly surprised that something has changed since the beta... almost 2 years ago.
---
I‚Äôm actually enjoying these new *features/content*
---
Yeah, but I thought it was collection the same way Load Bearing is collection...  They aren' exactly clear
---
Hey buddy, this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hp9a5x/psa\_fix\_for\_noregionping\_on\_gamepass/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hp9a5x/psa_fix_for_noregionping_on_gamepass/)  solved it for me.
---
I was thinking of that,  but I haven't gotten close enough yet to even see the beacon!
---
I was a legit legacy owner. I traded for my 2* BE laser and I traded for the 3* one I lost in the vendor glitch. I don‚Äôt give a fuck! If anything I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre easier to get. Having to go through all that pain to get a good weapon is ridiculous.
---
I Haven't played since the beta, came back for wastelanders
---
Dammed....
---
So I finally wanted fixer never got out and only would see it for ridiculous prices. But I found someone on here and paid 5k caps for, next encrypted event what to you know I get the plan lol.
---
Now that we've got some degree of customization for them, it would be great if we could find holotapes in the world that they could play. Or like Raider Punk, you could select a few holotapes that he could play on his radio.
---
It‚Äôs all about collecting, just killing the enemies isn‚Äôt going to win anything.
---
Suppressor and tenderizer are not working either
---
It relies on the sale going through but dropping off server before it registers your side, so using the social menu is how they do that, but you could always just drop the internet connection or close the game to accomplish the same thing, disabling the social menu will not stop it working I doubt
---
Also run feed the people for meat stew and get that cranberry relish going
---
Serendipity is a god send. Blocker is super nice for melee but is also str based, so it's hard to leave other out.
---
I might be able to help you out there. I‚Äôve been stealing from dupers the first 2 days. Got some good stuff.
---
Blocker &amp; Serendipity are a must for Bloodied builds!
---
Nothing is impossible if you have the resolve to get it done ! Make sure to do your dailies and weeklys, and get xp buffs (well rested, food like canned meat stew) to up your exp gain for the repeatable in the weekly tab. you can get that as many times as possible, 10k exp each. you use that to catch up on SCORE
---
hmm bobble heads would be better served random since some to good like the 20% damage increase. i like the idea of the legendary perk that gives you a random bobble head and you can't trade them.
---
nope. back in the early game it used to use your mods before using junk. 
---
that may have been fixed
---
Dodgy perk takes up to 30% less dmg at a cost to your ap. The perk you'll want with bloody build is serendipity in the luck section. At max rank 45% chance to avoid all dmg while under 30% health. It's what makes bloody viable
---
If you are not using power armor, make sure to get Serendipity in Luck.
---
No, but it‚Äôll make it harder. Won‚Äôt stop a determined duper, but disabling the social menu is what they do best - bandaiding the real issue.
---
The limitations of the Creation Engine don‚Äôt allow this but the best way is a unique ID on all legendary items and if the game detects more than one of that ID, all weapons with this ID are permanently deleted from the game,
---
Near grafton station there is a old school with shelves full of all baseball stuff, hats gloves bats balls etc
---
Also if people would repair the turrets, that would be great too. Distracts the ghouls for a bit of time.
---
You need serendipity, ricochet, or both, dodgy won't keep you alive but it'll eat up your ap.
---
are you under level 20?
---
It's from the past game fallout new vegas but there is made mores sense since you could argue it was like a manual that only applied to a single skill.
---
You‚Äôre not missing anything. Anytime you scrap the settler it says you fail a mission he never gave you. I prefer the raider punk personally. He gets more dialogue the more missions you complete and he‚Äôs funny as hell. Occasionally he‚Äôll bug and not give you a quest, which can usually be fixed by storing him, server hopping and replacing him.
---
On your perks do you use blocker? I use to have a big problem with this and that helped me big time. That, iron clad and barbarian.
---
I think the real question is Can they make it happen.
---
You can find them again where you found them the first time. Check fo76map.com and you can filter to just see collectible locations. If they‚Äôre not there, then that means someone in the world already got them. Hop worlds and look again! Easy peasy.
---
Serendipity blocker barbarian and I like adimantium skeleton for my melee build. Also uny ss armor helps
---
Tank killer would only work for the fixer rifle right?
---
Lol. That the one. I called it Dodgy
---
I do flamingos or cat paintings, but only if they don't already have any.
---
Maybe not but at the very least there was a sense of accomplishment, not dread for having to deal with ward again. And, if say broken steel was a good execution of an endgame to a degree.
---
But wth the score gring its kinda better to let the event go as long as you can then turn in once the timer gets close.
---
I got one from the Rusty Pick machine, couldn't believe it!
---
Everyone is of course free to play the way they want, but your two-types-of-players writeup is both a false dichotomy and strangely indulgent on that #2 player type. 
---
&gt; The stories and setting are as much the game as the quest lines and the grinds. 
---
While Appalachia is a great and large map, the idea that walking around a map, reading a few notes or terminals per location, is the type of content that keeps the average player engaged for 100+ hours of this game is absurd. Again, it might keep you and some others engaged, but to me and most other gamers I'd say that the endgame content of Fallout 76 should be more than merely walking around a mostly-explored map looking for that one note I didnt find before. 
---
The people in my corner, the *more endgame content* corner, really arent asking for much when we ask for new repeatable gameplay events/raids/etc. Example: I'm playing Halo 5 right now, I've played it for 5 years and 750 hours - despite its maps utterly paling in comparison to the size or density of Fo76's, Halo 5's game modes and small offerings of maps actually offer way more replayability via tight and varied gameplay. It's simple, fun, and **challenging**. Fallout 76 needs some raids that feel like a fun, challenging event that you want to replay. The Scorchbeast Queen is an easy ass fight for me and I just started my 76 account with Wastelanders. I truly feel for the players like me who have tried to play this game for 2 years - there's essentially nothing to do besides the few challenging events and half of those arent challenging. *Plus*, only Encryptid and SBQ can actually be triggered at will which makes it worse. 
---
A game like Minecraft can keep you engaged with little "content" because it simultaneously has a fun progression loop to diamonds/enchanted and the building is so open to fun projects. Fallout 76 has a good gameplay loop for about 90 levels but after that it requires new content, and the reason why is this:
---
* Limited options with the CAMP system compared to other survival crafters like Minecraft, Ark, 7 days to Die which have way fewer constraints
---
* Only a four challenging replayable events, half of which you cant even trigger on your own and the other half involve the SBQ fight we've all done a million times and Encryptid which while interesting doesnt offer much in variation. 
---
* The replayable events don't have very good maps (Encryptid and SBQ) and they wouldnt *ever* pass in any other game based on replayable PvE content. There is zero verticality (unless you count people standing on top of the little building, lol) or horizontal variation.
---
My quest fixed itself after a few days. Shouldn't be a huge issue.
---
How much do you need? PM me your GT and tell me what you need to finish the PA and I'll just give it to you.
---
Same thing happened when wastelanders came out. Before there was nothing but high level players and a nuke every server. But when the dlc came out nothing for weeks. Then it started to pick up again but yes now I am on a server with a bunch oh low levels and no nukes and their vendors with say 50 weapons and only be regular guns being you can‚Äôt tell a players level from going to their camp
---
I see your also a man of culture when it comes to mobile games
---
I had a level 50 come up to me (106) and start shooting me and bashing me with his gun. I‚Äôm like dude why are you trying to pvp with someone who‚Äôs a much higher level than you??
---
Thank you! Means a lot.
---
I‚Äôll have to unlock adimantium but have full
---
Blocker
---
Sure you can have Int that high but it hard caps at 25 any over 25 gives no extra exp and you can only stack 1 bobble, sleeping and 1 food item without exploits
---
And I a bloodied cammando full unyielding with 25 int (50%) using squirrel stew (20%with carnivores mutation) sleep (5%) and I get about 500 to 700 per super mutant and I've grinded everyday since day 1 and done every daily and weekly and I'm almost to 40 
---
Theres absolutely no way anyone could be at 100 legitimately
---
?
---
No. The name is only seen by you.
---
yesss, then offer a legendary perk to give you let's say 4 in total.  
---
Some are no brainers like increase damage for scoped or not scoped weapons but some are very niche like 25% more damage with the alien blaster which would make it  pretty good if you could get two shot modifier or bloodied.
---
Im just happy this one is kinda reliant on laggyness. It might give them a reason to focus on smoothening the game out.
---
Ricochet?
---
No. Renames are for the owner only
---
Lucky! I'll get that pie yet! I went to West tech but someone was already there. They did the moth man dance and fast traveled away. I couldn't even be mad
---
nude super-mutants are funny tho just casually rubbing their head..minding their own business you know
---
I have to think the only thing propping this game up is the plague keeping everyone at home and the resulting lack of things to do. Once people have more options the lack of customer service isn't going to fly. Which is a problem for all of us, since the health of the game decides what resources are going to be thrown at it. I really hope they make some strides strengthening the player base before cyberpunk 2020 hits, because that's liable to be a big hit just by itself.
---
It really hasn't been a grind at all for me. I usually hop on for a couple hours every day, time permitting, and these rep dailies only take maybe 30 minutes or less to complete. Then I just hop around the map doing all the dailies that activate and finally just start running the usual places for XP and legendaries until I get bored and do it over the next day. The rep has just kinda been something that's been leveling up for me in the background and has not been my focus. 
---
Eventually I'll crack open that vault but to be honest there isn't anything inside that interests me much since I'm already geared exactly how what I want.
---
Ugh...wish there was a way to see how much xp I have. I know I‚Äôm getting close but the not knowing is killing me
---
Is the BP pistol bloodied? If not, there's a visual bug where the weapon damage you're looking at reflects what it would be with bloodied damage. When you equip it, it reverts to showing the actual damage.
---
Honestly don't know.
---
I'm level 201 and I've never had my items from display or vendor used as scrap. Dumb question, have checked your scrap box? One thing that happened to me a while back, which I found hilarious, the spinning magazine rack would sometimes drop magazines onto the floor. I have no idea how. When I checked the stash they were still listed as on display. So I had to disable then reenable.
---
ETA: If you move camp and start building before putting displays up that could be the point when they are still in stash and can be junked.
---
Explosive shotguns and enforcer rank 3 make mincemeat of this event
---
Down all the ghouls but dont kill them
---
Then make sure between everyone there you have 100 ore necessary. Dump it in the machine all at once
---
Profit
---
I like that from a role playing perspective.   
---
"I am the honorable Vault Dweller, champion of the Wasteland and her people"   
---
"Wow, really cool man, love that. Heeeey what's that?"   
---
"That is a field of Vanquished Ghouls that was attacking the Hamlet"   
---
"Aw bummer, but at least they're dead. Hey, you hungry? You look a little beat up after that fight."   
---
"Yes, I suppose we should partake of our rations and keep our str-"   
---
"-Yeah Yeah, hey... eat the ghouls."   
---
"W-What?"   
---
"Yeah, go eat them"   
---
"That is vile! I will not sup on the flesh of mine enemies, especially not my UNDEAD enemies"   
---
"Yeah but..." \*CHARISMA +7 "Eat them."   
---
"Well okay then."   
---
\*SNACK SLRP SNARL\*
---
I‚Äôve seen people make it work on a normal, as close to lag free as you can get server.
---
A full set of Secret Service gear made such huge difference for me, I had nice uny gear from drop but that SS really does the job. Serendipity and blocker are also must haves. Healing factor mutation keeps my health up and also gave me the little extra tankiness I wanted.
---
It's been changing on a daily (or more often) basis ever since patch 20. Sometimes the icon is a unique icon for the workshop, Mount Blair for example looks great and sometimes it's a standard workshop icon.
---
The problem is the unique icons indicate you can fast travel to them (you can't) and it fails to show what resources are available. Beth needs to make up their mind, preferably intermixing the two ideas.
---
What is your psn? Next time our group does it I can add you. I am Cyborg-mom ps4.
---
You have to collect at least 25 ore to make it to tier 1.
---
It's a dual objective event. Protect all 4 NPC's, and collect 100 ore. The event ends when you get to 100.
---
Edit: If you're coordinating with a team, hold the ore until the last 30 sec or so. Every 25 ore, it releases a large wave of mobs.

Friday I had the ammo factory claimed and someone contested it I'm 91 they were in 90s as well they killed me once I killed them after and then they left alone first time I did pvp
---
It‚Äôs already mid-July lmao. Summers almost gone. How many times has things been pushed back? Wendigo?
---
Good to hear
---
How do you steal from dupers?
---
I want to know if anyone has tried putting a wedding ring on the super mutant, that should put the clothes back on.
---
No I leveled up earlier today to 30 and that's when I realized that a few of the dailys were missing
---
And here I thought my picture of a dead radtoad was good. Man you are a god at capturing the essence of fallout through a photograph.
---
Dude; don't compare them to people with autism....
---
*relaxo1979 has been removed from the team*

Legendary Cannibal perk for dine and dash and extracting blood packs. Would synergize with Cannibal and that one that buffs blood packs. I'd get that just for the RP value. Have it proc like Butcher's Bounty and add Strange Meat and or Blood packs to corpses you snack on after you press Y. We just have to come up with a couple other bonuses for four ranks and it's good to go.
---
Best: SS Chestpiece w/ Jetpack. It changes gameplay for non-PA players and has a staggering amount of Defense.  
---
Worst: Gotta give it to Water Well. A slow animation to obtain 1 dirty water when i can spam R and get 20 of them for cooking. I like the aesthetic but if I wanted to take forever to get dirty water I'd use the Clean Sink.
---
Yes.  And when you get the unique pistol, sword, and outfit from that quest line, if you like them DO NOT sell or scrap them.  The crafting recipes for them REQUIRE the base version to "upgrade" them to a higher level.
---
And the game doesn't ever allow you to get these things again, because of the usual Bethesda design philosophy.

odd. yesterday i had the level up challenge on my level 23. and someone said it had been removed for lower levels.
---
Yeah, I dont' like what they did.  They no longer indicate where the workshops are unless they are captured.  What a dumb decision.   As the other poster noted, some were replaced with a blue icon, so they no longer stand out and you have to guess if there is a workshop. VERY DUMB idea that hampers new people that dont' have the locations memorized.
---
I'll be honest, it was getting a vegetarian (my friend) to eat a carcass that made it so funny to me in the first place but this is just as good. The noble vault dweller tries to jump too close to a dead ghoul and ends up munching away on it, lol.
---
No, French using Google translate.
---
For some reason those bastards use up a fair amount of CAMP build points, I had to remove them one by one and eventually just tossed the whole display to build other things I needed for my CAMP.
---
As for your question, I think you just have to find again, many wind up becoming pretty common. The lock pick one I‚Äôve found half a dozen of already. Lots of folks sell their duplicates as well and sometimes not very expensive.
---
Speaking of Nuka World it's a damn shame they haven't added most of the stuff from it yet. I would kill for some Pack armor and that ghoul chair
---
Must be intermittent. I stacked 4 today for 100%.
---
hasn't since last update
---
There is a backpack mod from the Possum scouts that increases duration and a perk in Luck called Good with Salt which reduces decay by 90%. So if you have Agi points to spare and not Luck you can always get Thru Hiker and the Possum backpack.
---
Theres a dupe going on ?
---
The Gourmands
---
Ive noticed my build is sorta tanky compared to other bloodied but I still can get up to 3k dgm. I use barbarian and evasive and max out STR + AGI, then consider life giver or the other END perk that gives unarmored resistance. Since you have so little life it's pretty importiant to try getting that max hp up if possible, but I think dmg resist is better.
---
Using vats helps me tear down groups of ghouls since it will teleport you a small distance you can strike first and it will place you a way behind the group if you were running. Also if you have marsupial super fun to jump and land on ppl with a vats hit.
---
Blocker is also pretty importiant if its groups meleeing you to death.
---
Strong suggestion, go unarmed with a DCG. Unarmed and gladiator dmg perks stack and you get two mutations that both buff the dmg.  Class freak and stranger in numbers advised.  Feel free to ask any questions I've had my bloodied build planned and in process since the pre beta stress test.
---
I would play with the nukes and dragons build planner it's great (sorry if your the same guy I advised this to earlier, if so I'm glad you liked it).
---
I think its residual elements of the rust style game they tried to make.
---
There is made a little more sense since pvp in their heads would be so much more intense so these buffs would be that much more important.
---
Especially when you look at some magazines like  "#10 Nightmare in the Garden: +50% workshop turret damage"
---
people usually sell them for 100 caps or less
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt give you 20 dirty water at a time with the water well.  It‚Äôs hardly broken.  You can‚Äôt sell it.  But it might help when you are away from bodies of water and want boiled water.
---
Of course, my gamer id is galvarium69
---
No I never moved my camp and in the stash box the only thing listed on display still is my undamaged abraxo cleaner.  The stuff that disappeared are my robots, a couple of globes, and undamaged trifold flag.  The only thing I did differently recently was build at some workshops so thats why I was wondering if for some reason it stole from my stash instead of my scrapbox.
---
It may not actually be much of a bonus but I would love it if eating a corpse made nearby NPCs, and even other players, do the radiation/vomit emote involuntarily.
---
Same here. I played yesterday mid-day, got off went about my business. Just logged on minutes ago and half my challenges are checked.
---
Ish I use that mod. My perks are set up for damage. I was just checking to see if this mod would be work it
---
I want the dine and dash perk back so bad
---
Let‚Äôs say I wanted to dupe a B2525 Fixer. I need to go to any NPC vendor, and put it up for sale, but before I confirm it, I open the social menu and go to a friend on a different world. I open the submenu and hover on join. When I‚Äôm ready, I spam the A button as quickly as I possibly can so I join his world. But because the social menu goes away so I can leave the world, I also confirm I want to sell the Fixer. I leave the world so fast it registers Insold the Fixer to the vendor, but it doesn‚Äôt register me selling the Fixer client side. When I want to collect my duped weapon, I need to rejoin the world with that vendor on it, and buy it. But the thing is, anybody on that world can come along and buy it from the vendor. This means you can steal my duped weapon right from under my nose.
---
That explains so much hnnng
---
Please say this is satire.
---
They seem to break when you change chassis. You don't have to drop to get in, I was wrong on that aspect and there are no locations for a fixed frame
---
This! They did a good job making the NPCs react to players and the environment, but somehow forgot this one!
---
Lol that's one way to piss of your fan base make a good junk of battlepass locked behind daileys challenges that's bugged...
---
An extra weekly repeatable. Kill XYZ Robots/Scorched/Super Mutants for 100 Score.
---
A weekly that encourages events as a group. Say 20 of them for 100 Score.
---
Basically a few more repeatable weeklys so it isn't exclusively about stacking Unyielding +Int, Relish &amp; Herbivore grinding all the high level mobs on a server. 
---
Also please, let the NW dailys be 1 game or less required I spent 3 hours both looking for locks and creatures in game. I don't hate it but Beth is really not selling  me on liking the game mode.
---
I also shoot people in the back when possible.  It's the safest way.
---
There‚Äôs dodgy, but serendipity is better because it doesn‚Äôt use AP. Also try messing around with getting resistances up with ironclad, Barbarian, evasive, though people debate if you need to max out all those. I max them all out but at the cost of some offense. I‚Äôm a very heavy defensive bloody build. Max serendipity, blocker, barbarian, ironclad, lvl3 lone wanderer, lvl2 fireproof (though I‚Äôm probably going to switch lvl 2 fireproof and lvl 5 ironclad for lvl3 fireproof and lvl4 or lvl 3 ironclad) max evasive, max dodgy sometimes but I like using Vats In melee so I turn it off a bunch.  But if I was to switch it up for more offense, I‚Äôd take away some of those and put more in luck for criticals and bloody mess
---
Thanks. New guy. Appreciate the help. I‚Äôve got to dump a lot of gear as I‚Äôve been carrying around a lot preparing for my builds. Gonna scrip a bunch of bolstering and vanguard armor. Closest ‚Äúbuild‚Äù type I was was heavy gunner tank. Only 1 bloodied heavy gun is an LMG and tears through my ammo.
---
I miss the original opening. I had seen a number of posts on reddit when they had the Nuclear Winter screen up for awhile,asking the devs to bring back the original. They did. But it seems like it was only for a short time,then Wastelands hit,and it changed again.
---
Berserker weapons for me will show say 86 for Gatling plasma but being my damage resistance is high it drops to 20 something but my bloodied never mess up and I‚Äôm a bloodied build
---
Ah you're ps4 :( I'd have happily accepted if xbox.
---
On that note, if anybody is Xbox lmk! I need to do the same one :)
---
Thanks. Good tips
---
All my weapons have been doing this. I still kill shit tho so its whatever
---
Feel free to stop by anyway, I know several of our people are multi-platform and I can't say for sure what we do and don't have
---
Agree.  Daily quests get old too, especially that picture one where you're like, "Why can't I just take 4 pictures, dammit?  Who designed this stupid quest!"
---
Hell, I'd just take 6 pictures and give 'em to everyone.  Including 2 to the picture subjects for "free" to make them feel grateful and throw off suspicion.
---
Ok appreciate the reply. So I should just keep server hopping backwater mine, enter the frame when it‚Äôs there, take the pieces off, and see if it proves me the bonuses? Then once I have one go into my stash box, pull out the pieces, and equip them? 
---
Sorry for all the questions haha
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, at the moment none of my friends have been on, so I just want to get it done with.
---
I like the idea of spend X minutes at maximum health just so that Bloodied characters absolutely cannot do it. :P
---
sure im down
---
I have 5 empty points since Adrenaline is broken so Thru Hiker went on.
---
I am on Xbox and would love some help. I know duping is bad and I don‚Äôt want to profit from it by any means, I just want a BE heavy weapon for personal use.
---
Nice, so you look for people in train stations?
---
If either item generated more water at a time it would put less of a premium on water camp locations that's for sure.
---
Me too!
---
Aww I love naked super mutants, they are hilarious. I once met a naked Grahm in a nuke zone
---
Underappreciated luck perk. 18% chance to reflect projectiles. What the card doesn't say is reflected rounds don't deal damage to you.
---
I accidentally chopped down once, took a second or two to figure out wtf was going on. Thought it was funny
---
That‚Äôs what I did at first, got several legacies out of it. Traded for other legacies. Even traded for a set of ass/sent armor!
---
I agree that it is a Fallout, it has the dark humor and the lore and everything else to make it fallout, even real speech checks and options, but I don't accept dealing with ward a trillion times as an endgame. Especially to unlock the one thing at the end of it all, practically everything else isn't worth the materials it's made with, much less five hundred bullion. I do appreciate that they are attempting to keep it alive but as it is there isn't much *to* keep alive, I'm sure they've gotten a number of new players with it's addition to game pass but when there's nothing to do except grind the queen the four thousanth time or do the handful events that have any value to a higher level again and again and again, it's disenchanting. The content they add is, while quality, short lived, and will guaranteeably add more grind when it's done. Add to that my seeming magnetism for the more game breaking bugs like getting pushed **through** the ground and I'm sure my point makes sense.
---
A BE+P GP coming right up
---
What‚Äôs your GT?
---
K will send friend invite

I have 40 on me I‚Äôll give you 5
---
Gladiator does not benefit unarmed weapons and hasn't for some time.
---
nice
---
Point is that they are obviously working on new content. It might(probably) will get delayed but it is coming. Which was the point of your post. Making new content for the playerbase
---
Oof. Well at least now I have room for Mister Sandman and Dodgy I guess
---
(And ps4)
---
That was never my intention.
---
That was my post, haha.
---
Found it randomly to fix it.
---
Try the mklink solution from one of the comments.
---
Is that offer still available? I‚Äôd be willing to pay! I‚Äôm xb1 too 
---
I haven‚Äôt had any luck at all trying to get it
---
Been happening since wastelanders update
---
What I did was go to different power armour locations, sometimes the dr bonus would appear after some time. You can try server hopping one place but it would be better to go to multiple because it is not guaranteed for armours to spawn consistently
---
It‚Äôs really not a problem. It is very rare for anyone to contest you. If they do just leave.
---
The cabins use a fair amount of budget, wouldn't say alot but more than I would like to use. And there's a limit of 3
---
Some of the player interactions are great in 76, I was on a public team today and when I brought a few buildings plans (nice and cheap) from a teammates camp she dropped a few more for free!! Was a really nice camp too so snapped a pic in front of the house :)
---
Encrypted was awesome, I‚Äôd do it again, it‚Äôs always an all out firefight throwdown with the robots. Good times.
---
Yeah that could work to much it might be way to much micro management, 1 permanent magazine makes more sense and a legendary perk to increase the number would be nice too.
---
My gt is SapphyChu
---
Looking to complete this too
---
If you're bloodied , unyielding. If not, chameleon
---
For stealth rifleman, I would focus on the sentinels attribute, you don‚Äôt really need vanguards with the super high damage res from secret service armor.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, vanguards is sweet but you‚Äôll be close to 400 DR without it.  If you are bloodied, UY as always
---
I looked for sentinels, weapon weight, poison res, fall damage, etc.  The QOL perks are really great to have.  I also like to have an auto stim and Cham piece.  If you get detected, you just stand up and sentinels kicks in.

I don't think there is extreme fatigue. This legendary run is enough to fill an hour or so. I personally have had good success with groups when it comes to running public events. The group function seems to have solved some of the boredom. Long as Bethesda doesn't take to long pumping out updates I think they can keep the player base entertained.
---
I just can‚Äôt shake these nightmares
---
Yeah that could work but might be very disheartening to lose a very rare magazine. I also believe to they won't be adding to many perks to the game yet and just do it for new weapons or mechanics.
---
NW challenges are extremely easy
---
Place a camp 3 times

Kill creatures

The revive one is mildly difficult but if you ask on this sub for help, atleast one person will join

one sec, can you send me the invite again?

Thanks a lot pal

try gun fu if you don't already

I'll make you team leader when you join incase you want to invite anyone else

Go to grafton highschool, there is a closet in the school near the gym I believe that has a ton of baseball stuff in it, including the hat

sorry, had to restart my game, the social wasnt updating

Chinese pistol, 'that gun' from New Vegas and a PPSH
---
You‚Äôre not alone......
---
Short answer is no. Long answer is nope.
---
No you can't. üò≠
---
at the release, it was 400 lbs, no its 800, no extras possible beside paying monthly for fallout 1st.  
---
you'll get used to it. just think about, what you really need and drop or gift the other stuff.
---
I mean why does it have to have a negative? Because we've been trained into thinking that way?
---
You use ingredients combined to make something better just like you do when cooking.
---
It shouldn't be any different just new recipes
---
What are you storing?
---
And when we started, back in BETA, we had 1/2 the stash space.
---
Alright that really sucks, thanks for the reply.
---
&gt; I lost a total of 10.500 SCORE. They will not give atoms back. They don‚Äôt care
---
If you say so. It kind of seemed like it from this comment.
---
I actually did that the other day... dropped near Morgantown Station in one of suitcases. Tons of useless rubbish...
---
Sorry for the necro, but this was (maybe still?) happening when you scrap stuff to the scrap box.
---
For example:
---
1. Store A in stash.
---
2. Scrap B, C, D, and E to the scrap box.
---
3. Look back in stash and A will have been scrapped as well.
---
I tried auto scrapping and individually scrapping and the results were the same.  Dunno how many times I grabbed an accordion or the vault tec alarm clock before I got them displayed/into a vendor.  I keep stuff that I can't display in vendors for max caps.  That way at least if I lose them, it's for a lot of caps.
---
I read this as a canary and was like why tf would we want a bird?
---
Tasteless people aren‚Äôt as tasty as Deathclaw Wellington or Smoked Mirelurk Filets. I‚Äôll go with the surf and turf thank you.
---
That‚Äôs mine, and pretty much every other persons experience from this. Maybe 1/100 will get compensated
---
What do you have in your stash, so two things, you probably not scrapping you're junk. Before you stash any junk, make sure you scrap any junk, this will lower the weight of your junk.
---
Same thing for weapons, no need to hoard a lot of weapons, you want to scrap them and gets mods from your guns.
---
As a new player, you should no way have maxed out your stash, so I am curious what you have in it.
---
just a plain super sledge? if you're on xbone i can make you one
---
What system? I can craft you one on xbox.
---
Go yourself to an event, do the follow me gesture, it'll show in the group interface. If you're lucky one Will show up. The next event maybe two. If you manage to run one or two events together the advantages os playing together will be too obvious to ignore them. That works for me
---
I tried this. Now I have foundations, stairs and a second-story floor I can't remove. So lame.
---
stash or junk container? 
---
you mention sub, so I'm assuming the regular 800 pound stash is what you're referring to. That's a no. That 800 is all we get for now, but you get unlimited junk in your other stash.
---
I was just saying today how I have hopes for the future seasons. It's clear that it's a good start to an idea. Too much camo in their space theme but I digress.
---
If they dropped some of the grindy elements and added in some more on theme items I'd love to see a Caravan, Survivalist, etc themed season.

MR FUZZY BAAAAACCCCKKKPPPPAAACCCCKKKK
---
Are you scrapping junk before stashing it? Also dont waste stash space on many weapons/armor early game. Scrap/scrip/sell them. You can also  bulk excess junk at Tinker bench at sell to npc vendors also.
---
my first pick would be huntersville or west tek, can be dropped by high lvl super mutants.
---
Did you buy a lottery ticket after that?
---
I thought mine was a steal at 1000 caps when I found it.
---
You can execute down players with it, I've never removed it once I found out. Revive player hahahah, EXECUTE!!
---
They just need to add harder content . The majority of it is way too easy for people who have been playing for over a year
---
Ah pc thanks tho
---
You must be new.
---
This is easily the worst challenge. I don't NW often, level 48 NW, and I did enjoy the other ones, but there are too many variables needed for this.
---
Happy to help too, added
---
You get both of the raider quests only the 1st time.  After that you only get 1 of the two each day randomly.
---
Think about this strategy.  Go ahead and buy another recall card.  If you do a Queen fight that obviously has some heavy hitting players, follow it up by launching Encrypted.  Even better if you can turn on a mic and announce after the Queen. More likely to get players in the mood for it.
---
&gt;Kill creatures
---
I believe the last one of these required 9 creatures? Not so easy and frankly it totally breaks the immersion of NW. I'm no fan of NW but it seems to me that anything you do that isn't keeping you hidden and hunting other players for rewards doesn't belong as a SCORE daily.
---
there's already enough xp boosts in the game
---
Just checked and I actually do have a fairly decent amount of unscrapped junk, thanks!
---
And you‚Äôve been scrapping materials every time you put them in? 
---
I didn‚Äôt run into this issue until I was level 30 or so and I would imagine that‚Äôs the case for most people. As long as you‚Äôre repairing weapons and scrapping the ones you don‚Äôt need/collect you should stay under 800 pretty easily. 
---
So either start selling some items at the railroad stations, drop them or scrap them at the workbenches.
---
Edit: To answer the other part; no, there is no way to increase camp stash only player weight limit. But I promise you it might seem like a big deal at first but it gets ALOT easier with time
---
I don't think they necessarily need to nerf it, they just need to make more builds viable and add more challenging content in my opinion
---
Nope not new.
---
Just a little LPT, cannibal let's you eat down players instead of revive.
---
Have fun,:-). I eat all vaultdwellers that die in events!!
---
Molotov...I make dozens at a time. All my characters have them. Some are spec for them. Great for tagging enemies. Easy XP for hordes and let players share loot. Save on ammo, by letting players/npc robots to finish them off. Doesn't send  kills flying away like other explosions. Easy to make.  Makes it easy to get the minimum damage on SBQ when it lands. I usually bring 20 to 30. Light her up and the spawns she drops.
---
How many have asked for Atoms instead of SCORE?  
---
And even 1 success means there‚Äôs a chance. 
---
Submit another ticket. They have a responsibility to address and correct issues.
---
Oh man, the game starts to get good at level 30. You're in for a treat.
---
Wait. Score is spread across all characters?
---
Could anyone fix this? I have the same problem
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure because the item level was only 30. I had scrapped the one I was using on accident
---
Not like xp but maybe ap
---
Two stars? I'd put un my vendor for 5000c
---
GG, Thanks!
---
Already did a few hours ago, and will keep doing so until I get compensated.
---
I Hate Bloodied, yet the character I'm currently playing is one.
---
Its fun with nice damage numbers one shotting many enemies even with my current lowly pistol setup...and with such low health occasionally being one shot in return!
---
No. They need to make other effects more useful, not reduce the ones that are useful. If you think nerfing bloodied is going to suddenly stop people from 2 shotting legendaries, I have some nice swamp land for sale.
---
Limit is probably because it takes up space on thier server rather then being stored on your console like fallout 4. They would spend so much extra money on server space just to hold our infinite stashs.
---
You can only increase your character carry weight, a backpack can add 60-120 lbs and each point of strength  increases your carry weight as well. My guy can carry 500 lbs, and he doesnt have the higher end backpack mod yet.
---
Bulking increases weight of many things, I know aluminum and lead are good to bulk though. Scrap every piece of junk before storing it.  Make sure you arent sitting on 3,000 scrap steel or something crazy cuz that will weight you down fast.
---
  Get rid of unnecessary ammo. Scrap weapons and armor you dont plan to use very soon.  Aid gets heavy pretty fast.
---
I would find my self daily selling a bunch of stuff I had till the vendors where empty, buying some plans and stuff I wanted, then selling more stuff with the few caps they get when you sell to them.
---
Also you can use perks or legendary armor effects to reduce the weight of numerous things. My armor reduces the weight of aid, I keep all aid on my person since you only drop junk on death it has stash priority. Make sure you dont have a bunch of stimpacks, they get heavy, find out what a good number for your character is and sell off the extra if that's a problem.
---
 tip: if you use ballistic ammo (.45, shotgun shells,...), try to have the bandolier perk level 2 in your build, its in STR and as stealth commando, my only perk there. it reduces the ammo weight to 10%. i usually carry like 40 to 50k ammo with me. it frees a lot of space :)
---
Happens way too fucking often. Expect a fix in 6 months. Or never.
---
You need to factor in the enemies damage and energy resist.
---
I hit 33 or 34 today.  So I am happy with my progress.
---
I ran a silo an hour ago on PC, no problem.  Then someone else launched right after me, so I assume they had no problem.
---
Also, not familiar with your problem.  Sounds like things haven‚Äôt loaded in yet.  Just need more time???
---
No. Before I switched from a stealth rifleman build with an instigating lever action, I was still one to two shotting everything. And now I‚Äôm a bloodied rifleman, and it‚Äôs still exactly the same for me. A lot of builds can put out high damage. Bloodied is just popular. Junkies is the next most popular. Sneak rifles are after that. But all three can do a lot of damage.
---
PA has a bunch of perks that don't show, but are really there.  Crappiest PA is still better than SS non-PA in a nuke zone.  Confirmed from data mine.  Google it.  I get why people are whining about  non-PA getting too powerful, but it's an inaccurate comparison when you don't take into account the hidden perks.
---
Thanks ^_^
---
I‚Äôm just about to hit 32. Not playing a tonne either.
---
Ok, I don't wanna play with you anymore
---
The problem is sneaking, not bloodied
---
Sneaking is too easy to be overly efficient with for no tradeoff, it's too easy to be nearly undetectable even when your gun basically rubs up against your target, the damage multiplier is too high and should not proc more than once per unique target (so if you want high sneak damage you should use slow rate of fire weapons, not automatics) and you shouldn't be able to get sneak damage in caution.
---
And to top it all, all you need is a one cost card to basically reset the sneaking when you manage to somehow fuck up and get detected, it's stupid and what really pushes ridiculously high damage outputs.
---
If players couldn't have 100% uptight on being essentially invisible and multiplying their damage by x3, then it would be fine.
---
I think the new score system added a lot of new play potential.
---
I run a bloodied cammando full unyielding full biuld team and max exp buff and get about 500 too 700 exp per super mutant well say 500 just for easy math and it seems to be the average and that's here say 30 super mutants at west tek ( dout it even that many) that means he would have  to do a full west tek run every 3.5 minutes for 81 hrs straight 
---
Its unbelievable that even given facts and real numerical data you can still be defending these guys. And it's funny your saying he did It in four day but then in your last post you said he had is weekly's reset where in the world do you live that 1 week is 4 days
---
Unyielding Sneak or Chameleon Sneak, the sentinel effect doesnt work when you are crouched. You would miss out on a potentially 3.75x dmg multiplier if you are standing
---
i would probably constantly use Tesla 5: -20% Heavy weapon ammo consumption
---
No they don't, and you don't get extra score either.
---
Sorry to op I‚Äôm on Xbox so can‚Äôt help them, can help you though if you‚Äôre still stuck? I‚Äôve gotta complete it too
---
B on Xbox. Figured it out a couple days after I got the damn thing. Works on all terminals thankfully, some can take many button presses to back out of.
---
The faction daily gold bullion quests have been resetting for me at 5PM Pacific. There are only three: photos for the snooty robot, one of the two Crater quests, and retrieving foundation's stolen goods for brother Ward. Be sure to check your Daily quest list to see if any you haven't seen an alert for are available but not active. You only see an alert once when a daily pops that you aren't actively ignoring. It is easy to miss them as a result.
---
Well get to work!
---
And now I want to do this when I play with my friend next time.
---
you will find enough of them, dont worry :)  
---
btw, are you aware that there are 2 unique variants of it? [have a look here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_sledge_(Fallout_76)) how and where to get  
---
edit: link not working. its this https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_sledge_(Fallout_76)
---
Yeah there are so many good magazine cards, Some are pretty bad and might need a buff but most are good.
---
Katana
---
Smh I hope season 2 will b better.. They should give 250 atoms or 300..
---
Thanks man I‚Äôll use the knowledge you have bestowed upon me wisely and hopefully fix my stash lol, just checked and scrapped all the junk that I didn‚Äôt have scrapped silly me
---
What level are you?
---
I'd love to see that. Platform?
---
So much yes to the Bozar! I loved pickpocketing that gun from the Gunrunners guards in Fallout 2 üòÅ
---
I get the impression they just wanna bring back Curling. Damn Canadians. 
---
(Jokes aside I love my Canadian neighbors!)
---
Looks like others have asked.  But I‚Äôm also interested.  :)
---
I'm still a noob, I just choose random perks that seem good at the moment that I level up lol
---
But yeah, that perk saves you a lot of time scavenging for food or water.
---
37. Getting there. Had enough atoms saved up from before to buy out the last chunk of the board, just need to get to 60-70.
---
I use them to regain health after exploring instead of using a stimpack sometimes
---
Way ahead of the curve at 37. Nice job
---
That is comedy gold you are not what so ever a bad person
---
Up at The Freak Show is usually a spawn by the honey beast pen
---
Western chaps can go up to 5k caps. Surveyors is common tho.
---
I would think any ‚Äòextra‚Äô damage would be worth it? But.... that depends on what you have to sacrifice in your build/perks?
---
That‚Äôs some OG shit right there. I miss that game so much.
---
It doesn't take much time at all, and lasts for two hours. 5%xp boost isn't bad, but 10% would probably get more people to lay down.
---
I can help PSN RonS234.
---
I have to get rid of Gunsmith
---
I wish we could actually pet dogs in the game.
---
I can't wait for the sorry emote too. The heart icon is either what someone does when you drop them free stuff or when an asshole does something dickish and wants to be extra smug about it.
---
kill random mobs like a man go hunting
---
Only if you can give caps to the statue and it spits out broken level 1 items.
---
Have a look at Angry Turtels video: https://youtu.be/byE4qyx8kwA at whitesprings i was around 40 fps some times down to 15 fps at ultra settings orhter places around 80. But after these changes I'm at 80 at whitesprings and steady 120 outside. And really I can't see a big difference except I don't have any grass more with is nice so much easier to find corpes and blood piles.
---
if youre fallout fan and ready to grind every single day, just buy fallout 1st for just 1Month , it has infinite junk storage , when u cancel your subscription the junk will stay in that scrap box , u can withdraw anything u want but u cant deposit there anything. After that, never give a dollar anymore to that lazy company
---
Thats a good idea actually. I always run the queen in the hopes (silly me) of getting calibrated shocks or emergency protocols plans.
---
So ya, il try that.
---
western and chaps are not that rare anymore. the tickets to get them were duped and the market got flooded. chaps should go for about 1-1.5k at most now. I've had one in my vendor for ages
---
Would use definitely.   It's a cool idea to have a food processor.   I mean it's a nuclear future and a food processor in the camp is not farfetched.   Ooh...wait.  Replicator....üòéüëç
---
This calls for some research and testing, no way am I reaching 3k dmg only using one iron fist perk card.
---
I hope your right, that will be 9 points worth of perks I could use differently.
---

---
I miss Space Quest
---
You have to be on a private team not a public team for a teammate to build in your camp. Also if you move your camp and don‚Äôt have the plan learned, you can‚Äôt rebuild that object
---
Scrap all the stuff for lead and steel. 
---
Get acid and cloth for gunpowder. 
---
Make ammo.
---
What you've just described there sounds absolutely doable. Le shrug.
---
EDIT: Wasnt 81 hours straight either.
---
I claimed a workshop from someone and killed him. Proud of me?
---
I would spec harder into stealth or power armor.
---
Stealth: Push your Agility higher, get those stealthy perks, and consider changing your weapon to a knife or Unarmed. With sneak attack bonuses, knives are strong enough to drop most enemies with 1 swing so anything that hits harder than that is pointless(and slower) against regular enemies. Unarmed lets you get damage high enough to kill the scorchedbeast queen in 2 hits if you stack enough buffs, so there's that. Also, if you use a full set of Unyielding armor with a base 15 Agility as far as NPC enemies are concerned you have a permanent Stealth Boy on.
---
Power armor: Just run around and hit things. You lose Serendipity as an option(it should really explain this in the game!), but gain the guaranteed damage reduction option Emergency Protocols. Plus, PA is much more durable than regular armor.
---
There is a perk in luck which makes you find more ammo, very useful early on
---
I think that's what they were going for, but for some players, it didn't quite work.
---
I get 2k out of a mole miner gauntlet with just iron fist so that's not unreasonable for a dcg, especially if you're using bloody mess or talons or something.
---
That being said, I use to run full demo expert with my gauss minigun. But now I only use the 2nd rank of that card, plus max nerd rage, max stabilized and maxed batteries included. If I didn‚Äôt have/use a bloodied ffr gauss minigun, I would probably swap out nerd rage for max demo expert plus something else.
---
Any idea when it unlocks? I‚Äôm currently level 16
---
No, that is just hilarious!
---
No but I like your username, here take my upvote
---
There really are enough tracks at this point that it should be entirely possible. Some of the longer more ambient style tracks on the OST are gorgeous, I‚Äôd definitely just loop those while playing.
---
I am at 37 as well. Hoping double xp weekend will get me further.
---
U need a team of two runners
---
capture workshops. don't defend workshops. retake workshops. 
---
run the athletics course at sunnyside for easy loots
---
xD
---
It's been doing that for me as well, since the last patch.  They changed the icons from WOrkshop icons to the Blue ones.. which is DUMB, because they no longer stand-out and if you have to guess where workshops are if you are new.  But yeah, buggered.
---
So play an interment for the ap regen?
---
Sell ammo at camp vendors. Farm the resources to craft It and sell them for a cap a pop. Lucky whole mine is best for lead. If you get the mining power armor you can get more from each lead node. 45 and 5.56 sell pretty well. Besides that sell plans you already know. Legendary‚Äôs you can‚Äôt script throw in for 50 caps to help others max out. I also spammed a bunch of water purifiers and sold the water to robot vendors.
---
But do the weapons not break faster without Gunsmith or is that not something to worry about
---
There is new dupe method, works right now, Bethesda doesn't care...
---
A god might be exaggerating it a bit but I really do appreciate the kind words!  xD
---
I just launched the game and i now have the nine dailys again.
---
Correct.  But if you‚Äôre using rifles it‚Äôs definitely worth it, even for 1 point.
---
so are you saying that if i don't get say challenge 3 and it the next day one drops i can't get challenge 3 ? because i don't quite understand how it works or will it only change when i complete say 3
---
Bloodied does alot of damage but has its downside of being able to be killed in one hit
---
Exactly! I really miss fours ambient music lmao
---
Yup
---
Just DM‚Äôd you. Thank you!
---
It's funny when they dont realise, I did Whitespring run with someone and about half way through they started getting their arse kicked, they were shouting and swearing like crazy, I figured it out, but didnt say anything :-)
---
3260 hrs (so far) so thank you I still really enjoy this game
---
Should be level 30 by today so doing great.
---
As I said. Game changer. Anyone who doesn't have this after level 50 is missing out BIG TIME
---
It‚Äôs marvelous. It‚Äôs a good time to finally get that one weapon you‚Äôve always wanted to try
---
If you want to catch several encrypted events people are always posting on lfg
---
3000 to 5000 caps is about right. Two stars doesn‚Äôt help, and this is not a vats weapon so the second star doesn‚Äôt add much value. Still, to someone possibly just getting into a junkies heavy build this weapon still should have at least some value to the right buyer.
---
EDIT: I just reread that you mentioned the magic affect. For that you need either junkies, instagating, medics or stalkers with either 33% vats, 50% limb damage, or bashing damage. The 50% vats critical does unfortunately does not make the weapon magic. Also worth noting, if you do get a magic weapon (combinations above), the damage won‚Äôt show much but the health bar on enemy targets should drain quickly.
---
So you're saying I missed out at level 115!
---
32 I think lol
---
I periodically look though my stash to find the things that are hitting me the hardest that I may not be aware of. You‚Äôd be surprised how much of your stash or inventory can be take up by miscellaneous ore, gun powder, aid items, and those damn missiles, grenades, and mini nukes they sneak in your inventory on quest completion. Damn it game! I don‚Äôt want them  ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I do it for the diseases
---
Well that is good then! I was thinking I was woefully behind.
---
Do you have that in game chat mod too?
---
They are Erratic Radstags. From the wiki: "A crazed variant of the radstag that will not hesitate to defend itself."
---
The most efficient way is have 3 runners total. Usually you get around 40 per run clearing all 4 tunnels. It's faster and easier to have 1 guy collect and deposit then switch to another guy in a rotation. The time it takes all the ore to respawn for any individual is longer than the event but each person there has their own spawns of ore. Therefore, 2.5 runners are needed to get the 100 efficiently.
---
They're supposed to be protected but they broke that with wastelanders or at least with the introduction of the stein case. I've lost countless items out of display cases because of that issue. (clean mr. handy fuel, red star pin, just to name a few) my beer stein case lost all of the steins except the ones you can craft, and in it's place is a gold cup that I can't remove.
---
This is not a case of not being able to place your camp and items getting scrapped (though this shouldn't be happening when you have a scrap box full of scrap materials) it's happening while your camp is placed.
---
Yes!    Also it‚Äôs fun to just join a public group and do events with them.   You will get caps when they compete events and you can share perk cards as well.
---
49 so far
---
xD   
---
Some of the Erratic Radstags died but most survived and yes they killed two Yao Guais. By the time I arrived they had already killed the first one.
---
Build your camp near water and set up a few water purifiers.  Sell the water to vendors. Easy money.
---
Legacy weapons are now worth caps. That is how bad this is.
---
Annosmith is agility. Superduper is luck.
---
I'm 172 now. Yes, missing out üòÇ
---
You got haters upvote this truth ppl
---
Make it boost action points giving you more to use and raise intelligence
---
Todd Howard: *kicks in the door* ‚ÄúWHATS THAT? YOU WANT ANOTHER CURRENCY TO GRIND THAT YOU CAN ONLY EARN THROUGH 2 BORING DAILY QUESTS?‚Äù
---
You just described me...old timer...beta player...on my fourth end game character.
---
Sure! DM me your steam name/code! 
---
Forewarning, I don't have a mic yet.
---
Awesome, thanks for clearing that up.
---
I always end up short since nobody else seems to run.
---
Are you mad? 50% VATS sucks on any heavy weapon. 3k max, because it's junkies
---
I saw that, but I play with an Xbox controller. I dont feel the need to type or use a keyboard when my voice can handle all that just the same.
---
Lol.  Thats great
---
ty -_-
---
I'm pretty sure they're banning people now. Ban waves
---
Sent ya a message!
---
Also if u didnt kno, u can make a public team by yourself and get the benefits of Herd Mentality, so +2 specials even playing alone. Strange in numbers still needs an actual teammate tho.
---
Im glad you still enjoy the game after so many hours. Do you have multiple characters?
---
Click the link. Tells u where u should be and updates every day. It‚Äôs really useful
---
Just had a group do this to me earlier.  Accidentally ate a corpse.  I have the vegetarian mutation.   Took radiation damage from the glowing ghoul I ate and died.  Did not inspire me to take the perk in the future
---
42 and counting.
---
Not one bit, but yes, they are squishy
---
Wait is that actually going to be a thing?
---
It's sad to watch dupers make a boatload of rare items and real world money with their carbon copies of Legacies and B2525 The Fixer and us law abiding citizens of the Wasteland still not being able to buy something that's essentially worthless since supply at the moment is unlimited because the greedy exploiters who mass produce them still inflate prices by asking for hundreds of flux and many tens pf thousands of caps or full sets of godly armor.
---
No problem. It really takes a good, well communicating, team of 4 where 1 guy runs and 3 defend then the runner swaps with someone else or an easier way is a group of 6 where 3 or 4 defend and 2 guys are running at once. You can run 2 at once with the team of 4 if the 2 remaining defenders have good weapons and use glow sight but things get pretty hairy.
---
I‚Äôll always help lower level players ‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢7
---
Its just you
---
Make diluted stimpacks and when possible eat food or sleep for health regen.
---
Just got this error myself on PS4, I traveled to another server to help a friend with something then tried to return to my private server and this error hit, I know its still there as I'm talking to two friends using it!
---
That's a hoax, tbh. The ones they are banning are the ones doing the godmode glitch and completing the run in a day, or are duping ungodly amounts of items.
---
Maybe It takes a week, but eventually someone Will pay 5000 just because the gun type and the prefix
---
Oh. I thought they were banning everyone any anyone
---
Try to get a companion. Explore your surroundings. Do strange quest. look into all the nooks and crannies. find plans and make your camp pretty. collect funny things and sell them at your camp. piggie back off people killing scorch beast queens. Gather recourses that are expensive, and focus on making armor
---
There's law in the wastelands?
---
Rank 31, I've done all dailies / weeklies so far except for NW.
---
Well damn. Apparently I don't know the plan for it so I can't make one for you.  I have a level 50 legendary one but that won't do you a whole lot of good right now.
---
Legacy is a weapon that doesn't drop anymore. Legendary is a weapon that anyone has a chance of receiving in adventure mode.
---
I passed him though
---
Thats great. When i was level 19, a 100 plus level came up to me. Helped me reach level 20 by bacling me up against some super mutants and dropped me some level 20 deep pocketed hardened leather armor that I used until about level 50. Made my experience so much easier!
---
Can I pls buy one off you ?
---
I really loved the period when I was always broke. Now it's too easy
---
You thinking what I'm thinking??? Tomorrow?
---
A VERY cool idea. Maybe it should come with a lesser buff? To incentivize people to cook their own food. 
---
Or maybe the cost of the anticeptic is enough to create that effect.
---
Thank you tho. I found a few of the 40-50 level ones, it seems like finding the lower level variant is kinda hard. I just enjoy smacking things with it a lot. The power attack is no joke
---
That event can't be done between only two people
---
I only done some item dupes. Not that much like 10 technical data worth
---
5050 hours... still here. Enjoy my lvl 205 no power armor heavy gunner build over my lvl 1050 bad ass handmade brain build
---
Caps have value again - that's how bad it is :-)
---
Lifegiver.
---
Yes, I agree. I‚Äôm saying it would cool if making different recipes was a viable daily option without having to go across half the map to get something cuz what you got from yesterday has already spoiled after an hour of playing. I didn‚Äôt mean to make it seem like I was looking down on different play styles, just making a suggestion.
---
There's a bug where your unyielding armor doubles its buff.
---
It is kind of mean and rude. Would you like it or find it funny if someone accidentally exposed you to something you are disgusted by or fear? Like if you feared spiders and someone made you open up a box of chocolates and SURPRISE! its actually full of spiders? Yes I understand humor is often rooted in the suffering of others cuz for some reason people find it funny, and I guess online it is mostly harmless, but if your intentions are to inherently be mean, it is kind of bad.
---
Considering technical data dupes itself in your inventory I think you‚Äôll be fine.
---
I mean we did get a nice cosmetic for it, but sometimes I even have days of wanting to toss it out the 16th floor of my condo, but I also learn more each day and have fun just exploring and seeing the small things the devs place in the game. The teddy bear scenarios, the skeleton placements, everything!
---
There‚Äôs more to this game than endgame for me. I started playing 2 years ago when I bought my first PS4 and the GameStop kid trash talked it. I‚Äôve never beaten a FO game yet but also bought 4.
---
I beat 4 while I started playing 76, but the mechanics are what made the difference. I felt like 76 had more control, of course in the beginning it was hard learning the balance and collecting supplies. Now I‚Äôm level 220? And only one main character and I still have a blast playing.
---
I‚Äôve met some great people via the reddit channels and in game.
---
I guess it‚Äôs all just wanting to make sure everyone has a good time!
---
See you in the wasteland sometime (as long as you ain‚Äôt no Raider.) jk!
---
Yes 5 but mostly just use my main which is level 640
---
That just sounds like the junk jet but with extra steps.
---
Add me. craiggribbs and let me know your IGN too.
---
Just went to Grafton dam and got a level 30 one lmao
---
Does it have to be your own bed or can be anyone‚Äôs bed?
---
Lol last team alive cleaning up stragglers at that point standing still was a bad idea 1 on one maybe but never a team
---
Not an issue with an explosive combat shotgun and the perk that cripples.
---
Deathclaws are no problem when they can‚Äôt walk.
---
Only floaters are annoying do you need another gun to take them down
---
Yet dying doesn‚Äôt have any downside at all.
---
That's really good tbh. I was a bit spooked about the ban wave under the impression everyone would get banned
---
Bonus of +3 to SPECIALs from herd mentality when in an actual group using Strange in Numbers
---
Most of the groups I've joined wind up doing their own separate things, and only join ranks for the big public events (SBQ, Encryptid, etc.)
---
My carry weight is already at 530
---
Most fallouts just end so it‚Äôs hard to make an end game that feels like it belongs vs just put there
---
Legacy means it's been removed from the loot pool of the game. They used to drop from enemies but no new ones can be dropped or acquired any longer, the ones left in the game are old ones from back when they could spawn in the game, or are duped copies of the original spawn. Things like explosive energy weapons, legendary The Dragon guns, reportedly legendary Rippers (people have been saying these no longer drop as legendary but I can't say with 100% certainty if that's the case or not, though it's been a long time since I've had a legendary one drop.)
---
Legendary just means any weapon or armor with stars (each star represents a legendary effect.) Your Fixer is legendary, but not legacy.
---
Pushy high level players are too eager to play big brother. It's annoying. Power leveling and gifting weapons takes a lot of the strategy and fun out of the game. Some folks want that, like 7 year old children who play Fallout with Dad, but most players want to play the game. I'm absolutely being considerate, friend. I'm considering the majority of players who don't want their hand held in a Fallout game.
---
Shit i don‚Äôt have those, maybe that‚Äôs why I die so much in sbq fights
---
Seeing how popular It is, they'll design skins for it
---
special stats need to be capped
---
I think the plasma has better fire rate and it has the splitter rifle which zhoots more projectiles
---
Also remember to only take workshops in a private server.
---
I‚Äôd recommend dumping the vast majority of those outfits, making food in reasonable amounts, and generally avoid hoarding.  This is not the game for that.  You‚Äôre bogging your game down by collecting, forcing the game to keep track of hundreds of unique items.  
---
I promise that you can get almost every outfit again with minimal effort, you won‚Äôt need any notes or holotapes once you complete the related quest, and 5-6 food items will last you through several hours of play.  Your game will perform much, much better and you‚Äôll have more fun without crippling lag.
---
Scrounger
---
Yup. Plus +18 to all specials as a baseline is great. Even puts my dump stats in the mid 20s
---
True but that only works if you have friends to invite or you won‚Äôt get the event bonus.
---
Modded it too with heated coils
---
Oh, I knew there was a catch,  I thought I would be a good idea to reduce cost with them , but I guess I'll stick with my traditional camps, thanks for the response .
---
Ahh, I dont even have gladiator equipped.  I'm just prematurely senile, looks like I've known better at some point in the past o.o thanks.
---
Happens, not all the time, but enough to be annoying :-)
---
useful we can buy as gift, my wife as a lot of point in bings :)
---
If there's a challenge to take workshops, such as this week's claim 5 workshops one, it makes life a lot easier.
---
We've all been there buddy! Hang in there, it does get a whole lot easier.
---
I think I spent my first bunch of levels using only melee until I accumulated enough junk to actually feed a gun for any prolonged period of time. Granted I wasn't a melee character, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do...
---
The ISS
---
Unfortunately, I've done Lode Baring many times and it has not remedied the issue.
---
Same here! I'd start it up but I learned my lesson last time, just got idiots who caused the thing to fail :/
---
I'd love to have the Fixer plan
---
Awsome!   People can be surprising.
---
I believe it can be any bed under your control, or someone on your team has control of. I think you can regenerate health in any bed, but random beds sometimes have diseases. Best to stick with a bed in your camp, if you can help it.
---
For my first time in a private world... Not a good look.
---
We‚Äôve all been there friend. The wasteland was wild in those days.
---
I put him on the roof so when he gets out of his station, he breaks his legs. Crawls around screaming ‚ÄúKill Kill‚Äù
---
He wasn't talking about ammosmith, that's to craft ammo. He said to *find* ammo, which is scrounger and it's luck.
---
And canning should make foods last longer and add a little something extra.
---
I'm in the same boat, but there IS a roadmap so we already know when the content is coming. We just have to be patient at this point.
---
I got 500 purified water the other day from people who were duping at Grafton train station.
---
They were probably just figuring it out but I like water and am going to bathe in it then sell it
---
oh do some research this bug is more than year old.  lol they dont care.
---
I want to see a good amount of interesting mods for all existing weapons before new ones, there's loads of weapons that have like 3 mods and they all are in the same slot, boring.
---
Press square to execute.
---
Solar armour always crafts at 3 stars, at least for me, SS tends to be hit/miss but more 3 than not I think
---
That‚Äôs the one
---
Whats a brain build?
---
Let that be a lesson to you that humans are omnivores lol.
---
If the bed is not covered you will get a disease
---
Yeah, it was confirmed by Bethesda that a sorry emote is going to be added.
---
With the claim workshop key being the same as the change view key there's been a few of times I've accidentally started contesting a workshop someone else owns. For some reason no confirmation box appeared.
---
Also there's been some times when I've logged in to a laggy server and it doesn't fill in that a workshop is actually owned until about a minute in.
---
Going afk, health boost w/o stimpaks,  xp boost,  ignoring people in your camp while you're waiting tp log off (but they're still browsing)
---
When I was ~ Level 15 a high level player showed up and dropped a Fixer plan for me. I wish I had known at the time what a great gift I was getting so I could have thanked them properly.
---
Man...that brings me back. Loved the space quest series.
---
so that's what is up with the 'Press X to execute'? I've never clicked it before but now I just might solely to see what it is like
---
Everything is broke in this game. People are just now figuring it out.
---
They aren't, yeah, but people definitely will still buy them for up to 5k. Sold 4 within the past month, all for 5k.
---
Beds on the ground (sleeping bag or mattress) give diseases. A bed that sits off the ground with a proper frame does not. Even if you own it, a sleeping bag on the ground can give you a disease.
---
Another one enters the fold }:)
---
The heart emote might have been a sign to help him since it was your turrets that were killing him. Maybe he wanted you to stop them not realizing they are automatic??? 
---
I feel ya though. I did that once helping to defend a workshop and felt like Pooh. Since they I avoid them unless they are mine. I‚Äôm in Appalachia to rebuild and help others, not kill innocent folk. LoL.
---
Just last week my wife had all the teddy bears in game in display cases in her CAMP. She crafted some gunpowder and it took all the bears out of the cases before it touched the over 9k cloth she has sitting in her scrapbox.
---
Keep the gold for yourself. You'll find it a good move down the road.
---
You get it as a drop from events or buy it from Antoine at Whitespring resorts.  The CORE reason for cooking one of these is that it will be your final part of the Tadpole Cook badge.  It's nearly impossible to collect 3 Scorchbeast meat without them spoiling, and then getting Cranberries is no easy task.  You'll NEVER cook enough of these for the buffs to really matter.  Good luck at 1.
---
I just not understand why other effects like junkies or anti armour are cut at 50% and this one no
---
We pretty much do the same when we have to.
---
I've always been one haha
---
PC here. Same thing.
---
This is why I run a bloodied build as a shotgun player.
---
I die more often than I‚Äôd like in big fights (in particular) but the extra special stats are too good.
---
Add in serendipity, ricochet, dodgy, blocker...then you‚Äôve got a really good chance of avoiding damage all together or taking a lot less if they do hit you.
---
Main issue I have is the rads from the SBQ
---
Have the sneak peeks too? Those people you see could be junkie builds too, if they aren‚Äôt bloodied.
---
Kill super mutants as others have mentioned.   Also join a public team that gives an XP boost and do events as they pop up.    Also you can claim and defend workshops.  
---
Someone on here has posted other things you can do so maximize XP like sleeping for the well rested bonus and foods, chems , bobble heads you can use.
---
Yes this has gotten a bit crazy, not complaining but right now I've got:
---
Str 59,   Per 34,   End 10,   Cha 40,  Int 45,  Agi 47,  Luc 44
---
Do you have maxed all three riflemen cards?
---
Bloody mess?
---
Tank Killer?
---
All the best!
---
More mods would be very nice.
---
Even public servers are spotty at best. Got the "camp could not be placed" notification 5 times in a row earlier today.
---
Just run a damn script that makes sure I don't end up on the exact same server.  Stayed on there the first time but nothing was going on so I left only to get thrown back on there 4 more times
---
And yeah, it was the exact same server unless every vendor on the map hopped to the same server as me in unison.
---
And repair the damn turrets!
---
I see people getting on the events group but then nobody does events like rad rumble or project paradise? Everybody sits around until someone drops a nuke. Boring!
---
Lode Baring event. There's quite a bit of Black Titanium in that mine, especially if you use Excavator PA.
---
Legacys are legendary weapons that are no longer in the loot pool. The most sought after are the energy weapons with explosive effects. The explosive effect on legacy energy weapons retained the pre explosive nerf damage. Meaning they do 100% weapon damage per explosion vs the 25% that current weapkns do. Thats per beam by the way, sonif you have say a scattered laser and it shoots like 7 beams, you get 7 explosions doing 100% weapon damage, making the extremely powerful. Things like flamers teslas and cryolaters have their projectiles act like bullets rather than theyre normal attacks aswell,  giving them a huge range.
---
They used to be some of the most valuble weapons in the game. They were most comonly used by dbags to flex in public events or use as an OP PVP weapon against people just trying to get resources at a workshop. However  just this passed week they have been duped to infinity and beyond so they arent quite so rare anymore. Guess theyre not so special anymore LOL.
---
Your welcome and those of us that you have had positive interactions with are happy to help and glad you decided to stay in W. Virginia, and apologize for any negative encounters you may have had with the crazies still roaming the mountainside.
---
Well caps needed value, so it‚Äôs good and bad?
---
True but I guess that‚Äôs more expected of a human controlled character, hahaha. But like another user said they also sometimes vanish or hide then vanish back where they spawned with full HP. I had a level 91 glowing death claw to like 25% HP and it hid and vanished and respawned at full HP.
---
Yes!!!
---
Lucky! I'd actually buy it if I could find somebody selling it, I encountered somebody selling Formula P the other day and bought the Bear Claw plan once, but normally I just show up and see the exact plans that I am selling(No, not mounted. I toss those into the Morgan Airport)
---
But if your paying gold bullion for something, you should get some advantage.  It‚Äôs like making 3* legendary items worse than normal items, so people who don‚Äôt have legendaries feel ok about themselves.
---
A water location would still have an advantage of being able to turn out massive amounts of purified water.
---
You wont get banned for buying them?
---
Agility and Luck perks can up your per shot damage big time.
---
Killing mole miners and scrapping their stuff is an easy way to get it.     Check all the mines on the map.
---
Welcome to the challenges of the game.
---
I quite like it, needs more songs though, think they're limited as it's classed as live broadcasts, so they pay royalties I guess :-)
---
I dunno. It‚Äôs not like I duped anything. I‚Äôm just finding some good stuff at the train station vendors.
---
It is fine
---
I have the opposite as a bloody build.
---
Until I equip a weapon it doesn‚Äôt show the proper amount of damage I will do, it shows the normal amount.
---
By any chance, are you looking at energy weapons while having the mutation that lowers their damage?
---
It might be your specific perk build, sure. But I run a rifle build, and I'll tell you probably the top two things to be mindful of:
---
1. Attacking from Stealth. Automatic damage increase.
---
2. Instigating prefix on your rifle. Massive increase on the first shot damage. With my Instigating Level Action Rifle, I usually don't need a second shot.
---
Now, there are a huge number of other things these people could be doing. Food buffs, special weapons against those enemy types, chems (Junkie's build), etc. All of that could impact damage without being a Bloodied build.
---
If you post your build, folks will come along and offer you advice on it. But weapon selection will definitely factor into your ability to murder stuff, so it might be that you need to do a little shopping.
---
All that being said, sometimes "it just be like that". Some days I'm VATS headshotting level 68 Super Mutants without a care in the world, and seemingly the very next day those same dudes are taking a quarter of a health bar per shot and I'm suddenly getting swarmed.
---
Okay, for the sneak perks, yes. I have the Cover Operator, Escape Artist, &amp; Sneak. All maxed.
---
Hm. When you built at workshops, was your camp placed in the world? I'm thinking if your camp couldn't be placed because someone was in its spot, that would put things back in stash.
---
Anyones
---
Cool thanks!
---
Because they don't have much downside for a Junkies or any for AntiArmor.
---
Has anyone else been banned or....
---
I‚Äôm on the fence with dodgy.
---
When I‚Äôm in my armour it‚Äôs fine to have due to AP refresh.
---
When I have to ditch the armour for a nuke zone, it eats my AP BUT does keep me alive.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs crazy seeing what b 25 25 fixers are being traded for now. Red asylums too. Can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs legit anymore
---
Wow i never knew that, so beds on the ground = bad idea
---
For the Rifleman, yes. All three are maxed &amp; equipped. I don't have Bloody Mess &amp; I have Tank Killer maxed but not equipped. I have the perk but at level 1.
---
I have also been experiencing damage lag to the point where I am getting hit multiple times by a dead enemyz.  I am randomly loosing my unyealding armour effect. And having trouble engaging vendor bots to sell items.
---
Those bastards are deep in my bad memories
---
Its definitely you, The music fits so well in 76
---
Really? If you don't mind, which ones?
---
But I hearted him back and then he gave me a thumbs down? It‚Äôs pretty funny trying to communicate with only a few emotes to choose from lol. So much lost in translation. 
---
Being the good guy is also my MO. I‚Äôm not role playing for any particular faction but I like to show up and help that level 10 guy fight off the level 14 snallygaster, etc. never fun when my actions are interpreted negatively.
---
Congrats on the new toy.  It's fun to play with
---
I have a spare fixer plan, if you're on Xbox. Free.99
---
&lt;3
---
Great to know, thanks!
---
I'm going to disagree with you there. Personally, while 3+ is ideal, if I am one and the other is willing to get ore, I can hold the defensive line almost indefinitely on my own assuming my gatling plasma is not on like 30 rounds.
---
I will acknowledge that in my case it is a legacy TSE gatling plasma, but people with such weapons are common enough (on pc anyway, I'm sure theres some hacked weapons here as well, and I know the environment differs between platforms) that theres generally someone around that can hold the main area.
---
That said, I prefer 3+ as then i can sit comfortably on one of the two main sides and just play Gandalf with the ghouls on my .50 cal.  
---
Mileage may vary, but in general my only issue with this event is that with the current xp grind fest going on, most people aren't gathering ore and are just farming ghouls forever for the arguably greater xp yield.
---
The western outfit and the chaps version sell out of my machine around 1k to 1.2k. I don‚Äôt try charging more then that since they aren‚Äôt rare anymore
---
Fair enough, I don't mind shopping. Instigating you say? Any other legendary effects that might help?
---
Vid?
---
I am! Wanna do this now?
---
Without rng what‚Äôs the point
---
Get Bloody Mess....and tank killer.
---
Two shot is okay, but if you are a sneak build, instigating is better.
---
Just stop dude.
---
I mean certainly make the request for new content (though you'll bump heads with those that want Bethesda to focus on much needed bug fixes) but why not just put down the game and play something else or do something else.
---
Bethesda are psychologically manipulating you to feel compelled to keep playing lest you miss out on new gear or feeling "left behind". They're Intentionally preying on that fear &amp; discomfort by design.
---
If you're feeling overwhelmed &amp; fatigued just stop. For the sake of your own well being &amp; mental health. You're not losing anything meaningful. 
---
No game is worth it. Certainly not Bethesda by any means.
---
I agree and OMG I hated having to use emotes all the time. I made it through beta and he first week love before I said forget this and went and bought and inexpensive headset lol. Best $30 I ever spent.
---
Bloody mess in luck and adrenaline in agility are the big two that come to mind. Very good perks to invest in.
---
Find a good instigating rifle. I got an instigating railway. Not very sneaky but with the standard rifleman perks and gunfu just lvl one and adrenaline before it was broken let me wreck mobs. I‚Äôm a junky. I can‚Äôt put up bloodied numbers but I‚Äôm satisfied with my build.
---
I should be getting it soon, I lost track of the XP but I should be getting it by the time I hit level 30(Currently 28!)
---

---
you can force enemies to spawn in certain places
---
Just buff the other prefixes mutants,assassins etc. Basically all the useless ones so we can have more variety in our builds
---
It happens, but it‚Äôs the only time you‚Äôll get screwed, the workshop loss. When you are nuking areas to farm whatever you need, and are able to farm and log out and hop back in again over and over to reap (respawned) resources with no other players to contend with, you‚Äôll forget about the only time you really get effed (by workshop losses). Benefits far far far outweigh the once now and then crapola. 
---
No longer showing up to find things you are looking for picked over at schools, lead mines, etc..check. Repeated XP farming of west tek, or anywhere else, jumping out an back in again to find 50 fresh XP mutants to cleanse..check. Your own portable pup tent with scrap stash bed banjo and stove pretty much anywhere and anytime you need..check. Benefits of FO1 and the private world when you want it can be pretty ridiculous. Sorry you got hosed.
---
As far as I've seen, the npcs have some vendetta against the turrets and just get into fights with them.  I do appreciate having an explosive buddy to draw some aggro though.
---
Exploit I guess. Its been around a while. All someone has to do is place their tent where the mobs usually spawn which spawn blocks them and causes them to all spawn together right in front of you.
---
If you put your tent down on a spawn then they all drop in like that
---
That's really nice. Thanks. We're troopers. üòÇ
---
Glad you are enjoying it. It has improved even though there are still issues like yet another dupe.
---
The community makes the game. That's why I stick around.
---
Sure I'll hop on. Gt XOddxManxOutx
---
Honestly though, even if its just some new cosmetic plans to add to the queen/encryptid or PP, just add something new to them to give us a reason to repeat it at this point.
---
Instead of adding EVERYTHING to the atom shop, chuck some of the plans for cosmetic stuff to the loot pool of the queen between new content being added.
---
After endless modules, I have yet to see a 3* SS piece. Made me stop playing tbh. Atleast that account.
---
If a player with fallout 1st puts their tent on a specific spot on the road beyond the gates, it bugs the spawn point and they all spawn by the generator.
---
Why am I not surprised.
---
Ok. I did notice their tent up. Makes sense. Haven't seen it before. Thanks
---
If the supposed food/water debuff is getting removed then why do this?
---
No prob
---
Did you take pieces out of the frame before you jumped in? Been at this for a while and wanna make sure I‚Äôm doing it right
---
Been through about 20 frames at this point... am I missing something?
---
I'm not gonna stop playing over it. It's not the worst thing that's happened in this game for sure.
---
Placing the tent outside the building on the street cancels the original spawn points, so scorched rains inside. It's funny.
---
I have to spam X just to get anything out of my inventory then I end up taking a bunch of shit I don‚Äôt even need cause it‚Äôs so laggy
---
It honestly wouldn't be bad if it didn't have that stupid as hell requirement of keeping all 3 alive to get the good stuff, I think that is the reason people don't play it :/
---
Takes all your caps, breaks your game, automatically orders 10 new copies that also don't work.
---
I wish there was a way to see nuclear winter exp, period. That mode is so annoying that you get literally no information. You can't see how close you are to ranking up until you finish a match, you don't even get the exp bar in your pip boy. And they never give you an exact number, only a weird bar that has an arrow for absolutely no reason. What's the point of telling you that you got exactly 327 exp for that match when you can't see how much you need for your next level? And why do you need to search for a match and get into a lobby just to look at your perk cards?
---
Honestly, I'd like to have home made coffee more.
---
For a rifle build, Instigating is definitely the best prefix for your "sniper rifle". Doubles damage on the first shot, so when combined with sneak bonuses, Rifleman perks, and Covert Operative, you're popping heads. I usually do around ~1400 per head shot, and I only have the first rank of each Rifleman perk slotted. 
---
Secondary/tertiary weapon prefixes have some flexibility. Personally, I like +crit buffs on my sniper weapon, as it already does significant per-shot crit damage that is made even higher by the prefix. +stat bonuses are fine. Most of the rest are disposable; faster fire rate on a sniper rifle is useless, +damage resist is useless, etc. Reduced VATS cost isn't bad, but it'll be far more useful on an automatic weapon. (Although it's still useful.)
---
Also, I noticed you mentioned you don't slot Tank Killer or Bloody Mess. I *highly* recommend you slot both at max rank; Tank Killer is a significant damage buff against any armored opponent (and by "armored" I mean "it has Damage Reduction", which is almost everything), and Bloody Mess is a flat 15% damage buff that in my mind should be fit into every build.
---
For your back-up weapon, something like Furious or Anti-Armor (or Vampire's) is a good prefix. I actually use an automatic rifle for my CBQ weapon, although you can also use a semi-auto for the better Rifleman synergy.
---
They don‚Äôt take much in my experience.
---
I have three cabins, 5 water purifiers, a water wheel, a bunch of crops, a bunch of turrets on the back half of pickup trucks (free states), a grain silo, and a bunch of other stuff.
---
I also have enough camp space to build one of the new train carts but I have nowhere to put it except floating it in the air...which I don‚Äôt want to.
---
I don‚Äôt use any space glitches either
---
Turning on my Xbox now!
---
The win8 compat mode is an interesting idea, I'll give that a try, thanks!
---
Many beta players like myself who stuck through do it for many reasons but we shouldn't do it if we didn't have a genuine interest in the game. I am somewhere in the 400s level wise and I'm still enjoying it. I enjoy the grind. The story. Some players. Those who have contributed to the knowledge base are great player. Even hackers exploiters etc I appreciate; it's.aleays good to stress a system and point out it's flaws. But what I'll never ever agree to is coming on here, bashing developers, defecating all over others because they enjoy the game, buy atoms, pay for first, etc. We all have this mentality that we want it to be as good as it can be. Some want it to fail.
---
Weird then that it just started happening to my game yesterday. Been playing hard since about a week or two before wastelanders dropped and it wasn't broken up till yesterday for me.
---
I have full set 3*Vanguard, Unyielding and now just left leg needed on Bolstering set, takes many modules but can be done :-)
---
Oh it's on, good sir, kiiiind sir!
---
Did you look on YouTube?
---
My furious explosive railway rifle oh am I glad I never got rid of it and got the automatic plan and those shots on a Queen is so nice. I ended up hating all my ammo in a couple days because the vats was destroying everything
---
I like this idea, I know lots of people don't like running them or find them hard or laborious. 
---
If you're on PC hit me up sometime I'll help you run one.
---
Let's make things even easier for them
---
And you don't need need to invade Saudi Arabia to have oil for fuel crafting.
---
Yeeeaaaahhhh
---
I don't see anything. Did you use that new chat thing? The RIF app doesn't support that unfortunately.
---
I did. Don't see anything. But thanks to whoever down voted me üôÑ
---
Which guass you mean
---
imo, they shoulda really just sunk money into a new solo game instead of the mess that FO76 is
---
Radiation Emitter and Rad barrel plans exist:-)
---
Right!? PC here and same story.
---
I don't think anyone mentioned concentrated fire it's a must for me with using vats almost always it allows targeting of limb. Headshots
---
I travel light and use the refrigerated backpack mod. Food is sometime I always have.
---
flamer needs fuel and gatling plasma need plasma cores. plasma cores are easier to get. the plasma has a better fire rate and the plasma looks cooler.
---
Also, starting next week, some form of currency can be used to advance 1 space at a time. Im not exactly sure as to WHICH currency will be used, but theres that at least! 
---
Not saying you SHOULD use whatever currency to level up, but that option will be there should you ever desire to use it!
---
Use a radiation barrel or emitter
---
I fixed that!
---
They did. They broke the adrenaline perk
---
Yes but the rad barrel is quite slow and doesn‚Äôt the radiation emitter break after a few uses?
---
Sometimes I come across skeletons in situations that make me a little melancholy. Like there's one in a dress under a tree with all the layout for a picnic, with a baby carriage nearby. I don't like to disturb that scene so I usually move along
---
I would assume Gauss Rifle because, 5 months ago, the other Gauss weapons weren't there yet.
---
üòÅ
---
Its not broken.
---
The acid damage was nerfed into the ground because the devs are useless
---
True true.  Perks o listed are also helpful.  Wasnt trying to correct.  Just trying to be specific.  I forgot about scrounger.
---
Jus admit it-you‚Äôre an anarchist
---
Lol I never even read the age of the post
---
Paid 10k caps for mine. I've only seen it for sale a handful of times, and never below 10k in price.
---
No.
---
You can‚Äôt cross platforms.
---
For adventure too?
---
Always thought that was a pretty cool area they could use for an event or something, such a waste.
---
Suffice it to say, that legacy weapon is likely duped.  The dupers have been seeding train stations with them to try to spread the blame so Bethesda doesn't ban them.
---
Exactly. Which is odd considering the amount of sleeping bag skins (some of which are pretty cool) they've had in the atom shop since the game came out. Like... "Hey there, wanna give us some atoms so you can contract rad worms and dysentery? üôÉ"
---
35 but haven't logged in yet today. Stupid job.
---
Fucking RIP to us collectors smh...
---
Neither are daily "to do" lists.
---
I'd prefer to have 1, 2, and 3 star modules, personally.  And then to have this system apply as an option to all weapon/armor crafts.  Want a Light Leather Left Arm specifically?  Spend a Legendary Module and craft one.
---
I insta kill his gold plated arse....
---
There is also the lovers embrace buff
---
Can confirm.
---
Nope!
---
I have only met insult bot once, and the insult I got was "I have the greatest insult made up for you, but your tiny brain wouldn't understand it"
---
If you‚Äôve still got an extra I‚Äôve been looking for one... IGN is Bane_Majik
---
No doubt, ammosmith + super duper is the absolute best way to keep full on ammo, there's no denying that. Scrounger is good early on when you don't have access to those, though. But once you're level 50+ and have super duper, there's not much reason for scrounger anymore.
---
Capture gallery
---
Yea it took awhile for me I think it has something to do if you have rads best thing to do is keep trying to fast travel or move away from the spot and fast travel
---
That helps a lot. Thank you! I'll definitely do that.
---
How much for the fixer plans?
---
I used that perks once. I'll definitely reconsider it. Thank you.
---
Just want XP buff
---
For the most efficient completion, you basically need 3 runners, because each runner collects 30-40 ore.
---
I believe the ore does slowly respawn over the course of the event, but never at a rate that allows one person to do it all.  And the ore is specific to that person - others can loot the ore you've already taken, even if you can't.
---
Happens on PC too. I don't quiet understand it myself. However the buff is good for you regardless of what they do. I was all about the event buff but I like doing the build team now for the in-between stuff.
---
Well. First, I'm at half stash weight. If the damn list has 3 items it still lags to shit. It did it out the vault. Some patches ago, it didn't do it. It lags on crafting one item. They're obviously using tcp/ip in their programming. Every bit of scrolling checks the item server-side, per item. That's what it seems like from my own programming background.
---
Second, it's a mere listing of data. By your logic, a fatman in the stash lags more than say a pistol. Silly, right? Do you realize the amount of data that can be processed by your gaming rig &amp; high speed net? The items in my stash are not affecting my normal adventuring, even at full stash. Your carried items are only processed if they're equipped. Other than walking damn slow, I'll lug 1000 carry weight halfway across the map, no ill affect.
---
Now there's the hook, that'd be neat
---
Enjoy. Any chance you have another deathclaw mask you'd be willing to sell?
---
armour first IMO
---
For my experience, a lot people seem to think they'll get more xp regardless of if they do events.
---
Also fair to mention some people want the perks people share.
---
even though it‚Äôs still through xbox?
---
The jetpack is pretty amazing.
---
I get that for building's INT buff. But if you're in an events team, and not doing events, there is no gain.
---
I was doing an event and got hungry. I ate a ghoul next to a girl and she started punching me. I do not feel bad one bit.
---
I would be all in for an Automatic version
---
So the rng for a full set of ss armour (matching) is 15550 years! See fair or possible?
---
Xbox to Xbox will work, but I don‚Äôt think atoms transfer.
---
Get the jetpack. It‚Äôs amazing and as game changing as marsupial is to standard. Resistances don‚Äôt really matter than much past a certain point, it‚Äôs all about the legendary modifiers for your build.
---
And you can‚Äôt beat mobility or my favourite game of ‚Äúcan i time these jetpack bursts well enough so I don‚Äôt splatter off the top of Tanagra town‚Äù
---
I switched to an alt lately for the daily scrip weapon sale, and even with marsupial it‚Äôs like being crippled compared to the jetpack. Awful.
---
Once you get the jetpack you will probably not be able to live without it again, at least that is the case with me; it's far too fun!
---
üòâ
---
Legacy means a weapon is no longer available. 
---
Legendary means... if has 1-3 stars of legendary effects.
---
not what i meant. never mind.
---
U can get a full set easy
---
Rank 37 and only about 150 off from 38.
---
People are dumb and/or don't realise that :-)
---
We are going to get really screwed on these Legendary Perks.
---
Just lower ur standards. If u only want unyielding then good luck to you
---
Is this true? Would certainly like to try the SCORE rank on console (without 3rd party software) but am afraid of the consequences lol.
---
Insult Bot blanked me. Ignored. Walked by like I wasn‚Äôt there.
---
Beautiful at every size!
---
No but I do have a Raven
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I just re-spec‚Äôd to a rifle/shotgun build partially to escape the low-damage trap that I was in with my rifleman build. 
---
I think what others may tell you is that you just need a better gun. That‚Äôs what I was told when I asked the same question. If you get an explosive rifle you can take advantage of the explosive dmg bonus perk cards. If you get instigating you deal way more damage on your first shot. If you have addictions, you deal more damage with a junkies rifle, etc. My problem is I just can‚Äôt find a gun that‚Äôs good enough. 
---
I now run a rifle/shotgun build, not bloodied or junkie or anything like that. You can see my perk loadout here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bf235e6&amp;d=pd2pk2pl2pp2pc1p00eh1cu2ic4as2a02a72ar2ao0an0lt2l71li0sd2so2sp2su1&amp;m=5cf&amp;n=Rifleman%2FShotgunner
---
So far I‚Äôm loving it. When I‚Äôm hidden and far enough away I can shred enemies with my Covert Operative + Adrenaline perks (and Rifleman + Tank Killer of course). Then when a few tougher enemies get close I pull out my shotty and make quick work of them with my Shotgunner, Scattershot and Enforcer perks. And the whole time I‚Äôm banking 15% bonus damage with Bloody Mess. 
---
Once a scorchbeast lands (not the SBQ but a regular one) I can take most of its health with just a few shotgun blasts. That would have taken a few clips with my handmade  
---
Main problem with this build is that it spares no room for weight reduction perks nor very much in the way of defense. For that I rely on a full set of buttressed deep pocketed SS armor, a high capacity backpack and the marsupial mutation.
---
That's interesting cause I'm currently running a melee builds with a bunch of mutations I managed to get one being marsupial alongside speed demon which I absolutely love
---
My fave new toy is the be gatling plasma
---
Ah lul, didnt check the name, thank you in that case. :)
---
Yes a full set is easy but what toy want is nigh-on impossible!
---
You have a point there. Although I have noticed that I've joined more than a few teams where not a single other person is sharing. Even players that are clearly nowhere near being new to the game. For instance, the level 210 that I'm currently on a public team is not sharing a perk.
---
Don't open new perk card packs if you are a high level.
---
It all you can find is a two shot lever action that should help till you find the instigating.
---
Stop fast traveling. Stop spending money. 
---
Craft healing salves.
---
Use melee weapons.
---
Heck, I live on the opposite side of the continent and most small town families here can with jars.
---
I still have a bunch of jars of wild blackberry jam, salmon and smoked trout in my pantry.
---
Loot morgantown airport for stimpacks, disease cures, and other aid items.
---
Radiation Barrels
---
For defense, I have the T-65 PA. I might have to get rid of it for regular armor.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this but I try to be clear when I show up and heart or wave. I‚Äôm lvl 230.
---
How many you want? Do you already know it?
---
Bummer. Only one I need is DC. Thanks
---
It‚Äôs not instanced so I am assuming enemies respawn
---
I went through this period. Then I started getting more strategic with making ammo, cooking, etc., and it got better. Vending helps, too! You can get caps to buy cheap ammo in a pinch. It‚Äôs also good to have a few weapons to switch among. You‚Äôll get there!
---
Hell of a ride ngl
---
I must be blind because I didn't see where to buy the levels.  Granted I didn't look very hard either.
---
Yup and add Tenderizer under Charisma, for even more damage. If you find an explosive version of your weapon, add Demolition Expert.
---
Cave crickets hands down .
---
Lovers embrace, hp, waiting for folks to be done in my camp, gotta go piss, etc.
---
Really? I didn't know this was possible. Got a pic?
---
Maybe that was the insult üòÇ
---
Pretty much this right here.  This sub and YouTube right after teams were announce proclaimed that the events teams would be the most OP because of the 100 percent XP boost. 
---
A bunch of people seem to have heard that and failed to understand the XP came from doing PUBLIC events.
---
Original acid did 50 points of damage over x seconds, but stacked infinity. Now it does 100 in x seconds but only 1 stack at a time. It's ok but not great.
---
I would assume so...
---
If the ammo converter allowed me to say, dump all of the ammo I wanted converted into you know THE ANIMATED HOPPER THEY PUT AND WASTED TIME ON, then we'd be somewhat okay.
---
But to have to sit there and mash enter forever....
---
I think they're in league with keyboard makers to increase sale of keyboards.....
---
They have to have at least 3 CHR to share a 1* perk card. Not a lot of folks carry a ton of charisma. Might be the reason.

Another option is a gamma gun and shoot at you feet
---
I don‚Äôt go out of my way to find ingredients, but I usually find enough to be able to make the more advanced recipes every day. I end up giving a lot of food away. I basically learn as many recipes as I can, so I can make something cool with what I‚Äôve got.
---
I might‚Äôve, do you just want me to give you my gt and we could message on xbox?
---
People would just use it for Target Practice or find another humiliating thing to do with it! lmao!
---
Alright guess My base will have to stay still for a while. Thanks for the info!
---
I have yet to be in a group with enough people to actually complete the event. It's ridiculous. One time I started it and a second person joined just as the timer ran out. No one wants to do it.
---
Ok ,I like how that sounds now, would love to try something more minimalist , I kinda made a image of camp budget I would use than. Thank you for the nice insight on the cabin space budget. Will have to wait for it to appear on atom shop. Take care.
---
My Ally gifted me a Bloodied Explosive Handmade. I don't do Bloodied so I stuck it in my vendor for 10k caps. It disappeared fairly quickly and I hope it made someone tear up similarly. I don't need more caps than that.
---
Congrats on the new weapon. Who cares of its provenance.
---
I just unlocked the Raider Cage Tree.
---
Damnit... Have an updoot.
---
If you only play the game in game, and only trade in game... you probably wouldn‚Äôt even notice.
---
Heavy
---
It will be a free item in the atomic shop once they release it. Should be soon!
---
My first try created a Regenrating Secret Service Chest piece with +1 Agility after grinding a month for it, followed by a chameleon with 1 Agility.
---
I would imagine that‚Äôs part of the point. Major league farming that weekend so I can take some days off the grind later on. I just hit 42 and the grind is now becoming very evident. Already twice the amount to level as the start.
---
Yep me too!
---
This.  I went looking for it and was confused af
---
Yeah, as stated above, my rifle has a Two-Shot. I was under the impression that it'd do an impressive amount of damage like in FO4 but I was very wrong. Thanks.
---
Yep.
---
Heavy. Also a super heavy at eating ammo.
---
It heals you also
---
Sounds like someone is a bit on the testy side about having another camp at the same location as theirs....and does not want to say yes when notified ‚Äúcamp cant be placed, find anther world?‚Äù  question.....
---
Set pacifist, block for session, and ignore the player.
---
That‚Äôs what it sounds like
---
Gun Fu and Adrenaline Agility perks really up the damage for rifles. Also 3Star your Bloody Mess for any and all builds outside the Forest
---
‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be nice‚Äù and the covers of ‚ÄúRing of Fire‚Äù and ‚ÄúTake me home, country roads‚Äù really take me out of it. Everything else I think is very well suited especially ‚Äúsixteen tons‚Äù
---
This. This right here. Every duper I've ever came across doesn't do it for money. They do it to help their friends out.
---
I'm finding my jffr mini actually takes forever to break now
---
That works.
---
I have the Xbox, but it is the same for this problem, delete the game and the saving and all you can delete, you have a disc problem, a broken file on the disk
---
I accidentally took my mod my BSS instantly regretted
---
My GT is SubjxctDxlta

I would use regular armor..

IMO the type you choose is not as important as what legendary effects the pieces have on them.. YMMV

I do a Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman [LIKE THIS](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b455be&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0an0ar0p00sv0sb0lk2lb0cu0&amp;w=p80p90ij2i42iq2pa0lm0at0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0c52&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d)

Whats your platform and what are you looking for?  (I‚Äôm PS4.)  I have a number of PA plans in my vendor.  Right now...t45 and 51, but I have others, plus mods.
---
Level 35 here, had a level 300 plus contest my workshop and he continued to kill me until I had no caps left as my camp was beside the workshop, him and his friends proceeded to take over every workshop in the server killing all the owners and then just sat in their camps. Almost gave up on the game at that point.
---
I believe in you though you can get that set
---
It hasn't left my PS4 SINCE Wastelanders. I have cleaned it and it's still doing it
---
Nope. Blow as many away as you wish. No consequences.
---
Agreed.
---
They are good for exp too haha
---
Thank you, I almost lost my mind because I‚Äôm close to finishing cautious and I thought it lowered.
---
Bro I got u. What‚Äôs ur psn name?
---
That's just lazy. Frist time I launched a nuke, I was a level 47, solo. Now, 179, I do it solo in about 10 min. It's very easy to do once you learned the route. Nothing special but still feels nice to do it.
---
Demolition expert in intelligence
---
It's so dumb you can kill them even though your allies with them without them turning against you and loosing reputation but that's the way it is so might as well get the XP

I was expecting a snarky comment from this but was pleasantly surprised. Thanks for the kind words!

Grenadier perk in Perception effects the radius.

I'll be on in about 2 hours maybe less

I only use one point in demo expert, it definitely helps but you don‚Äôt really need to dump that many points into it

It does, I just wanted to send OP on a voyage of discovery.

If you still need them and see me online, ping me.

GT: LAWRENCEANDHENR
---
I'll explain it simply. Every bethesda game uses the same id for same items. For example, the id of a duped item would be the same as one dropped by the purveyor, which in turn has the same id as the master copy in the dev room. Technically, every item in the game that can be picked up by the player is duped.
---
With that being said, there is no way to track, relatively speaking, whether an item has been duped or not. What CAN be tracked, is how many of said item has hit a players inventory. That's how they catch most dupers, the ones stupid enough to dupe 5 bazillion of the same thing in a short amount of time. 
---
TL:DR - you are perfectly safe accepting an item if it has been duped.
---
Exactly, so many people don't release the building team is much better for xp if you're not doing events. Its a tiny xp boost but its for everything.
---
How about dungeons with arenas to hold on with random objective.
---
bethesda makes that happen. 
---
go into vats come out and go in and you should hit or get used to missing
---
Holy shit, you didn't read a single word of the post you replied to. Why you yelling at people for things they didn't do? Seek comprehension help.
---
A topic came up, and I commented on it. It was only the biggest thing in the gaming industry for like a month. You might have missed it when you were off gaslighting someone else.
---
Three maps from the U-mine it vendor will give you enough.
---
What‚Äôs offering?
---
Add me. Duo86m
---
I feel like a little butterfly with the jetpack.  Highly recommended.  I'm still working on buying some of the leg/arm mods, but I think it was right to get jetpack earlier.
---
It's just wanabe Appalachian aka Settlers
---
Both
---
Haha.  Thats how i wanted to draw you guys in. All the best!
---
Lol, a bit overkill?
---
That is fair. Just speaking from my experience to be honest. I've found people are less likely to change teams if 2 people are sharing something.
---
Edit - also a lot of people (including high levels) don't know how to share perks or don't have the charisma.
---
Secret service is 15dr 15energy 15rad and +4 to strength/endurance and +2 perception
---
Secret service. I forget the name of mod but it adds 4 strength amongst other buffs.
---
Just one would be perfect because I dont yet lol
---
Lol I'm sorry are people still playing this game?
---
Gauss Rifle + VATS = miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, reload.  
---
Gauss Rifle w/o VATS = Boom.
---
But, yeas, what u/Rammadeus stated.  Sometimes you have to leave VATS to get VATS to work.
---
This is how I did mine.
---
Shielded Secret Service. 4 strength, 2 perception, 4 endurance, 15 DR, ER, and RR
---
As do I.
---
Thought this was just me with the bad luck, now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a bug. I too use a Gauss Rifle and this happens all the time, so frustrating!
---
Mission accomplished üëç
---
Ah good. That, the full health, sneaky build you have is what I want. Thank you.
---
XB1
---
Bloody Mess. Gotcha. Thank you.
---
Own category with it's own perks.
---
I believe they are their own catagory. Has its own perk
---
And how do I obtain this under armor with mods?
---
Dual Wielding pistols and riot shields.
---
Own category in the Strength perk line
---
No consequences. As good as Wastelanders is, this aspect is feeling pretty dumb. I usually let them be, as I had ally with both sides. Now though, those random raiders and settlers are worth SCORE. Now they all have to die.
---
The damn scout robots give you pemmican, why can't we make jerky? Or have a smoke shed?
---
Sorry to ask almost 3 weeks later, but I've been searching for this for days and your answer is the best I've found so far. 
---
So one question, do you know if the production rate is combined for all purifier sizes? Let's say I build 1 small and 1 industrial, would it be 72/hr, and the water is deposited into either purifiers inventory? If this is the case, you'd only really need 1 of each purifier size to max production rate, and any additional purifier (any size) increases storage. 
---
Hopefully I made sense there lol. I just started playing a couple weeks ago with my wife and noticed some odd things when comparing our water production rate, and that's the best explanation I can come up with lol
---
Nah man, sometimes everyone needs to dabble into the dark arts
---
There‚Äôs something about getting mobbed and staggered that just boils you isn‚Äôt there?
---
My unpopular opinion is that I liked it way before I could not give a f*** about the human NPC and they ridiculously bad written quests I couldn't care less about. I was free to explore this massive map and uncover its secrets. What killed it for me? No payoff to visit the prison and there was nothing to discover. The haunted church? A mistery you couldn't solve. The kidnapped boy? The interloper? Nah man we don't want you to investigate. Have a camera and take a picture of a pink deathclaw for 20 atoms while drunk on the moon.
---
And the weight limit. JC everytime it just so much bs
---
Depends on your build. SS underarmor is pretty good for basically anyone but if you're say a Bloodied commando road leathers are probably the best since it gives bonuses to PER, AGI, &amp; Luck I believe. I also find marine wetsuit really good since it makes you immunity to waterborne diseases which is pretty useful IMO
---
SS if you‚Äôre melee or unarmed. For any other build choose shielded raider under armor
---
Unyielding, Deathclaw steak +5 STR, carnivore mutation , Ribeye steak at 60+ additional carry weight (I think) and I'm already at 530 for maximum.
---
What the... does this sub look like r/confession to you?
---
"You and Todd could be twins."
---
Isn't that what we have Theodore Collins for?
---
I walked in, he was dead and I was being blamed for it. Tried redoing the mission a few times with the same outcome, so I just went with it.
---
ouch..
---
if you dont mind my asking.. why do you do that?
---
I dont upgrade any cards that are not in my build unless I need a card at 2 different levels for some reason.. for example I adventure with Gunsmith at 3* and like to have a 5* version for crafting so I had to make 2 to do that..
---
Sadly I can't build any of that.
---
I agree, I just think it would be great to show some love.
---
Need to out together a party with a private server. Then, even if you drop you can just rejoin team and you have people to help defend and collect together. Like running lucky mine and not having to leave to defend while going.
---
Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.
---
It just #works
---
I have a bunch of ammo, junk, some caps if you need. Random pieces of armor, nothing great
---
Same as myself, with carnivore mutation, rib eye steak &amp; deathclaws steak can easily get to 600 without carry weight perk cards.
---
I'd prefer a bunch taken out so the stupid Moleminer will stop giving me legendary versions.
---
Nah you are just spreading the will of Namira
---
So what u are saying is those songs are in the game
---
Thanks.
---
Btw great fuckin name
---
I know it‚Äôs much easier to level up this way. I finally got my sheepsquatch plushie that I‚Äôve been longing for, I immediately used up my whole budget to put 20 of them in my camp lol
---
Instead of copying the file every time you can just make a symbolic link to the file.
---
Credit to user bnlf I saw him post about this in another thread.
---
Open cmd prompt as admin and run this:
---
mklink "c:\Users\MyUser\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76"\Project76.ini "F:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps\Fallout 76\Project76.ini"
---
Replace MyUser with your Windows username and F:\ with the correct drive letter for your Install Path.
---
Check your settings
---
Yeah, that gold pocket watch is so worth it.
---
Build teams increase Intelligence, which has the effect of increasing XP for everything you do. 
---
I don't know about the trophy.
---
I don't care if people join and leave. Some people might.
---
Great guide. Is project.ini missing or what seems to be the cause of the issue?
---
I'm thinking since I cloak when sneaking, I might have surprised him.

One of nuka worlds strangest rides available.

I did an Messenger event yesterday that spawned 5 glowing Yao at each stop. I died so many damn times.
---
You need to complete the Wastelanders quests to gain access to the Secret Service then you need to obtain (aka grind) the required gold to buy the plans for it. Its not tradeable
---
Thank you! I hope you don't mind but I made a post with these instructions because this is the best way to fix this problem.
---
Idk why out of habit i guess to keep things clean
---
Regs in Vault 79. The under armor and the shielded mod total 450 bullion.
---
That sounds amazing
---
Have you ever done a west tek run ??? I dont care how good you are your not doing it in 3.5 mins and all my calculations dont account for loading screen time either so it be more like 2 mins per run. Even at 3.5 mins that's 1388 west tek runs in 81 hrs when there is only 96 hrs in the time you say he finished. So he slept a little over 3 hrs a day and didn't shower or use the bath room. Really??? You believe this??? I'm done arguing with you obviously your a gullible idiot.
---
It's the reason I stopped using it. I put up with it for about a month...but it drove me insane.
---
Yeah they‚Äôre on the game radio if that‚Äôs what you mean.
---
I already built a tower like that for two of my friends. Would have loved to build you one too, or at least give you a few ideas with mine =) Sry man.
---
No its not you, there have not been any new hairstyles in a good long while. Not sure about facepaints though.
---
Cool, what is your GT?
---
Most don't understand that events only buffs so for completing events... Building team buffs intelengence which gives XP for everything you do ..  this is the team they should join if they want to do something other than just events.
---
That event can be done just fine with one person if their brain isn't full of radworms. Cripple the ghouls, turn in the ore only once you have 100. Bring some AP boosters.
---
Now that is what I‚Äôm talking about. Love it.
---
We don‚Äôt know. However, there‚Äôs an entry in one of the Vault 51 terminals about a younger person named Freddy, and how they can‚Äôt believe someone did ‚Äúthat‚Äù to him. 
---
Could be pure coincidence, could be my memory playing tricks on me, or...could be that Freddy didn‚Äôt do too well in Vault 51.
---
I honestly can't tell. My weapons and armor never really break, but that's is likely because I run both Auto-Repair perks.
---
Actually, I shot him in the face with my .44 instead of hitting him. No regrets, I take no mercy on the scorched. What was she thinking?
---
It does count towards the trophy.
---
I am really tired of people that keep doing that. I tend to play alone since all my friends left the game, so I have to hop onto evens when I can and I have had my fair share of Asshats ruining things recently.
---
Occasionally I think back about how the game launched and discover how many things I take for granted. Not just regarding bugs or connection stability, but regarding the features... Thinking that back then there was no player vending, no way to earn legendaries beyond farming ghouls at Whitesprings, no way to tell if we already know a recipe/plan. Or I dread the thought that back then every faction had vendors with 200 caps only. Hitting the cap limit meant hopping all around the map...  
---
I'm sure as hell that noone will want to seriously play Fallout 76 Classic. WoW Classic has at least some positives that some people may enjoy, but I can't find anything such in original 76...
---
Also try scatter shot it's a perk card that tightens the spread.
---
I‚Äôve been debating this as well. If you‚Äôre going for straight up damage resistance then definitely secret service under armor with the shielded mod. On the other hand, shielded Raider under armor gives you less protection but the buffs to agility &amp; luck make it well worth the trade off for anyone other than melee builds. As a hybrid rifleman/shotgunner, raider leathers will be my under armor of choice once I finish building out my secret service armor set.
---
They really do! And more enemies to fight. It get so broing just walking through the woods with nothing to fight or do until the next event pops up!
---
33, I‚Äôve only missed 3 challenges so far and they were all NW cause I ran out of time or RL was busy.
---
Yeah and yikes  no wonder ppl always talk down on this game
---
Don't get too concerned about the type of team like build versus casual for instance. It's just a way to label the type of benefit the team gets.  You could join a team and never interact with them and that's fine.
---
I did nothing showed up so i restarted my game and now its workin
---
They talk down on this game because of the music?
---
Someone‚Äôs gotta be first though. Otherwise, the whole world is just waiting for someone else to make the first move, which def happens.
---
No accualy im not to sure why they do but all my bros talk shit abbout this game even tho they never played it
---
The best one ive gotten so far was "They say its whats on the inside that counts but the only thing inside of you is a lethal amount of radiation"
---
When you get the jetpack be sure to get a piece of armor with 50% less falling damage or even goat legs in the perk cards. It helps to prevent crashing to the ground and dying.
---
Thanks! It seems like the normal games .ini file is stored in Documents, while the gamepass version stores this file in the game directory, but the game code still looks for it in Documents.
---
It'd definitely make sense. A lot of people are talking about a BoS one, it will more than likely happen for Steel Dawn.
---
Go to event and stand so others can see you on map, don't start event.
---
I'd love one at my camp to test out dps
---
doesnt actually work
---
Is the SS armor set better then the others or it depends?
---
Hallow event is 14000 total xp, each rank counts towards the next. Xmas isnt.
---
Like the scorch that drop from the sky during the Fort Defiance event?
---
Hairstyles and facepaints are extremely rare additions, for some reason.  The ones that are there presently were pretty much around at launch, and we've only seen a handful, at most, since then.  Most notably, the Curly Bun which was released for free as part of Clean Appalachia last summer.
---
But like, even the Raiders in Crater are sporting unique facial tattoos.  So I have no idea why they are so rarely seen in the Atomic Shop.
---
Hair, perhaps a different story.  I'm not sure any of the new NPCs in Wastelanders even have new hairstyles, which is quite surprising.  Did they reach some kind of limit?  Does no one know how to make hair?  It's something of a mystery.  I'd love to have a set of dreadlocks, or a ponytail with some bangs in the front.
---
There aren't even any in the Battle Pass as rewards.
---
LOL @ everyone saying the Plasma has better fire rate. It's right there in the screenshots- Flamer has a fire rate of 91, plasma has the same (not sure why the one OP has is 82, maybe the splitter mod lowers fire rate?).
---
What it comes down to is that Splitter mod- massive AoE damage. The Plasma cores aspect doesn't hurt either- flamer fuel is much harder to come by.

Angry Turtle made an informative video about Public Teams. YouTube.
---
Personally, I consider kicking people who don't share at least one perk card as common etiquette.
---
Yeah agreed. I‚Äôm usually the first to arrive at those events. I hang around until the last second before I use the terminal or whatever to start the event. If nobody shows up, the clock runs out and I fail the event. But it‚Äôs better than starting it with 1-2 people which is a guaranteed failure and a waste of 15 minutes.
---
People need to understand that all of those events come with a VERY high probability of failure unless there are at least 4 people playing.
---
Ah right yeah, my gf is the same. The majority of people just let reviews and influencers make their opinions for them. Quite sad.
---
There's something weird going on with CAMP locations.  Yesterday I logged on, and got the 'Your CAMP could not be placed...' message.  I was considering moving it anyway so I accepted.  I coincidentally started at my CAMP location - which was completely empty!  No other player was there, and neither was my CAMP.
---
Angry Turtle makes videos on youtube that are very informative. He explains why certain things are better than others rather than just telling you what to use. There is a lot of nuance in a lot of peoples builds and many ways to go about dominating NPCs. I highly suggest checking some out, you will improve your fundamental understanding of mechanics, in turn making you more effective and making the game even more fun. 
---
He also has videos on specific builds and probably has one laying out just how to do what you want with what you have. 
---
Im not affiliated with Angry Turtle, just really benefited from his information.
---
Where did you find your chassis and how did you claim it? Did you just enter a random spawned one and drop the pieces from your inventory? I can‚Äôt seem to get this to work for me, any help would be appreciated
---
Are you running in borderless window mode? I found the game had terrible frame rate until I set it to full screen instead.
---
Instead of sharing with the factions? Why?
---
I don't know anything about sharing perks, never joined a team at all untill recently. I am sharing some perk card, but like, maybe I could be sharing something better? I just pressed triangle (on PS4) untill it worked on one
---
Yeah but there‚Äôs a timer. Top right corner. There‚Äôs no need to rush to start it ASAP if no one else is around.
---
Once you can purchase items from the gold vault you will wish you had the extra gold bars. The items there are very expensive. Keeping them really doesn't affect how the game is played.
---
Ok so I'm a bloodied commando build someone daid the raider one is the way to go what do u think?
---
Thank you.
---
This.
---
Source?
---
I think it‚Äôs widely accepted that SS armor is the best in the game except in certain specific cases. Like if you‚Äôre strictly melee PvP maybe thorn armor is better, or something like that?
---
But the fact that SS armor is so balanced between damage, energy and rad resistance makes it a fantastic general purpose armor set. Even better if you roll the right legendary perks when you craft it. Even better still once you apply mods like Buttressed.
---
I agree with the OP, I played during the B.E.T.A and had some fun. I had high hopes for the game that sadly came crashing down and I left. I have recently returned and just hit level 60 on my main and I have been loving all the changes they implemented. I can see the effort that the Devs have put in to making this game a great fallout game and I have hopes for future content.
---
Why couldn't they copy/rename the effect of the Ultra-Light modification for armor and have that become the new "Weightless"? Ultra-Light applies regardless of how modded your armor is, and currently stacks with Weightless (I have a piece of Weightless Ultra-Light combat armor that weighs 0).
---
We don't really disagree on many of your points. 
---
For players, from both of my groupings, reaching and spending time in the end game, no doubt tires and gets repetitive quickly, and players in that stage are thirsty for more compelling, challenging and rewarding content. Understandable. 
---
My comment was mostly geared at the fact that a player with 3 month's experience is now finding the game to be a chore. 
---
There's a reason I'm indulgent on the #2 player type. It's because group 1? They experience much less of the game in a rush to finish and to start grinding. They hurry past a pretty expansive landscape dotted with 100's of little stories, then complain when they suddenly arrive at the grind. 
---
Even your mention of terminals and notes misses the point. There's a ton of locations with little stories and mysteries all over the 76 map. Little scenes to explore and suss out. There's a plethora of exploration in 76 that doesn't focus on the grind, loot or min/maxing, that aren't a blatant quest, that many many players never see. 
---
I can promise you that there is a boat load of end game players, sick of the grind, that haven't seen a metric ton of things player type #2 has. 
---
If you're a classic ES/FO explorer? Who likes to explore every little nook and cranny? There's an absolute ton in 76. 
---
Group 1) Gets bored far more quickly and experiences much less of the game. 
---
Group 2) Hits chore phase much later.  Experiences more of the setting.
---
Ohhh that would be awesome!! Some patched up leather jackets, broken vehicles for camps. Bus, trailer and van prefabs? üíû
---
&gt; I‚Äôve been playing this game forever. I wish I could relive those days. 
---
Mee too, man. But sadly, that won't happen unless someone wiped out memory about this game. Even if we got our hands on the original game, we cannot relive the sense of wonder and exploration.
---
This is where WoW Classic tried it and failed as well for many players. Sure, there are some who enjoy the Classic content, but many have left because they cannot relive their past and finally realized that.
---
Dog Food Processor .... I‚Äôm in.

It's 'you're* a gullible idiot' not 'your a gullible idiot'. If you're gonna insult me like a child you should at least do it properly. Clownshoe.
---
So far, it seems like people are mostly using the public teams to complete the daily/weekly season challenges. I haven't had more than one other team member participate in the same event as me, and nobody cared. (Or if they did, their mic was off.)
---
The team type just determines which bonus you get.
---
Definitely. Whether it is season 2 or 3, Brotherhood/military will come soon. Enclave stuff would be cool too. 
---
Do you think the whole BOS line will be just building up the BOS or a BOS vs Enclave?
---
They are literally the same thing with different values. Ultra-light is a flat number decrease, weightless is a flat number decrease. That is the only reason you are able to get negative (0) weight by combining them
---
Restarting did the trick. Thank you everyone.
---
Drop iron clad/evasive if your DR is about 250 without them equiped.   Switch evasive with covert operative. 
---
Grim reapers sprint in luck is amazing if you use vats alot.

Otherwise solid build.

Yup, been like this since wastelanders on all platforms as far as I know. I‚Äôm on Xbox.

Agreed, let me just wipe the rabid foam from my mouth first

Yeah it can be.  My buddy and I do it all the time.

Junkies build here. I have crafted over 210 pieces of Secret Service armor looking for vanguard and unyielding. That‚Äôs not counting the Super Duper procs. I have saved exactly 4 pieces. It‚Äôs just sad.
---
Ps4 missing the arms for ultracite armor and only have excavator. Would like to pick up raider etc
---
It‚Äôs been more common, just keep sending reports. Hopefully they bless us with a real fix instead of the last patch they did, I run PS4 as well and I had to reinitialize the whole system and reinstall everything.
---
Thankfully your account is linked to Beth, but any favorited emotes, etc you‚Äôll have to refavorite.
---
For an end game commando build, you may want to work on increasing your Luck. Along with VATs, cards like Grim Reapers Spirit, Critical Savy, and Better Criticals work wonders on all creatures, including the SBQ. With a Bloodied build, Serendipity will also be needed, adding to the need for higher Luck.
---
I normally load into adventure, walk about or do whatever for about five minutes, then check the dailies. I dont know if it has anything to do with it, but keeping this routine i haven't had it happen but the one time I didnt do this.
---
Yes it is!
---
the core items are bloodied gun/adrenaline serum , if youre at 20%hp those 2 items will give u total of 160%+ to damage , if u combine it with gun perks + stealth, u ll be one tapping everything except bosses or mini bosses. Almost forgot, 2shot guns are the worst one for rifles , even for combat rifle, the second bullet isl ike 50% of the dmg and from distance you mostly hit ONLY the second bullet, also it has damage drop on distance and u ll hit someone like for 50dmg
---
Something similar happened to me. I never actually went to where my camp would of been, but I looked on the map and there was no camp there. I just though they must of logged out as I joined.
---
Got me where it hurts.
---
Like my quad explosive harpoon gun that I received in a trade months back and have never used or desired to use...
---
I've been playing since BETA and I can say without a doubt in my mind, duping is not nearly as big a problem as people care to admit.
---
Chances are I get downvoted but here's my reasoning.
---
This game relies *too* much on RNG. Go to the purveyor, kill a legendary enemy. Have a chance to get the weapon you want. Another chance to get the prefix you want. And another chance to get the secondary, and yet another chance to get the last perk. Not to mention that three star enemy has a chance of dropping a one or two star legendary too.
---
So odds are you'll give up actually trying the fight the RNG Gods who laugh at you. So you go to buy it, but wait. The gun you want is good. Like very good. But also very rare. The game only has a 30,000 cap limit for some reason, yet wants to focus on caps as the main currency. The trading system wasn't made for trading item for item, but item for caps and caps for items.
---
So in order to get that bloodied fixer, you better have some good legendaries to tra- oh wait, here comes more unnecessary RNG again to trade for the weapon. But odds are, the person will want a legacy item that can't be obtained anymore. Not to mention the risk of getting scammed of him just taking your items and running since the trade system wasn't designed for item for item trade.
---
So here's where dupers come in. They dupe the items everyone wants. Rarity goes down, sure they're still pricey, but the duper has nothing to lose. He'll sell it to you for 15,000 caps because that's all profit to him since he has a stash full of them. Have an old wildly duped TSE Handmade? He might trade you the bloodied fixer for it, chances are he won't scam you cause he has a chest full of fixers.
---
While I would never dupe, since I value my account too much, I think they are critical to this games very, very bad economy. It wouldn't be so bad, if there wasn't a cap and timegate for everything. Only get 150 scrip a day, that's three 3* legendaries every two days for a chance, of a chance, of a chance, of a chance of the item you want. Only 30,000 caps max, that means amazing weapons will NEVER be sold for THE CURRENCY the game "relies" on. Max caps should be more like 300,000. Dupers stabilize an unbalanced economy that has too many hard limits
---
Sweet greatly appreciate it man!

I accidentally killed the insult bot yesterday. We were exploring an creepy cave. No music on, just letting the eerie world sounds add to the fear factor. As I moved through the darkness I heard ‚Äútarget acquired‚Äù behind me. I spun and opened fire. He went down before I even realized what I had hit. Didn‚Äôt even get to deliver his insult. 
---
I am so incredibly ashamed.
---
If I had a fucking dollar.. why are you in this sub?!?
---
People don‚Äôt go to that event. When it‚Äôs up I just go for a quick level and a half. And I hold the inside until the end myself. So it can be done duo.
---
Factssssssssss
---
Much to learn, you have.
---
Wow 5k thx thoüëçüèª
---
For a commando the roadleathers are definitely the best to my knowledge. Since the few points of resistance you get from underarmor is pretty irrelevant (+15 DR,ER,RR on SS) the most important part is the special bonuses and with shielded roadleathers you get +3 to perception &amp; agility &amp; +1 luck
---
[This](https://imgur.com/gallery/3bqrUTv) was my ultimate favorite and even Lady D commented on my filthy casual post about it.
---
Goes along the lines of him becoming sentient and realizing we all attack him and then he upgraded and got that new shiny paint
---
Trust me, no you don't. The game is better now, far from perfect, but it's had a rough, and I mean ROUGH first year. Wastelanders made it the perfect time to start playing. Anything before that, you'd swear it was still in BETA
---
Agreed. You could probably spare a few points from endurance and agility for things like ironclad and evasive. Just get a good set of armor and you won‚Äôt have much trouble. If you do have trouble in a good set of armor, those perks probably wouldn‚Äôt have saved you anyway. 
---
There are some great perks in Luck that make combat a lot more pleasant.
---
I think I might have just made that up, but that's me and the wife. Can't be the only ones out there though.
---
That document doesn't look right. You say XP needed. Its score needed. If you just needed 200k XP to get to spot 100 we would all be done.
---
Luck 7 of the 9 auto completed for me and I have never had that bug
---
You still have one?
---
Great idea but you lost me with needing 5 steps. This game doesn't need more clunky mechanics.   
---
Let me drop a can, antiseptic, and raw foods into a machine and have it poop out a canned good.   
---
The interface could be just like the regular cooking/brewing one - just scroll down and any items eligible to be made are highlighted and produced with one click of a button.
---
No one seems to care much if you come and go, talk or don't, whatever. The only exception I'd say is if I'm playing with my usual crew of 3 and a 4th buddy of ours shows up we'll kick the random. Nothing personal.
---
I was doing mostly Events teams since we spam the server with SBQs but Building seems to be where it's at since, as someone else said, INT ups all XP not just Event XP. You don't have to do Events together to benefit, once you max out you get the bonus for Events **you** complete.
---
Of the random teams I've done or jumped into, it seems like most people just do their own thing. Enjoy the bonus, maybe make some new friends... seems to be the best of both worlds for players whether they prefer teaming up or running solo.
---
You need to have 3 charisma per rank on a perk card. 
---
It only benefits the other team members however. Plus most people will use the cards they need. So perks like lockpick, travel again and so on tend to be beat to share. Unless you are in a party or something with someone. Then you can share perks knowing they don't have it on.
---
Ok and now for the million dollar question lol where can I get these plans for the roadlethers and mods for it?
---
I heard you got drunk and missed exiting Vault 76 on time. Too bad you didn't do the same thing before entering it!
---
not at the minute. I had a good run of finding the rare responder vendor and was able to grab 5 or 6 plus some of the other rare uniforms
---
why would you back out?
---
EDIT: Bug. Got it. Ta.
---
I have been trying get him to spawn took me 26 sever jumps still nothing
---
Project paradise can be easily done solo, not all 3 friendly animals, but you can definitely do it alone for 1.  
---
The problem i have with it is that even when there are 7-8+ people they still stuck in one room and they don't go to save all 3 animals for maximum rewards, since it is not very clear ingame.
---
Thanks, mate.
---
I would love to know your secret then. That alpha boss would stomp me if I didn‚Äôt have backup.
---
My quad, FFR pump shotgun makes them bearable (get it?)...but it took my head being on a constant swivel.
---
It was easier to do both events as my bloody stealth commando though...so much faster kill rate whereas shotguns are slower.
---
Just get some toxic goo
---
You‚Äôve got issues
---
If you die before right before the SS, the game freezes and won‚Äôt let you respawn
---
Because you can‚Äôt respawn if you die just before the event you ends
---
Yeah... you‚Äôre going to need to step away. This is a problem. It can easily spiral into much bigger issues from here.
---
Honestly, though. You need to step back and reevaluate.
---
I think s/he had the bug where if you die and then the event completes you are unable to respawn and the camera just keeps circling your body.
---
"Fallout76.ini" is not in the folder, would there be a reason for this?
---
Still hoping for a lot of Fallout classics: G11, Bowzar, Pancor Jackhammer, Service Rifle, Anti-Materiel Rifle, 14mm pistol, 223 pistol(That Gun), Sniper Rifle,etc.
---
Keep an eye on the Imposter‚Äôs health. When it gets low, heal up (if not bloodied) and start being more cautious. Unfortunately, they still haven‚Äôt addressed the bug that makes you unable to respawn if you die as the event ends. Until they do, you just have to try to avoid it. 
---
If you‚Äôre holding pylons, your priority should be staying alive. Get a hit or two in on the Imposter and then just get yourself to safety and stay alive.
---
I get 9 challenges a day. I‚Äôm at 31. I‚Äôm hoping as we get higher up- we get more challenges. Depending on our level.
---
If your on xb1, add me and when I get on later i can give some help with the camp and show you some decent spots. Obviously a few starter items I can throw your way while we start off. Gt is narmyknight
---
First aid rank 3, super stimpaks &amp; troubleshooter armor.
---
Edit - Also a high RoF vampire weapon
---
I'm only level 30 and I've seen only a few guns out of what this game has but honestly more WW2 guns like the 1911 and BAR like you said. I honestly would not mind if they had stuff like the anti-material rifle.
---
WW2: 1911, BAR, M1 Garand, Grease gun
---
Fallout 3: Chinese assault Rifle (I guess it's technically the handmade rifle but still), Chinese pistol, BB gun, Sniper Rifle, Auto Axe
---
Fallout New Vegas: 12.7mm weapons, any form of lever action, nail gun(for memes)
---
That's all I've got but I mean I would love to see some new headgear like night vision goggles
---
I believe it doesn't count as on the ground if it's on a built floor in your CAMP.  Or the big tent you can build.  I rolled with a primitive CAMP with all my stuff out in the open and the tent just for sleeping in, and I don't remember getting any diseases from sleeping.
---
The raider vendor bot at whitesprings should sell the plans for the roadleathers and the plans for atleast a couple of the upgrades but tbh idk how to get the shielded upgrade
---
Lol I love this idea.
---
That was going to be my reaction but then I quickly noticed the fact he was tied up and had a muzzle on him, and the most important fact he wasn't trying to attack me.
---
Thanks a lot, my GT is busterell777 I‚Äôm usually online most days
---
The whole S.C.O.R.E design is to make you buy the missing days with atoms, pretty scam system, you shouldn't really worry that much about it though since most rewards suck anyway.
---
No don‚Äôt do that I would not allow my reward go to waste. So twice I had it happen if you die right when the event ends you won‚Äôt be able to respawn but if you wait 10 minutes it will allow you and you can get your reward still. Seriously don‚Äôt back out please I know it‚Äôs annoying but I had happen during the queen fight but when it happened during this event I just let it sit for ten minutes then respawned because I was hoping to get fixer plan and it worked. I promise I had it happen twice and both times I waited and then it would let me I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs a bug but it is but I got the fix for it
---
Bro it‚Äôs a video game...
---
Fair enough. I guess I‚Äôm just amazed when someone says ‚Äúthis game has come so far‚Äù. It‚Äôs incredible and I can‚Äôt wait to see the BoS in future update
---
Fox?
---
What you‚Äôre describing is a symptom of addiction. Obviously, with Coronavirus, traveling probably isn‚Äôt smart right now‚Äîbut under normal circumstances canceling real world family plans to not miss rewards from any game would would be a major red flag. 
---
Take care of yourself. Take a break if you need to. Once you miss a few days and see that it really doesn‚Äôt hurt you, you‚Äôll hopefully break free of that addictive pull.
---
Just go range and let your animal friend tank or just run when it gets close.
---
Or get a really good melee build and 3 shot it.  
---
Or get a stealth ranged build and don't worry about it finding you.
---
Looking at the lvl 22 hiding in the shed
---
Yup. Radiation Rumble is really fun when you have more than 8 players around :)
---
I realize that a fat man, pipe pistol or piece of fruit require equal amounts of data.  10k adhesive is the same as one.
---
When you say that you have one of each outfit, that‚Äôs where the red flag is for me.  You‚Äôre storing an awful lot of individual items, which is giving you crippling lag.  They aren‚Äôt going to change it, so your options are to deal with the lag or dump your collections.
---
I believe the weapon automatically comes with it attached. Don‚Äôt think you can find/buy the mod if you take it off.
---
Bloodied build or "magic" weapon can easily decimate the alpha in a matter of seconds. 
---
I solo PP frequently, its pretty easy
---
And maybe fireproof if the problem is explosions
---
The one near vault 76 passed the farm area??
---
Thanks for the insight. I was kind of worried based on a few recent posts here by a few twats saying (a) they would kick anyone not sharing a perk and (b) he/she set up a public team but was pissed because the teammates would follow as they fast-travelled.
---
Huh interesting. The thing is that the animal friend is squishy af though, at least in my experience. If you aren‚Äôt actively blocking for him he‚Äôs toast.
---
Yep - heavy vampire weapons will keep you alive.
---
He dies no matter what, if u talk to him you have a back and fourth with dutchess and you can decide to let him go, or have sol or you kill him. No matter which way you choose he goes poof from the game, as if they release him you never run into him again. Its assumed he got in a fight with something and got killed.
---
Never had him spawn dead though when I went to do that part of the quest. I reroll a ton cuz I get bored easy, gone thru that part of the storyline 5-7 times by now, never had it glitch out on me yet. Which is more than I can say for thew raider vault 79 raid questline, I had to restart my gamne twice at 2 diff spots because the main quest glitched and would not progress, once when gail was in the chamber, and second when ra-ra, had to open a door past the residental section. On the plus side? I got to kill the 2-4 \*\* to \*\*\* legendaries that spawn during the quest 2-3 times each. So I guess it glitching was not a total loss.
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs music royalty rights. It‚Äôs not cheap and they have to wait for songs to become public domain to use them without paying thousands of dollars to play. (Each ‚Äústream‚Äù costs money.)
---
I managed ton find it twice in two days at charleston on my first time. And on another day i found it and kept it there for 3 hours. At one point there was a queue of people waiting to buy something.
---
EDIT: Screw it. I'll sell you the one i have on my alt for 4k if you want.
---
Lol I played NV last night for the first time and hid in the bushes until someone tried to kill me.  I ended up sprinting around them and punching them a fair amount before they finally one shot me.
---
This is an amazing idea!! I love it, and I think it would be an awesome way for players to make some caps also. Not only that but, it seems that canning/jarring foods would be a craft that would quickly become essential in a dangerous, apocalyptic environment.
---
No at Charleston station
---
He dies no matter what you choose, if they release him, you never see him again so he most likely went totally feral and picked a fight with something and got killed. I usually choose to kill him myself at the end of the dialog myself.
---
Wtf this is all very new to me. I‚Äôm not really into bloodied but what is this magic weapon you speak of?
---
I‚Äôm a full health rifleman, can hold my own against all enemies except for the alpha. If there wasn‚Äôt a bloodied heavy gunner in the room with me I‚Äôd get rekt every time.
---
No, unfortunately you'd have to make a new character and get to level 100 w them to get the achievement
---
Just reaching out here...anyone has an extra bear hands plan willing  to trade or sale?. I mean, i don't have that much to offer but i just want to know how much does it sells for to grind the caps. Since i play mostly alone, it seems people are interested in doing only one friendly beast in Project paradise. Thanks beforehand!

I started maxing out my daily caps limit by making mentats and radaway. Use the chemist and super duper perks to increase the yield. Also, after you make the mentats turn them into grape or orange mentats, so they get doubled a second time.
---
Cooking and selling meat from all the critters you kill is also surprisingly lucrative, especially if you use butcher's bounty and super duper perks. 
---
Also, never buy ammo from NPC vendors. Always make your own, or buy it cheap from players. Tag lead and steel for search, and just grab that junk whenever you see it. Crap like cans, pencils, and rat poison are everywhere.
---
Once you are at a point where you can fast travel all over the map and you have a sense for where to find what you need, you'll never be short of materials.
---
Thanks, bud.
---
Thanks u so kuch for your if i bumped into the shielded I will let u know
---
The first two times I waited pretty long but maybe it wasn‚Äôt ten minutes, I‚Äôll try that next time it happens 
---
I‚Äôve been working so hard trying to get the fixer plan and its not fun feeling like I wasted that time, so thank you!
---
I know how you feel man, been thinking of taking a break... supposed to be fun, you know?
---
Yeah, this is the best advice. You need help, OP. I mean I‚Äôm pretty introverted, and maybe play this game a little more than what my mom would like even though I have my own place now, but I‚Äôd still never cancel plans with my parents or friends just to play around with keyboard clicks and colorful pixels.
---
You‚Äôre on Xbox right? I bought one from a player on here for 5k then next event I got the fixer so I can sell it to you or trade
---
Can you wear the jetpack and a backpack together?
---
No problem dude hope it helps! And thanks that would be awesome
---
Just messaged you me gf's psn.  We sometimes play Fortnite as well since my kiddo got us started on it.  I get into cod a little bit, just not as much as my kiddo.
---
You can hook up with me. I solo the Encryptid all the time.
---
The only thing thats on is the lights of my house extraordinarily ordinary siiiirrrrrr.
---
Where near there is the unique one? I am mad because I saw a girl vendor all the way over near where heart of the swamp happens and she had that coat and a bunch of other stuff but I didn‚Äôt buy and I can not find where she was. She had a whole little camp setup
---
Honestly make sure Geforce Experience scans it and adjusts the settings but also update your graphics card drivers to the latest version. I did both of these things and the game stopped running like crap and now its about a constant 60fps. If you still have issues screw with the window mode.
---
So I just started playing yesterday, and I'm enjoying it. Is there any tips you could give a new player?
---
Do it solo with a sneak build and scorch beast food.
---
But Vulpes-Lanius, it's water-cooled.
---
So afiak there are two types of magic weapons, weapons with a specific legendary effect that have a fire rate of over 200 or magic shotguns. Like junkies is one of the effects, or 40% more bash damage, or 33% vats accuracy. If you combine at least one of those effects on an automatic weapon with a fire rate of over 200, it breaks it and it does insanely high dps. I am less familiar with the magic shotguns, but I know its magic happens in vats
---
I suggest watching angry turtles videos on youtube about both. You do not need the damage perks for either heavy guns or shotguns to deal the insane damage.
---
Lv3 animal is very tanky, it can never die if u kill animals fast enough.
---
&gt; There's a plethora of exploration in 76 that doesn't focus on the grind, loot or min/maxing
---
That doesn't excuse how horrifically lacking the repeatable content is. The "exploration" content of the game is finite and one can easily visit and thoroughly explore every marked location by Level 80 or so. Exploration is not endgame content by definition as you're assumed to have already visited the locations. 
---
&gt; If you're a classic ES/FO explorer? Who likes to explore every little nook and cranny? There's an absolute ton in 76. 
---
I've seen 99% of it and wandering aimlessly to find that one note I didnt read isnt my ideal form of entertainment. I'd much rather play another Fallout game that has more side quests during exploration i.e. more content. The fantastic locations of Fo76 are largely just missed opportunities that *would* be engaging if there were NPCs and better quests at launch. 
---
To use a metaphor - I assume some people would find 400 hours of entertainment out of CAMP building. But most people? No, more like 10 hours considering the limitations on building. 
---
I started a new character for Wastelanders; I've explored every marked location, probably most of the unmarked ones, I did every daily, event, and side quest. I've got a Bloodied Gauss Minigun and max rep on both factions, I've got the jetpack mod, etc. But I've already given up on the game and I am playing Fallout 2 and Halo 5; Fo76 just isnt the type of online game where you can engage in the repeatable content in a fun manner. 
---
&gt; no doubt tires and gets repetitive quickly, and players in that stage are thirsty for more compelling, challenging and rewarding content. Understandable. 
---
And you should understand that just a few tweaks would really make the game worth playing. They've added a lot of grind mechanisms (reputation, gold, Seasons, scrip) but they havent added a commensurate magnitude of repeatable content. There currently *is* no point to grinding a month or two for a bloodied Gauss Minigun. Killing the Queen faster isn't a real goal, just an addiction to FOMO/grind progression.
---
Anyway, to the tweaks: They should have launched Wastelanders with a better way to engage with the two factions - resource collection via taking the Workshops for your faction, events that are Raiders v Settlers or Defend Crater events (not like defending workshops, something actually fun), etc. Radiation Rumble-esque events should replace those god awful dailies that are uselessly boring.
---
What the fuck do they even need a cooled bone saw for anyways?!?! Just use the normal ones that you can find literally everywhere.
---
An idea so good you just ***KNOW*** Bethesda will ignore it.
---
I always put on the chinese stealth suit and then tank all three pylons while everyone else does the hard work. Event complete every time and I dont die. Also take a few pot shots with a suppressed weapon to get the loot.
---
I'm actually really happy to hear this i know its weird but idk I thought maybe there was something in my game making it happen like a perk I wasn't awar of or idk anything but to hear its just another one of the many bugs... I dont remeber fallout 4 having that problem did it?
---
I didnt know there was a spread wofh the gauss rifle I thought it was a single shot
---
Oh my god you‚Äôre right I didn‚Äôt even think of that! I have a vampire flamer in my stash I think, that might really do the trick
---
Make sure you have a leather unyielding difficult to detect in the dark piece and keep out of the light.
---
Time to step up and go bloodied, u can't go back then.
---
What system you on
---
Undoubtedly it's so you can cut water-cooled bones, damaged when the intrusion sensor went missing, and  diagnosed with the multiscope. And the bone water comes from an osmosis kit, for optimal purity.
---
Is there a better single shot weapon to use in combination with gun fu and adrenaline??
---
"Chill, calm down and be patient" He said 18 months after the games release and we're still missing promised features, game is still over-run with exploits, and doesn't have an end-game.

Welcome to Reddit, lol.

lol yea they do look very tempting, I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt randomly sleep around üòÇ

They don‚Äôt even have a hospital at foundation, like what the hell are they even doing with all this advanced medical tech.

You‚Äôll come back for the easy Treasury Notes.

You are donating the reward, right?

I am. I‚Äôm 90% sure today‚Äôs the day, but it might say screw you and put me at a sliver under or something

Just yesterday I got a (I forget the name) card for cheaper vendor sales, I'm already at level 3 on it.  I looked again and it's still there.   Maybe it's a gold?  Idk.  This is super weird.  I guess it just works.
---
Best story ever.
---
You can totally go alone. Been playing since beta, mostly solo.
---
If you could manage to get a full set of weightless, ap refesh, sneak and got the chameleon mutation would be best. Armor weight helps with sneaking and you wont need the agi points for sneak.
---
Escape artist+silenced full auto handmade gun(or even better fixer due to its stealth bonuses), with 2 in sneak, and 3 in covert ops can melt things decently fast without a magic weapon, often without it finding you, I've killed legendary scorchbeasts without it finding me with that build, it lands and I stand in front of its face shooting it till it dies and it doesn't notice me at all. Not using Chinese stealth armor or any chamelion stuff either. Sadly the adds it summons always seems to find me damn near instantly though, I think its a anti-cheese mechanic. Mind you if you just kill the adds quick you can escape artist back into sneak and go from danger to caution right in front of the sorchbeast, then get 2.5x sneak attacks on its face again.
---
Escape artist is godly for stealth it does 2 things: 1: it makes running have no effect on stealth when crouched, which lets you literally run up to things faces and melee them with 2 in sneak, as they no longer hear your footsteps when running.
---
and 2: if you do hit danger you can stand up, and go back into crouch and it'll usually make them lose you and put you back into caution so you can get sneak attacks again. Works even if your right in front of the enemy at times too. You can get escape artist at 35 and its one I deff reccomend you grab it the second you can. it makes stealth so much easier. Sometimes it takes more than 1 stand up/recrouch, but it usually works especially if you move while doing it. Note: escape artist is disabled entirely if your in power armor, none of the perk works when in PA.
---
I used to be a semi-auto rifle build, but I recently been starting to go full auto, just got commando, expert command, master commando, and groundpounder at rank 1 atm, and I notice my kill speeds are VASTLY faster vs things that don't normally die in 1 shot. My next char when one wasteland drops will be going commando from the get go, as its just far better in the end. Prob commando+heavy weapons, as gatling laser and plasma gatling save a ton of ballistic ammo with how often you find fusion cores especially for the gatling laser.
---
My bad if I paid more attention I wouldn't have said it. I was thinking along the lines of the gauss shotgun.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing though, I‚Äôm a filthy casual and not very strong in the way of raw skill. I need more HP headroom than bloodied will afford. 
---
That plus the fact that after 3K+ worth of legendary scrip spent at the vendor, the only bloodied weapons I‚Äôve rolled have been freaking rolling pins and crap like that.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on Xbox, but I‚Äôve only got about 3000 caps and not too much of value to bargain with but I‚Äôll check
---
Make an alt. 
---
Seriously, that‚Äôs the best way to handle this. 
---
We already have too many instances of players not being able to load in their first CAMPs, due to other players, CAMPs and Tents. We don‚Äôt need to increase that problem by about 20%.
---
Never mind I see what level you‚Äôre. I‚Äôll just give it to you
---
Nope, you can solo the whole game as lone wanderer. However there are benefits when you play in a team/group, especially with the new Legendary Run dailies. They made joining a public group super easy so you‚Äôre good to go.
---
Not everyone has a 3 charisma to even share a perk
---
Or how about we bring back processing machines from fallout 4? Those would come in handy, too!
---
I would honestly switch to Commando, Rifleman isn‚Äôt really worth it. If you‚Äôre gonna use Rifleman then I suggest using a Railway rifle or a Gauss.
---
Now I've got to add train stations to my list of stuff to grind, lol.
---
Something folksy.
---
I can totally help, although I‚Äôm not that good with encrypted. Dm me your gamertag and tell me when we are getting on to do it
---
Are you bringing photos of Crater to Ward and declining the caps?  Are you telling the deserter Raider during Retirement Plan to move to Foundation?
---
I do have one point in escape artist and it‚Äôs great but even so I barely seem to deal more than a paper cut to the legendary sheepsquatch. 
---
When I roll with my shotgun though it‚Äôs a much more even fight, but still need backup to keep the friendly beasts alive. 
---

Oh okay, I didn‚Äôt know about the splitter mod, thanks. Plasma cores will change stats for the better? I thought having Ultracite would be most beneficial.
