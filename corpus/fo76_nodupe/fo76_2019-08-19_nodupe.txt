As long ad we get the M1 Garand-appropriate sound upon empty, seems like a great idea.
---
---
---
Because unlike with SBQ, with collosal problem there is a limit of 8 players in the instance and having people not pull their weight means basically no damage being done. 
---

---
Already encountered the event twice today with three mid 20's / 30's characters and there was simply not enough dps because of that which would have resulted in spending 12 to 15 minutes non stop firing and wasting ammo unless the others are optimized bloodied.
---
you can tame on consoles as well you need animal friend rank 3 and is has to be a random encounter
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ID0ergG.jpg) the red dots on this map can have tameable creatures ...but not all creatures you find at the spots are tamable but if you have the perk on and the creature doesnt attack you it should be tamable

There isn‚Äôt anything remotely Marxist about Communist China anymore. Maybe 30 years ago or more, but now it‚Äôs as rampantly consumerist and capitalist as the US. It‚Äôs just an authoritarian nation with a veneer of communism, like America isn‚Äôt as devoted to freedom as it claims to be.
---
Winter so possibly March 31 2021
---
Yeah just non stop events really since Fasnact 
---
And I always forget to trade them smh ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It‚Äôs been how they‚Äôve done it for all new armor. I agree they don‚Äôt want people skipping progression as well, but there‚Äôs prob a lot of reason they introduced soul bound gear. One of them being they recognized their RNG system is bad but chose a simple solution to meet players in the middle without admitting the mistake.
---
If you move location, everything will be saved. You just need to either place it back down or scrap manually
---
It‚Äôs... fallout. It chugs most of the time.
---
Edit: not all the time obviously, but it‚Äôs rarely at 30 and any blast event routinely sees it it 20-25 range. Pull up the quick wheel and sometimes it‚Äôs 0.
---
I finished today as well . Felt the same , put my poster up , put another stein on the bar rail and put a lamp that doesn‚Äôt work proper next to my bbq . It may not project the stars but it‚Äôs got a nice purple glow.  And I could care less about power armour skins. The 500 atoms really should be 1200 . So at least after completing it you can choose a bundle .
---
I started using junkies weapon as I was already using chems to boost my damage, I didn‚Äôt know how junkies builds worked but this reddit was a good source of info, now I got a junkie minigun which I think will be fine post update as it‚Äôs not single unit damage but culminated damage, I have a explosive vats critical junkies 10mm that does 70 something damage which is great, I‚Äôm a vats critical junkies build? I have a feeling that furious &amp; faster firing weapons might be better post update. Hopefully they don‚Äôt make low fire rate weapons to harsh to use, I‚Äôve always wanted a good hunting rifle or pipe revolver.
---
You can, doesn't mean u should though xD
---
I think that would be a really nice addition, but there are so many more pressing matters. They need to make it so we can play the game before they make the game enjoyable
---
Maybe try and get level 1 3* armour which has terrible resistance but still gives things like AP refresh etc.
---
Ah, see I didn't know that, I'd forgotten since I read the notes in it, thanks friend for the info
---
So crafting I‚Äôve had some luck but not a ton. Gauss mini best I crafted was a two shot. Then I got guass shotgun. First roll I crafted a two star bloodied. Said good enough. Didn‚Äôt craft anymore, have received a couple from purveyor but nothing good. After my gold stacked up and buying all t65 I bought the guass pistol and plasma. First roll on pistol crafted a junkies and received another from purveyor. Plasma I crafted once got a assassins, received a berserkers from purveyor. Now the armor for secret service. Got the arms and chest first, with in two crafts for all 3 I got all 3 star unyielding. I said shit this is easy, being armor was first thing I did. Well the legs took I swear 80 crafts each to get unyielding. So ever since that experience I will not craft anything anymore. I just use my scrip on rolls from purveyor which I‚Äôm glad I did or I would‚Äôve not received bloodied fixer. Sorry it was long, but I wanted you to hear the pain I‚Äôve received from the rng crafting gods lol
---
Furious... Executioners?  Those are both primary effects, you can't have them both on the same weapon.
---
Why Scrapper?  Equip Batteries included instead, save inventory space on fusion cores.
---
Drop Suppressor and equip Tenderizer instead.  The best defense is a good offense, kill 'em quick.
---
Assuming you run mutations, drop One Gun Army and equip Class Freak instead.  I used to run it, but dropped it ever since stagger screws up the SBQ fight.
---
I don't have a clue why you have a few down votes, but it means absolutely nothing.  Just ignore it.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm doing the mothman dance in a fissure site. Just once.
---
Red one also have it's dedicated jetpack. Green do not have one.
---
So in the end everything in this week's atom shop update is broken... wow
---
What are the odds that I happen to come across this at [69 updoots](https://i.imgur.com/Vnoeo7N.png)? *Nice!*
---
45 second load time?  Ouchie
---
I volunteer as tribute
---
This would bring more players to the game . I‚Äôm completely serious . If you could go around taking and petting / cuddling creatures , you would have more of a fan base.
---
I mean I'm glad ur not being malicious with the bug but still xD
---
Don't forget to pop some mentats. My next grind is for a torn mothman wing.
---
Games have been crashing since 1958. This game is nothing new
---
But we all have to go place camps, hunt Down bad dogos, play bush Wookiee, and burn to death. Is this not playing NW? Am I doing it all wrong?
---
Runs fine on my friends' aside from the meatpile bug lately
---
Have you tried not dying?
---
While you mock him needlessly, those of us plagued by this bug cannot hardly play the new content.  The more people who post about it the more visibility it'll have and a slightly higher than zero chance to be fixed
---
Thank you
---
Gauss pistol wasn‚Äôt AWFUL, but it took a while, and I ended up with a berserkers.
---
The worst part of this all is that I crafted a shit ton of plasma cores before crafting the caster, not knowing it used cartridges, and couldn‚Äôt use it for like a week.
---
Just move like you suggest, then you can reuse items for your new camp and save on your junk items or scrap it if you don't need it. If you have blue prints you can break the blueprint and then reuse or scrap.
---
Is it a bug issue or is it designed so you cannot respawn if you die?  I have yet to try it
---
I've done this as well. I use a cooking spit and build a camp in the side of the retaining wall outside of the White springs train station.
---
It happened to me yesterday in the wise mothman event, when do you say they fixed it? In today's patch?
---
Runs fine, just low FPS.
---
I would even appreciate if I could scrap the legendaries - just for more material than regular one... like, you would get the material you usually dont when scraping.
---
Ok, thanks for clearing things up :)
---
I've noticed fixes or changes in many of the patches that were not in the patch notes. It's far to coincidental.
---
Shooting up radiation is one hell of a bloody good time.
---
Thanks man, this map is going to be really helpful. :)
---
I dont think I got my atoms this month yet either but I didny keep track so I'm not 100 percent sure
---
I'd use a mic but it's frustrating on an Xbox controller 3.5 input when you have to find that sweet magic spot where bot mic and speakers work.
---
I have three headsets and multiple controllers and they all have this issue.
---
Must have left the kitchen light on with the window open.
---
I‚Äôm dancing with malicious intent, in a fissure without paying my rent
---
When the boss dies, it apparently resets a room before the boss which is where you respawn when you die.  So if you happen to die in the last ten seconds of a ten-fifteen minute fight you get cut off from the loot.  Imo it's just bad design
---
It's becoming comical now.  It seems they can't do anything right.
---
No worries, a genuine question was asked, so it was answered :)
---
Because they can, I guess.
---
Theres no fast way to do this really.  Either move it and build what gets stored or you have to break it down piece by piece.  There should really be a scrap all button for camps
---
No, comes from a static spawn location. You might have to server hop a few times to find it though.
---
Will try that next time Elon.  Thanks for all the great ideas you bring us
---
yes and one last thing make sure the animal friend perk is on while you look for the pet , they don't seem to spawn if you don't have the perk equip beforehand
---
Ok
---
This is a bug with the event respawn vs normal respawn system they have in place
---
If you die and your death animation plays right as the event ends, the game will get stuck and be unable to figure out whether you are getting a normal respawn (drop loot, select location) or event respawn (keep loot, automatic location).
---
This has been an issue for ages, and it's particularly noticable at SBQ for example where a scorpion poisons you right as the queen dies and the event ends.
---
And just like all the other bugs, it hasn't been acknowledged or fixed.
---
I hope you got out the RAID (kills bugs dead).
---
If you could spring for a wireless headset its worth it. I went through like 5 wired mics before I went wireless due to the same problems.
---
But.. What if I wanted to sit on top of the gorilla?
---

It's no longer a world spawn. It's a reward from the quest [Tracking Unknowns](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tracking_Unknowns)
---
Todd bless you.
---
Yup.  Regardless of the listed objective, the objective of most players is to get the maximum benefit for the least effort.  That means extracting as much XP, useful materials and legendary drops as they can, regardless of what the event says.
---
This is the same reason a lot of events time out with no one showing up.  The goal isn't to complete events, it's to farm whatever players need to farm.
---
üòÇüòÇ You know?  Now that you mention it, most have been Deguerre, she was OUTSIDE when I arrived! Damn!
---
Ah alrighty lol
---
Still don't see how that means the community is jaded tho
---
Bars xD
---
Agreed.
---
If it makes you feel better, the bunker has an annoying thing where everything you place is floating a few inches from the floor
---
Since the newest patch this morning, I've experienced three crashes in 45 minutes (on PC).
---
Yup, my bloodied triple barrel gauss minigun can of RAID!
---
Yet it was delayed 3 fucking times to fix bugs.
---
Shadow legends?
---
Not really, just wouldn‚Äôt mind a performance mode. Then again, the low FPS allows me to game the jet pack (and get super high) during a SBQ event when the frame rate drops significantly.
---
The payout for most events is pitiful, compared to what's earned just for killing the enemies.  Events without enough enemies become very low priority, and events with sufficient enemies turn into farms.
---
Are you unable to get rid of those nightmares?
---
Ah ok, thanks again.
---
*Laughs in master race*

[removed]

Can anybody translate this?
---
I have 1300  ..i forget to turn them in
---
Ill see what this colossus has to offer but this game is on some of its last legs
---
Just wondering?  Constantly see people bitching about there being no consequences for dying. 
---
Intentional or not by the devs, it should be that way.  The few times I've died after the SBQ I've acknowledged that I've gotten killed because I made a dumb mistake and will play better the next time so I don't lose my flux.  Guess they should just hand you all the rewards for not finishing the event like the people who actually did...
---

Building teams at least have the advantage of being started and looked for by players who understand that an intelligence bonus is generally better than any of the other bonuses.
---
I came out of the fort last week end to an active line in the sand event and joined in.  I was ready to defend to generator then realized everyone was facing inwards - then the spawn next to me and blazing guns -wtf.  That was nuts.
---
Once it finished and *tried* to go the generator to collect some loot, hit the stairs and went to about 1 frame every couple seconds.  Decided I didn‚Äôt need to loot and bugged out.  All the bodies maybe?
---
Everyone just needs to keep submitting tickets.

Wait.. What?
---
I knew they kept them destroyed to attempt to manipulate the spawn locations, but they collect ore faster that way? o.O
---
I have not had any major issues with it as yet.
---
No you cant, because even if someone has enough others not, you can sell them. Thats enough for some Players to farm them.
---
Did you try shooting the PTS Deathclaw in the torso? That is actually supposed to be the weak spot for Deathclaws.

It looks like if someone took a UV lamp to local motels.

Abby is also missing a corpse.

This is a user-side issue. I tested this on my system and had no issues at all. 
---
While Bethesda will likely refund your Atoms, you had a controller or lag issue; it‚Äôs not related to this specific bundle.
---
It's worth a try

Can't tell if roleplaying as BoS or not...

It's also in Fallout Tactics.

I got stuck at episode 358 years ago, didn't pick it up again since then. How many collosal problems do I run with you for you to catch me up? :P
---
Thank god i can solo it. Jump in with a 87 and 100, they did a good job aggro the colossus and the wendigos so I just sneak around popping heads. We all died immediately after putting Ernie down.... The game load me out of the cave :(

Excellent, he won't be visiting you again.

And it dropped a ‚≠ê Medic's Pipe Wrench
---
Not gonna bother reading, simple answer, don‚Äôt buy commie scum :))))))))
---
I havent even gotten half way... im considering just watching shield hero instead.
---
Clearly what happened is they were working on adding the steel dawn fatigues and someone accidentally changed one of the attributes for the Bos fatigues. It was a bug and was patched today. The notes today say it was a bug. Believe whatever you want but it makes no sense for them to change an underarmor randomly to an outfit after almost 2 years.
---
THANK YOU!
---
So the random rock falls kill you instantly and you can't loot anything at the end. Did it once and never again.
---
Anti armor works just as well or junkies. Its only a problem with too many non-optimized stealthers or low levels.. (The latter currently happens too often)
---
what? the shaking fist emote. it‚Äôs only in that bundle
---
i say we cut out the middle men and add scrip stations and bullion exchangers to the camp, but maybe for balance it could be like a ‚Äòlite version‚Äô where you would only get like 75 scrip or 100 bullion from it and for the other half you‚Äôd have to go to a normal spot
---
I "love" the event itself. It was cool fight tbh. However, I feel like there are some bad bugs, and the reward is just meh. :(
---
The game will be flooded with screws. Supply and demand dictates the value of screws will plummet. 
---
But in any case I'm still 100% correct that you can get a metric fuck ton of screws and also kill the boss. Using "i need to farm screws" as an excuse to ignore the boss is just being a self centered, entitled ass hat.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇStalker wood arm....
---
almost every weapon class has a perk that allows you to reload that type of weapon faster
---
"Ground Pounder" and "Lock and Load" for example
---
Because this came across as *‚Äôit couldn‚Äôt possibly be my equipment or anything on my side at all and I refuse to believe otherwise‚Äô. That‚Äôs the tone some people perceive. 
---
And this sub is mercurial. The same content/tone post can get praised or vilified, depending on a lot of factors.
---
What I tend to do for anything worthwhile, regarding weapons or armor, is check on pricing for PC (I play on Xbox, so prices aren't exactly 1:1). I'll get an estimate, then drop the price by 1k or 2k caps. Usually my stuff sells in decent time, but it strongly depends on who shows up and what they need. Plans go for 20 caps a piece, unless they're incredibly common (to the point where I can easily get them without going out of my way - I'm looking at you, Mole Miner Gauntlet), at which point I drop them to 5 caps. I'm not looking to make hundreds of thousands of caps, I just wanna clear my inventory out.
---
I unloaded over 15,000 rounds of .50 at it over two attempts. On the second attempt I'm not 100% sure if we killed it or not - there was a sliver of HP left with the timer down to 0:02 sec. The first attempt, I was killed just before the "escape the mine" segment ran, and I was respawned into a ton of boulders coming down on me, so I don't know if we killed it that time or not either.
---
So question: Does the 'escape!' segment run only when the timer runs out, or does it happen when you kill the colossus too? In other words did I win one?
---
Does it make sense I should dump 15k of ammo into the fight? (Final Word 50cal, level 238ish)
---
What quests?
---
And they aren‚Äôt in your pip boy?
---
So your post is of no help to this guy ü§£
---
Unlikely in the near future. in case you were unaware, they are releasing instanced "bunkers" that we can add to our camps. Exactly what those will consist of or how they will change our existing budget is unknown at this time.
---
Kinda like my dad that went out for smokes...

---
When you remove any item from a container that container will be empty for a length of time as little as 24hrs but I‚Äôve had it last multiple days
---
Well this one also removes the possibility of new revenue because many of the new players had a lot of difficulty as it was so after the patch they can no longer fall back to the forest to build up supplies.
---
End game commando and heavy builds will not be affected much so they do not care about it but I mean no new players mean the game will not last much longer.
---
It could be intentional to kill 76 so they do not need to put anymore money into it. I mean we are almost on 3 years nothing has been fixed and we have seen one content update so far. 
---
It is pretty hard to stay positive about the game when they keep giving us the finger. 
---
I guess it kind of makes sense instead of fixing or balancing any weapons just make everything else unusable so they do not have to do any more work on later.
---
I personally wouldn‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm still waiting for it to come out on Console. Which I won‚Äôt even begin to go into how frustrating that is.
---
Inferno
---
Probably the most painful death. I'll still wouldn't mind going out that way though!
---
The only type that gives a set bonus is excavator, so why not mix and match? In the past I used x-01 chest, t-51 legs, t-60 arms and helm. I liked the look of different pieces so I just combined them to make it look the way I wanted it. Now I have t-65 and atom shop skins, though.
---
Sister should have logged off when the nuke announcement went off
---
While using stations at my camp are what I‚Äôve wanted for this, I‚Äôd also happily take it as individual initiated mini-events or quests at different locations, too, TBH. Feed the People grants us a very small amount of stew for the effort, but it makes a bit of sense. Similarly, we could get Sweetwater‚Äôs Special Blend for turning in honey as we currently do, but get a pasteurized version for protecting the pipes during Tea Time. Hunt down enough mason jars, sugar, assorted fruits, and firewood to supply a bot/NPC in Helvetia for jams and preserves. Maybe supply some Delbert‚Äôs Appalachili or his other recipes that could be canned with some wood and cans or mason jars and keep the cook site in Flatwoods from getting ravaged too badly by low level ghouls, molerats, and radroaches while it boils? Get Murgle a new owner over by Welch that you can supply teas, jars, coal and a bit of radrat, molerat, or mirelurk meat for the cat to pay for the service (tins of coffee + purified water + sugar + acid + coal to get a super AP regen brew from here would be fitting, too)...
---
I would prefer to craft them, but more little interactions in the game = fun to me and I like the idea of canning taking a bit of effort and time.
---
It can go over a window
---
If it was the last one, that can auto complete if someone in your party launches a nuke
---
As a fire breather myself, I would fangirl over meeting Melody Larkin.
---
All others Jet Packs that I have, Mothman and Red Rocket I needed to craft on the PA wirh the skin
---
Fallout 76 is the unique case where both the player base and the developers are dumb as a bag of hammers
---
Damn, guess I'm way overpriced then. I've got some weapons in there for 1k caps per star. I don't really care if they sell or not, I've been lazy with taking pictures and putting them on the trading sub.
---
Bring lots of ammo
---
There's no copyright on Communism! (as far as I'm aware anyways..)

The datamined numbers are actually pretty kind. Plushie's got the best odds of anything, and the heads have the worst before the helmet.

Good one!!
---
You get 2 legendarys, a chance at cursed weapons on top and also unique event rewards and flux on top of that, I am ok with it.
---
Within "A Colossal Problem" inside the mine during the boss fight, I was encountering my .50cal auto-firing after reload - going right into full auto mode even though I wasn't triggering it. I had to click my fire trigger again to make it stop. Didn't happen outside Monongah Mine at all. Hasn't been happening to me before today.
---
The commies took Bethesda HQ! OH GOD
---
then dont buy
---
some people think their shit is golden
---
just look at what some ppl charge for the new common event drops
---
 "" Add a free version of atomic shop plans that are less fancy than atom shops ""  
---
No, no. FIRST you and alot of Players need to yell for another Monetization system. Getting Content for free sounds lovley and good but it was clear that this dont come without side effects. And we see that with the Atom Shop.  
---
Even if you take the part out that Bethesda want Money they need to finance content, without the Atom Shop its not possibile. It was clear from the Start that the stuff they release in the Shop are special things you just can get from there.
---
Wow, 5k screws in ones possession basically makes you the Jeff Bezos of the wasteland. You should be able to buy and sell other players on your server for sport. 
---
I had like 300 screws one time and thought I should just retire from the game since there‚Äôs no better high to chase than knowing I could craft literally a fully upgraded anything like one whole time.
---
Are they rare/worth much?
---
I'm level 205 on my lower level commando character and I use a pipe rifle all the time. I have a junkies explosive one that does 120 damage and I use it in all low level areas because 38 is cheaper to burn then ultracite 45. It's actually fine for everything but bosses in a pinch.
---
WTF Chicken coop takes 77 wood and 2 corn (lol) to make. There goes my budget.
---
I like your idea about the board and the x
---
You should be able to scrap legendaries for a chance at getting modules. Scrip is only the currency used to purchase rng items at the purveyor. At least if you get modules, you can somewhat target the legendary item you want.
---
Please seek professional mental help
---
Furious/executioners, I have multiple lmgs, they're the only weapon I use, should have worded that better, edited it for clarity also thanks for the tips, ill try them out!
---
Could probably do something with the sitting gorilla statue. Unfortunately I don't have that unlocked to give it a try
---
This is completely new news to me.. an instanced bunker would be amazing as long as we can have a bigger build limit. Any idea when this is meant to be happening? 
---
by the way thank you for your comment!
---
Nope
---
I also am in a noob area though, which might have something to do with it. But yeah, I can‚Äôt be bothered to keep up with the trading sub to see what things are worth so everything except one or two are flat priced like that
---
The issue goes even deeper than that. It's quite fascinating, I wish I knew more behind the scenes. Look at the screaming eagle skin for instant. That's created from scratch, it even has multiple variants in the game files. Yet it had blatant clipping issues, attachment incompatibilities, and misaligned parts
---
So when I‚Äôm claiming workshops for the Daily‚Äôs/Weeklys, I glitch into containers to prevent rolls from initiating PvP with me just because I want SCORE. 2/5 times, there‚Äôs a troll waiting in Chameleon. So I go out of sight, glitch in and initiate the claim anyhoo to frustrate them.
---
If you mean budget, yes, when instanced camps come out they said it will have a vast budget, if you mean how big of a camp you can build, like the green boundary, i highly doubt it
---
I'm not sure there's a worse thing you can do to another player.
---
May their sushi be served at a slightly inconveniently warm temperature that does not endanger the establishment but makes it taste less refreshing and they get soda from a soda fountain that has run out of syrup. 
---
And to your rescuers, may dogs in cars at red lights pop out of the window to wink at them and make cute eye contact and may their legendary kills always be conveniently found.
---
and we (the PC players) hate you, because of you we got those awful UIs and controls since TES IV
---
on a related note:  
---
Who the fuck thought it would be a good idea to put "throw grenade" on the same key than "do stronk melee attack"
---
If you like those drop rates, then I may have some good news for you on the next treasure hunter event based on current info in the PTS. Stay tuned...
---
You're acting as if the exact same thing didn't happen with wastelanders. Delayed a whole 6 months, select community members were given access to a PTS months in advance, and...when it comes out, blatant bugs are found within an hour
---
Is it from Cyanide and Happiness?
---
Yeah, probably an ROI thing. Costs x to develop and put through a round of testing. Find bugs. Cost of fixing bugs is y. Putting stuff out as is makes z. Putting stuff out after fixes could make less than z+y, meaning it‚Äôs not worth fixing.
---
I agree, I thought the unique rewards were kind of interesting. I‚Äôm a big fan of the mask and the mounted heads.
---
I wonder how much the area actually really matters. I'm set up on the acid vent east of Top of the World and I get very little traffic.
---
But a while ago I was looking for an AA lever rifle and I went to every vendor that had weapons for sale, no matter where they were. I think if people want to buy stuff they'll travel for it. Unless that's just me.
---
Loot his body? The one time my team did manage to kill him (at least I think so, his HP and the timer went to zero at about the same time) he vanished into the ground, no bodies. And I had to leave about 37 unlooted Wendigoes all over the cavern because I had a limited amount of time to escape.
---
This has been posted so many times.  Bethesda DGAF.  I'm upvoting anyway.
---
I'm not really sure when, I don't really keep up with the news. I'm sure someone will chime in eventually with more info.
---
I hope it's significant. I love building but we are severly limited in 76.
---
I usually have them in vending for a week then scrip them
---
I‚Äôve been tempted to get the log cabin, then the shed, then the garage, but I was really interested in this one.  Too bad the screwed it up.  The only structure I have bought is the green house dome building which fits a whole camp worth of stuff - all my crafting stations, armor stand and The astronaut allies table as well.  Happy with that one.
---
It‚Äôs not just simply nerfing the damage.
---
They changed how damage is calculated (multiplicative to additive). It‚Äôs a big difference.
---
That is rebalancing to help against builds that can have exponential damage increase.

Yeah, what on earth was Bethesda thinking putting up a gameplay change on the public TEST server?!? How stupid of them to release it to a set of servers so that people can test it and give feedback about it!! I cannot believe they are literally this incompetent to test these massive gameplay changes to give them a chance to adjust based on feedback before taking the update live without testing. Unplayable!
---
damage needed nerfing
---
And while the idiots ahem players of 76 give them money for these items, it will continue.
---
If someone paid you for your toilet deposits why would you ever seek to give them something better?
---
This is exactly why how Bethesda handles damage for ranged weapons in Fallout 4/76 is just dumb. Somehow changing the receiver without changing the caliber increases the damage. If anything barrel length would have a factor on bullet damage.
---
Just wait until the next Season.
---
There's a CHUNKY B.O.S. Bunker that you can get as a reward.
---
You need a torn mothman wing? I just had one. You on Xbox? I'll keep an eye out.
---
I think your logic made someone mad lol.
---
Take your scrip to the Rusty Pick. There you can trade for either a random melee weapon, ranged weapon, or armor with random legendary effects. If you have completed the wastelanders vault raid, you maybe interested in the legendary modules. These can be used to craft specific types of weapon or armor with random legendary effects The plans for these has to be bought with gold bouillon at vault 79, crater or foundation. These include gauss pistol, guass shotgun, guass minigun, gauntlet, electrified cattleprod, plasmacaster, and the secret service armor pieces. Basically you can just keep crafting, while you have the legendary modules and other ingredients until you get the legendary effects you want.  The unwanted results can be sold for scrip to help but more modules.
---
I remember seeing a post somewhere saying that melee in this engine literally just shoots a short range bullet into a single point in front of you, so it really wouldn't be hard if that is true. It could treat it like a minigun, with the "pull down" animation replacing the spin up
---
I got em just as I was beginning my godawful crafting slog for gauss shotguns and minis. The chase for legendary modules was so depressing i don't think i could have handled running out of screws.
---
This too. All stations and towns to have both Scrip/Notes machines.
---
Yes!
---
Level 1, spawn. Level 50, legacy
---
That may be true, but what about builds that struggle to even achieve good damage, such as Beserkers. Now they will do even less damage than before, even though their builds are more risky than bloodied builds, so should these builds be nerfed even when they weren‚Äôt efficient in the first place?
---
Just do what the rest of us do. Grab the one off the top of westtek roof and pretend you got it the hard way.
---
Me too, the x01 looks good standard but the quantum is nice, and I think it's better than the fo4 quantum
---
Lol oops
---
There are exactly 58 ghouls in the burrows, and each yields on average .7 of the XP that the 55 Super Mutants do at Westek.  The highest concentration of ghouls is whitesprings with a total of 80, followed by the 64 at the DMV.  For pure XP/Minute, the DMV and Westek are the highest because both can be done in less than 3 minutes.  I run the burrows multiple times every day, along with all the other locations that I mentioned.  I've charted times/number of enemies/number of legendaries encountered for the course of an entire year.  Your story of leveling up 5 times per hour at a high level, and your claim to completely clear the burrows in 3 minutes are both BS.
---
That‚Äôs the benefit to addressing the way damage is calculated.
---
How do you do this.. I ask for Science!
---
This was expensive and I expected a gate option, this is ridiculous.  I know I should have checked first but it seemed like a no-brainer.  Well, it was  :(
---
I HAVE A LEGACY YEAH BOI!!!!
---
Good describe if this game. "Oh that? That's the pile. We don't talk about it much or it collapses a little bit more."
---
The mythical cursed pickaxe
---
But I diiiiiid!
---
üëç :)
---
Same problem with the Red Rocket  station.  Never buying a prefab again.
---
Finally a costume to hide my egghead and steve, the talking tumor!  Now i just need somthing for my 12 toes on my right shin
---
I didn't even do anything and your words have made me feel guilty.
---
You can't, but it would be a lot cooler if you could.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre crazy if you think there‚Äôs 55 super mutants in west tek lol
---
Pretty much everything from that one Fo4 mod would be nice
---
To be honest I have no idea how to replicate it. I was able to blueprint all the pieces of the station individually though and can set them down anywhere now.
---
well guess I better give up Jet then
---
(dang i forgot the proper fallout 4 answer to that phrase)
---
Then you shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about presenting an imposter perfectly preserved pie in its place.
---
yep- server instability is a big one for me too
---
ive played on shitty private servers hosted in someone's basement for other non Bethesda games that were more stable
---
Whoa, now I understand why I haven't been able to do this. I've been in twice and had a group of 4 and a group of 3...
---
I think the group of 4 pulled it off but I crashed and couldn't get back in so womp womp for me.
---
I've seen 3 in a row.  I couldn't join the second one though.  Don't know if that means anything.
---
Lmfao, this post is not what I thought it was going to be, props
---
Look at what you did u monster!
---
Heres a comment about my build a made over a year ago. Maybe itll help you out.
---
 I run a berserkers, its by far my favorite build. It adds a little danger back to the game. I run a stealth commando build. 
---
- I wear a full set of bolstering sentinel, wood armor ( ill explain why bolstering in a minute ). I break it all so i dont have any DR or ERr at full health. Wood armor is one of the best stealth armor in the game. When its shrouded, it literally weighs .45 pounds and gives you sneak bonuses. Alternatively, you can also wear a Chinese Stealth suit and break it. Ive never tested this method though, but from what I'm told it still gives you radiation resistance even when broken, regular armor doesn't work like that.
---
- On a side note, if you break all your armor, you cant take your armor off, otherwise youll have to rebreak it all. So you cant wear a radsuit to go into nuke zones. Wear power armor and keep an anti armor weapon around in your stash so you can stand a chance. Or you can get a lead lined backpack, radshield, and rad-x. 
---
- I also wear a Raider sheilded underlining. You can mitigate the DR/ER of it by getting addicted to med-x and wearing a high capacity backpack. This gives you a special boost without an armor increase.
---
- The reason i choose to run bolstering armor is because when you start taking damage, your literally 3 hits from death, depending on whats attacking you. This without your perk cards. Bolstering armor will help you tank damage, the lower your health goes, the tankier you get. It will allow you to take 3X-4X more hits before you die.
---
- While your taking damage, your Berserker's weapons will slowly become useless. So what do you do now? Switch to a vampires weapon, this will allow  to keep yourself alive longer as well as reduce the amount of stims you use. I keep 2 vampires weapons on me at all times. 1 is a laser rifle for ranged enemies, and a gatling plasma with a beamsplitter for those pesky melee attacks.
---
- As far as perk cards go, you basically want every card that can help you avoid damage. This is what my build looks like.
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c345fe&amp;d=a72ar2an2pp2la2l71lg2lt2a12ib4eh2l32c72ao0a81sg2pd2pk2pl2&amp;w=&amp;m=1469cf3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Berserker%20Rifleman
---
I run born Survivor to help tank damage as well, i keep a hefty number of Super Stims on me. These used together will keep you alive much longer.
---
- On a side not, my buddy runs a Berserker's as well. His is identical to mine except a few things. He uses bolstering cavalier armor, and also has moving target perk card equipped instead of born Survivor. When he starts taking damage, he runs out of sight to become hidden again. Once hidden, he uses stims to heal up.
---
- I also recommend keeping some phantom devices on you as well and hotkey them. Sometimes things get waaaay out of control and you need retreat. Phantom devices are awesome because they enrage the enemies around you, making them attack each other. This allows you to get away quickly and very efficiently.
---
Its worth saying that 90% of this information was written over a year ago, as well as the build design on Nukes and Dragons. My build has since changed a lot and I've gotten more practiced at the playstyle. It will give you a good basis to start with at the very least, and allow you to make changes to fit your own wants and needs from the build.
---
I really hope this helps you out, id love to see some more Berserker's running around out there. Good luck!
---
LMAO OOPS!
---
The lack of a gate (or really any variation of the fence) makes for a really weak "bundle."  Fortunately I only bought the fence, but wish I'd looked closer, I simply expected a gate...not having one was a slap in the face!
---
Nice
---
Their choice to make it an eight man instance is also an unnecessary slap in the face, doing that event solo can't be easy and if it persists to the released version that's gonna happen a lot
---
Its a game, they'll make some shit up.
---
Just as an update, they refunded my atoms already. At least they were very prompt on doing this.
---
How can you solo this I dumped 4000 5mm from a two shot faster fire rate mini gun and 4 cores from my two shot anti armor gatling plasma along with 500 rounds from my two shot handmade and it felt like I wasn‚Äôt doing shit
---
I'm on playstation but thanks for the thought. Saw one in a player vending machine. Wanted 10100 caps for it.
---
I am disappoint.
---
New event starts if you nuke monagugh mine
---
Nice!
---
Interesting
---
Is this live on PS4? The event anyways just got home and heard it was just on PC right now??
---
Gotcha, cheers for the reply, will have to start looking at that as my biggest issue as I level is weapon weakness, even at level 25...although a kind player crafted me a lvl 15 Fixer, that gun  is pretty cool.
---
Was gonna say I run junkies and still melt everything. Bloodied is not the only viable option agree 100%
---
nope she doesnt have to log off for shit if she doesnt want to. Feel free to try again.
---
I tell you the game is now called farming76 .. that is cool you can farm ammo and screws ... The widigos wouldn't also drop chems? I kind of sell those.. guns, ammo, drugs and screws.. my character may be a drug dealer ü§î
---
Regular crappy raider power armor looks like something that was salvaged and put to work.
---
That's a good idea as I've been done with the run for like a month now
---
September 9th the DLC for The Outer Worlds comes out so I will be there instead of Fallout 76.
---
Nothing but mounted radroach plans.
---
Went to camps several times only to find one star armor with unyielding they want 4K to 10k for it or they are selling a nocturnal fixer for 10k 
---
And bloodied level 35 handmade one star 15k seriously wtf
---
I‚Äôm almost tempted to start destroying these bases with that special trick
---
Didn‚Äôt someone already post this. I remember someone commenting about UV light and hotel rooms.
---
Wow.
---
Good luck finding one. Wish there was cross play. üëç
---
Made a post about this earlier and requested a refund. Got it the same day, at least they were very quick on this.
---
I also feel the need to say that the way I've designed this build, its a real chore to get it equipped with gear. If that worries you and is off putting, I highly suggest taking the Chinese stealth suit route. It simplifies things a lot but you sacrifice your tankiness you get from the normal armor.
---
Same that's why we need this post up there
---
The exact opposite thing happened with the Blood Eagle Nest last week. Everything you place inside wants to sink into the floor.
---
I‚Äôm one of those errrrr... hated bloodied stealth commando. I also chugged chems, bobblehead and magazine for this. Took me ~700 bullets.
---
Thanks!
---
Yah shes fine. Me and her hubby helped her rebuild. She had no idea she had done anything wrong (technically she didnt) and quite frankly Im tenting there because nukes dont hurt tents. 
---
Thesda needs to limit build there, or fix the raincoat guys spawn. I guess nuking camps there is a 'thing' for people who assume that ppl build there to fuck up the spawn.  Now theres a tent there to fuck up the spawn.
---
Need pretty lights when plotting down fall of capitalist swine.
---
Theres the motel cannibals
---
~~Well to be fair that includes dogs~~.  But even including the dogs you get more overall XP in less time at Westek.  Go count it.
---
Edit:  My run just now I counted 56 super mutants and 18 dogs inside and outside Westek.  Took 4 minutes.
---
My bloody explosive fixer had it once, until it broke and I had to repair it. I traded someone for it and it was already there for some reason.
---
Yeah that's neat, but I am talking about an actual faction. A big questline.
---
The link to the no-clip documentary was footnoted as supporting some statement on the wiki but when I actually watched it, it didn't really seem to support their conclusion so I tuned out.  I guess I'll have to sit back through it.
---
I believe there are quotes specifying that the crystals grow on the human Scorched but now that you actually mention it I am no longer certain.  This is the section from the wiki:
---
"In addition to the shriveled, burned skin typical of ghouls, the Scorched possess green crystalline growths throughout their body, piercing through their skin in irregular patterns; these are ultracite shards, formed as a byproduct of the fungus growing inside of them."
---
However, there is no citation as to where they found this information.  The above is part of a larger paragraph that has a citation to the Ounce of Prevention quest (https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Ounce_of_Prevention) but a casual examination of the quest page showed nothing to back it up.
---
I did find this document, from Dr. Claire Hudson found at the Morgantown airport:
---
"I'd love to give a detailed explanation of what the Scorched plague is and how it works, but right now, we know so little, it just wouldn't be possible. Frankly, it's damn frustrating.
---
What we do know is that living creatures that come into contact with a Scorchbeast sometimes begin to mutate. The victim's skin turns dark, almost black, with the smell of ash.
---
Some kind of biochemical process takes hold at this point. Lesions that burn with intense heat begin to form on the victim's body. The affected creature appears to be covered in smoldering embers."
---
The "smoldering embers" could be the Ultracite crystals...or maybe not.
---
I found surprisingly little of interest in Dr. Hudson's notes from AVR, though I did find this tidbit:
---
"Inoculation Project Overview
---
PURPOSE:
---
Produce a vaccine against the mutagenic effect known as the Scorched plague."
---
They literally used the two terms interchangeably, as if they were completely unaware that they were medically distinct.
---
I did spot one interesting thing while going through the logs.  Ghouls, mole rats and wolves were resistant to the Scorched plague (very resistant presumably as they are what we used to make the vaccine/inoculation) while the only other creatures shown to be infected by it were fog crawlers, mirelurks and cave crickets.
---
Odd that it would mostly affect insects/crustaceans while not working well on mammals (except humans which it apparently did great in).  Working well in humans but NOT in human ghouls is also interesting.
---
Well spotted on the fact that only human Scorched petrify or develop the crystals.  It's one of those things that was instantly obvious to me once you had said it but which I had completely overlooked up to that point.
---
As to whether it has some relationship to human Ghoulism...I haven't heard anyone else bring it up and can't find any data on it.  I do know that Ghoulism has been observed in humans, gorillas, and American black bears.  Unfortunately we aren't exactly swimming in specimens of those last two so opportunity for research is nearly zero :(
---
I had been under the impression that Ultracite itself was an artificially produced material that AMS created using atomic bombs under ground.  Further research indicates that AMS did produce artificial Ultracite by this method but that it was naturally a naturally occurring material.
---
It's properties are...vague at best.  It is described as "coal-like" in that it is basically just burned (Poseidon Energy Plant WV-06 - Turbine Hall terminal entry "Ultracite Refit").  It is also called "radioactive glass" by the miners that worked with it.  According to the Free States it is only mildly radioactive at rest but according to the AMS people it gives off enormous amounts of radioactivity (type unspecified) when burned.
---
It's a game and they aren't scientists and it's an alternate universe where physics are different...but I am a Chemist and I can tell you that is very odd behavior indeed.  While burning certain materials (magnesium metal for example) does release ultraviolet radiation, that's just basically high frequency light.
---
Gamma radiation is also just (much higher) high frequency light but I have never heard of it being emitted by any oxidation reaction.  It is generally only emitted during nuclear reactions (typically only take place in stars and the like) or radioactive decay.
---
So, from a scientific standpoint in this universe, Ultracite is magic.  Without detailed information as to its atomic and molecular structures, which won't be forthcoming as it is fictional/magic, I can't go any further in that direction :(
---
*We can‚Äôt patch that, it‚Äôs a load bearing bug.*
---
Cool, thank you.
---
Is the helmet a random drop from Big Earl, or do you find it somewhere in his cave? I rly want it lol
---
Is the event active on PS4?
---
I rather they switch out the daily‚Äôs after you complete them to earn 10 atoms each. 150 atom would be 3750 points if converted to score.
---
I was being completely serious. 
---
Bethesda is focusing to much on the Communist stuff. When will they have the US Army stuff added in?: The Barricades - Wall flag - Propaganda signs etc.
---
Instead we get more commie shit.
---
When will the Responders and Free States get more attention? Sure they have some things but not nearly as much as the Raiders and Communists that's for sure. 
---
At least the Brotherhood of Steel is **finally** getting some things. I honestly feel sorry for Enclave players, all they have is an eyepatch and unrelated Power Armor paint schemes: Nuclear Winter. They need some love as well.
---
...wut
---
Can you shoot thought it like a normal fence? Does it stop turrents from auto aiming?
---
Oh that may be why then. I've never launched a nuke, but I've been in a few public parties, so that's likely. Thanks
---
I managed to do it once got a cursed harpoon with bash damage fml so I don‚Äôt think I want to start one again until they fix it.
---
fuck running through that damn bunker to start the event only to have it mess up
---
The FO4 M1 Garand mod was one of my favorites. Very well balanced. The M1 Carbine mod was also really fun.
---
That is real nice, for a change.
---
PC only
---
That would also be good! I need atoms but hopefully they will add a system to earn atoms or give us free tiers for the next season
---
They would never do this because they want the people who were dumb enough to buy their way thru the season early on to do the same next season.
---
HAHA ITS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS..... a big mistake
---
the nerf to the builds that aren't bloodied wont be anywhere near as drastic though. you don't even need a "build" to do big damage anyway.
---
just pc right now. They are testing on pc first and sometime later this week they are planning on releasing it on consoles. thats if they fix the current issues
---
There is a reason they rush you out of the mine at the end.  They don't want you getting all those screws and ammo.  It's just a tease.
---
Thats why we need to get this up there to show them and maybe they'll actually consider this. It's worth a shot.
---
Battle bot already does this. Should be done.
---
Prepare for the future!
---
Iirc the camp stuff wasn‚Äôt all that great, some flashing lights, a ambulance stretcher as a bed and some signs
---
'I am become death' was one of them. Someone must've launched a nuke causing it to complete though. Didn't know that was a final quest until now
---
You still complete it just stand in the radiation for a few minutes , but kiss your junk goodbye
---
There already "was". That's what the Gourmands were in the main questline. And that's what the wendigos are.
---
I want a USA collectron that says anti communist stuff
---
[](/americanlunasalute)I can see supporting any faction in the wasteland, Brotherhood, Enclave, Free States, Responders, Raiders, and even the Mistresses more than the god forsaken commies. They invaded Alaska, They started this war, and **They** plunged the world into it's final decline.  
---
  
---
Any of you sympathizers use this commie stuff at your camp I'm not buying any of your stuff. As is my right as a highly irradiated Murican.
---
Get thee to a Cannery!  wise men know well enough what Colossal monsters you make of them.
---
That‚Äôs awesome. Hopefully you didn‚Äôt steal it from fuzzy Brenda
---
I think the original main point was that OP was frustrated and seeking validation. My point was the PTS feedback was largely ignored, and that the release, promotion and release and then delay was bungled, which it was, which is also extremely common for this arm of Bethesda based on what I have seen the past two years here. 
---
&gt; this patch actually did heavily address other bugs and included a number of bug fixes and reversions.
---
Such as? [Here are the hotfix notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2uZWTGKr44jRhx8wuCaGU8/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-august-18-2020):
---
&gt; Settler Forager: Players can now correctly receive Daily Quests from the Settler Forager Ally.
---
 - Allies not giving quests properly has been an issue that still remains fully unresolved since Wastelanders dropped in May. They have fixed and unfixed it a couple of times without ever fully resolving it. Time will tell I guess. 
---
&gt; Walls: Players can now correctly replace solid Walls with Doorway Walls when building in their C.A.M.P.s.
---
- A fix based on their recent camp change that pissed off the majority of the building community and was unknown to the community and not asked for. I have yet to fully test this "fix". 
---
&gt; Exploit: Addressed a C.A.M.P. budget exploit related to Small Generators.
---
&gt; Secret Service Armor: Pocketed and Deep Pocketed Mods for Secret Service Armor limbs can now correctly be purchased from Regs using Gold Bullion.
---
  - Patch notes last patch indicated this was included so they just fucked up (again). 
---
&gt; Underarmor: The Brotherhood of Steel Fatigues are now correctly categorized as Underarmor, rather than an outfit.
---
 - Another reward incorrectly implemented from the get go that they fixed. This happens frequently. 
---
&gt; From Russia with Lev: Fixed an issue that prevented players from entering the Spruce Knob Boat Rental at Spruce Knob Lake.
---
 - Also a bug introduced by their recent patch:
---
Map: The player‚Äôs C.A.M.P. Icon now correctly remains visible on the Map after equipping the Future-Tec C.A.M.P. Module Skin.
---
 - A bug introduced with seasons on a reward that takes about 40 hours to unlock and it took this long to fix!? 
---
[Not to mention the issues with todays atom shop items.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic4jzx/psa_there_are_a_number_of_glaring_issues_with_the/) 
---
So sure technically they do fix things, just the wrong things, slowly, and in addition to fixing things that is on nobodys radar. Its like the lead engineer calling up from the engine room of a sinking ship saying they fixed the squeaky hatch that was annoying everyone. Nobody gives a fuck, fix the hole in the boat moron.
---
it's under casual underarmor, not secret service
---
We all remember how Wastelanders came out bug free and polished. You can't trick us.
---
We should be able to build them and scrip machines at our CAMP
---
Chest reward
---
Yeah I mean an actual questline. Not raiders though, actual people that don't think like a 15 y/o teen
---
I thought I found here there as well, with a backpack near the corpse .  But near the Hunters shack
---
Yeah, that could've ended up badly!
---
Wild. I didn‚Äôt know those existed! I just started playing last month.
---
Yes only on pc. Supposed to be released on console later in the week.
---
Do we know if there will be extra challenges or if challenges will have extra score?
---
Good luck with your grind too. üéÆ
---
Just today I found a level 234 player with 7 vendors just full of trash. So much stuff it had to be fully 90% of his stash space.
---
Some highlights include serums for 5k, mininukes for 100 caps, and nearly 100 random vanilla weapons, not even rarer ones, (I'm talking recoil compensated pipe rifles, standard assault rifles, etc) for base value.
---
I feel like they may have been dropped on their head as a child.
---
this has just put a road block on my alts main quest.
---
at least i'v done it before but for new players this could be turning away huge amounts of players, this needs to be a priority YESTERDAY
---
That‚Äôs true, especially considering the games been out for nearly 2 years and lots of people already have great weapons and armor. Every time I see someone on Reddit post about a god-tier weapon they got from a vendor (like a BE Gatling Plasma) for like 5k caps I vendor hop and am 99% of the time disappointed. The only notable thing I found was some god-roll armor pieces for cheap but it was trash armor like Raider and Trapper.
---
Stash all your legendarys on another character and then you're good
---
I think it's literally called 'The Man Who Could Sit Anywhere'
---
However, I know for a fact that raiders always shoot first. ;)
---
Why would I buy communist stuff anyways? :v
---
Omg I actually have to try üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
That would be awesome but wouldn‚Äôt make much sense
---
If you want the l50 wait till ur l50 and do the quest, like any other quest rewards smh, if u have a quest reward prior to completing the quest you won't receive it again
---
I saw the same idea earlier today too.
---
I'm on now, if I'm up that way, I'll take a look
---
Not really interested in any of the rewards. Too bad cursed wasn't rolled on any weapon randomly.
---
Pipe weapons should have never been an end tier weapon tupe. Weapon and armor classes/types need to be linear, the fact that you get pipe weapons or golf clubs at the end game is ridiculous.
---
I have done every quest in the game
---
Bloodied nerf is not live. Git good.
---
It sounds like the best event they‚Äôve added. Too bad it‚Äôs been delayed thrice and is still suffering serious issues.
---
You raise a valid point here. Have my upvote.
---
Do it. They should refund you, no problem. Don't let the other negative replies sway you. They have refunded me 3 times without issue, just be nice about it.
---
By the end of the week.
---
EATT the Establishment of Appalatchian Taste Testers
---
Do exist and have made some sort of Mark. Have a bite.
---
#PreyEATTlove
---
Congrats! I‚Äôve done this a number of times since Fallout 1st launched. If you have a day to kill, it‚Äôs a month worth of resources.
---
Emote to someone saying my bad and let them blast you. Hope they leave your loot bag as well, or stash all loot before you pick a lock.
---
As for currents news on it, haven‚Äôt heard anything in my network.
---
Screws
---
Alternatively, just making the cap weekly instead of daily would help. One less thing to have to do every day.
---
Came across my first the other day on the white springs golf course. Luckily a high level player was standing outside warning people from entering. A few minutes later someone nuke it lol
---
What does ads mean? I keep seeing it.
---
They're trash imo. They should have made it so cursed dropped on any weapon with any roll. Then I'd have a reason to do the event.
---
The Glowsight perk doesn‚Äôt work on the Wendigo Spawn or the Colossus
---
Lmao that‚Äôs probably true!
---
I‚Äôll sell a really decent 2-3 star weapon at max level for 2-3k caps. Armors at most 1k for 3star pieces of combat armor or better. Ammo is absolutely always one cap a round except plasma cores which are 20 caps fully charged. Any weaker guns or armor I‚Äôll usually sell for 100-500 caps depending on usefulness. Camp plans are 25 caps unless they are rare or offer deeper functionality such as lighting or wall sets. Chems and stims are 10 caps each. Really common plans/mods I‚Äôll put in for 1cap or free. 
---
My vendor stuff flys off the shelves and it keeps my stash weight low. I see no reason to jack prices up, especially considering how low the caps max is.
---
Edited for readability
---
But... it‚Äôs cool to flex on people.
---
Who's dropping the nukes?
---
This is why you need good BA‚Äôs like me to set the devs priorities and do backlog management etc ensuring the right stuff gets done between the various groups
---
Forgot spruce knob (lol)
---
I believe that bundle is in the AS once every month.
---
I was in a big group with mates so we all was
---
My camp is right in the middle of the map and has good shopping atmosphere so I can sell pretty much anything quickly at any price. I still keep my prices pretty low, but I only just recently switched my 5.56 to one cap, before I sold it at 2 and people bought it
---
idk, i kind of like the look the clipping gives off lol.
---
No it's secret service, always was. The description in atomshop was just an typo and they already changed it (look at atomshop). Also, the issue with them is fixed on PTS and it takes SS linings.
---
The problem is that there really is no good way to gauge what things are worth. The design of the game makes it really hard to comparison shop and no one's come up with any website to gather data.  If we ever get Mods, something will likely pop up quickly, but for now we're all just sorta throw shit at a wall and seeing what sticks.
---
None what so ever üòÜüòÜüòÜ
---
Eh i think theres other stuff that needs to be added long before a cannibal group gets even considered.
---
There's already effects for 4 and 5 stars they just haven't implemented them into the game yet.
---
I'm nice like that
---
An eternity and then some.
---
Yeah I think this is the biggest reason. Cannibals gotta get behind in line to others, with the first being BoS so it seems
---
And they should also have a trade menu just like borderlands 2.
---
Ok?
---
That's Ella Ames corpse.
---
There should be some sort of timer. As long as you have killed or tagged something recently then I think you should be able to receive xp from your friends kills.
---
This means that when you and your team mates do a dungeon together you can both work together and not worry about it becoming a kill steal competition. But it won't allow for leeches to join a team and sit there gaining xp. 
---
Also it should be location based. This would encourage people in public teams to actually, you know, team up a bit!
---
My finger hurts
---
I get what you're trying to say, trust me, I'm frustrated too but trying to be more productive rather than just oversimplifying the issues.
---
What I think you're missing about what I'm saying is that everyone had a different "hole" they're screaming about getting fixed.
---
Whatever devs are devoted to this quest - their hole is getting this fixed and working with as little issue as possible.
---
The devs they said they had devoted to new CAMP/workshop features used to be the same team that was working on NW, so NW is on back burner and now they have a new hole. 
---
I'm sure the primary team are working on the BOS stuff that's supposed to be coming down the line. Another group is working on stuff we don't even know about yet which will be after BoS. Another person or two coming up with atom shop stuff (this person is likely a designer but not a dev because much of the stuff isn't properly play tested). Which probably leaves a single guy in the basement of atx who had no familiarity with Fallout 4 base code that is trying to fix not just new issues in 76 but spaghetti attach scripts that have been broken for years before they even started. 
---
Watching the lead devs talk recently you get a better understanding of things, they say themselves that releasing the content is what they're focused on and when stuff goes live that's when they respond to community.  This all besides probably daily zeni business calls yelling about how to make the game make more money and cost less.
---
I've worked with a number of game developers and it's almost always a shitshow. It's never as fluid and simple as just fixing things the way each individual user on this sub would prefer and end of the day, there's no way to make everyone happy.
---
Good one ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Can do this with psycho buff right now for sure. Just take one and drop below the boost when it wears off you'll be at zero.
---
They are all the enemies that spawn that aren't the boss or main objective
---
The fence is cool besides the gap under it but other than that I love it.  The bunker is another issue all together.  I bought the bundle before I knew the bunker was such crap.  Does anyone think they will fix the bunker?
---
newsflash idiots, typewriters, desk fans, toy cars/trucks, giddyup buttercup and many other items contain screws. they're literally everywhere. 
---
farming materials isn't difficult if you know how to mark junk for search.
---
edit. rarest junk item my arse. no junk item is actually rare. you just need to know what items contains the junk you're looking for. ffs. with one single server sweep you can literally be in the 4.5k mark for each junk item. i know this from my own experience
---
another edit. I have a scrapbox so I can afford it.
---
So you're saying fully automated luxury gay space communism is coming? Sign me up bro.
---
Yeah but on a long enough time line you'll have so many score points racked up that you'll be done with the season before it even starts. They definitely need to consider offering something once players are done with the current season, but I'm not sure that XP toward the next season is it.
---
Perhaps Tencent are taking a run at Bethesda üò¨
---
I came here to suggest the same thing.
---
It‚Äôs a public event. If you don‚Äôt like the people who show up you can always skip it.
---
Ah gotcha
---
Drill
---
You don,t understand. They are not going to Buff anything. They are not nerfing just OP Weapons The are Nerfing everything. It is live on the PTS.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KCZp4qPUKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KCZp4qPUKE)
---
Probably an oversight.  Report it as a bug and maybe, eventually, it gets fixed.
---
Im not saying one way or the other, but let me ask you this.. Would you really be at all that surprised if it did?
---
Don't forget the fucking door shows closed even though its "open" so you have to open and close it twice to open again. JUST LIKE THE DAMN RED ROCKET GARAGE DOOR. God dammit Bethesda! Get your shit together and fix the underlying issue instead of having people purchase the same BULLSHIT.
---
How do you go about requesting a refund?  I use steam and not the Bethesda launcher
---
It's at least and idea for what the future could be. Hopefully they come up with a solution.
---
Yes.
---
I would even be willing to have a system where you can scrap a legendary and have a one in whatever chance of retaining that legendary module.  Or if that's not doable even a system where you can scrap legendaries and get a random legendary module.
---
I heard from people a secret that non other has heard before. It will bring englightment to the darkest recesses of your mind and body.
---
The enlightenment is as follows : Try not to die.
---
Yes I know it may be tough to not follow such a path. But our god Todd has other plans.
---
Greater plans for the future.
---
Yeah, maybe that's why it's important there should be more content for Wastelanders. To see the players be the force that drives each the raiders and/or the settlers would be very entertaining. This story in appalachia is amazing for the lore of fallout 76 in the long run but it needs more focus. Ultimately I agree with you.
---
 The player never does enough to pardon. There isn't good enough reason to justify Meg not lashing back out at us. Maybe, Meg knows her and her group won't really be hurt by that loss in the beginning. They know they would be able to claim more of the gold in the treasury in the long run. I don't know though. Just thinking out loud.
---
It would be a lot cooler if there was an actual game faction. It's like the fake enclave roleplayers or the fake BOS ones.
---
Uranium fever is a steel and black titanium farm with 3 guaranteed legendaries I don't know why anyone would AFK it
---
This would not be fair to those who don't grind xp daily.
---
They are just the bunker has like a floating floor you place everything down on and the door has crappy reused sound effects, bought this pack hoping for a lot and got let down as a result
---
neat
---
No. You don't tell *me* how to play *my* game pal.
---
Yeah, if you are wanted, you can't see other players or their camps/vendors on the map, but you get flagged as wanted on the map and have a bounty. That's about it. It hasn't changed since launch as far as I'm aware.
---
ETA: The only way to clear it is for someone to kill you and claim the bounty.
---
When you join a Public Event, the loading screen has a brief introduction to how that event works (though it can be hard to catch if you load fast). Your pip-boy can also give you a bit more information on what to do, but generally the event objectives in your top right corner and the in-game quest markers will explain the mechanics relatively well. If anything still confuses you, I recommend finding that event in the Wiki and reading how it works. Some events can be a bit confusing your first time around, so I wouldn't stress it.
---
He just put a new video up on YouTube today.
---
Yup. :(
---
It was released on PC only. Consoles will get it later, not sure on the date.
---
*The negotiator*
---
And after a month they'll finally bring it to console
---
He just posted a video 2 hours ago about the best use of gold bullion.
---
Omg and I get excited when I have 2000 .50 rounds for my final word... 1000 is usually all I need for a silo run. But 15000? That's gonna take me so long to accumulate :(
---
He stated a couple days ago on Twitter he has been working on a massive project involving the gold bullion rewards. He also said he was spending more time with family and has begun working out to get in better shape
---
BOS, Enclave, more settlements
---
All I needed to know. Thanks a lot!
---
I know he's on twitch. Also according to his Twitter he's still active in the wastelands.
---
Yes, from an assaultron with a mouth like a garbage disposal. That s the equivalent of how I feel about this game right now.
---
Any solutions for the people who are already done then?
---
or, buy it, then immediately ask for a refund because all the broken shit.
---
Unlikely.  First, most people aren't going to be interested in/support that sort of thing.  Second, it's an impractical and unsustainable "life style."  Third, in Fallout it turns you into Wendigos, making it even less desirable/practical/sustainable.
---
True, they have had attention from some people in Bethesda studios, through the CHAD fallout 76 podcasting.
---
So, people in certain places of the world are struggling for gay rights, while others are allowed to have sex changes at 9 yrs old, and youd be surprised about an automated luxury gay commie space party?
---
You guys are really still surprised by things?
---
I guess you haven't played any other fallout game.
---
Man. This might kill the game for me...
---
Honestly don't see the point, most people go there for the dailys anyway, and Foundation is in quite a central place. Those 10 caps for the fast travels are hardly a thing either.
---
The vault, though, they should add one there.
---
The drop kill from their house can
---
Seems to always be an issue with these buildings.
---
The Red Rocket Garage has a similar issue with the walls, at least on a section outside. Haven't checked all the walls for this.
---
As a PA heavy gunner this was always hard to do when all my guns would shred pretty much anything and I‚Äôm not even bloodied or junkies. I eventually just started carrying around a non legendary mini gun with an accelerated barrel and shredder mod to reduce my effective range as much as I could to keep damage numbers down. Really only whip out the better guns for mob heavy events like line in the sand, project paradise and sbq
---
Oh wow...didnt know that. Thanks!!
---
Welp, that explains it! Thanks for trying though. 
---
If youre still interested, i can make sure youre signed up for when it goes down?
---
Where is the event located at? I haven't played much 76 since survival
---
Armor kinda went in the shitter when the Secret Service Armor came out. Most people put their resources into getting the roll they want on that. Good pieces listed dirt cheap still sit for ages. I scrip it now or drop it at a train station if im hurting for space
---
I was super lucky to find a ton of unyielding armor at 300c each. bought the lot. some of it even low level, which I consider even more valuable *thAn* level 50.
---
Nah I'll sign myself up for the gay space communism party if it ever exists.
---
Holy crap. I built one and didn't even notice. I guess I always have way too much wood on hand.
---
It‚Äôs been in notes from Bethesda regarding the One Wasteland update, but here it is in an article from May:
---
[https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/](https://massivelyop.com/2020/05/28/fallout-76-interview-bethsoft-on-one-wasteland-text-chat-and-other-radioactive-topics/)
---
They might back off on this, but seeing as a decent number of players seem polarized on this, I‚Äôm figuring they will keep on track to remove the hunger and thirst penalties. My hope is an eventual Survival Mode return that, instead of just being a PvP mode like it was in the past, is geared around more difficult combat (like needing to seriously avoid damage and rebalancing weapons so high-powered rifle rounds hit harder than hitting an enemy with a melee weapon) and survival elements like thirst, hunger, fatigue, and disease have gameplay repercussions. Mute legendary effects or eliminate them only in that mode somehow and I‚Äôd be seriously happy, but that won‚Äôt be done, even if it could be pulled off by the devs. There are more important things to work on, though, so this is honestly a wish that I kinda don‚Äôt want fulfilled given that this game will always have a mighty pile of things that need fixing. New enemies or events are justifiable additions while there are problems, since they inject gameplay so fun can be had while problems persist, at least. Creating a revamped survival mode for those of us who like some RP in our RPGs is of low priority and kinda should be.
---
At least you can do the event..
---
Awwww he help hoomans!
---
"A number of glaring issues" - Fallout 76 *past, present, and future*.
---
I haven't been able to even do this event.  2 out of 3 times now joining the event has put me outside a mine blocked with rubble.  The other time I ran in and there was no one else there.
---
Thanks, I guess I will run around naked until someone shoots me, I heard that is the way to tell the other players to kill me right?
---
Kinda shitty if a paid item was deemed not as important to fix...
---
Dude youre dreaming. Why would anyone put the caps into the recipe and gather the ingredients to sell them for 50 caps when you can get up to 400 just selling them to the train vendors? 
---
350 to 500 seems the norm to me.
---
They could go ahead and let us stim while in vats while they are at it.
---
You won't lose your junk unless you die after the event ends, so if you die on your way out of the mine your junk should be fine.
---
I don't even have my mic volume enabled, since I'm in no rush to hear 11 year olds screaming into their mic.
---
It's unbelievable that this game doesn't have Text Chat.
---
Oh my gosh!  Original Fallout BOS bunker!
---
Thank you, sir.
---
What do you mean? It‚Äôs enabled on PC, you drop a nuke on monongah mine, first 10min you can enter in groups of 8 to do the boss fight
---
this is so underrated.
---
A hero amongst dweebuses. God bless thy.
---
Shit what else they gonna play on Xbox.
---
\-Add-itional spawns.
---
You know I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get 5k for my stalkers fixer and then someone bought it
---
Someone needs a ssd....
---
I w done it 3 times and have had zero issues.
---
Play private if u don‚Äôt want people to join
---
It has no hitbox, not even the posts
---
Depends on your definition of usable. The bunker apparently isn't easy to place without it floating. Objects placed inside can float. I forgot what the issue is with the turret windows. Fences have a gap at the bottom.
---
Ive seen that with a Bobby pin and preserved pie before lol
---
It can be hard to price an odd item right, for example an Explosive Handmade but with a perk like Zealots or so. But yeah some people sell the items that really nobody uses, for ridiculous prices.
---
Thats why I collect 'You have been insulted!' notes, to drop at those camps.
---
No wonder I never found it before, it's barely visible!
---
Oh right, because I didn't fire over 2k .50 call rounds at it dealing a large percentage of the damage or anything.
---
Is "jackass" better?  I mean, that is the kind of comment you made.
---
Just sell scrip to NPC vendors. You‚Äôll get more
---
VTU endorses Cannibalism as part of it's Curriculum.
---
It's on one of the Terminals on Campus.
---
Come on man you're on a Fallout Reddit...Everyone here simps for Capitalism while playing a game that is one giant satire of Capitalism. Logic is inverted here.
---
Old dailies and weeklies come back with atoms.
---
Also?  This discussion is waaaaaay more interesting than "Inflict so much damage that none of the mechanics matter".
---
That‚Äôs a huge chip on your shoulder, man. Miller gave you the best advice possible, because that means that person just wasted their nuke card and the silo run time.
---
And it‚Äôs even better when you log back in after the nuke hits and have no damage to your camp and they are still out of luck.
---
Also, I did indicate it was my first time doing it.  So no, clearly haven't tried not dying in the last ten seconds of the battle.  I guess I should have died earlier in the battle.  Then I would have deserved it more somehow? "Logic"
---
Todd Howard here, we at Bethesda are working towards streamlining the appeal ticket process. Rest assured we are hiring the best Indian intern to sort and respond to the thousands of request we receive a day, at his current rate he might reach your ticket in about 4-6 business weeks. This is Todd Howard signing out and i hope to see you in the Atomic Wastelands^(tm) soon.
---
Lol ok buddy.
---
So you can shoot though it? And my turrets will aim though it?
---
None of the limitations in the game serve any benefit other than to slow down gameplay and halt progression. There is absolutely no reason we should be able to farm out easily triple the gold bullion a day than we can. Why is there a cap limit, why is there a scrip limit, a gold limit? It serves no purpose other than to force you to do your daily login quests. If we could get everything we wanted in a day nobody would play because we'd burn through the content too fast.
---
I had to put mine inside my seedy shed where my vendors at. Doesn‚Äôt clip in there
---
Eh. I think we could use more cap sinks
---
MUST
---
This weapon is underestimated. I did maybe 100 levels with it plus a fast swinging baseball bat.
---
Thing is, explosives like these grenades don't lose power because of range, so, all hits are good, and they cripple enemies easily.
---
You can tag everything, and a single grenade can kill five or six minions. If you add the perks which buff damage and area damage, you get really, really strong. 
---
Plus, they are the ultimate weapon for events. 
---
If you find a bloodied or instigating + 33 vats + reduced weight, you'll see.
---
Wait until they are released would be step 1.
---
It can take a few days after you sub for the atoms to come through or it could be instant. I believe it might be something to do with them checking that the bank has authorised the payment to go through.
---
they only exist in the test servers ( pc only)
---
I agree you shouldn't have to.
---
But thought I'd share the workaround on the off chance you wanted the achievement.
---
It does depend on who else is there though. Other day I was in line of the sand, was planning to solo the dang thing but 2 lv 30s jumped in.
---
They were on same team.
---
So I dutifully swapped over to my QE 10 mm I use precisely for events, and watched scorched roll over these 2 guys not even make a dent in each wave.
---
A few lv 70s to 90s joined, so I figured I'd just let the low lvs play here and focus on the SBs, so they dont die to her. But these guys are just not holding the scorched back. It was getting ridiculous the number of times the device was breaking, and the amount of scorched just *not* dying to peashooters.
---
So out comes the big gun. It's my event again, sorry.
---
You've got my vote
---
That‚Äôs a damn good price, if you‚Äôre on PC I‚Äôd buy out your stock everyday.
---
Go to Lucky Hole Mine a couple times, do Lode Baring and Breach &amp; Clear, and have the right perks enabled (I want to say Ammosmith and Super Duper) when you step up to your Tinker's Bench. 10 lead = 180 rounds.
---
Hehe, indeed!
---
What's the point of living if you're not flexing every single day on people around you?
---
It's definitely a blueprint big then, what pieces are attached to the blueprint itself? It's usually just as easy as recreating that lol
---
I'm on xbox
---
1. Nope goes on dirt
---
2. Same as a small genny
---
3. Heights pretty tall inside, can Def fit power armor station, though it might need to be closers towards the center
---
Good call!
---
It‚Äôs not enabled on consoles just yet
---
It's a public event that's designed for high level players only.
---
Just wait for the new damage system and One Wasteland combo...
---
50 to 250 is what I have paid for serums from private vendors, I own a bunch of recipes but have never crafted one. It's easier to buy them and there is better money in chems and guns. Purified water might be better money too, you should check that out. Sorry if I made you mad, I did find one vendor that will sell you one of each for 69c .. after that it's 250.
---
Sounds like a bad day.
---
I‚Äôm only level 39 with 5 luck (dunno if it works like FO4). I was so excited :&lt;
---
Hol up. Last time a checked a video with this name it was not a pretty sight.
---
If you have the rare colour bats, you will drive some uninformed players crazy (they just drop, cant be crafted).
---
I used to run a museum with a character and toys look good, so do masks and hats.
---
Heyyyyyy! At least someone understands! These comments were scaring me.
---
Got it at my second run, first was the plushie. It's a reward for completing the event like the Blue Ridge clothing
---
Let‚Äôs hope so.
---
Would love more Free States and Enclave content.
---
But at least you tried man, like if the event is gonna fail, the obviously you gotta step up. I was doing free range, and I'm not low level, but right now I don't have good guns. The bramin was like lowest 75% health, and the sheepsquatch spawned and was dead instantly. Like the dude just waited for it and didn't even bother letting anyone get a hit in.
---
How did it kill you?
---
I promise that you'll be amazed!
---
Everyone disliked you calling it like it is.
---
My heavy gunner with a I33 would say differently. One shotting full health enemies from a mile away is honestly OP.  Not to mention harpoon guns don‚Äôt seem to effect stealth nearly as much as other heavy guns. Harpoon sneak sniper is a legit top tier build IMO, as long as you have another heavy gun to switch to when is comes time for SBQ or other endgame bosses.
---
I'm 0 for 2. I died and I guess he was killed before I could respawn so I respawned outside of the mine and got nothing. My second attempt I crashed to the desktop, oddly enough, I think that's the first time this has happened in over a year of playing.
---
I did it for the first time today. It was fun. Everyone getting feared was pretty hilarious.
---
Board games don't display well, some of them are too big for the glass.
---
I would love a mix between Militaristic and Casual clothing, kinda like the Bog Wanderer but a little more tactical without a big ass pouch on the belly.
---
Also is there a link for all the Fallout 4 creations clubs creations?
---
Heh just traded my left nut for a bfssa ripper for the lolz
---
Not so surprising. They wonder how things become the way they are, but never question themselves or the way they may be (or not be) thinking.
---
This seems like a new big people are exploiting. Someone in my last match spawned turret pillars and their camp in the lobby! Play a bit of nuclear winter, never seen this until today.
---
No need to be uncivil if you disagree with someone‚Äôs statement.
---
Heh my base is on a legendary spawn point. Happens all the time. The worst and it's a dayly occurrence is the dam sheepsquach.
---
Which is completely understandable. Stuff like that were the objective is reliant on holding back hordes of enemies, totally get it. But the legendary scorchbeast that's flying around you probably at least let others get hits on so they get the loot as well.
---
Ran it like 10 times now and still missing Mask, Heads &amp; Plushie
---
They‚Äôre games work though
---
It takes me 3 mins to clear west tek I‚Äôve already done the math on it myself.  Unless you can clear it in like 2 mins it‚Äôs not viable.
---
If we need to pick locks, I'm voting Morgantown as I actually know where a reliable one is that nobody else gets to most of the time haha
---
I do like Flatwoods though as it's easier to get in the top 10 without hiding
---
So cursed B2525 fixer isn't possible?
---
Geez no wonder, the lobby had turrets going crazy and then in game I kept getting surrounded by barricades and turrets..
---
Your point is logical. But it is also logical to think that Bethesda thinks illogically. This is why they won't listen to you.
---
This is why you don't put your CAMP on the right side of the map until you're level 50
---
Kill lower level enemies to get guns at your level and you'll waste less ammo
---
"Where the fuck did the body go?" for Encryptid
---
New bug fixing patch, new game breaking bugs. Typical Bethesda. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Hellfire.
---
But the Matte Black from Fallout 3 &amp; 4, not the Hot Sauce flavor in this game.
---
Yes that guy sounds like he was just being a jerk, though I'm sure the players didn't recognize that I was "saving" the event from failure in my situation, either.
---
I've had similar experience with Free Range. People seem to be more trigger happy in that, or maybe it's because Sheepsquatch hp is very low. One or the other, as I've noticed it too.
---
Did you complete the story? It was an attempt to find the Queens nest but it was ineffective so thats why you had to help MODUS because he was able to locate it using the Kovac-Muldoon platform.
---
No no, you shouldn‚Äôt have to have this burden either, nobody should. I however, am a hero of sorts, so I will carry this burden.
---
My latest character is fully mutated.  I did it level 5 to 10. I had 3 pieces of unyielding so she leveled really quick and I didn't want to spend a couple hours killing myself, it gets boring fast. So I gradually mutated my self while playing. There is not much disadvantage other than I can only use energy shotguns.  And it is totally free!
---
i did the event twice and had noproblem doing it fast travel to it i hit the tag for event .
---
Not that I know of. Sorry.
---
Well you do have the Thompson, it‚Äôs just called the sub machine gun.
---
I had a similar thing the other day, and it was because my PA refused to use a new fusion core when the one it was using ran dry.    I had to get rid of all the partially used cores in my inventory, get out of the PA, and manually put a new one in by opening it‚Äôs inventory like a container.
---
Worked fine after that, haven‚Äôt had problems since.   Try that.
---
I was so excited for the bunker when it got datamined... was happy to see it added today...
---
Decided to wait on impulse buying it because half the stuff that gets added now have issues.
---
Thank you for this post.
---
I've avoided so much waste on things like red rocket garage for example because of posts like this.
---
Hope you can get a refund.
---
Our god Todd has appeared. His brilliant light has showed you the way out.
---
Yes
---
I think for most of us - that wouldn't be very useful.
---
I only ever sell once;  it's basically empting out my stash - figuring out to crunch the highest number of weight while hitting 150 on the dot.
---
And some Son's of Dane. I was expressly promised all the beer and partying I could handle.
---
Close the app, restart your PS4 and try again.   It happens sometimes.   It‚Äôs nowhere near as common as it used to be, but still happens.
---
Just remove the limit, or change it to a weekly limit.  Then it's not a big deal in the slightest.  
---
I'd rather remove the "Every day" part.
---
Yes and probably.
---
Go to their website and go to support. You can file a ticket.
---
Thank you! I keep seeing posts of them being released. Going to delete the post them kms. &lt;3
---
They can replace the ammo vending machines that no one has ever used on purpose.
---
Wait what are legendary perks and what do they do
---
Completely agree. If you enjoy the Garand, I highly recommend going to a used gun shop and buying one, totally worth it. It doesn‚Äôt need to look nice, just newly serviced and guaranteed by the shop, that way you stay protected if anything should fail or fall off unexpectedly. Otherwise it‚Äôs a superb gun to shoot and really lets you see what a WW2 rifleman went through everyday.
---
i only hate those builds when people one shot all the legendaries when other people are around so that it causes others to not gain any loot
---
Please record
---
Love to hate them. Hate to love them. Also tend to love loving them. How do they have such a tight grip on my feels?!
---
Yes the Carbine would be a very welcome addition.
---
PP has 3 if you‚Äôre coordinated enough
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
The whole "let's sell structures that can't be placed on foundations" is exasperating!  WHY?
---
Laughing stock of gaming? 
---
*Raid: Shadow Legends has entered the chat*
---
If it was Kazmati, they do it for the videos and are super awesome about explaining the purpose.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen once and was not impressed.
---
its actually really fun. Bring your best gear and plenty of ammo/ aid items. At least 40 stimpaks to be safe. more if possible. Bring enough for a long fight because this boss is more deadly then the queen and eats ammo for breakfast. To give you an estimate I started with 2000 2mm ammo for my two shot gauss minigun and was down to 200 by the time the event ended. 
---
The more the team works together the more fun you‚Äôll have. Iv ran it twice now. Once with my stealth commando and got stuck with a bad team. Someone showed up with a tesla rifle and my framerate went right down the toilet. Which please don‚Äôt be one of those people that show up to tag everything for screws. It ok to grab some along the way but it ruins the event for others. 
---
Then i ran it with my heavy gunner and got a team where everyone worked together. It was a blast. got crap legendarys but i did get the plan for the wendigo colossus plushie so it was worth it since it only has an 8% drop rate from what I understand. 
---
right now there is probably gonna be a lot of negative posts because it suffers from issues with the respawn bug and people where being disconnected from the server but those should hopefully be ironed out before it hits console. Definitely don‚Äôt listen to the negative and give it a few attempts. It‚Äôs a nice alternative to the queen fight.
---
I don't know why they couldn't just make it open world , with other hazards besides the drills.
---
Correct
---
I can deal with difficult to place as long as when I get it right it sits normally. The gap might be annoying it‚Äôs a shame because I really like the way the fences look. Hopefully as a community we can work out some sneaky work arounds, probably the only fix we will get.
---
I used to have a screw problem.  Then I lucked out - my new base spot has a couple of sloths that spawn pretty regularly.
---
1 month of that has completely changed my screw issue.  I think I'm sitting at ~4k or so in the scrapbox.
---
Yup. Literally bought the bunker today and realized I wasted my atoms.
---
So long as it‚Äôs not the brotherhood of Nazis I‚Äôm good. I‚Äôll take commies cause I really love the design they have for them but I do agree I would love more of the other factions in the game! They should be adding a free stuff at least every month for fallout 1st or update but hey that‚Äôs another thread üê∏
---
I‚Äôll probably be rebuilding my base in a week or two so I guess I‚Äôll find out how painful it‚Äôs going to be.
---
Its not fixed. My screen is still black on my alt. Wasnt even trying to join the event when it went black. Was going from my camp to another.
---
the 8 treasury notes (80g) would be worth more - if it wasn't tied to the daily cap.
---
Maybe one of the ideas will inspire them if they ever read it, i just think these ideas would improve the game overall. I don't like to be cynical, even though i kinda understand those who are.
---
I also know there is a lot of technical challenges the team has to face, including staying on the same version as each other over a distance and having to constantly redownload the 60+ gb game to continue have updated builds.
---
So it slows the whole process down and it makes sense that they are behind schedule for content they already have planned so the chances of my idea even being implemented are pretty slim when they already are behind schedule.
---
However i still hold out the hope when the dev team is running on all cylinders again that maybe they could include upgraded content like this since many areas of the game still need improvement, even the perk card selection screen vs move a perk at level 50+ was only ever supposed to be temporary so even that needs changing.
---
I just want the best version of fallout 76 possible that rewards players working together in teams and some easy ideas to make exploration more fun and have more uses for items that would otherwise be useless.
---
All of these things, seem like reasonable additions if you want to expound upon the world that is already there and reward playing the game together. So when a player asks you what is there to do at endgame for Fallout 76, you won't have little to say.
---
If that's true we can at least take solace in the thought that they will be the first against the wall when the revolution comes.
---
That worked! Thanks! I didn't even notice that was happening until you mentioned it, but that's what it was. Got out, dropped my cores, picked them back up, and then got back in the armor and he shoved a core in before getting in.
---
It‚Äôs always bad till you get something decent. Then she pulls you back in to keep trying.
---
üò∞ü•∫
---
Really wish we had text chat for this very reason.  (at least on PC, which ... why would you play a fallout game on anything else?)
---
Capitalism is very good at reappropriating and selling watered down images of resistance to it's own benefit.
---
Remember that Pepsi ad?
---
Screws... mmmmmmmm
---
I kEeP dIeInG aT pUbLiC eVeNtS iTs NoT fAiR!!
---
You're a level 20 at an event meant for 50+, what do you expect?
---
My plan is to go to Wade Airport tonight and use all tbe budget on them.
---
Nay sire, it should be my duty to have this unfortunate task bestowed unto me! I shall take it as penance for all my micro transactions.
---
Don't feel too bad, it wasn't that useful. Considering other power armor is useful in sets, you aren't missing much.
---
I put it with my excavator armor but then lost all the perks since it was no longer a complete set.
---
Those harpoon effects are a major let down. Have you compared it to a standard harpoon by chance to see what damage and reload is like compared to a base weapon?
---
&gt;FED76 
---
its like KBB for cars, its not meant to be a price bible for used cars.  its just a guide based on what THEY think its worth.  if you dont agree, then dont follow it!  honestly these guides are often wrong but thats ok as free market will alway correct inaccurate prices in the end.  price is only as high as people are willing to pay for it.
---
Sorry Bucko the Dawn of Steel is upon you.
---
Yea the easy alternative is to equip a weak explosive weapon to tag enemies. Sadly not a lot of people cared to do that.
---
Thank you. I gave it 15 or so mins and its working now. Thank you
---
People would blow the limit in only a day or two, and then have to wait an entire week for it to reset.
---
It couldn‚Äôt be because it would require a 22 1/2 round mag size to get 90, so that‚Äôs why I think it‚Äôs a bug
---
No.  No one knows anything about when anything will return to the shop.
---
I did three launches and three Colossus events. It is very fun. The sound effects are creepy and the enemy hoards are a good time. Definitely a good event for XP. It drops 8 treasury notes fun weapons and a bunch of other stuff.
---
Down side for me are a few things. Firstly if you die and have any respawn glitch like me it's game over. No matter my weight or situation I always have the glitch. I need to stay alive. There's also this annoying rock falling sound that isn't that good. It's repetitive and doesn't sound like rocks falling. I know that's nit picking but it ejects me from the immersive feelings. If you plan on looting bodies do it while you kill them. I didn't expect to have to leave the mine super fast. I do like that part as it adds to the creep factor of playing it but it sucks if you want the stuff you fought for. Lastly, if you nuke it, hit the mine with the edge of the nuke so you can run out of the mine and into a clear not nuked area. 
---
Overall I love it and hope for more nuked like events. SBQ will be getting a break I assume.
---
You jest but we just did it in under 69 seconds ;-)
---
It wouldn't have to exclude current daily limits to reward regular players though, just make things more accessible to casuals. 
---
As an afterthought this would provide additional benefits - less overfull stash boxes  means less server load!
---
Hoping they keep their word and remove some restrictions, maybe add a way to rotate prefabs and foundations to aline with slopes or even I dunno large foundation thats flat and fills in the ground.
---
Or slight ground teraforming something!!
---
Why *wouldn't* someone want to do that?
---
Wow, vault raid at lv 31, that is the first reason.
---
Since you are specced for shotgun and in this situation, cannot respec for yet a few levels, we shall keep using shotgun.
---
Now, you need a better variant, a cheaty variant. 
---
Try to find a +limb damage secondary legendary effect, as these seem to give much more bonus damage in vats, and vats only. I would vendor hop, sometimes you can find these quite cheap.
---
Now you fight the sentry bot again, but with a better gun, and hopefully, a suit of matching PA which gives a bonus to DR.
---
Edit: if you are out of ammo and stim, you know what you gotta do. Farm more of everything! 
---
Personally, I would recommend waiting to lv 50+ when you have a build to finish final main quests.
---
Source please? I need to see these
---
Was hoping to try it again a week later but still not working. I was hoping to finish the main quest line before I moved on to my next game but with a main quest broken that's not happening. Maybe I'll be back with the next dlc in a year (assuming it's free too).
---
That's not a bug, it's how the event works. The cinders falling from the roof are basically instadeath.
---
I must come to you camp I must hear the symphony of the robots
---
Nothing was attached prior to the blueprint. I tried fixing it after the capsule part got destroyed and was able to move the computer terminal portion off first after repairing it, then I was able to pick up the capsule part and just set it down, leaving the base by itself. I then blueprinted all three parts.
---
So far I've only got the gross heads lol
---
Oh I'd never do this at my camp.
---
The sad thing is the whole game has potential to topple even cyberpunk if they would just put the effort in.
---
Since there are voice lines mentioning Hancock and Goodneighbour, is it possible that it's cut content from Fallout 4 instead?
---
Yeah I just ignore those vendors. They're hitting the chems a bit hard if you ask me.
---
I've also noticed that those vendors are often the ones with the most stock. I mean come on, your weapons *clearly* aren't selling buddy. Maybe you should consider lowering your prices a tad?
---
Beautiful, I'm gonna try every which away from Sunday to do this......***I HAVE IDEAS*** lol thanks for the details kind feller
---
Can you confirm what the fixed effects are for the cursed harpoon gun? I see conflicting reports below on whether it is furious or executioners.
---
Nice! I thought that wasn't part of the rewards, I want it!
---
And guess who made bank farming the crap out of that event and selling to impatient people unwilling to farm that event?
---
Next time you'll know how it works, looting the wendigos mid fight is the best strategy. If you cripple earls legs you can run rings around him farming them, once everyone has this event down it'll be really good for farming.
---
I guess you used the same math that allows you to level up at 750 5 times per hour.
---
Must be that "New Math".
---
I dont the armor ace board has anything to do with it, i mean we got a captain cosmos board but we didn't get an alien invasion.
---
I've had the same thing, I tried interior and exterior of walls, some with wallpaper and some without but in the end I found putting it over posters kinda works but still finicky just to get it to display
---
Is the vault raid at lvl 31 not a good idea? What level should I try again?
---
Use things that are anti-robot. Find some pulse grenades and toss those at it. If you're not wearing PA, wear some Troubleshooter's armor.
---
You could also join a public team and ask nicely if anyone is willingly to help
---
Jeff Bezos of the wasteland OMG I just laughed so hard at work like a damn fool thanks for that too funny.
---
Yeah bunkers are possible, I find the instruments to be tricky, i suggest using the personal terminal to do it instead, (personally) easier to set up, and power armor players can access it without exiting their armor
---
No problem, happy to help.
---
gonna get my refund now :(
---
At least you can milk a brahmin. Does that qualify as cuddling?
---
Fallout first got shafted with leftover items that were at best score based items, now this? One step forward and they flipping fell down the stairs.
---
just let your voice be heard, they have made many changes for us from the pts go on the fallout 76 pts forums and let them know what you think constructive criticism. They held back events and changed the system for legendary perks and just reverted the build bug that people got mad about, plus I think it is just so less stress on the servers multiplicative I think is a lot on the server and makes rubber banding health just let em know what you think seems like they listen.
---
I want to say it was a Juicehead video from less than a week ago. Looks like BOS rewards for the daily ops missions.
---
Supposedly, they do:
---
All those sub stations around the map have a power box that usually can only supply 10 power to CAMPS connected(?) to it, but if they corresponding power plant have been repaired, they provide 100 power instead while the power plant remains repaired (no idea how long is that, but most comments on the matter say they stay active for a few hours).
---
I would toast to this, but still waiting on the open bar.
---
Welp, I'm in
---
T-51 looks sick, but I like all them (except excavator and T-65)
---
I just tried the event again and realized I died at the very end to a rock fall just before the Colossus died.  Using a VATS build it's very difficult to avoid them since you can't heal in VATS and there is a delay in exiting VATS so you can quickly run out of it.  The boss died as I was respawning and thus didn't get credit for the event.  I spawned at the top section but as soon as the Wendigo died, it blocked the jump down with rubble so I wasn't able to jump down to try and loot anything.
---
Once again, the event wasted my time and resources.  Even better, from within the mine I tried to fast travel to my camp using the map but instead it ported me directly outside into the nuke zone.  This time at least I was expecting it and was able to put on a radiation suit in time.
---
Bethesda, PLEASE DON'T BLOCK THE TOP ENTRANCE AFTER THE BOSS DIES SO WE CAN AT LEAST GO DOWN AND LOOT STUFF EVEN IF WE MISSED OUT ON THE BOSS DESPITE BEING ALIVE FOR 99% OF THE FIGHT!
---
Enclave rifle and plasma rifle have different mod pools
---
I‚Äôm glad that worked, happy to help.   I‚Äôm on PS4 as well, happened to me a -lot- the first couple days I had the game.   Feel free to add me if you want someone to play with, psn is boredomshaman
---
Welp that‚Äôs 1000 atoms down the drain
---
Skyrim was not a laughing stock, neither was oblvion until recently when people started memeing hard on a dated game. Bethesda is just growing long in the tooth with their creation engine, and truth be told fallout 76 was a undercooked product.
---
Hypothetically i think bethesda could've just took the minecraft route of selling their game and did a long beta.Have wastelanders be "official release" and wiped all characters when the "Beta" was over and sold the game for cheap until official release.
---
This would have gone over WAY better with players to gain early access to a beta of the game helping shape and influences it's developement, and the ability to not be anchored to the past and be able to wipe characters and reblance for launch.
---
Instead they sold their game with a 150 collectors edition for a game that had it's world thrown together in little over a year and then pushed it out even though they knew the game play was experimental and fundamentally flawed and was going to need a lot of work which is why they promised free updates.
---
In other words if they marketed the game slightly differently and released the same product i don't think people would be ragging on them as hard as they are now.
---
Prices set expectations. It was only Bethesda's greed that made people dislike them. That being said Fallout 76 is a side project and i doubt most of bethesda is excited for fallout 76's future as they are with starfield or elder scrolls 6.
---
 This is probably the biggest obstacle to fallout 76, hopefully in the future when starfield is released they will go back and show fallout 76 more love and make it feel like a complete game.
---
Actually I'm not a heavy guns build so I'll probably just scrip it if no one buys it in the next days.
---
I was happier with the screws and gauntlet tbh
---
Can‚Äôt believe you actually paid that much attention
---
You can get it to show up if you place right where the wall and ceiling meet.  Not a good place for it though.
---
Def no where close to top tier. Having to reload kills your dps. I can run through WestTek with a fixer or .50cal more than twice as fast than I can with a i/33 harpoon. Fun but trash.
---
Get up in it's face and starting spinning around it. It can't use anything besides Melee if you're running around it fast enough.
---
I feel a little dead inside when I see stuff like channels that criticize/make fun of mobile ads doing an unironic and serious sponsorship of RSL. Gotta wonder how much money   Plarium is handing out for people to throw away all tact so easily.
---
Seems like a issue you need to take up with Bethesda not us
---
If you get to keep the early access items then you‚Äôre not really testing it for free?
---
As am I, fellow member
---
Maybe we should ask them to mess things up for a change....Do they work with reverse psychology and then immediately create a new engine and a whole working game?
---
Not really, you can tank them.
---
lol downvoted for answering someone, classy as always reddit.
---
I would do it just to make a statement
---
Pretty sure one of the Mutation Serums does as well.
---
Im always skeptical of every patch. So far every patch Bethesda has fucked something up.

Bethesda only employs people that wear aluminum hats.
---
I noticed this a little while ago. I thought it was really weird that there was more than one Grahm. They're both annoying, though. üòÅ
---
I just completed it 5 times but I'm still trying to get that helmet.
---
I had a mothman visit my camp.  It just stood there on my porch.  I kept staring at and poking it with my rifle.  Eventually it woke up startled and flew off.
---
Umm depends when you get enough ammo again etc. If you are str focused try to respec into heavy guns or melee as those will perform better than shotgun. 
---
The idea is you want to spec towards a build focused on one type of weapon (melee, heavy guns, auto rifles,/rifles etc) and legendary prefix (bloodied, junkies, anti armor etc). Once you do, you will notice much higher performance against enemies in game, and you will kinda know when you're ready:)
---
Hope this helps!
---
I just did A Colossal Problem event with my two friends for the first time and it was instantly melted by a tryhard abusing magic damage and bloodied before anyone even had a chance to tag. Completely ruins any challenge and I can't wait for these chumps to get their entire year+ worth of duping and tryharding balanced out in a single patch. The sooner shit like this is removed the better.
---
I dont think its so bad, it makes it so the event rewards weapons unique to it
---
How is it for unarmed builds
---
I get a blue screen saying my game is corrupt only with fo76 I am on console. Hope this is fixed by the time we get the update
---
If a team member is at the event you can fast travel to them to get back in.
---
Three of us killed it in under 30 seconds. Then again, another time it took 23 minutes.
---
Morgantown. Get the airport and the bit around the train yard
---
Shit I think even a stack of lunch boxes awarded would be fair. They still boost xp and all other shit and atleast the SCORE would be giving the players something. Maybe the 10k exp repeatable awards three or so? I dunno. 
---
These boosts are shared with others too and there's no negatives or losses by Beth.
---
Heck, if people have grinded furiously through there must be something at the end to keep people entertained before the next season. I'm all for this game, and to have nothing to keep earning seems very odd.
---
One freeze in game- had to alt tab to exit, one sudden exit for me. Not a good evening on pc.
---
I once loaded into my camp. Every turret firing at him non stop and he's tearing down my house one wall at a time. Couldnt kill him. Had to hop servers before he made me homeless. Lol
---
A chud is a chud, regardless of the forum. I call it like I see it and the "it was just a joke" excuse doesn't cover the sound of a dogwhistle.
---
So much about 76 is a giant bummer. I‚Äôd like a string of successes please.
---
Place your nuke south of the water park, east of hemlock holes maintenance
---
If your on a team just fast travel to one of them takes you back in
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter
---
Do I have to place it on a rug and move it like the conduit glitch? I tried for about an hour and couldn't get it in my alt. Blueprinted, rug, bass,banjo etc. Didn't try the terminal tho.
---
üòÅüòÅ
---
Could you imagine a bunker limited only by your collected resources for building.... But I doubt it. Would probably be a predefined build zone, similar to vault 88 I think it was in Fallout 4... door in, big cave, build within zoned area as much as you like or something to that effect. Guess we'll see...
---
This is my daily driver gun.  I break out the gatling laser or flamer for the big events only. I dont want to spend my life farming ammo instead of having fun.  The quad harpoon gun facilitates this play style nicely.
---
It doesn't use regular plasma mods/plans. The only learnable plan is the Prime Capacitor, everything else needs to be a Mod Box. They drop randomly from the event Dropped Connection, and some are randomly available in Watoga vendors (not sure if this includes Phoenix). 
---
If you search for the FO76 Plan and Mod Database you'll find a really excellent fan made Google sheets document.
---
Just a shout-out to this new Contextual Ammo system.
---
It was REALLY nice actually getting refunded on the ammo that I used to complete the event so I only had to worry about weapon durability afterwards.
---
Had a large Aztec vibing pyramid setup with signs leading to a room with a cooking pot at the very top with more arrows pointing towards it. When you interact with the pot, you clip through the back wall of the room and fall 15 feet down onto a bunch of punji boards that insta-kill you. He had another door at the bottom he could personally access to collect junk from any unsuspecting player.
---
I was lured to his camp through his impressive looking vendor stats on the map.
---
Nice to see someone using it properly and realizing how great it looks.
---
just stop playing the game. Fallout 76 is an insult to the gaming medium
---
Or those people who sell Fasnacht berets for 900+
---
There's a chance he will spawn at any of the random spawn spots. There's a map of random spawn spots.
---
My guy, it is 100% not my choice when I die.
---
They don't care. Whoever is spending money at the atom shop and on 1st are the reason they don't need to care.
---
I thought it might be that, it‚Äôs almost impossible to tell when you‚Äôre in it and not only does it do way too much damage, but also sets you on fire for too much damage. Bunch of bullshit
---
I has to put a rug on a rug on a rug going a little more out with each one, the base of the terminal is a little too big for just a stair or 1 rug. But once you're underground I moved my terminal and put it on a stash box just slightly sticking through the ground so you can still access it, beware of that though, if you fuck up it'll be very annoying to get back down there
---
Its crazy accurate and only a little less powerful than a 50 cal machine gun, but it fires twice as fast. Down side is the ammo is way more expensive to make or convert than 50 cal-
---
im for 1 for 1 success (no death).  my friend in group died and couldnt get back in
---
Always wondered if it was worth equipping lol I'll give it a try!
---
I've only done the event once, didn't realize there was a chest :/
---
Where can I find it?
---
Omg, someone did share Aquagirl. Noticed it as the team loaded in, didn't even give it a thought! Thank you!
---
I was farming a bunch of enemies earlier so no one else could get exp
---
Nice, because I remember trading a duplicate Deathclaw Mask for a Safari Crocolossus Backpack plan. It was an experience I don't ever plan on repeating. And now  I come to Reddit to see the drop rates before I even try. LOL. Thanks for the good news.
---
1 point in concentrated fire perk. Hit the vats button toggle your right stick to the left,  it should select fusion cores as the target but like a 0% chance to hit. Pop  out of vats, and than re enter. As soon as you renter, fire your gun as many times as you can immediately after hitting the vats button.  You need to pretty much fire as you enter vats. Vats remembers the last body part you targeted so it should stay on the fusion cores.
---
When entering vats theres a split second where you have a 95% chance to hit before it drops to the normal chance to hit. Sentry bots take absurd damage to their cores and you will most likely kill it immediately. 
---
Its kind of a bug you can take advantage of,but its been around forever.
---
But honestly lvl 31 is very low for that quest and youd be better off getting help on a team
---
Doesnt remove facial hair, but it still has that problem of removing hairstyles, so glasses/mask are really helpful
---
Unique but garbage. Whats the point of having uniques that wont ever be used. Its like the 2 you get from the Wastelanders, slug buster and VATS unknown, and the 1 from Becketts quest line. Becketts is atleast usable but the other 2 are just awful.
---
Just remove the limits, considering the insane rng involved to get what one might want, you could spend all day/week and still not get what you want.
---
Fuck it let me craft them
---
for some reason people think that explosive weapons are the best weapons in the game and a hunters explosive assault rifle is worth 8k just because of the secondary affect
---
Oh yeah, I know, been building for over a year now, I just choose not to use it and was shocked how much more budget the "fixed" ones now cost :)
---
Tbh it seem the only thing in the bundle that works properly is the stash safe. I have mix feelings about buying the bundle but the bunker looks  real nice in my camp
---
The vendors sell fusion cells at 6 caps lol
---
It's all about knowing where to go when it comes to legendaries. Certain events spawn legendaries like AWOL Armaments and those listed by OP, but there are also certain places that spawn enough enemies to have a good chance at legendaries. Here's my route if I want to farm up scrip or just try my luck with random drops:
---
1) I start at Charleston Capital, specifically the DMV building. I get between level 42 to 62 ghouls to spawn, mostly 62. Go to the terminal in the enter, activate one of the choices. Now ghouls start flooding in to the room. Kill them, clear the whole building, and swing back to the entrance as more ghouls should have spawned.
---
2) Go to the Whitesprings Golf Club if that's not busy and clear all the ghouls there. Then I go down to road towards the train station killing the rest of the ghouls in the houses and in the parking lot.
---
3) Go to West-Tek, clear the front, go in the front, and clear it out. You could get the 5 mutants that spawn behind West-Tek, but it's not really worth the additional time
---
4) National Isolated Radia Antenna, just north of West-Tek. Bunch of mutants in a small area, fast to take out.
---
5) The Burrows in Harper's Ferry. This is hands down the best to me. It takes some serious practice to not get lost, but you really can't beat the enemy density. 95% max level ghouls, 5% robots. You can skip the robots, though. It's almost always Gutsies and an Assaultron boss.
---
One loop of this might take you 2 hours the very first time if you're not familiar with the areas. After that, a bit over a half an hour? Then server hop and start from Charleston again. Boom! You'll be sick of seeing legendaries in no time!
---
I honestly just don't visit other people's camps for this exact reason.  Anything looks at all fishy I nope outta there.
---
A certain weapon not being the best speed farming weapon doesn‚Äôt automatically make it trash. I would say the trade off between spending a little time reloading far outweighs the need to maintain a steady supply of .45 or .50 ammo. You may not see the build as top tier but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it is one of the highest damage ranged weapons in the game when in the right hands. I would say there is a definite reason bethesda didn‚Äôt include a multi shot magazine for it like they did with the broadsider. 
---
I currently run a unarmed melee with a BSS dcg, a commando with B2525 fixer and handmade, and heavy gunner with the harpoon gun and a few Gatling/miniguns. I certainly prefer the heavy gunner over the other two in just about every situation outside of boss fights. Speed demon w/ strange in numbers on top of locked and loaded makes the reload unnoticeable while switching targets in VATS most times, and mine isn‚Äôt even faster reload.
---
Likely a Navmesh issue.  The Navmesh is higher then the mesh for the model.

You didn't have jerks come and insta-kill when your looking at your Pip-Boy in order to claim your held workshops.  When half the other workshops are open..  Seems I've been running into these guys (and gals) just trying to PvP and pick fights recently. They must be getting bored.  I don't want to PvP, but plenty happy to team up and share.
---
So can someone explain the lack of containers at ATLAS rn?
---
Thank you for the info.  There needs to be a 24h buyer's remorse grace period on this stuff because, personally, it's been like 50/50 for me on whether I end up happy with stuff and a lot of that has to do with the descriptions or screen shots being vague or straight up misleading.
---
Which you then run thru the ammo converter for about 3 minutes of flamer ammo.
---
People wouldn't do this shit if they reduced the time spent farming ammo instead of shooting it.  I understand the temptation with my favorite flamer.
---
Too late. Already bought it üò≠

^^Smooth brain thoughts

Is the grocers backpack just a skin? Or does it add longevity to items with expirations?
---
these are for *spoilers*, this post is 2 months old dude, just click them and they go away.
---
You make more ammo per craft if you use the ultracite variant
---
Even if it‚Äôs borderline god tier it prob won‚Äôt sell. People only want specific weapons with specific rolls and don‚Äôt want anything else anymore. I had a bloodied ffr 10mm smg sit under my vendor for like 3 months and I was like fuck it and scripd it . If it was a lmg or 50cal or a handmade it would sell instantly.
---
6? Pffft. Wait until you have to back out 20-30 times like I have to every time. Took around 30 today.

I so would love both to return. With Free States, Responders. When I heard about the bunker I thought would be a Free States one not communist.

Wow, big if true. Upboating for visibility. Ty for this enlightenment, of which I can only assume came from the Mothman himself. I will pass this on to Todd Howard's personal gmail, which I happen to have, as he is my uncle.

Goddamn furries.

Get off my lawn!!

same here. brand new xbox one x, too.
---
Screw that let us build them at our camps.
---
Wait. You did this on Xbox?  HOW?!  You have to manually enter the name of the toon in order to delete it.  It's not something that you blindly do.
---
Did I do that, and

It lengthens the time the food stays edible as well.. I believe. Are you talking about the atom shop skin or the mod you buy with badges?

I just want a square building area... the circles extremely annoying if you‚Äôre trying to build a fenced in area

And to be clear not the disgusting, pathetic commies fence I mean a REAL wasteland fence, one that looks worn down, built with scavenged materials, falling apart

Moo mother fucker. lmao

Lmao job complete
---
I have played since beta and this is the most fun event for me so far. I was lucky and did not experience any issues - sorry to the people that got buggy play - I know that sux.
---
I also like how they tied an NPC interaction to an event and look forward to more of that kind of content. NPC driven quests with dialog trees !

The thing is that one ad can be worth 3 months of views on YouTube. It puts good on the table

How does one accidentally do that?
---
I thought we were the QA team?
---
I think you need to go play Skyrim with *that* mod and leave the rest of us out of your fantasies maybe?
---
Wear a face mask
---
Indeed I did. Half asleep I typed the wrong character name thinking it was for some reason the character that needed deleted. Hence why I'm ticked at myself for not realizing what the hell I was typing.
---
Near the end its a side room when your escaping
---
 I did it well above 50 and it's level 1.
---
It would just cost a ton of repair resources he could get back from glitches anyways
---
May Todd be with you.
---
Is there a glitch with that? If I do that and no one else shows up to help, I get one wave of enemies at the beginning and then none for the next 7 minutes
---
By being a sleep deprived idiot and not realizing the name I typed in the delete box. I mixed the names up of two characters I frequently used and poof, lol.
---
it can go on foundations too -\_-
---
I had the good fortune to find one at an abandoned workshop and got to mess with it. 
---
I took one look at the shallow foundation, the grass poking thru, and the door animation which uses the garage door sound which runs twice as long as the animation and noped out right there. 
---
Never saw the floating inside, but I'm not surprised. 
---
I remember games of the 90s having enough sense to have door1start.wav door1run.wav and door1stop.wav for shit like that. 
---
Smh
---
Amen.
---
I was able to get back in by fast traveling to a teammate in the event.
---
Milk me senpai OwO. Ok I cant even say that seriously lmao
---
Did the event today 4 times, and had NO bugs to speak of, I just planted my survival tent right outside the mine so I could teleport to it and run right in, I'm a heavy gunner explosive and had my gauss minigun break at least once, this enemy is no joke, come prepared.
---
I had a melee guy in one of my teams, poor dude didn't know what he got himself into.
---
I used up upwards of 3000 2mm cartridges each run, got the deep mining helmet, wendigo plushie, shovel, and pickaxe. Good times!
---
So you guys are saying that if we had a weekly limit of say 100 treasury notes, and once you hit the limit reverting to 20 treasury notes per day until the weekly limit resets would cause people to complain?
---
It's worth a shot to see if Bethesda can give it back. Put in a ticket.
---
Don't forget the pipe pistol... actually it's pretty forgettable.
---
Lol. . . That's why I always name my disposable/new toon "y".  It saves time while speed running the start of the game. And, once I finish accepting the first mission from the Wayward, I delete it.  It's unlike any other name, because it's not a name.  You'll know for next time, huh?
---
*Sprays milk at you menacingly*
---
Ah yes I did forget it hahaha. I haven‚Äôt used one since I was level 5 and even then o stopped when I got a pipe revolver.
---
I wasnt looking for advice, but I get what youre saying :)
---
It‚Äôs gonna be a long Meat week isn‚Äôt it üòÇ
---
If you are on Ps4 and you happen to see my camp. Stop on by. You'll be happy with what you see. Lots of free ammo, food, chems, and whatever. Good prices normally just a couple caps higher than what my character will make at the Vendors.

It is a little strange that they left KL-E-0's lines in there. However, there are at least two unused quests involving Assaultrons in 76 and I think a lot of lines would be used for them. One is called ["First Date"](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/000187DD). You meet an Assaultron named Jesse and do some date activites. The second is called ["Extreme Measures"](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0000C06A), and it involves "helping" some robots do testing in the RobCo building.
---
Yep it's be better than this one
---
That was my formal flannel!!!

*pulls combat knife, power chugs another PBR*
---
Looks like I just found my next entertainment. Thanx
---
I did that, but as I said, it didn't find the files and reinstalled completely. I only have one game driver.
---
And; my game didn't crash. I was playing in the morning before work, and it wasn't available when I got home.
---
You have no idea. I have already started the Moo Gang uprising. FOR TO LONG WE HAVENT BEEN MILKED AND HAVE BEEN IGNORED IN THE WASTELAND! Rise my milk machine brotheren, RISE!!! (Side note we are only 4 cows strong)
---
Perhaps. From everything I've read once it is deleted they are unable to recover.
---
This is all I wanted during Fastnacht... too many people one shotting the sloth at the end. Could only do angry face emote but the middle finger emote is what I wanted...
---
My husband likes to share Last Laugh in teams, try that for some fun.
---
Especially if you equip some other explosive perks - damage, larger area etc.
---
Waititng the legendary perk "Ammo factory" + ultracite variant, i won't craft ammo until this perk come and i am already stocking on material to do so.
---
I use a decent gat laser with power user in the meantime, doing more than enough damage.

I feel like this is legit gonna happen to me at meat week when I start dropping milk everywhere

No, no!

Pay to respawn. Higher level and playing low health should add respawn penalties.

At that point why not just have it at 240 as a total or keep it as is

Hey! Pipe weapons rule man. I have a Bloodied/Vats Crit auto pistol and it's great. Pipe is Life!
---
Also not to mention most plans are 90% the value. 
---
Weapons are consistently priced. Never over 5,000 caps for even the rarest items.
---
There is also free scrap, water, and sometimes even mysteries. ;)
---
Eh. Personally, I think it's hilarious and I fully support that decision.

Man I dropped the nuke then crashed a quarter through the fight and was stuck in a loading screen until the boss died. Now I‚Äôm just surfing through public teams tryna piggy back off someone else‚Äôs nuke because fsr my nuke didn‚Äôt count the first time

X-01 with nukashine paint.

That‚Äôs great to hear! Yeah I‚Äôm used to people bitching about bugs when something new releases. I recently switched to a bloodied heavy build so that‚Äôll make things even more enjoyable!

I‚Äôm on PlayStation, I tried going to the PlayStation store to cancel but it‚Äôs not saying I have the subscription either

Not to be a mooch but if it won‚Äôt charge me I don‚Äôt need to cancel I guess, free stuff but I just don‚Äôt want to be billed

I am pretty sure it was Garfield who stole your pie.... check around for cats...
---
That is exactly what I'm doing. This was one of my original characters from the beginning stages of the game. I have another day 1 character that is very glitched mission wise that I quit playing with about a year ago. It is a lvl 58 that has zero items on it since I scrapped/junked everything it had to the character I deleted.

Be getting a what?

Lol

It would be pretty damn OP if your born survivor healed the whole team. Especially with max field surgeon and first aid.
---
I fucking  love it. I would add white tape or some sort of damage to your glasses. Great job. Keep at it!
---
The hardest nerf will be against low fire rate as those weapons rely on the ability to one shot or heavily damage/ cripple. From what I‚Äôve seen on the PTS my TSE sniper build is fucked it‚Äôll be dropping in damage to thr point where it isn‚Äôt really useful anymore due to the cost of .308 compared to the reward of using it. My bloodied build with the same rifle (bloodied this time) is still better, they didn‚Äôt make more builds competitive they made all of them worse and some even more useless.
---
You don‚Äôt go to the store in psn. Go to settings and go to account information it should be in there somewhere that shows your subscriptions.
---
I also checked that, it‚Äôs not there
---
Save your bullion for the gauss minigun.

I have found out junkies make a decent fragging build I might put together a commando perk load out for daily ops.

I think you need to whoa, whoa, whoa your boat there, hoss.

PSA: there are a number of glaring issues with fallout 76.
---
Ah I‚Äôm the same build but bloodied. My BE .50 does an ungodly amount of damage (kills West-Tek Super Mutants in a second or two) but this‚Äôll be a good challenge. Hopefully the surrounding Wendigos will drop enough ammo to keep me sustained lol
---
Just combine scrip and gold. Why have two different currencies?

Get rid of scrip, and raise the daily limit to 1000 gold PER ACCOUNT.

---
Honestly it‚Äôs not that much effort to travel to teammates if you use their name in the menu. I wouldn‚Äôt want teammates randomly trying to fast travel me to locations either or having to constantly select no to being fast travelled either.
---
Bethesda is too cheap to patch consoles as often as they need them.
---
No not really as a decent build with ok legendary can hit about 150-200 per shot half (just an example of magnitude) of that is 75-100 meanwhile an optimized Build can expect anywhere from 10k to 2k half of that is 5k-500 still way more than enough to one shot. So in reality they nerfed casual builds more than optimized. The demonstration above simply shows that an optimized build has a lot lose and can still be good meanwhile an unoptomozed can be severely fucked by the same reduction. In reality the nerf is going to be more like 15-25 (just a guess) so less of a hit but he casual will feel it more.
---
I got two in a row, but as a quest reward, not chest loot
---
Small world.
---
O ya. I get them both mixed sometimes.
---
I should have OwO'ified it to get the top post
---
My build is junkie, I used to be bloodied but I've been hearing reports that Bethesda is nerffing bloodied builds on patch 22. BTW keep moving when you fight Earl, also, he's got a "tell", right before he attacks with the scare screech, he crouches, keep a close eye!
---
That's been back on Xbox since wastelanders dropped.
---
ONE OF US, ONE OF US!
---
It's fun, and requires you to be strategic. I'll regret the day I get locked into the mine by myself, but until then, I learn a little more each time and pick up lots of screws.

Wait do smgs seriously count as pistols fffff

I am mid respec lol

Its something I just store my 100 gallons of milk in

Silva homestead. No server hop required.
---
I'm not sure why you'd say that. The story was really good, in my opinion. It just could've been way better with human NPCs. I just couldn't emotionally invest in it.
---
Hold off for the gauss shotgun. My friend and I both have bloodied gauss pistols and I can‚Äôt remember when either of us used them.
---
They‚Äôre nerfing literally every weapon and build that boosts damage. Bloodied will still reign supreme. It sucks that Mutant‚Äôs and Berserker‚Äôs aren‚Äôt getting much-needed buffs and are being nerfed instead.

The one in the atom shop bundle. I think it‚Äôs called Butchers Bundle....

This is not ironic.  It's merely the two sides that fought the war in this universe.

Pretty useless in VATS but if you shoot manually it‚Äôs pretty good.

I believe that‚Äôs just the skin man.

hey with covid and not going out its not like I have anything else better to do then find these people and spend rest of my day following them 
---
we also did a nature documentary where we followed around dupers narrating what they were doing till they quit the server lols
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇAre you looking to offload any of that? LOL
---
Changing it to 240 would work, keeping it as is pushes players away once they reach the bullion "end game" as the rest of the content isn't time gated so casual players aren't penalised for only playing once or twice a week.
---
My suggestion of 100 per week plus the usual daily totals was aimed at being a time gate compromise.
---
I know more players that stopped playing completely once they reached this point due to daily limits than I know that still continue the grind.
---
The scrip limit as is feels pretty ridiculous.
---
Nope, and neither does glow sight!
---
Yes but if I hit a supermutant in the eye with a two shot explosive .308 hunting rifle they should die. Now a 5.56 or .45 at that range should require 3-5 shots but no let‚Äôs fuck our high health stealth snipers. The

---
This, but just bring an automatic fire weapon with a decent sized mag, your hit chance will increase with every shot until you hit the cores.
---
Oh I guess there is a reason to do that one then.
---
That CANNOT be good for the server
---
Switch to prime and trade for materials.
---
I really enjoy fallout lore so I read most of the terminals I see anyway. I feel like the story at least got the primary points across without reading too much.
---
Anything besides all this Communist crap...
---
So just spam SB meat the whole time?
---
In order from left to right for me - hardly used, Nice scenery, unique camp setup (hills or camp under bridge), water, not nuked often, some resource spot.
---
Yup
---
God I *felt* that.
---
This, please.
---
they could just unlock every atom shop item in the PTS so we can give feed back on it - not only would it let us fix issues it would actually let us show off the cool stuff so more people buy the good items (hinty hint hint)
---
I gave up on mathing it out a while back. If it's a bad roll, I sell it for the MSRP.
---
The main one for me was overseer saying how all the factions could have won against the scorched if they worked together. For some reason that one really stood out to me
---
How do you play tank? Can I see your build?
---
Are you looking to milk me? O///O
---
ahh yes the mighty land whale the most deadly and secretive enemy of.... actually this was meant to be a joke but now I kind of want some kind of giant underground tunneling monster now.....
---
Wooden blocks contain lead, as long as you get a hit or two on enemies you get the xp if someone else kills it, growing tatos corn and mutfruit will solve your adhesive problems
---
You should go drunk Grunt even IF it happens and isn't just a soulless cash grab with "better" textures...
---
Though to be fair, it'll be clobberin' time in my book if it's not real.
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue I‚Äôve tried to let others do damages but they end up making the event so much harder than if I just kill every thing as fast as I can and I‚Äôm on a bloodied build so I can‚Äôt exactly stand their and tank damage. 
---
Had the issues the other day where no one seems to notice the machine is broken so I have to run in and repair to stop the event failing and thanks to the spawn bug I get slaughtered.
---
two things many new players are often unaware of at first..
---
you dont have to pick a perk card from the same stat you place the point in
---
you cant bank levels waiting for a card to unlock
---
ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ too much. It depends... how long is the line?
---
Is it a bad thing I cant tell if this is a joke or not.
---
It's once Earl dies, you miss out on his loot if you die before collecting, no options to get back in.
---
lol.. most childrens toys contain lead or nuclear material
---
Actually for that event I think killing the sheepsquatch quickly is actually the best option it‚Äôs only a 1 star and the missions rewards for keeping all 3 cows alive is what‚Äôs important anyway.
---
I just want one special day to turn it all in as a reward. Like during our double score weekend just let us turn in all the notes we have.
---
I mean, its probably true. You kinda prove that yourself through the story by using the culmination of their efforts. Granted, they didnt know MODUS or the Enclave existed, so thats the only thing that makes me doubt it.
---
Looking for the plans so I can put them on strangler heart power armour
---
Ghoul Slayers has never worked against Wendigos ever.
---
I mean my milkshakes bring all the bois to the yard
---
Wendigos are not ghouls.
---
Sure, they're not hostile to each other (as can be observed in the Whitespring golf clubhouse), but they're not the same enemy archetype. So no, it doesn't work.
---
Getting scrap is so ridiculously easy so the caps alone for the turn in is worth it which yes you could get more caps for selling the scrap directly but you can only sell up to 1500 caps worth per day so this is an easy way to get more money on top.  Besides what else are we going to use the thousands apon thousands of materials we've hoarded?  Honestly it's not a bad idea.  The rewards should be a little better but that's just being not picky.  Honestly I wish there was a place in the game at all times where we could sell/exchange/donate our scrap materials.
---
It doesn't. Even though you have multiples on the chassis, when you hop in you only equip the proper amount power armor pieces to your character.
---
Saw someone today... 5k caps per serum lol
---
i tried but after the loading screen it was only 10 sec left before the mine collapsed so I couldn't loot xd
---
And they‚Äôre like, it‚Äôs better than yours
---
Oh my god.
---
You sure you're not over encumbered? (check your carry weight). You can't sprint when you are. When you walk while over encumbered you'll deplete your AP, when that's gone you'll walk super slow until you gain your AP back.
---
I feel like this is such a strange question, like asking people what your own favorite color is. Its all personal preference.
---
Thank you. I was planning on buying it tonight. Dodged a bullet.
---
Are you over encumbered? If you're carrying too much weight, tht character will move like you describe. The AP drains really quickly then replenishes for a sec, allowing you to walk normally for a second, then it runs out again and you're in slo-mo
---
Not that long.
---
Rule 34.
---
Agreed, noticed that too when I tested it on the pts with my stealth-heavy-flamer. Bloodied sneak builds ftw.
---
There's a place in Appalachia thats pretty nice.
---
They literally knew something might very likely go wrong with the full release... that's why they delayed it for console so they could make 100% sure they could actually get it running on the pc live build first.
---
What is this referring to? Is the Wendigo Colossus event out already? I thought it was delayed.
---
yeah i die a lot bc i tried like 6 weapons and PA and unyielding xd (junkies gatling plasma&gt; bloodied gatling laser)
---
2nd run I died just once and we were 3 people but still, it can happen to others
---
Listen this isnt sexual its just purely business
---
Assuming all people on team want to fast travel then sure. 
---
But I‚Äôd hate to be doing my own thing, or fighting an enemy and then traveling to a different location because one of my teammates wanted us all to be there. 
---
So if there‚Äôs a confirmation saying ‚Äúwould you like to travel with team?‚Äù
---
So I can accept it or just ignore it.
---
I don't make the rules!
---
It‚Äôs a free update.
---
Chest isn‚Äôt required, it drops without. Straight to your inventory.
---
Yeah same xbox here
---
Been prepping for today for a couple days now. Farming for bufftats, sb brains, etc.. Had a crash to desktop halfway through colossus fight. Couldn't get back in.
---
Halfway through my second launch prep, there was a securitron under the floor, slowly killing off all the officers. Could not engage this enemy at all.
---
Very frustrating day
---
i got rewarded a cursed executioner harpoon from the event, i used it like an hour and the shit never broke with flechettes mod so it pretty legit
---
Weird I did my first today and I died right before Earl did and when the event ended I got a legendary, and a cursed harpoon gun. I spawned I  the prep area so I couldn‚Äôt go back to
---
hmm.. you and i both?
---
It's my opinion that it's trash. One man's trash is another man's treasure. 
---
It's pretty much completely useless to me when there's weapons that do the same thing but better.
---
Yeah, that's what I had to do too, sorry it's not possible for me to modify the SH pieces for you. Took me aaaaages to get.
---
If you let it kill you 76 times, it will self implode on the 77th load in.
---
So, what, it's better if they just hadn't tested it at all and it came possibly even more broken?  
---
Come on, let's at least be reasonable with our complaints.   
---
Any testing, even if it comes out with problems, is better than zero testing, and the event turns our characters inside out and flings them off the map or something ridiculous.
---
Earle's body fell through the map on my first success, nothing but a giant blood stain :/
---
I barely made it out before the collapse.
---
Yeah I checked that :( I even removed everything from my inventory just in case there was something causing issues but that wasn‚Äôt the case I also thought it might be connection issues so I tried resetting my router but there was no change
---
Assuming you want somebody to modify it for you, then almost anybody can. 
---
However if you want the Ultracite plan for yourself, it‚Äôs worth a large amount of caps. Some people are even selling it for real money. 
---
I recently got 2 Ultracite calibrated shock plans. Learned one of them, and the other is just sitting in in my stash box collecting dust. Simply because nobody has anything worth trading for me. And caps are meaningless, always at max caps.
---
Is it? It lags much less and loading times are as fast as on a private one. None of that works this way on live public servers.
---
No, sadly its not weight it‚Äôs still happening with 0 items in inventory
---
Does anyone have a screenshot of what it looks like?
---
yeah i got the reward from the event i just couldn't loot the colossus or the hundred wendigos that we killed either xd
---
I‚Äôd agree with this, I‚Äôm on the road behind the water treatment plant and have never had the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs already there‚Äù message. Surrounded by forest and rarely gets attacked.
---
Shop around. I got game for 20 bucks
---
...Are you sure? Cuz having 0 items in your inventory seems very unlikely. When you look at your stats, what is your total carry weight and how much are you using?
---
Yea, which sucked but at least you don‚Äôt actually have to lot early to get the unique items.
---
Yes, they've addressed it
---
Ah yes that one spot. It‚Äôs pretty good spot for a camp. You know your way around.
---
But when they implement it?

Weekly limit on gold and script sounds like a good idea, but honestly it doesn‚Äôt change anything at all. 
---
When I‚Äôm done playing for the day, I script all the legendary weapons and armor that I found along the way, and I usually end up having about 10-15 extra legendary stuff to hold onto. 
---
The weak legendary stuff I just sell to the vendor for easy caps. I usually just hang onto the 3 star stuff. 
---
I have 270 treasury notes on my character. 
---
I do a lot of events and stuff so hitting my daily goal is never an issue. 
---
If you increased the script and gold limit to 800 a week, It would absolutely mean nothing to me because I can hit they limit in one day. And then I‚Äôm stuck waiting another week just to be able to do that again. 
---
I personally think we should have a limitless amount of script/caps/gold. But that will never happen.
---
It's not the best place, but there's a good bit of it between Monongah and the mine. If you want to take advantage of all the nukes going off you can harvest the stuff all day.
---
It was nice while it lasted wasn't it?
---
Possibly they were given only "x" amount of time to fix it, and have likely taken to the attitude of "just enough that it doesn't crash the game, we can iterate on it later".
---
I emptied my inventory at camp to see if it was a weight issue and nothing changed. Every time I move in any given direction, that direction starts off with a slow walk and I have to hit it a couple more times before it walks faster
---
Yup 76 is easy mode, I'm praying that the re-balance coming up changes it so that it feels at least as difficult as normal difficulty does in previous Fallout games. The only thing that made 76 difficult at all was playing as a melee Berserker up until my stealth got powerful and level gave me a ton of hitpoints.
---
Big on t-51 but I love t-60
---
I dont see any power lines betwixt them
---
That is awesome.  Wait until you come across the Flatwoods Monster.
---
Still curious about your carry weight stats.
---
I Don‚Äôt even bother trying to sell anything not bloodied or unyielding.
---
Chill dude they already have it, it‚Äôs the people who purchase them. How do you think the game progress so far? Alpha testing by the players of course!
---
Why sir, you are such a hero, surely I may take your burden?
---
Don't forget that 2020 has literally impacted every gaming studio on the planet thanks to Covid; Bethesda included.
---
I almost never have this problem. Are you on a wireless connection? I do have my game crash entirely though, more than most other games.
---
I low ball my wares.
---
Also: all my ammo. (Save for fusion cores.) is priced at 1cap per bullet.
---
But still nobody buys it.
---
I had this issue after turning on GPU scheduling in windows. Haven't had it since turning it off. Maybe a coincidence, maybe not.
---
You cannot place blueprinted stacks, stop spreading false information. It is however still possible to stack them
---
My carry weight is 190 and my strength is 2
---
Was fixed today for PC, from what I gather. Maybe this Thursday for consoles?
---
You need a silo holo tape. Not sure how you got in there in the first place, it's should have locked you out to begin with.
---
Or to camps. I‚Äôm fairly certain they will one day, but the sooner the better
---
you found that ON him or you got it from the event? I got it as well but it was from the event completion.
---
Edit: I think I misread your comment lol yes I got that too
---
Hopefully the case thanks!
---
No is the simple answer
---
Dae wae
---
I agree. I have over 500 treasury notes at the moment and at one point I had 2 mule characters with full stash boxes of 3 star weapons...
---
The suggestion was intended more to make it more inviting to casual players to keep playing rather than them (majority in my experience) leaving because they'll "never have enough bullion for anything good anyway... "
---
It's alright
---
Exactly what I did. Equip Green Thumb and you have more flux than you can stabilize.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work, placing them still does with a trick
---
Right, see I‚Äôm relatively new but I thought when a site was in rebuild mode you couldn‚Äôt even get into it
---
You're not even remotely making a fair comparison.
---
Yes, a 50% hit to a low end build would have more impact than a 50% hit on the highest damage build, grant. Don't disagree there.
---
The problem is that's not how the damage nerf actually works in practice.
---
If say a bloodied stealth build has 5 different buff multiples that stack and the overall damage is 50% less than pre nerf, someone with only a single damage multiplier won't also see a 50% damage reduction.
---
In fact that one buff person would see zero change in damage output, barring other changes like One Wasteland.
---
Hence my point about the more casual/unoptimised players being least affected by the nerfs compared to how much damage is lost by the more optimised multiple buff builds.
---
All the damage nerf does is closes the gap between the upper end and lower end of the damage range. Lower end doesn't shift all that much while the upper end has a massive shift down in power.
---
Ah I see. My mistake.
---
Captainnoob has a couple videos up with one. It looks pretty functional and fun. If you're looking for a pistol imparticular, definitely go for it. 
---

Sir this will not do, I will volunteer and carry this burden for you.
---
Outta food and water? Starving?
---
Ultracite with T-51 chest and outcast paint
---
I go 150/250(maybe less).  I just decide to undersell most things as I would rather a sale as much as I can, than now and again. 
---
That counts for all items. I like helping noobs too.
---
I have seen some people that sell common plans for 65-100 caos each! Just no I sell all the plans I find for 5 caps no matter what rarities it is.
---
My first time running the event had someone instantly kill the Colossus in less than 10 seconds while flaunting about doing it over open mic... the damage balancing patch and fix to magic damage cannot come soon enough.
---
This sub:  "there's no challenging end game content"
---
Also this sub: "this event is too hard"
---
The best way for low levels to level up, is by taking part in high level challenges. This was true for farming runs at whitespring, true for scorched earth, and true for this. Unless the event is bugged, like scorched earth used to be, then there's no reason a couple of low levels would throw off the balance.
---
No worries mate, I've just noticed that when they get to that point many leave the game, it kinda becomes a grind from that point that could be a little bit more forgiving
---
For consoles it was PC got it first
---
Like most things, when will consoles be shown some love?
---
Oh yeah with the colossal problem. Maybe I'll wonder around there on some public servers when I'm finished nuking to get some extra.
---
Despite what it says, deep pocketed mod still not available for secret service.
---
Yeah I actually look forward to the all Appalachia or whatever it‚Äôs called. If enemies level up with us it‚Äôll be easier to level up as well. Fingers crossed.
---
Yeah I just ran into the flatwoods monster earlier today and it's been since launch if seen one and it immediately disappeared and spent 5 mintues searched around my camp lol
---
Love those encounters
---
Usually there is something always hinting towards that. Vault 79 was always there and hinted toward there being treasure, and the lead up to the update hinted at some grand conspiracy. Steel of Dawn, however, had hinted at no such things. Only that a recon group is headed towards Appalachia and have potentially abandoned the BoS‚Äôs ideology. Sure, we could potentially have a mission where we storm some Chinese base, but it won‚Äôt be anything major. All I‚Äôm saying is the I highly doubt it has anything to do with Chinese invasion and more so has to do with the Scorched and a new enemy being introduced.
---
How long will it be delayed
---
Windigo cave, also one stop. Brain fungus soup, yum yum
---
It‚Äôs Covid season he ain‚Äôt answering the door didn‚Äôt you get the memo
---
I don't think I've ever been able to place my camp after moving. I've read some things that said stacking items (like putting floor decor on shelves or tables, etc) or even having wall decor can cause the "item needs support" message and prevent placement. Building is one if my favorite aspects of this game, but it also manages to piss me off more than anything else.
---
That excuse is weak. 76 devs couldn't fuck themselves they are so dysfunctional. 
---
Covid or not they still would be horrible programmers.
---
Acid.... is the true rare resources when it comes to ammo crafting.
---
Dammit I bought it 10 mins before I saw this
---
Who is Pam?
---
I didn't know it gave legendaries would have to give it a go. Thought are they like uranium fever where they drop below level 45-50 legendaries?
---
People will always whine about something. The limit is fine because most people don‚Äôt grind legendaries till their stash is full.
---
In the treasure hunting quest from the wayward, you find her in a mine
---
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs Polly, who very much resembles PAM from Fallout 4.
---
With maybe a chance at vault steel? Alternatively have events give a chance at dropping legendary modules.
---
Yep!
---
na, not those. I seriously don't know what's going on. any idea how to report to bethesda?
---
Good to know
---
Steel dawn? Red dawn? Correlation with the word dawn is obvious, but keep overthinking it if its fun for you. Im saying canon has gone way off the rez so theyll just spitball it
---
Bunch of noobs you could be selling to, myself included.
---
Simple. We need screws. Screws are needed for a variety of things, and it just so happened that Bethesda decided to make them very rare for us to obtain.
---
its on a ssd. get covid and die.
---
[Here's some pics of mostly the inside. I took these when some dude nuked my base for no reason.](https://imgur.com/a/mOJVLIf)
---
WOLK, Frozen throne, whatever it was the first patch for 'Northrend' and the it does not change the result.
---
You know what, you're right, Pam is the rail road one, isn't she? I've been playing through 4 recently too so I got them confused
---
"Breaking news Bethesda recently sold 100% shares to tencent for $4.63 and plans to make  no more games"
---
Anti armor you say.
---
I think its because places like eBay and ezgamer
---
I wasn't even referring to a mod, i'm referring to the base game. They were like the Metal Shack half-circle walls. That aside could you link me the mod so I can see it? You peaked my interest.
---
Pretty sure it was on a private server
---
How are "magic" weps faring? 
---
I actually have an accelerated AA minigun with 50 limb, so might be time to switch the ArmsCo to 5mm.
---
That being said I have fond memories of an I E Pipe Revolver I was using from lvl 15 to  lvl 35.
---
I was lucky enough to get a god roll, and yea it's really good pushing over 400 damage but the issue with it is the DPS isn't high enough, so I found myself just drifting back to my trusty laser rifle, so now my bloody gas pistol has just been sitting in my stash waiting for the day that I've can sell them (if ever)
---
just how the commies like it
---
Final Word is another good suggestion
---
Yeah, that's not how the legendary effects work. But glad you found a weapon that worked for you!
---
Instead of breaking Bolstering like that guy said, you could break uny armor and still get the bonus to stats.
---
Damage was already nerfed 
---
it did not need any further nerfing. If you were not aware of the nerfs that have already taken place I guess you haven't logged in for a while.
---
Pumpkins at the pumpkin house count too
---
The event has been fine for me. The only problem I've had is the respawn bug. It seems like it's been around forever and it likes to pop up at the worst times.
---
I did the same thing with two combat shotties I have. First one I pulled out was level 40, used it for 5 colossal events.
---
And then I was looking through my stash and I found a max bloodied one in there, been using it since.
---
My favorite moment was when I was taking a break in the mire next to a bus scrolling through my pipboy and all of the sudden it got up and moved towards me. Scared the shit out of me! Ever since then the hermit crab has always been my favorite
---
Was that laser magic though or a straight AA?
---
I would be to If it's ever there for me.
---
It's random because I did on private server and it went there either.
---
I would bump that up. I don't use caps much except for fast travel so I sell cheap cheap. Scrip weapons shouldn't cost much imo. If I check fed76 and it's above like 2k I'll sell it for the low end of what it says. But if someone is only gonna buy it to get scrip I sell those things for 100 caps per star for weapons and 50 caps per star for armor. If you're hurting for caps though Facebook caps only groups are a good tool to sell stuff for more it seems, post what you have and say for caps and you in general will get alot more but it will take longer. My experience anyway.
---
The floating objects is terrible, huge waste of money and a let down.
---
that had already been done, and they over did it when they broke VATS
---
I think there's a Meat Week Set and the Atomic Shop Set
---
Noobs don‚Äôt have thousands of caps to waste on my bloodied shovels
---
Yup. And only 4 shotguns (pump, double, combat, gauss)
---
And melee weapons are really all the same. Only variation is Speed and damage, and there's very little variation there. Reach isn't even a thing, nor is AoE.
---
If I see any 3* weapon under 800 I'll buy it no matter what level or prefix just for the scrip. Not that I need more to add to my scrip backlog. I just can't help myself. I'm on Xbox too, if you let me know your GT I'd come check you out and probably spend some caps.
---
That sounds amazing! I haven't gotten much farther out of the forest other than to the Ashland so I'm very excited to see what else there is in this game!
---
Though I do wanna do a newbie store with early game stuff at super cheap prices just haven‚Äôt bothered
---
Yeah it goes alright
---
I don't see why they still need a cap they have many other ways to get people on daily, such as the Legendary Run, rep quests, as well as bullion.
---
Have you used one? It's basically a grenade you drop...
---
You need to talk to her first and then launch a nuke at the mine. 
---
It's not a big bug though, you'll just have to complete the event again
---
I knew it! 
---
Cat dirt...! 
---
#EVERYWHERE!!!!
---
Until now....
---
Someone's looking for a role play group...
---
I don't know why this is so confusing for people. It's exactly the same as with the Queen. 1 nuke, one event.
---
Using a Gauss Mini as a main weapon probably isn't the smartest idea. To each their own though, if you insist on doing so, Prime it and make the 2mm that way, you get much more per craft. If you want an alternative, I use the plasma caster for most non boss mobs as it hits very hard and is excellent on ammo consumption. I only ever break out the .50 cal, Gauss Mini, or the mini in general for bosses or tougher creatures.
---
Nah just goes against the commandment of God Howard ," though shall release buggy shit."
---
&gt;Why? I get it, they have to do with the whole war lore.
---
You answered your own question. Other factions are bound to have stuff added to them in the future as well...... so I dunno why anyone would stress over "what faction gets more content" right now when you haven't established anything serious of note
---
Commie disco. I dig it.
---
Honestly I loved the cryptids and the other worldliness that you feel at times in the cranberry bog and the mire regions. Its very unique to 76. Seeing a scorched beast for the first time at morgantown was also fucking awesome!
---
Yup. I totally missed the quest marker too. Just got teleported out like Load Berring.
---
How has it gone way off the rez?
---
We ran the event a few times on PC tonight.  No problems.  I had a blast!
---
I constantly sit on horrible legendaries waiting for the next time I can sell them. Even when I sell them I picked up 6 more in the same day.
---
I think I should test them for when they release on Xbox
---
My first success tonight was as time was winding down.  Earle was nothing more than a giant bloodstain as his body went who knows where.  I made it out of the mine with 1s to spare
---
I can't say I'm overly encouraged to do this event more given how much ammo I poured into it to get a shovel.
---
Some prick killed the boss in like 20 seconds so I'd say they're still as much of a problem as ever. People used a bunch of lunchboxes before it started and didn't get to kill hardly any of the adds.
---
I live near the border and most of us here consider Toronto to be our 'big city' versus anything on our side of the border.
---
The pandemic closures are hard, but truth is, I probably wouldn't be making unnecessary trips anyway. Most of us who live at or near the border are handling this pandemic properly.
---
Nonetheless, sorry about all the drama. Whatchagonnado, right?
---
I have been saving a place on my shelf ever since the plan was activated (you could see it in the build menu even tho the update hadn‚Äôt released) I‚Äôm excited for the update to come to Xbox but I hope they fix the bugs...
---
Also does the plan drop from the event itself or the boss? Want to make sure.
---
Yep want to know if it's flagged as atom shop in the inventory.
---
And not noobs, like myself, that look more for secondary and tertiary effects (poison resist and weight reduction)
---
From what I remember fusion and plasma cores are not part of thos system.
---
It seemed to be immune to cryo when I tried.
---
I‚Äôve found that just randomly exploring places can often times be the most rewarding. Goodluck in the wasteland
---
If you want cobalt Morgantown is the place to go, but this is good to know as well
---
Noble lads and lasses, you are far too kind. But it is I who must acquire this formidable task of the dregs.
---
Well my caps are still at max so its a waste, Where if I sell it for cheap in my shop I am at least helping out other players.
---
It worked before Update 21 with the "Camp Exploit Fixes." Something happened when they went to invert it for whatever reason. Wall Displays do it too.
---
It wasn't marked when I went through today. Hasn't been marked for a long time.
---
Lmao
---

---
Sorry - I just had to.....:P
---
What laptop were you using?
---
So the set that just dropped for purchase in the atom shop is not marked?
---
This is a serious question: Did you get on the PTS and test that yourself, or go off of what others have posted?
---
Did you do functional apples to apples comparison like I attempted with the watoga protectototrons (or some other critter that you can find that is reliably identical on live and PTS)? Or did you just look at the numbers on the weapons cards?
---
I've only been logging on to either live or PTS to compare various aspects of DPS, and intentionally avoiding new content with the hope that they get this sorted out before its live. That said, I don't see a lot of people on PTS at any given point in time. Maybe 8, max (including me).
---
Love this event , good direction
---
That's just cruel, that person should be ashamed
---
It died for a worthy cause.
---
The whole atom shop should be shut down indefinitely until these dumb ass devs get around to fixing all the broken items. Paying this amount of money for glitchy items is very disappointing
---
That‚Äôs polly not pam
---
Did it twice tonight successfully.  It was a blast, highly recommend.  Be warned you need to have your shit together.
---
Ugh its late disregard I haven't bought the atom shop since I didn't want it.
---
Oh this is ok but you're probably all the same shit kids that cry about the ammo factory...
---
Reddit is a stupid place...
---
I only carry 3 weapons with me, allotted ammo and the perks for weapons and ammo...either from actual perks or from armor.  Not hard....helps i have unyielding armor as well lolz
---
I do 10 caps per scrip
---
No worries. Tbh I am trying to figure out if all the sets from last year are going to be considered 'legacy' since it's now in the atom shop.
---
Played it twice now and died after Earle twice, but I don't think I missed out on anything. Did I? I was able to loot his corpse before I kicked the bucket.
---
Yeah, sorry, u/tshk80 caught that as well, added an edit!
---
Thanks, I was just curious. just read in other posts that other players weren't doing anything. Would hate to go through all that just to end up with a lazy team
---
I see where your coming from but I‚Äôve seen too many casual players in inning half assed buffs that will only harm them. Also even a slight nerf when you deal such little damage can be a life ender.
---
Sadly I'm looking for the plans so I can mod strangler heart armour. Have been farming the Queen like crazy...hundreds of jet packs and useless other plans. But never something I need
---
But...you would receive the same legendary coins either way.
---
Hey it drops from the event itsef (when you're out of the mine), at least all of the unique rewards have dropped from the event so far for me. The colossus gives a 3 star legendary though. Hope they don't delay it too much for you guys.
---
Not sure where the box is, the only sticker left on it says Dell G3 15, although I doubt that narrows it much
---
Yeah the struggle is real....
---
Dude, i can take the wendigos out hella easy...colossus isnt that bad as long as everyone is pulling their own weight.  When it says to bounce, bounce yo.  It adds a little drama to the game when you still have to deal with the little guys on your way out.
---
wtf even is the Scorched Detection system honestly
---
Lvl 755, have 36 unopened packs and 580 perk points...i will own all the legendary perk cards day 1
---
Let‚Äôs be honest, I‚Äôll be playing cyberpunk before it comes out on console. For real though thanks a lot. Hope you have a good day
---
Do we find Senator Blackwell?
---
I feel like the Savage Divide is the most popular general area for player camps. The views are pretty good, and the central map location means cheap fast travel to most places.
---
I've seen it on the revolver but not the 44.  That would be cool
---
You sound like you didn't read anything said.
---
I play on Xbox, but I can find the name of it; I believe it was a military props merge or something of the sort. It looks like I have the files installed but the mod itself is gone. It's a better version of a previous mod I had of a similar archetype. I miss this game so much.
---
Get it! Use that shotty until u unlock the guass shotty! Guass shotty just so OP atm even with the upcoming  changes its gonna own
---
I switched over to stealth gunslinger after I picked it up on a lark. Highly recommended. 
---
There are barely any mods, so it's easy. Hardened, suppressed, reflex.
---
Unfortunately, in my excitement I didn't think to take a picture of it happening, so you'll just have to take my word for it that I didn't loot it off the roof of West Tek. If you catch me in the Wasteland, I'll have my party hat on ü•≥
---
This is a instanced event with only end game lvl enemies limited to 8 people. Lvl 20s don't belong in there when its limited to 8 people an the lowest lvl enemies are lvl 60.
---
Shhh ü§´ü§´ what happens in milking club stays in milking club
---
This some kinky shit.
---
Yes I did
---
I tested on super mutants at west tek. On live vs PTS.
---
Same thing happens every time I move my camp and as a builder I like to move constantly. The only thing you can do is rebuild from scratch.
---
Well, to be fair, this doesn't generate any junk aside from a stray glass shard. 
---
Though to be even fairer the Ammo Factory one is pretty mild too in the grand scheme of things. Like some of the prewastelanders junk/aid dupes were insane.
---
It's Burger King. It's pretty good. Fun tip: It's also not Vegan or Vegetarian (I don't remember which), because it's cooked on the same grills that meat is cooked on and will absorb the meat grease.
---
I barely payed attention I thought we helped him to get access to the silos
---
...
---
Yup. That's the only way to qualify for the Shielded Raider Lining plan
---
I had already received the quest from her :(
---
I been wondering this my self wouldn't mind haveing extra things to do
---
But its fun running my life with a hoard of wendigos chasing after me. I just wish the timer was a little longer to get out of there.
---
Everything is free besides things from the atomic shop and any bundles.
---
Ah I now $ee my mi$take
---
Is that you, Evanc3!?! &gt;:(
---
Yea, look for the scoped revolver in blue boxes in NW, it's got that grip and it's weird that its unique to jt
---
They should be fixing/adding that aren't they.
---
Agreed. I like to think my items are modestly priced. If it‚Äôs valued at 100 sell it for 10. Valued at 350 sell it for 35. The shit I‚Äôve seen is insane to me.
---
I understand what you said, this is a hypothetical strawman.  All I'm saying is don't be that low level person going into too high of an area.  I'm not saying you are that person though.
---
Decent worked first time
---
Oh man, that seems low.. 400c for 3 star wpn. is so cheap.
---
I run a stealth commando build on all my characters, so it depends upon how strong the Follow Through perk ends up being in practice. If it's additive like all the others will become, then that's not too compelling. The only other one that catches my interest is the poison resist one, but the likelihood of me having all the same type of armor is low and the number of situations where I would need it is low. Other than those two, I see nothing compelling that would make me want to use anything but six SPECIALs.
---
Haha, you too!
---
I mean I'd love to die but multiple suicide attempts have failed throughout my life. Didn't try the gun yet though. Wanna help out? The state won't help me out with assisted suicide. 
---
 I load into any place in 10 seconds on ssd with Xbox one x.
---
This joke is too long to be enjoyable.
---
I killed a WC a month ago after wasting so much ammo just to get crap. It‚Äôs pointless. These raid level bosses need to drop like multiple legendaries and not have the same pool as a lvl 3 rat
---
You are never "forced" to move. If the server says it cant place and you dont want to find a new world, just dont move. Next time you get on, it will still be right where you left it. 
---
If it was more of a bad location and just needed to move, its still not forced.
---
Submit a ticket an say your moutain scout outfit is missing an broken. Only way its ever gonna get in game.
---
Did you loot the chest at the exit?
---
I thought before that the bonus challenge was going to be another double score weekend. Is there no double score weekend coming up so I should just complete my weeklies?
---
Ban them too man.  Ban them too. 
---
Now I go to camps and these guys have 20k 45mm for 5 caps.
---
It's also Whitespring, not Whitesprings, but who cares.
---
Here is a thought. Now hear me out here, we spend this money now... and make sure everything works right, not just "just works" but works right, and the sheeple will trust us to give them a good product for the future and spend their money on us!
---
I think its alot easier then the queen. I like it
---
Sure, but you miss out on the functionality of those cards until then.
---
A little off topic, but my three year old loves to ‚Äòplay‚Äô Fallout with my with a disconnected controller.  We both have fun but I worry about... I dunno, running around killing things with him.  Should I be?
---
I get scrip faster than people buy it. Cheap prices throws it out the door in a matter of minutes
---
I know a guy
---
Damn I never noticed lol
---
Cosmetic rewards are always worth it to me.
---
Chest at the end!?
---
Are your legs broken? Use a stmpak
---
I don't recommend you fully rank up a legendary perk. The points give more bang for the buck if you spread them around, getting all your slotted cards to rank 2, then all to rank 3, etc.
---
I went online this morning and the world I joined had already had three nuked dropped on that spot. I decided to collect flux. Stupid amounts of Yellowcake but I got enough (40+) of cobalt flux which was nice. I saw the Ultracite but decided against playing with scorched. I usually do that near fissure prime as there is so much. It's a good technique.
---
I'm sure the records would show who implements the actual exploit, but yeah, I would recommend just staying away or spending what seems like a tedious report process. Because of the reporting difficulty and Bethesda'weak or non existent response would bother. Plus I ain't a narc IRL so why waste my time in game üòâ
---
God I'm glad I claimed that one before wastelanders lol
---
Legit level 59 with 20k. Not buying a shovel but still looking for good guns.
---
When you first enter the mine there's a door on your left that's marked as inaccessible. After you kill Earl that door unlocks and there's a chest you can loot on your way out that has chances at some gear that's unique to the event
---
I was thinking this while reading this post and others. I'm sble to play daily and I know I will blow through the limit within a day or two then have to wait 5-6 days while collecting legendaries that will fill my inventory. A solution would be no cap at or at the very least raise it  to be around the cap limit.
---
No, you helped him regain access to the Kovac-Muldoon and when you did, he saw all the scorched and was like "Oh, now I see why you contacted us" and that lead into you gaining access to the silos.
---
Yeah but the artists need to know all of W Va is on a 30 degree slope in some direction. Level ground is a myth.
---
People may not grind but events give you a boatload of legendaries. I don't grind legendaries but my stash and character are always full of legendaries just from treasury note grinding.
---
it sucks
---
The event reward may be bad, but you can farm a ton of screws and ammo and that is enogh for me
---
I really don't know how you guys play this game and not even kind of pay attention to the story. You shoukd really make a new character and play through it again.
---
I still make the mistake of calling it goodsprings sometimes
---
Alright, managed to find it. It don't understand a lot of it, and, I'm probably giving more than I need to for you to understand what kind of laptop it is, but, oh well.

---
Thank you üôèüôèüôè
---
Your clones are very impressive, you must be very proud
---
&gt; I just wish the timer was a little longer to get out of there.
---
What happens if you're still inside when the timer runs out? Does it just kill you and respawn you outside? Because if that's the case, then (unless you've been looting screws) then there's no difference between escaping successfully or not, because there's no real penalty for dying.
---
I haven't played it yet, so correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I agree. The style is distinctive and appealing, which makes it really tempting to use, but really hard to match with the existing outfits.
---
A gaming laptop, did you see that your laptop can handle it?
---
You can buy the plan from the bunker if I am not mistaken.
---
Ah ok any idea when it will come to ps4 and thank u for the reply
---
It‚Äôs not a birthday pie
---
How exactly would it work if you didn't have to?
---
I've never had a blueprint work when I moved
---
And here I am, with a mountain of them on an alt cause I have a hoarding problem. Lol
---
Never heard of this before in 76. Is it maybe the controller? I'm assuming you restarted the console. Maybe sacrifice an old cell phone to the technology gods? Hope it gets resolved!
---
Make a second character just to make sure?
---
I heard they got rid of it.
---
Nay. All of you brave and selfless souls shouldn't take this burden, it is too much to bear. I shall take this weight from your backs and carry it myself.
---
You get six slots at 300 and can put any of the Legendary Perk cards in there. They don't need to be max rank to be better than what you had. If you are high level, you will likely be swimming in coins and will be able to level up most or all of those to rank 2 and maybe even a couple to rank 3. You don't need rank 4 on everything to be a good player. You certainly don't need ALL the legendary cards to be ranked up; just the ones you actually use.
---
I never even realized those plans weren't always in stock, they were for sale the first time I checked that vendor. Doing a quick google search it seems like I was just lucky. I'd mod your legs but I'm on PC. Hopefully the plan will show up soon.
---
I had to move because some random person I teamed up with left 3 glitched ammo factory‚Äôs at my CAMP and from what I‚Äôve heard the only way to get rid of them was to move so people wouldn‚Äôt think I was using the exploit.
---
raising daily limit beats purpose of timegating.
---
I dunno man, seems too tricky to me. Like making screws. Those little guys are wild!
---
I have only seen one once. Standing.on a cliff and just staring at me. As I started to move towards it, it vanished.
---
Grow your own...lol
---
Yep: His skeletal is slumped over his desk in his office (His bunker)
---
You don‚Äôt.
---
You do the umm default? ones like kill scorched with a rifle.  Eventually (like me) you run out of free atom possibilities so it‚Äôs either wait til next season or buy atoms.
---
I mean, I've been playing 76 since Wastelanders came out, and it hasn't given me troubles (beyond the usual 76 troubles) before now. 
---
It can run other things just fine, stuff like 4 (even crazy modded), 2016 doom, viscera cleanup on highest settings, pretty much anything I've played before now.
---
I did it twice with no problems.
---
yes ash piles are causing major lag since the last patch dont use teslas or gatlin lasers where there are lots of mobs
---
What light is that? Atom shop exclusive?
---
Wow I had no idea, thanks for tell us. What's the unique gear, just another chance at one of the 3 cursed weapons?
---
Except whatever junk you've looted right? Wouldn't you drop it all when you die at the end of the event?
---
On my last run tonight I got into position, crouched and to Earl's left, and started firing my Junkie's Explosive minigun and didn't let go. Unexpectedly, after about 10 seconds of firing he died. Sooo...10 seconds? If I get a chance to record it I will.
---
If you think a multi-million dollar company gives a rats ass about sniveling little assholes like you and OP, then you're a legend in your own mind. I feel sorry for the generation of delusional self-centered cunts that are being raised.
---
Did u drink nukashine?
---
Let‚Äôs you upgrade the various under armors
---
I don‚Äôt have crops in my camp, and if I did I sure as hell wouldn‚Äôt have 50 crops for me to grab.
---
Some under armour
---
ah ok, yeh there were a few players using Tesla's
---
I tested the two weapons that qualify as magic, and I didn't see the magic damage on PTS. I tested on Live with the character &amp; weapons after the PTS and it sure looked magical to me. 
---
Has Angry Turtle or one of those other FO76 Scientists tested it out?
---
Flux, prime barrel mods, decon arches, mutation serums, trade commodity.
---
And you can make mutation serums
---
I think the ones from meat week are blood splattered.  These in the atom shop look clean.  Not sure about the hats though.
---
I don't stack anything but I do electric conduit on my roof and I think that gives me the "item needs support"
---
The secret service jetpack also requires flux
---
Oh okay I forgot about that part, I always had a brotherhood suit for under armor but they changed it. Do you know what other good under armors are there and if there‚Äôs one that can increase strength?
---
uh huh
---
Had you been drinking recently?
---
There is, but it's double dailies.
---
Stay excited. The first, and second time, I had one drop for me I was super excited,  my wife still makes fun of me for it, but we all know how exciting it is. Just because someone else stole it, doesn't mean you didn't win it. If you want one to display, and you're on xb1, I can give you one.

I should probably just wait until meat week drops again and see what drops.
---
It‚Äôs at the production wing, not down past the laser grids.  Kinda near where the kitchen and the dining area are. Should be almost always in stock there.
---
I sometimes call it Whiterun.
---
You need it for power armor mods as well as what everyone else already said.
---
....my info might be out of date, apparently. I know that was where you got cursed gear or the deep miner helmet on the PTS but I'm hearing that's changed and now the chest is just standard end of dungeon chest loot
---
Siiiiick.  I need a ton of it to craft my UC .45 ammo.  I've got a ton of hardened/glowing mass taking up stash space right now.

I thought str was on most of them? I can‚Äôt remember honestly

I run skeet shooter three and concentrated fire one. Always aiming for the head, if I need to cripple something I know how to shoot at the legs.

Very true

No I mean the explosive bite and arrow. I don't know what you're talking about lol
---
So it‚Äôs double score for the dailies but doesn‚Äôt affect the weekly challenges at all?
---
The base of the bunker is super shallow and hover above the ground literally everywhere. It's so damn awkward. The turret slots on the outside aren't actually turret slots and don't even show up on the inside (though they'd be by your feet if they did). The inside is super damn small. The fencing has a massive gap at the bottom whenever it's placed on foundation etc so it's a half fence lol.
---
Play for 7600 hours and get the 760 free atoms.
---
In terms of cosmetic looks, definitely my nuka cola T51
---
I don‚Äôt know because I only ever used the BoS one, but I need to check the others. Thanks for reminding me!
---
I used broken unyielding for the boosted stats. Sneak is going to be your friend regardless of which weapon u use. I preferred running lower hp with berserk to deal more damage and be sneakier with the add agility. U can run full health but lose damage and and overall better stats but could run the survivor perk card combo
---
Plasma cartridges and plasma cores are two different ammo types. Ultracite cartrige was not on the list in the datamined post.

it's a bug.  Happens sometimes.

That sucks

Fence works fine for me. Gets plenty close to the ground and is very flexible with sinking/raising, unlike the concrete walls. The pillbox bunker isn‚Äôt horrible and it‚Äôs got a cool door. Basically a concrete igloo.

On the way out I said 'you're giving me a pie' and true enough it dropped.

I turned to Mumbles; 'This isn't over.'

Also instead of caps, the Ammo Machines at train stations should take AmmoPoints.

You can‚Äôt put the ivory grip on the .44 and then scope it? I know nothing about pistols. Just my thoughts

The GREENHOUSE.  
---
YES.  
---
FINALLY.  
---
I missed the geo dome when it was on the atom shop and need to scratch the green itch.
---
I sell utracite ammo for 2 caps. It's completely reasonable considering the effort it takes to make.
---
I believe so.
---
Earl ain‚Äôt going nowhere so if we all mess around for five minutes farming screws I‚Äôm okay with that, it‚Äôs not like we are gonna fail the event. Boss fights like this are a massive ammo sink, your looking at thousands of rounds for certain weapons, in which case I‚Äôd like to make sure I‚Äôm getting as much out of it as possible, instead of just killing the dude and being done.
---
Or share XP with everyone in the event. I know that'll give an incentive for AFKers, but other players might do more of the other things if they know they don't have to camp a hallway the entire time.
---
That's what you deserve. Death is the preferred alternative to communism.
---
Welcome to 76 our cookies have bugs
---
I tried that.  I made a bunch of good 10mm and baseball bats and was selling them for 1-5c and set up between 76 and the wayward but I had so many problems with my camp everytime I logged in
---
.
---
Thanks for clarifying. I appreciate it. The grind has been strong with this one
---
I'm the drum guy
---
The best part is if you stand in the wrong spot at the end of the event, you‚Äôre instantly killed and forced outside.
---
Found that out the hard way on the PTS.
---
DO NOT STAND INSIDE THE SHAFT YOU DROP DOWN.
---
As soon as Earl dies, that shaft has a rockfall and kills anything inside it.
---
Dumbest shit ever, but there you go. 
---
(I got feared into it and just stayed in it fighting Earl; seemed like a great spot because he couldn‚Äôt get inside! Then he died. And I died. FML)
---
I've only done it twice... but same thing happened both times.
---
Depends on build and backpack.
---
Hey, feel free to shoot me a pm if you want to
---
I'd love it if somehow Kent Connolly showed up in future content related to the Order of Mysteries. On one of the computers you can read fan mail that he sent to Shannon and with how obsessive that guy is when it comes to super heroes I could see him deciding to check up on her after the bombs dropped and he became a ghoul.
---
Same. I wanted it mostly for the fence too. I wish we‚Äôd get more in game build plans.
---
I was thinking stimpacks leveled gear and ammo oh and cranberries
---
Save five grand and have someone make them. Just supply the flux.
---
Lol.
---
The problem is, the cards arent very "Legrndary" when they're not at lvl 4. And even then, they're just, very good cards that dont take special.
---
But it is true that the cards are alright at lower levels, but if you're a player who does a lot of respecs, or simply has multiple builds to swap through, you're forced to scrap all but one build if you want the most you can get out of your level.
---
it may not have been so bad if it was in the game from the start, but as it is, its pushing everyone too hard into staying with one build. And to sacrifice any qol cards they done absolutely need to keep.
---
Simply making the coins more consistent would make a world of difference, such as getting a coin per level, and a coin per card scrap. That would keep somewhat similar amounts of coins without forcing players to scrap all they dont need for that last level of a card
---
There was actually some guy who made a post a couple hours ago, in a group with seven others I believe and he busted out some bloody magic weapon and didn‚Äôt realize he was going to melt Earle... he apologized. Chances are slim that y‚Äôall were in the same group but who knows
---
Yeah, seems pretty rare. Thanks.
---
After a 23 minute successful fight using magic weapons I joined another server and did the event again. This time I used a magic weapon I hadn't tried yet and the time to kill (first shot to last shot) was around 15 to 20 seconds. I was not expecting Earl's health to drop like that. BTW, it was a Junkie's Explosive minigun. Next time I'll use less OP weapons and will only bring out that weapon if the fight drags on and we seem to be struggling.
---
If you want to, shoot me a PM
---
Colossasaurus?
---
I love it
---
Nah it's a different pistol. The ivory grip is for the Single action 44, which can't have a scope. What i saw was the 44. pistol with a scope and a white grip
---
Well the best one for strength is the secret service underarmor with the shielded mod
---
Secret service under armor gives 4 strength and some other stats I cant remember but you have to put the shielded mod on it, each point in strength gives 5 units of carry weight so it would give 20 extra carry weight. 2nd best would be shielded urban under armor from the enclave.icant remember the special stats they give though
---
Ss is the best I believe. What system you on?
---
OK, right on. Thanks for not being a douche with your reply to a veteran player who is unknowledgeable with certain weapon types. Lol. Always like new information
---
True and they are unconventional mods that makes them feel like a shotgun. Imo anyways.
---
No prob, revolvers arent commonly used, I just wanted this white grip one for display, since it reminds me of a revolver from a story I like
---
Thank you, I usually instabuy stuff (silly, I know) but you literally saved me.
---
PS4, and by ss you mean the secret service?
---
So glad I am not alone
---
Only Bloody builds needed a nerf. Now forcing more players to be Bloody is wrong and offensive. TY for sharing your experience. I came to respond to Bloody players cursing the nerf as they shouldn't be but now I find myself cursing with the lot of you. Sigh.
---
Thank you! Any idea if that underarmor is tradeable or do you have to reach the ss to get it?
---
It‚Äôs probably because most collection items work on a single instance, the extra is just storage. Like with water.
---
I imagine when one fills up, the scrap generation goes to another one.
---
Thank you so much mate. Appreciate it. I watched a video on YouTube and it was sending elsewhere.
---
I got a seemingly endless loading page and then a crash to desktop. I'll try again tomorrow.
---
You know I think I know which scoped revolver you‚Äôre talking about in nuclear winter. I actually like that thing. Don‚Äôt remember it having a white handle as my hands were covering it but I remember picking up and using a scoped revolver more than once. Like one of the round scopes right? not a recon scope.... Round scope, LMAO whatever the terminology is
---
wendy's?
---
It doesn‚Äôt do anything
---
I think you do just restart outside but I‚Äôm not sure if you get rewarded unless you escape. In addition to screws wendigos during the fight now drop whatever ammo your using. This includes ultracite ammo as well.  
---
the problem is their really isn‚Äôt enough time to loot the wendigos during the fight and their isn‚Äôt enough time to loot them plus earl after the fight. Honestly like 30 extra seconds would be enough to give players some extra time to loot and escape.
---
Pts only for now
---
I got murdered by a swarm of Wendigos when Earl went down and nobody revived me.  I wasn‚Äôt able to loot the boss because I spawned outside but the event completed for me and I got a nice 3* AA Handmade along with the other drops like the Harpoon gun.
---
Sadly not tradeable
---
To that end is basically why I got out of the gun business.   To much work and a budget sucker.  Bulk Steel, bulk lead, bulk aluminum is what sells fast.  That and serums if priced right.
---
Yea the longscope, technically shortscope in the mods list. But basically it's just a white grip instead of the wood or rubber.
---
Ah ok ty.
---
It would be easier to simply make Crater and Foundation free fast travel locations than have them figure out a place to put a Gold Bullion Machine at each station.
---
Appreciate the info, be safe out there man
---
Add me. Andreslamantis. I'll do it for free, since I can't promise I know the mods you want.
---
Fixer plans are earned from Encrypted which is a hard end game boss fight. I do not know the drop chance though. But you need to conplete the Lowe-Down questline.
---
This. One shot 76 was boring and impossible to make meaningful content around.
---
Thanks for the info, I‚Äôll pick it up once I reach the ss
---
A common game design best practice is to have a currency cap at 10X(or more) the most expensive item and there should never be a spend/sell limit daily or weekly...etc.
---
There are actual game design currency books and Bethesda ignores it all. A thriving economic exchange keeps people playing and never feeling limited. The caps exist in games only to limit people from buying everything instantly in expansions or when updates appear and to prevent a global elite within auctionhouses/vendors etc. Of course Bethesda needs to fix the vendors I highly suggest linked vendors so people can competitively compete(auction house style) by undercutting etc until a proper Nash Equilibrium is reached. A central buy sell bid kiosk/bot could be set up in foundation and the crater. That lists the items/sellers/prices makes it searchable for certain items and allows sorting by price/alphabetical item and sellers.
---
So in other words the scrip cap should be 1k instead of 1500 and you can earn/spend as much of this as you want. 
---
Cap limits should be around 280k
---
Gold limits about 20k
---
Treasury notes should just replace the gold the point(quest driven) is to have a dependable currency that is gold backed not have gold being the currency
---
Yes. I‚Äôm Xbox or id have made u a bos or marine with  + strength.
---
In one of my runs today the extra chest had 500 caps in it, which is actually a nice little bonus, so I'd say its still worth getting
---
Yes I'm in favor of any and all efforts to reintroduce the factions from the base game.
---
This is relevant to my interests.
---
What level and system u on
---
Oh thank you for the offer anyways, appreciated
---
Best theory I‚Äôve heard yet explaining this game
---
Did it today and half the people in there were under level 40. They need a level cap on the event.
---
Thanks, just did
---
This the best idea. They have one vendor.
---
I guess not do what they do randomly with legendary modules and have X in stock
---
Also, why is there a 150/day scrip machine, 1000 scrip capacity and 10 legendary modules in stock?
---
Thank you friend! :)
---
I had fun with the event. My first few runs lasted anywhere from 4 to 23 minutes. Then I finally tried my Junkie's Explosive minigun and it turned out to be too OP since I killed Earl way faster than I expected (15-20 seconds). So, for those with weapons capable of that, don't use those weapons in Adventure mode unless it looks like the team is going to lose the fight.
---
Plot twist: the scorched plague is the evolved corona virus from the future. I mean, it came from bats in both cases
---
Most events give one stars so u need a lot of those to matter
---
I plan to be careless about it in order to have something to do after that. Like, what's the point of a perfect decision if it shortens the game's lifespan?
---
Could be neat to see him pre-Ghoulification as well.
---
To preface, I'm not on PC so I don't know for sure, but given that the event is an 8 person capped instance event, I would assume it would load you in if that group isn't full, or start you fresh on a new fight if the group is full. 
---
That's just a hunch
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure prefabs come with their own foundation on the bottom. They should make options
---
To be fair, a small shoddily built item and communism go hand in hand
---
Nothing carries over from the PTS.
---
So the ‚ÄòRona vaccine is gonna be introduced via Coke‚Äôs new line, CocaRona? I dig it!
---
Wow. And yet my caps are reduced? Isnt the logic wrong?
---
It's almost as if Bethesda don't play their own game.
---
Hey, I didn't notice this, thanks a lot
---
I play a vampires heavy build and it is the best, can't remember the last time I died in a battle, just wish 308 rounds were easier to come by.
---
Good call. I have that and an AE LMG I carry. Guess I better get some ammo
---
Is there a difference in trade value of unopened packs vs trading in 4 individual cards?
---
Yes, except it will not be called CocaRona, it will be called CocaWithMyPissInIt
---
Yeah it wasn't til his son took control that they become more reclusive 
---
His son was pretty xenophobic, there's a holotape somewhere in Fort Defiance where I remember he expressed frustration to Tagerrdy about his son disagreeing with his leadership decisions
---
How about the fact gold bullion is not new anymore and they should start adding more ways to get it like script.
---
Hey look everybody! It‚Äôs schrodinger‚Äôs douchebag!
---
Concentrated fire and VATS to the fusion core. If it is a critical hit, it means you need a single shot and can't fail.
---
Comment from another user:
---
" I fixed this briefly:  I have been having the respawn bug for a while. The one where if you are auto-respawned, like at an event or in an interior, you cannot move, and only have the option to press space to respawn (again). This also happens if you die and chose your respawn point too close to the location you died at. If there is a loading screen, the bug doesn't happen.  I removed all armor, all mutations, all perks, and have it was not fixed. It is unlikely a problem with carry weight.
---
It happens on all my characters, including a brand new one.  I reset the graphics settings in the nvidia control panel, and disabled MSI Afterburner. I restarted the game, and the bug was gone for about 5 minutes, then it came back. I don't think this was a coincidence, as it was the first time I have been able to respawn at the location I died as well as in an interior (West Tek) in a long time. I don't know why this would have fixed the bug briefly, but maybe someone who knows more about computers does.  I haven't been able to replicate this. If anyone has any ideas I would greatly appreciate it."
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a little too easy to chew through ammo with vampire. Even with high yield ammos like 5mm. Today I started with maybe 12k 5mm and after going through Colossal Problem 2-3 times today i was down to 2.8k.
---
Are you talking about A Collosal Problem? I agree to an extent. If there is not much time left on the clock and you have the opportunity to win the fight with weapons obtainable in the game then that seems reasonable.
---
Then again, certain weapons will take out the new raid boss in 10 seconds flat so that's a thing for people to not do in Adventure servers.
---
I'm pretty sure this wasn't on the PTS. Had it been, this bug probably would have been resolved beforehand.
---
buying this is why this game is a pile of garbage. we do this to ourselves.
---
The video is probably out of date. It used to be in the Military Wing and it was at random whether it would be there or not.  
---
When they smoothed out how vendors work they made a lot of the variable plans constant.
---
Keep an eye out for tales from the west Virginia hills #5.

So you can craft the hood separately from the outfit? I really want a cool hood
---
Or I can buy the plan and then craft them for me and my friends. We all benefit.
---
I also happen to run a low health heavy build with a VE Lmg. Best tip I could give someone with ammo troubles is put a prime reciever on that thing and all your ammo troubles will go away and as an added bonus you also get to do a little more damage.
---
I love the thing, got it on my 3rd run tonight, it‚Äôs my new go-to mask. Certainly need a outfit
---
No. I wont have it. All of you have too much to live for. I will carry this burden.
---
It's usually just ore, caps, I think I pulled some stims and a disease cure earlier.  
---
It's nice to get but by no means the biggest deal if you miss it.
---
Level 87, PC.
---
Did you take berry mentats? It will boost intelligence and highlight living creatures with a pink glow.
---
I've never seen this cheat/glitch/hack/whatever you want to call it in the wild...seems like it's a hard to do one since if it was easy...wouldn't we get more of these popping up?
---
Getting in power armor used to not increase my weight by anything. It decreased my max weight because of no backpack, but this is weird. Is this a recent change or a bug?
---
I have never expected them to be able to fix anything without breaking other part of the games in any patches. Pun intended
---
I just hope this doesn't turn into another Radiation Rumble where people purposely try to fail it so they can just farm what they want instead.
---
I‚Äôm Xbox or Id have made u a set. Get a set of excavator with calibrated shocks. And less than 100 carry weight out of PA is very low.
---
You still get the quest reward, which is where the Cursed weapons and plans are.  
---
There's no real downside to being caught in the collapse, other than missing out on the thrill of the run and the chest at the end.
---
the fact thay youre lugging around commando weapons and heavy weapons is probably a pretty good indicator that you haven't specialised in one type of weapon which is a must if you want to do any meaningful damage.
---
Use green thumb perk.
---
That‚Äôs where I got mine. I always give it go, just so I can get some consolation from the usual Murmgh-induced disappointment.
---
Your caps don‚Äôt come from your main character, your PTS character is 100% separate from the live game. It‚Äôs usually a copy from up to a week before the PTS went live, so the things you have will be a bit different.
---
costs a ton of materials to do
---
My good Gentle Sires, I a meek young Squire shall carry this burden for our esteemed Paladins so that you may patrol the wastes free of this great and terrible burden.
---
Ahh, ok.
---
Apparently they think they'll have ready for consoles this weekend but....I'm not holding my breath
---
The burden to have to deal with that many issues is too much for one man. I shall take up the call and join you to prevent bugs, for an honorable cause of course
---
I was impressed by that too.
---
I was like "fuck" when shit hit the fan. Great ending to that fight. Now to grind for that mask.
---
Agree. Double the daily limit to balance the inputs and outputs
---
Fallout 1st.
---
Nah, this was Free Range, there was a wolf legendary, which I was fine with, but then the sheepsquatch spawned, and was dead in a millisecond.
---
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! üéÇüéâ
---
Not today.
---
I like the bunker a lot, floating furniture aside of course. Hopefully that gets fixed. For my minimalistic character (who was living in the just the seedy shack beforehand), it's a space upgrade (~twice as big) and looks very utilitarian and cool.
---
The reused garage door sound is horrendous though, since it plays much longer than the time the bunker door actually takes to open/close.
---
In unrelated news, the hazmat cooler backpack isn't centered I think, it looks way further left of my character's center.
---
I just three manned it on my server with a couple strangers and we ran out of time with him at 1/6th hp left. We would have beaten him given 5 more minutes. Tons of stimpaks and ammo completely wasted here too.
---
Go talk to the overseer and it will finish the quest. You may need to complete I Am Become Death first... After that you'll be able to drop them if you want.
---
So that's how that happens eh? Iv'e lost out on a lot of loot from that bs. To the point i don't even bother to show up to the nuked events, not until i get my Gauss shotty. I never get credit these days.
---
Chainsaw,  with mods, absolutely devastates enemies actually. It got buffed in wastelanders.
---
screw that
---
I started back up with Destiny recently and the more I get into it, the more I feel ashamed and embarrassed about how much time I‚Äôve invested in 76. They simply can‚Äôt fix a problem without creating three more somewhere else. Shit, they can‚Äôt get the cosmetic stuff right. And that is their source of money!
---
That's a terrible idea. They already break easily.
---
Nah, I don't do those dailies after I got max rep. I prefer ANY daily (including someone to talk to) over talking to Ward
---
Yeah, I carry around a weapon with less damage output for those events so I'm not killing the boss / mini-boss too quickly.
---
This is not about "squeezing" out every bit of value, it is about making rewards feel like rewards, we don't need to agree on this but I think it would be very beneficial for general player enjoyment if they actually felt rewarded for killing legendary enemys and doing events instead of being continuously disappointed.
---
Dude this is awesome! I'm going to try doing all this whenever there's a double XP event so I can get my characters up to 50. Haven't played recently so I didn't even know public teams were a thing, I might check that out too. Thanks for the tips!
---
Doubtful, who honestly needs hundreds of screws. When they can be so readily collected from this event. More likely they'll want the XP. But you can always trust on someone with an OP weapon flexing with Earl.
---
If you get the respawn bug you might as well server hop too
---
Yeah but if the quest isn‚Äôt showing up it wont count, she won‚Äôt be there
---
Well now that you mention it...
---
Honestly, same.
---
I had a friend who was stuck in the event even though the rest of us completed it. He just killed wendigo spawns and gained a ton of XP
---
Do you think I would be able to still get to the damage threshhold on an SBQ fight? And is it so bad on the PTS that they may buff them? To be honest from what I have played on it nothing but heavy guns or commando is even viable for the larger level 100 enemys in the bog (Mirelurk queen as an example, I wasn't able to kill it with anything I owned, unarmed, rifle, bows though I only have rank two cards for rifles)
---
Chainsaw is my sbq weapon when she lands. It definitely doesn't need abuff haha. Giving it fuel would be, imo,  dumb because it's a melee weapon. This isn't destiny where swords need ammo lol
---
Please tell me that's not a bug, but a feature! ;)
---
It was compared to the Ammo converter when it was brought up.
---
I remember a dev specifically said it was going to be one of the reward in Armor Ace....
---
But guess it‚Äôs Greenhouses insteas
---
Difference is it's a broken item so it shouldn't be producing junk
---
Cool. Why? 1k kills everything. I feel like this mindset removes fun from the game. I'm genuinely curious.
---
Earlier today (Tuesday)
---
That...is a big rug.
---
With the sheer lack of flat spots... one must assume they wanted us having to get creative with our spaces. 
---
Having a terraforming tool would eliminate that, as we'd be able to have flat perfect spots anywhere.
---
What spec are you?
---
The suspense of possibly being caught, possibly catching a chance to have a team of two sit right in front of your bush and fall victim to you, is AMAZING. 
---
My bush rider friend, you must ride the bush correctly. I shall teach you if you‚Äôll come under my wing.
---
I have made it all the way down to just me and one other opponent before, completely in bushes. I frequently land in the top 10.
---
Because I have a bloodied commando that can solo the queens and dish out 2k plus a shot with a handmade or fixer. So Bordom set in a little and I decided to make one of my mikes into a melee bloodied. See if I can kill the queen in 5 or so hits
---
Thank you for that tip. I have a junkies shotgun build and I was struggling to do damage that fight. I went 1/2 (we failed the first time around). I will switch to anti-armor weapons. Thanks again.
---
It's floating in the promo pic. Not false advertising when you can just say the customer wasn't paying close enough attention. :/
---
I‚Äôll carry the burden for you my friend
---
go show them to her, once you do she should comment on it and that will finish the quest resulting in being able to drop the tapes.
---
she will be in her house as usual un-quest marked.
---
Uhhh...hodgepodge. High strength, some agility and perception, intelligence... I haven‚Äôt really made a real build yet, just using whatever perks sound useful.
---
Nah, buy it, then bitch about it... then get it for free like i did my Mr Fuzzy ride 2 summers ago lol.
---
Its simple, no.
---
I always run concentrated fire and maxed enforcer. One, maybe 2 pops per wing and you can land a scorchbeast
---
Im on Xbox but please Bethy, I‚Äôd crash test everything you threw at me so people could comfortably play
---
I bought this. How do I get my atoms back and return this garbage bundle?
---
They never (not once) said they want to focus on pvp and raiding. Like ever.
---
ü§´
---
&gt; I previewed the bunker in build mode
---
How?
---
I use both and the one under agility that cripples....can't remember the name
---
Thank you, I appreciate it, and I'm sure alot of other players do as well.
---
Humble eh?
---
t-45 and t-60
---
It was heavily insinuated at the start of the game, especially during survival mode. They also said they wanted people to heavily invest in roleplaying. Also the whole reason there was never NPC's until wastelands is officially "We didn't think people would want Human NPC's as they would take the roles of raiders, traders, and settlers". They literally said NPC's weren't on their radar because they intended for us to take those roles.
---
As crazy as this answer sounds...it was us players. Their original intent was to have alot of pvp in this game but after they realized that instead of killing each other every we time into contact we were actually being nice! I assume thats why this game didn't originally have teams because after looking into other MMOs and how toxic everyone was to each other they thought it would be a free for all and in this gaming community that just isn't the case. I absolutely hate online games because I've never been that guy that gets a 10-1 or better kill/death ratio so it was never any fun for me but after now playing this game I'm not sure I can ever go back to single player games.
---
Actually thats all they talked about when the game launched.
---
let‚Äôs call it kvatch.
---
Wow, that's impressive. Does the gun have other 'magic' effects other than being junkies? I have JE Minigun too and it doesn't seem to do much from a damage perspective.
---
Fair enough üëå
---
I report them all, every time.  It screws up the server, and I've wasted more time and effort only to later find these idiot cheaters on there with me.
---
An opt in pvp option would have been the coolest way to do it. Similar to how it is now. Hell you could even keep the looting/stealing on and simply have a pacifist option as you do now and let other bounty hunters deal with it. It seems the lack of decent pvp engagement system in the form of needing to have someone shoot back kinda ruined it.
---
Hail Caesar
---
I fucking wish. Two junky fences, two plain ones, and they couldn't bother to give us the doorway or gate from fo4. Same with the barbed wire fence in the new communist bundle. Just a single fence piece with no gate. :/
---
No they didn't. Link me such interview or post.
---
Using a set of excavator armor, I had enough ore to net about 650-800 lead scrap with super duper. Using super duper and ammosmith helps with amassing, and then like someone else said, you get more ammo overall from making ultracite ammo variants.
---
for example - roasted SB heart gives 400hp. two would be 800 over a period of time. use as needed
---
Probably their last one.. I know they are a pain to make but I don't know why people get mad at me for stating the price I find them for sale. I have only paid 350 a couple of times and that was only because I as at 30k again.  Seems like my stash is always at 790, my bank at 30k and my script is some 1 chest piece shy of 1k.  I just want to kill some ghouls but it's time for inventory management.  Soon I will be collecting gold so then I will have that to deal with üòã
---
Ah very good thanks :)
---
That's why they suck.  They screw up servers for other people.
---
3 times,
---
1 time run out of time(boss killed but no chest)
---
2nd time boss killed, but got stuck in shitload of wendingos and earraped to death. 
---
3rd time is a charm, but boss and chest are BS rols...
---
They didn't "insinuate" anything of the sorts. All they talked about was a light survival roleplay adventure game. Not once did they mention game development was focusing on pvp or raiding. Link me a post or interview where they say that.
---
There's a spot next to Earle, to the right of him there is a little area you can stand in and shoot him. There is nothing that will kill you, except the obvious. I.e Earles spit and wendigos but no falling ceiling, radiation, or drills.
---
If you aren't a specific build, I'd personally suggest SS Armor, all limbs buttressed.  Best protection if you don't play power armor.  Then jetpack it.  Cushion the legs, then add the extra carry weight to the arms when they release those mods hopefully later this week.
---
Then use gold to buy whatever you want to play with.  Chinese stealth armor if you didn't play Foundation quests far enough yo get it for free before fully committing to the raiders.  The plans for planting foundations, or whatever.
---
nonono, i got this. im a camp builder, its basically my job
---
Its crazy to think about that I could probably do a better job making it with the modding experience I have and by looking at the creation kit wiki and youtube tutorials from other modders......
---
Please allow vendors to perform the same function as the ammo converter.
---
I went back to NV Dust recently and good God does the ripper have an appetite for destruction.
---
I like to be near a road and have a source of water near by I used to have my camp in the mountains but I didn't think that was very realistic so I moved to along the Ohio river and the sunsets are very nice I even have a dock behind my house

Good. It's not a mobile game
---
Unless you're on specific WL quests she'll always be at her house. The quest marker doesn't show up for it, but when you talk to her you'll have a dialog option about the holotapes. Select it and complete the quest.
---
It literally says in the Bethesda article I linked that survival mode was intended to be a high stakes pvp mode.
---
You might wanna do some research on running bloodied builds at this event. I don‚Äôt know enough about them to tell you if its doable or not. I just know you can take a lot of damage if your not careful. I ran a Full health heavy build using X- 01 armor and still took a decent amount of damage. 
---
The biggest problem you might have is bloodied dies really easy and if you die during the event. You can get hit with the respawn bug where it forces you to travel away and back again. Only once the fight starts the tunnel closes and you can‚Äôt get back in. Leaving you to have to wait outside until the event ends. You won‚Äôt get to loot earl. Supposedly waiting outside still gets you rewards but I don‚Äôt know. Iv been lucky and haven‚Äôt been hit by that bug yet. 
---
For the actual fight The main thing your gonna have to watch out for is getting swarmed by wendigos. I think He summons around 3 to 5 of them at a decent rate. Your also going to want to watch for his poison spit and these weird puddles on the ground that does health damage. His fear attack is easy enough to dodge. Just stay way back. Occasionally i still get caught in it but most the time its easy enough to avoid.
---
Now don‚Äôt let any of that stop you. In my opinion the event is absolutely fun and worth the effort but bloodied builds may or may not need some tweaking to survive in it.
---
If you like power armour then I would suggest a power armour build, but then it depends what weapons you want to use.
---
And survival mode was in the game, but very few player used that mode, so they scraped it. It failed.
---
Honestly you figure out how you want to build your player as you play I'm lvl 144 and just started getting into the bloodied builds before that I just had fun playing.
---
Yet another reason why they need to scrap perk scrapping.
---
Gas,grass,or ass no free rides
---
Like obviously you know the game has been out before wastelanders right?
---
Ok good thanks!! I always get stressed going into games like this, because I always feel like if I don't start building early I'll never be "effective" later.
---
How many hours does it take roaming around to collect the amount you get from this event?
---
Thank you. I got it.
---
Not a single one of those links say anything about them focusing on pvp or raiding. Not one.
---
Dude he cant be this dumb, hes just trolling.
---
I sell all my excess plans from 5 to 100 caps regardless of what it is. I just want it gone. Same with ammo. I usually try and sell Missiles and mini nukes vs scrapping them. At the end of the day they eat up my stash box room. Plus almost every Daily objective has a buy/sell 3 items to a player making it dirt cheap helps both me and the other player by knocking it out easily and for a cheap price.
---
It depends on what other fx and what kind of armor it is for UYD, granted, if I was just getting my armor for bloodied I'd buy that in a heart beat. 
---
I've also found that people won't visit your camp unless you have a ton of crap listed. Whenever I start playing again I may start listing a bunch of junk weapons and armor just so people see the few legendaries I'm selling.
---
I will say it is good to in with an idea of things you want to do. But you dont need a build right away.
---
I just tried placing these down in my bunker and it doesn't shine off the walls for me, it's just a rotating useless ball for me
---
If you nuke the fissure site across from the pumpkin house, you'll get the surrounding area which has a lot of cobalt flux, but you also get the little fall festival location next to the fissure with corn that turns into cobalt flux.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Yup. And it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs some reason to loop around- you‚Äôre not under any real threat if you keep moving, there‚Äôs  no real loot to speak of...
---
How is that "focusing on pvp and raiding" if they just talk about pvp elements in the game.
---
I mean, you can take workshops or play Nuclear Winter? If the community, in general, didn't engage in PVP what's the point in trying to crowbar it in now?
---
Also, PVP is opt in. You shoot someone, someone shoots you back, PVP ensues.
---
That rug really ties the wasteland together
---
I'm intrigued...why speed through the start then delete?
---
Awesome story... next time you‚Äôre running around like a BOSS... don‚Äôt forget to check the petrified corpses. Just learned this yesterday they actually have loot unlike adventure mode. Just a side note to your looting all the best stuff but never being able to do anything with it
---
Yes i have played from beta. Not once did they say they will focus on pvp / raiding. You have not yet given any proof of that.
---
If you do put together that load out, I‚Äôd be interested in seeing it!
---
If I don‚Äôt die with three stims on me, I wasn‚Äôt playing
---
Tbh it sounds like you want PVP on your terms which is not what the game is about anymore (if it ever was).
---
Perhaps you'd be better off looking for a game that meets your requirements?
---
They designed the PvP so poorly to the point that it only benefited griefers, then were surprised when nobody except griefers liked it.
---
For Honor flashbacks intensify.
---
I'm catch a bug too. I can't take my weapon in hands. Any weapon! Not from pipboy, not from wheel.
---
Not sure why you were down voted.  You are right, and since it's a heavy if his build was good he'd have stabilzed meaning an aa gun wouldn't add much extra damage, at most like 13%. That combined with aa still not functioning properly on energy weapons makes me feel like something is missing from his story
---
I have had no issues with him.  Rocksy?  I get him to work maybe one day in 4.
---
Why this delay, where did you get this info? I can't find anything online
---
Clearly YOU are very mad. I play this game every day after I WORK. How the fuck am I gonna finish this long ass thing if I‚Äôm gone all day working? You fucking idiot take your dumbass comment and shove it up your ass.
---
All SMGs is auto rifles
---
Very nice write up. You PC players just keep working on it, us console peeps can wait a little bit. Thanks
---
Because the community is largely a bunch of soft ass loners that don‚Äôt want to do anything but fight AI enemies and hoard. The toxic wheel gets the grease, so Bethesda always bend so to the PVE crowd.
---
Yea I saw a video and I‚Äôm complaining. You got a problem with that?
---
I had this problem with my boys. Explain that what youre doing is playing a game. That no one is killed or hurt and they dont exists. May take more then once.
---
Have you tried the market sub?
---
In your camp just go into build mode and select it in the misc. tab.  You can rotate, zoom in out, etc.  without unlocking it.  It will be kinda ghostly but you can have a good look.
---
&gt; Go to raid a camp 
---
&gt; Steal items
---
&gt; Get a fat red mark above you
---
&gt; Get immediately hunted down by everyone with a gun who tp to your nearest fast travel location
---
It's honestly not really pvp or raiding in any reasonable sense
---
Awesome, it really, really doesn‚Äôt bother him, sort of thing, he gets really excited popping the big bat bird and robots... just don‚Äôt want to raise a psychopath!
---
No I was looking for raiding, so I can be a raider, once I join the raiding faction. hell I'd be fine with it just being raiding NPC camps, but that doesn't exist. What do the raiders even do?
---
Don‚Äôt worry about having a build in early game you can have fun messing around with the variety of weapons and perks this game offers. You‚Äôll need to figure out a build once you‚Äôre in endgame and by that time youll already be used to the game and tried different weapons and perks. So just enjoy the game for now and try everything you can do you can learn about the differences
---
Same could be said for the opposition though, couldn‚Äôt it? If other people bother you, there are fallout titles where you can play all by yourself.
---
I appreciate the offer. I'll see your recommendation out. Yeah, I had to try and cut out the weight as much as possible to get my PA to work.
---
And when you get milked Todd says "moo"
---
I'm sworn to carry your burdens.
---
And you are one of the stupid people populating it
---
Friendly reminder that the playerbase very vocally shouted down anyone who requested this feature. Because "it'll ruin my immersion if I see someone shouting LTS %4...". 
---
Reap what you sow.
---
idk. I'm on console. but it usually takes me an hour or two to sweep the server of any junk I prioritise (lead, steel, screws, springs etc)
---
So really, not long at all. and it saves me the frustration of being around people who only junk-farm during events, which fortunately prevents me from having any reasons to post whining about people not chipping into events. like this post.
---
and like I said, after ONE sweep, i end up with up to 4.5k scrap. win.
---
The one solution my friend found was exiting and reloading the zone. This only helps with looting cleanup after the event though. I just truck through the 1 frame every 3 seconds until the event ends, then teleport out and back to loot.
---
Anyone know when the legendary run ends? I cant find out.
---
What kind of weapon is the caster?  Wondering what perks work with it
---
Honestly Bethesda this would he a wonderful way for you to have some free labor give it to this guy
---
Happy bday. Do you run a bloodied build by any chance?
---
*edit* I'm an idiot. I should've noticed the full HP üòÖ
---
I'm not really looking forward to seeing those abominations hopping around meat week...
---
They indeed did say they meant the game to be pvp focused, and were quite disappointed that no one pvps.
---
They give loot in adventure mode too but it's just super uncommon.
---
Dude all im saying is this is the fastest way to farm screws...
---
Protect and copper
---
Where? All they have said was they were disappointed people didn't like pvp. I'm still waiting on the post/comment about them saying they are focusing on pvp/raiding.
---
No shit!?!? All I have ever gotten was rads ü§£ü§£RNGesus for ya
---
You know perhaps you're right and I really just misunderstood a lot of the concepts. It would be cool at the very least to have NPC camps I can raid as part of a radiant quest system tied to the raiders. That would be a cool compromise.
---
I really think they made this game so when they make the next one it‚Äôs god tier compared to this shit storm
---
Feels oddly sexual yet satisfying
---
Maybe they should change the repeatable to complete 10 events instead of 10k XP.
---
I'd hope so, I'm jealous of the overseer's basement, main floor, and second floor with all decorations. Cheating wench.
---
Make sure you dont have the future tec skin on your C.A.M.P if you move it otherwise your camp wont show up on the map till you replace it with skin turned off :/ spent a few hours rebuilding my base only to learn this and having to restart.  On the plus side though the future tec camp was glitched and letting me use wallpapers from the atom shop that i did not have purchased lol
---
Research, and then more research. Wiki has loads of information. Look into some discords and ask a lot of questions no matter how it may appear to sound it never hurts to ask. Assimilate, think and formulate. Take it slow there really is no rush. There are some YouTubers that are right on the money with their explanations.
---
papering over the craps.
---
- All kids stuff and paints have lead in them.
---
- Always go in a public team (even if you have to create a new empty one) and equip your inspirational perk for an easy XP boost. 
---
- cook everything you can and sell the extra foods and drinks to a vendor bot for quick caps. 
---
- always do the wolves pack event when available. Easy 1* legendary farming when in need of weapons, armor or scrips. 
---
- Hoard on the following, keep the rest around 100: lead, screws, gears, acid, ballistic fiber (and anything else you will see suggested)
---
- Favorite (heart) your weapons and apparels you don‚Äôt want to accidentally scrip or scrap.
---
Going to break it to you, nothing is worth doing that they consider endgame (no actual endgame is in the game). It's just a massive ammo dump for no or little reward. 
---
The forever question when doing anything is "why?" on 76.
---
Well no, because as mentioned, the community decided in general that, PVP wasn't what they wanted in the game. 
---
And it's not about wanting to play alone, it's about not wanting to be ganked by high level players.
---
I‚Äôll buy 20 off you for 350
---
Yeah tell me about it. Tonight on Xbox we had two queen fights and after the first queen fight I took on the colossus by myself because no one seen me waving and then second one some body was down in the open and we took it down. That fight lasted a lot longer. The first fight was easy, it got stuck in the trees in the grove and took my magic junkies mini and shredded it. But then another queen fight just now. All drops where garbage. Then after last queen fight someone starts encrypted. Also nothing good, but I managed to get exactly 200 to go roll. And I get a stupid mutants middle launcher and a berserkers 10 mm sub. I have gotten about 5 berserkers dropped tonight between the two queen fights two colossus and encrypted. Then purveyor wanted to do me dirty and give me another one. I swear I‚Äôll never pull another good gun from her again. Lol
---
Yeah it's super rare but you can get rad-away, a stim, junk, or even a whole bottle cap! It's really not worth it lol.
---
Why im thrivin baby nothin but screws, treasury notes, and ptsd for me
---
I have to admit to starting doing this... sorry... but we have an atom quest to claim workshops. So the options are go to an unowned and run around looking for god knows what creatures and kill them until none left, which is very slow and annoying. Or go to an already captured one and take that. Normally the player isn't there so it's fine, but if they are, kill them quick and take it.
---
But I‚Äôve been looking for that bottle cap since I started playing the game... I want to put it in my display case
---
Thanks for the info though. Appreciate it
---
Dude, we literally get skins with failed UV maps like the suppressor on the Blood Eagle skin.
---
They are failing the most basic of texturing.
---
I don‚Äôt care about the birthday your mom set up for you
---
A vampires spect weapon can help.
---
The game did its job - it discouraged you from being a griefer. Good.
---
Again, it sounds like you want your specific variety of PVP/Raiding which, I honestly don't remember from any of the early promo stuff.
---
You can go around and steal stuff, getting a bounty but you have to be a high enough level to protect yourself. I wouldn't go chasing down a level 200 player with a bounty because I know they'd just ruin me.
---
I‚Äôve had that happen on Xbox a bunch and it happened tonight during a queen fight. But I am usually able to get it fixed by clicking the gun in pip boy.
---
Happy Birthday üéÇüéäüéâHave a great day
---
You give Bethesda far more credit than they deserve.
---
Ok thanks, will do! I'm going to take alot of time with this game
---
To be fair, the Enclave officer outfit is fucking mint
---
No no no, it will be a very hard job I'll do it for you. I don't want you to be stressed out from testing the atomic shop items
---
I'm fine with Order of Mysteries (my top pick) or some other lesser faction like Free States (#AbbieLives) or Responders.
---
After the BoS. I'd like to take at least a season's break before we bring in the Enclave or a proto Institute.
---
It‚Äôs no bug, ur have weapon amp junk or chem weight reduction armors
---
The consoles have been revving up like they're about to fly away when entering an instance area. They have a serious coding problem. I'm no genius but when that happens that's a sure sign of crypto mining. Especially if it overheats and shuts down.
---
Yeah, they might gladly offer to test that stuff at some point, but the situation won't change because they won't listen to 98% of your feedback (as it is now with PTS for the most part) and still release a buggy mess. The situation with PTS doesn't even differ much from what happened with so called b.e.t.a... We still have a plethora of bugs unfixed from these times, not to say even from fallout 4 release. Despite all the reports. Thousands of those. So yeah, unfortunately they never learn and it really shows.
---
More commie stuff!!
---
It is a heavy weapon.
---
The event is too gorgeous, I‚Äôve mainly been taking photos lol
---
Like others have said just take your time. If you want to use PA effectively all the useful perks are in intelligence so go there first
---
I‚Äôm certain the real problem is the cap on currency. I see something I‚Äôd totally spend 16k on as asked but like who‚Äôs carrying so much when 25k is risking it?
---
I wish they‚Äôd let us post ‚Äúsell‚Äù prices for what scrap we‚Äôll accept in place of caps
---
I took the pistol in my hand and it immediately fell out of it.
---
Exactly. The people making excuses for them clearly have zero knowledge when it comes to creating and implementing these assets. It's all standard fare stuff that's been the boilerplate norm since forever. Another shining example of how objectively inept this Bethesda Austin studio is at the most basic levels. 
---
In the hands of essentially any other same-sized studio you would have none of these issues. But management doesn't really realize this or there's nepotism or ***something*** going on that allows this level of quality to persist. It's gone from an amusing meme to downright contemptible. Really a massive shame.
---
Bullion machine requests outside of the current locations seems odd to me. Like the whole quest regarding the gold only involves those factions so it makes sense they have bullion machines.
---
Why would they be at the purveyor, or a train station?
---
It's really not that big of a deal to go to one of 2-3 locations to do your bullion stuff.
---
I saw one person selling maybe 5 or 6 of each serum for about 100 caps a pop. It was tempting to buy them all and flip it, but I bought one of each for my own uses. 
---
I hope others follow the same suit and act decently.
---
Ok. Well, I mean you no harm, so I hope wherever you are in the world you are healthy and have a nice day.
---
The robots have such great lines in this game..
---
whos that guy who died at Morgantown and there is a robot who is stuck defending his corpse?  
---
the robot just constantly insults the guy's corpse.. I stayed and listened to it laughing my ass off
---
I know part of the problem was figured out a little while ago relating to server time reset. It resets 12pm EST. And I guess if you had a challenge marked done, like buy 3 items from another player, it won‚Äôt turn over for the next day if you‚Äôre logged into a server. You just lose those points. So they were saying log out before when it‚Äôs close, and then and log back in.
---
ü•≥
---
When you trust Bethesda, you deserve the let down.
---
Nah. Junkie's. It's ok!
---
Don‚Äôt care
---
You won't be able to. Bethesda has been on a missing to keep nerfing the free atoms we get.
---
I wouldn't be at all surprised if in future Legendary Runs they reduce the number of Atoms that you get overall.
---
Some of my friends reported this yesterday, it doesn't always happen but it's still there. The respawn bug gets all the time though.
---
If this person is on ps4 I must hunt them down and change it to either .44 or .38 and then steal it all and give it to new peeps out of the vault.
---
25 years after the end, when the survivors are struggling to adapt to a new world, the old world still has it's appeal.
---
However, nationalism has lost it's place. No longer do people associate political beliefs with actual nation states...
---
As such, the survivors that are faced with trying to survive in the wasteland have a choice to make. What beliefs align with their own? What old world system most closely resembles their own beliefs and desires. 
---
The memories of nation states has faded. The youth never even knew America or China, they've merely been told how things went down. 
---
A lot of survivors blame America, they learn about the military experiments like FEV and the various Vault-Tec experiments and they ultimately decide that *America* was the enemy all along. 
---
They side with the commies, as they blame America for the troubles they now endure. 
---
A new war is brewing in Appalachia. One that will foreshadow events to come, like the NCR and Ceasar's legions in the Mojave.
---
This won't be a war between Raiders and Settlers as we expect. It will be a war of ideals, between new communists and old world patriots.
---
Because one thing remains true. Even in the harshest of conditions, when humanity is on the literal brink of extinction...
---
War never changes.
---
You are right there is no raiding within the game mechanics, most things you can do are meaningless with how inconsequential they are. On top of that people adapted. You have people breaking your camp? People made workshop platforms and would just move the camp every hour or so to stash things. You cannot easily implement stealing from other players in a game with such a focus on crafting, because eventually you lose the casual base who gets tired of their stuff always being broken and stolen and they just do not come back. You would have to use some manner of AI aspect to give the raiding option there.   
---
I feel that it was the early metas that really killed the PvP though. I got into 2 fights in the beginning of the game, both were over workshops and when both of us were under level 30 it was a game of shooting, grenades and a final melee. When the first meta I recall hit and people got two shot explosive guns, stacked explosive buffs and would slaughter passive players even with the protection, this was when PvP stopped being a thing I wanted to try. When it became an arms race of minmaxing and recapturing that first level of slaughter. There is a reason that every time I hear someone get into PvP when doing something with a workshop I always hear. "And I just died, well that was stupid. Waste of time." People got conditioned. PvP players have a certain reputation, a reputation most casual players saw as the peak of unfun. Showing up to kick your sand castle and laugh in your face as they steal your bucket.   
---
It is hard to make a game that encourages raider behavior, because most people cannot be raiders, they do not want to be raiders, and when your options are raid or be a victim, people eventually opt out. Sure you can do better defenses, you can lock things up or get a better gun, but eventually in my own case I just stop caring and do not even try. It comes down to the community and we showed we did not like being raiders, sure some people would be creative and raid in their own way, but the vast majority wouldn't, so the focus shifted.
---
What's your expectation of a fair reward? Perhaps you have unrealistic expectations?
---
And I see your BOS thing so if you wanna sacrifice stats for looks all the sheilded BOS under armor gives 2 strength and 3 endurance so if you prefer the bos asthmatics then go for it. But sheilded secret service gives 4 str, 2 per, and 4 end
---
‚ÄúBethesda, please raise the price of all atomic shop items!!‚Äù 
---
*Atom shop items all get discounted* 
---
‚ÄúOh shit you right‚Äù
---
Yeah this is the only real problem I have with the bunker, personally.
---
Every time I walk up the small ramp into my bunker I can see literally everything inside of it floating.
---
Ultracite plasma cartriges will not drop from vendigo spawns. Will get random common ammo instead.
---
the word of the gold being distributed around Appalachia isn't unknown and others wanting to get in on that wouldnt be farfetched, especially someone with a mining background since gold is something shiny a mole miner would likely want since they clearly hoard.
---
One of the articles said mid september
---
I just got the plushie plan from the Monogah mine event, but I can't find which station to craft one.
---
Doh!
---
I'm so used to clicking so I can only see what's buildable that I completely forget you can do that. 
---
Thanks.
---
**'We need 2 more weeks for final fixings'**.
---
Seems like finding a place to put it would be a colossal problem.
---
I'd green light many of you to do this but it's very clear that Bethesda and their monumental incompetence would rub off on all of you too. I wouldn't want to lose great people like you. I think it's best for all humans to stay far away from the inner workings of Bethesda until their management pull their heads out of their money loving asses. Stick your head in there and it's certain you will turn into a greedy asshole who no longer cares about people or your own product.
---
Well so was I. So much so that I scrapped my evil character and just did their quest on my main.
---
Ahh yes, recurring memes from the times of b.e.t.a...
---
No, that's the one thing they would do correctly.
---
You can try it multiple times in a row. Several times I got the pie on a second try.
---
Really a great event!
---
The first one we did, one guy had a glitched weapon and ruined it by melling the boss in 10sec, but the 2nd time was amazing and fun. Broke both my flamers, and my Gatling Plasma, but made it out alive!
---
Question: How do you escape the mine?  Fast travel makes you miss out on the event end reward
---
&gt;Edit: Found out the difference is the Western Revolver uses the white  skin for some reason. Annoying, but now I know what to look for at  least.
---
What you want is the [True Grip.](https://i.imgur.com/yWJ5mjU.jpg) I know they're not the most powerful weapons in the game, but wheel guns can put in some work, and they sure are fun to shoot. There's a really satisfying punch to a big iron that the delicate *thwip-thwip-thwip* of a suppressed handmade simply can't match.
---
Just to make sure I can use all these items, how about you increase my budget x50?
---
I will get downvoted for this, but please don't simplify my game sessions.
---
I would like a reason to travel around Appalachia. This idea would just dumb it down for me. If we had profound player hubs, on the other hand, places where you could get tons of quests and errands to go complete and then return to, then yeah I would love this idea more. Now it's just Ward in Foundation, two other girls at Crater and that's it. The majority of tasks get handed to you automatically based on your location and you don't even need to turn in most of them.
---
True, but I‚Äôm a scientist at heart, and I‚Äôm sure the soldiers would prefer some fatigues that aren‚Äôt skin tight.
---
I'm also disappointed that my BoS character can't even hurt them. My evil character couldn't be evil. It would be great if we could get negative rep with factions. Foundation could shoot at and chase my raider character away. And the raiders could send death squads after my BoS character.
---
Can it survive a nuke?
---
Happened to me...
---
A lot of people don't do daily quests so it would help us.
---
Da
---
Sorry im two months late
---
That's what it is! I had it today and didn't know wtf was going on. Literally made me turn the Xbox off for the day (it was almost time for me to get ready for work anyway) lol I was afraid the ol box was dying on me.
---
Omg I literally had the same idea reading this that would be amazing!
---
Ok will do, idk why I absolutely love power armor
---
I run a PA build. What level you at just now?
---
Thanks for all the advice! Now just have to track the stuff down haha
---
hmmm.... are you online now? and what kind of Junkies weapons are you interested in
---
Thats nice
---
Wait that‚Äôs still not patched?
---
I‚Äôm sure I saw people saying it got patched in the last update but you have to place it again if you already have it down?
---
I could be wrong.
---
I don't have the game yet, it's coming in 2 days!
---
Tesla shotgun doesn‚Äôt benefit from shotgun perks AFAIK. Start with a Pump, work to a Combat, and with a Gauss (double barrel just had too few rounds for my taste).
---
Everything too looks forward to then. What platform you on?
---
I have mine on a wallpaper but it‚Äôs a wooden one. Then when I go to move the poster I can‚Äôt. I have to change the wallpaper or remove the wall to get the poster in my inventory to replace it
---
Sign
---
Me up
---
Ps4
---
One would think you'd be used to the disappointment by now.
---
Maybe a team leader can send a team invite/teleport to a event? That would be cool.
---
I'm on PS4 too, let me know when you get to level 15 and I'll knock you out some raider PA then I'll help you onto excavator PA.
---
What the other person said and also when the other space ship on the board reach's the end, an easy way to figure out when it ends and how far ahead you are
---
You have no idea how the PTS works do you?
---
When they open the PTS they make a copy of your character from a few days prior. From that point on they‚Äôre entirely separate with zero crossover.
---
Ur good at least someone finished it
---
I like an area fairly flat, not too far from a train station and also with a water source as I like building up purified water for caps.
---
There‚Äôs a few good areas just east of top of the world and the train station there with water. Not super flat, but plenty of building room, especially if you build out over the water. It‚Äôs also a good spot on the map with lots of player traffic nearby.
---
I've had enough of that BS to make it a point to use mine responsibly. Unless I'm by myself, I'll cut down 1/4-1/3 hp and then switch to something else unless things go sideways. 
---
I prefer to use my non-magic gauss minigun that I worked so hard for over my magic minigun that I literally found on the ground.
---
I've had this happen both times I've tried to do this event. I didn't even get the xp for completely the event.
---
Maybe every day can add whatever to a max weekly limit, at the end of the week you have the full limit unlocked.
---
Dang thank you so much, most people in games never help new players, I truly do appreciate it!!!
---
Does Xbox have a walk option? When I first started I would sometimes get on and the default movement was walking instead of running. It‚Äôs like forward slash to toggle it for me
---
You'll find the opposite here.
---
If your normal carry weight is only 95, you have like zero strength. PA sets your strength to some minimum level (I think 15?), so that might be where your carry weight comes from
---
Turn on passive mode.
---
Happy Birthday. How does it taste?
---
That's great to hear thanks!
---
Just turn on your pacifist mode
---
I‚Äôd wait until it‚Äôs live. Probably will be changed and tweaked by that time.
---
My PSN is: Shablagoobuddy
---
There should be a tunnel marked exit. It tries to branch many times but keep going left. Some have said they didn't make it out and still got the rewards and didn't drop their junk, but YMMV.
---
Aww that sucks, another to add to the list to report.
---
No, I logged off after I nuked Monongah and literally not one person showed up for it. So that was a bit depressing. But since it would be rude not to answer, I run heavy gunner/commando depending on the situation
---
Since I didn't see this in the original post, don't move the bunker once placed with a door unless you want a floating door where it was originally placed. Still functions as well. For amusing as that is, I still intend to get a refund, already got one for the red scare PA because it has the same issue with the T-65 helm that the original one did. This whole release was a disaster.
---
Executioners. Same on the shovel. Pickaxe is bloodied. All 3 are 90% reduced weight.
---
I saw a settler raider shoot out in the wild. Naturally, I helped my raider brothers. They do fight but it appears to be a random event.
---
I have a pristine miner outfit that's  really nice. But I don't have the reclaimed deep mining gas mask :/
---
Correct. The weapons and effects are fixed.
---
That is NOT what she said.
---
You made me spit out my milk.
---
When you log in, you'll have a quest to talk to Maggie at Foundation. Then you nuke Monongah Mine and the event will start.
---
if you can log on now, ill give you a bday gift. i think i have something you can use
---
Suspiciously perfect.
---
Nope, no repair kits sadly.
---
Well good thing I‚Äôm already level 100 :/
---
Not yet.
---
.... nah. 
---
It costs 500 coins to fully upgrade ONE card. Perk card is worth 2 points. 36x5=180+580=720x2=1440.
---
6 perk slots x500 =3000.
---
You won‚Äôt even max out 3.
---
Unless you think it costs to buy the first rank? Cause first rank costs nothing but your max level.
---
They are not rare anymore, the OP had been looking in the wrong vendor.
---
I mean to be fair though, they're not stupid. They know what you're capable of.  They even call you a legend when you wander crater.  Would you pick a fight with a fighter who took on the Queen and fought an army of scorched all at once while in a nuke zone?
---
Yeah, I have a problem with outrage-mongering "content creators" stirring up shit for clicks. It's astonishing how many people only get mad after watching a provocative video, and then they come in here regurgitating someone else's opinion. The insipid bandwagoning is really tiresome.
---
That's super sweet of you, I can't get back on tonight but I'm always on in the evenings, IGN is hotmessmandy on PC
---
any and all non perk related wight reduction bonuses are removed when in power armor if they are linked to armor/backpacks. these include legendary weight reduction effects and chemist/grocer's backpack mods
---
If we had run into each other in NW, I would have run to the nearest bush and hid and hoped that you were afk and did not notice....
---
ah ok np. ill see if youre on tomorrow around the same time then.
---
I did not know that... I‚Äôve always had a whole group panicking in area chat screaming it‚Äôs dark, we‚Äôre almost out of time, I‚Äôm scared, I don‚Äôt wanna die, I don‚Äôt want to lose my loot, etc. You can imagine what it‚Äôs like when 7 people are panicking with their mics on. An experience.
---
The scorchbeast YASSS QUEEN
---
... you must be on the PTS. Post this on the Bethesda PTS forums.
---
Nice! 
---
When I‚Äôm in NW for challenges, lately, I‚Äôve started building useless camp stuff. Mr Fuzzy rides, comfy chairs, etc.
---
I'd like an event where we help a friendly deathclaw defend it's nest and babies.
---
&gt; Not wanting politics in Fallout
---
Now from where you're sitting it seems like you've had an apolitical run of peace, but the truth is: the series was political from the start.
---

---
There's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and junkies for big fights. Been running this build for 200 odd levels now and find it very solid
---
Bud... did you pay attention to *anything* about prewar USA?
---
Bethesda should definitely read this, great research
---
I use them to ignite cars.
---
Keep that shit in your mouth! Do you know how hard we worked to make that for you? YOU'LL DRINK IT AND YOU'LL LIKE IT!
---
Maybe some Old Possum or Sunset Sasparilla posters or signs would be cool too.
---
Sent a friend request, can't wait!
---
Keep them simple and they work. Have any sort of wall decor or floor decor and good luck getting it to place.
---
You're probably stuck in aiming down sights mode. Happens to me often in PA.
---
It's like moving at aiming speed even after it zooms out in first and third person.
---
If it's that a reload,  weapon change, or bashing gets me out.
---
I like to collect poison or waterbreathing armor
---
Looks pretty awesome, took screenshots so I could mix and match and make a build I love, thanks!
---
Si
---
I think unarmed is the only weapons that only have a 20% increase from perks - wondering if its going to get more perk cards?
---
That would then bring it close to where it needs to be.
---
I was unaware LS could be sold.
---
Came across a vendor last night selling bulk insect parts for 9999 caps a piece.
---
Heck yea, I just need to find a good legendary Western Revolver now, I'm not sure how many people keep those specific ones.
---
I would have just kept walking but would have looked your way
---
Of course, always happy to offer advice. I'd set you up with some gear but looks like you're on ps4 and I'm over on xbox
---
Simply put dps are just the opposite, that is why people call them glass cannons. We can't take multiple sustained damage from the hordes around the boss like tanks can if BETHESDA had created a REAL tanking mechanic and healing mechanic then the tank can collect the hordes and keep aggro on the boss while the healer heals the tank and DPS TAKES OUT the horde and the boss. 
---
TLDR - This is purely the fault of the mechanics of the game and the dependence to self heal and inability to crowd control/gain aggro.
---
Yeah I want free shit too!!!!
---
I'd assume under lights
---
I'm already geared super well so I don't need presents (but the offer was so generous and nice) buut I am always accepting cool new ppl on my friends list in game ‚úå
---
Would love to be able to play with you, but sadly I don't think their is any cross play of sorts :)
---
You new guys are great ! I got the forest camo jumpsuit off a level 35 the other day for 250 caps.
---
Could not believe what i was looking at ( been farming for this jumpsuit since April) 
---
Normally I would message the person and tell them that said item is priced to low but I just couldn't do it this time and bought it and fast travelled away asap.
---
Sorry new person for taking one of the most rare items in the game off you for a  pittance as you didn't know what you had.
---
no,I dont want YOU to get stressed out,i will do it
---
They should be paying people to do this, stop offering your ass to them on a silver platter.
---
It really is
---
I sometimes do but I have bad RNG I guess üòÖ
---
Out of curiosity, what were you talking about?
---
I am pretty sure it‚Äôs under table lamps.
---
I played NW on launch and know Flatwoods so well. I vote for it everytime because Morgantown is the map chosen 80% of the time. I can't wait for a new map.
---
How do you get it to shine like that, mine just rotate but don't put out the shapes?
---
Shhhhh.  Don't lower the price of the now artificially high priced screws.
---
Lol he mad
---
Spend a few weekends farming materials. There really is not simple way of obtaining ammo esp the gauss mg
---
Wasnt planning on dying
---
I actually stepped away from the game. Decided to take a break once Ghost of Tsushima came out. Pair that with me getting everything I wanted/needed...not much to do. Gave some stuff away but kept a few others. If you have a JE15fr Gat Plasma then I understand!
---
What i hate is the game is structured in such a way that i like but also hate. I love the franchise.
---
Did you craft a plushie? If so, what bench do you craft it on?
---
Perfect concrete
---
Last year i did the same and it took me a year too sell out all masks.
---
It is indeed a table lamp
---
It's the prize bot, just a random encounter. All you get is the junk he gave you, and a note that's not worth anything
---
"Her Royal Highness Flame Kat Princess"?   LOL!   Okay, I want to know some of your cat stories.    You wouldn't happen to have a flame-point Siamese, would you?  Sorry, totally OT, I know.
---
That was your ghouldaddy's WAR watch!

My wife says its a wonderful bonding experience but you'll lose your enthusiasm for it at 3am when the little one is screaming, your running on empty and your nips are sore.
---
Good luck. üòÇ
---
some people like anal.
---
You say that now, but week after week of terrible atom store items will break you.
---
I give it 2 months before you are screaming at the top of your lungs yelling 'WTF guys!'
---
Your next post on this subreddit will be "Hey Bethesda, I will program your atom stuff for free"
---
Oof.. is that a legacy? Inquiring minds have had their interest piqued maybe
---
I tried that, but all it did was spawn me outside the cave sooooo ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, it's a pretty hard fight, I wouldn't recommend fighting it unless you have a really good weapon.
---
Thanks for all the responses, I have found it.
---
Nice find! Appalachia radio was getting stale. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs just for fun, it‚Äôs a random encounter walk along the road and you‚Äôll trigger more
---
I mean the proofs in the pudding. Nothing we can do but quit, suffer, or empty our wallets.
---
Too late... Bought it yesterday after finishing dailies without testing it.. can I use the ticket thing to get my atoms back and give the items back?
---
We‚Äôre talking about the NEW bundle.
---
I love your way of just asking for free stuff üòÇüòÇ
---
good. don't die. don't camp. a little bit of a challenge.
---
got it. looking forward to it.
---
You technically don‚Äôt find Madigan either. A while back, someone managed to shift the corpse and see the name on it - and it wasn‚Äôt him. However, I haven‚Äôt seen that replicated, so...
---
I've gotten Perfectly Preserved Pie twice from the Port-a-Diner in Watoga High School. It's the only one that I've ever gotten any from in the game, now that I think about it, both times the enemy was a bunch of Super Mutants, twice with Super Mutant nothing with any other enemy, I'm sure it's just coincidental, but who knows?
---
I hate so much that there is almost no flat ground buildable places in the game (especially none of the resource extractor spots) so part of the bunker os always floating or you put it too low and the ground sticks through, like you said.
---
Makes me wonder how broken all of the other pre fabs are... And the fence didn't even come with a gate...
---
Fine you all can have this. They can use me for increased budget space testing.
---
nice.
---
don't die
---
yea. you can have it. i run bloodied commando and traded for it as trade fodder, but i dont really care now haha. so its yours. got a croc backpack?
---
It‚Äôs not a hard boss. Just be aware that when you start taking burn damage to move fast before rocks fall on you and you die instantly. If you have one bloodied sneak guy killing all the wendigo spawns, it‚Äôs an easy boss. Just a giant ass bullet sponge.
---
That‚Äôs just standard game design. Dude isn‚Äôt spawned until he‚Äôs needed for the mission.
---
The price is a small one as long as we insure console is free of lag dropped frames server kicks and spinning into Oblivion above their lifeless body.    We are the few the proud we are PC. Tod speed and good luck you brave beta testers.
---
Kinetic Dynamo for sure and kinetic servos on the legs.

That moment when OP realizes *they* are the one playing 'wrong'.
---
Those other 4 people were furrowing their brows wondering why he wasn't getting in on the XP/screw farming with them. 
---
OP just sees a monster to shoot and isn't solely concerned with maximizing productivity. 
---
These are the 2 types of players. 
---
The 3rd type is still at their camp trying to figure out a method of stacking walls without a floor. ;p
---
I wonder sometimes if it breeds a disconnect from reality.   (1) The guy who walked up to the Secret Service, dropped into a shooting stance and pretend-drew a weapon.   Like not realizing these agents, if threatened, can kill you.   Dead.   Not a video game.   (2) When my husband was training ROTC students to shoot weapons, one of them didn't think the whole thing was real.   No real bullets, no real damage, etc.   "What's making the holes in the target?"  (No joke; verbatim quote.)  He had to inform them it was all quite real and the ramifications of that.   Maybe not only videogames, maybe movies, etc., involved in this oddness, but very odd disconnect from reality in both cases.   Since we're never the only ones who do or think anything, you know there are more out there like them.
---
Or maybe those of us who might be somewhat interested in PvP quickly realized that the game wasn't properly designed to make PvP enjoyable.  A good PvP system levels defense, damage, and health to make it a skilled battle that lasts for more than 5 minutes.  This also makes it a level playing field no matter what level you are in the game.  PvP in Fallout 76 lasts about 15 seconds because of the lack of leveling.
---
You can call that being soft if you want to, but when winning boils down to having duped OP legacy weapons (i.e. gatling explosive laser, etc.) bought off of ebay then you know that it's a broken system.
---
Two fingers is UK. You're obligated to also say 'jog on'.
---
In Australia the plain ol bird is just fine.
---
You wanna know a fact?
---
My luck is at like 30 so i usually just get it in a few tries lol
---
Bethesda acting sus lol
---
... Sarah Lynn?
---
It‚Äôs prize not price lol, it‚Äôs a random encounter and he never gives anything good. I got i ticket saying I won a new corvega that I‚Äôm still waiting on
---
Bring out the gimp
---
I have not one, but two TS FFR auto grenade launchers. I know explosives are powerful. But that‚Äôs not the discussion here.
---
Imagine all the fusion generators
---
It's still rng, yeah -))
---
When not in power armour, remove your armour and backpack (if you have one).  This will show you your weight without any armour weight reduction attributes.
---
My guess, like others, is that your legendary armour has one or more weight reduction attributes that is affecting your carry weight.
---
Makes sense. I was just hoping for some good RP opportunities. Join them on my evil character and fight them on my BoS character. Would be cool if we can have negative rep with both factions and they turn hostile towards my respective characters. Raiders could send death squads like the legion did.
---
Some how I've lost all the screws off wendigo I've looted, I have my original junk from before the event , data size of 3, I also died both before and after earl , perhaps lag and it never registered me looting them? Or its putting them directly in my stash as I have more there then I remember
---
Just to be clear do you still run like Dense on the chest (explosions one), or jetpack etc? Or is everything UL? 
---
I ran ultralight on my combat armor and now switched to SS. Haven't earned all my limb mods yet.  Was thinking of going tankier with dense chest, buttressed all, and UL limbs.
---
Need uber endgamer advice!
---
(edit I'm not a JP kid. Doesn't interest me.)
---
No croc backpack, but you are welcome to browse through my inventory and take anything that appeals. I do have a godlike JFFR lmg that I want to get rid of
---
The issue with bringing back the Order of Mysteries is that by the end we are basically the sole member of the faction, a full Mistress (albeit by proxy of everyone else being dead and using their credentials, but I think by the time we have saved Appalachia from the Scorched threat we've basically earned it), and bringing new leaders or directions would step on the toes of those of us who have loyally RPed as the Mistress through our entire time on 76.
---
Now, if we were rebuilding the faction, as the leader, with Cryptos being the quest dispenser, that would be something different. I'm 100% fully behind this.
---
But I didn't do basically everything there is to do in Appalachia dressed in a 60DR/60ER dress with a 44 Pistol and a fancy Chinese Sword just to have some old Seeker come back and pull runk.
---
However. I would kill for a **clean** Garb of Mystery (+ Eye of Ra) that I can wear armor underneath, and maybe a few interesting variations, on the Atomic Shop.
---
Agreed!
---
Lol! Norton antivirus in 2020...
---
I blame the electrical conduit on the roof
---
I have found you have to place them backwards, and you can place damn near anywhere
---
oh nah i mean like, do you have one as in would you like one haha. i have a spare croc backpack plan too. you can have that also.
---
My main burned out at level 76 (ironically) after building an Excavator and then going to repair my lever action... only to discover I had literally 2 screws left!
---
My heart sank. I simply didn't have it in me to go farming for them. The meager spots I'd found were always super looted and I was just done. 
---
So when I came back 2 months ago and rolled up an alt, I made a point to conserve and farm screws as much as possible. 
---
Then it happened. I discovered a legit treasure trove hidden in a building. I'm reluctant to reveal the location here for obvious reasons, suffice it to say the room contains;
---
12 typewriters
---
4 globes
---
4-6 fans
---
2 boxes of loose screws
---
1 Hot plate
---
When I dropped down into that treasure trove my jaw literally locked open and I think I squealed like a schoolgirl inside. 
---
I subsequently began farming 'the room' daily, making a few server hops during down times etc. 
---
So the other day, when I checked and saw that I'm now sitting on 1247 screws *after* building an Excavator AND an X-01 I legit felt like I'd won the lottery! 
---
I then went out and did something only the elite could do. I walked past a desk fan and didn't bother to grab it! Felt like lighting a fireplace with a $100 bill. ;p
---
Nortons trash, i remember it used to flag all sorts of shit back in the day, saying it was malicious even tho it wasn't
---
A sleeker iconoclast armor would be great. If not, Engineer outfit from 76 looks ok, too.
---
Nah, my max is way higher. My carry weight at the time was 95/max
---
Not rare at all, the plans to craft them are rare though. I sell them for 499 in my vendor or give them to people for free if they ask
---
We all find NW a bit hard to explain and possibly dangerous. 
---
Programming on security is correct.
---
I'll try this next time I play, thanks.
---
Do we even know if fictionalized China was ‚Äúevil‚Äù in Fallout? All we know is that they were fictionalized America‚Äôs enemy, but America is clearly a villain in this universe. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve seen enough about China, and given Fallout originally care out with the China war in the 90s.
---
It feels like the tension and hatred of China was more lax back then, at least anecdotally.
---
I could easily buy that Fallout‚Äôs China was equally bad if not better than their depiction of America as part of the commentary of the ludicrous and hypocritical red scare like Liberty Prime is.
---
There‚Äôs also scenes where simple stuff like unions and workers rights, protests etc are labeled COMMUNISM before being attacked to the backdrop of industrial mills people constantly died in from the conditions while they make people with power rich
---
If anything I‚Äôd say this series has been ideologically critical of American exceptionalism, capitalism and consumerism, and hasn‚Äôt really expanded too much on what communist cultures look like in their world.
---
For all we know red states could be a utopia if we ever get to see the damn things.
---
The way communism is depicted in Fallout reminds me of the enemies from Killzone. They look terrifying but it seems like this series is pushing toward a Starship Troopers kind of message.
---
Well shit. Got the plans for a couple thousand each. But your saying I can sell the outfits for 499 each?
---
Oh shucks üôà yeah I'll take the croc stuff if you are offering! I'm always the giver-away-er in game, this is awkward for me lol
---
How do you think that whole scene can be done over and over as each new players come in? He's probably in that other room talking to his agent about securing points on the backend for the next cycle before you guys head up the stairs.
---
Fallout going mainstream has really made the ‚Äúsubtlety‚Äù of the message really apparent
---
I don't mind lower level players on colossal. I give props for you deciding to be there! I revive anyone I see down. I had a lvl 25 dying over and over, probably revived him/her 15 times during the event. From what i've seen, more teamwork during the event since its so new. Everyone rezzing everyone. So just keep joining!
---
I would strongly recommend a gatling laser and power user 3 perk card to help you replenish your ammo. 1000 rounds per core and a great weapon to take out the wendigo spawns. Get your hands on a vampires one and you'll rarely die if you keep hitting them.
---
This game is at its best, when you are just out exploring. I had the opportunity to resume my BETA character recently, that was on a different login, and it's so refreshing to be exploring again. No daily grinding because the character/account hasn't progressed far enough. I'm really enjoying the game again.
---
all good. ill catch ya tomorrow when youre online with the plan and gat plasma. will message ya here when i can hop online and go from there.
---
They don't sell super fast, I just stick them in there incase someone wants them. They are a nice outfit. (I only put in 1 at a time to not piss people off seeing 40 armour pieces to have them be mainly outfits haha)
---
&gt; I spent all... all of my ammo save maybe 50 rounds on my sniper
---
That's your problem right there
---
&gt; I just don‚Äôt want even more political stuff
---
This a circlejerk shitpost right
---
I look forward to it ü§ì
---
Same
---
The corpse in that cage is 100% Madigen. Rose even mentions as such during the Wastelanders questline.
---
Which i too find disappointing really.
---
I also like that he says communism is dead in this universe like we don‚Äôt deadass invade a hidden communist bunker close to the white spring in the most recent MQ, or literally get attacked by communist rovers constantly.
---
I think the red shift are real, (the enemies in the bunker wear the clothes) and that the terminals under Mama Dolce‚Äôs point to them being interested in securing the missile silos like all the other factions.
---
Watch, I‚Äôll bet there‚Äôs gonna be a war update someday.
---
Lorewise it makes sense. Grafton and Charlseton both saw massive worker movements toward the big one, Poseidon had mass protests outside, the infiltrators were spreading flyers around and there was an active CCP cell under Mama Dolce's. It makes sense that WV had more home grown communist elements than other places we've seen in Fallout, especially given the war wasnt even that long ago so people are still alive who remember it.
---
I‚Äôm very interested in what China looks like now.
---
I sell them for the in game value about 110caps
---
Its a Bethesda Dev/ Server Admin.. whenever that happens it means your gameplay is being monitored
---
Just tried this, worked wonders.
---
Hell, even as an ideology the Followers of the Apocalypse and Responders being centered around free mutual aid makes them arguably anarcho-communist factions.
---
I tried it out. It increased my damage from 50 to 96, ofc, covert operative multiplies that number by 2.5 so it adds up. However, this isn't great for slow fire rate weapons, works best on stealth commando.
---
You can't it's not our for consoles yet. Few more days.
---
Norton Antivirus is not so good, in my opinion. Too many false alarms
---
You can't, it's been delayed on consoles
---
Yeah! I got a forest scout Zealots, ap refresh, breathe underwear for a steal. I have like three Zealots pieces, which seem useless if you ask on here, but scorched and SBs just tickle me and the secondary and tertiary effects are boss.
---
Y tho
---
It's a bad bug that's been around forever.  Some people say they've found it by creating new character after new character.....maybe like the fifth one it will take?   I tried it with an alt once.   It still didn't take.   I gave up.   One person theorized it was because the name in the challenge versus the name on the map are different:   Bogtown versus Bog Town.   Who knows.   Only thing known for sure is that THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED IT.
---
I think that a %dmg buff to weapons would be better than adding more cards. It‚Äôs the beauty of the unarmed that you need less cards to fully max it perkwise
---
I've been waiting for so long
---
I don't believe you complete it and get the rewards if you don't exit.
---
Fast travelling out seems to exit the quest.
---
My favourite oopsie jerk moment was a prudes camp who locked utterly fucking everything like a squirrel hiding his nuts, and I'd shelled out like 40+ caps in FT to see his mounted head plans, tire irons and hideously overpriced but very general outfit selection. 
---
This was pre last last patch, aaaaaand his house was the backwoods camper... 
---
I can only imagine his utter dismay as some mystery jerker has sir pouncalot'd through his imaginary window and cleaned out the burgeoning ammo machine.... Also leaving a bag of fertiliser and an insult note behind his L3 locked front door.
---
Not my finest moment. However, sometimes we all need to live a little crazy.
---
I thought I missed something.
---
&amp; that's why I think they will change it. Bring it inline with everything else
---
Thanks, I figured. I tried it a couple minutes ago. You keep your junk, and event rewards. Just don‚Äôt revive the notes and the exclusive event drops.
---
Today I had 500 extra space after dumping the vast majority of my scrap. I now have 50 extra space, all filled up with legendaries. That's after getting my daily 150 scrip. All in one day.
---
I've experienced it too, and I wasn't overencumbered.
---
Are you able to get them max level yet? Or was it just rippers that are stuck at 20?
---
My husband and I were successfully fighting one two nights ago aaaaand...server crash. First time in quite a while, too, so really bugged me. Plus it was my first encounter. 
---
The next night we saw another, and no problems- glad to help out any other players who show up, regardless of level or abilities. 
---
Keep at it! They‚Äôre ‚Äòfun‚Äô...
---
I've got my bucket ready...
---
Dude your a fucking idiot i dont even know why I'm even responding, in a way it makes me a fucking idiot. The whole premise of the game was PVP you fucking moron, how about you scroll up two post up and see the like 6 different places dude shows you. Obviously you only play Fallout, the game was clone of DayZ and Rust, Rust was a clone of DayZ, when people started getting there bases blown the fuck up bethesda nerfed PVP, obviously you havent been playing since eta cause you would know this, you do know none of the mechanics the currently exist too keep you safe did not exist at launch right? I'm not gonna give you information your dumb ass could easily fucking google, fuck people are stupid.
---
I'd be fine with it being an atom shop reskin for the brahmin pen, that would be hilarious enough to work.
---
Yes, replace those ammo and meds vendor, seriously who uses those?
---
Haha that's what I am! Make sure you have blocker on max level. If the wendigos do spot you, their hits wont kill you in 1. Just jump away from them and shoot with vats, when its clear, sneak again.
---
do you like this game?
---
how about some optimism, support and encouragement instead of constant bashing and whining.
---
Personally I am always optimistic re FO76. Tempered expectations but positive.
---
Yup. I remember a post were a guy was all pissy he didn't get loot form the Queen. He spent 2 whole fusion cores from his gattling laser haha
---
This guys attitude is much better, but weapon and build type are pretty important
---
No, the Free States should come back next as they were a major group responsible for a lot of what happened in Appalachia.  There is much more lore around them.
---
Order of Mysteries was a minor group centered around a personality, and when that personality died, so did the group.  The only lore you find about them is at the mansion and the scattered bodies of members taken out by the Raiders.
---
Oh, and the group wasn't taken out because of the betrayal.  It was taken out because the leaders weren't smart enough to halt missions and change protocols after the third agent died.  It took 13 deaths for them to realize that they were being betrayed from within.  It would be one thing if they had been all lured to one spot and then ambushed, but this happened over a period of time.
---
That being said, I wouldn't mind having stealth mission events around the order, where you have to complete it undetected.  But maybe have one of the settlers learn about the lore and move into the mansion (we already have this for responders and fire breathers).  Missions could be added to the computer at the mansion for assignment.
---
Y tho?
---
Sorry to say this but there‚Äôs no way your lmg was doing any decent damage against that thing. It takes a team of bloodied players to effectively take it down, and two shot only does 25% extra damage compared to bloodieds 100%, 50% and 20% all combined
---
Nah. QA told management that they had to pop out to the shops to get a pack of cigarettes and never returned.
---
Poor management left to take care of the studio on their own, tending to multiple bugs whilst managing two games to make ends meet.
---
Weapon damage \* (1 + all bonuses% added together)
---
So some theory crafting as an example. 
---
Crafted, unmodded, level 50 power fist. 58 base damage
---
15str (75%), iron fist 3 (20%), adrenal reaction (50%), glowing meat steak (10%)
---
ad the percent's together for a total of 155% increased damage, 147.9
---
Compared to previous damage values of 200.97.
---
The more damage bonuses you add the larger the discrepancy, but overall it is in line with other melee weapon nerfs, which are hit harder than guns because they have several very large modifiers (strength mainly), and lots of ways to add modifiers (food).
---
Just read elsewhere that you still get rewards.... So now not so sure. :/
---
You only just realised this?
---
Played the event 3 times today, on the first run I got the rug, on the second run I got the gas mask, and on the third run I got the heads plan. I will never have this good rng ever again.
---
Put mine on the wall and now I can't (Re)move it anymore
---
I started as a rifle build when I was low level because they were easier to come by, once I hit around level 80 I basically re did my whole build to a bloodied heavy gunner. Now I swap between heavy gunner and unarmed melee(easy since they‚Äôre both in strength), and today I picked up a really fun explosive shotgun so I put some perks into that and now I can run all three pretty easily because they‚Äôre all in the same category, swap a few perk cards and use three different play styles. So don‚Äôt worry about it too much, eventually you‚Äôll find a certain weapon that you love and make a build around that, then if you ever get bored just switch to something else.
---
I'm so happy this spot is getting nuked. Fissure prime has a combined total of what like 3 cobalt spawns
---
Ok I won't!
---
Spoiler he dies at the end
---
Damage doesn't need nerfing though
---
Imagine how much more people would play if the vendors had more caps and you could exchange more legendary items per day. It'd create a more healthy, competitive in game economy
---
üòÇü§£You serious? WHAT?!
---
They are testing it on pc &amp; if no major issues we should have it in the next couple of days
---
Why? Probably due to the quality of last patch. It must be easier to release on pc.
---
 Wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft &amp; Sony charge a fee??? Just my guess, no idea really.
---
It's on live. They implemented Contextual Ammo for the Colossal Problem event.
---
Loot the  wendigo spawn around the room, they drop you back alot of ammo
---
Happy birthday!!
---
At least you're gaurenteed a 3 star when the event ends
---
In addition, don't fast travel out to escape the mine, it will throw you out the event and you won't get the completion rewards
---
Also the community in this game is so awesome you‚Äôll find people to help you with anything you need. I frequently drop aid and weapons for low level players to get them started and I know tons of other players do the same thing so don‚Äôt hesitate to ask if you‚Äôre struggling
---
Are we able to have more than one? And thanks I didn‚Äôt know that either!
---
Not hard, it's basic MMORPG tactics : stay away from red zone on the floor, help your teammates,...
---
Implying console doesn't have constant bugs lmao
---
Microsoft and Sony do charge for patches
---
I just laughed so hard at this üòÇ
---
Great! in rdr2 or most almost any other game I or others ask for help, or say that we are new, than we are instantly shunned upon, kinda sucks, I'm glad everyone here is super awesome though!
---
Everyone has üòÇ
---
And by the sounds of whats going on, on PC, everyone will be waiting a bit longer too
---
Makes sense to bring it out on pc then, I guess less cost in case another hotfix is required.
---
You're asking people who cannot do an easy and simple event like radiation rumble.
---
To be fair it's not that complicated you literally fire at him until he's dead.
---
If patience isn't your bag, try buying a PC. 
---
Just think of all that sweet, sweet solitaire &amp; minesweeper you can play while waiting on loading screens.
---
I just tried it. If the timer runs out u just spawn in front of the mine... no junk lost. You also complete the event and get a legendary.
---
Its crazy how many screws u get... +100 per run.
---
For starters, it‚Äôs 4 o‚Äôs. Secondly it‚Äôs a lowercase r. And third, it‚Äôs inappropriate here anyway.
---
Listen. Dont ruin my milking dreams. I just want to frolic among the rad infested wastelands and have random strangers run up and milk me. To feel their bloodied drug addict hands gently caress my udders with happiness and excite my for my milk. With a strong grip they'd squeeze and pull on my udders until I started to moo as loud as I can and I'd fill their buckets with brahmin milk. A true dream would come true... Well until someone in power armor grabbed my udder and ripped it off but that's beside the point.
---
Nope unfortunately but 12 dps a second on sbq is amazing (and like 24 per second on her gross ass face)
---
Yo lmao why am i only realising they both came from bats
---
I actually love radiation rumble but no one ever turns ups anymore.. Great for XP. Then if ppl do show up no one gathers ore...
---
The trick is not to stop drinking, its learning to avoid the police better
---
Aw, happy birthday! And congratulations on the pie.
---
yeah i get that, and assumed, however the wayward is a pretty small area and loading him all the time wouldnt be much of an issue, but i think its pretty cool knowing one way or the other
---
No, still in event until you leave the mine, junk is kept.
---
To be fair it's not that complicated you literally kill low level mobs and collect ore until you have 100.
---
I mean... your characters are only level 150... no matter what the legendary perk system would be for the most part out of your range.
---
Even if they went by the original proposal from when they first announced the system where you got a perk point to redeem every 50 levels after level 50, you'd only have three points to work with.
---
Oh well... thanks anyway for the feedback.
---
&gt; I was always a little disappointed in the ending of that group's questline, as 32 kickass Femme fatales get betrayed and murdered because one person's jealously and anger at being passed over by her mother for a promotion. 
---
can you please spoiler tag this post title and/or content? not everyone completed this questline and you might just have ruined the ending of possibly the most awesome questline in this game.
---
It really depends on your build as far as weapons go, my heavy gunner build needed the gauss mini gun so I bought that first. You can‚Äôt go wrong with the SS armor tho, you can take a serious beating and be fine. Also the SS shielded Underarmor is amazing, the +4 endurance makes it so you can run forever and extra strength is always good.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you do, unless it‚Äôs Ella‚Äôs corpse you lift it from.
---
I almost forget the chemist backpack, I carry around so much aid and it makes it virtually weightless
---
I mean, prewar USA might not have been great, but holy shit it was in a better place than the rest of the world at that point.
---
I got a pc just don't have fallout lol

Morgantown has a ton of Mutfruit plants that turn into cobalt.

Hell yea there is the meat pile im looking for since wastelanders drops! FINALLY!
---
Much appreciate for you time to share that info!
---
U dont have to worry about the prime meat. There are events every 15min and the amount of meat u can trade for scrip every hour is limited.
---
Long story short u can get way more meat per hour then u need.
---
Sure does
---
Reduced carry weight cursed shovel is by far more useful then the cursed harpoon gun.
---
They're used for the event "It's a Trap" in the Mire, Bog and Ash Heap.
---
Are you on pc? Don't think any changes came out to consoles yet.
---
Never fails.  Got one, buy not the other.  Like bread with no butter..
---
And that's a bad thing... How?
---
This is a legit problem. Thankfully I move legendaries to my alt account for rolling at the purveyor with a level 50+ character and/or rolling armor with a level 2 character to get a god tier level 1 unyielding leveling armor.
---
You're acting as if they'd planned to release this event 100% perfectly.  They deliberately delayed the console release a few days because they didn't know if everything would go as planned with the pc release
---
They fixed the problem almost as quickly as people found it.  Stop treating every fucking mole hill like it's an insurpassable mountain.
---
Why fix all these bugs when we can nerf the damage? Godd Howard is a genius!
---
Xbox PS4 or pc?
---
Techically commie china is a present faction in the game with two secret bases with one still active having npc non feral ghouls and one you can talk with. Also liberaters are the first thing you see starting the game even if they were ordered to be produced by the enclave. Its one of the only real villain factions in the game. Hence why they are the villians stand in for cobra in the new season.
---
Reddit is not Bethesda customer support.
---
You have two options available to you.  Either contact customer support and ask for a refund on your atoms or contact customer support and report the problem so they can fix the mesh so it works properly.
---
Neither of those can be done by running to cry to reddit.
---
Been waiting on it too

Did you unlock the ghillie suit from nw? Or are you trying to apply a ghillie skin to a piece of armour?
---
I unlocked it from the NW
---
Upvote lol, but this bundle isn't really blatantly commie, other than the color of the posts... you couldn't tell. The rest of the communist stuff i won't buy. Idc if this is a game, that garbage has killed millions.
---
It should just be under outfits in the armour bench then
---
Are the enemies "up top" dropping stabilizing agents and do you have to hit the mine dead center or can you stretch out the radius to hit monogamy and the mole miners?
---
Maybe I have to quit the game and relaunch
---
Cause it‚Äôs not an option
---
Reddit is neither Bethesda customer support or the official forums.  Tagging a thread "Bug" does not make it a bug report.

Well have you ever heard of the 36 questions to grow a relationship with someone? Or grow more love between a couple? Check it out here:  [https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/36\_questions\_for\_increasing\_closeness](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/practice/36_questions_for_increasing_closeness)   
---
Basically we were going through all of the questions together as a group and it was really fun and wholesome lol. If you look at the questions you'll see they can be very personal or simple, or philosophical as well.
---
I pay up to 10c per script value for anything that I'll use for script.   I know some will pay up to 20c per script value (i.e. 3 star armour is worth 24 script, so that would be between 240c and 480c).  If you are charging 30c per star, then I would buy you out every day, if I wasn't on a PS4.
---
For legendary items with the right attributes I'm willing to pay quite a bit more.  But a lot of players over estimate the value of some items just because it's Bloodied or Junkies.  They don't understand that it's the other attributes, on top of the class, that makes it valuable or not.
---
Repair your weapons with scrap not repair kits. Also just ditch your broken weapon and take a new one from a downed enemy
---
This would explain a lot, thank you
---
I hope that includes Junkies.  Unless you are keeping those for yourself...

Oh, and other armour types are good depending on your build.  What you need to look for are combinations of AP refresh (Powered), Harder to Detect while Sneaking, and Chameleon.  I don't run Bloodied so I can get by without unyielding and will buy good armour (Scout, Combat) with the above aspects.

700 hours in Fallout 76 since Wastelanders (we're in a pandemic, okay?) and never once used the ammo vendor lol üòé
---
No I have not.. I'm quite new here. Can you point me in the right direction
---
Truth is... the game was rigged from the start
---
Well we can't say it's name here, I'll pm you
---
Still waiting on any sort of post or interview that says they intent to focus on pvp and raiding. If you bother to look at those links you mention, none of them are about that. They are just talking about how they were surpriced that people didn't like to pvp.  Not once did they say this game is meant to be, or focusing on pvp and raiding. You acting like a 10 year old pre-teen doesn't prove anything (although understandable behavior from console kiddie). All they have ever said is that the game is lightweight survival adventure game. Even the OP eventually realized and agreed on that. "You know perhaps you're right and I really just misunderstood a lot of the concepts. It would be cool at the very least to have NPC camps I can raid as part of a radiant quest system tied to the raiders. That would be a cool compromise." But i guess you are limited in your mental capacity to understand any of this.

Are you sure you unlocked it?

---
I know, but this was a pretty decent roll, it's almost considered a god roll for a .50 cal.
---
Might be people you've blocked? Idk it happens to me too
---
I'll stop using the tesla when other people start managing adds.
---
Yes.   It's near the entrance/exit door, from what I've read.   Haven't done it myself.   It's red.
---
Thanks, Nicholas.
---
Both Abbie and Raleigh Clay from Free States are missing, their corpses never to be found. Abby's prerecorded messages allude to her being dead, but there is no proof to her actually being dead.
---
Put on pacifist, other than workshops you‚Äôre not really in any danger. The whole aspect of other players was to have unpredictable interactions, much like an actual wasteland would be. Some people are nice, some aren‚Äôt, some help, others rob. That‚Äôs how it should be.
---
That website is useless. If it's not a B or J weapon, it'll just tell you there's "no demand" for the item.
---
Also it's no help at all if I want to know the going rate for rare plans or clothing outfits.
---
Its a magic LMG. And that can do that damage.
---
Thank you for the tip, I don't know how I missed the workbench repair.
---
Question. Do those still count as kills for your XP? Or are the players killed after your XP is already awarded?
---
The gaps there so the Liberators can get through.
---
I finally saw the eyebot pied piper with the rats the other day, I think it was one of the last ones I hadn't seen
---
Don't your turrets attack them when they attack your brahmin ?
---
Are you sure it is Players killing your Brahmin and not Mob's ?
---
You know Supermutants and other Mob's love to kill your Brahmin and just wreck your camp in general.
---
About 10% of the time I find my Brahim dead with a bunch of Super mutants or ghouls or those pesky mole rats dead around or near it
---
Once I found it dead with a dead scorch beast  ,my turrets payed for  their keep that day 
---
It was at a workshop  in the sw corner of the map , and i was trying an all hvy Laser defense,it worked fantastically
---
Never expected it to solo kill a Scorch beast to be honest .
---
I guess 20 Hvy laser Turrets are a good Defense /Offense
---
I get mobs attacking my brahmin but usually my missile or shotgun or hvy Laser turrets kill them before they can get to my brahmin or even close to my camp ,but sometimes they kill my brahmin before getting killed but usually not .
---
Don't worry.  I've played fallout for YEARS and spent the first week angry because I now had to keep finding new weapons after they break.
---
Until I made the same post, had the same answer and felt the same way that you do now.
---
Farcry 76 oh sorry wrong game
---
would you happen to know what to use for a soft orange/yellow?
---
I did check my list and I don‚Äôt see them in it. But maybe I guess. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something.
---
Just got the Colossus Heads and (after searching for them in my build menu and finding them in Floor Decor, not Mounted wall heads)  can confirm that these little guys are awesome.
---
Yeah, I recently made my first alt. It‚Äôs fun to have to scrounge for stuff again. My main is spoiled by a packed scrap box while my alt has to actually go find materials.
---
For Full HP? Dynamo, you ain‚Äôt regenerating AP while getting shot with Assembly,
---
Bethesda reading this thread: "Let's meet you all at the middle ground."
---
*Changes absolutely nothing so everyone is forced to test bugs.*
---
Bethesda: "We do good?"
---
That certainly sounds viable. I'd hold off on switching for now, though (unless you wanted to do so anyway) since I don't think that the current PTS builds are quite what Bethesda had in mind as far as overall damage is concerned. I think one of the CMs even said as much. So I expect a few more tweaks and fixes in new PTS builds before this goes live.
---
It just works
---
Probably did the bug that made him immortal except from melee.
---
I have found a way to work around it. Place a large painting on the wall, then place the board game over it. It works for me.
---
Why would someone use itt for this event? The Tesla is a very powerful, even OP PvP weapon, but it's cabbage in PvE. But yeah I agree with you.
---
Facts. Im a shotgun build and try to handle all adds in any event I'm in so you don't have too.
---
/u/ladydevann
---
Hate to break this to you but it's kinda your problem if your pc/console can't handle those. Get better hardware or even fine tune your settings and you don't have issues like this. I have 4 year old gaming pc and i have zero problems. Or are you saying that everyone else should change the way they are playing just to accommodate you?
---
Depending on what weapons you are using you could get ammo by using melee weapons on low level scorched they always have .38 shotgun shells or .45 and sometimes they have some better ammo but, use the melee so you don‚Äôt waste any extra ammo trying to get more because that would defeat the purpose. As soon as you can get the perk scrounger I think is what it is called you will get more ammo from things you loot. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help from people the community is very nice and will help when they can depending on what you play on.
---
What platform you on?
---
I can make them For u if you want?
---
It needs a rebalance for sure, but every change they make goes in the opposite direction. More serous pvp is pigeon holed to a pretty narrow setup, there‚Äôs not many options build wise for serious pvp. To be fair though, you don‚Äôt need all of that shit to kill 90% of people in this game. You‚Äôre more often getting killed by your build than someone else‚Äôs gear. The truth is that the vast majority of players just have no clue what they‚Äôre doing build wise. 
---
Plenty of us have fun messing with people while using ridiculous weapons, and it‚Äôs surprisingly successful. I watched someone under level 30 take out someone who was almost level 200 with nothing more than a western revolver. If you run up against a dedicated pvp build, you‚Äôre probably going to get rinsed. But most of the PVE guys are going to be a pretty even match for other casual players, because nobody has a clue what to do. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúwin‚Äù anyway, I die all the time, but it‚Äôs fun to play around.
---
Tagging.
---
He told me it was their last functioning osmosis kit.
---
I proceed to get it back from a raider who's small group needed it, thinking the needs of the many.
---
Ward then tells me they've only got a few dozen left.
---
Am i a monster now?
---
It's crap unless, you want to tag everything to get xp. In that case it's the best weapon in the game.
---
I mean, as it is it's a pretty good representation of the actual experience of playing through this first Legendary Run.  
---
You can always look at it (or rather the space on the wall of where it SHOULD BE) and be reminded of the sweet memories...
---
Data point 4 , died to the timer (didn't escape) kept all 15 screws I had , previous deaths were to rads or wendigo
---
I've got plenty of steel and points, it just sucks they were wasted.
---
Thanks for the offer though!
---
Damn! And they delayed it, supposedly to fix the bugs, and this is what we get?
---
It does and it can be awesome.
---
Don't get angry with me just because you don't know how.
---
No worries, do you use super duper?
---
Scrip not script...
---
1. If you're low level, Scorched Earth is not a good event for you. Nobody will pace themselves so that you can do enough damage, it's like a challenge to kill her as quick as possible. 
---
2. Encryptid. It is NOT an xp farm regardless of how some people try to play it. You must be a conduit, which you do by activating a pylon. This drains your health rapidly, be prepared with stimpaks. When three people are conduits, the imposter sheepsquach loses her shield and you can kill her. If everyone runs around shooting mobs and nobody is a pylon, event failed and thousands of caps lost for the event starter. 
---
3. Campfire Tales. The 'boss' here is stupidly low level, so I don't get why people are pissed about that. Still, everyone should just tap it lightly once. Gun bash it or use a crappy weapon. 
---
4. You didn't mention it, but Radiation Rumble. It's a fantastic event done properly. Put on a hazmat suit and collect ore, everyone else will probably be doing enough to clear up the mobs. Keep the turrets repaired. 
---
5. One Violent Night. People like to farm the event until the timer runs out. If they angry emote at you repairing the jukebox or playing an instrument, that's why. Again, just tap the boss.
---
Have fun in Appalachia. Don't let the frowny emotes put you off.
---
PS4
---
Depending on the platform, I'll make rain on this Bambi. Lol
---
Don't ditch them, scrap them. You'll learn mods for later; unless you're near weight limit then I guess ditch them.
---
This Is true but they prefer shoot to some Vault dwellers and not try to attack foundation, they are still Better than Blood Eagles
---
Ouch, Xbone here.
---
They die. Glowing enemies spawn later.
---
Oh ok thanks. I'll keep an eye out for scrounger.
---
Please stop playing. My PC can't handle more than 2 players on the server
---
Instigating is what you want on a rifleman, there are only some instances where sneak really works and you can take out the whole group.
---
Single enemies where stalker could be the better prefix are too rare.
---
Yes. Get adamantium skeleton because you're likely to blow yourself up.
---
Well It Is a funny event! But, in the pts, the first time It came out... It was really worse
---
Try checking the atomic shop see if it‚Äôs unlocked there.
---
Lay off the Skooma ;)
---
Here is my build. I am currently level 183 and I have just recently SOLO‚Äôd the new Colossal Problem Event, so now I am fully aware of the strength of the build. Have not tested a SOLO SBQ fight yet... and have not tested too much on PVP b/c most players who engage in PVP have stoOPid guns (legit or hacked I‚Äôm not sure). However, I have taken down a few unlucky visitors trying to take my workshops, but it is a challenge...

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1e195fb&amp;d=sb0pg2ph2pp2pr1pi2eu0c62cj1cr0ce0cd1ir2ii0ic0a71aa2a40am2ar0an0ao0a12la2l71lt2lu2&amp;w=p10po0pe0pq0cu2cf0ck0c52c72
---
Anyways, a few things to share about my gameplay:
---
- Main damage comes from Commando perk cards, sneak attacking, a Bloodied Handmade (prime or powerful automatic receiver), Nerd Rage, Bloody Mess,the Adrenal Mutation.  Max Tenderizer, Max Covert Operations when I REALLY need the extra damage. To do this with Covert Op. in Agility, I suggest replacing Action Boy/Girl with 1 slot and taking out Marathoner. Also I do not enjoy the VATS in f76, so I use ADS.
---
- Damage Resistance is exciting considering I have been using the Chinese Stealth armor, which I consider OP for not having unyielding stats. I plan to switch from Chinese Stealth armor to Secret Service, but it is quite the grind to get perfect gear... Dodgy, Evasive, Moving Target, Serendipity, and Nerd Rage give me a bunch of Damage Resistance. It is important to pay attention to your health and your situation as a bloodied stealth player, and to utilize Moving Target by running away like a coward (kidding, it‚Äôs called strategy and repositioning, to the haters). The icing on the cake would be the Scaly Skin Mutation (extra DR).
---
- High charisma simply because I love the low pricing of vendors, the better rewards I receive from events, and the extra dialogue options available. (Correct me if I am wrong about Charisma affecting event/group rewards)
---
- A few last tips... I recommend the Bird Bones Mutation which helps out the One slot of Sneak Perk card. (As the mutation increases sneak). Find a Bloodied Automatic ASAP, even if it is only a 1-star, the damage increase is incredible. I paid 800 caps for a 1-star Bloodied Handmade, which is cheap in my eyes. Get a Backpack ASAP for carry weight and get a backpack mod that suits you best, from the Pioneer Scouts. RadiCool Perk and Marsupial Mutation help with carry weight as well. 
---
I hope this helps, and I apologize for the biography but let me know if I made any errors or if you have any questions. Also, feel free to add input on the build, as I have just returned to f76 after Wastelanders dropped.
---
I had enough points to do 10x to get around 1000 ammo. 
---
It will last me awhile since it's a BE.
---
Just dont wanna buy a game i already got
---
Just to let you know to get the brotherhood bunker you will have to get to level 100 in season two
---
Experienced this yesterday when doing the first event, died with Earl - no going back for loot.  
---
Must find this spot RM1cah told.
---
I finally saw him last week, neatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
so, u havent got to the raduim mods yet ...
---
you'd be surprised how many straight up morons play them vidya games
---
Ammo Legendaries and Chems (some booze)
---
Hey man I can't get on rn but if your going to be on tomorrow at any time between 2pm-12pm us est. I can jump on and help you as I saw you said your on ps4.
---
You don't lose junk when you die during this quest, i would know i tried my bloodied melee build and died more than all the ads combined :(
---
Just to contribute to your convo - I've never blocked anyone on this game and see this too, so don't think it's that. Always wondered this myself.
---
It's the less expensive ammo to craft.
---
It‚Äôs part of the questline but before the vault raid
---
Hmmm.. well, that is a bit of a conundrum now, isn't it? 
---
I say buy a copy for all the systems. But you don't need my advice.
---
Oh so I just do their quests and receive it? 
---
I‚Äôve also heard about a 3* energy weapon you get if you convince ra-ra to come with you, if you know do you get that with a quest too or during the raid?
---
Damn. That sucks, contact Support? See if there's anything they can do?
---
I just started bout a month ago. And i collect Collectrons. I got the normal one, raider, and today the Comrade
---
I hear ya. If I come to your shop looking for weapons and all I find are non-legendary golf clubs I'm definitely pooping in your bed, even if I have to blow the door off the hinges to get there. That's just the way it has to be.
---
Now. To wait for Christmas
---
Jesus christ, and i thought it took me too long to get fully uny Set of ss armor and all 3 gauss weapons bloodied
---
It depends on the people who will join your instance.  Done 6 runs and only one fail. And that instance it was me, a lvl 150 and 2 under 50s.
---
It's during the raid if you side with the raiders and ra-ra likes you. If she doesn't like you you can't get it.
---
There's a gold bullion machine at crater????
---
This news is valuable to me. I've got about 80 treasury notes because every time I go to foundation there's atleast two pricks bashing away at a wall or a mail box with a hammer.
---
Its..triggering.
---
I don't get it. How hard is it to have a big underground boss fight without it being plagued with bugs? Is it really *this* difficult to program?
---
He just stands there and doesn't fly around (unlike the SBQ), and you only have to shoot at him - there are no other objectives (unlike the Imposter). And yet this boss fight has more bugs than those other two combined.
---
At least have the covered in some blood
---
Thank you for the information!
---
If I do the raid with foundation is there anything special I get like the 3* weapon?
---
FINALLY SOMEONE WITH THE GUTS TO HELP..
---
Yes, it's difficult... But that's not the point, they had plenty of time to fix this.
---
It will be under luck I don‚Äôt remember when you get it but it‚Äôs a good one to have
---
I saw a post earlier where an individual tried ghoul slayers and junkies. He had the best results with anti-armor if I remember correctly.
---
I'll admit, with Enforcer broken and not working with explosive shotguns, I haven't even needed Adamantium Skeleton. So I haven't even noticed, lol.
---
You son of a bitch.  
---
~~Maybe she reincarnated as Dorsey and finally got to be an architect~~
---
Since which update?  I've noticed I've been getting one shotted a lot easier since the recent patch last week.  
---
Also how did you test?  Sorry for questions just I rely on this perk a lot and would like some more info.
---
Settlers you get an outfit, same with raiders. I think the settlers one is a pair of overalls and a hat, raiders it's kinda a coat. Raiders also get you the gun if ra Ra likes you.
---
The amount of gold you get is the same for both factions, you have a decision to split ot keep it all. Split it for extra rep, keep it all for no rep.
---
To maximize rewards though, you'll come to a spot with the raiders and settlers where the quest "siding with..." pops up. Make sure you have both the Siding with Raiders, and Siding with Settlers, quests appear so you know you've gotten all the questing rewards. Once you have those 2 quests, just continue with whatever faction you actually want to do the raid with.
---
That one is good fun with some cringy drama attached, but good fun.
---
Another day older and deeper in debt...
---
It's not that hard on Live with all those magic guns people are using. On a PTS it was kinda hard with nerfed damage and without magic guns. It took almost 20 minutes to complete... and we had like 5 guys with laser legacy guns and even one with hacked gun (handmade with beam splitter).
---
So there‚Äôs nothing special with doing the raid with foundation but you get a 3* weapon if rara likes you and you get one outfit either way?
---
And thanks for the information, much appreciated!
---
I would go much further. Why we cannot buy these from gold bullion to build it in our camp/workshop.
---
What is the name of the gun? Can't remember if I got it.
---
yep was fun as hell
---
also- make sure you repair your weapons, i broke both my lever and my handmade from killing so many wendigos
---
When I tried to finish this quest I found out there was a vault 76 holo tape you get from the robot outside vault 76. If she‚Äôs telling you to keep following her journey you may be missing that one, it‚Äôs also not on the collections list as a needed holo tape.
---
You're right, your time is coming soon
---
Two questions. Are you on xbox and if you are, can I buy an I surge t and treasure hunter outfit from you?
---
The same fucking post again
---
The hardest thing about the event is not getting done over by the bugs.  But once they sort them it will be a ton of fun to do.
---
Slug Buster, she'll say something like there might be something in a room, and if she likes you she'll hop in and open the door for you. From what I remember, you can't miss the dialogue.
---
It's not a particularly amazing gun, Anti Armor, Vats Crit Damage, Less Weight Plasma Gun. I'm a rifle build and I hardly used it.
---
Either you are a child or you need to learn to let things go.
---
Oh I have that. I thought it was from an ally quest.
---
I am on xbox and I'll make you them for free. Not on atm though, GT is Zachy Chan13 just shoot me a message on xbox and I'll hit you up when I'm on
---
Speaking of junkies, how much management do you have to uphold to run that btw? 
---
I have a character I am leveling up for fun because I always enjoyed pistols in fallout (Yes i am aware that they are not nearly as viable in fallout 76 and rather lackluster..) and have a junkies/explosive 10mm laying around for that one, but no clue what to expect of the upkeep on staying drunk and stimmed up.
---
You know...., reading this post and being reminded that Enforcer is broken... I always aim for the head, I don‚Äôt know that I even need Enforcer anymore. I relied on it heavily when I was first building my shotgunner...emptying the clubhouse at Whitesprings and crippling 3-5 ghouls at a time. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I crippled an enemy aside from an occasional assaultron but I do that with a non-explosive Combat or Pump action anyway. I appreciate the read which led to me dissecting my build a little bit. Be safe out there
---
Even if you are taking the piss, its top of the class for you. Only the British and the well read have ever picked up on what HRH actually means haha. 
---
It's actually an Adventure Time reference to my favourite character.
---
That was my backup idea. Thanks for that!
---
YES why dont they do that!!?
---
Warm *pre-war butter
---
Not sure at all but I guess it's when the vendors are without power connection. You can still buy from them.
---
Enforcer worked for me, B/E combat shotgun used in every radiation rumble, but haven‚Äôt used it before wastelanders. May I ask is the effect more obvious before? I‚Äôm able to cripple every ghoul in 1-2 shot.
---
Guys in this context doesn't assume gender FFS...
---
Fast travel to Crevasse Dam, turn right and  if he's not on the road in front of you turn around jump onto one of the containers on the back of the truck and use a gun scope to scan the top of the cliff to the west.if you have no joy just server hop and try again.
---
Another good spot is The Burrows South ,From the fast travel point turn around jog up the road to a sign that says Shenandoah st and he's often waiting for you directly ahead. 
---
keep a lookout for the corpse that carries the Skiing outfit plans at both these locations..
---
I also always check the spawn point at Charlston Station as soon as you arrive at the fast travel point use your gun scope to the left of the big tree next to you, you're looking for a tree stump in the distance and hopefully the lemonade stand to the left of it.
---
Hope this helps, Happy hunting.
---
awesome. thank you so much
---
*pre-war butter
---
The handful of times I‚Äôve run into him, he seems ghoulier than the rest of em. Lol. GL man... me running into him is in adventure mode on Xbox though. Not sure if he‚Äôs exactly the same Colossus on PC in the event
---
If you use the Bethesda Launcher check for an update. Mine said the same thing for Adventure mode and it worked fine after.
---
I agree there needs to be something after you're maxed out but something different would be good
---
&gt; 127 / 288
---
If you're a hoarder i don't wanna know what I am.
---
Was there an official response yet?
---
Yep, nothing special. An outfit either way plus a bonus gun if you do it with the raiders and ra-ra likes you. 
---
I think the only difference that it makes is some dialogue, Meg with the raiders will say she can't believe they pulled the raid off, and I think some raiders will mention it when you walk by. I'm assuming the settlers acknowledge it too.
---
Whoever you side with it doesn't matter really in the end, you can still get reputation for both factions and unlock all their plans.
---
Just again, make sure you do the quests for both factions until you reach the "siding with the settlers" and "siding with the raiders" quests.
---
It‚Äôs apparently been this way since the patch after the ban wave, but I hadn‚Äôt put it together until recently. We played around with it in pve and pvp. It used to keep you from getting crippled limbs in pvp, but now my arms break and I‚Äôm unable to continue shooting back until I use a stimpak. Same thing with the ghouls at white springs, they‚Äôll break limbs and you end up stuck in a stagger until you use a stimpak. I was able to make up for it by putting the strengthened mod on my limbs, but it‚Äôs annoying to have to move cards around constantly since they fuck something up every other week.
---
Riding shotgun guarantees a legendary blood eagle captain. He could spawn as 1-3 stars. I do that event multiple times a day and half of those has a 1 or 2 stars.
---
I'm using a Junkies auto tesla and I can clean up half a dozen or so wendigo spawns in a single clip, its more than just a tagging weapon. Same with encryptid, I absolutely destroy all the robots on the hillside with it. Its not a bad weapon in PvE with the right perks and assuming you use the auto version.
---
Ok good one xD
---
Yeah i cant
---
When i teleport away it doesnt show up on the map, so i cant rejoin
---
Servers are so unstable, got 2 freezes followed by server disconnects twice in the past hour.
---
I had a blue screen and then all my challenges were autocompleted
---
If you open a perk pack and get a duplicate the game eats it. People are pre planning on scrapping old unwanted cards and using perk pack to get more cards back since they won‚Äôt have as many duplicates after scrapping. It‚Äôs basically saving to get as many legendary perk point as possible with the current system.
---
I had that one on my first run, just need the plushie to get all that i want from that event drop wise. 
---
The helmet looks really good with the blue ridge outfit and the insurgent outfit actually. But yes, it could use its own outfit, agreed.
---
Did you not get the credit for nuking monongah either? I nuked mine but then crashed
---
I was really looking forward to this event
---
And dont get me wrong, its really fun
---
If you dont die....
---
I don't, I use the Xbox store. I ended up uninstalling + reinstalling and that worked.
---
Blue ridge caravan and insurgent both work quite well.
---
Ya they were surprised no one liked pvp after they made a game based on pvp, since than they have been rolling back all the pvp features, fuck your dumb.
---
It does and its functional.
---
Now?  It was comical a year ago.  Now it's just disgraceful.
---
What a dick head lol
---
Thanks, looks like I'm going to have to add the strengthened mod too.  It's amazing how much breaks each patch.
---
*Uninstalls* Nope. I am done after seeing that.
---
But some do. The suicide ones.
---
Interesting. 
---
I went to one on the map yesterday and there was nothing there. 
---
Could it be camps that are using the exploit where they build under the surface of the world?
---
Might just be someone who left the game and it has glitched somehow.
---
I only have that happen when using the double walls for wallpaper..
---
But it won‚Äôt even let me fast travel there. And yesterday I went to where one should be and nothing was there. 
---
Maybe it‚Äôs someone who blocked me for some reason?
---
If its the post I'm thinking of that guy was also saying he used an aa gattling laser. Since aa is still not working properly on energy weapons, and a heavy gunner should be using stabilzed anyway (giving diminishing returns with an aa weapon). It makes me really question his premise
---
Oh It cannot be abandoned bog town :D It has to be Sugar Grove.
---
Specifically, the splash damage of the explosions used to trigger the crippling effect. This meant you could just carpet-bomb the ground without having to aim much (or indeed even cripple yourself if it exploded too close to you, hence the need for Adamantium Skeleton).
---
Last patch broke this, so now your shotgun pellets have to actually hit their legs (or whatever limb you want to cripple), the explosions won't just do it automatically for you anymore.
---
My guess it's the camps that couldn't be placed, but player stays on the server. I have tried to go to such camps couple of times, but never find them
---
It will be bugged, and instead of milk they get your gear.
---
That‚Äôs the post I‚Äôm thinking of. I‚Äôd go with ghouls slayers. Maybe furious
---
Ah. Now that makes sense. I think you could be right.
---
Good luck man, let me know what you find out.
---
thx for the information
---
Same though first time ever ps4
---
Does Bethesda realize thats ...people....ew....
---
Hey man, hose sell some junk that's worth it, if you're not to keen on spending time doing a scavenging run. They have the ballistic fiber bundles, screws, etc.
---
Basically explains why all the games they make are half arsed and broke to fuck
---
I already have both rank 3 traveling pharmacy, batteries included &amp; thruhiker lmao. That‚Äôs 9 slots taken up just from weight reduction üò¨
---
They didn't even bother to give a fanfare for the finale of the main quest so not surprised there's nothing for a seasonal event. Would be great to get something like a promotional message or holotape for the theme giving a big congrats for a serious grind.
---
Jokes on them I run around naked with only my udders and milk
---
Screws might be rare, but it can be earned very easily for unlimited amount with a creative crafting.
---
Loot 1 scrapped assaultron head. This item can be scrapped for silver, screw, circuitry.
---
Now with steel and assaultron scrap head you can craft an assaultron helmet. With super duper you can craft more. From assaultron helmet you can scrap a scrapped assaultron head. And you can continue the cycle as many times as you want.
---
Their response makes me think its likely not consentual.
---
The revolution will be purchased from Hot Topic
---
After 3 disconnect from 3 events I give it a few more days until I try again.
---
Nope. Help her or you can't complete the Wastelanders questline. This game doesn't really allow for any meaningful RP outside of some choices you will make during the quests.
---
At this point Bethesda could just pass the whole company to me. It aint worth the struggle
---
Was this a survival gun or something?
---
The Only reason I dont have like half of the achievements is because I transferred from bethesda launcher at around level 50 I wonder how many players are in the same boat.
---
Do you fail the event if you don't escape in time?
---
I can't imagine it's because of someone blocked you.
---
But now you are saying u can't fast travel to them. 
---
Could also be a new bug from the hotfix/update yesterday because I also encountered a few camps, some white some normal yellow, during some vendor hopping yesterday on several servers where I was not able to fast travel to the camps. A notification pops up saying : 'you can not fast travel to this point'. I never had this happen before.
---
Go stick your head in a pig.
---
i would love it, if there was an option to create radstorms.
---
similar to nukezones
---
i dont know what the benefit would be or the reasoning behind it but id like to see more radstorms
---
What, you mean they're both fictional?
---
Fuck i am just now realizing enforcer broke. I thought they nerfed something. I feel like ALL perks are having issues. I opened and closed the perk screen during a queen fight and my damage went from 11s to 47s. Something about them being active or something has to be going on.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Uhuh. It's real disappointing. It could be a great, much needed tool for the community but that's not what the site's devs want with the tool.
---
So yeah, like you said, pretty much useless.
---
Where is this map of random spawn spots?
---
Some of these are probably due to people buying bundles which included the game(s), when they were more interested in something else included in the bundle.
---
Also, the Steam summer sales often leads to an interesting phenomenon where people buy games that they never get around to playing.
---
I was in build mode adding pictures to my walls when I heard a Super Mutant talking. 
---
I never get attacked in this location by anything other than molerats.
---
So I rush out ready to defend only to see Chally!! Grahm came to my secluded cliffside house in the Savage Divide. 
---
I quickly bought some plans from him and took some pics, let him know I was eagerly awaiting Meat Week and watched as he walked away rambling constantly about types of meat. 
---
I had no clue he could randomly appear like that. I thought you could only find him on his dedicated route.
---
Ha ha, just trying to pump up the post.
---
Yeah, it was. It was dropping off of Blood Eagles for whatever reason.
---
If you mean survival mode, then no. This was a Nuclear Winter gun.
---
/thread
---
Yeah they don't happen enough and whenever you do catch them they're gone quite quick. But maybe the brotherhood could use it to terrorize the raiders and settlers into giving in to their demands.
---
thats a fair point, and one that this wouldnt capture!
---
Oh yeah, this was happening.
---
yeah, ive been guilty of that
---
but the amount of $ is eye watering when you look at their sales
---
People who give out supplies to new players
---
no, when wastelanders was introduced, bloodeagles where using laserrifles/pistols that where different (better) than the ones in the basegame
---
when killing them you had a chance that they dropped them
---
i dont know if they could be legendary but i used a non legendary one and while it still wasnt a op weapon imo it was performing better than legendary laser rifles i used before
---
(OP just named his gun, they where simply called "laser rifle")
---
Fan fiction for 500
---
steel is everywhere, to craft rail spikes üôÑ
---
Good idea, I will swap it over and give it a blast. 
---
Thanks
---
Yes, it's inside the core (with Meg).
---
You know, the raider who had the affair with Olivia used to be her next door neighbor as a child.  Her family turned him away when they started taking in other children after the bombs (apparently, taking girls only).
---
Seems to me like the Order was done in by its own sexist policies...
---
true, i really enjoy the atmosphere they are creating 
---
well anyways, im interested to see what the devs come up with üëçüèº
---
Ok? Still a shitty bug.
---
 Had tons of points and wanted to test my new gun.
---
No, you get spawned outside, so can't loot the bonus crate, but still get quest rewards etc.
---
I know right? XD
---
Spoiler: &gt;!On the PTS, fast travel to both locations is now free.!&lt;
---
Did it three times in a row. Was working fine, but did not die during the event so did not encounter the respawn issue.
---
They really should add more time (even 1 minute more) to the timer after event or just move the bonus reward box outside of the mine. If you are encumbered, you will have no chance of getting to the box, before the mine collapses and ports you outside.
---
You can get it from a quest on settlers side or you can reach a certain rep for them but it‚Äôll cost a good amount of bullion
---
You're kidding.   I thought everyone knew what HRH meant.  Well, okay, except those who can't identify England on a world map, etc.
---
My husband is 100 percent Scottish descent and quite the Anglophile.   There's alot I love about the UK as well.   It was so great to be able to go there a couple of times.
---
Should I ever get a flame-point Siamese, this is what I will name her.  :)
---
Yeah its been around for months and theres no reply from bethesda
---
I only did this once and managed to stay alive till the end but I have a question, a little out of topic. After you kill it you have to run to the exit. So my question is what happens if you die inside as you run? Will you lose all the junk like from normal death and/or the event reward? Or will you even be able to respawn close, because you talked about the respawn bug. This event is pretty difficult on its own, mostly because it's new and I have no idea what weapon is best for it and first time I just followed everyone xD
---
Sanjay is giving Melody Larkin the pipe daily and both will return soon.
---
Can I use this amazing picture for my psn background
---
is the bonus crate always in the same spot or is it spawned randomly in the room?
---
I sell unyielding anything for 250 a star and they sell regularly.  I sell 1-5 things per day mostly bloodied, unyielding, AA, quads and plans (weapons and mods NO heads).  When I was in the forest I had a lot less traffic than I do by Watoga.
---
Yeah pvp raiding seems like a bad idea. Radiant settler camp raids would be cool though.
---

---
Hey, mind sharing the build? I would love to have a melee/heavy build I could just switch between.
---
What about the Medical Supply machine? I looked in one once and it had cigarettes in it. For that authentic "50s" feel, I guess.
---
If you want anti-wendigo bonuses, your best bet is a  Tales From West Virginia Hills #1 magazine, and turning in a Queen of the Hunt wendugo sample.
---
I‚Äôve had no problems. This event can be hard for most ppl tho
---
It's in a room that is locked right by the entrance, but as you leave the mine collapses and the room becomes accessible when you run back past it on the way out.Always in same place.
---
This was my experience at first, but I soon began to realize that of the many dozens of locations I had left to explore, there would be nothing but junk, and maybe a note or holotape to collect.
---
That sense of exploration and unknown quickly became one of knowing exactly what to expect.  Exploring became nothing more than checking another location off a list for having been there.
---
F
---
Subjective.
---
The free states could be back because we don't find the body of Railegh Clay so maybe he Is still alive
---
Scenery wise, I think the mire is most interesting. I dont care about water, because I can just build the small water purifiers in the dirt. Even with just 2 or 3, I start racking them up in my inventory even with speed freak. One thing I always do though before moving camp, is visit my new build site on different servers to see if there are any enemy spawns. In lower level areas it doesn't matter much, but having mobs of high level enemies attack your camp everytime someone spawns at your camp can get old quick
---
But u/Daemoni73 is right; there was never really a talk about a focus on pvp before the game launched. Saying *The whole premise of the game was PVP* is a lie (while adding *you fucking moron* just shows the constraints of your arguments).  
---
From the upmost qouted EG article: "The developer has promised new quests, new events, a faction-based PvP system and, crucially, new vaults opening." See, PvP gets a mention after the launch with a vague promise among others and even that wasn't fulfilled. At least I haven't met any factions duking it out in the open...
---
You can do two the involving bringing mireluck meat I forgot where it was and the raiders area and you can get extra rep if you take pics of the foundation and give it to the raiders
---
Place your spawn INSIDE the big circle.
---
You can‚Äôt, Todd has your money now
---
I got two the first week or so after earning them. You're only supposed to get one.
---
You can tell the raider you're supposed to hunt down to join foundation and it gives you foundation rep.
---
You also have the picture daily from Davenport which you can decide who you want to get the rep from.
---
Well the raiders have two, for me personally I usually get retirement plan when I first login and if I play later the second shows up. Sadly the foundation only has lost equipment to do right now but if you want a little extra, you can go to the overseers house and do Photo Op for davenport, he asks you which org you wanna photograph and if you pick crater you can sell the pics to foundation and vise versa if you pick foundation. Its definitely a slow grind leveling them up with dailys!
---
Damn! If I knew this I wouldn't run like crazy and looted all damn wendigos. it's just nobody stayed and they kept spawning, wouldn't care much if they didn't stagger you every time -.- but thanks for the info! next time I'll try.
---
Where IS the rug in the cam menu? I cannot find it under floor decorations.
---
Think yourself lucky. 5 of my dailies and weeklies auto completed. 6500 score lost. It's fair to say I'm not happy.
---
And clean adds that can stagger/hit you. Plus they are a nice source of adrenaline so kill them all !
---
Uuuuuh. Fallout 4 opens with scenes of food riots and has terminal entries at the Ration Stockpile about soldiers picking out targets for fun before opening fire into unarmed civilian protestors. (Boston Massacre 2.0)
---
Mccarthyism was pushed to the point where there was basically no due process or privacy.
---
There was literal internment camps. (Japanese Internment Camps 2.0)
---
Basically every politician was corrupt.
---
Civilians were being drafted into a massively unpopular war. (Vietneam 2.0)
---
Anyone that tried to support worker rights or unionize was labeled a traitor and in the case of the Appalachian miners, murdered by army troops on behalf of corporate interests. (Blair Moutntain 2.0)
---
Any sort of environmental or safety regulations were being stripped if not already gone.
---
They literally nuked half of the world.
---
Hell, the closest remnants of the US government are the Enclave, i.e.: the fascists trying to commit genocide.
---
"Dystopia" is an understatement. The Fallout wiki literally has the US described as "effectively become a military junta."
---
 And frankly even if the rest of the world was bad... it was the US that destabilized and invaded Mexico. Europe fell apart trying to imitate the US' actions in Mexico. It was the US that destabilized and invaded Canada. It was the US refusing to barter their last shares of oil that started the Sino-American war. You are not immune to propaganda and the Prewar US had a lot of it.
---
oh that room, okay, cool.
---
Thank you for all the info.
---
I saw them around 300-500 caps, so I sold mine for 450 because I needed caps desperately and people bought them actively. Now I bought a plan to craft them and sell them cheaper, but still didn't get my plan worth back xD
---
Works fine on Xbox.
---
Did it twice, without magic guns in live, it wasnt really hard. Died a couple times tho. Just take care of the adds, keep out of poison/rumble areas, don't try to suck the boss' dick if you are not a melee character or you'll be feared.
---
I don't buy armor, so I'm looking mainly for outfits. I would love to find a vendor that has all outfits instead of armor xD I'm sure a lot of people who use SS armor will too :p
---
Dont know why you got downvoted, you‚Äôre absolutely right, there is a built-in conduit just above the turret window to the left of the door ONLY when its destroyed...
---
"It was the US refusing to barter their last shares of oil that started the Sino-American war."  
---
You wouldn't barter your last kidney just because no one else had one left.
---
Wait, you guys get to respawn?
---
I'm always stuck alive, but unable to move or do anything with the only option to respawn, which repeats this cycle.
---
My guess? Probably the same reason we are only shown atomic shop items in a few select screenshots before buying them. If you give people a chance to try them out without paying, then they know which ones are worth buying and which aren't instead of just taking the plunge and buying something that looks cool.
---
Now I don't have to feel bad for killing it every time I see it ;)
---
People still complain about this? This bug is around since  a long time ago.
---
I never knew that daily gave you a buff.
---
*DEMOCRACY IS NON NEGOTIABLE!*
---
Prepare to be saved.
---
Anything, really. Black, scratched and bloody are adjectives that come to mind.
---
It really really helps to have at least one tank with a vampiric heavy weapon. I am that person in our team &amp; it makes life a lot easier as I can herd control the wendigo spawns while they focus on Earle.
---
My first Earl fight last night.. didn't did in my PA but couldn't find Earl after dammit..Made for the exit but was OW and that is a long ass haul out of there with wendigos swarming me.. tunnel collapsed and server crashed when I got everything working again the only thing I found new in my inventory was the plans for the stuffed toy.. anyway 1 fight down , couple of hundred to go üëç
---
Trade for it
---
It's very girly, if you female, then cool...
---
Not really
---
Wish nukes spawned unique enemies.
---
I know that these aren't real fixes, BUT...
---
When having the respawn bug, you can travel to another location, which HAS to initiate a loading screen sequence for you to respawn. Most travels out of render distance do that. Why this works? No idea, ask Todd.
---
This won't allow you back into the mine however, as the entrance will be sealed for you(which is stupid, have they not fixes these bugs?). In order to counteract this, as well as the After-10-Minutes-Bug, you NEED to have a friend in there and then fast-travel to them. Your "instance-slot" will still be reserved and you can go to kick Earle's stinky butt again. Just try not to die again.
---
I died just when he went down (standing in the shaft = bad, yeah I learned) and respawned outside. Waited till the event timer finished and got my rewards - plushie plan, 3\* assaultron blade, quest completed. All I lost is probably a 1\* rolling pin from looting his corpse. And you keep all loot (screws) you picked up during the fight. 
---
Conclusion: seems to work as it should but we all know there is always a good chance in FO76 somethings bug out \*shrug\*
---
Why is the boss scared for a simple good suck?
---
Well one positive thing about this is I learned that Gladiator isn't doing me any good as long as I'm using a Mole Miner Gauntlet...
---
They do if you count the Wendigo Colossus.
---
I think that, like in Lode Baring(One of my favourite events btw), you simple get yeeted out of the mine. The price you pay is that you will NOT get the bonus loot.
---
My guess bring the number to.mear fo4 levels for first achievement since I think most people who actively played on the launcher and came over to steam would of made a new toon eventually.
---
&gt;  With the United States unwilling to export its own reserves of crude oil, China had become more aggressive in its negotiations.[26] This resulted in a declaration by the U.S. president on July 24, that the last known supply of petroleum would be used exclusively by and for the U.S., and that the U.S. would not even contemplate the selling or trading of any oil to foreign parties.
---
Nationalist arrogance. Plain and simple.
---
I was able to place it on top of the kill laugh love light and it showed up just behind the light but on top of the wallpaper... experiment with neons if you have any. Of course it shouldn't work this way but... if you wanna hang it, it kind of works?
---
The Communists had an Intelligence Base in Mama Dolce's and a Headquarters built at the back of the Whitespring. I'd be disappointed if they never came up again in the story because it would be such a missed opportunity. We have never had a chance to expand upon or explore the Resource War or the pre-war world of Fallout before. 
---
What more could we get from the other factions? As much as I love the Free States I doubt they had uniforms or strict design principals for things. They were just people making do with what they had. The Raiders are a disparate rabble, barely connected to each other and we've already had a lot of items for them and bundles. 
---
Now The Enclave on the other hand, we absolutely need a bundle for. Be it rewards through a season, story content, or as an Atom Store purchase it's always bothered me how we never got anything. Rich in lore and as nostalgic for me as the Brotherhood and Super Mutants it seems a no brainer to have something for them.
---
I used every bullet I had for my 5 different guns including 7 fusion cores and had to pick up a mole miners combat shotgun to continue instead of hiding In a corner. We won with 1s to spare i got his loot then i was teleported out without completing the objective or the event
---
Sure, it would be an honor! You can get the uncompressed version (and others) here: https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
And the SBQ. Also I think only in the SBQ event do some of the scortched versions of enemies spawn. But on that I am not sure
---
So they‚Äôre basically giving us the short end of the stick; while they swim in our money
---
AHH okay, then I'll be looting those wendigos right after killing them and run like hell to the exit as usual xD thanks!
---
The Colossus is just a creature/cryptid thus non of the slayer's prefixes boost against it. The generic prefixes would be Bloodied (up to +90%), Junkie's (+50%), Furious (+45%) or Anti-armor (+29%).
---
Try Bethesda support.
---
BUT IT DOES ALLOW FOR RP OUTSIDE OF QUESTS. DEATH TO CHINA, ENCLAVE BROTHER...member
---
I totally know the feeling. My first encounter with this creature - I shall not name for I am unworthy - was as exciting as scary. I will remember it for a long time. 
---
I was on a railroad bridge, not far from Charleston's Capitol building I guess, it was almost dawn. The sunlight was creating a nice atmosphere, as if the air was loaded with gold, and I saw him facing the other side of the bridge I was about to walk on. I slowly walked in his direction, my 10mm pistol in my hand. He was out of my league, maybe 9 or 10 more levels than me at that time, and I was not a sharp shooter. I decided to go for it : I put my pistol back in my inventory, and went for the baseball batt. This thick shadow seemed heavy and slow, I was confident in my capacity to stun him for a while with a big hit on his back. I ran. Right into battle. As I was running I began to hear the sounds of the creature, it was both thrilling and frightening, and he eventually turn around. His two red eyes. 
---
Oh this gaze I will remember it : as he turned around he did this horrible sound, and threw these soundwaves at me. I was unable to stand on my feet ! He got me ! It is the end of me ! Oh sweet mother of God it flew away ! 
---
As I recovered, I took my pistol back and crouched on the bridge, waiting. Scared. I was an easy target, tho he flew away and never came back. I swore next time I would avoid him, until I got stronger at least... Until we meet again !
---
Yeah that's a great idea. So it's more like catch if you haven't been online than unlimited turn in's
---
One problem with the Skyrim &amp; F4 overview mods disable achievements. Most people put their mods in before starting the game and run their play-through completely modded. Possibly leaving the vanilla run through for achievements for later.
---
Dear concerned customer: right now we are too busy nerfing the hell out of things, creating bullet spongy tanks, and creating the next round of bugs, once we are complete we will procede with with your request of upping fast travel prices as per your request and removing note exchangers, the new (and only) note exchanger will spawn at the end of radiation rumble, thank u for your patience
---
Oh yes, I've been wondering for a long time why some glowing enemies aren't... well glowing xD I thought it was a big, now I know there are no even textures? I am speechless
---
No they don't want you to make choices or pick sides you have to be friendly to everyone or you will be blocked from being friendly to.people you want. The justification for having to work with her is weak as shit as well as it honestly seems like you could of done the quest you need her for a other way. I would pay money to permanently remove her from my game.
---
That mask is really amazing, it reminds me of the dieselpunk armors I make:
---
[https://www.deviantart.com/zilochius/gallery](https://www.deviantart.com/zilochius/gallery)  
---
There are a lot of cool masks in the game but not a lot of cool armored outfits...
---
And they said they fixed it in the last patch. Clearly they didn't so still missing people off.
---
You may not like this, but it is perfectly reasonable to want to keep things you have especially when it's very finite.
---
never asked about prices I just asked for a bullion machine at the vault.
---
Y'all think there isn't any testing, for all we know there is, but the devs they're just too rushed and overworked(possibly badly managed and/or incompetent) to solve any of the issues reported by QA/players.
---
Yay this is great news! I was pretty sad about my powerfist being absolutely useless there. I'm glad to hear that they're still tweaking the readjustment!
---
I feel like if a stranger starts banging on my keypad door, demanding to be milked I've got two options: turn the laser turrets on or let him in and see where this goes. 
---
I guess what I'm saying is step into my office friendo.
---
This is just make believe now. 
---
I've spent 12 hours a day on for the past week and every time I pull up the map I glance at Atlas. 
---
It's always empty. Nobody ever goes there. 
---
Yet somehow...
---
Wow they are all so amazing how do you get these in such perfect angle ü§©
---
How do you break out of it? Like how you could on tranquility lane
---
Aa handmade will be hotter after the nerfening
---
You need to keep someone's mother alive to get the CSA for free during a speech check.
---
That‚Äôs the joke
---
just wait, there is a timer you can't see while everyone escapes, you get rewards after if you killed him, sit and enjoy the rads for a few minutes
---
It makes no sense for 79 to have a gold machine from a lore perspective, as the secret service are trying to get the gold back
---
Try verifying the game files and/or downclock your GPU/VRAM by 100MHz.
---
This guy
---
Just hire someone to build some farm plots for you.
---
but yet you‚Äôre still going to spend it. so there‚Äôs no point on not having it
---
Bethesda have even introduced a pallid Role Playing public team option that only has one path that of being a raider. As you have found, it is impossible not to help Rose and doing so compromise the moral efficacy of being a good person in this world.
---
Even my main cannot build dirt tiles for my second as it is like atom store items and not transferable across characters.
---
my instigating explosive minigun is out performing everything so far (bugged dmg), though my ffr vampire minigun keeps me alive better
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Maggie, but your father devolved into a flesh eating monster. Oh by the way, I also turned your Dad into a rug üôÉ.‚Äù
---
Im still pretty salty I probably scrapped a heap of those while grinding for the atom challenge for scrapping laser rifles :/
---
Sheeeeiiiit. Over the last 100+ levels or more I've opened the stupid perk packs even though I didn't need or want any new cards. Just to get rid of the additional click of "you have a new perk pack would you like to open it?". Shit balls. And the extra legendary run ones.
---
Those who at the end of the experiment have an active first subscription are handed the creation kit and are now the rulers of the wasteland.
---
Actually this happened to me just before my team killed him yesterday so i tested something.
---
I just stayed in the "alive" standimg dead Space to Respawn state i side the mine while they finished him off.
---
Once the killed him they trained wendigos leaving the mine, which killed me, porting me to just outside the mine entrance where i was dead from rads before loading in. 
---
I did get the rewards however.
---
Peak gaming experience.
---
Someone told me it was a bug that happens if a player leaves the server as you enter it and the camp is already gone but the icon is still there
---
Well not every soldier is an officer. Keen to see what they have in store for them though
---
I have no words but I do have an upvote for the laugh you just gave me.
---
There was a datamined outfit that had the mask a month or two back. I assume either the outfit and slightly different version of the mask go on sell in the atomic shop eventually or the outfit ends up a reward as well at some point.
---
I mean, I run into this problem in every game I play. It could be capture the flag in any FPS and people are more concerned about getting kills instead of capturing the flag.
---
Makes sense. It would explain why no camp is in that location when you go there.
---
Do not place it in a Red Rocket Garage: i'm not able to select it again to remove or reposition it :(
---
I'd urge you to uninstall Norton asap but historically, Norton software leaves a mess of registry entries and orphaned files behind. Also, it sucks udders.
---
I'd recommend either ESET products or Kaspersky. The former is more affordable and extremely capable.
---
Ranch every animal/monster in the game after taming them. Animal companions that get "injured" then you have to wait a cooldown to resummon.
---
So... like when the Prewar US invaded Mexico for oil?
---
Or when Prewar US invaded Canada for oil?
---
Even on your own terms, that's still a 1:2, disadvantage.
---
Yeah, I can‚Äôt understand how they make a sale. I‚Äôm sure they do, some people are bound to buy it. But what gets me is what if they make 2 quick sales and are now at cap max?? I guess my vendor is like the Bargain Hunt compared to those guys...
---
Damn. I've got the skin rug and the head but no gas mask plushie or cursed weapons. Can't wait to use up thousands of. 50 rounds lmaooo
---
Excellent, another fur suit to add to my collection. I just need a fursuit power armor. Fuzzy's Raiders will be dressed for all their degenerate actions in the wasteland!
---
It‚Äôs under lights
---
That's sooooo good than lol. Better than every other wall and the normal fences in the game
---
Gotta agree with you there
---
I'm kinda hoping they ease up on launch restriction timers as its gonna suck trying to find servers where they haven't launched 3 nukes efore you log in for people who want to try the new event.
---
Did you grind all the robot combat challenges?
---
Cursed weapons are raining on me, can't be that rare. I only miss the heads now. All in all, once I have all, I am not sure I will do the event much more. Too much ammo wasted.
---
I love the level of challenge. It's not hard for me since i'm in late endgame phase but it's at least challenging
---
No lies detected
---
I only really want 3 tbh and this isn't about me having the max. It's about all the points I used on respecs, the ability to continue respecing, and having multiple loadouts
---
Yeah, I got the same things, i was running around, and then my VATS showed me a van. I was like "dafuk... Oh, I see, another bug, noice"... It wasn't a bug :')
---
Yes, it's called fallout 4 ü§£
---
This guy! This guy gets it
---
So that makes the need for Enforcer obsolete if I don‚Äôt use explosive shotgun correct? I mean if I want to cripple something without enforcer equipped, I can still shoot the legs correct? Just wanna make sure I‚Äôm understanding the way the card works before I dump it
---
Happy Birthday!! ü•∞
---
I did this during the holiday event because the collectrons could collect presents.  Blue printed a little 2x2 platform with a collection in the middle, a stash box, and turrets around the edge that bike flop down at the nearest point to the fast travel point and just collected stuff for hours.
---
It would be awesome if we literally got a winter out of this event, with some new enemies based around that.
---
Yeah I can't get why they choose this way. The Scortched Earth event is really cool beacuse almost the whole server is there every time
---
Oddly enough Gibbs rule 34 applies here:
---
Rule 34: "Sometimes you're wrong."
---
Apparently it's a lot easier to get rid of the ghost budget on consoles.
---
Help
---
More responders/fire breathers pls
---
Yes and scrap boxes
---
The perk would be better if you didn't have to actually FIND a grenade first. I can't be bothered to loot anything in that mode I just afk
---
Yes, i know. If you know how to use perk cards and stack buffs you can do wipe out hoards. Even starting with a non legendary one. But using any tesla is good for tagging no matter the main effect if you want to get the xp. Thats what i was talking about.
---
Bro that's sick. That would look bad ass with the hunters longcoat
---
I did it 6 times on live. I don't use magic myself but during all fights I think atleast one person was with magic because sometimes you see health of boss drops for quarter in 2 seconds.
---
I still have a lvl5 one I'm keeping for new alts. I debated keeping a stack when they were still available in case they were sought after.
---
Everytime this stuff happens I keep thinking its just the net code they have reacts wayyyyyy different with the global sever releases then the pts. No idea how or why.
---
Look to the hills southwest of Fort Defiance, you'll find a little pond there. Great little setup. 
---
Also over by the monorail elevator there's a junk node if you're looking for a resource hub.
---
Wendigos
---
Trade for it.
---
Or start another character and go through the game again and use Private Worlds to transfer to your main.
---
I think it was supposed to be bigger than it turned out to be, like a way to actually see scorched on the map. At least that's what everything leads you up to thinking and then like most quests you finish it and nothing significant actually happens.
---
Are you suggesting that we use the public TEST server to test things?! Preposterous!
---
Is it mostly in cranberry or near davage divad
---
Thank you! A lot of dying, a lot of Stimpaks and a lot of practice. xD
---
And what about other manufacturers and their games? Do they show similar stats? Without being able to compare like for like its impossible to say if this is 'proof' especially as the Steam buying for FO76 is actually flawed as it also includes those moving across from the Bethesda Launcher who in all likelihood had no need to start afresh.
---
Thanks for clarification
---
I wonder if thats why so many games have lackluster endings. They put their effort into the part more people will play.
---
So tell me about the kind and wonderful Communist empire to the east, the one that shoulders the other half of the blame for leveling the planet. What do you know of them? Nothing save for snippets you learn from their spies. The US pioneered fusion tech to try to save the American dream, the US built Liberty Prime that saved the Capital Wasteland, and the US saved your character from the nuclear fires mailed direct from the Commies you're so quick to play devils advocate to.  
---
Without sin, no, but without virtue also no. Better to side with the devil you know. Also we get cooler power armor, cooler weapons, a much cooler flag, and cowboy hats(with the much cooler flag on them). :P  
---
Besides, at the end of the day, [we both know who won in the end.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zshYe6Agzk)

You will only receive one of the raider quests every 24 hours, but you can have both of them active at the same time. That way you can trigger one, then log off and save it for your next play session, then do both in one go. You can also trigger both in one session if you play before and after the quest reset time (currently 2am in Central Europe).
---
The settlers only have that one quest because Ward needs the attention. ;-)
---
Go to the robot at the overseers house, he wants you to take photos of either crate or foundation. Alternatively you can sell those pics to either side for rep
---
So they only offer one per day, rotating between the two. So if you didn't complete the mission the day before you will have a day where you can do both, otherwise if you complete every day it's only one or the other. 
---
Over at Ohio River Adventures there's a rep point as well for assisting in a mirelurk swarm. 
---
There's also a number of locations throughout the map that have repeatable spawn reputation points, like helping a raider kill something attacking them or giving them chems or bobby pins that will earn rep.
---
 There's a couple of posts and videos on all the potential locations for these as they're not always at the same spot, they rotate. Sometimes there's more than one available each Server sometimes they've all been completed at that moment and you have to wait but the good thing is there's no limit on these and you can keep server hopping and fast traveling to the points and earning rep over and over.
---
If you buy anything that you don't like, just put in a support ticket, explain what was wrong and that you want your atoms back and don't want the item. They'll eventually ask for the date of purchase and the atoms it costs (the support team can't be fucked to know) and you'll get a refund and get to keep the items. They want you to be happy and continue playing the game. That's their job, so you shouldn't have any trouble. Might be a delay though because of quarantine staff shortage.
---
Very disappointing rewards. Absolutely no reason for me to do that event. My nukes will continue to rain upon Queen.
---
I know it sounds crazy
---
I sell weapons for a particular price based on their set of perks. Most of the ones I sell are 3 stars. Explosive instantly bumps up the price because of how good of a perk it is and then increase the price more based on its otehr perks and applicability. I have a 3* hunters explosive combat rifle which would be good against the SBQ. I have put that up for about 6k?
---
I have three limb damage reduced weight deathclaw gauntlets with different primary perks ranging from 3500 to 4500.
---
Or a least the responder group being built over time with people joining after the person in flatwoods is maintaining a outpost there.
---
Tbh they should build off region specific factions instead of using old factions diversifying the regions we play in.
---
Shadowed + Ultra-light. 
---
For Muffled effect, you want to get from the perk instead. I forgot the name of it.
---
Almost got the same one. It‚Äôs a monster in Encryptid.
---
Does it prevent you from scrapping the last of a card or even maxed out ones?
---
That must of cost of a lot caps
---
When the bug respawns you the other side of the map you can‚Äôt rejoin the event as you left the event with the bug
---
AFAIK we don't have Abbie's body either. Maybe she finds the Order and latches onto it as a new purpose, since her entire family is dead and the PC(s) finished her AFAIK, Abbie is still MIA too.
---
No. Ward is a manipulative ex raider. When I become god emperor of the wastes, he's first in line for the guillotine.
---
:)
---
Vats still didnt got a fixed yet so .....
---
Mothman has noticed you. You must build many lamps to honor his benevolence.
---
(Seriously though I'm so glad to hear you're having fun! Continue to travel on foot instead of fast traveling and you'll find many more surprises await you in the wasteland.)
---
Make sure you also have a build planned out and follow along with it otherwise you could struggle late game :)
---
awesome thanks for that!
---
I mean if you remember, NW is years I'm the future, so perhaps this relates to what causes the firestorm
---
Happy Birthday!
---
I left a birthday pie for you on top of West Tek. :)
---
(That's a guaranteed spawn place if you need another one.)
---
The perk is escape artist. Thank you again
---
Yeah died in final seconds not only I was respawned outside I was near summersville no loot no event rewards nothing, very disappointing.
---
The fence doesn‚Äôt seem too bad, but the lack of flat ground in this game (unless you dgaf about building a house on a golf course) means I know I‚Äôd drive myself crazy trying to build one.
---
its really a shame that one of the "features" are those discounts. They made a system where we pay money, to pay even more money. Smh.
---
Oops apologies friend, failed to check if anyone had a similar thought before posting.
---
Jokes on you we already paid to test the game.
---
Buy enough bundles through the Atom shop lol
---
They were and still are and you should have saved them, the lvl 5 glitched lasers trade for as much as legacy weapons do.
---
Then the wasteland chugs along as they all leave the vault
---
More so fully fleshed our the concept lol
---
Do you have a disease?
---
Glow sight perk helps with the wendigo spawns. 60% + damage to glowing enemies.
---
Herd mentality and not in a group?
---
The fact that this has just been released, and a thread telling everyone not to buy it is getting traction, means I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll get a response soon!
---
The choice to make it an instance was great without the person limitations but their execution fucked them in the end, between the limits and the fast travel bug they've managed to make it unplayable for the particularly unlucky
---
Any reason why the spikes are so heavy, in comparisons to other ammo?
---
Oh that must be it, I just can‚Äôt see it in mu effects. Thanks!
---
Todd Howard don't ya call me cause I don't care,
---
you stole my time and enjoyment online.
---
I got a b1025 handmade yesterday for 4k. It definitely goes both ways lol
---
No offense to you ashbiz but can you please put a few paragraphs in there? It makes easier readier, thank you for taking your time to read this!
---
Isnt it only 8 players per instance? You could have been the 9th person and put into your own instance.
---
Yes this idea isn‚Äôt new but it is definitely worth repeating! 
---
When things are constantly being broken and things they say that are fixed, not fixed at all, and secret changes that we have to find out as a community on our own..it makes you wonder to the intent behind it all. 
---
It can‚Äôt be simple incompetence. I refuse to believe that.
---
excuse me for thinking it was the one displayed and highlighted lmao
---
Herd mentality doesn't appear in pipboy when you go alone
---
Yes because we don't find their bodies in the game so they can return.
---
Are you on console by chance?
---
Grow up kiddo!
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll keep that in mind.
---
Abbie deserves to know her plan worked.
---
No man, I'm on PC.
---
It‚Äôs only live on pc currently.
---
Drink away the pain my friend. It's okay. Just finish the bottle.
---
Ah yes because if She and Railegh escape they noticed that scorched stay in Apalacchia so they could return, maybe to refound harpes ferry
---
Ohio River Adventure
---
I was thinking for a while now that the better way of selling items would be for all the items to appear in the build menu and you just hit a button to spend your atoms since you are basically seeing how it looks by placing it into the world, there should just be a quick buy button. Atomic shops should be for sales on items only.
---
Thanks haven‚Äôt been down there for a while and forgot what it was called
---
Yeah. That's an issue with the garage and the meshing for the walls, the board insets a bit and the garage recesses as well so the end result is items inside the walls.
---
That's weird because the event has only a delay on console.
---
No no it should be me I can't have you all do this it is my cross to bare, and since I'm shouldering this burden I also volunteer to test each month what sort of feels a player gets from fallout 1st, I know, I know this is going to hurt but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
---
Well I had no idea that was even a thing. I never read the notes because I'm lazy, I did enter the moment the nuke dropped and the icon appeared but obviously not fast enough.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
&gt; kind of pay attention to the story
---
It's just not that simple. 
---
Without dedicating literal hours to reading terminal entries and listening to holotapes, you're just sort of left clueless. 
---
Anyone that has a limited time to play, is more concerned with actually running around and being active. 
---
Add to that the fact that the actual story bits are hidden among pages and pages of fluff. So only 1 of those 12 terminal entries actually pertains to the story, the rest is just ramblings or receipts or minutia. 
---
On my 2nd playthrough I *tried* to slow down and focus on the story but I just couldn't do it. I'd read page after page of fluff but ultimately want to move on before clicking on that single entry that mentions something like the system being used for such and such in a single paragraph. 
---
I play with headphones but I'm hard of hearing so I can't actually understand whats being said on the holotapes 9 times out of 10.
---
I ended up trying to just read it all online, but even that proved impossible as there isn't any easily readable synopsis.
---
I wouldn't say it's weird, there wasn't a single addition to Fallout 76 that was added for the first time and worked.
---
You're welcome.
---
I‚Äôd argue that there is a certain charm to the game being so glitchy and bringing the community together every patch note release to collectively be annoyed.
---
Though it isn‚Äôt like New Vegas, ‚ÄúNV is such a good game, and the bugs even enhance the experience because they‚Äôre either hilarious or we know Obsidian was under a short timeline for development.‚Äù rather ‚ÄúWelp, time to see what‚Äôs newly broke, and what features that we know and love have been ‚Äúpatched‚Äù.‚Äù I suppose it‚Äôs also keeping in mind the tight schedule that Obsidian was under versus Bethesda‚Äôs current timeline, ambitions, and overall the state in which the game shipped initially. Sort of a ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs come a long way.‚Äù
---
There has been a ton of research out there on scarcity. Their marketing people are not wrong. Just because you think you would spend more if the whole catalogue was always available doesn‚Äôt mean that holds true at a macro level.
---
They're trying to figure out how long it takes someone to rage quit a game üòÇü§£
---
Oh I'm not a fan of Prewar China either. Too much Tanky shit. It is possible to disagree with 2 different things at once.
---
Very interesting examples though. 
---
Fusion cells were an unintended byproduct of bloated military experiments
---
Liberty Prime was a waste of taxpayer money that was never actually deployed for the war. When he was deployed it was against the Enclave who are again: the remnants of the US government 
---
And of the Vaults that protected protagonists, only 76 didn't end miserably. Hell, given the amount of prewar ghouls in 4, 111 probably has a lower survival rate than just standing outside. 
---
A real interesting theme of the Fallout Wiki page for the US is how it keeps mentioning the use of jingoism, symbols and aesthetics for propaganda. Food for thought.
---
For me personally i see no reason to do it. The rewards are not interresting to me. If you kill Queen you get more flux and repair kits, while Earl gives twice the amount of treasure notes (if you happen to need them) and 2 flux. The special this event only cursed weapons and plans are meeeeh. I will buy them from player vendor in couple weeks.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic325u/colossal\_problem\_event\_rewards\_and\_datamined/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic325u/colossal_problem_event_rewards_and_datamined/)
---
Create a public team, even if you‚Äôre solo you‚Äôre considered ‚Äúin a group‚Äù and Herd Mentality will kick in, you‚Äôll see it on your Pip Boy.
---
Yeah, its 8 players per instance, 9 and 10 get screwed over lol
---
This is fixed a lot better than what it initially was, but that is the whole point of PTS and the staggered PC release. 
---
The more players doing an event, the more variables, the more issues found. 
---
It is impossible to play test every single potential variable prior to release, so that needs to stop being the bar of expectations. 
---
What we want to see is how quickly it can be fixed once going live and having the issues reported. At least they fixed the mission start causing game drop but there's still a number of heavy bugs that likely mean this isn't hitting consoles before next Tues at the earliest I'm assuming.
---
No worries I only just discovered it recently while looking for unchecked locations on map. I remembered it distinctly because I was ranting to my buddy at the time that there's all these cool locations but the game/quests only ever seen to send you to the same places.
---
You are misinterpreting the data. Any user who previously bought on beth launcher and transferred to  steam won‚Äôt get achievements the previously would have unlocked.
---
Happy birthday mate!
---
This is so lame. Should be able to support the max number of users a server can support.
---
So if you‚Äôre #9 and nobody else joins you‚Äôre supposed to solo it?
---
How can you compare clothing to buildings?
---
Yeah when I come across these camps with insane prices, and wasted my caps travelling, I then take everything from their unlocked collectron, water purifiers and anything else not locked down..... And surprisingly there's a lot of these people who don't lock their stuff.
---
I then make back more caps selling those items then I spent travelling to the camp, so can't complain.
---
Yeah, I just took some radaway and got rid of it, Im just trying to farm some mutations that I want.
---
The game doesn't change or anything if you help her.  Just help her to get what you want and forget about it and pretend you didn't.  Since RP is just in your head you can make your experience whatever you want it to be.
---
Choices with decisions and consequences that actually affect the rest of your game play are difficult to implement in MORPG games.
---
Where is the pond exactly i cant find it
---
This is the likely explanation. People transferred over, get no achievements, have loaded new characters and run to level 2-3 before deleting for easy level up daily challenges.
---
Thank you for the suggestion
---
Ah yeah just thought of that  üòÇ i just wanna know what one is better but it‚Äôs a rather unfair comparison
---
Shadowed yes but ultralight doesn't make a difference
---
Yeah, if only we had a test server.
---
I've got nearing 1000 treasury notes and don't use flux, I like the idea of spring farming though. Now that I realise it is a fixed 8 player event I'll just not worry when the event is empty and try to harvest springs from the odd wendigo.
---
I think that‚Äôs where the divide is between this expeditionary force and Roger Maxson. The expeditionary force will probably want to use the Observatory to change the weather (winter ) to freeze out the remainder of the scorched so it doesn‚Äôt spread , but It will probably destroy the area a prevent the securing  of the local technology (missile silos ) , of course Maxson will want to control this technology so a schism happens , possibly even sending a second contingent to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù the rogue expeditionary force and he‚Äôll erase‚Äôs all records to prevent it from inspiring further dissension among his ranks , and that‚Äôs why we never hear about the event‚Äôs of 76 in other games , just a theory though.
---
Thanks :)
---
Easy way to complete the ‚Äòlevel up‚Äô daily/weekly
---
Vats won‚Äôt count as aiming. The 50dr does not apply when using vats
---
I got told off for playing a banjo once at One Violent Night :(
---
Welcome to The Brass Lantern. Our drinks might not be that great but at least it doesn't have piss in it
---
Nice.
---
&gt;When will Bethesda give up? 
---
When everyone stops buying Atoms I'd guess, there must still be enough revenue to warrant continuing with development and running the servers.
---
I don't believe market research. Targeted advertising, for example, has not once, ever, advertised a product to me that was relevant to my searchers or YouTube viewing, or resulted in a purchase. They are bad at their jobs, in my opinion.
---
If there is any scientific research to support this, I would be very surprised.
---
Just like out of print music, books, or films, these are potential revenue sources that earn nothing. In the digital age, this is idiotic, as people resort to downloading the products for free.
---
The fact is that I have unspent Atoms and money because of this philosophy, and I'm not the only one. They are refusing money; that cannot be reasonably argued.
---
Be the faction then, make a camp covered in bloody meat piles and sell questionable items
---
I love how we just casually have a hide of 3 mutated , cannibalistic , conjoined human‚Äôs sitting on our floor as a rug. ü§£
---
Reddit 76 is not a bad game mode tbh, and it's free to play üòéüëç
---
Fear of missing out is what made me leave.
---
before you side one of the factions ro raid the vault you can do some quest with both that gives you exclusive items. Raiders gives you a unique plasma rifle (bugbuster) and a PA headpiece paint/skin for T-51 iirc, meanwhile settlers gives you a CSA set and a unique 10mm smg (old guard). You can get all four items before you join a side.
---
Just the opposite; junkie builds are all about suffering from withdrawl symptoms. So what you want to do is just chug like 20 units of bufftats until you get addicted, thirty beers, 25 psychotats, 20 daytrippers, etc. And then just let them wear off and continuously suffer the debuffs that come of untreated addiction to each of them. 
---
The real problem isn't constantly maintaining the habit; it's denying yourself the buffs that these substances provide. No more using whisky with Party Boy to gain +6 strength, for instance.
---
Maybe you need to aim better
---
Nobody but yourself can answer that. People can't tell you what **you** like more.
---
Bethesda Protip: if you remove the content, the bugs don't count
---
Whenever I encounter a mothman I don't even realise it till I'm like 5 meters away
---
Haha come on NW, let's see who can 'aim better' bud ;)
---
i also created bug report using beth customers support platform. this is just a repost to reddit mainly to warn other people to not reproduce described sequence as leading to progression, time and rewards loss.
---
Hmmmm, greedthesda dont care?
---
Im waiting till to do it later.
---
By joining the event.
---
Maybe switch to vanilla SS armor add shielded then put Cammo back on?
---
Make regular trips to the Abandoned Bog Town. The three-floor office building has fans, typewriters, and globes a'plenty. Then scoot across the street to the little police station for some handcuffs and such for a few more. Do this once or twice a day and you'll find yourself with a surplus of hundreds of screws in no time at all.
---
72 comments at this point, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard all the Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care comments... plz for the love of god just fix the fast travel bug. Plz! Beta player here, spent 100‚Äôs or $ on atom shop. Plz fix fast travel bug! Again.... Plz!!!!!!
---
Join the event and hope that your not the 9th person to do so
---
Same, happened in my last run: https://i.imgur.com/DWB6oEB.jpg
---
They drop screws.
---
I don‚Äôt know how much you love the clothes, but the bunker is neat. You have to use the advanced power connectors if you want to get a powerline into the bunker. But the sliding door is cool. I dig it. I just moved my camp down near the Welch‚Äòs train station and it now houses my vendors.
---
Agreed give us the loot or let us spend more time in the mine looting, say 5+ minutes? This also would help with dying as earl dies. Where you get warped out. So you either get the stuff or can go back in (or preferably not get kicked out at all) and loot everythin.
---
&gt;Lol, look at this asshole trying to actually play the game as intended and accomplish the clearly laid-out goals which the event provides. What a shithead.
---
I can dig it. You can get some chameleon armor and put on a marine wetsuit and tactical helmet and run it as a Proto Chinese stealth suit.
---
tbh, I raised my prices severly with all the PTS damage nerf chatter. As long as I do not know the impact (if it goes live at all), they'll remain high.  
---
But yeah, ammo and christmas gift plans should be 1 cap each.
---
Scorched. With COATS. Thank you for coming to my presentation.
---
Lazy Bethesda is lazy? 
---
But all the work making the event to give default looking rewards.. very odd.
---
I did get 4 Fusion Cores from a Wendigo that I killed, so maybe cores are included in the ammo drops.  I was using a Gatling Laser.
---
Hi my this scream Death korp of krieg sooo much.
---
I need one and a cursed shovel!!!
---
Maybe a Civil War or enclave uniform to top it of...
---
Herd mentality is actually great now theres public teams. Join literally any team, and get +2 to all stats. +3 if you're using strange in numbers
---
2 different spheres of players looking at this from different perspectives. 
---
I'm so sick of never having a challenge. Always taking everything out with zero effort. I even switched to a throw away .38 just so I wouldn't have to keep repairing my main melee weapon as much, from all the level 1's it effortlessly takes out as I farm. 
---
I don't do the end game grind. I play the story missions and misc quests slowly. I participate in Scorched Earth for fun, not rewards. 
---
As such, 99% of the time I'm encountering zero challenge. Zero reason for wearing armor or maintaining powerful weapons. Oh sure, the occasional glowing Wendigo or Behemoth will spook me, but then I bring out the heavy firepower and make quick work of them too...
---
I don't want everything to be a bullet sponge. I just want a reason to be decked out in nice gear, a reason other than it being easier to farm an endgame event... with the goal being getting better gear so you can farm the same event easier... for better gear to...
---
So if this change means I can pop into Sugar grove at level 70 and still have a need for weapons and armor, I'm all for it!
---
I‚Äôm not trying to bash Beth here tho? I‚Äôm just saying they could be visually improved.
---
Thanks corrected, in my mind screws and springs go in the same part of my tool box.
---
I don't think any amount of military expenditure can be considered bloated when your being invaded.  
---
At the end of the day, I don't like communist China, they remind me of a horrible documentary I was shown when I was very small about the "Great Leap Forward" down to the uniforms in game.  
---
That along with the information at hand, I lay blame on them for the great war. In this situation we don't agree on that even if we agree on the facts leading up to, and around it.  
---
As for the Vaults, we can certainly agree that Vault Tec isn't just evil, they are cartoonishly evil, but we do have them to thank for every main series game of the franchise.  
---
And as for jingoism, which is mostly all just based off the (frankly kick ass) propaganda that the US had in WW1 and WW2, yeah sure, America loves war, it's our thing Daddy-o. For once we didn't have to shoot first.  
---
I'll die on this hill before I let the commies anywhere near it, I don't trust them, and never will.
---
Seedy shed is the same, I now have a load of display boards on the walls that I can't interact with, display on or remove.
---
Not even for the free scrip &amp; notes? Mine has been bugged for ever, I can complete it as soon as it starts.
---
Great, glad to hear it!
---
Steam achievement stats can't tell a shit about this. Plenty of people played this game before steam release with Bethesda launcher and I bet many still do. Also most games on steam doesn't give you achievements for things you've done before implementation. I'm don't want to defend Bethesda but steam achievement stats are imo really poor source in this case.
---
But I thought this event allows a maximum of 8 players, not that many (I only found this out today).
---
Yeah. I just want to get the rewards to put around camp and I'll be done with the event. Obviously I'll do it every now and then but the loss of ammo is annoying
---
Over weight can only respawn at vault bug?
---
So.......
---
Best experience? Trying to get my friend unblocked, needs 1 neutral and the 2 blocked. So my friend and I went through Appalachia trying to convince strangers to invite both of us. Best social experience ever, so many laughs
---
But the micro transactions are terrible.
---
Here are some things I do to make it work with the Junkie's Explosive minigun:
---
* Use the accelerated barrel
---
* Use all 9 Heavy Gunner perk points
---
* Use Tenderizor 3
---
* Use Stabilized 3 (this means use Power Armor)
---
* Use One Gun Army 3
---
* Use Bloody Mess 3
---
* Have 5 addictions (to get the 50% damage boost for Junkie's)
---
* Use Demolition Expert 5 (this doesn't seem absolutely necessary)
---
* If possible, try to crouch and stay out of [DANGER]
---
* Try to aim for one body part (a head, the torso, etc.)
---
Its also worth noting when they added achievements. Ive got a few games that when I bought and played them, there were no achievements. Achievements were later added, but not backdated.
---
So theres game I have played, with lots of hours, but no achievements
---
I've had the exact opposite effect using Last Laugh. Last few times I've been downed, the grenade either didn't go off (or bounced away where I couldn't see the explosion? And yes, I ensured I had a grenade equipped), or the players near me jumped away in time. And that later of the two examples? I had a NUKA GRENADE equipped, with larger blast radius, and the two enemies near me just weren't phased at all.
---
I just wanna see it work once, and it'll be worth it.
---
To be fair, the game is way better than this read it reflects. I have never seen so many people who seem to hate a game so much play it so much.
---
We do quite a bit of Stimpak farming and sometimes get donations of Stims too. :)
---
Oh god...the suspense is killing me....
---
I like that. A lot!
---
What a useless piece of food! 
---
This item is worthless, the joy resides in getting lucky after who knows how many attempts so if you wanna reply (i see you lurky lurky) that you can find it in some roof GTFO that's not the point
---
Happy birthday man
---
Totally agree especially with the Brotherhood Fatigues
---
I guess so, but I‚Äôve been playing 76 as a solo for almost all of my playtime.
---
Thanks man, I do all of those except one gun army and tenderiser. I'll give it a shot. What's the 3rd effect on the je minigun?
---
Yes, it's in the game and no, they don't count as 'collected' unless naturally procured in the world~
---
(I've completed Tumblers Today and Unstoppables so can confirm)
---
Such bravery from you men and women, I applaud you, but inevitably this responsibility shall fall to me as I am willing to take the risk upon myself for all of you.
---
Me too üòÄ
---
+1 Agility for mine
---
rn these are not working properly on consoles (i heard they patched on pc?) and are an outfit and not underarmor atm. idk if they‚Äôre different, but the upcoming bos event reward ‚Äústeel dawn fatigues‚Äù look like they may be similar and dear heck im hoping its an outfit
---
Also remember when you are turning in dailies to choose the option to donate rewards, you will get slightly more rep that way, and sell your photos to the opposite faction and donate reward as well, instead of bringing the photos back to Davenport.
---
Not really we all have an excess of perk cards so it makes sense to scrap perk cards to level legendary cards
---
If by "bats" you mean "Chinese Bioweapons Research Laboratory" for Corona, sure "bats"
---
So..... Why do you expect that it could work correctly now? :D
---
There‚Äôs multiple images
---
May I add that you have to teleport to the event, it won't allow any walk-ins. You can be in the area, at the mine, and it won't let you in.
---
A vault of gamers
---
I'll wait for the free one next season since the char i was eyeing this for is bos themed, and i dont expect them to fix it soon, afaik it still rains in the greenhouse dome :/
---
"Maybe you should've followed your own advice and put up some turrets."
---
I did realize the Responders had the nuke codes.
---
lol You got excavator PA? Perks that reduce weight of items? It becomes a chore, where you can do it on your way to quests.
---
Ok Ill give you some more details. I legit only keep Traveling merchant to reduce chem weight cuz Id weight 1300-1400 without them, I keep no chem in my inventory to save space and know when to stop. I farm water but not to sell but to dilute Rad-x and Rad-away. They weight the same, but 2 diluted version is more caps than 1 regular, and chemist perk I get 4 diluted out of 1. And if im lucky with super duper perk, sometime I get 8! I collect any and all chems (many doesnt worth diluting including sitms). I collect every decent junk, scrap, bulk and sell, or sell them cheap in my camp (I keep junks either at 50/100/or 150 of any type depending on what i deem necessary, plastic might come in short, so sell items without scrap till you get 100s plastic. I sell every plan or useful thing dirt cheap too. I even dropped food and junk weight reduction perks. Only feed locally lol or carry 2-4 food or drink on me. Sell all the food especially the ones that can spoil. Over time, you get to a point where you keep the chems you get is enough to craft diluted version of them to sell over 1000+ caps.
---
Im getting that vibe do and I love it
---
Because someone posted on another site it had been fixed
---
Yes, they do.
---
I second that. They cry about everything. I get this game has continuous bugs/glitches. And half are unpleasant. Some make it fun. All those people need to do is not jump back on this game, and their problems are solved. Lol.
---
Pretty sure it only relates to missile launchers, fatmans, etc
---
What? The power connection is embedded in the structure itself?
---
Well don't I feel like an idiot after selling my 3\* Bloodied Mingun for 4,5k yesterday. 
---
Immediately afer I rolled a 3\* Junkie's SMG with 2 Vats effect whick promptly disappeared from my inventory after I fast travelled away from the Rust Pick.
---
I sat in a sea of Wendigos killing them with 2 hits. Left and right half the guys in Power Armor died like flies. Chinese stealth suit FTW :D
---
Udderly obscene... Also teats, not udders. Udder you have just one, and quite empty and flat at that ü•õ
---
Perhaps you shouldn't lol without reading the articles.
---
The first paragraph of one of them says "To be out of stock is to lose a sale or, worse, to lose a sale to a competitor."
---
It may also help to have an understanding of what research is.
---
Neither of these are peer reviewed scientific articles, nor are either of these describing relevant scientific studies.
---
Neither of these articles relate to digital microtransactions, but they instead largely refer to physical goods. These are not equivalent.
---
happy birthday
---
Foodbuilds will have a blast now carrying a ton of stuff out of the mine
---
that helmet looks amazing
---
Can you tell me about this? I find it annoying, but it mostly just makes me ignore the Atomic shop. What made you leave?
---
I understand what research is. I also have my MBA where we studied this extensively. 
---
I know you think you know best, so I‚Äôm not going to argue there. This topic has been researched extensively and I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs effects first hand in my business.
---
I don't think so. Otherwise this sub would burn with posts of it haha
---
This is a bug since the first week's of the game...
---
Unstoppables 5 is definitely in the game. I‚Äôve been playing since the beta and just found this magazine last week at Camden Park by where the robot vendor hangs out.
---
What he said.
---
Yes, you can‚Äôt walk around in a metal suit that makes you a walking tank with a minigun drawn and walk around with nobody giving a shit in real life. You‚Äôd probably be shot at by military irl üòÜ
---
(It never use to work with nade launchers, fatman, rocket launchers.) But things change all the time on this game. It may be broken atm... Just gonna have to try it out bud.
---
test? you mean buy bugs?
---
Thanks for the tip about the ultracite veins - are they where normal ore veins are when the area isn't nuked? I was exploring the nuked area around the mine last night and really struggling to find enemies to get stabilising resources off, so having a semi-reliable way to make scorched spawn would be helpful.
---
Stay off the chems, kid~
---
I am under the impression that armour weight helps with sneak.
---
What sort of business do you witness profits from goods or services that are unavailable? I legitimately don't understand how anyone can make money from things that they aren't selling.
---
next time send the ‚Äúcool‚Äù ones friend requests and make a mental note of their tags.  I assume server crash or CTD will happen.  üòâüëç
---
is that a bug or a bug fix though, seems like a very specific thing that may have been changed intentionally
---
I mean it sorta is, if you stay out of the falling debri and other hazards.
---
Fighting it right at the drop in point seems to work best since usually you get "scared" into a solid wall.
---
yes but only one bundle is one the image. and it‚Äôs highlighted. like... how would anyone think he meant anything else
---
Oh you still play solo - I dont ever go and "do" anything with the teams I joined, or speak to them or anything like that.
---
You very much continue to play as you were before, but now with more XP, able to use inspirational (+15% XP), +3 to stats (herd), better mutations (strange in numbers), some free extra perks (whatever they're sharing) free caps/xp (when they complete a mission) and up to 9 "free" fast travel locations (player, their camp, their tent if 1st).
---
Also if they happen to be at the same event as you, you can loot any corpses they tagged, which is handy for things like Uranium Fever when you dont always get a tag on the legendary.
---
They cant build at your camp, or drag you into PVP.  There's not really a downside.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
I disagree with you on that count. Black Powder weapons can be some of the most devastating ranged weapons in the game of you‚Äôre going by damage per shot. Especially if you have the fireworks favourited. And molotovs can be awesome for the Line in the Sand event when someone puts their tent in the special place.
---
It‚Äôs in the game, I‚Äôve collected them all. No clue about the vendor bot method though
---
So thats why no one else wanted to join. I tanked that guy for 20 minutes not realizing why the other lvl200+s wont join.
---
You were most likely in a public group with someone who launched a nuke. You didnt loss any rewards or anything.
---
Each of the Cryptids are amazing to look at and fight. Getting the silly quest to take on a wendigo when walking near the costume shop or walking around Charleston to find a Grafton monster who just so happens to be close to the nuclear power plant. My favorite encounter was walking north on the west side of the map and finding the Mothman just walking back and forth on the road. He had purple eyes which means he's peaceful. I snapped a picture of him and moved along because at the time I didn't know he would never attack so I got out of there before he did. 
---
Another time for me was meeting the snallygaster for the first time. I saw it in the trailer and wonder what it was but upon my meeting I panicked. This thing was a couple levels higher than me under the bridge by Charleston capital building and the fight was a bit long with ghouls joining the fray. If you get a chance check them out after killing them they have so many eyes it is gross and facinating all at the same time.
---
No no, there is no REAL power connection, but if you look at the preview images you can see a conduit over one of the fake windows. It isn't there when you purchase it, nothing "powered" about the bunker. If you destroy the bunker with a flamethrower or however you like, the "destroyed" model has the power connector.
---
This kinda implies the bunker was designed to be powered, hints that windows would possibly open. Design was changed, but the model apparently was never updated in either the preview images, or the destroyed version of the bunker, itself.
---
With the lack of any flat ground in this game, I‚Äôd say the option to snap a fence to foundations is kind of essential.
---
I‚Äôll bet you were playing on a public team when your teammate launched the nuke.
---
That's odd as fuck, since that's where the last two groups i was in stood and there was no rock fall and no one died that I saw.
---
Market data says you wouldn't even though you think you would.
---
When things are in abundance we have a "oh I will get that later" but never do mentality as something new and shiny was added and now you must have that instead.
---
But if it's limited time offer and with a small cherry  on top of being ever so slightly cheaper even though you really don't need it or can some times afford it you will buy it.
---
Marketing 101 l.
---
Don‚Äôt worry you didn‚Äôt miss nothing you can always drop a nuke and it‚Äôll still be the same as always
---
huh, that's actually possible, likely in fact but I must have missed the notification that I completed it. Actually now that I'm looking at it it's listed under completed quests in the pip boy. WTF this has to be a joke...
---
Nice. Where do you farm I'm running low on stimpak üòÖ
---
That's the one where you set off a Nuke right?
---
If it is I think it's because of the new public groups because I have never actually done the end game set of a nuke it was my only mission left to do then a couple of wks ago I was in an event group and they set off a nuke I obviously joined to kill the queen nice easy xp and much fun lol and I completed the mission. So I figured if your in a group that sets one off it completed it for you.
---
An absolute gamer moment
---
What is that
---
Cause raik road spikes are a 6" peice of Solid steal, weighs about 1/2 a pound.
---
They don‚Äôt have to be unavailable, it‚Äôs the perception of being unavailable allows you to accelerate sales and charge more. 
---
If you don‚Äôt understand, perhaps you should do some additional research. I gave you a starting place but am not going to spend my whole day sending you articles for you to just ignore because you don‚Äôt like what they say. Look at Apple for example, scarcity is how they are able the charge over $1000 for an iPhone and have huge lines at launch. They aren‚Äôt actually scarce, but they give that perception.
---
No it doesn't. I had to name my LMG "Saege".
---
Beth-etic....
---
The last thing Colonel/Lt/Major gutsies need is a damage buff on top of whatever armor piercing effect they have.
---
Their main ballistic gun continues to push my shit in if I'm unlucky enough to be reloading when they pop around the corner.
---
Dude, it's the literal tactic to let the boss live that long, people who kill the boss right at the start annoy me
---
Imagine how crappy this would have been, if the haven't postponed it.
---
I guess thats just the quality level we're supposed to get used to.
---
Alright, you really changed my mind. I just want to get done with my build after that I can spend my levels to inspirational and strange in numbers. Im lvl69 (hahhahaa it‚Äôs the sex number /S) I started as a stealth sniper and im trying to make a bloodied build(surprise surprise) because I recently got a great bloodied handmade. I just feel like I‚Äôve spent all of my lvls on the wrong things.
---
This. Log in. Join a building group. Or create one. Reap the benefits with no downside
---
If it makes you feel any better, you don't have to complete all of her quests.  I finished Wastelanders months ago and I still have the quests to gain Rose's trust (which I'll never complete because I ***fucking*** hate Rose).
---
Just mute the voices, skip through her quests, burn through the shit in 10 minutes and be done with it.
---
I think escape artist negates the weight of the armour so I can sneak in heavy combat armour the same as wood.
---
Ok. Don‚Äôt listen to the dickhead who was telling you your weapons are irrelevant. As long as you‚Äôre only dealing with one thing at a time, the black powder weapons can be the most devastating single shot weapons in the game. I know a guy who got one doing 30k damage with a single shot after all his buffs (drugs, Bloodied, perks etc.) But he is right to an extent. Shotguns are always complete and utter shit, at the range they work effectively at you may as well go melee. The single action revolver isn‚Äôt half bad for going round the Forest and killing things, you can use that in low level areas. Your hunting rifle is your best weapon unless you want to do a lot of damage in a short space of time. For that, at your level, your Molotov‚Äôs are excellent. They do AoE damage, meaning at the Line in the Sand event, you can throw Molotov‚Äôs at crowds of Scorched that will regularly spawn in front of the sonic generator (assuming someone glitched the event by using their survival tent.) This will tag most of them so when your legacy gayling plasma dude comes in and moss them all down in a tenth of a second, you‚Äôve already dealt damage to them meaning you get the XP and loot too,
---
In my opinion, the ultimate ranged PvE weapon is the handmade or the Fixer, both automatic weapons. If you have a Bloodied version of the handmade or fixer, and you run the commando cards, nerd rage, dodgy and serendipity and 19% health, it will destroy most things in its path with less than two shots. A free aim guy might like the handmade, but if you‚Äôre into VATS, go for the Fixer.
---
Yet never seem to have antibiotics or cure disease - for the times I do check....
---
To begin with, marketing doesn't work on everyone. 
---
The part that does for me, is a sale. The "limited time offer" is to put things on sale, so people who think they will buy it whenever, are compelled because it is on sale.
---
I think that's a better model.
---
The fact is, that between myself and my team members, we all have extra Atoms and have never bought Atoms, not because there are things we don't want, but because they are in the vault.
---
That's a marketing failure, and loss of revenue.
---
Compare it with a normal Pickaxe when you are at full health.
---
I sell them for 100 caps, and they really dont sell that good
---
Unless, he wants to raise awareness perhaps?
---
I used to run last laugh back when survival mode was a thing. That plus MIRV frag grenades was great fun. I'll have to swap it in sometime in NW, just sucks that NW uses your adventure mode SPECIAL because I'll have to swap out bloody mess to do it.
---
He shouldn‚Äôt have to use glitches as a workaround for something legit like this.
---
I am joining the event so I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm on my own
---
Isn‚Äôt steam achievements turned off when using MODS? Who doesn‚Äôt play fallout 4 with mods!
---
I‚Äôve joined the event when there was 5 participants, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs confusing me
---
Because I don't have time to sit around and level up a lvl 100+ toon for the challenges.  And starting a new game just for this purpose only takes 10 mins.
---
yeah but the are really optional and you don't miss out on anything without. If this would be Bethesda, than you would be limited to:
---
\-only posts with 30 characters
---
\-only 2 responses within 24 hours
---
\-only 30 posts or responses on your account. If limit is reached you will have to manually search your old ones and delete it
---
All due to server load. But if you are willing to pay 139 bucks a year you can have an upgrade to to double of all the above.
---
Get yourself a refund via Bethesda‚Äôs support tickets at help.bethesda.net - they have to give it to you. The item doesn‚Äôt work as intended.
---
30 million ballistic fiber, reward : 2 stimpacks and a tea receipt
---
Can‚Äôt get more delicious than that!
---
I think melee is almost impossible since every time you get near it sends you running
---
I disagree, because at night Nocturnal is the second strongest effect. Only Bloodied can outdo Nocturnal at night.
---
Bonus points for using the "Hi guys!" emote whenever you see someone.
---
This is exactly what happened to me, then I got a "cursed pickaxe", whatever that is.
---
&gt;implying that they actually care
---
Aww hell naw, let me get to level 50 first!
---
Alright if I put one together I‚Äôll send you the perk chart for it.
---
I picked up a bloodied one of my 1st run though of the new event 902 per hit just as it is I'm not normally melee build but I may adjust my perks to play with it for a bit I wonder what it can do after perking it out üòà
---
Appreciate it!
---
You kind of have to role play in your head a bit. Naturally most survivors hate living in a nuclear wasteland, I just happen to make the best of it.
---
Try joining public teams as soon as you load in. Gives you some free fast travel points, might save you a few caps. Don't forget Vault 76 as a free fast travel point as well.
---
Then stop downvoting everybody!
---
Dunno, it worked for me when I accidently drank some nukashine during the event.
---
I've not had the luxury of seeing this event yet, what's the deal for no PA players? If I teleport to the event do I land in a safe area?
---
Focus the wendigos until it does its roar, once you see your allies running go in for some quick hits then back out and refocus.
---
This is how I look at it. The 1400 daily vendor caps are a gimme. As in, just through playing I collect enough purified water, stims, chems, etc. to hit that cap easily each day. Those items don't really sell that well to other players because they're so prevalent. 
---
Serums on the other hand do sell well to other players. So I don't mind selling mine for cheap (compared to other players) 199 caps each because those are caps I can get above the vendor cap daily limit.
---
Highly doubt many ppl mod the game without trying it first. 
---
The achievements he mention take literally 5min. to obtain and everyone that actually plays has them.
---
It's not just the range. With a low health build, you can legitimately get 400 dmg per shot as an automatic, and it has an unlimited magazine.
---
1500+ hours in and both the mothman and Flatwoods monster make me scream when they sneak-attack. I'm never ready
---
Thanks all!
---
I'm not a fan of free states but I adore Abby. I definitely want her back.
---
Lol. Why put in the effort when they can just use the most boring and shoehorned old assets to build the next 6 months of updates around.
---
Loved the Order and the associated quests but lets be real here. I wouldn't be surprised if the next faction introduced was the bloody NCR at this point.
---
Considering how popular modding is I don‚Äôt doubt that a high number of players who bought SE just skipped a vanilla run altogether. Hell go i to any Skyrim forum and poll the people to see who actually plays vanilla.
---
My subreddit is r/SadisticMediaINC
---
They are so useless. Everything they release has issues at this point. Utter embarrassment.
---
And how exactly do they know what mods they want/need without playing vanilla at least 15min? /smh
---
Equip the Phama Farma perk in Luck and go looking in chem boxes at Morgantown Airport, AVR Medical Center, Fort Defiance etc.
---
My first reward from Earries body was a 1* executioners pitchfork.
---
It's been two years how is this (1* rewards from 3* boss mobs) not fixed?
---
Never used steam in my life. Not sure why people think it determines anything about anything when the majority of platform gamers never even attempt to use it
---
If you have the traveling merchant visit your camp they can sell you bulk ammo scrap for 350 caps.
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
As I understand it, it's not an easy plan to get...I was just surprised by how matter-of-fact they posted about creating alts and "...give them fixer and bear arm plans..."
---
That's not so easy as I understand unless you have a lot of extra plans from somewhere. Admittedly I don't get to play too often so I wouldn't be terribly sure of the drop rate...probably not high though.
---
Well, that sucks.
---
A lot of people usually watch videos these days to check out the mod scene before a game plus if you already played base Skyrim vanilla you‚Äôd be more likely to know what you want for mods on SE.
---
Sometimes I wont get any rewards from this event(happened 1-2 times already) and my worst reward is 1 star Ghoul slayer machete and nothing else.
---
I move a couple weekly (PC) at 150 &amp; 400 for the hat &amp; outfit respectively. Also have had similar (but slightly fewer) sales on the Treasure Hunter hat &amp; outfit. I only put one of each in the vendor at a time &amp; will craft for free if asked.
---
‚ÄúA lot of people‚Äù as in 0,01% of those 13 or 20mill. people
---
Stop spewing BS, mate
---
The Fighting Furries?
---
Hahaha angry dwellers go ‚ÄùI'm leaving!‚Äù
---
It doesn't mate, check out one of angry turtle's sneak videos on youtube
---
shush shush, that's my favorite spot, don't tell people!
---
I can confirm buying them at vendors doesn't count üò≠
---
Oh that's not actually half bad. I did like Fuzzy's Raiders but maybe I should branch out as we accept all fluffs, from the Fuzzy's to the Sheepsquatches, To the Chally suiters and beyond XD
---
You say it‚Äôs BS that people will watch videos of mods? Why even take that stance? There are plenty of channels based on modding Skyrim like MxR or just the modders themselves showcasing their stuff on their channels. These types of videos get millions of views.
---
can anybody tell me what is this miscellaneous quest i got after completing the event and leaving the mine?  
---
it says "pick up holotape" and marker was inside the mine until it disappeared after few minutes
---
Legendary perks are not released yet on the servers. You can check them out on the test server though.
---
Whaaat? I never noticed ammo on the wendingos... then again it‚Äôs a pretty hectic event and I wasn‚Äôt trying to loot. I‚Äôll have to keep an eye out!
---
There are times when I am looking at the pipboy and trying to figure out what to do with all my inventory, I m in power armor, and a scortch melees me!   The sound is so loud and I am thinking about managing my stuff and it scares the daylight out of me. Lol.
---
There are many jump scares sprinkled around as well. Love those.
---
Wow you‚Äôre thick. 
---
I am calling bullshit on you claiming that 200000 people (10% the OP mentioned don‚Äôt have the very first achievement of the game) is due all of those people modding the game BEFORE even trying it vanilla for 15min (which would have triggered the achievement)
---
At this point it seems obvious that Bethesda just doesn't care.
---
I didn‚Äôt say all.
---
yeah, but then they would have to pay someone to fix the bugs, but they would much rather swindle players out of their atoms
---
So you don‚Äôt even know what your own words mean. Ok, I think we‚Äôre done here
---
Ooooh communication issue. Okay, what about your armor? Do you have pieces that have Aid/Junk/Weapon weight reduction? Because your armor is unequipped in PA, those effects will stop working
---
üòä
---
can someone link to a tutorial on how to do this exactly? i so much want to close off my camp bedroom but hate the scrap wood look it gives.
---
Seems such an easy thing to do also, throw on the 'blood washed' skin over everything.
---
I fo know what my words mean you just misinterpreted what I said as ‚ÄúAll people without the achievement are modders‚Äù no I simply pointed out that the numbers are skewed on achievement rates vs buyer rates because of modding.
---
Why did you waste 40000 points and not stop after you saw the first procc in the upper left corner?
---
I‚Äôm actually really excited to try it once it comes to consoles.
---
Yeah, I used to be against duping but now I just don't care anymore. If you play legit you are at a massive disadvantage because you have to rely on a RNG that's set up to fuck the player over 99.99% of the time.
---
Ow... great. 
---
which pile? the pile of bugs or the pile of perks that don't work? both are getting bigger every day it seems.
---
sigh
---
No thanks
---
White means the owner is still loading into the world or just left. 
---
Try again after 2 minutes. Not everyone has the game installed on an SSD
---
Give it a little time, I don't think this new event will be that engaging long term, the limit of 8 players meaning even the nuke instigator will not have a guarantee of access to a full room will make  many people think twice about bothering.
---
At least with SBQ there is a guarantee of enjoying the event you started.
---
You can still launch a nuke. You didn‚Äôt miss anything.
---
As a chronic cheapskate, I have avoided fast travel when at all possible. Why would I waste perfectly good caps when I can find more scrap and ammo by walking?
---
Here's what you do to not only preserve you integrity, but add some nuance to your head canon. 
---
Your character helps her because he is suffering from extreme radiation sickness. The sickness twists his mind and makes him think she's on the up and up, or that you are merely a raider. The sickness comes and goes, a constant internal war raging within. When will you black out next? What will you do during it?
---
Eventually you'll find answers, and a cure for your blacking out phases, but not before you inadvertently gain the trust of one psychotic robot...
---
Then you can nuke Top of the World into oblivion. ;p
---
There is a holotape on a dresser or something in the starting area. Pick it up and listen to it.
---
Of course the first day of the event everyone is going to do the new thing. I expect it to be split over time.
---
you can turn on the dialog transcripts in your settings so you can 'read' the conversations (holotapes included).
---
On the other hand, if you fail to escape the mine after he went down and die, you'll be teleported to the entrance and don't lose any junk (at least that happened to me in my first attempt). So it might be best to stay in the mine as long as possible to loot all those screws
---
It was at the very top of floor decor for me.
---
I think people just need to cancel their fallout first accounts and refuses to use atoms for a month and start a mega thread about it on the forms. That would get Bethesda attention
---
Don‚Äôt forget fallout 1st, I have no idea about the exact statistics for purchases in this game but I‚Äôm convinced that there‚Äôs more people who purchase fallout 1st than people who directly buy atoms
---
You sir, are going places
---
Is that the horrifying long neck human centipede that barfs acid at you? I saw one of those bear Charleston and took it out with my trusty hunting rifle because I was NOT getting close to that monstrosity
---
That's when you stub your toe
---
So you want to come in as an outsider and have us provide you with fodder to shit all over the game we play, for your own view count? 
---
Right.
---
First off, happy birthday! But fuck yeah dude in all my hours of gameplay that is the only place I've ever gotten one. My boyfriend had entered the room and I made a joke about my crippling addiction to testing every one of these despite the fact it was the one time I likely would not have clicked it if he hadn't been there right at that moment and we both freaked the fuck out when we saw it lifting up for real. I just wish I had taken a picture right at that moment but I was too shocked.
---
Nah it‚Äôs nothing to do with proximity, just timing. As far as I can tell anyway.
---
You can really launch it and be kicked out the event you start? What the fuck?
---
Do people actually need hundreds of screws ? Been playing since beta and can‚Äôt think of a single time I needed 700 screws for anything
---
Okay thanks I'mma lvl up fast so I can get the perk
---
This game makes me feel dumb. What do you mean by using scrap? Like is there certain scrap used to repair guns? Anytime I tried to repair weapons I just got a prompt to use a repair kit.
---
Bugs aside, yes,  as long as you have a Gauss shotgun/BE Combat shotgun/JE Combat Shotgun
---
If bug is considered, hell yes, check the magic weapon guides.
---
Yea I sorta thought it but I was thinking of doing it with like less than 4 people or solo that‚Äôs why I thought was impossible since I‚Äôm used to doing events with a barley or no people joining
---
What? There are fancy weapons  from Pleasant Valley? And here i thought it was just western wear to dress up my camp allie with.
---
Outsider? I‚Äôve been playing since beta. And not to shit on it. I love the game. But everyone can agree it has problems. The more voices that speak out about them the more likely Bethesda will listen. I have like 50 subs and 4 watch on a regular basis. It has nothing to do with view count.
---
I was wondering about that too.... Anyone know the answer?
---
I got the bug for the first time today.
---
The only thing different was that I was actually playing during the reset. Typically I'm not online at that time.
---
It works fine for me
---
Why is this marked NSFW lmao
---
If it gets to consoles in the shape it‚Äôs in now, I play on Xbox, I won‚Äôt send a single nuke to Monongah Mine
---
A cursed pickaxe
---
If the guy who nuked joins late he might join an instance with 2 other players = no wendingo kill.
---
I'd do this on a private server but the daily challenges reset at 18:00 on my country, so I would waste it. If I could have it a whole day it would be glorious.
---
It's actually really easy.
---
- Pick a border between two foundations or floors where you want your interior wall/doorway to be. Make sure there are no decorations or stuff nearby obstructing placement.
---
- Place a brick doorway on one side of that border
---
- Now you can place another brick doorway right next to it, on the neighbouring floor tile. The brick wall sides will face each other and be hidden, meaning that on both sides you see the wallpaper back.
---
- If you want it to be a doorway you are done now. If it's supposed to be a solid wall you go into modify mode (on PC: tab), interact with one doorway, pick "Store/Scrap/replace" (R) and then replace (T) and pick a solid wall. Repeat for the other doorway to close the wall.
---
Ah, well, your intro certainly gives the impression you‚Äôve not played the game. 
---
And if no one is watching your channel, what‚Äôs the point of making the video?
---
Mines a mutants explosuve faster reload love it
---
We desperately need more enclave stuff.
---
I've kinda changed my RP to being an enclave who disguised as a raider because there's no enclave anything else and I hated not nagging my camp.
---
The apologists for this game crack me up.
---
"Why did you do that? Just craft them!"
---
Dude, it's still a bad, simple, obvious, easy to fix bug... 
---
It's pathetic.
---
Doesn‚Äôt account for other parts though, I played and completed fallout 4 on my housemates PS4. Later, I bought an Xbox and purchased the game, then also received the game as a gift which to this day, is still in the plastic wrap. There are. Tonne of anomalies that can‚Äôt really be accounted for without mass questionnaires. The fallout games are not a great indicator since they‚Äôre given with consoles etc. are downloads included? I didn‚Äôt pay for f76...
---
That‚Äôs weird. No idea. I‚Äôve done it a few times on PTS and just once on Live, it‚Äôs been a solid group *generally*. My first one on PTS only had me and one other dude though, that was rough, but as a bloodied HW dude I can solo it
---
That feels super broken.
---
Posting it here and hopefully having others here agree with what I say and spreading the word. I want nothing more than to see this game succeed. I live in the south so seeing one of my favorite games come close to home was amazing. Seeing it become successful and not buggy would be the best ya know?
---
Just so you know. Turrets are not needed. Collectrons keep working even if your workshop has been "taken". Enemies never seem to attack it on my experience.
---
so basically place two walls on the same spot, each facing a different direction? this works on consoles not just pc?
---
I finished the story and can't recall any conversion with MODUS about the scorched.
---
The idea to make it free on the PTS is good one but I believe even the live (production) one is PTS... so.. ?
---
God I want to fuck Jen from Fallout 76 so bad. I have searched the internet for any kind of rule34 about her, but to no avail. I want to grab her hips and start sucking on her fat fucking milkers while I pump her full of my seed while that loser Samuel is watching and make her a commie mommy with enough milk to feed the entire commune. Glory to the mainland.
---
I can jump 30 feet in the air but trip on a two inch twig while running , it just works
---
At least not for a few more days yet .)
---
No, you can't get kicked out. It just puts you in a new instance. So when it's full with 8 people the 9th will be out in a new instance. You won't get kicked out or anything. I actually like it as it provides more of a challenge. The event has run smooth for me so far. Did it multiple times yesterday
---
Thanks dude. Ps4 here so I haven't got a chance to check it out yet.
---
yes! not only next patch/update, **ALL OF THEM**.  
---
It is very clear to me that this BGS will never improve on their way of working. Every new content or fix is done half assed and I do not see it improving.  
---
The camp budget glitches are a clear example. They have all relied more or less on the same mechanism yet new items with the same problems keep getting released. I will not be suprised to see the next camp glitch working in the same manner as all the previous camp glitches. I'm even seeing a pattern you can form a conspiracy around: new atom shop items that can be used to increase budget -&gt; people spend their atoms -&gt; glitch is patched within a few days.
---
There‚Äôs weird issues with joining it that may affect your fight. It seems like once the fight actually starts, no one else can join- event vanishes from the map, rocks cover the entrance again. 
---
Dunno if that‚Äôs totally deliberate or just another bug
---
I‚Äôm a dickhead for telling a low level that black powder weapons are irrelevant after like level ten? I‚Äôm level 260 and I‚Äôve played since beta. I think I know what I‚Äôm talking about kiddo
---
No there aren‚Äôt. Alone there is Vault-Tec stuff more than communist.
---
Also half of the next legendary run will be USA based. There is no way, that there would be more communist stuff.
---
Ahhhhh. Smart
---
I hope this new quests coming out in September will be good, but  I have a bad foreboding that these quests are daily operations that they test in PTS, I don't know, just a doubt
---
In terms of dps. A stealth VATS headshot from a fixer does like 1400. A black powder headshot would do like 600. The difference is that a fixer can fire 20 rounds before the black powder rifle can fire a second
---
If you're powering the laptop off by holding the power button and your doing this multiple times I'm not surprised your OS is corrupted.  Try ctrl-alt-del to bring up task manager and close the game from there.
---
If your using windows 10 you can try resetting the machine which will factory reset windows.  Failing that a Windows 10 license can be had for a few bucks on eBay.
---
Also, it‚Äôs not 50%. 
---
It‚Äôs just 50dr.
---
Depending on your build, it‚Äôs kinda meaningless
---
I think we are all aware from the 10,000 posts yesterday that this is happening.
---
I have both in my mule, the laser rifle and the assault rifle.
---
Tip for anyone wondering, don‚Äôt die just before the boss is killed, you are unable to loot him if he dies before you can get back down the hole.
---
Yeah I miss the lvl up challenge regularly but not anymore üòÜ thanks
---
I'm on PC and I wont nuke it either, anymore.
---
I had to nuke it twice just to get the fucked quest finished. First time the FT-bug hit me 5 times, I was too late to the party. Second time I just keeled over and couldn't rejoin...
---
No guaranteed place on the team and the area does not give much for useful flux.
---
And the loot? Naaa, I'll stick with the SBQ, her shit is much more useful.
---
I didn't even know it was there until I got hit by its spit. I turned around, saw it, and wanted to get away while I killed it but eventually hit it with a legendary ski sword.
---
I might be the only one but I've had no problem on 3 nukes last night.
---
Well except that I'm screwed.
---
Give it a go
---
a revolver and a pump action shotgun
---
No worries man. It's a really fun event in my opinion. It's challenging and gives something new to do. Plus my rng has been great with it. Every time I've done it I've gotten a 3 star off the body and a 3 star for completing the event. Plus the new plans and cursed weapons are awesome. Good job Beth
---
Revolver and shotgun respectively. Low drop chance when turning in claim tickets, but with relly nice skins. Revolvers come as random 1* legendaries. Shotguns are always 3 starred, but with fixed effects and slightly better stats.
---
It looks like it may go well with the SS Armor.
---
I mean I already hate the silo enough, why go through and waste it on a busted ass event. But who‚Äôs to say that it won‚Äôt get fixed by the time it goes live for all of us. ü•±ü•±ü•±
---
HORF BORFDORF
---
Only on the PTS, but don't bother there. What you do on the PTS doesn't carry over onto the normal server.
---
It does.
---
Firework trail mine feature onto of faster reload speed i bet my harpoon gun out does dps on about anything my reloade is faster then the game will let me shoot:( I have a shot a second and deal 9000 damage a shot not sneaking cus thats slow and pointless
---
It's worse at encryptid.
---
Bitch fires laser but then nope.avi. Invisible wall raped me hard and I get laser 1hit rekt
---
That's the downside, you end up being number 9? Then you are on your own..
---
It's been doing the exact series of events you described to me for just under two weeks except always when I'm about to take on the SBQ
---
Yes, you can go to the Bethesda website and put in a support ticket.
---
My favourite encounter with a mothman was when I returned to my camp south of the whitesprings up on the cliffs. My turrets seemed to be randomly firing around but I couldn't find any enemies.
---
I went up to the 2nd floor, got into the bed and then heard the fluttering got out of the bed and right there behind me near the stairs up to the roof was a mothman...somehow he had transported inside my camp to the 2nd floor and was just fluttering around there. Had a great fight with him in the middle of my bedroom...got a nice pic of my bed covered in the dust and the wall covered in bullet holes and blood.
---
They‚Äôre not totally irrelevant if you want to take out something that has say 700 health. A black powder rifle easily hits that, even at low level.
---
Well, nearly a full day later. cleared cache, checked validity of files, manually deleted the download so it'd re download the patch...  
---
Game still won't launch. Claims it's missing privileges to the files.  
---
Think I'm officially done with this shit show as I'm not re-downloading another seventy fucking gigs of files
---
As a raider faction who just likes the dresses.  The Order of Mansteries
---
The grenade drops when you die, but after you die your charekter cant get any more xp. You only get xp if you are alive
---
No
---
Yeah, they haven't really fixed anything in their delay. If you want to join the event, you need to join a teammate via fast travel and hope that his instance isn't full.
---
ABSOLUTELY R3T4RD3D
---
Is that seriously your logic? That‚Äôs like saying a Bowie knife isn‚Äôt irrelevant because it can take out a level 3 ghoul with like 30 health. It‚Äôs all about dps. Something that does 500 damage a shot and can fire twenty rounds a second is better than something that does 700 but can fire 1 round every 8 seconds. I know you‚Äôre in r/teenagers, but it‚Äôs simple math
---
debatable. some say it was made in a lab and didn't come from the market. idk if it has been entirely proven.
---
You do realize that Steam is only 1 launcher and there is also the Bethesda launcher, and now Xbox Game Pass, and then of course the Xbox one and PS4?
---
I see far more console players than PC on this reddit, so I would assume there are more console players than PC overall. That would mean steams data can only track one of four, and most of the steam accounts with the game only have it because it was given for free to all players who owned it on Bethesda's launcher. I didnt switch, I still use the BL. 
---
It basically all means that Steam's stat tracking is a terrible source for getting accurate numbers of active players and achievement completion.
---
Right on.
---
This sub is full of complaining and ‚ÄúBethesda please‚Äù posts, half of which are stupid and impossible implement.
---
I find that the Market sub has much better discussion threads than this sub.
---
Hi,
---
I wasn't talking about the perception of something being scarce in this post. I'm talking about things actually being not only scarce, but unavailable.
---
Next, I didn't ignore the two articles you shared, and certainly not because I didn't like their content. They just weren't research and they were not about digital cosmetic microtransactions, so they did not persuade me one way or the other.
---
One of the articles seemed to support my post, as I previously indicated. I understand the marketing philosophy, I just think that it is flawed, particularly as it applies here
---
They aren't creating an effective illusion of scarcity to increase demand, they are creating an actual scarcity that prevents sales. I think that's bad business.
---
Additionally, l don't believe that people buy iPhones for $1000 because they are scarce, because everyone knows that iPhones are not scarce. Also, people that wait on line for something at launch have a different motivation than fear of scarcity; likely that having the product first will make them feel better about themselves in some way. If they actually believe they may not get an iPhone, they haven't paid any attention to the last 25 iPhone models which I've not noticed as scarce.
---
To simplify things, instead of debating academically, maybe consider this one question...
---
Have you personally spent more money at the Atomic shop due to vaulting scarcity?
---
I'm saying that this prevents me and others I know from spending money here, so I spend it elsewhere. I'm guessing that's not what Bethesda wants.
---
Cheers
---
FOMO is something that I despise with a bloody passion. I hate it and I want it to die a painful death. There are a number of items, not limited to, but including, the entire set (aside from the 1st) riot gear and paints, and a number of camp items. I would buy this if they were always available and I didn't feel pressured. I've actually not bought things I wanted before because I refuse to give in to the pressure for an inflated price. The only things I would buy immediately are the advanced/elite riot gear and the green paints for them.
---
Nah. Afaik all that s changed is the explosive damage legendary effect no longer triggers enforcer by itself. 
---
Enforcer will still blow legs off when actually aimed at the legs, but depending on your build and if you have a magic shotgun, this may not be of much value as you may simply kill them faster anyway
---
I have just started the game on PC. Players in game helping me a lot. Donating high level equipment and stuff... Someone even bought everything in my vendor and dropped them so that I can resell. Pretty happy about the community so far and the game is good.
---
no one will be angry, you dont need to join a group, just enter the event, your presence wont impact anyone else
---
Just drop your junk before hand then you have nothing to lose.
---
You can raise a ticket but honestly I doubt you'll get much success.
---
Can‚Äôt you just store the shed?
---
I disagree.
---
I have a problem and I need help
---
The other subs I‚Äôm in isn‚Äôt relevant to this. And maybe he doesn‚Äôt need 20000 DPS. Maybe he only needs the damage to take out that critter. And actually the Bowie knife kicks ass with the right build.
---
Depending on the problem I might be able to.
---
Had a level 45 show up last night in excavator armor, he died a few times but that happened to all of us.  If you join the event via fast travel you will arrive inside the mine, so radiation only is an issue at the end when you go outside. 
---
TL,DR: give it a try, bring stims, lots of ammo and a hazmat just in case.
---
Can't find it because it doesn't exist
---
What are cursed weapons?
---
Wdym bunker?
---
cool I'll try that thanks
---
Hey man some of us were around at launch. Talk about a basic as heck game. It's leeps and bounds better now.
---
If this is a real life experiment at least I'll have a lot of radaway and stimpaks. Maybe find a nice ghoul lady to settle down with.
---
Hi, I understand where you are coming from, and I agree with you about wanting them to be always on sale, but it is basic psychology that the average person is directly vulnerable to FOMO. If something is "discounted" or "limited time" the average human brain goes "YES YES GIVE IT TO ME I NEED IT". I'm not the average so it just annoys me and doesn't affect me, but that's because I am neurologically different due to autism. The average, normal-ish person will be incredibly addicted to these marketing strategies. It's why lootboxes are such a big thing.
---
Except based on the story we all came from the same vault where we lived 25 years peacefully.  Why wouldn't we be friendly when we meet each other in the surface?
---
I thought I read somewhere that about 6 withdrawal symptoms is what you want to maintain? Does the withdrawal itself not run off over time though? Like I said, I never use the things so aside of from alcohol for a challenge I've never had that happen (Or just popped an instant fix addictol so eh..)
---
I‚Äôve got thousands... let‚Äôs make a deal. ;)
---
Where you from and what time you play? Also user tag
---
Check the buttons on the bottom when At a weapon bench. One option is repair kit; the other is with scrap. Each weapon needs different types of scrap to repair
---
Yeah man go ahead and enter and get a few tags for the loot. Of anyone gets mad that's on them. I never get upset when newer/lower players join events. Now be prepared because if you're not geared up you're going to die... A lot. There are a lot of hazards and strong enemies in the mine. Just go in, have some fun, get some gear. You on PC? I could get you some decent legendary gear to get you started. It's stuff I don't use so you're welcome to it.
---
Work is getting in the way of my fallout grind and.. I need good "razor grain" for a fair price
---
If you‚Äôre talking about when you‚Äôre running and occasionally stagger, that‚Äôs typically caused when your ‚ÄúWell Fed‚Äù Buff wears out, or if you had other chems/buffs that give you HP.  It seems to trigger when you have that sudden loss of HP
---
we did one today, im sure others will as well
---
You left the game but stayed on the sub? Interesting.
---
I grow razorgrain at my camp. Feel free to take any as you please.
---
Never gonna give milk up, never gonna let it sour, never gonna run around and not milk you

Welcome Wastelander!

I'm on PC as well. User: DocB30tn    
---
My main is a Stealth Sniper at level 106. If you need some help I'll see what I can do. My CAMP has all of the crafting stations and a small farm. I can craft a lot of things. Send me a friend request when you get in game.    
---
I don't normally play until after 1p.m. or 8 p.m. CST.
---
How did you unlock it if you just started playing? It was a limited time release like 2-3 months ago
---
There it is!
---
Finally someone how asked the right question. Where is the balance?
---
After I heard about one Wasteland I remembered back to my time in elder scrolls online...
---
No balancing just scaling. I don't wanna fight for my life with molerats or mirelurk baby's wtf.
---
And finally you gave me the prove that this is just an other stupid simple scaling update and not more...
---
New (fixed) drops from the Colossal Problem event. The Curse is basically a 4th legendary effect if you will. It has increased damage and attack rate, but much lower durability.
---
99.99999 math 1in 3 for stars being 3 2in 15 primary God roll 2 in 15 second God roll 1 in 20 3rd godroll from a three-star enemy thats not mentioning the chances it even is a three-star spawned after chanceing that is not going to be level 50 or 45 and then the risk of some duchcanoo oneshoting the moleminer who may have been holding that godroll your odds are like 1 in 100000 for anything worth value
---
I'd love this!  There's a lot of gorgeous custom work in the basement HQ.  Whoever made those assets was clearly very invested in the idea.
---
I've been having this same discussion with my girlfriend, who has been waiting to buy some wallpaper she likes for weeks. Would bethesda sell more having everything available all the time, or are they creating a scarcity of resources and making people desperate to buy things when they are available? In my opinion they are exploiting the scarcity principle. I'm not a professional marketing psychologist, but I did study this stuff extensively in university, and I feel like I recognize it being applied here. They may have some derpy people doing QA testing, but they are absolutely applying the right psychological principles to the atom shop in order to take advantage of people's fomo and keep them checking back in. As soon as a decent wallpaper comes in to the shop that she likes, she'll immediately buy it regardless of the cost. I do agree that with a greater diversity in products, and them being fully stocked at all times would be better for the user, but I'm not so sure that it would actually generate more sales. I think a salient comparison might be how the McRib functions in the US. One thing I will say, is that the people who research how to manipulate human emotions to make them buy more things are very effective, and some of the strategies they use are anything but intuitive. It's manipulative because you often don't know when it's working.
---
I've learned that despite its durability bar it degrades faster than a normal one and you can't do anything about it - Cursed. You'll have to fix it more and stock up on whatever mats are needed.
---
Yeah I forgot to remove a few subs. This popped up in rising and reminded me.
---
It is in the game, I picked one out of the garbage can at Crevasse Dam last nigjt.ive never been able to make the magazines count for the challenges by buying or selling them. I have found Unstoppables at Crevasse Dam multiple times though.
---
I have seen many people post about how the "leave the vault" achievement never popped for them.
---
But it only happens when I'm around ash heep or cranberry.  Nowhere else does it
---
The new pack in the atom shop.
---
So it works like Martyrdom from COD:MW?
---
Are you wearing face protection in those areas (like a gas mask)?
---
How much
---
I unlocked it a month ago along with every Halloween, Christmas,  and Ghillie suit seasons reward.
---
hi,
---
if you want help on anything, ask
---
ign radenn
---
I mean, in my build, 2 cores is 2000 rounds and likely the queen will be dead.... but it all depends on the build and the group!
---
IMO a combination of things.    
---
Sneak maxed Rank 3. Any legendary effect which says "Harder to detect while sneaking."    
---
Muffled only works with the sound you make. The Chameleon effect on armor (I don't think it stacks though) or the mutation. I think the mutation is worse until you get an entire set of Weightless armor b/c that doesn't affect the mutation.
---
1000 atoms
---
I guess I'm fortunate that I'm not the average person in that regard either. I never understood lootboxes either.
---
 Thank you, I appreciate your post.
---
Usually when I'm going there yeah.
---
It doesn't take my health away either.  Just random stumbles as if they stand on punjis. But there are no punjis
---
Final Fantasy XI has a dungeon fight you can spam over and over that teleports you to an area to kill mobs and then a boss fight.  After the boss fight you're teleported back to the original area and there's a chest in the middle for everybody to loot.  This game is coming up on 20 years old and uses Playstation 2 technology.  I fully expect Bethesda to not be able to implement something like this, but instead they will add a new skin to the atom shop for a nominal fee $$$$
---
Some info on how I run my berserker. My build and some video at the bottom. 
---
I run a low health sneak commando berserker that I stay in serendipity. I find that the 45% damage avoidance is key for me. Plus I like the benefit of adrenal reaction and unyielding.
---
Serendipity combined with ricochet, level 1 sentinel pieces, blocker, lone wanderer/suppressor, and dodgy it really mitigates a lot of damage. Can‚Äôt wait to get the 20% damage resist from the new light armor legendary perk cards. 
---
I tried the armor breaking approach but I found that it was too much upkeep so I decided to go to level 1 armor. The big plus is I can get into my power armor and get the benefits from rad resist mods and a dense chest mod. 
---
My armor in the adds up to 12dr so I run psycho(-10dr) and medx(-10dr) addictions with a BOS resistant(8dr) under armor to get it back 0 for the full berserker effect. 
---
The following is the gear I use. 
---
-Lvl 5 Leather Chest- Dense Mutant Slayers Sent Powered
---
-Lvl 1 Leather LA- Lead Lined Assassins Sent Agitlity also have a Lvl 1 Unyielding WWR strength that I switch out on
---
-Lvl 1 Leather LL- Lead lined Unyielding Sneak Str
---
-Lvl 1 Wood RA - Unyielding Sent Powered
---
-Lvl 1 Leather RL - Lead lined Poisoners Ghoul Slayers Breathe Under Water
---
-Lead Lined Backpack 
---
The dense chest combined with fireproof mitigates almost all explosive damage and scortchedbeast scream attacks
---
The lead lined limbs and lead line back pack mitigates a lot of rad intake
---
As for ER I use grounded 
---
I have 1 poison resist piece but would prefer to have 2. 
---
Another thing to look out for is if you combine the chameleon mutation with strange in numbers you will get a random 40Dr.

---
Ahhh so not quite ‚Äújust started now‚Äù.
---
Well yeah, it should be under outfits at the armorer workbench.
---
Because people on this sub think they can define "fun" for someone's experience.
---
Didn‚Äôt read your whole comment, just the end.
---
But sure the artificial scarcity will put some people like yourself off, but you are in the minority.
---
Bethesda does the things the way it does because it works. They use the same model over at Elder Scrolls Online, because it works...
---
And frankly, I‚Äôd rather have what we have now, rather than lootboxes, which are also present over at ESO.
---
I can't be mad about the event. As a part time developer, I will argue that PTS is a small sample players of the entire FO76 population. This means you get only a limited amount of interactions and possibilities during testing. When this goes live you have so many new people doing so many different things that you most certainly find more bugs. PTS is a sandbox, a controlled environment. Very rarely will a sandbox test translate to real world flawlessly. It sucks we have to deal with it, like everything else, but we can only hope for the best. Other things they can do is tweak their testing methodologies... Perhaps where players are given tasks or goals to actually try and break the game.
---
I don't get it. I'm about to make my .38 and 10mm ammo free, I can't seem to get rid of it, even at 1 cap each. I think some people who have FO1st and don't realize players simply won't buy overpriced items aren't motivated to reduce weight in their stash for lack of extra space. If I'm selling my chems above 10 caps a piece, they won't sell and I'll end up offloading them for a fraction of that at a train station because their weight will add up to an unmanageable amount. The stash limit seems to encourage pricing things to sell.
---
It was when you went to the National Isolated Satellite Array.
---

The existence of a workaround for a flaw does not remove the responsibility to repair that flaw.

I can drive around a pothole, but the city still has a responsibility to repair the road.

But it's happening to THEM!

Just have hopefully I get a refund although unlikely
---
What a shame.
---
on the pts for 3 months and even more internally and you have 6 day 1 showstoppers, lol
---
Honestly that was my guess for nuclear winter
---
I like fallout 76, but it's seriously lacking in basic end game content or any kind of content that warrants playing EVERYDAY.
---
for me it is available with the other atom shop rugs (the pinkish one and the brown with red print and raffles are in the same slot for me). However the picture of the rug is taken from the side so it kind of shows up as a thin dark brown stripe against a dark background in the picture of the build menu while the other rugs are shown from above (which makes more sense). it is very easy to scroll over because of this.
---
Just have doubtful it will get a response
---
....but depending on your build and if you have a magic shotgun, this may not be of much value as you may simply kill them faster anyway...
---
Thank you for your feedback
---
I really wish this was addressed. We had this happen to one of our 4 in game tonight. Couldn‚Äôt play Nuclear Winter together because we couldn‚Äôt send him a team invite. 
---
1) Tried changing icon
---
2) adding a non friend to see if they could get him to show online 
---
3) Changed appearance on Xbox App (PC to Online)
---
4) rebooted the pc and game several times and nothing worked.

As I understand it, the benefits of a junkie build tops out at five addictions, so there's no point in getting addicted to more than five things. There's some discussion of which drugs are "best" to be addicted to, in terms of which debuffs are least inconvenient. For example, if you never use daytripper or calmex, maybe getting addicted to them is a good idea since you'll always be in withdrawl from them and thus always get that damage buff. The addiction never goes away without addictol.
---
They are slowly making it unplayable on purpose so they can scrap it and go back to single player fallout. The reality of the situation is pvp made this game a hot mess from day one and should have never been an option the hype for pvp pulled in people who would have never touched it and created a window for griefers that should have never existed, now all Bethesda does is listen to people who cry real loud and the high level players that are bored want everyone to suffer because they grenade glitched and have lv1800+ characters that are boring to play , everyone needs to accommodate the cheaters because ‚Äú boo hoo , god mode is too easy! ‚Äú
---
No no he‚Äôs got a point, the event has been delayed for that long something like this shouldn‚Äôt be happening
---
&gt;	One of the articles seemed to support my post, as I previously indicated.
---
It actually did not if you read the two sentences before and after what you quoted.
---
I wonder if that hits some people harder than others.  I play a couple hours a day, and havent run into that bug in weeks - maybe months.
---
SBQ goes down due to bugs and "magic" weapons no build will one shot her without an exploit
---
Molerats should have the same scale rule as critters, max scale is level 25.
---
Lootboxes are actually something that get me for some reason. I avoid them and gambling like the plague where possible. I was playing hearthstone today and just impulsively bought a pack that went on sale (gave a bunch of crafting resources) and spent ¬£16 on a shiny golden card for the worst deck I have ever made in a card game, just because everything is going to be gold. Do I regret it, probably. Do I know why I thought it was a good idea? Nope. I'm just gonna own it and NOT do that again.
---
Can you hang the disco ball? Everything needs more disco ball lights.
---
You will get a refund if it was your first time sending a ticket for this issue. It may take a bit, I am not sure how swamped their CS is.
---
Who talked about fun? o.o I mentioned balance, that's all.
---
Gauss shotgun is king, even without any perks equipped. I primarily run a bloodied heavy weapons build, but I use an instigating gauss shotgun to smite trash mobs, and just about any other critters that get in my way that aren't tanky enough to require a plasma caster or to break out the gauss minigun.
---
Is this "nerf" limited to damage? It could apply to other multiplicative stuff like exp gained or stealth.
---
I have wondered if there are invisible mods actually observing us all pottering around the map, seeing what sort of stuff we get up to.
---
What are the odds?  Anyone know? I keep trying...
---
Even With magic weapons and OP Bloodied/junkies builds, the OP is laying on the hyperbole with regards to how fast SBQ dies.
---
The Backpack + the Blue Ridge Outfit, Mask, and Flag all drop from Riding Shotgun. The Backpack seems to be the rarest.
---
Nukes and Dragons site for a build and stick to it. Near the bottom of the page after you make the build is a "Level by Level Perk suggestion list.    
---
You can't save up SPECIAL points b/c new perks don't show up until you start leveling it.    
---
IMO, always keep a high damage, Medium speed melee weapon on you. Most are fairly cheep and easy to repair. No perks needed to waste but if you get a 2hd one in a pack that's a bonus. You can 1 hit lower level mobs to save on ammo.    
---
Craft the Tinkerer's  bench asap at your camp. Memorize what's needed for the ammo you use and prioritize the junk for it. Only make Gunpowder when you need to craft ammo.    
---
Upgrade or find a higher level asap unless it's a Legendary as most are made to last for many levels.    
---
Corn soup is very easy to make and fills both the hunger and thirst meter. It takes up a lot less space than two items that only fill one meter.
---
I've just quit because of the insane chore-like grind. The Division 2 treats me better.
---
Steam sales.
---
Ive picked up a bunch of games on steam sales with hefty discounts i havent gotten around to playing yet, and might not ever. I would not assume most of the people who havent played spent at least $60, 50% off or higher sales are not uncommon.
---
If fallout 2 had achievements i wouldnt be counted, i couldn't get out of the tutorial temple. It cost less than $5 on sale though, so i dont feel ripped off.l, and have plenty of other games to play.
---
Fo76 was half off for the steam summer sale, or i wouldn't be playing.
---
Just to be clear the ones with 300 range are the blood eagle ones and the ones with the 700 range are the glitched one from Nuclear Winter since they tend to get confused.
---
I've got a handful of these blood eagle ones. I kept 2 of the level 45 ones for each the laser rifle and the assault rifle as well. Then I kept a level 5 laser rifle for leveling. It's a pretty damn efficient killing machine for my alts to use until they can get to some of my mid level stuff.
---
have you consider that maybe some people *want* to one shot the thing?
---
Bloody Flamer, with Adrenal Reaction Mutation (don't take Grounded Mutation as it lowers your energy damage), all 9 perks in Strength for Heavy Gunner, Nerd Rage in Intelligence, Bloody Mess in Luck. That's basically it. That's basically it. Bloody and Adrenal Reaction is most of your damage.
---
Ammo for Flamer is one of the most expensive to keep up as it drains really fast. And the Flamer breaks All the Time.
---
‚ÄúBoo hoo , I‚Äôm bloody and if I die in the event I‚Äôm f‚Äôed‚Äù all I‚Äôm seeing today and it‚Äôs glorious, anyone worth their ass has been laughing at bloody builds for months because it‚Äôs a trash glass cannon build. I have no idea why an entire community has to accommodate one build that is honestly hot garbage. 
---
Also yes, I think bloody builds are garbage and people who can‚Äôt play 76 any other way need to seriously reconsider calling themselves gamers.
---
Ive been seeing these as well since P21. Though my freezes are generally between 10-20 seconds long. It seems to be related to asset loading as it always happens when im approaching something that would require a terrain or region update.
---
This "event" is a total CLUSTERF...! sorry. just "participated" with my rifleman. was the first time. couldnt loot ANY thing. this "mission" seems to prefer PA-Builds.
---
How do you use a private world to transfer items to your main character?
---
Isn‚Äôt relevant? That either means that you‚Äôre too young and lacking in competence to construct a compelling argument, or you‚Äôre a pedophile who enjoys looking a photos of children on a teenager sub. The point is, it‚Äôs simply not viable. Sure, with the right perks you can maybe two shot a level 60 charred feral ghoul. A fixer can one shot it, a 50 cal can 2-3 shot, a sniper can one shot, a melee can 1-2 shot, etc. all of that is proof enough, even when you don‚Äôt take into account that it fires 6-7 shots a minute. The fact that you have to abuse an exploit to even make it slightly more viable proves my point
---
Same issue with the log cabin.
---
You're already a tester for Atom shop items and you're paying to do so. Why would they let you do it for free?
---
Joined an event today, I just joined like any other event. When I ported in I had to go further into the mine where the others were. You spawn up at the top. I wasn't on a public team though, so that might have been a difference?
---
Incompetence is one of Bethesda's strongpoints.
---
It's PTS. Not finished. It may or may not come to "production" like this.
---
Perhaps they will buff the base damage (I hope so).
---
It‚Äôs funny, because your argument is based on ‚Äòhere are studies using multiple people‚Äôs input‚Äô and OP‚Äôs is ‚Äòhere is my singular opinion‚Äô. 
---
Even just skimming through this, it‚Äôs clear that OP thinks their individual opinion and experience is ~~equal to~~ greater than the experience of 100+ people. 
---
That‚Äôs quite amusing, and quite entitled.
---
Patch 22 will be very interesting for sure. I‚Äôm keeping an open mind that in the end we will end up enjoying the game even more.
---
In my experience they were, I have more than one collectron damage the last time I did this.  And since you can get 4 turrets for "free" using the workshop resources it doesnt hurt.
---
Wow. How other people play the game really upsets u doesn‚Äôt it!
---
I read it wrong, thought he wanted to not allow to rejoin event while downed, like in v94 raids where you have to do all over again when killer.
---
so just smash and grab and just die under the collapsing mine? seems like a legit strategy for this game. i¬¥ll give it a try.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Someone in your team launched probably a nuke. That's how I completed the quest too.
---
There are six year olds smarter than two of you put together. Age. Is. Irrelevant.
---
It does when the entire game ends up revolving around one build and one group of people who cry really loud until they get their way
---
That isn't the NW one they're discussing, it is completely different.
---
A mesh issue in this game? Impossible.    
---
_looks at the Fastnacht beret that still hasn't had its mesh fixed after 2 years_    
---
Maybe slightly possible.
---
Same, this game has massive potential and keep hoping for it, but don't actually want to play it that much lol
---
Tbf scrip is a stupid word
---
You‚Äôre sitting here arguing that a gun that fires a single round every 6-10 seconds and averaged 60-200 damage is more effective than ones that do similar damage but at 12-84 times the fire rate
---
Atoms are useless, Fo1 isnt. In fact, i wouldnt be playing if 1st werent a thing.
---
That‚Äôs not why. A vendor with no power doesn‚Äôt show up at all unless you‚Äôre on their team.
---
With the right build and buffs, I‚Äôve had BP rifles hit at 20k damage a hit. My friend got even more, because he had access to buffs I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm pretty sure there are people who know more than both of us who‚Äôve boosted the damage even higher. That‚Äôs more than your B2525 Fixer could ever do.
---
Nah
---
I know haha.  I‚Äôm done with the back and forth lol. I provided the actual research. There is a lot written on this subject. We as individuals can like or not like it, but it doesn‚Äôt change consumer behavior as a whole. Oh well.
---
Don‚Äôt worry , bloody builds will drown out anything anyone has to say because they know how Bethesda devs function. They are hipster moms in a grocery store just cry real loud and mommy will get you a latte little bloody baby
---
As a Gatling Lazer / Gatling Plasma player I'm sad that cores don't drop. Not that I have time to pick anything up. Is it shitty if I just decide to farm wendigos for screws during the fight? Lol.
---
I‚Äôm thinking u haven‚Äôt a clue what a bloodied build actually is. Or are u against every low health build?  In fact I think I know what your problem is.  Using the bow has warped your sensibilities and made you angry and a little  confused. Join us. Join us. You know you want to.
---
IMO, SS Underarmor is the best in the game for any build. It provides NO benefit initially. The SS Shielded lining is the best for it so don't waste gold on the lesser Linings. Make sure you read the full description of the SS Underarmor Shielded Lining plan b/c that's the one you want. You will need several materials including a certain type of flux.    
---
That flux also needs a few mats to become stable. You can find this all on the wiki and I don't have the compiled info at the moment. At least craft the SS Underarmor and stick it in your stash while you work at getting that plan and mats for it.    
---
I haven't crafted any SS Armor as it's a random thing with effects and yet another time sink.
---
Yes. It happened to me just after patch 21.
---
Happy birthday . Enjoy the pie . There‚Äôs no in game buff from it but it‚Äôs very satisfying in RL .
---
no one is forcing you to play bloodied you know.
---
I love the flamer, nothing has fire resistance and it'll melt through damn near anything, just a regular non legendary flamer with a napalm tank and does less than 200 damage but works just as well üòÅ (power armor heavy gun user)
---
&gt;	It‚Äôs manipulative because you often don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs working.
---
Exactly!
---
..and now I want a McRib!
---
I would love to see any such research. Those articles were articles, not research.
---
Even if we pretend that you really did get it to 20k a hit, with the fire rate that‚Äôs about 2k-3.3k a second. My J33 fixer (I don‚Äôt use bloodied like you) can easily do like 7-10k a second if I fire it automatic. A pump shotgun is more effective. A hunting round with 50 cal or the right build is more effective. A laser rifle is more effective. It‚Äôs not about fixers, it‚Äôs about every other gun with the exception of some pipe guns, an unmodded 10mm, a syringer , and a flare gun
---
Pipe is life!
---
For some reason the base 76 game is being sold without Wastelanders.    
---
It should be standard by now. I pre-ordered 76 and like so many we got a lot of benefits from it.
---
Mhh ok never noticed it. But I saw some other replys here where someone says it's when the owner of the camp is joining or leaving the world. Which sounds logic to me.
---
Cannot not cannon
---
I‚Äôve gotten refunds in the past. Sometimes it takes awhile. I thought I was claiming the free weekly item one time and accidentally selected a wall paper next to it. Mistakes happen. Support is understanding. It just may take 3 days-3 weeks to get a response.
---
fed76.info is a good resource to know the going rates. A lot of traders use that to get the general ballpark price of a weapon/armor piece.
---
i checked on playstation and it said i didnt have a subscription and then i was charged the next month.  i believe i was able to cancel through the android app under subscriptions the next time around
---
I'd like to just be able to craft the gun and sword. Dropped the originals while tired and had forgotten I still needed them for the level 50 ones.
---
Fuckin better I swear on god I put 5 stars into that jawn
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/7/75/Mappalachia_fluxes_cobalt.jpg/revision/latest
---
There's a map there, via https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_cobalt_flux
---
Watch for people nuking monagnah mine for the event, south of the mine theres some raw cobalt, but its spread a bit around elsewhere too. I was able to grab 20+ there last night, but i wasnt using the map. (After crashing a few times).
---
Agreed re: PTS data.  I suspect we'll see a relative flattening of the potential damage range of top-end builds, which is a good thing IMHO.
---
I'm in the "stepping up from Instigating" boat right now.  I'm having a great time and interested in getting better at building my character.
---
Was that from the floating damage numbers?
---
Also did you have other damage perks on,like all the rifleman ones + bloody mess?
---
The cursed effect adds 15% damage and 20% firerate/swing speed. The durability is -4 but I don't know what that translates to.
---

---
Can't post build here right now but some pointers, not only for guns
---
* enforcer perk obviously but is broken nowadays (add it to the list...)
---
* lots of AP to get max out of VATS (magic shotguns): action boy/girl, custom fitted legs, powered armor
---
* I prefer combat shotguns but haven't tried gauss (reputation not high enough, this is my 5th char)
---
* I have TSE, AAE, QE. No BE or JE because I'm neither bloodied or junkie. All of them are crap compared to the 'magic' ones. Magic effects are +33% vats hit chance, 50% limb damage and bashing damage. I prefer  the latter since limited testing revealed it as most reliable. Try to combine this with reduced vats cost legendary effect since the magic effect is only happening in vats. One day, they'll probably fix it so keep an eye out for the 'normal' shotguns. The fancy pump action shotgun you can get with claim tickets is also 'magical'.
---
* adamantium skeleton (yes, also broken atm, sigh) and/or fireproof  and/or dense torso armor piece is a must for explosive shotguns. I use all 3 so I can not blow myself up.
---
* skeetshooter perk is also good.
---
* there is a way to get negative range on a shotgun (modding the gun a certain way), which gives it infinite range. Fun for a few minutes.
---
* exploding harpoon guns made into a shotgun (the flechette mod) can obliterate enemies. Just don't miss (reload time is huge). Legacy since patch 19 though.
---
* What I haven't tried: an armor piece with reduced damage while blocking can apparently make any shotgun 'magical'. Waaay back in the days the TSE shotgun was th√© meta so I'm curious to see the difference with my current 'magic' shotguns when equipping this armor. So yeah, definitely be on the lookout for that armor.
---
* My armor is kind of a test, it is auto stim armor mostly powered. I wouldn't do that if it is your only character since it eats stims like crazy. I would make sure your armor is powered though.
---
* In my humble opinion, an instigating bashing damage less vats cost combat shotgun is currently probably the best (magic) shotgun out there.
---
* Do not use an IE shotgun. When you kill the first enemy, the splash damage will take of health of nearby enemies thus making the instigating effect useless for all enemies that received some splash damage (they are no longer at full health so the instigating effect won't work)
---
It was fixed on ps4 last patch.
---
The most annoying thing is just all those delays. It's almost september and the wendigo collossus isn't even on console yet. If they keep up this pace then we wont see legendary perks until end of year and daily ops early next year and so on. There are a lot of bugs for sure but as long as they are not game breaking I can probably live with that. But no content is for me personally way worse there is nothing to do
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
That‚Äôs the most common cause, yes. Or when the player that sees it is not yet fully ‚Äòloaded‚Äô in.
---
The op thinks that his opinion applies to himself, hence the use of words like "I" and "opinion".
---
Ty very much, you Made my day
---
How well does flamer do against SBQ, Earl, and other end game enemies?
---
It's working in the live game
---
Carry a melee weapon for stuff like mole rats and save the ammo for the big stuff
---
Rose herself tells you the keys to this situation.
---
*Not everyone in the wasteland wants to be your friend.*
---
*And sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do to get by.*
---
Think of it like this: You may not like them, but if you dont get them innoculated, they are just going to become infected with the scourge virus and become an even bigger problem for you and the settlers. And Rose is the key to gaining a face to face meeting with their leader. So cowboy-up and get the job done.
---
This person nailed it. Flamer builds are tough to up keep. I would keep a rifle or pistol to take out small enemies so you dont waste ammo on them with the flamer.
---
Nah , screaming I‚Äôm down again into my mic isn‚Äôt my kinda thing
---
Yea i was hitting 500's with my vamp gatlin gun yesterday
---
But the lead pipe is guaranteed to be three star, right? That‚Äôs soooo special since the queen only drops one star most of the time.
---
Can confirm, working again...
---
Most people let them get away with buggy releases since up till recently, there weren't many open world, first person, RPGs, and those that were being made weren't up to the same grand scale Bethesda had been doing. Also Bethesda knows fans will just patch their game better then they ever could. Thou that doesn't work when the game is online so it can't be modded. Doesn't help either that they have been using the same game engine for 18 years and are too cheap to just use another engine or make a new one. Gamebryo/Creation engine are garbage and the fact they plan to use it for Starfield and more then likely Elder Scrolls 6 is just going to hurt those games even more.
---
Without context, this was a very confusing, ominous, and hilarious post to come across
---
lol. And also someone who clearly hasn‚Äôt played the game?  Or maybe that‚Äôs just your friends.  Not sure about anyone else but I don‚Äôt play on a mic with anyone but friends in a group lol. And also if u think bloodied and low health die quickly all the time you 100% don‚Äôt know what your talking about. Stick to the bow twinkle. That‚Äôs complicate enough for you üòò
---
Come see me-  I will help you tooüôÇ HoneyHack77 10PM CST
---
Usually not on your hours (east coast) but IGN is the same....
---
There's no 'main' group.
---
The first 8 people to enter the event are in a group, the next 8 people to enter the event are in the same group, and so on
---
Have you been on for a while? They were disabled a few months back because there was a problem with them, and so everything was put into stash boxes
---
Out and out, yes. Shotguns are crazy op. I run a fully mutated, bloody build. All my shotguns are doing between 1,000 and 2,500 dps, with the exception of the gauss which hits as high as 4,000. My friend on the hand runs a 0 mutation, full health shotgun build, and is getting similar numbers, but he doesn‚Äôt have his gauss yet.
---
Thank you for this.  I got the Cursed Shovel last night, and haven't been able to find any other information on it.
---
I question if 4 is in the game I have a few 5s that I found in the bog.
---
Steam sales are a thing, and bundles do happen. Ive got almost 600 titles on my steam account and ive played maybe a quarter of them. I have two versions of Skyrim that i have never played. And one version of FO3 that i have never played. Despite having played *other* versions of the same games on steam for hundreds of hours each.

---
There you go. Make sure you read the whole thing. It‚Äôs lengthy but you might learn something.
---
It‚Äôs just the stagger effect. Use pneumatic armor mod to reduce staggers.
---
I just tried the event he glitched inside the walls, failed the event.
---
Easier to die and run back in than use up the stim packs.  The mine is usually at the edge of a nuke zone, so you can keep running out of it when you exit the mine
---
Beside that, try to make some ultracite ammo from what the wendigo gives you, or from the flux around the event. 
---
Oh wait...
---
Ran the new thing 3 times yesterday, it will get old quickly...
---
Or simply just adjust the benefits of having low health
---
A cursed fat man will break after just three shots? Some weapons are already cursed since launch lol
---
Thank you. I do appreciate your time and discussion.
---
OP also said *‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the only one.‚Äù*
---
So let‚Äôs make this a very specific question; ***do you believe that this marketing strategy has influenced anyone to make a purchase that they otherwise would not have made?***
---
Just a yes or no answer, please.
---
Or a one day only bonus with unlimited notes resets or something if we are lucky
---
Gotcha nah he meant it as instead of dying all together just having an infinite bleedout timer during the event to avoid all the shenanigans
---
I can only absolutely agree.
---
Its funny. The bug that led to them delaying the release of the event so that they could fix it has still landed on the release version of the event.
---
/slowclap @ Bethesda
---
My three start pickaxe I got yesterday from this event has something to say here.....
---
Everyone's special in their own way
---
ü§£ guess how often I die in a queen fight lol zero times , you people are so full of shit it‚Äôs ridiculous. I can‚Äôt go one fight without someone in area screaming that they are dead and ‚Äúwhy aren‚Äôt I getting rezzed ‚Äú you aren‚Äôt getting rezzed because everyone hates you .
---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. I run a vffr and jffr a lot, as well as a Ve and je haha, and absolutely love them.
---
 Any build for flamers is just a standered heavy build. Flamers are great weapons. Super hard to keep fed though
---
Well, I'm not sure how the scaling is tuned, but if you look at Nuclear Winter, where high level critters were possible already, according to the wiki a Deadly Molerat is level 95, has 800 HP and does 95 damage while a Radscorpion Emperor is level 90, has 1500 HP and deals 155 damage (plus some poison).  So yeah, I can totally see three of those rat killing the radscorpion if they scale the critters in Adventure similarly to what we have in NW.
---
Or you know, just a different heavy like a gattling.
---
No, inside.
---
Enter private world, put items in a container, the preferred ones are suitcases at train stations because they have no weight limit (do not drop them on the ground!!). Log out, change characters and log back in to your private world. Go to the same container and voila you have transferred your items.
---
If you accidentally join a public world or take too long to change characters you will not rejoin the same private world. Practice with some meaningless items/junk until you feel comfortable moving more valuable stuff. There is always a small chance the server will lag/reset though so still be cautious
---
Fastest solo non magic weapon ranged time is something 17 sec; fastest solo melee is 7. Both held by Tyr.

I already tried unequip-relog-reequip-relog, it didn't work. So looks like this is another 'fix it yourself' thing... So gutted my CAMP was built with a lot of methods they removed in patch 21.

Cool. I tried that but it kept putting me outside. I will try it if it happens again though.
---
Or lower the health at which said benefits go into effect
---
Why would that even matter?
---
I did complete the story.  It wasn't used in an attempt to find the Queen's nest.  That was a sonic detection system developed by Squire Takano of in Silent Hills and sent to the East coast group to use.  Squire Takano's system worked which is how they found the Queen's lair and launched Operation Touchdown...which was a failure.  We just needed MODUS to help us launch a nuke at it.
---
This sub doesn't reflect my in game experience at all. I'm not saying 76 is the most well made and best game I've ever played or anything; but currently it's the only game I even play. And I can play with my wife! So I'd suggest just logging in for an hour and having a look around when you get curious.

i mean it's not like the first real time the Brotherhood ever encountered Super mutants before it was via a Mutant who was literally trying to create a master race out of them and many if not all of the surviving mutants from the Masters army opening admit they would still be turning people into mutants if their base was not but rubble and filled with Enclave, following that it's not like the next place they found massive mutant populations was places like the Pitt filled with a little known mutant called the [trog](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Trog) AND THEN it's not like Washington DC which was filled with Ghouls and over run with Super mutants that could rival the size of the Masters army out west, so i guess a little  Anthropomorphobia when it comes with one of the great (and fucking overused) monsters of the wasteland is in order and it's a little more then "we hate all mutants"
---
Hold on - the mine isn't irradiated?
---
Right. Weight might be a problem though lol
---
Commander Daguerre should rebuild the Order!
---
Kudos to you for thinking of others!
---
Ah. That makes sense. 
---
And I wish I had an SSD. Still not made that switch. Maybe someday. ü§û
---
The real issue was some of the stacking &amp; multipliers used with the build, plus Unyielding Armor. 
---
The changes in the PTS right now solve part of the challenge by making the damage effect bonuses "additive" instead of multiplicative. This is how it should have been done from the beginning &amp; mitigates the "god-tier" ability for bloodied characters to routinely do thousands of points of damage.
---
Now, I've heard that there are some issues with the way this was implemented when it comes to melee bloodied - making it nearly useless, so I expect that we'll see some tweaks before it goes live.
---
Personally, my build was not dependent on any kind of "effect" - so I expect that I'll see a minimal change to my own damage numbers.
---
Oh look at the possum! You might be all katywompus from the radiation, but I'm still gonna give all three of your little heads a pat! 
---
(all three heads bite you).
---
2 words for you. Bear arms. I carry more weapons than fit on my fav wheel
---
I agree. Also Reddit in general is probably the last place in the world I would go for "positive news" about anything.
---
50 cal explosive to Earl, ski sword to the wendingos.  Swing that thing, had up to 6 attacking me at once - computer could not keep up with things.
---
3960 points yesterday from one event
---
Oh yup right.
---
They didn't but then, neither did we.  Didn't take all that much to uncover the Enclave and get MODUS on board.
---
One person said that they thought Adrenaline wasn't working in the PTS - but since I'm not seeing 100 posts about it, I believe it's still okay on the Test Servers.
---
In live, it's working just fine - fingers crossed they don't break it again.
---
Something similar happened to me awhile ago. It was caused by modding a laser rifle into a laser pistol while it was equipped.
---
I could only use that weapon until I logged out and logged back in again.
---
Maybe that was what happened with you?
---
Thats just crap, I know every time I nuke ive gotta play the inventory manager mini game to remove the mini nuke and 6+ missiles they give me. Then I gotta FT home to play the scrap mini game to get rid of the 10+ random weapons they've given me. Then its off to the queen.
---
real brotherhood hostility only started after the NCR-enclave war when the brotherhood realised it was possible that large catches of Enclave weaponry was being captured by the NCR for their armies before that they lived by a very "leave us alone and we won't reduce you to ash" policy hell the first time since the war the brotherhood acted was sending three guys (two knights and a paladin) to help the Vault Dweller scout the Masters base
---
ok, ty
---
Nobody is forced to play bloodied , we are just forced to hear about it and plan every update around bloody builds crying into their headsets. Just look at all these bloodied builds I‚Äôve offended lol , losing their shit because I have the balls to call them babies
---
I may be alone on this but I have no issue with the damage of bloodied builds.  To me, the imbalance exists in the fact that you are able to gain so much more XP if your build can utilize unyielding armor.
---
In any MORPG or MMO a build being a glass cannon and having high DPS is not abnormal but a build that by it's nature allows you to earn drastically more XP than the other options is kind of absurd.  I cannot think of a serious online RPG game I have played where this was the case.
---
I'd love it if Sofia was involved...
---
It doesn't help. You can only have one water collection animation going at once. I tried this with the hand pump a while back.
---
If you are looking for a community that focuses on the game more than mechanics and systems /r/fo76FilthyCasuals is great for that.
---
Yeah, you need  a pretty full team all hitting hard or one player with an SBQ melting hacked weapon, then you're ok.
---
A bunch of casuals running full health/mix and match  builds stand very little chance.
---
The 3 events I have done have completed within 10 mins or so.
---
I solo completed it half an hour ago just to see if it was possible. Seems about as tough as the SBQ. Initial thoughts were that it's a welcome end game challenge for players both in groups and solo (for those that enjoy the punishment and Ammo sponge). Overall impression is that it's fun and I hope to see more bosses like this in future
---
I was using BOS combat armor ultralight, then I got my secret service armor so now I‚Äôm using that, chest piece has the jet pack.
---
The bad old times. Or are we still there?
---
I read in another thread that if you log out while someone is looking through your vendor it will unassign the items in it. Not sure if this is true though.
---
Get in now while you can get a full team, this will die a slow death...
---
The thing that irks me is - I can't get a skin for my combat shotguns.
---
I want to skin them - so I don't have a risk of scraping (for scrip) by accident, or transferring to an alt, etc.  
---
Why?  none are available in the store.....
---
The first 3 Fallout games used ammo for rippers and power fists
---
Store everything around it except the floor and then place it. I've had issues making walls face the correct way and this worked but it is super annoying lol.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
What causes that?
---
Why is it the fault of the players?
---
Good feedback here
---
If by bats you mean psycho meat eaters...
---
I found a good exception to the legendary sales is the 90% reduced weight minor effect - because people want to display these items and will pay decent caps for them
---
So a mutant slayers handmade would sell for about 1k or more caps - if it means someone can display their screaming eagle skin at their camp :)
---
Too accurate XD
---
"Hey Duchess ive found out where those bandits are coming fr..."
---
**"BOY! BOY IS THE KEY!"**
---
"Er, Duchess, what what that?"
---
*"What was what honey?"*
---
**"BOY IS THE KEY!"**
---
"That!"
---
*"Didnt hear anything sweetie. You find out where those bandits were coming from yet?"*
---
"Uh, okay... Yeah they are based out of some lum..."
---
**"BOY IS THE FRIGGIN KEY!"**
---
"Yes. At last. Signal receiv-- what... what are those... things? They appear to be... everywhere. "
---
" We suppose we understand now why it is you wanted to join us. Speaking of which, you've kept your end of the bargain. Let us fulfill ours. "
---
" We've ordered the Kovac to drop off ... a little care package. Return once you've collected its contents. "
---
However, he does say Scorchbeast exactly twice:
---
" A local militia calling themselves the Brotherhood of Steel thought they could even use them to wipe out the Scorchbeast population. "
---
And
---
" You, however, can use them to help those still above ground. There are monsters above. The signals I intercepted called them "Scorchbeasts."
---
Do u get event rewards and xp if u die at the end and spawn outside the cave?
---
From my experience, at least half of the PTS forum is people asking for completely unrelated changes, buffs, nerfs or fixes.  The stickied discussions are the primary sources for player feedback, and you generally have to wade through solid pages of two players having an argument about some tiny detail.
---
All of that makes me wonder how much valuable info is gleaned from the testers.
---
But if you're not doing the dailies, doesn't that mean you're not earning any treasury notes? Or do they come from other quests too?
---
No, HE helped YOU get access to the silos.
---
I agree the "im leaving" claims are dumb and teenage-levels of dramatic. but the suggestions and bug reports are in no way stupid NOR impossible to implement...
---
despite its reputation as 'whining' or whathaveyou, these people are actually useful and are expressing how they *want* to keep playing and they *want* to love the game. 
---
the parroting of each suggestion, bug report or complaint is a good thing. community managers are active &amp; can witness these posts (and inevitably experience these bugs on livestreams, ahem) and actually do something about it.
---
honestly, maybe if y'all played the game as much as y'all browse the subreddits, maybe y'all would experience these problems enough to not be completely fuckin ignorant &amp; downright insulting to people who are actually passionate about the franchise &amp; game.
---
I would buy a lot more at the Atomic shop if I have somewhere to put them.
---
Its on pc only ? üòÆüòû
---
I actually encountered one two nights ago. I was just wandering around on my way to some cabin I have never discovered and needed to get something to drink. As Im in my Pip-Boy this thing just appears out of nowhere! I had such a big fright I just shot bullets everywhere. Im in the lvl 200s. It was fking scary hahaha!!!
---
I switch back and forth between the two. Neither gets on my nerves like many of the people report on here. Both catch a ton of slack from communities. I still love both! Although I am getting pretty tired of getting vacuum tubes and chasing down deserters! Especially when the "daily" seems to activate about every two or three days! I should have my ammo factory by 2025!
---
Luck perk One Gun Army Max rank grants 12% chance to stagger
---
Good to know.  Those are a bit out in the middle of nowhere for me so I haven't done them.
---
My sniper build was fine for killing them but, when I tried any other, it was just awful. Shotgun was by far the worst.
---
Right now. Console is later this week.
---
Boi?
---
I saw somebody selling it for 10 caps at the vendor so I immediately bought it. Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt been able to find the hat yet.
---
what? that doesn't even make sense. just like no one is forcing you to play bloodied, no one is forcing you to read bloodied comments.
---
I don't even
---
That seems time and resource intensive.  Perhaps you could just answer my question directly?
---
It‚Äôs a bit more difficult on the pts with damage changes.  It feels like a proper end game event.
---
I did when I stayed there at the mine entrance.  Many times the event update would appear to get stuck, then I'd get completion and loot for the event.
---
I'm looking forward to trying out my Vampire +Limb Damage +Faster Reload Gauss Mini on this beast....on the regular Colossus, it seemed to melt him pretty fast.
---
I know, in this case, that I'll have the spawns to deal with, but at minimum, it should be fun.
---
I don't understand why. There will be more gold bullion weapons added that will also need a load of legendary modules. So I'm going to max out my gold and notes before I stop lol.
---
Tip:  don‚Äôt shoot the vertibots.  If you kill them first the cargobot flies away. I have no problem taking them down this way.   Also, as a lower level it can be a bullet sponge. Have a friend help out.
---
This perk is the kind of revengeful pettiness I can get behind!
---
My biggest issue was we had it almost dead and it said event failed with time still on the clock then it disappeared, that and fast traveling to and around the event is a shit show
---
You can get them from any group event with a few exceptions. Dailies aren't really needed at all unless you want something from that faction which a lot of people don't or either used an exploit to max rep quickly.
---
Well, I guess we got even more bugs now, does it count as bad? I dunno...
---
Join public building teams to gain extra xp. You don‚Äôt have to actually play with them or interact in any way just a free, easy passive intelligence buff
---
Where does this drop from?
---
Ironically, I did dedicate literally hours to reading terminal entries and holotapes.  I then dug out the actual dialog and sound files and did a bit more reading and listening.    I was still left in the dark about this.
---
Maybe if Brenda still had her comb she would be called smooth Brenda idk
---
I have two friends that sell the outfits and hats. At 100 caps each. So I wouldn‚Äôt consider them rare tbh. 
---
The plan to make them, yes it might be rare, but the outfits themselves not really.
---
the one time i got to do this event so far the map said there where 5 ppl at the event but when i got there it was just me and one person who refused to attack the boss and kept dying. 
---
so possible bug map telling you there are more ppl at the event then there actually are there
---
Ty
---
ü§£ü§£ untangled Brenda, Variations are endless
---
To my knowledge there is no outfit that goes along with the mask present in the files; If you could find the datamine you're referring to I'd appreciate it because in the files/esm there's no matching thing for it.
---
It's ok if some people are fighting the boss and others are concentrating on the adds. I have an Executioner's Plasma Gatling and a Fancy Shotgun. So far, I've been focusing on the adds with the shotgun until the boss gets to 50%, then whipping out the plasma gat to help finish him off.
---
yep, that's good idea and probably easy to implement.
---
Was on yesterday. Just seemed strange, but at least it gave me the opportunity to clean them up, lol.
---
You are reaching. Where did I say bug reports? I welcome bug reports, they are GOOD. Especially the ones that warn about broken Atomic Shop items and cold bullion items, so one can avoid buying them.
---
No. I mean the ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù posts where ‚ÄúAllies should switch outfits everyday‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should be able to craft and choose the perfect legendary prefixes for higher prices‚Äù posts.
---
And I find your tone extremely condescending... Just because I find this subs content to be very low quality and repetitive, means I don‚Äôt play the game or care about franchise???
---
Nice joke.
---
I did? I don't know how this comment got outside of the comment thread I was on but this was a reply to someone else.
---
To be honest i was one of those skeptical ones. Even after the wastelanders update, it painted as a piece of shit game.
---
A couple of days ago, i started to play out of boredom on xbone. And it seems it is not a bad game.
---
Though it seems i cant get used to this version of vats when camera constantly whirls around :(
---
I have had the respawn bug on every death over the last month and yes, it makes it so you can't continue the event if you die. I had to uninstall the game, which didn't help. Then I hoped the issue was related to the steam app. I deleted steam and then reinstalled the game and the bug is fixed (for now).
---
It was a decent enough story, though given it's nature, it literally couldn't have been told with NPCs.  I mean how are they going to tell you about the plague that killed everyone if they, themselves, obviously haven't been killed?
---
want a joke? go to r/jokes. this is a place for fallout 
---
I'm not reaching. you just weren't very specific. see my "tl;dr" section. I've said what i had to say.
---
I see nothing wrong here, especially if the exp is right.
---
she has lice
---
The APA-MRK1 will always be my favourite
---
Hmmmm.... what is this 'negative range' you speak of and who do I have to blow to find out how to replicate it?
---
Ahh he probs had tank killer, my armor meant nothing to him too. Ty!
---
They are features. *\*sighs\**
---
&gt;Do you people not have Flare Guns??
---
\- Bethesda, probably.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkz1oD2-q5I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkz1oD2-q5I)
---
Because then if you fail. You get nothing from the mobs. Not sure why i was downvoted to hell.
---
Pretty sure it‚Äôs just in one of the overseer cache‚Äôs early on in the main quest
---
No. You are reaching.
---
I said ‚ÄúBethesda Please‚Äù ‚ÄúSuggestions‚Äù.
---
I did not say ‚ÄúBug fixes‚Äù or ‚ÄúBug reports‚Äù.
---
This is extremely disingenuous argumentation.
---
Well you're right. First turrets are free.
---
see my "tl;dr" section, I've said what i had to say. I'm not reaching. you just weren't very specific.
---
Disappointing, I'd guess. What I want to know is what balancing they actually did?
---
It was a slog on the PTS and it still is in the live environment. 
---
Did it three times, silo run included. I got 6 flux in total, 1 plan and garbage weapons. They somehow managed to make the rewards even worse than what you can get from the Queen.
---
Yeah, not doing it again unless the rewards improve or the bullet sponge gets its damage resistance buffs brought down. 
---
It's absurd that this event depends on you having luck with the RNG.
---
Np.
---
\+33% vats hit chance is another magic mod to hunt for on shotguns. Its generally more common than limb damage.
---
The Op needs to understand that magic shotties *must* be used with vats for the broken dmg to occur. And they *must* also be close enough for the target for most if not all the pellets to hit. You cant snipe with it, you gotta man up and get right in there.
---
Mine must have been glitchy, it was trying to fly away when I found it with both vertibirds intact.
---
There's nothing to fix about bloodied for the simple reason it's volunteer. If you don't like it go addicted or get a nice instigating gun. If you don't like others to have a lot o power just join the bloodied club
---
He was half the brains behind all the tech they had, too. I doubt we'd get him to actually show up, but I'd love if we could have some kind of HAM radio conversation or something.
---
Cursed weapons, a few fun camp items
---
Don't feel too bad about it - you didn't lose anything, you can still launch nukes, and it saved you from having to complete an annoying mission.  
---
Don't forget to go see the overseer - I think she has a reaction to setting off a nuke.
---
Why is fast travel to the event hard? An event icon pops up, you map there for free and it places you inside the mine.
---
I would love to see a return of the responders faction.
---
After the responders pop up then some within their ranks start up the MoM again and it spreads to some of the ladies in crater, foundation, maybe even someone within BoS. 
---
Have the secret organization have their connections in all the factions.
---
You get 8 treasury notes and there's 3 wendigo plans, that's honestly about it. The 'cursed' items seem gash as there's not a lot of variety, I've seen like 15 of the same rolls on the cursed pickaxe for example.
---
Yeah you know how games now have paid alpha and beta access. 
---
That. That‚Äôs basically what they‚Äôre doing now. We‚Äôre all already the testers, we just have to pay to do it.
---
&gt; For how much money people pay for these items, its terrible how many bugs and issues slip through.
---
I really, really, really wish people would understand that they are rewarding Bethesda for releasing poor quality stuff. There is absolutely zero incentive for Bethesda to make quality stuff to release in the Atom Shop. Half ass things and release buggy stuff and make money, or spend actual time and effort to release non-buggy stuff and make the same amount of money? The choice is pretty clear, right? 
---
I can't recall an Atomic Shop release that was bug free, ever. I'm sure there have been some, but it feels like it's been a long while. It doesn't seem to dissuade or discourage people from buying the next time around. It's disheartening to see Bethesda put so little effort into what is realistically their main revenue generator. I can only imagine there's just 3 interns working on the actual game itself. :D
---
Sure buddy. I specifically said ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù.
---
But sure, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äúnot specific enough‚Äù.
---
Ok buddy, you win.
---
And it seems a lot of that is in beer... I struggle to stay under 300/300, what are you carrying, one small knife?
---
It feels quicker than SBQ but no improved repair kits
---
It's not just the weight of the weapons, you can get 90%RW weapons, it's ballistic ammo and energy ammo now that you need to lug around. And if you get bear arms, then you lose either Blocker, or Traveling Pharmacy if you wear PA, and Blocker / Barbarian if you do Regular Armor. Bear Arms is a wasted Talent I find.
---
The main thing that needs adjusting is how high they fly sometimes, where its impossible to actually hit them, end up chasing them for miles until they fly towards a mountain or something high you can climb.
---
I mean the plans are some what cool that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm going to try to get once it‚Äôs out for consoles
---
Weird, my first drop was the heads, and my second was the helmet lol. I just want the plushie!
---
see my tl;dr section.
---
you weren't very specific.
---
This is‚Äôt robbing you of a reason to travel though.  It is limiting the amount of time you spend on loading screens not playing the game
---
Indeed. With the Free States Scorched tracking system in wide deployment, with their sonic lures drawing Scorchbeasts in for the kill, with Scribe Takano's sonic tracking system and genetic research plans, with the Responders providing infrastructure, food and medical supplies and a literal cure/vaccine for the plague, with the BOS fully supplied and free to act on the available information...well, they very well might have pulled it off.
---
But, as Benjamin Franklin once said " "We must all hang together, or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately."
---
No it won't, it's been proven things are more or less the same it's just that everything is getting nerfed so everything will be weaker but bloodied and junkie are still the top weapon classes.
---
if i go to this and no one attacks the boss, im just going to leave. no use wasting my ammo and dmg'ing my armor just for some randos to collect screws
---
Is this on consoles yet? I've been seeing a lot of posts about it and thought it was delayed.
---
Oh, it was. I signed up for a month to check it out and this was one of my goals. There's no way I would have been able to do this on an open server. Haha.
---
Aye, tis a crushing responsibility they would think to assume.  Though I cannot let you be overburdened by this either, good sir.  I shall gladly take on this task in your stead.
---
mmmmmmmmm sake
---
Remember when everyone was like ‚Äúdelays are good because it means a Bethesda while patch out all the bugs‚Äù lol
---
Actually found out you dont drop your junk if you die during the fight!
---
I've never used Nukashine much really. How long does nukashine last until you blackout? Can you trigger a blackout prematurely by drinking a different alcohol? How long is the escape timer?
---
I think its all the crashes and black screens from FT'ing thats the issue
---
Negatory, I want everyone to communicate completely in emotes like uncivilized wild children.
---
Level 367 been a pa heavy for all of it. I run bear arms, bandilor, and batters included. I have 0 problem with any of the games content and shread everything.
---
Barbarian is a huge waste of points with how Dr works in this game. Traveling pharmacy, easy don't carry chems. Blocker, kill stuff before it hits you.
---
Rw on weigh pons doesn't effect weapons once you mod them, so a mini gun with rw and a tri barrel still weights 18 pounds, a modded gat plasma with rw weights about 17.and rw lmg weight 8.8. Rw is not that helpful.
---
Explosive minigun shreds it before it can start hauling ass. Also have a two shot missile launcher with a tracker that works really well as it will usually down it in one trigger pull. If it ever doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs 100% crippled so the second pull will take it out. Tracker helps if it‚Äôs already hauling ass when you find it.
---
76 is a metaphorical Power Cycle 1000.
---
I always felt things like basic paint skins, color variants of camp items, bundles etc. should always be available from the shop tbh. I get the marketing strategy, believe me.. but as a player it would be nice to have a small basic catalogue of stuff that never leaves, and still have weekly or daily sales on things. I missed a few basic things in the beginning and was so sour when I had to wait a long ass time to get ‚Äòbasic PA paint jobs‚Äù
---
'Meat pile' is not a plan I'll ever want.  Gross.
---
;)
---
Agreed. I think the most expensive thing I've ever sold was for 20 caps. I feel like NPC vendors rip us off enough. We don't need to do it to each other, too.
---
"We're all in this together."
---
Colossal problem is only on pc 
---
Not on consoles yet for testing
---
If you're on pc Id be happy to pay you for one.
---
Stack intelligence and xp boosting items/chems/equipment/mutations, and go do the Radiation Rumble event or Line In The Sand (especially if someone triggers the spawn grouping bug). I got two levels out of a single event the other night on rad rumble, and I'm in the lvl 240's.
---
Reminds me of the Cow from Kung Pow! Enter the Fist
---
Also if you're carrying a rifle or pistol as backup you still have to cary ammo for it, a gattling gun uses 5mm a super light ammo. So not sure what your point is
---
I do not feel that this on its own; however, is a meaningful answer. 
---
The fact that some users may be compelled to purchase out of fear cannot easily be evaluated against how many sales are lost due to products that are not available for purchase.
---
This is particularly the case with a game that many players play for some time, then quit and never return.
---
I know of three such players, not including myself, who left the game with unspent Atoms who were at one time frustrated with the Atom shop vaulting. Now they will never spend those or buy more because it is too late.
---
The only other players (two) that I know personally who still play, also have unspent Atoms, and can't buy the things they want.
---
This is the meaning of "I'm not the only one"; therefore, I'm speaking from my perspective and about the only cases I have first hand knowledge of. I can't speak for others who buy for reasons that I cannot understand.
---
It is probably very difficult, if not impossible, to measure lost sales, so they will never know if this was the best way to make money.
---
Supply and demand economics collapse without supply, as far as I can understand.
---
Remove the wallpaper and you can get it. Had to do the same thing.
---
thanks alot dude it worked
---
Only on PC at this point.  So far there are some issues they will need to address so it might be a few days.
---
It is sold by the vendor bot in Grafton station.
---
Yo I share the exact same sentiment
---
Only on PC right now
---
Overseers basement makes the most sense since you turn in photo op there
---
Oh thank u üëå
---
u can get 3 legendaries from that event. 1from wentigo ,1 from crate  (cursed weapon), 1 at end of the event, total random drop 3star. Also u dont need to loot at end that crate for cursed weapon, it ll add in your inventory after the event ends(btw its not always guarantee drop but its very high chance to get them)
---
Aleays forget that's a thing, but that would be nice too yeah.
---
Turning off voice chat was literally the first thing i did when spawning outside vault 76 for the first time. At no time will it ever be turned back on.
---
And i have an amazing mic fwiw. But fallout always has been and always will be a single player game for me.
---
I meant the ability to follow what exactly was going on would have been easier with NPCs because they literally tell you that you need to do this for that, see me other comment for more on this since you replied to every single individual comment I made.
---
You can also place the silo inside of it fwiw
---
Basically. The idea was to have a player pool that could be more easily consistent, private players can launch their nukes and public players can and have the opportunity to fight a monster that matches that difficulty lvl vs SBQ where you could have 1 player or 20 and it‚Äôd be the difference between an incomplete event or not getting a shit on any mobs. 
---
Still needs a TON of work, but the limited number is to curate a better boss fight.
---
Hahah yeah or Not-so-fuzzy Brenda lol
---
Exactly this. Season 1 was Captain Cosmos, a pre-War radio/TV show, and while we've never seen "Armor Ace" before, it seems probable it's the same sort of idea - a pre-War TV show or comics, probably similar to the likes of GI Joe. And, of course, with the pre-War world being so paranoid about China and communism, *of course* their GI Joe parallel would be fighting communist super-villains.
---
That's really a great point. Getting people started on the basics might also get them to check back for more.  As it is, there are no skins or paints for the items I have at default, so I just don't even look. I just got used to leaving things the way they were.
---
The amount of communist stuff that‚Äôs always available drives me nuts, not everyone wants to be a commie, where‚Äôs the USA stuff?
---
I think if they gave us 60 seconds to loot before the wall breaks to allow our escape would be a nice middle ground. Keeps you on your toes but still let's you grab those sweet sweet screws from the spawn.
---
This, this should be a dialog option when talking to Maggie. Pure gold! :D
---
Yeah, have you tried hitting the icon only to get the ft-bug?
---
Let me tell you, it's no fun and the opposite of easy.
---
The small purifier (the one that works on dirt) is learned by taking over a workshop.  The plan is also sold by Grahm and the Responder Vendortrons (for around 250 caps).
---
This is a link to a spreadsheet with the location of all plans:

It's obvious they don't want to keep doing atom dailies so we should just get used to that fact. That said after level 100 you really should get *something* for completing the dailies or they're just pointless and wont be getting anyone to log in just to complete them.
---
Ehhhhh the only problem with this is they now think you actually want half the useless junk they put on there, so they‚Äôll keep adding useless junk.
---
200 caps for the outfit and hat is what I sell them for. They move pretty quickly. 
---
Cheap to make as well
---
That could make for a fun vats build if it did. Still wouldn‚Äôt be the best, but at least it‚Äôd be useful
---
Chamelion mutation and just sit on top of the claim bench pole using marsupial mutation. When they get close shoot them. When they come back move a bit.
---
Repair kits FTW!
---
I‚Äôve been saying this for over a month now. I use to find it everywhere. I would usually just sell it to vendors being I would have so much. I had 30 over a month ago and I went to turn it in and I did and that was the last time I could. Because I waited until the next day to see if it would let me drop the rest. But no so I sold the last 15 I had to vendor and since then I can not and have not found any since. Everyone kept saying I didn‚Äôt do something right or I had to find it at whitesprings but I know where I found it at and I know what it is but for over a month I have. It found a single piece
---
I wish I could but they‚Äôre lamps
---
Wish there was a broom camp item
---
I hear that! 
---
If they increased the CAMP budget and stash size, I would definitely want a lot more stuff. 
---
As it is, there's hardly any CAMP items I would buy because I would have to scrap current paid items to use them.
---
There could be a dope PVP minigame/quest with 5 or so people being a Mistress with extra dmg resists or something, then they have to take out 20 player controlled raiders.  So.ething along those lines.
---
So much this. I leave my tent outside foundation because I have to fast travel there so much for this.
---
Can someone link the next legendary run rewards?
---
Graphics settings? I play on PC, so you might have lower graphics settings if you play on console
---
Why‚Äôs he gotta be so angry? Lol
---
Better solution is use a painting of a similar size
---
It feels like it was bigger at one point and they scaled it down and we got all these problems with it
---
Someone posted that communist has the most of any faction content. It's not even a faction you can join.
---
I don't want any of that crap at my CAMP either.
---
As a "communist military safe" you think they would have atleast put a red star (or stars) on it, but instead it's just a green metal box.
---
The rocks drop so people can't jetpack out and skip the whole escape part. Ditto for the death at the end, so people don't suicide to escape.
---
Ok cool, is there a special mechanic for killing the boss? (like encryptid)?
---
I tried twice so far, second time he didn't even get low enough to reset.
---
I have standard 3 star legendary weapons from drops
---
I thoroughly enjoy this game. I, too check this sub, but not nearly as much as I play the game. 
---
I‚Äôm a 66-yo female gamer since Atari. I was turned on to this game by my daughter (Fallout franchise, 4 being my introduction) and loved the graphics and questlines. FO76 is RPG and multiplayer online. That means, play as you wish. Do what you want. I didn‚Äôt play for a week or so, only to discover I missed most, if not all, the building and rewards for BoS at Atlas. Oh well. Life got in the way. I‚Äôm sure there will be more "stuff" available that I can‚Äôt use in the game because of my camp budget. I wait around until it‚Äôs back in the Atomic Shop at a reduced price.
---
Don‚Äôt want to grind? Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt want to play? Don‚Äôt.
---
I mean the actual mirror disco ball - will those hang from the roof of the bunker? You could hang a bunch of those...maybe put the lamp below it.
---
I did 5 events total yesterday, all downing Earl. I only had once instance where I died at the end and was spawned outside.  On my 5th, we killed Earl, I was able to loot the body, but nothing ever popped up about completing the event with the items that you got nor did I receive any loot other than what I was able to grab off the body. Was kinda pissed.
---
Because players duped countless hacked and broken weapons?
---
Alright well I have level 3 Serendipty and Emergency Protocols (if I bust out my Sex-01). I did some research and a bloodied tank heavy is one of the best builds according to AngryTurtle who is a professional at this game.
---
No. This is just empty pure greed.
---
And the Fixer too... It can't be that hard to make weapon skins for every weapon, so they are throwing money away.
---
Guess this shit is easy to get. Would‚Äôve thought it would be way more difficult being everything else. I fought queen twice last night and colossus 3 times and best I got was 3 star chameleon marine armor leg everything else was crappy 2 star berserker weapons. Guess I‚Äôll get to see if they ever make it go live on console
---
We'll probably see something in a season or 2, it's unlikely to be quick as it's free rewards.
---
[](/abrelax)Y'know, I passed a group of lvl 600+ dudes today at a colossal problem, they sounded like they were retired, and just having a blast with the new update, they were spitting jokes, and waxing about what they had done in game that day, and it didn't seem at all out of the ordinary.  
---
The actual people playing the game seem to usually be having a blast. They don't overlook the issues, but they work around them to have all the fun they can.  
---
This game might have the highest concentration of optimists per capita of any live service game I've ever played.  
---
Suppose that's why I've found a surprising number of people who are practicing Dudeists in game. No joke. I wonder if that's why they added White Russians to the game. :P
---
Agree, at a minimum they should extend the exit timer.
---
Exactly! I always have American flags hanging on the walls inside my CAMP, all we got for America was the little 4th of July bundle they released but that was it. Really makes no sense to me that they don‚Äôt rotate different items weekly
---
\+ excavator armor
---
Ah I see. Thank you
---
Daily quest: donate 250 steel, concrete and cork
---
Last time I was killed at a workshop I was blown 30 yards and melted before I hit the ground.  I never even saw her, but I believe she was using a gatling laser. She was the highest level player I'd encountered (683) until yesterday doing the colossal problem (707).
---
Its called Exclusivity , humans like this , like to feel special , car companies these days makes loads and loads of special limited editions with little changes other than unique badges , and guess what ? They sell alot for way more than its worth
---
Someone hasn‚Äôt been to point pleasant
---
I completely missed looting the boss, couldn't find the body and our rag-tag team had to run like hell to get out of there. It was a fun event but, yes, either give us some time to explore before the mine starts to collapse or auto loot the boss.
---
Youre following the events after the fact and putting them out of place. You have to put yourself into your character snd see how you would think about it when you come out of the vault. You know shit about fuck. You see the Scorched at the farm and you're like what the fuck but you move on. Find the responders which you never thought would be there because you're supposed to reclaim Appalachia and be the first ones there, so then you go to the airport and find out that the responders were killed by the scorched, you see a scorch beast for the first time, and you wanna know where the scorched come from. You find out the plague spreads like a disease and they were working on a vaccine, you being a perfect human specimen, figure out how to get it to work. You follow the chain of events through all the responders, that leads you to Hank Madigan and he talks about the Free States and you follow that and learn what they were working on which is the detection system. Its already a wall of text so I'm gonna summarize a bit. If all of the residents had worked together to deal with the scorched, instead of separately, they probably could've figured it out. They were all doing their own thing. I didnt mean you were specifically trying to find the Queens nest, you were trying to find the source which ended up being the Queen. I think you're putting too much thought into something that obviously ended up not working anyway so its useless but your character at the point probably would not have thought it was useless. Its a lot of you being in the role but it just didn't work out as well because it doesn't hold your hand like the other games.
---
I usually tend to find it in level 3 safes that I farm daily. My last trip to sugar grove only got me 1 piece though
---
Have you considered people may not want to waste minutes on one goddamn boss?
---
Very good points. Bethesda's fix will be to remove the event instead of tweaking and adjusting things.
---
LOL... gamers are the epitome of wanting their cake and eating it too.
---
Thats what I meant I have no idea how I managed to type the other thing out
---
This game was definitely built for sub-communities. RP, building, grinding. I think Bethesda intentionally doesn‚Äôt release larger content updates cause they would rather appeal to the small playerbases that can continue to produce their own enjoyment with less. It‚Äôs a shame they aren‚Äôt pushing for more than that, but seems to keep the lights on. They need to fix bugs more oftentimes though if they want that to work. It‚Äôs going to kill them long-term.
---
No.
---
heres my experience:  1sts fight zero death 100% success no bugs, 2nd fight one death 5 seconds from end and spawned me outside mine(got quest rewards but couldnt go back in to loot wendigo), 3rd fight died three times(spawned me inside mine all 3 times so i was able to rejoin the fight)
---
Nope! When you join the actual event from the map it spawns you inside, away from nuke zone danger! ....you just have to now face OTHER dangers! :D
---
Watoga HS usually had some
---
I agree, that‚Äôs a bad ass mask holy crap
---
And Scrapboxes!
---
Yes you can! It's probably my favorite piece of apparel in 76
---
Could be wrong, but pretty sure it won‚Äôt be fixed till later this week when colossal problem releases
---
I realize it may not be feasible at lower levels/less tanky builds, but we were just commenting last night during the event that you‚Äôre better off not rushing through this one. There‚Äôs really no reason not to loot the wendigos along the way (especially with their targeted ammo drops), and as long as you don‚Äôt sit in one spot too long, you can take down Earl at a leisurely pace while farming the spawns for XP/mats.
---
The Santa scorched has coats and we‚Äôll probably be getting those again
---
It's not bad as long as you have a few players with optimized DPS builds. Completed two runs with no problem and only used 6 plasma cores for my explosive plasma gatling and 500 or so 5mm. Struggled like crazy on the 3rd attempt because of that issue. All depends on if you have some optimized veteran players with you or a bunch of rookies
---
Well the mini gun has a vault tech paint, don't think the shotgun has one so might want to main that one haha
---
Exactly One Tamriel was extremely stupid and I fear One Wasteland won‚Äôt be any better.  If your build isn ‚Äòt perfect or your gear is off you should still be able to kill ants or bee swarms.  By scaling these kinds of enemies you just increase grind.
---
Can confirm. I went there over the weekend trying to get some plastic (didn't find any lol thought I got a load of it before but this time there wasn't any) and got at least 4 technicals
---
nah its just bullet sponge like SBQ but its a lot more cooler. At least hes not flying around 20mins and landing for 1min . hes easy to fight u can outrun him easily but the only things worst than him are infinite spawns of wertigos around and falling rocks randomly on players very often (theyre doing a lot of dps but if your armor is good enough u can easily outheal that damage with stimpaks even if u stay there on purpose)
---
Oh I think there is a clean (alternate) American flags reward you can buy with tadpole scout badges. It looks like there is a wall and standing version.
---
Yes, badges are very grindy.
---
The way of the Dude, is the only true way!
---
Besides the lamp.... lamp is LIFE.
---
Congrats! Luckily for me, it‚Äôs my birthday in game most of the time. October 26. I have never gotten a pie though
---
Combat shotgun does. I'll be shotgun for awhile before I unlock the minigun paint from Nuclear Winter.
---
LOL I just say my 'toon tripped. Fits me IRL too....oh dear...
---
The Fancy Shotgun is amazing.
---
It should set you back at the beginning again and let you collect only the non-unique rewards like caps, scrip, and lunch boxes again.
---
Yes you just lose other items placed inside in the process and if you're over budget wouldn't be able to rewire
---
Equip one gun army, shoot his legs till he just stands there and then farm the wendigos he spawns. We'll see that a lot more in the coming weeks as it's the best strategy for xp. It'll probably be nerfed soon.
---
Could I support and kill wendigos and still get rewards?
---
I have both of those flags, just wish they would add more variety
---
Wow! Well, don't expect a fix until patch 22....if we're lucky.
---
$5 says they will pull the Collosus event soon and we won't see it for awhile.
---
Well, the order you described isn't exactly how things worked out for me.  I left the vault, went straight to the airport (it was just the direction I traveled) found all about the Responders, the Scorched, saw my first Scordbeast at the airport event, found out about the cure, went to the hospotal and made it.  All on the first day.  Between all the Resonder terminal entries and notes and whatnot at the airport, I was pretty much up to speed more or less instantly.  So, having most of the story skeleton available I then did just what you said, I set out to make sense of it all.
---
It's fun. Different. Bring lots of ammo.
---
Oh nice was not aware of that. It really depends on what you want more with your rp. I'd still say main the mini cuz I live heavys haha. Throw some vault tech pain ton your pa and rock it. But would also look good with vault tech armour and the shot gun haha. I see your issue
---
Yep, this.  Do the event, then go gardening...
---
Also, ffs, stop putting up brand new items "on sale" from the get-go. Nobody believes that bullshit and it only makes you look bad.
---
was, when, was... don't you run silos anymore?
---
Weird i usually had always minimum found ~20 a day but since 2 or 3 weeks zero,nada. I dont know why and im a loot junky who opens every container and looks under every stone. I mean i have all costumes and 5 PA skins from this but... ?
---
Can you milk me, Greg?
---
Upload the pic to imgur and then post the link, thats how most folk post pics in here
---
Yeah I'm sad that I can't get the liberty prime power armor paint I mean what's wrong with just keeping everything in the shop the worst that could happen would be that they get more money or am I just stupid
---
Guilty. I have the long hair, shades and use the bathrobe. And White Russians are always on my vendor. Abide.
---
That wasnt a win...
---
Maybe you got a participation trophy, but I definitely wouldnt call that a win..
---
I dont think this sub gives the game enough credit. By no means is it a masterpiece, but the way it completely turned itself around with Wastelanders is incredible.
---
It's not about number of players, it's about using their new instancing mechanic in relation to a big boss fight with a lot of new mechanics.
---
Once you actually do the quest, you'll see there's a lot going on and it feels very different than anything else you've experienced, not just in 76 but even compared to 4 and Skyrim. 
---
There's just a lot of moving parts and from the backend that means a lot of scripts.
---
My shotgun character doesn't. When I tried to kill one with her, I broke 3 shotguns and, started picking up random rifles from supernatants. The random rifles worked better than the shot guns even without Perks.
---
perhaps you should read my opponent who openly gave me the win.  YOU can have the participation trophy for not really bringing anyrhing to the table. nice try, though.
---
That was my new game mode as of this week. A level 18 joined our public team all 400+. I always drop these guys/gals some level 15 and 20 stuff. Turns out he has a microphone, was friendly, and had the balls to hold it down at queen fight with a single shot rifle. So I said if wanted to I would walk through the game with him as I have only done it once and would love to play it again (with all my stuff). I scored him a magic shotgun and a level 25 2 shot handmade and have been enjoying leveling him up. We got stuck on Ra-Ra so that sucked. But it's been fun just running along as back up.
---
Yup, the walking penis with eyes, lol.
---
Nay, please dear god give me this burden. I‚Äôll never have enough budget space.
---
Beth should shift the focus from red to green next time.
---
Yep, kinda of blah on leather, ok on metal, good on combat armor, and great on the T series PAs and the X-01 (no Excavator, SS, or Raider). I've got all the various VT paints for weapons/armor unlocked except the Mini... I really need a double XP week to work on NW levels.
---
&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if the next faction introduced was the bloody NCR at this point.
---
North Carolina Republic, checking in! 
---
Why are all of our items western-themed? Because we're "west" of North Carolina, obviously. And don't mind the two-headed bear on our flag - that's just because there are two Carolinas, and bears are cool.
---
We're here in West Virginia to fight Kaiser's Brigade, and to secure Grafton Dam from the wily capitalist claws of Mr. Condo.
---
As a total anti social bastard .. I endorse this message
---
I am desperate for any morsel of content related to the Order.
---
who's 'he'?
---
thank you OP. someone finally says it!!!!
---
i have yet to play this new event (i am on Xbox), i have read about the spawning bug which is understandably annoying. But when i read peoples comments about it being a "bullet-sponge" i scratch my head and say "you complain about the game being too easy and predictable, so why not be happy that you finally have a boss that can't be one shot" i am looking forward to this event and seeing how long it takes. i have gone to so many SBQ fights where i am lucky to get a few shots on her till some ass hat shows up and takes her down before i can finish reloading my gun and that's with her health being at least at 50%
---
I can agree that rare things can be valuable, and can understand about some being motivated by exclusivity. I guess that I can't relate to buying something for a badge or exclusivity myself, and certainly not when it comes to something as limited in utility or overall life impact as an in game outfit.
---
PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE! (of bad content)
---
The FOMO is stronger with discount items. Most of us aren‚Äôt going to be a ton of atoms, but when we know the item will return we aren‚Äôt going to be in a hurry to spend real money for it when we know it‚Äôs returning, just be annoyed we have to wait. If we know we can get it for cheaper tho, then players are at least convinced Bethesda is giving them a good deal.
---
Il still want it once it's fixed though :/
---
Season ends Sept 8
---
How's the game been? I stopped playing right before season 1 ended.
---
Bold of you to assume Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want people to waste atoms
---
Youre supposed to go to Flatwoods first, learn about the responders, and register for responder training and then you learn where the airport is through that. To sum the story up, in my opinion, you learn that nothing they did worked(if it had, they'd still be alive) and that the only person who stopped the spread of the scorched was you because you found the only solution which was the nuclear option. The responders were not proactive about it at all except for Hank who tried to help the Free States by going to the TotW and getting killed by the Raiders so they couldn't use the scorched detection system that would've allowed them to use their lures. The Brotherhood tried to brute force it with sheer numbers and that didn't work.
---
Probably my biggest complaint about this FO76 is the lag on the weapons wheel...the so called "fast wheel." I have died countless times from trying to switch weapons an become paralyzed.  I can deal with just about anything else.
---
I wasn't playing when this came out so I missed it. I would buy it today if it was in the shop, but they don't want my money.
---
I'm in the same boat. Built a stealth rifleman... and don't like him. So converting to commando. Im lvl 95 and still don't have all the cards I want lol.
---
People are also complaining about the shit rewards. Queen rewards are meh, Earle rewards are somehow even worse. None of the, currently two, boss fights feel in any way rewarding.
---
Add the nerf on top of that and you know why people are a bit agitated about all of this.
---
Those I'm leaving post ate funny because they are basically told don't let the door hit you on the way out. Normally I come back to find they deleted their post.
---
This could actually benefit Bethesda, as some people would spend more Atoms to Rank Up so they can start getting these 'prizes' instead
---
In other words, you want a corporation to change their marketing strategy to suit your *personal preferences*.  I think that‚Äôs a windmill you won‚Äôt be able to tilt. 
---
You also seem to be ignoring the discounts they offer on items that *return* to the shop. In other words, those that are able to resist their FOMO get better deals. 
---
I just bought the Clean Fridge at a discount, *because I didn‚Äôt succumb to FOMO months ago*. Another example: The Raider Waster Bundle is **30% off**, a savings of 540 Atoms. 
---
There‚Äôs two sides to the coin. And the wise and patient player will save Atoms. 
---
There is a price for speed and convenience. There is savings is being patient. 
---
Look at it as the difference between buying a gallon of milk at the convenience store at 11 pm because you ran out and will need milk for the kid‚Äôs cereal in the morning, and buying that a gallon of milk at the market and having a coupon. 
---
Need/Want it **RIGHT NOW**?  You‚Äôll probably pay a premium. 
---
Willing to wait and be patient?  You‚Äôll probably save some money. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to critique their marketing strategy, do it in context of the whole, not just the one part you don‚Äôt like.
---
YES! Dealing with the small bad for the greater good! Excellent angle!
---
Same here, I had a decent inventory of legendary weapons (I thought they were pretty decent at least, but I'm a casual gamer) priced at value..but only sold one in the past month. I've sold more maps, magazines, and bobbleheads than anything else. I'm totally fine with that bit it would be nice to move those legendary weapons too.
---
I remember when I first started playing I bought the ultracite jet pack plan for 3k caps from a vendor. The other day someone was selling the plan for only 74 caps. Pretty sure they were just being generous but that is a huge step from 3k.
---
I wasn't either but when I found out it existed I thought why would they get it out of the shop it's one of the coolest skins in the game if you ask me but now you just can't get it anymore
---
Of course they haven't, it awards Atoms. :(
---
and the spots that were unique rewards should also be replaced with bullion, scrip, caps, etc.
---
With the vast reduction of Atoms being given out from challenges now, I'm not sure that the current model is going to work all that well. Sales will more important than ever to most buyers unless prices overall come down a lot, imo.
---
You mean like the bunker that is under the cannery?
---
The effects are hardcoded and they included bash damage? Are they trolling?
---
Neither can i , but people are just like this sadly , this is the kind of world we are now
---
Flamer  ammo is cheap if you convert 2mm in to all points and then buy fuel from the ammo converter it's like 1:1  
---
1500 2mm for 1500 fuel 
---
And as 2mm is just lead and steel it's easy to farm for.
---
Check in Harper's Ferry,  I got 2 technical documents today.  Although the rewards were not that great.
---
Wastelanders was delayed hella long and why lol
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever said anywhere what happened to Frederick Rivers, and given how the Order questline played out, if he‚Äôs still alive, he‚Äôs got some dramatic potential, maybe rebuilding his wife‚Äôs legacy.
---
It's almost like their already here
---
They've already hinted about Chinese infiltrators....Jen's mother, for example, explicitly states that there are other Chinese assets in the US (and maybe even some still in Appalachia).
---
I mean, look at The Deep - that took quite a bit of work &amp; they had an in at Hornwright, since they had access to the Motherlode.
---
I have taken to having me or someone on my team place a FO1st tent (if able) near the FT point for Monongah. If one of us has to respawn, we can at least FT back to the event area and reap rewards. Also, FYI, you can FT to a survival tent in a nuke zone!
---
If the create post picture does not work you might want to upload it like to imgur etc and do an embedded link to it with text.
---
I had problems with this in another subs they probably updated policy here too.
---
Yea...or mabye a hidden bunker with a cool name by whitespring
---
Being bloody and unyielding helps me a bit but I die so easily its not funny. One unlucky hit by a level 5 enemy and i am dead im 189. It also doesnt help im melee with this build but I love the damage.
---
Ah shit yes thanks for that!
---
only pickaxe is usable
---
I have a mic, but I always thumbs down too.  I find it's a bit cumbersome to use a mic on console, plus, I'm not overly comfortable talking to strangers either.  Plus, there's not really a whole lot to say that would justify me sitting there for hours with a headset on...  Whilst that might just be a "me problem", I'm sure there are many others who feel the same way.  Not having text chat will forever baffle me.
---
In my first time one of those bullshit falling ember or rocks or whatever opened up right above it‚Äôs corpse, killing me and three other‚Äôs instantly. Barely any time to loot at all. The second time there were so many wendigos I panicked and missed the end crate even though I was looking for it, didn‚Äôt help that the fucking timer broke though.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs made it clear the point of this game was that there is no pure good or evil characters, including the players. The Overseer represents that throughout talking with her, you can‚Äôt get what you want without compromise. You can choose to be the ideal good guy, but I don‚Äôt think it makes a lot of sense that you wouldn‚Äôt have to sacrifice some of your morals when struggling to survive in the apocalypse
---
I sell mine at the cost on the card so 100 caps for the outfit and cap each.
---
I have yet to hear of anyone not getting a refund for the first time they have made the mistake
---
I'm willing to bet it'll be nerfed before the event hits consoles...
---
Upload image to third party image hosting page and link here.
---
The load screens are so long and frequent I constantly and jumping back and forth lol
---
I just did the math, and it looks like I will finish the Run on Sunday. 
---
Between that and Meat Week, it's gonna be a good weekend in Appalachia.
---
yap, the cursed harpoon gun u can use as wall decor
---
Sounds suspicious...
---
You know you never made it out, when it goes to black smoke you died but are spawned outside anyway. :-)
---
The one workshop that's almost never claimed is Mount Blair. Claim, hop, claim, hop... I knocked out the weekly in about a half hour yesterday. Might be worth a shot.
---
They‚Äôll probably let you keep it - I asked for a refund for the Nuka Dark power armor skin because I couldn‚Äôt put it on my Ultracite power armor despite it being advertised.
---
Pro tip- use the crossbow to make a perch somewhere they would never expect
---
A bloodied stepping in the nuke zone because the SBQ landed just in the edge of it, with no obvious boundaries telling you where the roads start increasing. I 100% feel your pain lol
---
Yeah, I feel like I got lucky and bought the free States bundle when it came out a couple months ago for my shotgun skin.
---
The Order of Mysteries were great but they certainly were not "femme fatales".
---
Just rename with a "-" or a "Zz" kind of thing. In my 400+ levels I have never scriped one of those.
---
Still waiting on my Captain Cosmos helmet I did this whole legendary run for.
---
I thought they were trying to make these drops ...you know...GOOD. Missed opportunity for a end game harpooner/shovel!
---
Yeah the spawns are the real issue in the event.  Earle is just as underwhelming as his non event bound counterparts, just with a lot more health, and no trees to block him or get him stuck.
---
Meanwhile, at no time have I done the event and not been being ganked, gangbanged, or chased by like 5-7 wendigo spawns constantly.  Even in PA, they stagger you pretty good, so getting surrounded by them ain't fun.
---
That said it's not a stim drainer like Encryptid unless you like standing in fire like me.  Once I added that to my awareness it was better.  Hot tip, the red sparks do not warn of danger, they are the danger.
---
I've had last laugh on my character from the beginning of NW, I had the same philosophy, if I die I'm taking someone with me. It's why I keep hold of the most dmg giving grenade I find
---
I just got kicked out of the game,  seemed also to be a bit laggy aswell while I was playing. I'm on Pc.
---
Need those.
---
Swapping out my character outfit for BoS style one and changing my camp to be a BoS outpost.
---
For the last month I've been playing with two friends...one who 76 is his first Fallout experience ever and the other who's been a casual fan since 3. We've been having an absolute blast and I'm super happy they're both enjoying the game so much. I enjoyed playing the game solo but having friends along for the ride has enhanced the game so much.
---
I just dealt with it on monday so unless they patched it tuesday its not fixed lol
---
Well done btw :-)
---
I feel dumb for asking but can someone explain where the trunk is? I‚Äôve done the event twice and didn‚Äôt realize there was one. I definitely agree with you too, this is the first boss event my character has been powerful enough to contribute and I didn‚Äôt even loot the boss at the end of the first one because I was frantic trying to find the exit of the mine.
---
I'm just expressing an opinion. I don't expect a corporation to do what I express unless a very large number of players express the same thing, as happens here in this sub sometimes.
---
One other point is that I don't, and I cannot play all the time. I may leave this game and not come back for eight months, just as I did before Wastelanders. 
---
Any of the items that appear and then disappear during that time are not available for me to buy when I return, and in fact, I'm not even aware that they ever existed. I cannot desire something that I have no awareness of.
---
On the other hand, if they were all in the store all the time, I wouldn't know what is there and what I want to buy. I could prioritize those purchases and buy the things that I want, some of which I would buy at full price, and others that I want less, I would wait to buy on sale, just like with how I shop in real life.
---
I can understand if they aren't catering to me. I'm just saying that they are missing out on some of my money.
---
Was thinking the same, a bit of an overkill seeing that we could use the Motherlode drill in the Settlers main quest. Top notch writing by Bethesda.
---
No unfortunately you don't get the xp , only the satisfaction you've stopped whoever died from it from gaining any more üòÅ
---
I do this for everything with my explosive shotgun
---
Behold, The convoluted thought processes of Bethesda. Did you know they all wear pointed aluminum hats during work?
---
This. The rewards are just not worth it.
---
They‚Äôve been very slowly reducing prices and upping artistic quality, but it‚Äôs only half the problem when their sales model isn‚Äôt working
---
Yeah, I've watched a few of the videos &amp; despite my distaste for Power Armor, it looks like my T-65 investment will pay off here. I'll see about adding the Stabilized perk (which I usually don't run, i.e. no power armor use) and go from there.
---
Us console folks hopefully will get our shot at this tomorrow (or Friday), and we'll see how it goes.
---
Woo Lode Baring! I just think that event is so under appreciated.
---
Why, Don't you think there's enough communist money financing their bank?
---
Generally speaking screws, springs, steel, wood, copper, circuits (energy weapons) are all used for weapon repair.
---
It would have been a really nice touch had they added a unique sound/animation with the safe. Like clicking mechanisms as the safe opened.
---
Not a bad weapon..
---
Is the event out?
---
I would assume that you die a lot as bloodied because that's the life of a glass tank.
---
I love it still. And new content coming...even if you do have to wait. And I have had two recent encounters with  a 3* Wendigo Colossus in the "nuke zone". Thats enough to hold me over until they figure it out.
---
Perhaps that scorched professor from hornwright is actually a communist infiltrator.
---
Oh I feel you my guy, it is so much better. I still think it‚Äôs hilarious, but also slightly like ‚ÄúCome on‚Äù in regards to the small things like the Commie bunker bundle is broken.
---
Are the new plans and cosmetics part of the event rewards, or are they loot drops (from Earl or the trunk)?
---
It may be a small loss of revenue from you and your team but you fall into the margins. They market they want has more money than you and is a larger portion of the population. Yes they lose a little from you and your buds but make way more from everyone else.
---
My GT is "Big Keebes" 
---
Just messaged you
---
That's where I get all my copper from :)
---
No, I shall volunteer as a tribut! *raises hand*
---
Thx! It was always a problem to mee since pts to find a way out of this mine!
---
Charleston Herald upstairs where the offices are, in the blue-ish round containers at the wall usually had one/two - did not check after the last patch but definitly picked one up at the weekend there.
---
This is just yet another example showing that Bethesda doesn't regularly play their own game.
---
You lingered too long looting, you were nearly there, a few more bends, then you pass the previously sealed room and can loot the bonus crate just before you leave the way you came in :-)
---
That FOMO isn't there just to drive sales..   
---
Fallout 76 has been quite the failure and as a result, amassed a pretty sad player count.  
---
And although sales are very important, there are many other metrics that people IN Bethesda might be looking at: Active players, returning players, monthly inactive players, etc.   
---
These metrics can matter for a variety of reasons, from people trying to save their own job to keeping an illusion of popularity around the game to attract new people.   
---
Now back to the store: these types of "luck"-based mechanics are designed to abuse the compulsive and obsessive behavior in your human brain.   
---
So for many people who find themselves with nothing to do on the average day, the question of what might be on the Atom store can be enough to get them to launch the game, which might be enough to get them to buy something, or if not, to PLAY and go from a potentially inactive player to active once again.  
---
Sales matter most, but not only.
---
I dont yet have enough bloodied weapons go bloodied other than screwing around on occasion so I run full strength. This is about the only thing that ever kills me.
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by
---
That‚Äôs all it is, to find the camera. If you already got the camera without doing the quest from the terminal it should just end once you find the tourist.
---
I love the smell of fresh  a s b e s t o s  in the morning.
---
My pleasure! :D
---
Haha I meant the division 2.
---
yeah lol, like were waiting for that event months and all \*rare\* weapons u can get are one of these. They should make some kind of cursed combat rifle or handmade and made the drop chance around 1%. when RNG doesnt work with those items
---
Event drops for me thus far.
---
Pretty much a bug. You can make the quest inactive in your pipboy. I‚Äôve got it on 2 characters still. I think it‚Äôs because you can get the quest from your personal terminal which is more or less only used for tadpole daily quests even though this quest falls under miscellaneous.
---
Two square inches of intact ALUMINUM FOIL
---
does she react now instead of a holotape?
---
I found the tourist but it didn‚Äôt end.
---
I know how to stack them without a blueprint, a blueprint is a blueprint, there‚Äôs no other way to know, plus if you saw my camp you‚Äôd understand.
---
I thought the drill is destroyed during the questline, no more using that.
---
Ok, I will do that. Thank you!
---
Shoot the legs and cripple that f***.
---
The higher your intelligence the better your chance at learning mods from weapons, good to have some berry mentats on you when you decide to craft and  scrap weapons.
---
Intelligence makes you gain 2% exp bonus per point as well(maxed at 40), this can be used to unlock pocketed mods early on for armor which will give you more carry weight.
---
Yeah my math has me ending Sunday as well, hoping that double score can shave a day off. So freaking ready to be done with the run!
---
I haven‚Äôt had that but I did have a spate of getting nothing but legendary broadsiders for about a week. Unfortunately none of them were very good
---
Why is it even an option, but no cores?
---
He is right, it is worth it to take over a workshop at least once to get this plan and several other defense related ones you can't buy.
---
Did you loot the body?
---
It dont have anything...
---
Shoot the rockets, The motors it uses to fly with. Cripple those and it'll become stationary.
---
Oh! Haha...i don't know. I honestly have not played any other games but FO76 since about April. But I been thinking about going back soon. They change so much on that game that you have to practically relearn it every time you return!
---
It wasn't stupid at all. The idea was got but the implementation was shit. I started a fresh character. First enemie was a skeleton. One of the weakest enemies in-game or the elder scrolls in general. I needed 5 hits to kill it. Made my way though the game, was max lvl got some gear from raids. I decided to went back to the skeleton just to see my hard earned gear working. 4 hits until the skeleton was dead. I was fully spect into magic. All into dmg and what ever. This was the moment I quit and delete the game. Why should I play a game where I can not feel any character progress lol
---
i was running it for a few weeks and it never worked. I tried every type of grenade nothing ever happened.
---
I have once your twice but then they shoot me, with big, big guns
---
"Finally someone with the guts to help"
---
Same.  I had no idea there was a trunk at the end.
---
Yah, trying to get radaway from that wheel before the nuke zone kills me is what gets me with the lag
---
This.  In theory, One Wasteland is a good thing, but how it's been executed (a sort of, one glove fits all change) is bad.  A dps nerf is sucky but can live with it.  A dps nerf coupled with inconsequential enemies being much higher level is... not so bearable, perhaps.  It's like a double damage nerf, kind of.
---
Bethesda... Come on... This is just fucking embarrassing...
---
Good luck, not that you'll likely need it, as magic most definitely works here.  But also be aware that some people have reported getting kicked from the event if they die.  Basically once the event starts you get locked in.  So of you cant respawn in the arena, you're not getting back in from the outside.
---
So dont die.  
---
That said I think it's the old respawn bug, but since you cant join the event after its started, it hits harder here.  Or so I've heard.  Still haven't died yet.
---
When in doubt, Nuke it out.
---
One thing I think they need to look at is making all current weekly atom store items have a .001% chance of dropping as event and daily quest rewards. Can you imagine how much more people would play those events and do dailies if there was even a small chance something cool would drop? Plus it‚Äôs good influencer advertising for those items in the atom store if a handful of people won them and use them in their camps. I know I buy a lot of atom store items after seeing how it actually looks in someone‚Äôs camp.
---
Make sure you do some damage to to Earl if you want to loot his corpse, keeping the wendigos off your ranged and big damage dealers will make the fight much easier for them. If your not worried about Earls loot, then yes, you can focus on support and still get the mission rewards upon success.
---
It‚Äôs a good place for it. It‚Äôs also just thematic and fun.
---
Well said. My first kill I did take a selfie with the corpse. On another run, on our way out, there was a crazy number of Wendigo Spawns so I had to stop and take a photo.
---
I did the event 6 times last night. No bugs, no deaths (for me anyway), average time for the event was 7 minutes with the slowest being 23 minutes and the fastest being under 1 minute (killled it in under 15 seconds).
---
Still on the hunt for the new gas mask.
---
I suppose you could interpret as a way of showing how Fallout's America will casually fling nukes at anything that gets in its way...
---
Or maybe I'm reading too much into it. Game mechanics!
---
We gripe about it so much *because* we love it. I just wanna see it flourish, Bethesda. Why?!
---
YES!
---
Haters gonna hate, sister.  FO76 is just a place to relax and enjoy. Graphics are awesome... and they haven't charged a damn thing for the updates and the DLC. I'm a level 203, and I've not scratched the surface. I love this game.
---
Ah yes, the American Method
---
I would have NUKED HIS AZZ
---
Not if you take Raiders into 79.
---
I‚Äôm leaving when my subscription runs out, but I‚Äôll keep the feed to see how things go and if I should toe in again.
---
As a game pass fo76er (played beta and oh boy) it erks me that the riot armour had the advanced and elite versions as well as the portable camps eariler with no way to get them. What do I get? A big Wanderer outfit and a shitty Valentine's bed... 
---
Every fallout 1st monthly item should be available for all 1st members no matter what or at the very least offer them for atoms to new 1st members
---
Look at that and tell me there‚Äôs a God
---
Covered in eldritch/cultist symbols.
---
issues?? in fallout 76?????? stop THE PRESSES!!!!!!!!!
---
I try this place later hopefully i get some
---
No it was more your lack of reading comprehension that lost you the war, or you replied to the wrong commentor, because you are on a different tangent that the duder you replied too..
---
a little secret. When you kill the boss u have like 1.5 or 2Mins to escape. Dont mind it, loot the boss , kill the wendigos repeatly for the screws over and over again until the mine collapses. when the timer runs out, u will be just teleported outside with everything what you have, also the cursed weapon (if it is in the end crate) you will get it added to your inventory right after the timer goes out
---
The 40% damage seemed like a flat 40 damage increase. This was dlme while not sneaking. And yes, I am fully specced for damage. Not bloodied or junkies. I was using an anti armor lv 50 handmade( semi)
---
I'll check the crate next time, thx for the info,pal)
---
What a fucking joke. Come on Bethesda...
---
Thanks a bunch
---
OH! I want faction WAR! 
---
Enclave vs BOS; Commies;
---
Commies vs BOS; Enclave;
---
BOS vs Enclave; Commies;
---
No, I meant I want an actual questline. I don't like play pretend.
---
I think you may be confused. I'm quite on point with whom I reply *to*.
---
I hate how legendary kills are. Everything else supply wise fine but legendaries should go to your inventory immediately like an event. Half the legendaries I kill either vanish or can't find them. Not even the camera trick works every time.
---
Work on Excavator Armor too ?
---
People want everything to be bland and the same it seems, anyone with more power or a different build gets their goat, jealousy I think.
---
Give me a  shout when you about to nuke it, I would enjoy a run with you.
---
No we need a cult faction. Praise mothman!
---
That's neat, thank you!
---
It will send me (PC) to loading screen and I'll be loaded back to where I was standing when I hit travel or it just won't do anything when I click fast travel to event. I did the event 3 times yesterday and the travel was obnoxious on two
---
15k a 1* B HM???
---
I feel sorry for the world you live in duder, hope things pick up for ya.
---
I never opened 76 through steam as I just use the Bethesda launcher, but I‚Äôm curious how many of the sales are unopened copies that people resell or hold onto to resell
---
same goes for you, considering we live in the same world. all the best "duder".
---
I just have to point out, naming a slight argument in a comments section (THAT DIDN'T EVEN LAST 5 MINUTES) a war is pretty stupid. 
---
actually, considering that, i feel sorry for your brain :/
---
I did not know that!  Lots more gear flexibility.
---
On the weapon side yes, on the enemy side you are seeing higher hp , higher armor values, and if bloodied and junkies doesnt one shot anymore then armor matters in damage calc.
---
It's been a grind and a half, and I am looking forward to playing more causally for a few days when I'm done, but I have to admit that the Run has been a lot of fun to do, and I'm excited for Season 2.
---
Why people whine about what others do in the game, PVP excluded, is beyond me. and why Bethesda always seems to listen to the squeaky wheels is also beyond understanding. Seems to be the way of the world, the small loud minorities on social media are changing everything just by crying and screaming the loudest.
---
Maybe there has been a misunderstanding.
---
I did not say I didn't have money to spend, exactly the opposite. I'm here expressing frustration that there isn't more on the Atomic shop for me to spend money on, because much of the content is currently hidden. 
---
For this reason, I'm spending my money elsewhere, so they are losing that money.
---
I found this to be the case also. Two of us took our time with it and it really is a fun run. 
---
I agree about making the end timer a bit longer though. Would be nice to explore a little instead of just dying. lol
---
That bunker is just a mess, it seems that the bunker is made from assets of different projects put together at the last minute, I would love for them to just erase it and start over and do a proper one..
---
Ok my god
---
Oh definitely. I liked it a lot more than I expected, it‚Äôll definitely be nice to have a month away from the grind though :)
---
everything in those videos is setup to speedrun the queen, though. like sneak, the multiplier won't trigger in most cases because the queen is gonna be fighting something/someone else.
---
I actually bought 1st thinking you got the advanced/elite versions and paints after each month passed. I made sure to ask after buying the 1st month and was like "wow get fucked bethesda not giving you that sub again".
---
This is  a great idea. most players that have finished the legendary run have been complaining that they feel like there isnt much to do so why log in anymore. This would help alleviate that i think.
---
I don't think that effect exists on those weapons.  I think I heard before that someone had gotten a black powder weapon with the double effect but I never confirmed that and that effect is now legacy anyways.
---
Also you can only post omce a week due to server issues
---
I've now dropped a few nukes on the mine and ended up in an empty event room, I just wasn't fast enough getting out of the silo what with the fast travel bug and loading screen times.
---
Fast travelled back to camp and harvested some weed to make a fatty joint.
---
i just ran it on the PTS with 6 other guys,  all 300+ both high and low health, big guns, little guns legacies, the whole deal...
---
... and it was shit. bullet sponge, not hard, just dump bullets into spongy boss, and spongy mobs. GOD help you if some level 40s show up and take the slots.
---
on the live servers its not too bad, but with the damage calculation changes, its absolutely awful.
---
You're not alone, I haven't played the game in weeks.
---
It still works on heavy guns with the legendary effect explosive. It doesn‚Äôt work on guns that fire explosives, ex. Grenade launcher and Fat Man.
---
Very nice! I had a bunch of chairs and plants in mine ready for that light when I finish the legendary run this week
---
heh, wait until you meet the lvl 100 cave crickets.
---
Yup, although I think the brotherhood faction showing up soon won‚Äôt be like the Appalachia Chapter. Maybe the goals have shifted since then?
---
Right next to the entrance. When you first go in it will be an [INACCESSIBLE] door that when you start escaping explodes off the the hinge (and most of the wall with it). It will be to the right of the exit.
---
Not to this post. I'm not sure how to track dev responses.
---
Of course it is. They are a min max example of what is possible. They are also a perfect example of the fact that you don‚Äôt need exploits to kill the queen fast. These builds wouldn‚Äôt do less damage in a public server. They would be just as lethal, it‚Äôs just that the queen may not behave properly to allow for a super fast kill.
---
You can't get black powered weapons with quad sadly
---
IT
---
JUST
---
WORKS!
---
That is pretty much exactly what I wanted to hear. I also use a anti armor explosive handmade for about 110 damage in pipboy.  Your 50 damage seems a bit low actually,but still if it's a flat pure 40% maybe it's worth using.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
This makes me wonder what is the true 'canon' fate of the Motherlode.
---
I subscribe to the theory that it‚Äôs all a simulation, so I roleplay my character as someone who‚Äôs just in it for the aim practice.
---
I ended up going full raider so it was no problem for me anyway, of the two factions I dislike the Foundation the most I don't like the NPCs voice lines, I do enjoy the raiders though, more edgy.
---
You stated up top sometimes you don't have have extra spending money. That's not who they are after. They want people who always have extra money. It's really that simple. Your not the demographic this approach works on. And your not the one they are after.
---
1. Anythings possible for a Possible
---
2. If you're using heavys you should use pa. Stabilzed gives about a 25% damage boost
---
3. Pack all the ammo you can, 4k sounds a bit low to me, but I carry 30k for multiple weapons
---
4. Shoot for the heads
---
I'm a 129 level bloodied with all the perks and a 50 cal and i  died countless times. I even have full ss armor all buttressed. Bloodied builds are at a disadvantage in this event health wise because we can't just melt the colossus
---
Only reason I still play is cause of how nice people are. It‚Äôs a good substitute for the social interaction the ‚Äòrona took from me.
---
Ummm. You all do realize this isn‚Äôt real right?
---
Yes! BUT...when you leave it does barf you back out into a nuke zone! I had plenty of time to slap on power armor, and if you hot wheel your Chinese Stealth Suit or a HazMat suit its even faster!
---
Thanks! I will. üëç
---
Huh. I did it (bloodied hw/explo/PA build) with like 1 other guy who was spamming mini nukes on the PTS, so with the damage nerf. We downed him although yeah, it did take a ton of ammo. But that was just 2 of us and mini nukes are not efficient dps.... they helped a little with adds I guess?
---
Do you have the mod in your personal inventory or in your stash? It‚Äôs got to be on you while in the crafting menu. Also make sure it didn‚Äôt get auto scrapped. I‚Äôve had mods do that from time to time.
---
I wish I could find the post to prove my point, but it‚Äôs probably buried in reddit at this point.
---
Can chainsaws or rippers even drop as legendary? I think I've only seen maybe three regular rippers the damn things are so rare.
---
I wanted to go shotguns but have ended up using handmades of various flavours on my three playable characters that are not just mules. With commando perks and a bloodied build, full agility and 5 unyielding the game is fast and furious.
---
Why? Theres nothing wrong with this idea especially since theres no point to completing dailies after 100.
---
Also, it closes the way too soon, or is it a defect?
---
it's the agenda for some in this sub to just create toxic posts and for bandwagon hate brigades to get their jollies off upvoting them and downvoting anyone with the opposite opinion. Want good news posts? This ain't the sub for that.
---
I got one from there the other day first try, felt bad because a guy was in there before me and tried like 6 times before giving up and decided to try. Second one I've gotten from there.
---
Its like the  secret armoury of general knox all over again(kill boss, get in loot room and a short timer until the building collapses). Pretty sure it‚Äôs intentional so that you can‚Äôt get it too easy when you do it, you know for the server hoppers who look to farm these events.
---
Additionally, make under armor variants of some outfits 
---
(Sometimes, but not too often, I wish I could see armor on the outside of an outfit)
---
does that mean my two-shot The Dragon is worth selling? Or should I just keep it as a sort of museum piece?
---
Aside from checking the boss for legendary loot, you might as well just die. 
---
It sends the rewards you‚Äôre after + a purveyor roll straight to your inventory. All looting the end chest does is give some extra caps. 
---
Of course, if you‚Äôre there for screws you‚Äôre going to want to bail so you don‚Äôt lose those.
---
Yah, I wish they fleshed out the settlers better. It‚Äôs hard to argue with a crashed space station for an HQ tho haha
---
You spawn inside the mine. No need for radiation suit until after the event. I had time to put on my suit after the event every time.
---
Agreed
---
I‚Äôd join.
---
I guess, I have done the event now quite a few, some I was dumped into an empty room so missed out entering with the others but it is fun on the other times, I liked the first one where I came out with nearly 200 screws.
---
Well, unless something changed, legendary dragons alone are legacy now so yea I would say it is pretty rare.  
---
As far as I am aware the only place you could still get legendary dragons for a long time was at the end of the vault 94 raid as that is where I got all of mine.  Since they closed the 94 raids I have not heard of anyone receiving one and I have not gotten oen either.
---
I haven't done the PTS myself, but if this is the case, then I can see where the disconnect is taking place. Devs, are usually very direct or pointed individuals when it comes to details. Specificity and detail is key in communication when trying to describe software behavior to someone who wants to replicate the issue. They probably waste more time trying to piece the bug together and replicate it then actually fixing them.
---
I have a nasty feeling that their valiant sacrifice will be in vain.
---
Mole rats should have a max level of 50, in my opinion.  Level 100 is absurd.
---
Ya but that‚Äôs a ghost town atm
---
Double as in the double ammo capacity, not twoshot. Your dragon is a legacy of its a 2 or 3 star so should be worth a bit to a collector
---
If you come across a player around level 15 I would like to donate a one star handmade and 1000 5.56. Pm me if you find someone
---
Wait, did you find the colossus?
---
If I had a dollar for everytime I killed one of them.. 
---
I‚Äôd have like three bucks.
---
Ok now this resonates:
---
"these types of "luck"-based mechanics are designed to abuse the compulsive and obsessive behavior in your human brain."
---
It is my opinion; however, that only a small percentage of players succumb to these manipulations, just as only a certain percentage of the population are motivated by compulsive gambling. 
---
Now, if this business philosophy is based around exploiting those who may buy uncontrollably, then that's pretty awful.
---
On the other point, I might question the idea of this being a strategy to get people curious to logon and see what's on the Atomic shop each day, mostly because that never occurred to me, but also because they could tremendously impact that approach by releasing an Atomic shop app for smartphones.
---
This might actually keep some players like me more engaged with the game when not playing, and more likely to logon, or even make purchases on days that I wasn't planning to play.
---
I have definitely never logged on to buy something from the Atomic shop and then logged off, but maybe others do that.
---
I'm not sure why you have to launch the game to shop, actually, because I would check the shop more often if I could do so from other devices.
---
I do find the space very small and somewhat claustrophobic, it is a shame they did not design a space like Arktos with a few distinct areas joined by tunnels.
---
You can't get quad on BP weapons. I experimented with an ammo glitch and BP weapons have an infinite fire rate, or at least as fast as you can pull the trigger, so they'd be incredibly broken with this
---
FALGSC!
---
I'm not on a lot in the evening but my tag is WastingMy and I'm a level 120ish scrub.
---
I have my shed and camp now designed *just so* and although I could store and rebuild the shed I just can't face the process, maybe in time.
---
"That's if they fix the current issues" that has never stopped them before. But I hope your right.
---
I have recently heard you can still get 1* dragons and rippers as prizes from the monster mash top prize thing but have not confirmed it myself
---
Ahh okay. I knew about the 1 star rippers from there but not dragons ty for the info
---
If you already have that $20 in atoms then Bethesda already has your money and there is no need for them to change anything. ;)
---
Imagine being this much of a shill.
---
The only thing you get from the chest is caps and some ore. Where are you getting your info from?
---
It was a lot of fun.   I was having a great time.  .    I just sort of wandered into the wrong event and was ill prepared.    Did not have my best weapon on me nor best armor.    Feel bad for the other players who were probably there to earn xp.  But this is what I like about the game.   I had no intention in playing that event ... I was simply wandering (as I do sometimes) and oops... got sucked into this mine and hey look ... other players.   Then I noticed it was the event ...    I should‚Äôve bailed but it‚Äôs not in my nature ... however, now I know what to do for next time
---
I never fail to find one in the military wing of the WS bunker
---
I'm all for spending less time in loading screens. The only time I ever have to force-quit the game is because I get stuck in loading screens. Less of that is a good thing.
---
The legendary run gives you rewards each time you rank up. You get over 100 rewards when you finish. 
---
Now you want more, some of them the same rewards from the run. 
---
The legendary run gives everyone the same rewards. Getting more rewards if you finish before the end, gives some panthers more than those that finish later.
---
Which completely goes against the legendary run idea. That all players can earn the SAME rewards. 
---
And before you say what about people who can‚Äôt play everyday. You don‚Äôt have to play every day to make it the end. I haven‚Äôt, I‚Äôm almost done. I also didn‚Äôt grind the repeatable xp. 
---
People that joined late. That‚Äôs always going to happen. They can buy ranks if they really want some thing from the run. 
---
They also seem to be adding some items, like camp items to what you can buy with gold.
---
So asking for more after you finish is greedy. You want more because you dismissed early. 
---
Which is hilarious considering people endless complained about the grind of the Legendary Run. That the daily challenges are boring and repetitive. 
---
But now people want to do then to get more if the same of what they have been complaining about.
---
hey duder, you're clearly having a bad day and cannot stop yourself from replying to people
---
try logging off of reddit for the rest of the day, your mental well being will clearly improve
---
I have to characters on my main account and because of a purchasing mix up I ended up with a second game code and account, that one doesn't have FO1st and really feel the limitations, although I can now dump everything periodically to my other account and enjoy the infinite scrap box.
---
So yes I agree Fallout 76 1st really is the way to play this game.
---
It's a good concept for a prefab, but a bit hodgepodge.
---
This issue made me edit my builds and included gun-fu and other changes, only have adrenaline 2 now, still gives a nice boost.
---
But, it is cursed damn it.
---
Yes, but you still deal much higher damage than anyone else.
---
All the bloodied builds I played with hopped in PA, makes survival easier.
---
Idk about a communist faction but im ready to take the fight to them. Let's have a raid where we get on a plane and go over there. Expansion .
---
will do
---
Schrodinger's mining robot is the true "canon" fate.
---
Depending on quantity given for completing these challenges. A player could probably buy the entirety of the legendary run, then grind endlessly to actually profit in Atoms once the season ends. 
---
i.e: pay $100 to finish pass with 6 weeks left, grind dailies/weeklies for those 6 weeks to get more than $100 in Atoms.. right?
---
I have Dodgy, but I run a bloody power armor heavy weapons build, so I have to use emergency protocols. To compensate for this, I was thinking I could use the nuka cola perk with nuka cola quantum to keep my AP filled up to fuel dodgy. Maybe stacked with nukashine for the +50% AP regen effect if you can keep drinking nukashine to delay the blackout.
---
I'm imagining chugging the stuff, and then the music from Super Mario when you pick up a star playing.
---
You do not have to leave the mine to get the rewards. You can stay in there and loot everything. When the timer runs out it will collapse and black out and spawn you at the exit. You still get it.   
---
From what I noticed after doing the event 21 times yesterday is:  
---
The cursed weapons have fixed attributes. All executioners.  
---
The trunk at the entrance while running out is full of crap.  
---
Wendigos spawn in crazy numbers when you start doing massive damage to Earle. IE hacked 50 cals.  
---
If you die before Earle, you spawn inside the mine up the shaft. If you die after Earle, you spawn outside the exit.  
---
To get the event rewards you just have to be in the mine or at the exit when the time runs out.  
---
You can keep getting the plans after you learned them.  
---
Cripple the screaming head to slow down the rate of Fears. It heals after a bit. Stay vigilant.  
---
When you drop the nuke on the mine, keep in on the edge of the nuke zone for easier extraction.  
---
You can milk the event and leave with greater than 250 screws per run. Glorious.  
---
Perhaps I should make a new post about this..  
---
I agree, legendary items should be dropped directly into inventory. I died a lot after Earle and failed to loot him far too many times.
---
Your point makes little sense. Their idea isnt anything locked behind paying anything so people can get those but also if people dont finish then they wont get the same rewards as the people that finished since the people who did finish would get the later rewards than the people that didnt finish. Also its Not that people want to do dailies its that they want to het stuff from doing them.
---
What I don't get is exactly this kind of interactions.
---
The moLerat was lvl 100 because you are over lvl 100,and so it could overpower the scorps. But if a lvl 30 player was at the event ,would the cards be inverted?
---
yeah, i was surprised why its rooting there like 2Months  ü§î
---
Lol. Rezzed?  Queen fight with a bow?  Turn it in. Clearly never been to a queen fight and seriously doubtful your beyond level 30 or A week in. Rezzed üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Could all be vax's simulation, after all we get exp points for adventure mode from nuclear winter.
---
got a level 14 in my world jaybird976955
---
They did it because it was fun. We actually need more of that in this game.
---
PERK COINS a nice jab haha
---
I crafted 30 secret service armor last night and didn't see any trends in the 3rd perk in my 12 of 3* ones. Sneak 2, AWR 1, FDCWR 2, Sentinel 1, water breathing 2, fall damage 1, durability 1, limb damage 2.
---
With the way it‚Äôs set up, that won‚Äôt be everyone...
---
But if we get actual time between seasons, that would work quite well there too.
---
*Though we really don‚Äôt need all these different currencies.*
---
Unlock and claim. It only expires if you don‚Äôt claim it and the season ends.
---
My point that you shouldn‚Äôt get more rewards for daily challenges than what the legendary forum offers doesn‚Äôt make sense?
---
Your full of bullshit. You know your being greedy and just want extra gold, caps, scrip and more.
---
Greedy and needy.
---
Also at the queen the whole server shows up and I don't need to waste as many ammo.
---
I suppose I meant that some days I feel like shopping and others I have other things in mind. 
---
I buy what I want. Most of the time I go to the shop, I've already purchased everything I want.  
---
I've spent a lot on game items this week, money that might have gone to Bethesda instead. The same will be true every week as long as this is the business model.
---
... 
---
What point are you trying to make?
---
ooh, gonna try that.
---
Do you have damage numbers on? How much damage are you doing per hit?
---
And what perks do you use, also is it a legendary chainsaw you have? Cheers.
---
these builds are buffed to the maximum. I don't think the average player buffs itself that much just to fight the queen, or anything for that matter.
---
they'd also do around 3x less damage (and then some because of how armor works) since sneak multipliers do not trigger if your target is in combat with anything else, including other players.
---
This is my Tech data mine. There‚Äôs always 2-4 pieces. Server hop and get more.
---
You're right. And also, if bloodied doesn't kill fast enough, the mobs are gonna smack you to the moon. It's possible that we see a decrease in bloodied builds going for more tanky builds because of that. You can see it in the Colossus event, where taking no damage is quite hard to achieve and non-bloodied usually last longer.
---
No but I‚Äôve gotten over ten berserkers weapons last night. Ugh
---
If I offered you $20 or $100, would you would choose the $20?
---
1. Dont worry about the timer. Just loot you'll be fine.  
---
2. The loot crate at the end of the exit run is not filled with anything good.
---
Somewhat off topic, but the whole not being able to loot the boss thing reminds me of Encryptid. I have never been able to find the body of the Sheepsquatch Imposter! Not once! Does it drop loot? I've search for a while and eventually just give up.
---
Pajajaja
---
Well, according to that ghoul lady you get the stealth suit from, there are still Chinese agents running around Appalachia besides the ones in the base; and there is one particular agent that she is terrified of. The computers in the chinese base also showed they were using the Motherlode to dig infiltration tunnels all over, including one that was "incomplete" to a "redacted" site. Maybe their main base, or a secret Enclave vault?
---
This is the kind of stuff that makes me not want to jump back in.
---
Not against the falling embers, you essentially die instantly no matter what.  And getting attacked by 10 spawn isn't fun either.
---
div 2 is in a good spot for now, imo.  they keep altering the balances tho so its a little inconsistent.  right now, hard/challenging feels like a good fight w/o resorting to the bullet-sponge shitshow those games devolve into (cough, one wasteland, cough, cough)
---
You know that your never gonna get any more atoms besides the non-repeatable quests. Is it so bad to have a renewable source of currencies?
---
I mean, pre-war America, yeah.
---
But we‚Äôre the post war survivers who lives through that hell. Maggie especially, she‚Äôs not from a vault. For her of all people to so casually suggest launching one just to *maybe* find a memento of her dead dad?
---
The fuck?
---
How many times does Bethesda have to punch people in the face with this kind of stuff before people stop giving them money above the base cost of the game?
---
As long as people are buying Atoms and paying for Fallout 1st this shit isn't going to change. Issues like this have been raised numerous times since the game launched. They don't care. They only care about money coming in. Stop giving them more money.
---
Take your time and figure it out. There's more going on around you than just point shoot and loot. You get event rewards when its over just pay attention and stay alive.
---
"I want my games to be as apolitical as metal gear" Gamers.
---
Order of Mysteries was actually one of the cooler quest lines and I was always disappointed that they didn't do more with it. I haven't gone back or used the items from that quest since 2018.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
You don‚Äôt even lose those. I collected 250 in one of my runs and died by a spawn and still had them all. You don‚Äôt lose junk if you die during events anymore. Only if you die during normal play.
---
I didn't.  Why should I have to waste thousands of non-duped bullets being shot through my non-duped weapon to do essentially no damage to it?
---
Oh, really? Well. That‚Äôs something.
---
Mini furious vats 2 star value?
---
You'd think an Xbox One X would show something, could be it though. Thank you.
---
Sorry to say, but for me personally the only one on that list that is still relevant is Bullion.  I'm constantly bumping into the cap and scrip limits, swimming in ammo and scrap, have plenty of repair kits from SBQ, 8k atoms and rarely anything I care enough to buy..
---

---
World record team kill....2 seconds from touchdown. Notice that multiple players in the team are sneak attacking the queen.
---
You are right that people would never buff to this extent just to do a queen run. However, that fact does not dispute the fact that it is demonstrably possible to murder the queen with no exploits in under 10-20 seconds depending on build. Tyr and Captainoob also demonstrated that it can be done in under 50 seconds without food or chem buffs and in one case without adrenaline.
---
I can't believe you got that bug about 4 times in a row yesterday. Completely unacceptable.
---
Being a bullet sponge doesn't make it harder, it makes it more annoying.
---
No danger at all when you land, but you need good armor or immaculate stealth management. There are lots of dangers during the fight, and some of them can kill you outright or quite fast, even in fully upgraded PA. It's a bit more difficult than SBQ, and that's welcome.
---
It‚Äôs almost as if Ward and the Whitesprings Train Station Vendor are actively trying to avoid being interacted with. Maybe they were the ones who made the free Vault Tec duffle bag for us all with the horrible hit box?
---
I only recently picked it up after not playing since ~2017, so I can't comment very much. I leveled the season pass to 100 in about 3-4 weeks with a mix of grinding and just casual play and exploration. Compared to fo76 this is much more friendly and I was happy to shovel over $10 when I reached Lv100 to unlock the "premium" content of the season pass.
---
I'm in the same boat. I'd add onto this question with "wtf is the 'secret service' reward? it didn't clarify what it is. armor? an outfit? something else? i can't find it anywhere in my inventory or camp build so I'm assuming it's something to do with wastelands that i haven't unlocked.
---
Did they ever fix the problem with the blacktusk over healing with those boxes or them being unreachable to destroy?
---
Yeah it can be so frustrating sometimes, just trying to convey simple things or relay instructions.
---
Same with how I wish we had more available signage to leave custom messages around our camps.
---
It‚Äôs not a problem for greedy people. Or people who expect people others to work for free because they want more free stuff in a video game.
---
If your a decent person the yes it is bad what your asking for. 
---
If you can‚Äôt afford your entertainment then stop playing.
---
I feel like for the PTS they should make ALL new Atom Shop items free for the sake of testing, and players who go on the PTS when there is new things to test should have a form of reward, like each time you play on the PTS for an hour you get some Atoms that multiply each time you test on there.
---
Sea of Thieves gives players a ton of premuim currency to test out the new things to the store to report bugs, Fallout 76 really should do the same, like the collisions on some of these items are crazy. 
---
Coming from a 3D artist background myself it bewilders me that they did not center the pivot on the Communist Fence, or have certain collisions completely out of wack like the Blood Eagles Nest or the Communist Bunker.
---
You can progress in the overseers questline, but you are right a lot is blocked off for wastelanders content. Have you done firebreathers already/started doing stuff for rose?
---
Hopefully this is fixed soon.
---
Edit: [not sure if this workaround can help](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/icoyd0/a_possible_solution_for_the_ounce_of_prevention/)
---
I completely agree, I also feel as if the Colossus should not be effected by Bloody Mess. There‚Äôs been a couple times where I couldn‚Äôt even look him because the body parts were nowhere to be found. The whole event is just a mess in its current state.
---
Bring a scrapbox with you if you have one. Loot everything and scrap it before Earle dies so you're not rushing around trying to find meat piles before the collapse.
---
Because OP said has an opinion of something that‚Äôs not that much of a problem? As far as I could see, there wasn‚Äôt any lore items inside the mine. Just around it and in the room prior to dropping down the mineshaft. You get the loot whether you live or not. And our three person group killed him in 5 minutes and the event lasts for 20. That‚Äôs 15 minutes of farming Wendigo‚Äòs. I fail to see any major issues.
---
PC a couple of nights ago. Whitesprings station. Absolutely screwed the season to the point of complete crash. I am all for people dicking about with glitched weapons - out of the way of others. There is so many empty space you could go to town in. Worse that could happen it kills that players game or kills the session / causes lag. At least out in the boonies the risk is just that person screwing themselves up.
---
Gt: orias
---
Honestly? The rate of fire and weak points make all the difference with it. I do around 114 to 120 per rounds and can dump a clip of 75 rounds in about 20 seconds.
---
Now it also has 50 percent more limb damage... idk if that does anything, but with the AA that you get from power armor, if im getting headshots with at close range i can cleave into the boss. Same with SBQ. The issues is that all the rounds need to be on target and it not good for mobs.... also the rounds are an ass to keep in stock. I use it only for bosses and i cam solo them at close range and hitting weak spots
---
Oh, and I do have adrenal reaction and t65 armor, so I can survive next to the beast
---
Oooft, nice! Those Super Mutants better kiss their green asses good bye!
---
Explosives dont work on SBQ.
---
My suggestion. Find a gatling laser or ultracite gatling laser (second is better and uses nor.al fusion cores also) just grab it out of stash box along with 3 or 4 full fusion cores and just shoot away.
---
bethesda and free? how did your autocorrection let that one slip by?
---
I‚Äôve only not found it a hand full of times. Are you sure you‚Äôre hitting it enough? I‚Äôve had that happen a few times.
---
The auto IS the mod you want. That's why it exists.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I buy the argument that having to run a nuke silo for this event is ‚Äúfun‚Äù. 
---
I liked the event, sure, but needing to nuke it makes it fun? Uhhhh...
---
More of a bullet sponge than sbq, worse rewards... I think I'll pass.
---
You need to find a magic weapon like a lmg or 50 cal there is a video by angry turtle you could watch
---
Nice Bethesda slam
---
Do the agility test at the sunnytop ski place. Sleep, cranberry relish or cola and then do it over and over. I got to around lvl 32 before it took too long to level up.
---
Keep in mind this strategy gets you no gear, but a lot of stims rad away and grenades so you won't have good stuff for your level but that's easy to fix
---
You can claim it
---
If you die while the timer is still going you will not lose your junk. The event is still active.  
---
Just hang out at the exit garage until the timer expires.
---
Wait what trunk are you talking about?
---
They reused the garage door sound.  Sounds exactly the same.
---
Soviet technology is all a little bugged.  Kudos to bethesda on historical accuracy with this one.
---
That is one of those MIRV miniguns. Unfortunately they're still in circulation.
---
on the higher difficulties it can still be a problem.  ive had some success using emp gadget &amp; grenades
---
Yea it's a hacked weapon I saw a guy with a mini gun that shoots rapid mini nukes literally made the game so laggy I had to hop servers
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs so much better. I did 6 runs last night and died at the end of two of them and kept all my stuff.
---
Anyone got tips for completing it? 
---
I‚Äôm on the orange but it takes forever to complete
---
I cant afford to buy atoms. Why is it so bad to want to be able to have a chance to obtain already limited items locked behind a paywall? I thought that the legendary run was so that even free players could get items.
---
The legendary run gives you rewards each time you rank up. You get over 100 rewards when you finish.
---
Direct quote from your previous comment:
---
*Which completely goes against the legendary run idea. That all players can earn the SAME rewards.*
---
Yeh i completed rose‚Äôs quest line and the advanced training for the responders. Most i can do is run around Appalachia looking for her holotapes tho. But i haven‚Äôt tried it in a private world yet but i will now
---
Get a video camera and monitor the comings and goings of people to your camp. or better yet develop an Alt and have it stay at your camp with a looping message that anyone who approach's your camp is being monitored. And alas none of this is do-able so having nice things are for people who stay at home to guard them. It would be cool to have a Mutant who guards the camp and attacks anyone who defiles your goods or better yet if such a thing happens then the turrets should automatically turn on the culprit..
---
Yeah. It's 12 per second on her.  24 if it's her head. No perks affect the chainsaw. It's just solid burst dps. Not sure why I'm being downvoted...
---
Oh, and it's not legendary.
---
Because the content sucks, and they don't want you realizing just how out of date their entire architecture is.
---
indeed. observe, adapt, overcome ;)
---
The canon fate seems pretty clear to me. Motherlode is a plot device that fades to myth, either through sacrifice with settlers or becoming a forgotten relic of bygone era because the Raiders have no real awareness, need, or ability to use it.
---
I've heard AA is effective compared to other types of effects. No personal experience myself though, I main a magic bloodied shotgun that doesn't seem to do much damage
---
Just the pick axe, shovel and harpoon gun.
---
I would drop health to around 50%, get adrenal reaction mutation and use the JE 50 cal. That should do the most dps out of those weapons.
---
Harpoon gun???
---
I didn‚Äôt even know there was a disco ball lol, gonna have to add it
---
With a shotgun build which is high STR you can switch into heavy weapons easily. Even without perks, you should be able to do passable damage, but you can always get the perks when you level up and just swap them in when you need them. For a quick and effective weapon you can just use the Final Word 50cal you get from Beckett's quest. It's a decent 50cal that will work well enough with any build. If you can find a bloodied or junkies one it's even better.
---
One is. Not sure if it's intentional or bad writing but the motherlode you rescue and the one in the vault raid are different numbers.
---
Events. Even if you join an event with lots of high levels who one shot everything the end rewards are worth it. You also get a lot of good rewards. If you‚Äôre completely skipping quests then hop around to events and in between them go around and clear areas like Charleston, White Springs, etc
---
For some reason, yes. Unless they changed it, the Harpoon is also a FFR weapon, despite it being a single shot weapon that doesn't benefit from the star.
---
And what's the point of using ammo for the chainsaw, exactly? You are easily interrupted with it, and it breaks easily since durability registers *per tick*. Making it use ammo would ruin the weapon completely.
---
Perhaps it's plain laziness.
---
I have a second account as a mule and have been doing a bit of legendary so I claimed it and it recorded and gave me the bullion even though I haven‚Äôt done the quest yet
---
Not sure. I am a full strength build so I usually end up as a conduit. Not that it helps because it still kills me almost instantly when it finds me. Just seems like nobody else will play the conduit. When I did finally get my fixer plans, I was conduit on all 3 pylons! Sooo long story short...maybe not.
---
It‚Äôs just so jarring playing modern warfare or overwatch and there‚Äôs skins for like everything and then this game has like 5. Outfits are nice I guess.
---
That wasn't my point
---
Oh yes. It should be along the options on standard lightbulb I think...probably near the strobe lights.
---
I always try to have at least one and a couple of strobe lights somewhere.
---
I mean, if they're all sneaking then she's not in combat. that's not the case in 99% of all SBQ fights.
---
captainoob's 50 seconds sounds about right, but even then he was soloing her with sneak. I'd say 2:30-5:00 is a realistic time.
---
You deleted your original comment. To take out the part about how you don't want to spend your own money. Which was probably the truer statement than you can't afford to buy atoms. 
---
The Legendary Run gives you free stuff. You got all the free stuff. Now you want MORE. 
---
You also deleted the part about a company being greedy. It's an entertainment company. They only make things for money. There's nothing greedy about that. It's just your attempt to try and get some moral high ground about YOU being greedy. Which is probably why you deleted it and other parts and rewrote your statement. 
---
So yeah, you are just greedy. Deal with it.
---
If Summersville Dam got blown to hell with a/many mini nuke/s then sure as hell a few well places ones would break open the mine.
---
I'll be cutting it damned close, I'm at 81 now with the current weeklies done and I have to miss a day or two of the double score weekend.
---
FO3 is outdated. Using ammo for a melee weapon in a game where repairing things can sometimes be a pain in the ass,  especially given how easily the good gear breaks. That's all I'm saying. Adding extra ammo weight,  ontop of having to keep it loaded would just suck.
---
Kind of a weirdly specific critique.
---
Do you feel bad every time you use a fatman? 
---
This is a world where a liquid radiation cure in a bag exists.
---
Don‚Äôt overthink it.
---
I use adrenal reaction on my bloodied steath commando build, but how effective is it with being at 50% health vs 20%? Id be sacrificing my Vangaurds Dr by dropping my health, but could probably get by for just the event
---
Any idea when it will be released?
---
I deleted it because im too lazy to edit it also bethesda is basically locking all atom shop items behind a paywall whic means not all players will be able to get the same rewards and only people that pay to get atoms will be able to get them. Sounds like bethesdas being pretty greedy not me. If you check my deleted comment using a website you will see that i never said i didnt want to buy them.
---
Why are flares even an option? I can‚Äôt recall the last time I saw anyone use a flare gun in this game except when I shot one off to be stupid.
---
I love coming on here to see ignorant foodies complaining because workshops are PvP zones.
---
I got a few yesterday, so they're definitely spawning. I just have gotten in the habit of checking every file cabinet I see.  I also always grab one in a silo while I'm running a nuke or Watoga HS when I'm doing Monster Mash.
---
And the Communist Secret Agents we have in game don't even wear their unique power armor!
---
I love that design. Imagine how menacing it would be to have those three glowing eyes glowering at you from the darkness. Missed opportunity.
---
I would run the JE or the AA25. I think the Colossus actually has higher DR but a lower HP pool. I hit the queen harder with all my characters.
---
Probably modeled on the tinfoil hat in game.
---
If you redeem it, it will sit in your collections screen until you can use it
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, it‚Äôs a hacked weapon. If you‚Äôre on console that means there‚Äôs a new exploit.
---
It's all ridiculously spongy.  Even the spawn are.  Not hard, just too annoying for me to care about, especially with the bad rewards.
---
Where you come in (and eventually run to exit), there is a locked room with a trunk that opens at the end.
---
Maybe because as a role playing game people are more likely to want to role play commies and not their real life flag waving neighbors. The more make believe "removed from every day reality" aspects might rate more popularly.
---
That takes more work to delete and then repost. So another lie.
---
just the instructions on how lol
---
JE at full health. I‚Äôve seen health be important for this. And you‚Äôll prolly take rads anyways and get to 50 towards the end
---
On PC yes
---
Right now im getting about 10 dmage per shot out of the junkies, and 7ish out of the AA, but it shoots faster so I think it ends up doing more overall damage. Im looking into getting the TS guns depending on the feedback. Ive gotten the full rewards on all the fights so im doing OK i guess, but i want to contribute more
---
Damn
---
I've been reading about the new 'One Wasteland' &amp; it concerns me what it will be like for a low lvl player to be hanging out with high lvl players, going forward. Far as I can tell, high lvl players will have minimum lvl25 enemies &amp; in most areas like The Mire &amp; Cranberry Bog, the enemies will most likely start at lvl65 &amp; go up to 100. I don't know how they'll figure out which enemy to place (lvl) if there's a lvl plus 150 player with say a lvl 15+.
---
His name was Robert Paulson.
---
It was 1,2, and Tactics actually. 
---
FO3 is the 5th game in the franchise
---
I main mellee in 76. It doesn't break all that often at all and is super cheap to fix. Not sure when it is ever a pain in the ass. If you arn't at a bench just use those 300 piled up kits.
---
That's not a bad theory.
---
I've started to write down ammo count before doing the convertor because I don't think it's giving out the right amount of points. I also button jam really fast through it as well lol
---
Yeah but until they spend those atoms they aren't giving Bethesda another $20 either.
---
^^^^^
---
I like this guy. He's alright in my book.
---
i see it this way... 
---
some people will find it annoying, i see it that its more challenging because it doesn't go down as easily, yes your using more bullets but that is the whole point of the challenge behind it. that just my way of looking at it.
---
What about the guys who did do the settlers line, then do the event breach and clear? Are they locked in a mystery of where it came from?
---
I hve no idea the lore on the event vs the wastelands line, it just looks the same to me.
---
Idk. Part of me would love that, but at the same time I love the rush for escape. It feels intense and something  Capps off the climax pretty well.
---
Its pretty brutal . I used to carry ALOT of weapons because the weight reduction armor perks made it more efficient than using the stash .The friggin wheel would display the first weapon of the same type, not the weapon that was actually favorited. 
---
But for radaway, I just leave my pip-boy on the status tab, open it up and use the hotkey when I need it. Only way I can use it fast enough when running ore in radiation rumble.
---
Right? Also why no cores? 
---
I don't even want to buy em, I have almost 100 plasma cores sitting around.
---
YES, PLEASE!  I want my raider waster underarmor and Survivor denim to be things I will actually use!  They did this once with the responders firefighter suspenders at least, I dont know why they didn't continue. Some of my favorite costumes are underarms but I dont use them. Also, I believe we should be able to craft  atom underarmor skins as any class of underarmor that we know plans for, instead of just casual.
---
?
---
I could go to a vendor and get way more than 350 for one.  No one is getting rich selling them for 300-400.  I want you to buy them because you intend to use them.
---
The ingredients for several serums are not easy to come by, and I ain't going to be farming them just so you can have the privilege of making bank off me.
---
It's true sometimes the wendigo's drop whatever ammo your using as well as the normal stuff. It helped me out when my main broke and my ammo went low.
---
It's not a challenge though.  Dark Souls is challenging.  Not because you have to hit the time ad nauseam, but because it's actually... hard.
---
That one I can probably answer - they can‚Äôt account for the charge on them.
---
I mentioned this to him. Said we better get you to fifty so I can turn him into a full on Unyielding bloodied monster before this all changes. I love sharing all my horded treasure.
---
So damage per shot would be more important than damage per second? The JE and AA25 are pretty close in per shot damage. I havent tried the TSs yet
---
Imagine being this much of a tard, saying some stupid cliche thing, thinking you are smart or funny. Im not arguing about the bugged ammo converter (i dont use it all). Im just wondering why people convert ammo points to cheapest ammo to make (just raw steel), instead some expensive one.
---
 Edit: while other comment saying its cheapest ammo to make, being upvoted, reddit at it best
---
JE with adrenal reaction then?
---
I hear what you're saying, but people tend to impulse buy more if they think something is limited or going away. Everything will cycle back through the atom shop which is both good and bad.
---
It's Schr√∂dinger's mole rat. It's in a perpetual state of being not dead or alive until a player shows up.
---
Responders don‚Äôt seem like a warring faction, they barely have any defensive strategy and completely lack any offensive capabilities. Maybe Free States fits better imo.
---
That seems the most powerful imo
---
It's a pain in the ass when,  for example, you just started your camp from scratch or built a bunch of gear to disassemble for blueprints, and your resources are drained. I use melee too. The difference is the chainsaw takes durability hits per damage tick, in rapid succession  vs slower hitting melee gear.  Faster durability hits occur as a result. I don't understand why people want ammo for melee weapons. The whole point is to have a weapon to fall back on if you have no ammo in the first place.
---
I'm well aware it's the fifth game. Not sure I see your point? The idea of melee weapons using ammo is outdated and absurd. Not sure why what entry 3 falls under has anything to do with this.
---
Wanna know as well. Haven't played fo76 for a month or so.
---
Like i said normally for me aswell but now only new metal cans.
---
True. Didn't think about that
---
Same I haven‚Äôt played 76 in like 6 months and I check this sub multiple times a week
---
To be fair ultracite emergency protocols are rare
---
Yeah I like the quick get away too, just trying to think of a way we could loot a little while still getting that chase
---
I'm pretty sure adrenal reaction is a one and done.  It just activates at the breakpoint and that's it.  No scaling with health.  I could be wrong though.
---
Lock-picking seems to be an RNG favorite for me when crafting SS armor...
---
I do similarly.
---
1c for building plans, 5 for armor plans, 10 for weapon. Ammo for 1 unless it is for more desirable ammo like 5.56, then it is 2.
---
I don't care about making money off the vendors, it is there to help others get stuff cheap. I make more than enough selling 1400 to npc vendors daily.
---
If it's anything like the clowns who show up and melt the SBQ, I figure all of the mass duped items, which are still easily accessible for anyone who wants to go down that route, ultimately flooded out the legitimate less-than-perfect items.
---
I've had this issue of another player not wanting to play the objective at Guided Meditation. He was sitting on top of a structure shooting at ghouls but he couldn't be bothered to go repair the meditation hubs. What some ppl don't seem to realise is that if all the hubs are destroyed the event fails.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a week and I just check the sub so I can stay in the loop and know at all times when Bethesda does something wrong to infuriate the community
---
I prefer to delete it anyways and if you do decide to go on a website to get back deleted comments you will see that you read my deleted comment wrong. If i edited it you wouldnt be able to see it using any website or anything.
---
This. Also demolition expert and grenadier will add to the explosive effect damage and range respectively.
---
Alrighty folks I've done what some of you have suggested and I thank this community for being extremely helpful!
---
Did you go to Abby‚Äôs bunker?
---
it happens with every death regardless of character, just with the event being in an instance you can't go back into, it makes an already frustrating bug infuriating
---
Yes, I've been having this issue since I got this particular Fallout account back in February.
---
You can use [this site](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) to test out damage numbers. Obviously bloodied build does way more damage at 20% but 50% health gives nice survivability especially in wendigo colossus fight.
---
You can later buy secret service gear after story ends for gold. And what you got is ghuilly suit skin for it.
---
No. Instructions still show up once you go to the bunker.
---
Maybe they could allow people to browse the vault and mark items they want on a wish list, then send notifications or emails when those items become available. 
---
I don't even know what items came and went while I was away from the game.
---
Hmh, you're right. But I don't like the idea of the free states, as they are most likely all dead(Some responders are still alive). How about we make a compromise and replace the responders with settlers?
---
The fact they still twitch and move a bit makes me distrustful of just how dead they're supposed to be.
---
TIL there's a trunk.
---
And they‚Äôre probably making a lot more money to compensate for that. 
---
If you‚Äôre not a regular player, then you‚Äôre less likely to spend money with them anyways.
---
Seems to me they‚Äôre catering to the primary customers, not their occasional ones. 
---
So, in the end, this was nothing more than ‚ÄòI wish I could buy whatever I wanted whenever I wanted‚Äô. Right?  Everything else was fluff.
---
I'm still salty over the fact that the terminal still exists. The convertor should use the same UI window that is used for trading legendaries for scrip.
---
The ammo convertor has such a nice unique 3D model, the terminal fucking ruins it.
---
I certainly hope not. If there's only 1 challenge per day worth 10 atoms, times 8 weeks after purchasing levels unlocks, times 7 days in a week, that's only a return of ~$5.60 on a $100 investment. Certainly not worth doing even if there were weekly challenges that awarded atoms.
---
The quests in this game stopped making sense after Wastelanders when they created these potential story rich factions and we only got one daily quest from Foundation from Ward nonetheless. 
---
So nuking a bit of debris to get into a mine and killing supposedly already expired people seems like a step up.
---
I can't stand looking or listening to Ward anymore...
---
They should test the game. I know it would be inconvenient, but...
---
I didnt downvote you, but most players arent really interested in PVP.
---
Especially as most "PVP" on the survival server consisted of people wrecking any camp they found, or hiding near train stations waiting to shoot anyone that came near.
---
I‚Äôve only really had ok experiences. It‚Äôs tanks AF, I‚Äôll give it that. I don‚Äôt have to worry about resource cost much because of being melee.
---
The biggest damage source is the acid/fire. Other than that, I‚Äôve had issues with people going after just the spawn and not the boss. I don‚Äôt exactly get *why*, but they do.
---
It's not FFR anymore. It's weight reduction, bashing damage and executioners now.
---
weird that it didn't say that. it just says 'secret service'. all the other versions of the skin say it's the ghilly suit. oh Bethesda.
---
I think this could definitely be an interesting one, the only issue being that there are just too many anti-commie faction. I could see this being fun if played out like ESO‚Äôs alliance wars, the only problem being that they‚Äôve always had balancing issues with one faction slowly over-taking the others in participation. 
---
I think a good approach, which the devs hinted they may be doing similar next year, is having this a PvE or even just mob v mob event with players being allowed to aid the side they wish. This could lead to pve and pvp skirmishes, taking of faction bases could be introduced and other mechanics. Bethesda seems clear they don‚Äôt think this community is really worried about pvp anymore, but are trying to still offer options for those players. It sounds like they‚Äôre looking for a way where both parties can enjoy a new gameplay mechanic that is meant to do just that.
---
I think that's part of it.  Vendors in the Forest are a mystery because unless you can find them on the map, you really have no idea if it's a newbie vendor or a veteran who just didn't want to deal with the constant enemy attacks (i.e. my main's CAMP, and whose choice will probably be vindicated in the damage re-balance).
---
But there are vendors everywhere who bloat up their "Armor" with a bunch of Fasnacht masks and nothing else.  Chalk it up to Bethesda not believing that we ought to know the player's level or their Legendary count.
---
I guess I figured it triggered at lower health because of all the bloodied builds using it. So it triggers at 50%?
---
Maybe add some "controlled" territory for each one (30-35% of the entire map divided equally among the 5) and the rest is open to whatever may happen between the 2. Should one faction manage to decimate another they could "claim" that territory as thier own this making for a true war. There can only be one winner :)
---
Thanks! I'll give it a look
---
I call posting this next week
---
i can't say anything about dark souls, never played it.
---
I like that better since the Raiders have a faction so Settlers should be a fitting equivalent. I too thought about Free States being dead but the faction itself could be revived by the vault dwellers.
---
Understood. I still think it's better than nothing. It's also better than a return to atoms-only, in my opinion.
---
Junkies tops out at five addictions, and you only need to be addicted, not stuffing the withdrawals.  So they're are three lines of thought for maintenance of junkies. 
---
1) Maintain.  Get addicted to five easy to find drugs that stack (ex., alcohol stacks with all chems so it's a no-brainier first choice.) As long as you have the chems active, you gain all of the benefits of Junkies, most of the benefit of the chems, and very few downsides.  You will need to constantly source your chems, though.
---
2) Ignore.  You build your addictions where the withdrawal penalties are spread across your SPECIAL in the last detrimental way possible. 
---
3) Hybrid. Keep a small supply of what you're addicted to on hand for circumstances where you need the skill that's being penalized.
---
I saw a level 1400; w/ a pirate hat and hunter‚Äôs long coat. Hmmmmmm
---
You are wrong on that one, adrenal reaction works kinda like unyielding. It gives max 50% of extra damage when you are below 20% health.
---
Is something going on with Melee? For an hour or so yesterday I played after the new patch. My main is melee specced right now, and uses a 3* fireaxe. Numerous times I used Vats, went up to an enemy, the animation of swinging the axe happened, blood flew, and they took no damage. We're talking level 9 ghouls and level 1 robots here. One robot I attacked 3 times, saw three "hit" animations, and it took no damage.
---
All I mean is that you have to learn patterns, get better over time, etc.  This fight only requires you to spam stimpaks and point and shoot.
---
When I just want to get rid of junk legendaries because I‚Äôm near the script limits, I sell for 2 caps/script, so a 3-star Weapon is 80 caps. They usually go within an hour. 
---
For things that are actually valuable, I guess what I would be willing to pay if I wanted to use it, and price a little below that.
---
Hah I always thought it was the group jumpin around that burned my stealth, didnt think it was the in-combat flag. Thanks for this üç∫
---
I love that idea, maybe like this?
---
Responders - Forest
---
Blood Eagles - Ash Heap
---
BOS - Cranberry Bog
---
Commies - Mire
---
Enclave - Whitespring
---
I would think the JE would be better by a little at full hp. I ran about 40% health on my heavy gunner so it would be a decent bit more damage than the AA25 that way.
---
There's a way to legitimately farm xp in Glass Cavern. It was more worthwhile during the double xp event, but still probably the best way to get xp fast.
---
two shot limb dmg minigun with accelerated barrel works best as a magic weap for me - better than junkies ffr ultracite gatling laser for example. eat 3x formula P for accuracy (your reticle and bullet spread shrinks to a pinpoint) and watch her health dive bomb with consecutive headshots (having a good framerate helps). shotgun will be good once you can cripple her again... that is until they patch magic weaps
---
Why wait? Fire up a hard RP player faction and show Bethesda there is interest!
---
Let me tell you why, as a PvPer who would like your proposal very much, I think the answer must be nah.
---
Mainly, we're a minority, and until the PTS math comes and stuff behaves less erratically, we'll be extreme minority.
---
This is why the suggestions about PvP just all take casuals into considerations, and must be casual friendly.
---
A first step for casual-friendly PvP proposal is pushing for complete removal of PvP from adventure and a separate mode with no bonus for PvE activities, with ability to boost workshops that increases the cap and production rate, with limit to boosted workshops on a single server so people would compete over them.
---
What‚Äôs their incentive lol
---
Yeah, survival sucked. Maybe they could change the way PvP works? Re-balancing weapons and armor, ect.
---
PvP was even teased in 76's trailer, so I would love it to make a proper debut.
---
Did you play the pts yet?
---
You know, at first I thought the Maggie story line was kind of sweet, but you make a decent point. I wish there was a better reason for us to go into the mine that wasn't meta (you know, kill the giant Wendigo that--if it got out--would rampage across Appalachia). The Maggie thing would have a been a nice side quest in addition to something that justified the use of such destructive force. But now we are getting into almost a mini DLC, not just a new Event content.
---
Upvote for that GT.
---
Ooooo.
---
I only have a single bloody alt who doesnt get a lot of attention unless I get a new weapon so I'm not aware of the finer points of the breakdowns.  He just stays at 20 ish and that's all folks.
---
See now you got me thinking about putting on my junkie heavy main to take advantage of my trend of not healing until ~20 percent (higher if in peril)
---
Curse this information.
---
I ask myself that about a lot of things honestly, why they do dis, or don't do it.
---
Gonna save it as a display piece. I'll contact you if I get another (5% chance tho) unless you find one yourself ;)
---
Huh. I must've missed something. Only colossal I've ever fought was the one in the forest by cranberry bog after a nuke. I guess I should check out colossal problem sometime. I just need to change my build over from stealth sniper to bloodied stealth sniper.  
---
That, and be able to play for more than 5 minutes without the game disconnecting me for no reason.
---
I dont thing its really possible sadly. It would kinda be awkwardly standing around then the mine falls apart.  Idk. There no clear best way to do it. Either you miss all the screws and have a heartblasting race out, or you get all the stuff but any threat for the chase is just gone
---
No idea what the timer is, but I while i like that you have to escape, you should have a minute or two. That‚Äôs enough time for a photo and all the loot
---
Super mutants are a lot tankier in the pts.
---
Why a Harpoon gun tho? Surely a Wood axe or sledge woulda been more in line?
---
I wasn't really thinking who goes to which area since I didn't factor the lore into it but you hit the nail on the head right here
---
It'll be a hit for Halloween CAMPs, that's for sure.
---
So a survival server 2.0. I dig it, sounds nice.
---
As  a level 777 i officially hate this game. I play it all day, and theres nothing to do with all the loot, its so annoying! What am i gonna do with 1000 bullions and 3 trillion legendary weapons. I hate perk coins, and i dont even have them yet, but they make me so MAD! JFC IM SO MAD IM GONNA LOG IN RIGHT NOW AND RAGE GRIND AAAARRRRGGGG
---
/s
---
If you're a shotgun build your best bet is another shotgun
---
The biggest factor in sneak is your agility so any way you can increase that will help. The best armor for sneak is unyielding shadowed leather with one piece of harder to detect while sneaking and +1 agility on all pieces. You'll also want a fixer for the added bonus if possible. I don't think chameleon does anything for PvE and I'm not sure how much muffled actually helps. AngryTurtle has done some great videos on YouTube going into detail about what works.
---
Dafuq? Bethesda IS greedy, that's what drives capitalism slick. Greed also explains why every week we get a reskin of an existing asset while legitimate bugs and glitches we've been complaining about for almost 2 years are still fucked.
---
" What if you joined and it was just you (or you and another couple of guys) because the other group(s) filled? "  
---
This exact thing happened to myself and two friends last night. We ended up throwing in the towel just due to the resource costs involved at like half-health.
---
It's only a thrill the first few times though.  Then it's like any amusement park ride.  You know the whole thing by heart.
---
Yeah more interactions at Foundation and Crater would be great. After finishing the story, there‚Äôs literally no reason to go back to either locations unless you‚Äôre there for the gold bullion machine or the dailies.
---
I actually logged in earlier and saw it pop up so i joined in. It was alright.
---
Happy burfday!!!!üåàüåàüåà
---
Won‚Äôt work because there is no choice in this game. You can be friendly with everyone.
---
I'm pretty sure in the past, I had come across a Quad The Dragon before.  So it may not have always been this way, but it certainly has been for a while.
---
Thank you. I've checked his videos out and they are very good but just wanted to see what the community inputs are
---
And we might get it without infuriating casuals, which make it way more achievable. I'd prefer your version still, but it's not gonna happen.
---
The Free States hated the US government and didn't trust Vault Tec.
---
76ers are unlikely to be too eager to fill their ranks.
---
I dunno, my friend. I play FO76 as a theme park homage to the other games and just enjoy the ride. Any story or lore elements that make sense is just bonus for me. If you inspect too closely, very little in the game makes any real sense even for a Fallout universe. Events like SBQ fights or Violent Night really shouldn‚Äôt repeat, logically, as they result in boss kills. No way Ward, an ex raider, keeps his job losing all that gear to his former beer buddies. After putting down five or six runaway Crater kids, Rocksy shouldn‚Äôt really have as bad of an employee retention policy. Taking all the gold should make you enemies with at least the faction you betray. Nuking should result in real structural damage to buildings and terrain, not just a smoky radiation haze that magically makes plants valuable. If you step back, it‚Äôs all ... nonsense. But that‚Äôs what makes it fun.
---
There‚Äôs still year old bugs in game which still persist to this day, which have yet to be fixed. You think they care about some atom challenges not giving atoms? It sucks.
---
If you die at the end I believe you lose your junk and can't get back in for it.
---
It's RNG, but no one ever said that every effect was equally weighted.
---
Certainly, the countless Broadsiders would speak to that...
---
Yeah Insurgent is what I ended up using. Dont have the caravan outfit yet though.
---
You‚Äôre being an apologist, or at least coming across like one. 
---
Example of the same message, but with more tact: *‚ÄùThey definitely need to fix that!  Until they do, I recommend manually crafting Railroad Spikes instead. They only take Steel, and it‚Äôs a really common resource. You could always use your Ammo Points for 5.56, and sell that to players if you don‚Äôt plan to use it yourself!‚Äù*
---
Also, notice the lack of the **condescending eye roll emoji** in my example. Perhaps that contributed to the perceived negative tone of your post?  Maybe that‚Äôs why the ‚Äòother post‚Äô that‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs the cheapest ammo to craft is getting more upvotes?  Because it doesn‚Äôt have a snide tone?  üßê
---
I mean I got bored of games when I level up and going back to old zones you just 1 shot everything you know? I liked that you can go to every dlc zone and have a fun time killing creatures and questing is hard, it‚Äôd be boring if the quest was to kill a summoned monster that‚Äôs meant to be a powerhouse but you just one shot it. Seems like they can never win everything is too easy / players don‚Äôt like going to low level zones because loots bad so they make it so enemy‚Äôs are higher and loot scales and now it‚Äôs a grind etc
---
Minigun works well, high speed barrel does 209 fire rate. Not to mention if you aren't against getting the extra perks the heavy gunner damage perks are str just like shotgunner, so an easy swap.
---
I personally run bloodied heavy gunner, and I hit for 21 when in her face, so i build up the 1000 damage pretty quick.
---
If nothing more think of it this way, 209 fire rate, 2 full mags at 1 damage per hit with no misses and you get a drop.
---
Also don't be afraid to drop into a public team, if someone on the public team gets 1000 damage and you do damage as well, you should get a drop.
---
When I play, sometimes I've played 30 hours a week, but I also take breaks when the content runs out or I'm burned out from repetition. I am definitely a primary customer as far as I can imagine, and based on the amount of money I've spent, almost certainly.
---
I'm not aware of any fluff, although I tried to offer some context and elaboration in my comment.
---
Wouldn't you agree that the title "I would buy a lot more at the Atomic shop if all items were available all of the time." could be accurately paraphrased as "‚ÄòI wish I could buy whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted"?
---
In agreement with op. Nerf was needed. I recently changed to a bloodied build. It is great fun, and ammo efficient, but there may as well be no enemies in the game. Apart from the queen and imposter ss and scorched beasts, everything gets one shotted. I think the challenge with bosses in this game lies within the preparation for these fights. Do I have enough ammo, will my gear hold up, are my team set up for the fight etc... 
---
That been said, I don't think making bosses ammo sponges is the answer either. This seems to me a bit lazy on Bethesda's part. I think they should have done something similar to how encrypted is set up. Exploit a weakness to make the boss vulnerable, then lay into it. I think the mechanics of this event are perfect for this game. Just change it up a bit.
---
I would like to see Ward be more trusting of me. I retrieved a ton of their missing equipment, and provided a shitload of photos about the Raiders, with no compensation needed.
---
Get a combat shotty and put the range into negative Or use gauss shotgun. I have a shotty character and I never have a problem when I‚Äôm using either of those weapons.
---
No.  They should have kept the dailies giving out the atoms as usual DURING this thing.
---
But Todd wants his money and God forbid the players earn a measly amount of atoms.
---
I'd wager atom dailies are never coming back
---
Shotguns (I have two legendary ones) seem to do no damage to the SQB in the air.
---
Well, i have my ticket and ready to ride again. Hopefully the shiny vineer stays nice for a little while.
---
Also, if you want the exterior of your building to be wallpaper, you need to build your foundation out one block farther than you actually want to use it, likewise with upper floors. You can delete these extra foundations and floors after you get your building done, though I usually leave them in until I'm sure it's all set because you'll have to rip down whole portions of your building to replace them.
---
I keep wishing we had a fourth dialog choice for when we turn in the quest to Maggie:
---
"I found your father.  I skinned him and he's now a carpet in my living room.  Also, here's his pocketwatch."
---
shotguns are amazing at close range against most other enemies but i would not recommend it with any Scortchbeats. i have an instigators combat shotgun and at close range with VATS i can one shot most enemies with it. but i don't use it against the SBQ cause i don't like to be too close and its not very effective against any scortchbeast at far range. my go-to guns for that bitch are heavy builds.
---
my first pick is my Zealots Explosive .50 cal, backup one is Instigators Gatling Gun, but i have bloody mess, master and expert heavy gunners and it seems to do a damn good job.
---
How's your build? Since you should be doing the most damage with the guns you're specced for
---
Rubbish. The game‚Äôs problems keep stacking up which is why the mood has turned so sour. It‚Äôs well deserved. 
---
As for good news, if the devs can implement everything they talked about at Quakecon then that will indeed be good news. Right now it‚Äôs just pie in the sky, however.
---
Yes. I‚Äôm in the same boat. Just add it to the list of stuff they ‚Äúfixed‚Äù and actually didn‚Äôt.
---
That benefits the player too much, Todd would never go for that.
---
Or release both at the same time.
---
Thanks. I now have a reason to do that quest though. :) I was unsure if I should my astronaut lady yet... ;)
---
long time ago i thought the survivor holotapes were bugged until i found out that there's 2 different holotapes from Colonel in flatwoods, might want to double check you have both unless its bugged more recently.
---
I'm in the swamp, so ghouls, wendigos, and animals randomly wander into my camp, break my stuff, and leave.
---
I bow to you, oh great and wise one.
---
While you stack 'em old school, the cool kids use a different method.
---
Just because you don't know how to do it with blueprints, does not remove the possibility.
---
Well China did invade Alaska for oil in Fallout lore so I would imagine they were sharing the resource woes of the rest of the world and most likely wasn't much of a utopia.
---
Granted I can't point at any hard lore to state what the conditions were in the red countries or their history before the bombs fell in Fallout.  But I know in the real world that communist regimes have committed some of the worse crimes against humanity known.
---
Even to this day a number of communist countries are still committing atrocities.
---
Given the lack of any background of the conditions of life in the fictional red states that I can recall, leaves me to base my opinion of them on what I already known of the real world communist states.  Other wise I would imagine that if they wanted to paint a different narrative they would provide content to do so.
---
Akin to how you pointed out how America isn't perfect and is rather flawed in the game. They have presented that narrative within the game.  If they felt that the Reds in this setting were better than their real world counter parts it wouldn't take much effort for them to sprinkle tidbits here and there within the game series to paint said narrative.   But they haven't so I feel comfortable viewing the communists in game to be much like their real world counter parts.
---
Melee build.  My first purchases were SS underarmor and shielded lining. 15 DR, 15 RR, +4 STR, +4 &amp; +2 on two other attributes (I forget which ones)
---
Bought regular SS armor plans last night.
---
Ou of bullion - so back to the grind :)
---
IIRC, butressed is the best mod, but check one of the wikis, I could be wrong.
---
Just switch to a different weapon and back again.
---
Does that still do enough damage when you don't have any laser perks?
---
That looks terrible..... I'm so glad it's not out on consuls..... I hope it stays I've on pc for ever........
---
I have to admit, Maggie being so casual about launching a nuke *is* a very "wtf" dialog moment.  We went from dropping nukes being a big deal to being totally nonchalant about it.

Every now and then, the dialog goes meta like this.  Like when you confront the soldiers in the Ransacked Bunker, tell them you're a General in the Enclave, and they're all "Yeah, you and everyone else, apparently."  Well, now, wait a minute... are we saying that MODUS *literally* sends everyone on the same questline?  That's kind of bizarre, isn't it?
---
It doesn‚Äôt always work unfortunately.
---
Talking about making workshops more spicy, another person suggested that different factions have different controlled areas. 
---
Our solution:
---
So my idea is the following: Workshops in your factions area have a normal production rate but workshops in your enemies area have a boosted production rate.
---
Yeah why not? Why can't bethesda just do that?
---
You just want to get rewarded for the time you go afk to go make a sandwich!
---
&gt; my aa gattling laser or plasma
---
Looks like there is the problem, high capacity guns are required to reproduce the ammo bug. Have you tried to stash all your weapons and ammo, relof, and then equip only the rifles?
---
Yes.  Ive got the double fusion core duration and I can usually get enoug damage in in just 2 fusion cores.
---
But I belief!
---
We just have to keep reminding them, but yes some bugs even come from FO4.
---
Should add I don't even mind the atoms too much, it's just a completionist thing, those are about the only challenges I have left.
---
After knowing what Vault-Tec actually wanted us to do, I‚Äôd say a fair share of fellow 76‚Äôers don‚Äôt trust them either. Also the BoS doesn‚Äôt like the government (Enclave) but it has the largest ‚Äúfollowing‚Äù.
---
I want that grognak emote. Can never find it and it only appears that you can buy it with the bundle üòë
---
I died and I still had it, so idk
---
Hmm... That's always worked for me. Have you tried stashing your ammo and picking back up again?
---
What do you mean by "range into negative"? I got rid of the combat shotguns, because they did not do as much damage as my double shotguns.
---
What about the junk you looted? Will it still stay in our inventory after you black out?
---
SHIT! just bought it.
---
Oh, I did not know this, wiki lead me to the one in the Church, which doesn't complete it.
---
Where can I find the other one?
---
Now if it was an instanced event that would be good - no morons parked by your camp, you can choose to  take part or not, doesnt overspill onto the "normal" map, hostilities end when the event ends.
---
E.g. a vault is found, but is on the brink of collapse. Can join either BoS who are looking to salvage tech or Raiders who are there to loot.
---
Leave out the ‚ÄòYour marketing people are wrong‚Äô and it changes a lot.  That right there is an example of where you deviated from ‚Äòthis is just my opinion about my personal purchasing preferences‚Äô over to ‚Äòchange the system because you are wrong and making dumb choices‚Äô. 
---
That‚Äôs the ‚Äòfluff‚Äô I‚Äôm talking about. The moment you strayed into trying to tell them how to run their marketing, that was the problem. 
---
While I don‚Äôt agree with the practice, it‚Äôs proven to work as designed. Now, add in that they balance it out with items returning and having a discount?  They‚Äôre catering to multiple shopping styles.
---
Maybe.
---
Thanks, maybe that's the reason why I got any before. I am going with shotguns a long time now, but I never cared about the hit points earlier. Just activated that feature.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve tried everything. One day it worked, other day it didn‚Äôt. Only the rifles are affected. I only have rifles and gattlings. Maybe other pistols are broken too, I don‚Äôt know.
---
At the very least, show items and how long until they are available for purchase!  Being able to plan these things is better than the current "surprise!" system
---
Hey Rio, I never resale, I buy them to use them. I sell chems I loot to vendors for my daily caps not serums. 
---
Serums have either been duped or over produced or offered on sale as a community service to the point that you can find them for for sale at private vendors for 250 caps with very little effort. I have nothing to do not any control over the situation.  It is why that I have never crafted them and I don't sell them.  
---
I farm low level legendary gear and sell it cheap hopefully to contribute to the community.  Yes high level players buy it to script but so do low level players snI continue to provide the service.
---
This is the REAL issue. End game that takes ridiculous amounts of ammo, aid, and makes you have to repair almost everything you used in the fight needs to be rewarding. If the rewards suck, and I got the same amount of Xp as I would‚Äôve gotten from clearing Westek, why bother doing it.
---
That's fair, although I did try to qualify the statement by prefacing it with "I think".
---
I appreciate the explanation.
---
Wish list is a great idea. It would give Bethesda some idea of what's wanted, too.
---
My build is this one: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e864d65&amp;d=sp2sd2so2su2lt2p02pc2a72ic4ib4c72pq1eh2ej2s01iq2l71as2&amp;n=Quad%20Explosive%20Shotgun](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e864d65&amp;d=sp2sd2so2su2lt2p02pc2a72ic4ib4c72pq1eh2ej2s01iq2l71as2&amp;n=Quad%20Explosive%20Shotgun)
---
Communists and raiders.   
---
I don't know why Bethesda's art people are so into these factions. I don't even understand why they called a concrete bunker a communist bunker, and a fence communist?  
---
I kind of wish someone in the marketing department would tell them to chill out on the rhetoric and start producing more usable, neutral items.
---
You keep those justification for your greed and lying.
---
And now your following me so you can stalk me on here? Nope don‚Äôt think so.
---
I'm not sure but I will say these as much as I love the commie stuff I will say they need to add enclave stuff I think they have the less amount of items.
---
This will happen lol
---
The communist power armor in the atomic shop is 100% lorebreaking.
---
That would kinda be op
---
Sorry, i'm with the Enclave. WAR IS WHAT WE DO! That aside and onto the aspect of camps: 
---
Maybe your allies could repair your camp, which would improve teamwork(a bit)
---
OR we take another persons idea into consideration and slap PvP on a different server. Like survival, only different.
---
Public Teams have saved me from so many CTDs that it's almost the best the bonus it gives
---
Boy you‚Äôre stupid.
---
You‚Äôre welcome. And I appreciate the rational discussion, and commend you on your willingness to listen to other opinions and re-examine your own position. 
---
I respect that.
---
Neither recent nor a bug.
---
When you enter PA, your regular armor and backpack are removed.  If your armor is pocketed you lose that as well.
---
Ergo, weight gain and loss of carry capacity when entering PA is normal.
---
OTOH, if you have excavator with calibrated shocks, it is possible you carry capacity will increase, b/c excavator has a 100 carry weight bonus - calibrated shocks adds another 100 carry weight, for a total of 200.
---
Join or make a public events team, get your XP multipliers going, and hit events. I like to take workshops and then make my way through the reclaiming events since there's sometimes daily/weekly S.C.O.R.E. to be got, too.
---
I have run a berserker all year and it is the best fun. It requires a lot more inventory and perk management than other classes however. I started out using no armor at all but a vault suit and perks, I would switch into hazzy for rad zones and hooded rags for high damage. My game play has evolved as I began to understand the class more.
---
Max zerk damage will be achieved at exactly 0DR. If you DR is even 1 then your base damage will drop by 10%. If your DR is negative, you base damage will revert to normal.
---
I use medx addiction and Psycho addiction to drop my DR to (- 20). This allows me to wear a protective marine suit (+8 DR) and a full set of lv 1 shadowed leathers, the chest will be modded standard with whatever secondary mods you want (+12 DR). This combination of addictions and armor places you at exactly 0DR, granting full berserker base damage. If you are negative or positive you will lose your bonus; to see what your current DR is, then equip ironclad 2-- this perk will give you 20DR and nullify your addiction penalty so you can diagnose your DR problem. You can use a hazmat with Ironclad 2 to achieve max zerk damage using this combination as well since putting the hazzy on would put you negative. This is how you manage DR. I also run  semi auto rifles and pistols,  endurance and stealth perks but a lot of it is just "flavor".
---
To legitimately run a berserker without broken armor or going naked, you will need a second character - a lv 4 mule to dump extra trash legendary gear onto so you can eventually begin rolling 3* lv 1 armor at the purveyor. You can only acquire lv 1 armor (leather and wood) if you are sub lv 5, otherwise you will unlock the next lv tier gear and everything will be lv 5 and have slightly higher resistances than the lowest counterpart. Avoid anything that will give you xp, this includes discovering new locations, quests, public teams, building, cooking, and especially killing/tagging anything. You can also follow a friend on a private team who would kill things for you including legendary enemies, Enemy drops should scale to your level, however it becomes dreadfully boring not being able to shoot anything. Good for merchant RP though-- which is what I would do when I would do vendor runs on the low level. F1 is risky to do solo transfers in presently so I recommend using a friend to transfer as well.
---
I did this but on a private server. I went and captured 4 or 5 workshops then i started running the athletics course. And then when the workshops got taken i did the retake quest (easier than defending). And then i captured some more and went back to the athletics course. I did this until i had 15 workshops. i went through the levels silly fast.
---
Yes, I try everything. Nothing works. I thought of uninstalling the game but it‚Äôll prob take 142462 years to redownload. :/
---
its been a bug since the survival mode beta started that got worse when wastelanders dropped. as for 'tips and tricks' the only work around is to fast travel enough distance to remove the lock-up, but if your over encumbered or in the closed instance from colossal problem you're plain out of luck until Bethesda get off their backsides about it.
---
\- someone who's had to deal with this problem way longer than necessary
---
I think mostly you'll see people trying to stack up the mobs as close to the entrance as possible to create a rage loot situation. Which would actually make the event more difficult and exciti...... Wait a minute Bethesda.... are you putting it in the players hands to make your content fun and exciting...Again!!?? Noooo Waaaay!!
---
Thank you for the report, I'll raise this.
---
So I agree with you, but more than enclave stuff you need military camp stuff, it's a major hole in the atomic shop inventory.
---
Got one in a mole miners stash last night.
---
Noooo.

---
Yeppp always do the retake lol
---
could you be more specific about when you bought gold last? Because you're only allowed to buy once per week.
---
It's also pretty inelegant how escaping the mine spits you right out into a Nuke Zone.  Like, apparently no one thought that people without Power Armor might be participating in this event.
---
It's not even irradiated inside the cave.
---
And it's a Public Event, so it's not like the silo was being used as a gating mechanism to make sure only well-prepared players would participate.
---
Don't forget your Well Rested bonus, public teams, and the Canned food from Feed The People.
---
Yes, but not Raleigh Clay.
---
&gt;	/s
---
You dropped this
---
Only 2 groups can join per instance, 8 persons. You need to be on one of those or you will be sent to another instance, number of people determined how many are in the next 2 groups and so on.
---
Shotguns don't have the range to do damage in the air, except maybe the gauss shotgun. You can do damage to her on the ground, but you have to be practically in melee range to do decent damage and you don't want an explosive shotgun, so shotguns are not really very viable for the queen. You might be able to do a bloodied gauss shotgun and be effective, but otherwise, you're better off just using a heavy weapon.
---
I'm well aware that I'm often wrong, communication is imprecise, and there is always someone here that knows things that I do not. I try my best.
---
Sure, but it's absurd to think that people coming out of vault 76 are suddenly going to go complete flip and go full communist and join up with those folks.   
---
That is kind of the problem with all these communist atomic shop packs.
---
It is, but they've seriously fudged just how many "Motherlodes" are roaming around Appalachia.
---
I had great difficult doing this myself.
---
 I basically ended up putting a half wall and slanted roof attached to it down one square in front of where I wanted to put the slanted wall. I then proceeded to add the slanted wall on top of the roof that I had place in front.
---
I was then able to remove the new roof, and half wall, to effectively leave the slanted wall effectively 'floating' but it looked like it was attached to the original roof.
---
Sorry if this is confusing. It was hard enough for the build I was trying to do üòÖ
---
Well yeah obviously.
---
It's completely unheard of how this game has a steady stream of atom shop items but the in game factions have little to nothing to run on.
---
You can scrap cards?!
---
BOS?
---
Enclave?
---
I should mention that these walls can attach above roofs, not below them. Also, I am on Xbox, so i don't know if it would be any difference
---
I can absolutely understand your point. There are always 2 sides of the medal and you will never make everyone happy. 
---
The reason why I play mmos or rpgs is that I like to see my character evolving and get stronger. When all enemies scale to my character I don't really feel the progress. Why should I always lvl up / gear up when I still have to hit the fucking scaled molerat several times until it's dead. 
---
Just imagine how it looks when a level 300 guy in almost groll armor and with top tier weapon is struggling to kill some simple ghouls or molerats  because they are scaled lol. ( this will never happen I know but simple and especially easy to defeat enemies should be not a pain of a bullet sponge)
---
If you want them to add things then don't log in after completion. Their daily sign in numbers will drop and that will be the biggest motivator to give people who finished the season a reason to come back.
---
Go talk to Maggie in Foundation. When you enter the main compound take a right, you should see her (new NPC).
---
Ok, the fence thing I can live with cause even the rad roaches can't go under it but the bunker damm just a hurry-up job to get more money.
---
Maybe you would, maybe you only think you would. But years (at this point probably decades) of financial records say otherwise about the majority of people
---
Right, i should type a whole essay of obivious things, instead of 3 words.  People are offended too easy nowadays, being hurt by emoji
---
Yea that one hand been dropping loot for me and doesn‚Äôt even register as legendary when you kill him for daily challenges. The first time I thought I just killed him too fast.
---
The pop op needs to just be removed. Its annoying. Put it on the side destiny style.
---
Refresh is 20 hours after you buy your first item, same goes with bullion machine.  All vendors are in sync now, so 1400 every 20 hours is the limit.
---
 
---
Most world containers will hold things for what appears to be indefinitely.  I‚Äôve personally only had them reset once, and that was when I was joining a friends server to swap gear, so the friend may have jumped servers and I didn‚Äôt realize it.
---
These things dont really matter anymore to the people of the wasteland. Take the Shin from F2. All that got obliterated in the war.
---
Depends on if the event completed or not
---
Fair enough.
---
It's already explained that the same enemy will have 2 different levels in that case
---
When the enemy is being hit by the level 20 they're gonna be effectively scaled to an appropriate level for the damage they're doing, and the damage they'll deal to said level 20 player
---
But for the level 400 they'll be a level 100 enemy with appropriate hp/damage output against them
---
Vendor reset is client based, and resets every 20 hours after initial purchase. The loot thing is a coin flip.
---
If you‚Äôre going to whine about downvotes, then yes, you *should* put more effort into your posts. 
---
You typed a quick little snarky throwaway comment. What did you expect? Adulations and Applause?
---
You can put a few mods to drop range into the negative. That gives you unlimited range in vats. You‚Äôll always be at 95%. I do that while she‚Äôs in the air than swap to gauss when she lands. 8 shots from gauss at close range should be enough to break the damage threshold for loot.
---
It funny I have a friend that always making crazy trade and has tons of cap on alt
---
Vendors reset about 20 hours after your first transaction, I'm not sure about the containers though.
---
I wanted to thank everyone who has given my ideas on what to do and I and going to try out all of them and see what works best.
---
Try fixing your build so you arent over encumbered in chinese stealth suit.
---
Leave all your crap at home and take the fight more seriously so you wont have this issue again maybe?
---
Really? I placed mine on concrete foundations to give it a level surface.
---
I had plans for zero but higher level people would come by and take em all. It seems like 5 caps is to much
---
I just spit my drink. LMAO
---
Does this help kick off a colossus quest?
---
You're not the only one to notice. Add to the giant list.
---
| not that big of a deal to go to one of the 2... 
---
It can be if you are overencumbered.
---
Usually fixed by server hopping, then once you go back in speak to the Duchess first, then go and try to buy.
---
Ur mom is an amazing screw farm!
---
I jest. I'm sure your mother is an amazing woman. I just saw the setup for the joke and have no self control.
---
Nah, the unyielding armor I normally wear works just fine.  Cheers.
---
I don't run full stealth, but I find that just having the Chinese Stealth suit and then putting in 1 sneak and 3 Ninja allows me to smack the queen in the face a bunch of times before she notices me and even then it's usually a stupid mirelurk spawn or something that aggros me. If you want to never be found, then you you want the shadowed armor, etc., but for general purposes that stealth suit and the sneak perk is usually all you need.
---
I'm not, you were just acting like an ass to OP.
---
I did it for the first time yesterday. I guess I got coupled with a good group (I wasn't on a team till I hooked up with one at the event). It was maybe 10-15 minutes? Not too awful. I pumped a good amount of .50 into it but not as much as I usually blow on the SBQ.
---
The only thing that annoyed me was the time limit mibe collapse. I wanted to loot all the wedigos I'd killed.
---
Reading posts now that the only penalty for dying is losing your junk, I'm going to bring a scrap kit with and loot till just before collapse, then use the scrap kit to store all those screws before my demise.
---
not to put a damper on a pretty good thread here or anything but I'm sure this feedback would've been much more useful if it was submitted while the event was on the PTS, because that's what it's for, and it might've released with this change
---
Everyone‚Äôs got their roles nothing wrong with pointing out that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not just QA and Devs battling it out there are other roles there to support them for the best end product. Seemed like folks were getting a little too focused on us/them instead of ‚Äòwe‚Äô
---
I wanna pet Chally the Moo-Moo and maybe Bessie Too &gt;.&gt;
---
It‚Äôs a common problem with games that have a decent longevity, I personally think eso did fine mostly because yes everything is scaled but if you optimize you can still nuke creatures, I‚Äôve on my DPS fought a enemy that took say 10 hits and I‚Äôve watched another dps come in and wipe 4 creatures in 3 hits, if you truly optimize you can still nuke things, just as long as they don‚Äôt make say ghouls take 500+ shots I‚Äôm fine lol I‚Äôm just curious if they‚Äôll change how conditions on creature limbs work, if they‚Äôll add more to them or what because it‚Äôll open up a lot more crippling arms / legs. I also feel like death claws should be tough you should have to sink shot after shot into them not just one tap em.
---
If you are in a team, somehow unlock your game via either restarting the game or fast travelling away. If you are in the same instance as your teammate you can fast travel on them and you will be back in the instance.
---
Actually..its not an issue. Per the way it's supposed to work..
---
So let's say you are 400, and you have a lvl20 friend with you.
---
Yall go to West Tec.
---
The enemies will appear probably as 75..to YOU. But to him, they will be much lower,  like say 15 or 20.
---
Same enemily technically exists in two realities. You both damage it appropriate to your level and it damages you thr same way.
---
So no more absolutely smashing that level15 super mutant, but also that super mutant isnt going to be lvl 68 and just destroy your low leveled friend.
---
Again, that's the design. Let's see how it plays out.
---
How would that be op, getting an extra xp is not op
---
I don't remember typewriters in sugar grove. Lots and lots of clipboards and fans though.
---
Oh thanks!
---
Or refill the coffee cop and a smoke.
---
think it would be worth it to carry some scrap kits?
---
its been a long time..... if memory serves right, get onto the bridge near the pool nearby flatwoods, follow the road in the direction heading into flatwoods, his body is on one of the houses with a porch on the left hand side. hes a bit tucked out of the way up there so you don't really see the corpse from the road though
---
Well, new.. there has been one to glitch weapon their magazines, and another which uses the glitched NW lasers which I think basically make your magazine as big as the amount of ammo you have.
---
Thanks for the tip!  Didn't occur to me that you could fast travel to a friend, or team member, to get back in.
---
I mean, in general I think it's a cool new fight. It has a borderlands-esque entry (drop down into the mine) which was neat. The escape the mine collapse trope was exciting the first time. New plans are very exciting and I want them.
---
However I was a little surprised at how brief the background story of it was... 
---
A quick chat with a new NPC. Then she straight up says, 'Hey, y'all been nukin' the shit out of Appalachia, might as well try nukin' the mine!' and we do so... Enter it. Listen to a few tapes. Boss fight ensues. Ends. Loot. Rinse. Repeat?
---
All in all, its a change from SBQ. It's repeatable, high XP. I'm just surprised it's been such a slog to get this kind of content.
---
Yes, the blackout is not a death.
---
You have to get back to the same server and then hope no one loots said container.
---
It really does look awesome. I hope visually it looks as good on Xbox
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Dude, you've triggered all the peeps that still give into the microtransactions :(
---
Lol sounds fun!
---
They could have at least transported us to vault 76. They know we all really hate that.
---
Why the hell are people down voting this? It's a legitimate question.
---
I did the event six times last night, and not once had any issues getting to the event. Shit show is a bit of a stretch.
---
Ah yes. The one where you quick switch and shoot at the same time to get the ammo capacity of the gun you switched from.
---
If you can make room in your stash for some variation of Gatling Laser and a handful of Fusion Cores, you don't need to Respec.  Each Core is 500 shots, doing about 5 points of damage each to the Queen (after her 70% DR). Of you can connect with half of the shots from a single core, you should break 1000.
---
Just remember to dump any Core under 75% afterward.  It's not worth it to have to carry undercharged Cores for one instance in the game.
---
The problem I have is that difficulty is centred around bosses resistance rather than mechanics or damage. Hell, with colossal problem, I'm more scared of the wendigos than the colossus because they're the ones often doing the damage. The first time I tried colossal problem, I went in with a casual heavy build and did practically nothing. Since then I've been using a bloodied build just for some resemblance of balance.
---
Yep! That'll direct you where to go/what to do next. 
---
Or, if you see the event pop up you should be able to jump right in, if you're into that sort of thing.
---
Since it still pops up during Breach &amp; Clear event, I'd say it lives.
---
Or the lvl 100 Chinese Infiltrator bots that can one shot you from the other side of the map.
---
ahahahaahaha
---
Nope.console
---
At first I thought I was just supposed to mini-nuke the entrance or something.
---
But then no...a nuke nuke. lol
---
Also the whole premise that we can just keep nuking areas with no actual damage to said area is kind of annoying to me sometimes. I just shrug it off but honestly it would be much cooler if they had a designated nuke area kind of like the Glowing Sea where the SBQ and now the Colossus events would spawn.
---
I know that if you have e.g. 2 handmades, one normal and one ultracite it will bug out. Also unfavorite the other etc.
---
Are you saying there are decades of financial records regarding microtransactions? I don't understand.
---
That's so silly, how is that a thing
---
Super mutants lv 75/100 have much more DR than the ones in live servers. So even if it says that you have 110 damage with a handmade, if you shoot the body, it will do at least half of it.
---
Yeah I'm really looking forward to getting in there and giving it a go
---
nukes are a joke in this game which i think is completely against the premise of fallout as a series. when you nuke megaton you really feel like you did some serious shit that affected the world. ESPECIALLY when you see Moira doesnt die. this game its just for fun
---
Ok I‚Äôll try that. Maybe I should log off without my rifles on me. I haven‚Äôt tried that yet.
---
Bashing damage.. so they made it magical? Lol
---
Great pics!
---
It was completed. I kinda just sat there at the end bc I couldnt remeber where the exit was and I got the rewards and I still had my junk. COulda been a fluke tho.
---
Also true haha.
---
This would be interesting to know because I also think crippling will be a big (or bigger then now) thing when the scale drops like it is atm.
---
There are a few creatures that just need some buffs and I would be happy. Claws, Yao guais, mega sloths... everything that is by far bigger then you shouldnt die in one hit that's true.
---
But molerats lvl 100? Na thanks lol
---
Take off the bottom (or keyboard, whichever is appropriate) to access the internals.
---
Verify the cooling vents are not clogged.  Verify the fan is not obstructed.  Verify the heat sinks are not crude up.
---
I‚Äôve seen more than one laptop kill itself from the video card/processor overheating the system b/c of clogged vents and/or dust bunnies inside the case.
---
Yeah, not sure how the NW one goes though.
---
As long as we can farm screws and keep em if we die and that doesnt get gimped :)
---
Any fix for this as just got it
---
Thank you!
---
There's always been one in the room before you get the overseers cache. Always wondered myself why it drops nothing.
---
I just launched a nuke got to the mine and it's still sealed can't say i'm not surprised though
---
I usually drop stuff for new players when I have too much of something like stims, rad away, and plans plus the occasional low lvl legendary.
---
But sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell if someone is new because they may be using a toon for item transfer or something.
---
Hmm wondering if a flechette harpoon is viable now with the fireworks reload speed glitch.
---
Never underestimate the generosity of others. There was a player that developed a character that was like a panhandler. He hung out in flatwoods and the higher level players would shower him with stuff.
---
Strange I've never seen it until today, it's weird lol
---
agreed. Although I'll never do this solo. :)
---
I killed the WC a month ago for the first time after killing the SBQ. Hell no. I will not be bothering with this boss. Its not fun farming all day for ammo to burn. This is a screw event as far as I'm concerned.
---
He's a damned sponge. Twice now I've tried and failed to complete in time. You really need a number of high level players or it's impossible.
---
You just said when you wear youre in chinese armor you go over encumbered and carry scrip fodder and food  i use unyielding too and personally think its better than thinking its better to use the stealth suit. Maybe you misread my response based on what you wrote initially. 
---
Also dont take it as an personal attack. Peopel need to fix their builds sometimes jts a thing you should get used to, learn to adapt and accept that not everyone build is perfect and can have its own set of flaws ie carrying  too much stuff they might need but actually dont need at all.
---
I dont whine, i dont give a feck about internet points, just pointing about other person saying basically the same thing, being upvoted, as pretty usual for reddit
---
Well hopefully your build works for you during the event. I apologize if it came off like an anti bloodied build reply. I have no issue with bloodied builds. My reply was more towards the is it fun question you asked. the whole event could be a total nightmare for bloodied builds for all i know. Thought it would be nice to give you a heads up. I made that mistake with my vats commando. Definitely need to tweek my gear before he goes back in the mine. 
---
I don‚Äôt really follow youtubers so ill take your word for it on angryturtle. I know watched someone play it on youtube before i did the event yesterday and they mentioned it was rather hard for bloodied to survive in it. I don‚Äôt know who I watched because I just loaded the first decent video i found to make sure their wasn‚Äôt any major game breaking  glitches with this event. Things like having my inventory completely vanish.
---
Esp now with the Score alot of people just using new ones for those 500 points
---
I've dropped a loot bag as well as deposited in a public container, quit the world, swap characters, re-join the same server, and then go pick up what I dropped or dumped into a container.
---
I wouldn't gamble with the time limit though. If you need to do this, be quick about it.
---
Yep, phones, clipboards, globes in Sugar Grove.
---
So it has to be in ...
---
Then it was the player icon i believe
---
Wow thanks, iv played this game since launch and there‚Äôs still loads of stuff I don‚Äôt know
---
If you‚Äôre ever looking for a great group of people try joining one of the more specific subs like for building or RP. Everyone there just genuinely enjoys the game and wants to see other love it too. Even if those aren‚Äôt your thing, it‚Äôs nice to take a break and just see people thriving despite all the bugs and slow content!
---
In bless unleashed if you complete the bless pass ( which is their version of the run ) early you get gems for every challenge that you complete after the pass is done. Then when the time limit for the pass ends they take all the gems you accrued and turn them into star seeds which is the top tier end game currency. 
---
Because Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have a top tier end game currency they could turn them into atoms or scrip or gold bullion. Just an idea.
---
I know for me it at least would be something. I finished my run about a week and a half ago but still log in every day and do the challenges out of habit and a few of my friends haven‚Äôt finished it yet. This would at least incentivize people like me to keep logging in.
---
I mean getting 100% xp consistently would just throw off the entire game.
---
The cat even jumps up and down from tabletops :') Let me pet the good ket!
---
I do think mole rats should cap at 50 same as any sorta small creature, I hope crippling becomes a bigger factor just because I feel like you would need more people working as a team or you could actually spec into those stats, game needs more options as far as builds go, I can‚Äôt say much because I run bloodied but I enjoy the thrill of being almost dead all the time plus I run bloodied heavy lol, but all and all small creatures should cap at 50 so everyone can still get max tier rewards, personally I feel like one wasteland will bring me back into the game now we just need ZOS to show them how to make an expansion lol
---
daredevil suit? it's indeed an atom shop item.
---
I finde them daily in the nuclear command centers, more than I can turn in.
---
Clutch Nixon came to your camp?  Awesome.  How was he in person?
---
It‚Äôs the Daredevil suit.
---
No idea. I do like the idea of having a legendary at the end of the airport though. I probably should submit a bug report.
---
It seems like they're just talking about the fast travel bug and downvoting me for having the audacity to say what happens when you can map properly. There was an issue right at the start but it got a hot fix. Good ol reddit lol.
---
IDK that Specific scenario, but I Can tell you the L42 glowing wendigo at WS golf club does not take too many hits from a ghoul slayers switchblade before it dies...
---
I‚Äôve put loot into a container and played for hours and the loot was still there. It will also stay after you leave the server.
---
I saw some folks discussing AA as an option too. Even something like the Final Word 50 call could work.
---
Buy a regular gatling plasma from the Enclave, it‚Äôll work just fine.  The distance is too far for a shotgun, unless shes landed and the explosive part is not effective.  I see people using gauss shotties but half of their damage is explosive also.
---
Nooooo!
---
 True! Thanks for the tip, I‚Äôll have to give it a look.
---
Same but it can't be placed on just foundations
---
It's just the garage door sound recycled. I think it's a lot of laziness
---
Very well is only 25 percent it only stacks to 100 with 4 lunchboxes, if you rest for 15 mins and get 25 percent it would not be bad, plus there are enough items to boost xp that going up a level is not a big deal, and it would be something everyone could use, so no it would not be ok.
---
Have fun with the most annoying bullet sponge ever.
---
I started out the exact same with you, it just comes down to situational awareness, you can't touch the pools, you can't go near the barrels on the walls, and you can't stand where the sparks rain down
---
I mean they thought the idea of launching nukes was fun in-itself, or no?
---
if you want to just see it as a gating mechanism and it's boring to you because you did 100 times i get that as well. I haven't done the run that many times so maybe i don't see the problem as you do.
---
yes the rushed nature at the end really is not fun. I am only looting the boss if I can (I couldn't find a body once), not looting any adds and barely able to make it out if I can find the way out at all. so not fun.
---
 during the fight...if people don't take out adds I ended up dying, repeatedly during the fight. I play melee unarmed (junkies, no bloodied) but because I died and it's in a nuke zone I put on power armor ...I don't have gun specs or points there. so I feel absolutely useless. 
---
first two runs I could not find the exit and died to a swarm of wendigo, spawned outside in the nuke zone, luckily in power armor and got the credit without dying.
---
my third run was me dying 4-5 times in the fight due to being feared into burning fire, wendigo swarms, or falling stuff while also going through probably 30 stim packs and running out of ammo plus having three weapons break...we almost didn't kill him in the timer.
---
the fourth run was great, someone had missiles and aoe for the adds and everyone focused the boss and got him down fast.
---
it still sucks rushing at the end and barely even making the timer ...and I only looted the boss, nothing else.
---
Thanks so much for answering this question for this player. I haven't claimed the Gold Bullion, on the Legendary Run,  because I was afraid I'd not receive it.  Now I can clean up the rewards. Thank You Thank You Thank You !!! A Million times Thank You!!!!!!
---
Except the raiders
---
Decades plural as in more than one, but not fully two. I remember it going back quite far, I saw my brother buying avatars or whatever on his xbox ~13 years ago. I remember they often had exclusive ones for certain games or events. Not sure how much data they'd keep on something like that, but probably at least some. The exact model that we are more familiar with, a full $60 game with an in-game store for cosmetics, has been around for a few years though and there is no doubt that they keep extensive records on sales now. However, although this exact idea that we now know as microtransactions has only really been possible for the past 15 or so years, the general ideas behind this have been well tested for many decades. Your local department stores, theaters, candy brands, etc. were already messing around with timed exclusives in the 1980s
---
So what I hear you saying is that this is a colossal problem?
---
Thats actually the AA I've been using lol. I finished the quest after I leveled to 50 so its pretty decent
---
By the way... I just realized... lol
---
I did the event twice in a row last night in your instance... so... \*waves\*
---
Honestly I never considered that might be "bloat". I'd think costumy things like Fasnacht masks would actually be more likely to sell than most armors. Decorative plans are the #1 sellers as far as I can tell, why wouldn't cosmetic gear be a big seller too?
---
Yeah, it also doesn't help that I'm now hesitant to buy anything new until I see feedback on here.  I was looking forward to the bunker after seeing it in the ATX datamines, but I think I'll be saving my atoms for now.
---
Mod a shotgun for range and accuracy, equip crippling shotgun perk (can't recall name right now). One shot and it stays still til you down it.
---
Apologies.  I responded that way because of the fix your build comment.  The Chinese stealth suit use comes at the end.  It's hazmat suit really.  But it has no bonuses.  Put it on and I cannot leave.  The nuke zone is just a inconvenience really.
---
Most of the weight is scrip fodder because of useless daily limits.  I'm not going to abandon what I worked for because of arbitrary limits.  The equipment fills in the gaps when I cannot play enough to get to the limit. (Cap fodder also)
---
The rest of ammo and food.  I carry a lot of food because the buffs are extremely useful and I make it once a week.  No use storing it when I have to use it out and about, plus it'll go bad without my perks.
---
Most of my storage is used by a rotating stock of items I'm selling, so my stash is basically useless in that regard.
---
When I'm wearing the interesting I have about 200 lbs free.  It's great.  Take off the different weight reducing armor pieces though, and it's like a marshmallow in a microwave.
---
As one of the few who enjoyed the vault raids I probably will üòä
---
The Appalachian brotherhood weren't working with the people at the start more like demanding at gunpoint. Maxson is still alive and I doubt the brotherhood faction still loyal to him will go against his orders but the other ones might. That's why it's called fractured steel
---
The VATs is weird, granted. 
---
But I was in the same boat. Had a few friends that played but overall I had a real negative view of the game due to the launch and never looked back.
---
Recently it was on sale on steam and a friend told me I should get it. He could guarantee that there was atleast 20hrs of story content and I've always loved fallouts story. So I got it. July 16th...
---
I now have a lvl 152 and 32. Nearing 300hrs in.
---
Glad to see they did alot of work at fixing the cluster fuck the game was at launch and loving my time in it. And the people are awesome.
---
But with ESO the scaling system made it more about XP gains...difficulty never really scaled, it just pretty much stayed the same and it was about getting better gear. All the enemies are easy at least in overland. I personally like how ESO works, it's easy to grind overland enemies and get XP scaling with your level.
---
But this...this isn't quite what I was expecting from One Wasteland. This looks nothing like ESO's One Tamriel Scaling, this looks like it's gonna need some serious balance.
---
While I hate to refute such a well thought out and witty retort such as that I fail to see how wanting actual content for a half complete game that some people are paying 13 dollars a month for is greedy. But I will say charging money for mods that some guy wrote in his basement for free is pretty greedy.
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll check it out right away!
---
Yeah Taggerdy didn't like the idea as well
---
The escape timer is surprisingly tight.  I run like crazy and I get to the end with only maybe 30-40 seconds left?  If someone is overencumbered at the start, by the time they switch perks, they probably aren't going to make it.
---
But the worst part is just how hard it is to find the exit.  Why they chose to not have it stand out, except for a couple spinning lights, is beyond me.
---
Yeah it's weird nothing is mentioned of him at the end. If he was around Shannon's age, he'd be around 70-80 though. Maybe he could be tracked down, and you find him with Janet, one of the girls who was training to take over for him as an engineer.
---
&gt; The pop up windows aren't even working correctly, so I usually get the legendary notification way later, or, worse yet, in the middle of fighting for my life (I love aiming at an anorexic wendigo with a nocturnal flamer taking up my entire screen).
---
I've been noticing this for a few weeks now. A legendary drop may not show up and the next time there is a similar notification (the one that takes up the whole center screen) it'll be the legendary drop instead of whatever it should be.
---
I'm the *most* casual player of this game possible and even I'd buy out a stock of 3 stars for 15 caps each just to vending machine without hesitation. You've got to at least match what Mmmuargahh will give you in funnymunny.
---
I'm normally sorting by weight... but that's a good answer.
---
And feel pretty stupid for not thinking of it (considering I already do things like that - for ordering purposes elsewhere)
---
The only possible thing I can think of is that it is there as a kind of tutorial. If you follow the vanilla story it is the first place you are sent to that has enemies to fight, so maybe it's there to teach you the way legendaries mutate. Just a guess.
---
But... that's what pisses me off.  They have skins for the combat shotgun.  They just aren't available for sale now
---
Also a lot of people are gonna be even more pissed when they find out this is the only free season and the rest are going to have pay walls.
---
That most mats, even fusion cores, are relatively easy to come by.  Unlike previous fallouts, you don‚Äôt need to loot and carry everything you see.
---
Sell you excess to bots.
---
Most high level players are good guys.  Dont run away when we approach.
---
If you have a mic, use it.
---
&gt; Nuking should result in real structural damage to buildings and terrain, not just a smoky radiation haze that magically makes plants valuable.
---
I remember before FO76 came out and they were showing off teaser footage of a nuke. They nuked Charleston and so of course gave off the impression that nuking would actually damage the environment. I was so disappointed when I realized that wasn't the case.
---
Yeah, probably. 
---
Lore could be incomplete or skewed though,  considering how little info we have on Fallout China apart from that shown in the Anchorage simulation, which was a piece of propaganda art designed to train and indoctrinate soldiers.
---
Having a bunch of stealth suited agents down there at the communist base could be fun as an alternative.
---
I placed my second 1 fine. Only a slight corner floating and I didnt put much effort in.
---
Because it sunk in the ground abit I don't notice the floating furniture too much
---
I‚Äôll take anything that looks cool regardless of what faction it‚Äôs loosely (sometimes extremely loosely) tied to. A badass dome bunker, barbed wire fences? Dude, you could tell me those are the Brony faction items idgaf
---
Hm good to know will have to give that converter thing a try
---
It took me 50+ levels to realize I could rename my power armor. I was constantly guessing what was what.
---
I‚Äôd suggest waiting until the weekend before intentioanlly working on the weeklys - double score and all that....
---
Cheap ass b\*d didn't buy any merch!  Probably not dangerous enough for his tastes  :)
---
Yea know with public teams and the public events it could be cool to cooperate more with other players to take enemies down. Lvl sounds also good for the loot.
---
I play also bloodied. It makes at least in endgame the game a bit more challenging just running around with 15% health.
---
Absolutely haha
---
Timed offers and limited offers are of course not a new thing, although this has often been driven by the nature of manufacturing and manufacturing runs, as far as I'm aware. That's as it relates to physical goods anyway.
---
Did the Xbox have things like avatars that were removed from the store, then reintroduced? If so, I was not aware of that.
---
I've seen cosmetics in some more recent pc console games, but did not notice if items were coming and going.
---
and the little "exit" sign nailed to the doorway... LOL
---
You are sol my friend
---
oh, no kidding on that.  I scraped quite a few power armor frames before I found out I could rename it.
---
Gum drops are not gum though
---
Support will do nothing,   this is what they told me in my ticket,    this is the second time this week i have had this bug.
---
Happened to me yesterday. I lost almost all daily and to make it worse almost all weekly challenges to auto complete.
---
Do you honestly believe it wasn't?
---
Same, I was logged in when the challenges reset and all but two of my dailies were auto completed with no score.
---
Really bummed as I was excited to grind them out!
---
Bummer. I was hopeful it dropped while you‚Äôre downed, but I guess there‚Äôs something to be said for having the satisfaction of an actual last laugh. Knowing I made someone across the Internet swear at their TV sounds more worth it than 20 points XP, actually.
---
That's very true. Many items which look really good end up being huge disappointments, some are apparently never fixed.
---
Then it is a last laugh indeed.
---
this is what I came in to post..
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a daredevil outfit I have had it forever now
---
Maybe an easier solution to hit a wider spectrum of items would be "Eat Candy"
---
Wow I thought the whitsprings vendor hated me, he just really doesn't like anyone üòÇ
---
They are outfits now. You craft them as under armour, but if you had one stashed, it is an outfit.
---
That‚Äôs a separate challenge and gumdrops do count for that
---
&gt; it's time for inventory management
---
This game has been 90% this for me so far which is why I can't get more into it than I have.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen with a gutsy before. Said legendary but didn‚Äôt have no stars and no loot
---
This. If you have a friend on the server as an anchor you can potentially transfer items this easy but it's a risk.
---
They should have at least one skin available for every item all the time. This is actually what motivated my post.
---
They have been appearing more often. I think we are header for an invasion. (Or another Bethesda glitching)
---
are you kidding?! that costume is moovelous!
---
Worse rewards?
---
Pre-War Food?
---
This issue has been happening for weeks, to many players. There is no known cause, there is no fix, and those points are gone forever.
---
What if they made it so points for challenges completed after the Legendary Run would carry over to the next season?
---
Actually good advice for me. As a bloodied sneak unarmed build I frequently die at the end of Queen fights, died at the same time as the queen dozens of times. When I see her health getting really low I have a tendency to get tunnel vision and start swinging like crazy without keeping an eye on my health/rads and danger indicator.
---
Haven't tried the event yet, but are melee builds worthless in the fight or would there be value to having me there? I'm optimized for melee but carry several guns as well.
---
Same , had to start a break a couple months ago. Now I been checking to see how high the flames are reaching out of the dumpster. I love the game , and have played through some crazy bugginess. I will be back. Just gonna be awhile.
---
It got patched yesterday as part of the Colossal Problem patch for PC users
---
Noticed once mine dropped when I was downed. Not dead
---
Otherwise not having much luck with it. May try the explosive perks
---
Or simply we still get score but it tallies up to about 3000 and then a random wheel selects between caps, xp, atoms, bullion etc
---
That‚Äôs another challenge that it also counts for
---
Fissure Prime is sooo basic, I mean I'll go anytime it's nuked because it's good for Violet Flux. Whitesprings is better, I've gotten better Legendaries off of Random Spawns there. I personally prefer Harper's Ferry, but next Nuke I launch I'm going after Morgantown, I've heard it's on average the best place to Nuke for Flux and Critters to drop HRF, HM and GM.
---
Stop giving Bethesda excuses to avoid fixing this bug.
---
I can still use the motherload as a taxi from the Hole and back and across the map.
---
there is. just google 'fallout 76 reddit market'
---
it cannot be linked here due to mysterious reasons.
---
Certain items can be used for more than one recipe, the only issue I see with this.
---
Pls. This.
---
I'd want some kind of hybrid of wearing my outfit, such as the treasure hunter outfit, but be able to add some armor pieces as cosmetic only. So I could wear my Secret Service armor, treasure hunter outfit, and a leather chest piece to add a bandolier to the outfit.
---
Always talk to dutchess first.
---
Same with me. I couldn't tell if it would go off immediately or if it wouldn't just drop one, or if I needed to have one equipped. I haven't taken it off yet because: I either don't play it enough to bother, or I keep hoping it'll work.
---
it's a simple enough bug to perform that nets you a ammo factory on your camp as opposed to the workshop.
---
it cannot be removed and even if you move it detracts from your budget permanently.
---
although people say if you move enough times it'll clear.
---
One person figured out the exploit. Told someone else. Who told someone else ect...it's not even a difficult exploit really.
---
It‚Äôs an exploit specific to the ammo factory at the ammo workshop. It‚Äôs against sub rules to detail out or support an exploit.
---
Is it under 250 atoms cuz I'm pretty sure that's all I got lol
---
So is there a chance to drop the nuke and not be able to get in on it yourself?
---
I think its 250
---
Fewer flux, no repair kits, way more work to kill.
---
LOL I agree, the foundation just seems boring and full of bored people banging on walls.
---
It‚Äôs just a bug that allows you to keep the plans for crafting one. It‚Äôs been advised you don‚Äôt get it as Bethesda could ban you and even, if they don‚Äôt it can‚Äôt be moved or deleted so if you change camps it will become an invisible drain on your budget and you have no way to remove it other then admitting to support you performed the exploit.
---
It's unfortunate they're adding content that will push more people towards hacks and exploits just to keep up.
---
The fact that not everything available at all times is why I end up checking out the store regularly, I wouldn't be going there and spending my atoms as  as often if I knew everything was available at all times. I like it the way it is, with enough essentials they do keep up 100% of the time (repair kits).
---
People love holidays in games. Always have, seemingly always will. Holiday decor and costumes are just always popular even if they are silly. Fasnacht might have been extra popular this year since it was during peak early quarantine for a lot of people?
---
Had it happen to me yesterday, half of the weeklies and 5 of the dailies.  Sadly i know there is nothing to be done, apart from grumble in the corner and carry on.
---
I agree, going for the trunk is ok for your first run. I found it fun running for my life thru the mine. But its more practical to just stay and loot the wendigos.
---
If you're the first person on a server instance to try it then it works.
---
Make a friend with fallout 1st and do it on a private server
---
Yeah but that's be really dumb to not reward you for Killing it, it could be pretty hard at low low levels
---
So lame
---
Skyrim did not sell 20 million on steam so your math is off.
---
^ dude knows their shit. ESET, no Kapersky though.
---
I'm with you there ... was very disappointed to read the fatigues were going back to being underarmor.
---
Probably best tbh, the new event is a bit meh in my opinion so you'd not be missing much anyway.
---
I am looking foreword to meat week though, at least for Grahm and chally.
---
It can‚Äôt be a motherlode without cute widdle babylodes... um, that‚Äôs a technical term that might sound like something else to the... unsophisticated.
---
Oof
---
Can confirm moving camp several times will clear out the ghost budget.
---
It's more complicated than that
---
Why didn‚Äôt you send this directly to the mods instead of making a post? ü§°
---
I aint lying tho. Also you dont have any more excuses to defend bethesda? Thats nice. But stull your calling me greedy for the chance to get a currency that we used to be able to get when your not calling bethesda greedy for creating a system that *forces* their players to give them money for all new base items. Stop spending money on atoms for a while and see how you feel about the atom shop then.
---
And your not even talking about bethesda now your just attacking me. Thats sweet.
---
I think it will start next week. I was looking everywhere myself.
---
I like how colossal problem is a colossal problem.
---
If its actually good stuff.
---
Depends on the weapon. Mutants weapons will perform close to the same, while bloodieds will be at 1/4 to half their current dmg. All you need to do to find out is take your weapon‚Äôs base dmg, add in all your dmg boosting perks/effects/etc. into a single % and multiple that by your base dmg. 
---
The current PTS is also extremely jacked with how its calculations, so the current weapon dmg on some items in wrong.
---
It got rescheduled until tomorrow the 20th I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Because Lou couldn‚Äôt be bothered to come and help us.
---
Aww man, cheers mate.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the one down in the deep!
---
I don't disagree, just a theory, probably way off! We'll never know lol
---
I guess for me it's the opposite. If I spend time at a store, any store, that doesn't have anything I want to buy, I stop going there. Disappointment doesn't make me go back more often.
---
I have been conditioned to ignore the Atomic shop.
---
This is how I am. All plans range from 10-50 caps with a few at 100 caps. I've sold 1 thing for 1k and that was a 90% weight reduced minigun. I'd much rather see people get the plans they want then make some extra caps I don't need.
---
What bonus loot are you referring too? the event rewards?
---
Happy birthday fellow wastelander.
---
Hah small world. Those events went real smooth. I even got Earl's heads to display at my camp from one of them.
---
Yeah, it works OK. Still prefer a 50cal though.
---
**Should be tomorrow. 
---
(But who really knows anymore)
---
You‚Äôre a nuclear fallout survivor, Harry!
---
That's a good shout but I like to stay in a world to get some vendor sales too - it was about 30 mins for my weekly too but I had to kill a couple of people along the way... Most I got uncontested as everyone was doing the same thing just claiming then next.
---
Her damage resistance is extremely high in the air.
---
All of my items are ACME brand :)
---
No, no no, this is the first Harry Potter variant.
---
Starts tomorrow.
---
Here's the Fallout 76 website for those of you that need it.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
That's where all information can be found.
---
What they should do is make it so certain items are limited time, like fasnacht parade themed stuff, Christmas themed stuff, etc. and bundles regularly rotate through, but other than the themed stuff you could buy any item whenever you want
---
Tomorrow is the announced start date.
---
I do well against Scorchbeasts once they land. They can't hurt me much and my shotgun eats into them on the ground.
---
The National Radio Research Center has a lot of all those things, but I don't remember a single room with that much of it. It's a real good spot for screws though. Is it there /u/MaestroLogical? Or are you keeping your secrets?
---
It 100% CAN be removed, my friend made over 3 ammo bases. 1 base included 75 ammos that he said kept crashing server. He says he now has 20. He told me that when you move bases the budget weight does stay at first But all you have to do is change servers once you get towards the end where you can see the invisible budget. Once you change servers it resets budget. 
---
.... hope that clears things up. 
---
Also. Who doesn‚Äôt love more ammo??üéâüéäüéâ
---
Yeah, technically they aren't, they're more like Black Widow/Wonder Woman types in the style of a 20s flapper, but that's a bit harder to say.
---
Noice üëç
---
"You don't want to know where your father's pocketwatch has been."
---
I need to find a event team. Don't know what it is but I love jumping from event to event. Roam around for awhile, oh event.. time to go!
---
If the BoS fatigues are going back to being an under armor am I going to need to mod them to shielded again?
---
And Bethesda isn't?
---
If you think Earle is a bullet sponge now, just wait until they adjust the damage numbers in the upcoming patch.
---
Shit got called out
---
Unfortunately, it's quite unpopular to point out that bloodied is a broken mechanic. 
---
That said, I'd like to see how the changes on the PTS shake out -- swapping the effects to be additive instead of multiplicative may be enough to make some of the other build more viable by comparison.
---
I dont know as I'm on xbox. Didnt get that update yet
---
I honestly don't know what the hell you're saying here.
---
Yes. They're jellies with a granular sugar coat.
---
It pisses me off every time I see the loading screen that says ‚Äúevery train station has at least one vendor, blah blah blah‚Äù because beckley springs only has the machines. The scrip machine is the only one that you can trade in stuff you have on you. I‚Äôd like a vendor robot to move into the purveyor‚Äôs old spot.
---
Yh, just stay at the hourly event location.
---
.mmm
---
Yes, i don‚Äôt even play ‚Äúcolossal problem‚Äù and still get crash a lots compare to previous patch.
---
This patch is a mess.
---
They use FOMO to drive the store sales like they do to drive the legendary run. Bethesda is using the Fortnite play book to sell items instead of what's done in other games where items are available all the time. Funny since there is a subscription in this one that I clearly see a lot of players paying for so they're making money.
---
Yea you can as long as nobody kills you
---
Go to the area, find the oil barrels that can be played as drums. Play said drums. Stay there.
---
There are a bunch of them. We save # 3 in the story.
---
&gt;!The chinese have taken control of another and are using it to make an underground network of infiltration tunnels.!&lt;
---
Yes it is. If you're going to afk, park yourself on a drum or meat spit, at least that way you still are doing something towards trying to complete the event.
---
No one is saying it's not possible.
---
But legitimate speed kills of the Queen are few and far between.  The vast majority are coming from these exploit weapons.  And frankly, I think it's a bit degrading toward the people who manage to do it legitimately, with specific builds and buffs completely dedicated to that purpose, that you'd even try to draw that comparison with cheaters who get to do it with zero effort whatsoever.
---
You can, yes. But you have to either play the drums or rotate the meat. Don't just hide and not contribute. Meat Week relies on everyone contributing as much as possible.
---
Amazing screw farm tho.  Couple hundred every run
---
First run was my nuke, and I dunno who it was melted Earle before I even knew what was happening... second time was way better. 
---
I'm stealth rifles (commando second)... so I concentrate on adds. I'm not real worried about looting bosses so much. 
---
I had fun both times... I got the plushy so far. Those heads are badass! 
---
Maybe we'll see you again sometime! :)
---
if youre going to afk you should be on a drum or a spit.. this way youre still helping as you leech
---
Oh yeah of course, I‚Äôm not saying they shouldn‚Äôt be fixed, but I doubt they‚Äôll be fixed anytime soon
---
I have a furious 33 vats minigun 2 star lvl 45 whats the value on it its magic rite i also have a raider arm with limb what makes these magic idk but whats the value On the items im on xbox both max lvl
---
And theyll make sure it's even harder to finish every season afterwards, to avoid handing out extra rewards again
---
I'd like it if they had a black smokey trail when you move or swing them.
---
I posted these recently:
---
 **Executioner's Explosive 50 LMG** 
---
and 
---
**PC JFFR1A Gatling Plasma** 
---
Junk?
---
Cranberry Bog, make a concrete foundation.
---
I‚Äôm only nice because you can‚Äôt be mean
---
Lol yep, that's 76 for ya
---
The event allows for a bunch of different contributions like donating prime meat, putting the meat items from small animals into a container, harvesting and putting the plant thing into a container, playing instruments, and turning the cooking spits. The more of that going on, the better and quicker chance you have to complete it. If you afk on the drums or spit, you‚Äôre still contributing.
---
Value as in trade or sell? Only people who are aware of magic items will give you something good for it
---
&gt;It‚Äôs got to be on you while in the crafting menu.
---
Not really. I keep mods in my stash, always, and can apply them.
---
It takes very little damage to cripple one of its four engines which slows it considerably. And it gets slower for each one killed. The four engines have far less combined health than the main body.
---
I've always thought that an easy fix would be to change the bloodied effect to trigger based on *available* hitpoints. That is, if you're running around with 90% rads to cap your health at 10%, then only that 10% factors into the equation, meaning you'd need to hit 1% of total to trigger the 10% bonus. 
---
You can still roll god-tier damage, but you don't get to run around misusing a "poison" mechanic to keep it triggered at all times, which is the main problem with it.
---
But you get a lot of screws, new camp items and 8 treasury notes. I prefer the colossal problem
---
Agreed. Agreed. Agreed. :)
---
Imo the lmg is.  The gat plasma is mid tier
---
There is a weird irony in the fact that Radscorpions in the original Fallout games *were* a rather weak, entry-level enemy, and then they became considerably more badass in the Bethesda games.
---
I have fo 1st, i‚Äôm trying it right now. Hopefully it works
---
Try equipping the Armorer perk, three stars.
---
In fallout 76 if you left the vault while playing early access then you would not retroactively get the achievement when the game was fully released.
---
Amazing what people are complaining about...
---
U wanna build a camp down their too? To show us ur teddy bear colletion and staked foundations?
---
Get urself together man!
---
FYI: After the fight u can just loot the bodys no matter what the timer says. If the time is up u dont die or loose any loot or miss out the legendary reward. U just spawn in front of the mine to take pictures, talk and what not.
---
Kudos to you. you are the one in a handful that actually has good luck with that. in many ways not getting hurt by them is actually fairly easy now that i think about it. i went into a SBQ event once using the "All Rise" super sledge, i just stood on someones survival tent till the bitch landed, got right underneath her and hammered away, i was expecting to get obliterated but my health was not effected in any way.
---
Neither of those have came up yet, any specific way i have to initiate those?
---
I don't really use screws for anything, tbh.  Camp items look bad, imo.
---
There‚Äôs a really good big flat area on a cliff above site bravo. Best way to get to it is to fast travel to sunny top station and follow the road towards bravo.
---
Ok so my understanding could use some polishing then. WHERE might I acquire said polish?
---
Not really. It's true that she could have taken Brody in, but that didn't directly lead to their downfall. Brody was just an in with the raiders for Olivia when she wanted to leave the Order many years later. Brody doesn't even seem to harbor any direct ill-will for them on a personal level, so it's not like them not taking him in caused him to plot against them for several years. He is doing it in order to survive. Brody isn't even a great raider, as he's falling behind on his raiding quota and David, the leader of the Cutthroats, is gonna kill him if he doesn't succeed with Olivia.
---
Also, I can understand why Shannon wouldn't trust him, the impetus for starting the order comes from Olivia almost being taken and raped by a group of raiders they come across. If they had taken Brody in, maybe things would have turned out differently, but the real issues in the group stem from Shannon and Olivia's relationship. Olivia could have found some other way to betray them, or done the same thing with a different raider.
---
Yeah, I mean... Most of the stuff here *was* mentioned in the PTS forum, and we all see how that turned out.
---
Why would we suddenly become Raiders? Why did we stop wearing our vault suits and start dressing up as Roman Centurions?
---
If you ever need a private server just hit me up.  IGN jermany755
---
Did you read through the terminals in Abby‚Äôs bunker when you did the free states quests?
---
Don't do that. Hit the drums or something. You can AFK at Nuclear Winter, like the rest of us except those teams of four which play as if they were hunting Osama.
---
I think the fight is pretty cool, but besides running it when your low on screws or treasury notes.  It‚Äôs just a massive ammo dump.  And it will get boring quick. It is a pretty good xp farm tho if you be that guy and just kill wendigos
---
Actually, I'm not even there for the legendary or boss. My primary goal is the ridiculous amount of screws it gives you. I had 3 screws 24 hours ago, now I have over a thousand.
---
Wait till the damage nerf hits and sponge goes up 50%.
---
Unless the rewards get jacked up, which they won't, the resources needed to do the fight far out weigh the rewards.  
---
Will just be like sqb.  Melee standing around while heavy gunners drop 2k-3k ammo which will be more like 3k-5k post nerf.
---
/r/fallout76settlements
---
Faction wars is a great idea. People have been kicking the idea around since launch and I think integration with the public teams could be a great method. Join a BoS public team and members of a different groups public team become flagged for pvp.
---
Interesting. I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong or I‚Äôm 100% right. For me though, I‚Äôve always had to pull them out of my stash to get them to work.
---
Okay thank you, will check it out in a bit.
---
Gluck! I read on here about that work around.  Might take a couple of tries
---
I agree 100% Especially since Jetpacks are more costly to make
---
How do you ensure you rejoin the same server?
---
How many extra weeks of therapy do you attribute to this?
---
Hard to know with this game. I have had the need of equipping Armorer to be able to craft OR apply them, which is weird. Or not.
---
Ill be honest.. Buggy boss clipping through the floor and ceiling sucked. 3rd through 6th runs went much better because the team worked well together. All it takes is a Leroy Jenkins on your team to make any mission fail.. Lucky we did not have that issue and it was hella fun. I am considering doing a strictly windigo run too to get screws... I mean provide cover fire for the and crowd control.
---
Hard to resist a bloodied cursed 3 star axe.
---
I would say the boss room need work. Higher ceiling less clipping terrain. Boss auto loot would be great too. Or a instanced stash of some sort to loot after the raid. Like the box behind the door near the entrance you loot on the way out.. Just have it funnel there.
---
For some reason I have a really hard time hitting shit with the harpoon gun.  Is there something obvious that I'm missing?
---
How would I afk on the drums? It was my understanding the character has to be moving to not be auto signed out, not just the camera?
---
Wow these look awesome!
---
If ur on pc hit me up and ill give u 25 more as a present.
---
Happy birthday fellow fault dweller!
---
Which are you talking about?
---
"Magic" weapon with a fire rate of more than 200, most likely.
---
How would I afk on the drums? It was my understanding the character has to be moving to not be auto signed out, not just the camera? Copying and pasting for faster responses so I know how to contribute.
---
Nukacrypt, it has a tool to let you check relative prices of weapons.
---
Using a laser weapon with a blue laser, from what I can tell.
---
I missed whatever happens at the end because I died and spawned outside. No idea what a totally happens, despite being the person that nuked it.
---
At least give XP for challenges.  Or just remove them entirely.  What's the point of having these challenges appear after we have finished?  A tick saying complete and no reward is pointless.  
---
Having some reward will give us something else to do in the game.
---
A BoS style camp? I found a bit flat Land near the atlas observatory. easiest way is just fast travel to atlas look to the right and walk down the street until the first curve. Left is a blue car and a car frame at the ground. I have my camp also there and if you can handle the curve right you have some good flat Land next to your in futur dropping BoS
---
Im on xbox one also still dealing with challenges not resetting if im online during the rollover
---
Thanks for all the helpful answers. A tad dissapointed but also a tad happy i do have an old double bp rifle so thats cool to know it fires as fast as you pull the trigger. Sad to know my hopes of a double or quad bp pistol are just a dream.
---
Some heavy weapons, especially with high fire rates, are exhibiting what were calling ‚Äòmagic damage.‚Äô   They start by producing normal damage, but if you maintain hits on the same body part the damage will begin to increase exponentially.   It‚Äôs not a hack or a glitch...just an unintended game mechanic that some players are aware of and using to their advantage.
---
Unfamiliar with the term, whats a magic weapon?
---
Camera movement keeps you active. Have done it many times.
---
Drum AFK during Meat Week is very popular.
---
Makes sense id like a caps value i am currently going out and testing agensy furious 1 star mini i had almost scriped i anise will test the arm im not usually a believer tell i see it
---
There is a sort button. If you are on PS4 I believe it is R3, or maybe L3. It tells you at the bottom of the screen.
---
Edit: wow that was a lot of typos. Sorry
---
You can sort it by different things if you hit L3
---
I had to entirely remove all my weight reduction cards.
---
Dropped from 9 &gt; 3 strength, relied heavily on bando. But i figure i just take the ammo i need and stash the rest.
---
Ive been luck in rolling a ammo weight reduc ss unyielding chest(1 of the 3  ***unyielding chests to date horse shoe up my ass apparently)
---
I refined my daily kit and am trying to intentionally go without str perks as a handicap.
---
The real issue i have is being under 300 weight and keeping it that way without sacrificing your hard earned scrip or cuisine, im not big into food crafting so i usually just stick to purified water for heals if im low on stims.
---
I have 14 agi so i can get away with some thru hiker perks but trying to really widdle it al down to maybe a dozen pure water hot slotted and as many stims as you can carry 
---
The scrip is just a nasty uphill fight  cant really skirt around that too easily unless you hire couriers
---
Personally I have alt characters with diff builds to reflect diff needs ie bear arms scatter shot packing light ordinance xpress etc...
---
But those alts are playable in their own right.
---
You just have to trust a good courier if so... thats just me though.
---
I tried stashing all my gear i want to keep or sort out later in the stash and make sure i have a good set of excavator if i really absolutely get in a jam
---
I actually agree -- making a level boss a sponge is a lazy "solution."  I think they are just not sure how else to fix things, short of a major MAJOR nerf across the board.
---
I think they've made the great first step to reduce the fanout effects so they all work off the base stat, not a compounded result of stats.  But that's overall a minor thing.
---
I personally think they should limit the # effects that can be stacked on any one thing, regardless of the source -- to maybe 3-4.  So go ahead and load up tons of food or perk cards, only the first \~4 to hit will work.  Once they wear off, the others will kick in.
---
High strength means you could just grab a good axe or baseball bat and cause enough damage to get your share. 
---
If you are on PS4 I can give you an antiarmor Grognaks Axe.
---
The only people I understand in NW are my mic'd friends that team from the main menu.
---
Evil? No. An incredibly stupid and needlessly involved way to accomplish something? Definitely.
---
You might have hit the sort by accident
---
Sure
---
oh nice. I doubt i'll be near lvl 150 any time soon, lvl 20 currently.
---
Players seem nice at least the ones that i play with. It sucks the game has no chat though.
---
What i would really really really like was a companion system, it seems current "ally" system is not more than a "dress up dolls with some quests".
---
playing for a 4-5 days and it didn't bore me so that's a plus.
---
also i don't get the game's level system. I go to an area to do a quest, there are 15 lvls, 25 lvls, 32 lvls all bunched up together.
---
It's been happening the ENTIRE time
---
Then... don't?  If you are one who tries to take down the end-boss on a public server in as fast a time as possible, then please just go to a private server.
---
Nothing is more annoying than fast-traveling to the start of an SBQ event, only to find out some twink took it down before anybody could arrive.
---
In kindergarten, they teach people how to play nicely with others and share things.  This is a life-skill that people should realize still applies even in online games and public events.
---
Will deff check it out
---
Will check it out
---
How many times are they going to f this up.
---
In kindergarten, they teach people how to play nicely with others and share things. This is a life-skill that people should realize still applies even in online games and public events.
---
If somebody WANTS to do this, then just go do it on a private server where it doesn't affect anybody else.  Otherwise, realize you are part of a community, and doing so is basically a rude move.
---
And now I know where I got the flag from. LOL.
---
I absolutely agree.  I would instantly spend whatever amount in Atoms to be able to buy the Patriotic power armor skins that look like Air Force Thunderbirds.  I've got a connection to the team and being able to rock paint like the jets would be too fucking cool.  
---
But...it appears it was a one-off and I have to hope it cycles back through at some point.
---
I was so frustrated with the scrip limit/module grind that I just couldn't bring myself to even turn on the game for weeks. Then a got a wild hair, booted it up. I reached the point on the game board where I unlocked some additional scrip, so I got my 200 or so together with the 100 extra and crafted some gauss minis. On my 2nd try, BOOM, B FFR, the exact one I've been wanting.
---
I did sooooo many shotguns before I got a good one, soooooo many minis. Now that it's over I feel a tremendous sense of relief, like I've been set free again to play the game in a way that makes me happy instead of feeling like I had to do chores BUT ONLY a few chores per day, then I couldn't make anymore progress. 
---
I had a secondary character I was going to grind SS armor with but there's no way, no goddamn way, I'm going to do that now LOL. I already have good armor. I'm just going to play events and hit SCORE occasionally and not feel like I've got to log in every day or even every week.
---
Cannibal perk?
---
Shadowed Ultralight. But shadowed is not that relevant if AGI is high enough. A bloodied Unyielding character will sneak whatever the mods.
---
My ninja was shadowed combat but I switched to BoS and he is as hard to find as always.
---
Despite the bugs I had tons of fun with it last night.
---
Ward needed to sleep.
---
Some info here: https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
and here: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=angry+turtle+magic+weapons
---
Sounds like a bloodied gauss minigun. I use one and it melts the SBQ and the WC in nuked zones. I'm not sure if the stats are different for the regular Colossus and Earl though.
---
Ugh. Omg this! Yes.
---
I'd bother trying to explain the weird level system that has to do with different areas and all of that..but it doesn't matter because they are fixing that weirdness in the next update. One Wasteland.
---
As for allys... I get you but also, but I personally prefer them not to stick with me. Personal preference
---
Yet‚Ñ¢
---
Played it a few times gotten okay rewards but once I played with a team full of hard hitting players it was awesome. A tank led the colossus into the corner and we all started melting it
---
I have 3 of those wooden houses there, a glass dome, a red rocket garage a shebby shed and a selfmade house + garage. Should be enough space to place some bunkers haha
---
Hey it worked thank you!
---
I shall give a try, thank you for the response.
---
Well, I figured it out. 
---
It‚Äôs not the same as in daily ops. Literally every enemy in daily ops drops a stack of ammo.
---
Only about 1 in 4-5 Wendingos has ammo on them; I wasn‚Äôt trying to loot before, I made it a point to loot in my last run and yeah, definitely not every one carrying ammo. But it did seem to be contextual; good amount of shotgun ammo when I was using a shotgun.
---

---
STOP RESISTING! the delicious taste of Slocum Joe‚Äôs
---
They should throw it in the garbage and put that functionality into those 'Ammo Machines' that are sitting unused at all of the train stations. Turn those things into Ammo Convertors with a legitimate interface menu which is simple to use, instead of trying to sell .308 rounds for 4 caps each in those machines.
---
I mean the SBQ is another story. The last time, she was level 95 and the creature spawns were insane. Toe to toe with a regular Scorchbeast is another matter. Without Power Armor I'm still at over 400 damage resistance and the Enforcer effect on the shotgun staggers them a bit. I was pleased I nearly took down a legendary and a regular at the same time before my dumb server crashed. I just mostly ignore them until they land. I do need a long range alternative.
---
There were 5 of us in my instance, 2 over 250 and me just under 400.  And then 2 sub 20s.  It was a total crap show.  Had to repair my 2 main guns 2x, burned through 2k rounds of .45 and 3k of 556 plus a couple hundred rail spikes to boot.
---
I'm a Junkie Commando build and I felt like I was hardly scratching Earle or the spawns.  I had almost no time to try and recover ammo from any of the spawns.
---
I got a shovel and a suppressors gatling plasma 3\*.  I didn't get to loot the room at the end nor Earle.  Given the investment of time (I was the one who dropped the nuke) it's hard to want to do this in the future. 
---
You can't just join this like the SBQ fight and assume some decent chance of success.  Now I'd be ok with that if it was because it was a challenge.  But really it's just a giant bullet sponge.
---
Insurgent + assaultron helmet: mandalorian.
---
This is definitely a game changer. The race to the exit is intense but I felt bad about not looting all those wendigos. Thank you!
---
I mean, it IS a glitch. Just not one that‚Äôs very hard to exploit.
---
the Fallout 76 community is awesome. i help out as much as i can myself. i used to have a stockpile of ingredients for stimpaks, but i started handing out so much stims that i almost used all of it up, same with Radaway, lol.
---
my biggest gift i would say was level 1 hunting rifle i crafted for a friend. this guy is new to the Fallout universe in general. he was level 3 at the time. modded the the hell out of it and well since when do you find a level 1 gun with 73 dmg to it. plus gave him 2000 .308 rounds, he seemed VERY grateful.
---
IDK ive never compleated it because whenever I die o get spawn bugged THANKS BETHESDA VERY COOL
---
Definitely team up, but don't stop there. Lol
---
The good thing about running a strength based build IMO, is the fact that you have 3 weapon categories that can be switched out fairly easily, shotguns, heavy weapons, and the 3 mele catagories(1hand, 2hand, and unarmed.) Idk what your shotgun build looks like but you might want to look into either anti armor, junkies, or bloodied weapons if you want to do more damage to the queen. She has a ton of resistances and a base damage reduction. Shotgunner might be feasible against the queen, but it would probably require a lot of build tweaking and a very good weapon.
---
Out of curiosity, what platform to you play on and what is your build like?
---
Dammit, I laughed coffee through my nose!
---
They could include some dialogue based on whether you already completed the Order of Mysteries quests. Everyone will still be able to do that questline, so the structure of the rebuilding effort should take that into account. They could say something to effect of "I came back and noticed you had become a new Mistress in Cryptos, please help me rebuild." And I think technically you aren't the leader now as there are two ranks above Mistress. Perhaps through a new quest line or reputation system(preferably shorter than Foundation and Crater ones) you can become the Mistress of Novices(although I think it makes sense for the rebuilding person to take that position) or you become the Headmistress and appoint the rebuilder NPC as the MoN. Alternatively, part of the quest could be to find a new Headmistress to take over, since as the player you will be doing quests and taking on missions it doesn't make much sense to become the leader and still be doing all that, something I find annoying about a lot of Bethesda Faction stories, but YMMV. Plus all the players of the game would be the Headmistress, so that kind of messes with the world lore a little.
---
I'm on XBox, so I jot down the names of a few users I see on my server, then after I quit and swap characters, I look them up in the Social tab &gt; View Profile &gt; Join Game
---
Not to put a damper on your damper but a ton if shit makes it past pts still buggy. IF it even gets on pts.
---
I do have a private server. I don't play in public ones anymore. but even then, blame Bethesda for making this mess always online. a lot of player would be more than willing to play offline, or in local servers.
---
more to the point, some people want to be op and be able to one shot things. it's not necessarily a bad thing.
---
Any camp anywhere near a random spawn is going to be flattened without a ton of defenses.
---
The mini needs to have over 200 fire rate on it in order to work, I would sell it for not less than 5000 caps
---
Because the other one wasn‚Äôt condescending and yours was.
---
Why are you shocked that polite behavior is better received than rude behavior?
---
When is the last time you blew a bubble eating an orange slice gum drop?
---
It‚Äôs significantly more complicated than backpacks. 
---
Backpacks are their own thing.
---
Jet packs are simply a mod on power armor. 
---
They‚Äôd need to code up a whole separate subsection inside the torso misc mod section for jet pack appearance. We‚Äôve never seen a tiered mod menu like that before; might be super simple, might be way too complicated for the programmers currently handling ‚Äò76.
---
Not that I disagree with you, just saying, it‚Äôs not nearly as simple as backpacks,
---
Did it 3 times on private last night with 2, 4 person teams all together at the event a few did die to the drill it was pretty fun and honestly I don‚Äôt notice I‚Äôm wasting any more ammo than I do at the sbq between shooting her and her adds or earl and the wendigos plus I got a mountain of screws
---
Edit spelling
---
Makes you wonder if the grind for the BoS bunker in season 2 will be worth it.
---
Starts in 23 hours. It's just to the Southwest of Vault 76 if I'm not mistaken
---
Wait, how do we know that they have one?
---
If it is the one around lvl 83ish, then it is the icon.
---
Looking for it I realized i was wrong. Both are likely mining masks, but they are pretty different.

Yes, I absolutely agree we should call them rage grinders.
---
n is the base damage; a,b,c are the damage buffs for the weapon class(in %).
---
p = a + b + c
---
Live Damage Calculation = n(p)
---
Patch 22 Damage Calculation = n(p)
---
Example with n = 45; a,b,c = 20%
---
p = 20% + 20% + 20% = 1.6
---
Live: 45(1.6) = 72
---
Patch 22: 45(1.6) = 72
---
Hmh, these two values are the exact same, aren't they? YES, because this formula does NOT add things like bloody mess into the equation, which, on the live servers, buffs the **total** damage by 15%, rather than the base damage by 15%, as seen on the PTS. This is the new formula:
---
n is the base damage; a,b,c are the damage buffs for any weapon class(in %); z is the bloody mess buff(in %).
---
q = p + z
---
Live Damage Calculation = n(p) \* z
---
Patch 22 Damage Calculation = n(q)
---
Example with n = 45; a,b,c = 20%; z = 15%
---
z = 15% = 1.15
---
q = 1.6 + 1.15 = 1.75
---
Live:  45(1.6) \* 1.15 \~ 83
---
Patch 22: 45(q) \~ 79
---
Would you look at that! There are now two entirely different values! The same new formula applies to bloodied, chems, ect. It's there to make damage calculations easier.
---
Savvy. Cheers.

There is a bonus chest in the metal shelter right at the beginning. It opens up once Early is dead.

Legendary Run was exceedingly easy to finish with little play just completing the dailys and weeklys I maybe play 1 or 2 hours a day. Not everyone is supposed to get everything it's for the players committed to finishing and those who pay.

World containers will hold stuff until the cell resets. It won‚Äôt reset as long as players are still in it, but if you‚Äôre doing this in some out of the way corner of the world, yeah, i wouldn‚Äôt count on it lasting long.
---
Wrong sub.
---
I highly doubt I can do another season.
---
The first had felt too much like work, and the content rewards have been disappointing to me.
---
You can't AFK for too long. If you can't do it every 15 minutes, then, maybe you should wait for a better moment. The server kicks you out because it feels you are not playing but taking resources and affecting performance. Which is true.
---
It's not personal. When I am too busy, I AFK on a bed while I do dishes, make breakfast, dinner, etc.
---
Bash damage only works on high RoF weapons. The harpoon gun is not. You might try it as a shotgun though, maybe that‚Äôll make it magic (not that it‚Äôs worth it with its single-shot, but yeah)
---
Bingo.
---
I make rail spikes and convert them into points. All they take is steel to craft. 
---
As long as It only takes steel to craft those and convert them to points I like the ammo converter. 
---
Yes the UI is pretty bad but it‚Äôs useable.
---
Just regurgitating some bullshit that he/she thought was a catchy phrase. Now he feels smart.
---
My bet is Chrmist or Grocer mod on backpack.
---
Udder
---
Disabled vendors again.
---
One dude, with a flawed premise. Yeah, I don‚Äôt trust his assumption.
---
To sexy for normal eyes
---
Wtf?
---
Just make them scrap into resources... what‚Äôs so hard about this. They could even up the resource cost of things to balance out
---
Same here. Yesterday I panicked and fast travelled away missing out on rewards. I thought for sure it would be like Lode Bearing where you die/fail.
---
Thanx never knew there was a sort button.
---
thanx I had no idea that you could sort them.
---
I need to re-heat my Sweetwater Special Brew.
---
I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
---
I killed Earl yesterday 6 times. Two of those times it was under 20 seconds. I was using my Junkie's Explosive minigun.
---
I mean, you can do the math yourself. 
---
10 damage per shot vs 7.
---
7 fires at 1.25x the rate. 7x1.25 is how much?
---
8.75.
---
So you‚Äôve got a gun that‚Äôs using 25% more ammo to do less damage per second. Without the bonus AoE damage on Adds you get from explosive.  
---
Don‚Äôt they teach math in school anymore?
---
Thanx I never knew there was a sort button.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he was cheating, I see enough of it during scorched earth
---
Go go go!  It's fun! :D
---
They should've introduced Quantum Mini nukes or something along those lines to where you need at least 6 or 8 people nuke the entrance to break it open. Crafting the special ammo for the Fatman would add an interesting quest or two, give the Fatman a purpose in the game and provide a legitimate co-op play style.
---
Farm with as many Intelligence and xp boosts as possible. Also remember we unlocked both High Score Weekend and Extra Challenges Weekend so you can get a good bit extra then
---
Also wanted to add that PVP on PS4 is completely jacked. As soon as bullets start flying my frames drop to about 5 fps.
---
What's the curse part though?
---
If you manually run out you can get into a room that was previously locked with a loot chest in it.
---
Meat Week should still begin on Thursday, unless it somehow also became broken since last year.
---
Were you using vats and what kind of weapon was he using?
---
Yeah, I think that comes down to point of view.  To me, a glitch is something you go out of your way to do in order to bypass a game mechanic.  For example, glitches are used in camp building.  In the case of magic weapons, no prior knowledge or special application is needed.  The game gives you a weapon...you use the weapon...the weapon does massive damage.  As far as the player knows this is normal and intended.  For that reason, I don‚Äôt see it as a glitch.  But I certainly see why you would.  
---
And for the record, I‚Äôve been frustrated at many Queen fights that I launched, only to see her melted by someone that decided to steal the event.  Use of this mechanism by individuals lacking empathy is still, at this time, a mechanic of the game.  As such, I don‚Äôt see it as a glitch.  Sorry.
---
Because you kept interrupting him. I would stare at someone with hate filled eyes if that happened.
---
They go through this process every time they add a skin option to something that previously lacked one, and it's not difficult to add existing skins as options.
---
Add another mod slot for PA torsos that allows equipping jetpack skins separate from the actual primary mod slot that gives the appearance of a jetpack you have the ability to craft onto said torso, with ATX entitlements regarding jetpacks checked. That is all that would be required.
---
Oh yeah okay, hard to keep track what does what with so many bugs lol. I had shotguns of which people said they were magical but they were still horrible lol
---
I was using vats for headshots considering my frame rates drop to an unacceptable level to even move. He was using a gatling gun from what I could tell.
---
MEAT WEEK!  Last Meat Week my wife would be like "Turn up the volume" and she would be walking through the house singing "Meat week, meat week...week of meat!"
---
I played it last night, absolutely loved it and laughed every time my character ran off waving his hands in the air. Need to pack some more firepower though, my usual rifles didn't do a lot of damage!
---
What does this even mean?
---
I named my second character (luck/charisma build) Clutch Nixon.
---
Bit of almost fallout-related trivia, in June of 1976, Clutch Nixon performed a stunt on Mars called ‚Äòthe red rocket‚Äô.
---
The initial reason it was pushed back was due to colossal problem starting on Tuesday, I expect colossal problem to start on Thursday ( If consoles are lucky) meaning meet week would be pushed back again.
---
Also Google fed76. It's a site us PC players use as a guide for trading prices
---
Well sorry I don't feel like hearing about the portable power pack or turret module or whatever he changes it to each time you talk. 
---
Really does make me think he does this to just have you go kill someone.
---
Some harpoon guns with explosive and the flechettes mod seems to do magic damage. Like my JE Harpoon Gun in vats.
---
Exactly. I don‚Äôt understand why this wasn‚Äôt how it worked in the first place
---
I dunno if it comes to the case but once I saw one of my teammates not respawning and I had the stupid idea out of my mind of shooting the corpse with an explosive weapon and as soon as it went flying a meter, my teammate was able to respawn and made me a thumbs up emote.
---
Edit: It was on the SBQ event where you lay dead on the floor in the event unable to respawn not the Colossus one where you spawn alive but unable to continue the event because it says respawn anyways.
---
Rad-away is an interesting topic, I'd agree there. But in FO76, I dont think anyone is using a fatman
---
Once a raider always a raider. ;)
---
I‚Äôll give you a hand if you want.    PSN is boredomshaman
---
All in good fun I suppose.
---
He'll eventually give you the quest if you wait him out
---
Staring contest.
---
Which power plant, and what‚Äôs preventing you from entering?
---
Right, a true Legendary card would be difficult to obtain, requiring some long quest chain, much time investment, and perhaps some failed attempts. These Legendary cards are just nice cards with a shiny marketing term slapped onto them.
---
At level 311, I ended up scrapping enough cards, both existing, from unopened perk packs, and spending some of my saved leveling points, to unlock all rank 2 and one rank 3. That's a total of 750 coins, or 375 cards.
---
If I had one coin per level and one coin per card, I would have been at 686, which is worse for me, so I will take a pass on the idea. I am fine with it the way it is.
---
First time is always the most painful.  You are fighting robots the whole time so with that being said here are my thoughts:
---
When you first enter use the terminal to remove the restrictions on the turrets and let them do the dirty work. Saves ammo for later. I found 2 spots this helps in. 2nd spot you will enter a room through a decontamination arch.  Use the terminal again to help clear out the bots.  At a point you will be required to destroy the main frame. Using explosive ammo ‚Äúmy 10mm pistol‚Äù destroys multiple cards at once. Saves a little time. After you launch pick up the purveyors holo just outside the elevator when you leave. And haul but back to where you dropped the nuke Incase someone has a magic gun and kills the SBQ before you get there. I used a Gatling plasma during my run and got through the bots easily
---
No, that‚Äôs just a visual glitch from when the player left the server.  It doesn‚Äôt always disappear when they log back on. 
---
It‚Äôs a little bit early for synths. ;)
---
*Edit: Well, that was unexpected.* ü§î
---
Most players are not optimal builds designed to do this why make things worse for the average player if your so bored one shoting things DON'T play a different build I see groups of people not able to kill her at all way more than I see groups kill her in under a minute.
---
Hmm I have a BE one somewhere, forgot the third perk, if it even has one... but the odd delay to shoot after reloading makes me dislike them. They are hella strong though.
---
Same here. I‚Äôll be done in a few days but the grind is ridiculous and having previewed next season, I won‚Äôt be doing it again.
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy the game anymore. I just login, hit my scrips, caps, gold, dailies, and I‚Äôm out. From now on I‚Äôm limiting my play to special events like Fasnacht and Meat Week.
---
I just assumed it wasn't, I only follow the game here, had no idea about a PTS forum so I hadn't seen it here and just assumed it wasn't, thank you
---
This never happened to me. Must be the kind of wall it‚Äôs using. See if it works if you jump at it while facing it.  That usually does the trick when you can‚Äôt select a certain item
---
If all else fails just blueprint your cabin with the stuff inside and store it if it bothers you.
---
I have already given up on the event and I haven't even played it.  Endless delays.  Sounds like the event on PTS  is a disaster on the scale of  a nuclear meltdown.   When it finally goes live it will be on the scale of a massive train wreck and Bethesda will call it progress. Yeah. No thanks.
---
Posidoen and it's always on the side with the north cooling tower. It's fine if I go in the front door w/ level three hacking, just discovered so not game breaking anymore just annoying.
---
Depends on how many shots I can get in though. The faster fire rate is easy to pop off rounds in a couple second bursts where if the WC is moving around alot, the damage from the slow firing weapon misses out on damage. Its not as simple as just doing math. We're  not shooting at static targets 5 feet away
---
1. They probably just wanted to emote to be goofy and confuse you because it‚Äôs funny - the tag line for that one is ‚Äúit‚Äôs a funky mystery‚Äù
---
2. As far as I can tell, that one is either a Christmas themed emote that doesn‚Äôt seem to have a strong meaning, or its ‚Äútaking a picture‚Äù. I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I know that I‚Äôve accidentally used that emote before. 
---
3. I typically do this in adventure as an excited ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the same in nw
---
4. My best guess for this one is that your teammate either isn‚Äôt ready to move yet, or thinks you‚Äôll give them away
---
5. No idea, sorry bud üòÖ
---
Not impossible in theory, although only A Colossal Problem was announced to be delayed on consoles. That suggests Meat Week is still planned to begin tomorrow, unless there are unexpected problems.
---
Same...two to go
---
Thursday...   as far as I know, it has always been scheduled to start on a Thursday.  
---
So far, They have never started any new content on a Wednesday.  Sometimes things are enabled right after patch Tuesday, but very rarely.
---
That's some sweet ghost people looking helmet
---
Store the wall that its placed on, it will remove it and place it in your stored items.
---
He probably entered god mode using a exploit
---
This has been posted here many times. Maybe the vault experiment is how many times people don't use the search function.
---
I didn't know such existed. Wish I would've screen recorded to report it.
---
How about faction public teams with all the abilities and buffs you spoke of. Then have certain areas on the map that are contested similar to a workshop. Then pvp only works when you enter those zones.
---
Earl doesn't like if you shoot up into those dangling balls and petes legs.
---
Frustration understood and shared.
---
I tried moving my Camp multiple times in quick succession. It removed the machine, but the budget is still stored and there's no way to remove it other than placing the machine again, at which point you're stuck with one again... üò≠
---
Vats has been bug as hell in pvp. Friend and I like to test our builds on each other and his vats shots don‚Äôt register even though he hit markers me. From what I‚Äôve seen all ranged vats is this way and melee to an extent.
---
Never heard of that bug before. So what exactly happens? You get the card, erase the data on it, use the auto doc, go back to the terminal and select fabricate ID? What happens then?
---
Secret Service jetpacks could use some skins as well. Make the backpack invisible and have a better looking jetpack or something idk
---
I was told I could afk on the drums by spinning the camera, however if that doesn't work, I will have to resort to spinning around somewhere like I had to do for fasnacht. I know for sure that works.
---
Anybody have the same issue?
---
Trade in the empties like butane cans
---
It's a nice idea, I however prefer the idea of another user, namely that the world map is divided into individual sections for each faction.
---
read their computers
---
Just did it for the first time and ran out missing out on lots of screws. Won‚Äôt bother next time, thanks!
---
Got a nice 3 star quad Tesla with limb damage for my trouble. Not a bad event.
---
It's a known bug where they autocomplete. No way of getting the points back unfortunately.
---
If they have a charge ,tough tiddy
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
Yesterday it comleted half of Daily and weekly for me :/
---
So Commando players with excellent hip fire are the only ones who are going to survive in PVP?
---
Meh, reporting usually does nothing (unless Beth loose money). You should see NW on PC üòÇ
---
This. Youre gonna have a lot less players interested in the content if your solution to an overall issue is nerf everything instead of balance it out. Its a really poor attempt to balance things out. 
---
Ammo also has weight and is going to become more of a necessity. You might still have a hand full of people doing it in big parties but there's no way you're gonna have a lot of people doing it. 
---
There's gonna be a huge cost/benefit gap that anyone can see is not worth doing.
---
Same here. I came back in for the BoS event, and was really enjoying it again. But honestly. The changes Bethesda is making,  and the changes I see people on reddit advocating for very quickly drained my motivation to keep playing. I find myself here far more than I find myself in game.
---
It does not require the last 3500. 99 to 100 is 3475, and once you hit 100 it just says max. I finished yesterday; all of you on the grind, you‚Äôll get there!
---
i love it when they fuck up atom items i like, they end up being free.
---
I've said this as well as others when it was obtainable for the first time. 
---
I feel though they won't because their might be a bug and they won't be able to fix it. 
---
Which is a stupid excuse. It shouldn't be this time consuming to convert unwanted ammo!
---
Awesome thanks!
---
It only happens when using it on a T-65 helmet however. Every other helmet it works just fine.
---
My first time doing it, I saw 7 participants on the event, so I eagerly joined.
---
Except I was all alone. I explored the cavern, thinking more would join me. But the timer ran out, and it was me vs Earl. Maybe the event is variable difficulty based on players? Whatever the case, I finished the event solo with 1 death. Used up a lot of stims and chems. I just mowed everything down in my PA/Ultracite Gatling Prime. 
---
It was the first real challenge I've had in this game (I'm level 125 or so.) Doing the event in a group is still fun, but just not difficult. I hope the One Wasteland updates bring some challenge to the game overall.
---
This has literally been a known issue since the legendary run has started. It has yet to be fully fixed unfortunately. It is recommended that you log off 45 minutes before 9am pst and log in 45 minutes after.
---
No offense, but with as widespread as this has been, I kinda think you're trolling here
---
It's not one person I've seen this stated from but hey. You do you
---
I noticed this a lot more after patch 21. I don‚Äôt actively engage in pvp but if i see someone wanted on the map. And i think i can actually take them i might attempt it. Only to complete the challenge to get atoms. But iv had this happen with every one i try to fight.  So something is definitely going on since the last patch.
---
Last resort PA glitch through the wall...
---
What's the camera trick?
---
You can also kill him just as quick with a bloodied fixer build.
---
Use the walk through walls glitch, I don't approve of most glitches but when that happened to me several times including the whole process to get the tnt dome key 7 also screwing me, I feel it's fair.
---
Phew, that makes me feel better because I like to run around with low level players, let them take on as much as they can handle for the xp but I intervene if they seem overwhelmed. Seeing the changes made me feel I wouldn't be able to do this anymore because the lower lvl would end up being in way over their head. 
---
I can continue my mentor ways üëç
---
It's the log cabin. I tried all angles, usually can get it on other items.
---
Maybe it's stuck there unless I store it all.
---
Has the event been released? Or is this based on a beta server experience.
---
It's far worse than this sub reflects. This sub is a giant fucking hug-box.
---
One good thing about it is that it's an opportunity to get those 20 player revivals for the challenge. They were dropping like flies. And there's always one that dies on the way down. Don't be that guy (I was that guy).
---
What exactly happens? Run it daily and never had an issue with the card. Find card-scan myself in medical area-go to card fabricator-swipe card-use computer. Done.
---
You can also get in through the part of the plant they filled with raiders, across the parking lot, it‚Äôs just a pain to navigate to the main plant from in there
---
whatever the case, even the current idea is way too low for what the cards even do. You could add into my idea as one or level and two per card even. 
---
Overall there's just so many problems with the way you get coins, and the worth of these cards, they're simply not all worth the same
---
I never saw the information at the source, I saw a video that came up in my YouTube recommended. They seem to have not explained it so well.
---
For the people in the back, this means do not be logged in during the reset at noon eastern.
---
Account is only 39 days old and doesn‚Äôt post a lot. It can easily be missed unless you spend a lot of time on this sub.
---
Wait... they do??? That‚Äôs amazing
---
Melee can do pretty good rn too as long you‚Äôre smart enough to close the gap, but yah. You‚Äôre best bet is stealth or high fire rate. Especially since there‚Äôs a 110 dmg cap on pvp
---
Where is this loot chest at exactly? I heard it exists and have tried looking for it but haven‚Äôt been able to find it.
---
Never expect any good drops from the bosses and occasionally (as occasionally as maybe once a year) and you‚Äôll be happily surprised.
---
Live on PC.
---
Did you use the reader to wipe it?
---
This is why I turned pacifist on.
---
Thanks for saving me the Atoms - I was excited since the data mined info reached me 3 weeks ago (yes under rock living - is a thing!)
---
I am sorry (for them &amp; us) that, they don't understand the term "Usability and ability to use" 
---
I vote with my wallet in everyday items and I will here too.  Thanks for helping me be an informed voter!
---
Ahhh makes sense since I didn't see anything on console.
---
U gonna have to check some YouTube‚Äôs, I can‚Äôt really explain it.
---
Yep. Initially I thought I just glanced wrong at my screen, but if you watch'em for a few seconds, one of them'll twitch, like the jaw'll move a bit, but not in a fashion that would indicate it's the wind or something.
---
Those muscles are still getting signals, somehow.
---
Me too
---
I‚Äôm guessing the UI is so painful in an effort to make it impossible to dupe.  Vendor style menus are extremely vulnerable to exploitation.  It‚Äôs unfortunate.
---
these prices are stupid. 1500 one star sickle? is it signed by sickleman or something wtf
---
Found that one will pursuing the other recommendation. Thanks!
---
I'm at 93.  I still have a couple of weekly challenges to do which should get me to 94 or 95.  I considered using atoms to advance but most of the dailies are so easy that I tend to get them out of the way within 15 minutes or so.  
---
The level up one can be difficult, but I've been playing on two new characters and it's easy to level them up.  For the next one, I may end up deleting one of them and start over.  
---
But, yeah, the rewards aren't worth it if you found yourself grinding for them, rather than just achieving them by playing the game.
---
I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt just give 150 atoms to buy a level. The ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt fix or change levels‚Äù is just a lazy excuse.
---
Blue "lasers" are gauss weapons. Probably a gauss minigun or gauss shotgun.
---
‚ÄúGraphics are awesome‚Äù might be a bit of an overstatement...
---
There is a god mode happening but it only works vs bullets. 
---
You have to go out of bounds on the map and keep running. Then you teleport back. You‚Äôll be immune to guns but still take dmg from melee.
---
It‚Äôs a hassle to do but it‚Äôs possible. I don‚Äôt see the purpose of doing this since farming to me would be the same speed.
---
No really lol when i see a level 6 with some specific gear i mostly know its a crook begging.
---
That or a ability to rob random encounter scavengers and merchants in the world.
---
I love my Bloodied MMG. A friend gave it to me when I was lvl 30, the weapon is a lvl 45. He gave me 2 bits of Unyielding armor too. I'm lvl 136 now &amp; still use that lvl 45 2* legendary MMG as my main weapon. It's so good. Took down a 1* legendary lvl 80 scorchbeast in about 10 hits. Yummy. Still can't seem to find a lvl 50 3* Unyielding left leg though üòî
---
LOOTING ISN'T CONTENT
---
Isn‚Äôt muscles moving (contracting) after death a thing in real life
---
Yes the brotherhood officer suit is so cool and absolutely my style but no one will ever see it since it's under armour :(
---
Is it live in the public server?
---
Sure, but why do so many people think that being insulting towards the developers is the way to express their frustration?
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the legendary fire resistance card.  Its difficult to fit fireproof into my current build, and the perk is essential.  Aside from that, it‚Äôs a pretty fun event.
---
God that would be great. Imagine being able to hold up merchants for raider rep. You hold them up and can opt to give them a cut via a radiant quest that starts.
---
Low key I expect Bethesda to release a "complete" version of this game with all atom shop content and dlc...way further down the line but who knows. 
---
But I agree, them not having all of the items available sucks bc we get stuck with stuff like the Secret Service items for 20 days üòµ
---
It takes like 30 min to get the challenges done get over it
---
Spongy mobs ? I run a full health stealth build with chinese armor and an aa2525 assault rifle and I can kill them in 6 bullets. What is your build ?
---
Which environment and population are going to be impacted to make this evil? The entire country is already poisoned by radiation and will continue to be for millenia, and nearly all animal life is horribly mutated. Its not like another nuke is going to make things any worse. And nothing lives around there except horrible mutated critters, super mutants, and ghouls, so no casualties.
---
If anything, I'd say the huge drop in the local wendigo population and their breeding ground from the resulting extermination by the player team and subsequent mine collapse would count as a net gain for Appalachia.
---
I wish we were on the same platform.  It seems that you always take the words right out of my mouth.
---
It‚Äôs fine for me unless a group (4 or more) of people are using a tse mini guns.
---
I use PS4 pro so that could be the difference.
---
What mod?
---
Not sure on the bush stuff, because I don't do that. The nuclear stuff could be they are looking for the case or codes. 
---
I use the lunchbox emote to say I have a case and the nuke team to ask for codes.
---
That only makes all the sense in the world.
---
Armor IMO is the hardest to find if your being picky. I still have one level 40 piece because I can't find a better replacement. I have traded a B2525 fixer for one piece and a BE15 Gatling Plasma for two. It's expensive to make the perfect set.
---
Same thing happened when I put a weapon rack on the cabin wall, it wont let me move it or put a weapon in it.
---
I really wish that Bethesda would step up on this one and would give us the ammo machine plans.  Set it as an epic reward for a major BOS quest that's really difficult to finish.  Limit it to 1x machine per CAMP and per workshop.  
---
But they would never do this because they are all about the grind instead of content and game play.
---
Those of use who use Ultacite ammo will still need to grind.  Same with those who use Railway spikes (the ammo machine doesn't make railway spikes).
---
In this case its buying items I can't use and will no longer use
---
Hell my wife is big into animal rescue and the first time she saw me kill a hoard of wolves I got yelled at.  Why do I have to explain to my wife it's only a game!
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game. Valid criticisms are always great but I think people do have a tendency to forget to enjoy the actual game sometimes myself included. I forget how much I actually enjoy plottering about and doing nothing because I get myself worked up about stuff. But once I get back in to it it is a relaxing game.
---
I just hop around like a loon while spanking Earle, they dont really bother me much at all then.
---
I feel like they stopped selling the secret service items before most people have even been able to get the armor.
---
Why would anybody buy paint for armor they don't have yet?
---
Now there is a grand idea!  
---
Fix the &lt;thing&gt; PRIOR to 
---
Selling the &lt;thing&gt;!
---
I needed another mule, but yeah, using a new player for the legendary run makes it a ton easier.
---
Wendigos are usually pretty squishy no?
---
already asking for a nerf
---
Not even a bullet sponge. I‚Äôve melted him in 30 seconds.
---
For the first time I had this bug.  ALL of my dailies are completed with no S.C.O.R.E.
---
Overkill isn't a good enough description for how dumb it is. We can find the weak spots of a vault door and blow it off with a bunch of C4 like it's nothing, but we can't just get a shovel and move some damn rocks, or some more explosives? Using a weapon that literally ended the world to move debris is like using a chainsaw to cut a thanksgiving turkey.
---
I did it for the first time on live today, with one other guy that was lvl 80.  He was alternating between a gauntlet and power fist, so I‚Äôm not sure how optimized his build was.  Either way, we took Earle down in about 10 minutes.  I play a   fully min/max lvl500 bloody rifleman.
---
I died four times, always to fire damage, so I‚Äôm definitely going to shuffle some points around to make room for Fireproof.  I might also try to bring a shotgun to cripple the heads and legs.  He‚Äôs much easier when he isn‚Äôt chasing you around.
---
I totally understand why they do this from a marketing perspective, but I wish they would at least bring back more items each week. I‚Äôve been playing the game since Wastelanders and I want the FS Survivalist bundle so badly to complete my character/camp. I only plan to play until the end of the year so hopefully I can get it before then.
---
Also east coast and my IGN is the same as reddit.
---
Idk man...that looks like a synth situation there...
---
They need to just give everyone rank 100.  I know they won't because they are banking on people spending atoms, but it's ridiculous.  I'll still reach it, even with all my dailies auto-completing, but just barely.
---
You don‚Äôt want to know and if you need to learn that you didn‚Äôt want to know google some combination of the YouTuber MxR, Skyrim, mod and well, whatever is going on in the OP.
---
I usually hand new players a fully modded silenced automatic 10mm.  It's my favorite gun for low level areas.
---
Ignoring microtransactions, the game is a huge step up from fallout 4 in a lot of ways. The dialogue is far more interesting, though there isn't much of it. The new perk system makes me less frustrated as I don't get half way through, like I did in 4, and get frustrated that I cannot respec my character. I enjoy a lot of the combat etc. Overall there's a lot of improvement and a lot of bad, but it's still a solid and fun experience.
---
I got this bug after I swapped a combat rifle receiver from .45 to .38. I was able to make the bug go away by finding the original rifle and changing its receiver back to .45. The bug would persist even without the particular rifle in my inventory.
---
if we talkin about bethesda, curse part is prob that bash damage
---
Get a decent tesla.easy to hip fire!
---
I feel you. I just got the Captain Cosmos PA and while I enjoy some of the rewards, I can't help but feel like it was missing a lot. Especially in the way of Captain Cosmos??? I do not think the effort of logging in daily since June was worth it. 
---
I wish it was just a fixed 2k points to level instead of the gradual increase by 25 points.
---
Never had it happen to me fortunately. Tomorrow is double score though so hopefully you can make the difference ohwait
---
I believe double score applies to  daily 
---
Not weekly.
---
Never as in don't want to or never as in can't? It was easier than I thought it would be. A Team of 7 of us were killing it in under 2 mins last night so I attempted a solo today and while staying in Sneak the whole time I was able to kill him in around 3 mins. I would have posted the video but I don't know what the rules on this sub are like for links
---
They said that was patched
---
Just like they added deep pocketed mods on the last major update, except they didn't.  Rule #1 Never believe anything Bethesda says.  Even when they are confident something has been done, some manner of incompetence makes sure it's a lie.
---
‚ÄòThose detonators could have made a new well.‚Äù Or something something something. I only half listen to him - mostly spam the skip button and hope he doesn‚Äôt get locked up.
---
True, that'll help with my lower level character, thanks!
---
I'm getting second-hand PTSD just thinking about a group of those bastards 1 shotting me from the ground.
---
You mean like all the bugs the PC players are reporting lol. I suspect console players won't get it until next tuesday.
---
I would clear some out, yes. You'll be getting a lot of scrip if you play the event heavily.
---
Nope.
---
Just dont use Vats and ur fine. Railway rifle is the only gun wich works besides melee.
---
God mode doesnt work anymore...
---
I kill players like you with my lvl 25 toon, a AA/BE Handmade and non legendary heavy combat armor.
---
Levels doesnt matter in Foodbuild 76. If ur a foodbuild u loose against every one with the right perks. 
---
Now dislike me :)
---
Yeah... after logging in, go directly to adv.mode dont access the atomic shop or the legendary run... if you need to access them do it ‚Äòin game‚Äô... never failed me...
---
It‚Äôs not?
---
People coming here to post about it almost have to deliberately ignore the feed to not see all the other posts about this issue.
---
You don‚Äôt have to spend all 1,000 of it. 
---
Spend about 200 on random stuff. Maybe you‚Äôll get something good, maybe you won‚Äôt. That way you can still earn more script after.
---
or, exactly what a troll would WANT us to think /s
---
I found a lvl 50 3* left arm in someone's vendor a few days ago (needed a left arm too) and it was 2500 caps. I begrudged paying that much but I bought it because it's too hard to get otherwise &amp; I figured that if I didn't get it, I may not get the chance again. It's not as good as the previous one, by way of DR,  but it's way more durable. Still hunting down a left leg... one day, one day I shall find that covetted piece of awesome that my left leg so desperately cries out for!
---
I'm level 65 and the level 30 crickets do more damage to me than the damn deathclaws. A swarm of crickets scares the hell out of me.
---
If Meat Week rewards you with Scrip and you plan doing it a bunch, sure. If it doesn't, no. Keep the 900-1000 Scrip hover cashing in and spending your daily Scrip amounts until the Sale.
---
And: Do. Not. Cash. In. Scrip. Rewards. From. Legendary. Run.
---
Bank all of those so you can spend a ton more during the Sale.
---
You can bypass the semantics by focusing on whether the effect is intended or not by the developers.
---
No, did it earlier to test, got stuck in PA once in the room, but toggling to 3rd person got me out in the end.
---
Well he does keep on saying he has on eye on you. So....
---
You're welcome
---
I never noticed that before, but you‚Äôre right.   I‚Äôve seen zero football items, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve even seen reference to the sport
---
If your talking about the purveyor sale coming soon for unlocking it with supplies it isn‚Äôt until sept 10-14 according to the website.  So I definitely wouldn‚Äôt keep 1000 scrip until then.
---
you were about 36 hours early.
---
My level 3 turrets are gonna anhilate those damn molerates /s
---
Seriously though turning the game in to tower defense camp edition actually sounds hilarious and I will absolutely play that. If they make raids or spawns more common I would get that BOS bunker and turn it in to fort knox.
---
Encountered this with a lvl 14 the other day?? He was somehow nearly impervious to my instigating deathclaw gauntlet and could kill my level 196 character with about four shots from his laser rifle
---
What armor type of armor are you looking for and what system ( this is the RNG of Reddit) maybe I can help.
---
Swipe the card at the terminal that unlocks the laser grid.   This happened to me last night.  You still have the quest up, but no waypoint or objectives, yeah?
---
Uh...don't die? All joking aside, I put a lot of time and effort into preparing for this event so that I don't die. So far I've fought and defeated Earl six times with 0 deaths. How? I'm doing the following:
---
* X01 Power Armor with the Medic Pump torso mod
---
* Bring 100+ stimpaks
---
* Run a full health build
---
* Alternate using Vampire's heavy weapons (minigun for me)
---
* Bring lots of ammo (I used ~30,000 rounds of 5mm spread out over 6 fights)
---
* Field Surgeon 2
---
* First Aid 3
---
* Blocker 3
---
* Fireproof 3
---
* (Obviously) try to avoid the environmental hazards
---
There were a few clutch moments I had to spam the stimpak key and at one point I looked down and was surrounded by 10-15 Wendigo Spawns.
---
Never seen anything about it yet, I‚Äôm fairly new. Now I know
---
Don't forget that this takes place in a universe where someone found a live nuclear bomb and thought it was a good idea to build a town around it.
---
This is disgusting and I love it
---
Damn, I was with a bunch of random people and we didn't even kill the damn thing.
---
This‚òùÔ∏è
---
We didn't even think about that part!  Your right, I've never noticed any ads or propaganda for it. The plot thickens!!! lol
---
No.  The bodies of the leaders of the Free States, other than Blackwell, were never found.  So they likely left Appalachia after Harpers Ferry fell.  As far as we know, they are still alive and gathering new followers.
---
It seems to be bugged on the prebuilt buildings. I placed mine on my cabin now it's stuck too. I have seen others complain about the seedy shed and another building as well.
---
I believe there was a football uniform in the atom store, with the old school padded leather helmet. I don't think there's any balls in game though.
---
Nevermind I see you tag says Xbox. Sorry I'm PS4. Good luck.
---
Grouping helps, if you CTD during the event it allows you to rejoin, its smart. Doesn't immediately mean all members are using hacked murder weapons...
---
&gt;900/260
---
I spend more time walking than anything else.
---
Yeah I tried but I was using my Power Armor not very geared alt. So I run out of AP super fast and don't have a jetpack yet.
---
Oh nice! I'll have to keep an eye for that next time around. thank you :P
---
When's the sale?
---
I'm seeking lvl 50 Unyielding 3* left leg. I would preferably like BoS combat armour but it's not the deal-breaker by any means. I'm on Xbox.
---
I must have missed the final chest last night...oops.
---
Just asking for the spawns in the event to have the knock back reduced. They literally seem to knock back every hit. 
---
Sorry master overlord I didn't know I had to check with you about what I can an can't post..
---
Yeah I dont use PA in the event, until I come out and jump in before radded to death, when people dont just clip the mine and hit it smack dead centre of the nuke...
---
That was probably China‚Äôs opening move in their campaign to erode American values and prosperity.   Might have even been one of the reasons for the Great War.   I‚Äôm just gonna go ahead and choose to believe that to be canon.
---
Can the thing be destroyed by bombs?
---
I so much more would‚Äôve liked a OoM vs MothCult story than again more BoS.
---
You would afk for the event. If you‚Äôre hoping to just afk for hours and come back, I suppose you could tie a rubber band and run circles, but you might have everyone leave to go to another event and be stuck in a dead server for hours. You‚Äôre probably going to have to check in at the top of the hour and gauge how we‚Äôll the event is going otherwise you could end up with no rewards at the end of it all.
---
Send bobs n vegen
---
As stated I was on my alt who's not geared. All the spawns are max lvl 70 and aren't that squishy in this event. I have NOT done it on my main who has a B/FFR fixer who I'm sure wouldnt have much issues. But to the common player of this game, these ones in this cave will be pretty tough.
---
6 round on each of 12 different wendigos while avoiding 6 different DoT damage zones while also whittling down earles massive heath pool.
---
6 rounds is sponge territory tbh.
---
You should spend some of it to make room for more. Never stay fully maxed with scrip or you could miss out on earned scrip.
---
Fellow west-coaster here. I hop on shortly after 5 pm, feel free to add me ign: alphawolf12 (cringe I know it's what I get for letting little brother choose the name)
---
Oh LOL. Well, poop, thank anyway. I have PS4 but I doubt I'll play it on there. I have 2 characters over lvl 130 on Xbox, too much time invested now to change platforms. Shame they don't do cross-platform.
---
the only place he could put it, in his ass
---
Thanks for all the help!
---
When you hit start does it still show the reputation bars?
---
That does make sense, nobody tells the graphic design team to update the model or its just too late, gotta release it now because we need the $$$'s. 
---
Don't worry we'll do a hotfix if enough ppl complain about the placing/floating issues, maybe in a few days ..
---
Delayed for consoles
---
Should have given him those detonators.
---
.damn my bad I skipped   a line or 2 of your post.kinda feel like I jumped the gun.i haven't tried this event I just hope it's a challenge.took me 4 times before I was able to beat imposter sheepsquatch
---
"You can never have enough gold"
---
"The fact you wont trade it implies that I can have enough"
---
If you use a camera to look for the body, it'll sometimes make it easier because the camera will display the name of things you look at through the viewfinder, making it possible to find bodies in tall grass or bushes.
---
justify all you want, but it's toxic and makes this sub more of a complainfest than a place to share positive experiences. other subs are better at that
---
The problem with those challenges are on steam (have no clue if it has been addressed yet). If your on PS4 or Xbox you should be rewarded just fine.
---
I‚Äôm also Glad to see that they changed the 7600 hour reward to 760 atoms rather then leave it at 20.
---
It felt like a big slap to the face to dedicated players that spent that much time playing when it was the former.
---
You send support tickets to the atom tab where you report missing atoms. They take that much more seriously. Some people were able to get their atoms back.
---
Forget that. I won't even start a second character that does anything except hold my stuff. I don't blame you. Sorry I couldn't help. Good luck.
---
I don't know why I thought it would be an awesome weapon with a strange draw back or something
---
Been doing it since the game released, ain't getting fixed.
---
Its easy to be generous in this game, I have to unload stuff because I basically have no more room. Lol. Still feels good tho.
---
Oohh. Awesome. So the ProSnap camera and not photomode then.
---
There was only 1 football in all of WV. That‚Äôs the ball I scored 4 TDS in a single game with and is now in my memorabilia case.
---
Level 261 with an instigating gauss shotgun and AA fixer here, playing since Day 1 of BETA. 
---
Never PVP'd before so I can't offer much help.
---
... Ok, if 6 rounds to kill something makes it a bullet sponge, what can I say.
---
It is a world boss, not a random 3 star legendary. For that matter, I can concede that rewards should be better for the tile and ressources invested. But difficulty is alright.
---
I like the surprise. It's like waiting on a new episode of a show you like.
---
Bloodied Commando? Good job either way.
---
Their fix was magic weapons. Thus the issue still exists.
---
pretty much what I was thinking. This was at least the fifth one I saw today.
---
Thanks a lot, I had no idea what underclocking was until now, or that you could even do something like that. I tried just lowering the texture settings first (I normally run it on medium but recently I've been running it on high) and it worked. Does underclocking lower FPS?
---
The shop seems really empty right now. I hadn't noticed until I was helping my daughter setup a new character and scrolling thru looking for cheap and free items.
---
don't let it happen again.
---
i will pay you 2 cents for your 2 cents, thanks.
---
Yup. Seasons are separate from the actual lore. It‚Äôs a side thing to keep players ‚Äúinvested‚Äù more than anything. I imagine seasons without themes would be a tad bit more boring.
---
heh, point!
---
I must smell lol :-)
---
Don't know offhand, but I believe a "Purveyor Super Sale" was one of the BoS supply rewards
---
How does it mean more money for them?
---
Im with you on this one.  While we are at it... lets get Vault jumpsuit variants we can wear as outfits.
---
Same here. I actually started a new character sometime after switching to Steam when I realized I couldn't get most of the achievements with my existing character.
---
IDK.  I didn‚Äôt pay attention to what doubled (or not) last 2x score weekend, so you may be right.
---
OTOH, I just made L81 - at 3000 score for the next level and no major weekend plans, I‚Äôll hedge the bet, just in case :)
---
It‚Äôs exactly 250
---
Yes, but usually not as much if you have decent videocard with frequencies in the GHz.
---
Yeah I made a new one too but haven't played it but I probably should for ez level up score
---
Same thing that happens with Lode baring
---
Those are broken for ages now, tickets either get canned &amp; unfitting replies or just run into the 14-day-timeout and get auto closed :/
---
That's another point u/valseek and u/ladydevann wanted to tell the devs...
---
I must have it!!! lol good stuff though :P
---
I'm with you! They went straight for the heart!
---
Is the event active on consoles?
---
Yup, Bloodied Commando. I know it's a cookie cutter build essentially but it's how I enjoy playing. Was hitting around 120 - 180 per shot according to damage numbers. Did it without dying but not without some sweaty palms moments
---
In all seriousness there was a uniform bundle in atom shop. I think that‚Äôs as close as you will get.
---
i don‚Äôt have notifications and have been dealing with classes my bad! i won‚Äôt be on til later so depending on if you‚Äôre on or not we could do it then or sometime tomorrow
---
I would, but the dastardly ft-bug keeps me from getting there in time to get into a full team.
---
So until that is fixed, I'll leave monongah alone because it's no use getting aggravated.
---
I don't get this. The vendor UI is infinitely better. You'd still be able to do that tedious idea, except in the vendor UI.
---
I'll be up to help too..
---
It seems BGS is only concerned on play hours. Farming76 is the new normal so don't play events, farm them it takes longer. The lowering of damage and buffing of enemies increases farming time.  It slows the need for new lore and content if we are busy finding screws. I feel they are really trying to get players to play longer.  Load screens do and lobbies do just that.
---
760 is still a slap in the face, you cant even buy one bundle with that
---
but I'll try the atom tab then  still should take four fucking tickets
---
I don't think they will ever attempt to improve the UI again.  The interns there gave it their college try, and were told to move on, just like with the broken atom store crap.  They seldom fix any of that, so they won't waste any more money on a free item.  It would have been all right how it is if they put the 'sell' option first since people are selling more than buying, and only showed options to sell/buy when you had enough rounds or points, instead of getting constant 'transaction failed' screens.  You can tell they assigned this to the interns.
---
That‚Äôs fine I just don‚Äôt like it.
---
Not to mention you still can‚Äôt go into the actual ammo converter if you are in power armour because it puts your camera like a foot to low to see the screen
---
I see this anytime I see a big damage amount on anything.
---
Because it forces people to buy atom with real money instead of just earning it in game if they really want something on the shop.
---
Same reason First is the only way to get the scrapbox still
---
Yeah, honestly that is just about the only way I can see raiding being implemented. You perhaps gain a timed hostility with Foundation and perhaps a temporary wanted ranking that allows people to come looking for you, but if you evade capture it wears off after like an hour of in game time.
---
It seriously devalues to the point of scrip literally anything, even if it would otherwise be a god roll. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like it.
---
Interesting. I haven‚Äôt done such thing but done some modding. I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôll go away if I change the mod back.
---
Because OP logic dictates that he deserves free atoms when the company doesn‚Äôt owe people free currency. To me you don‚Äôt need atoms to enjoy the game.
---
But I can understand that kind of mindset.
---
xbox does not work properly often either.   
---
I have soloed the queen numerous times on my private server and still have no credit for killing her.  
---
Credit where credit is due: BGS has definitely improved the awards, but some still seem to be bugged.
---
Still much better then what it was.
---
Third star to the left and straight on till morning!
---
This dude I was so hype to make a little bunker home for my ally.. even moved my camp to a whole new location so I could place the bunker. Then boom everything inside floats off the ground, pretty salty
---
Barely, I still say it should be 7600
---
I barely even have 8000 hours across all games I own right now. They expect me to play 76 for a year straight?
---
This game looks so good on pc.  My Launch date Xbox one doesn‚Äôt do it justice .
---
A simple search would get rid of the redundancy
---
I helped the Settlers up to the point that I had to choose, so in my timeline they just have it and never got to use it.
---
Why shank you. Always good to know there's like minded individuals out there
---
Last time I checked, most businesses require you to spend money to buy their products.
---
I did this.  The settlers have it, not sure if they'll ever use it.
---
You‚Äôll be surprised. There are some players reporting at the 6k hour mark awhile ago.
---
Yeah, the BoS is more iconic to the series, so I understand them wanting to show them more, but the OoM is more interesting and unique to 76.
---
Let me know. I'm curious.
---
So Im not using the Bethesda launcher can I still do this or nah?
---
To shreds you say.
---
Cause: no idea
---
Fix: do less damage
---
Too good of an idea for Grindthesda.
---
This, like most public events, are farming events.. the drops and XP are in the waves of enemies.. killing the boss is awesome but just part of the rewards.. I heard that if you don't bother with Earl you can get more ammo back than the run cost you even if you dropped the nuke, so silo run included. Make a ton of XP and get all those screws...  Mmmmmmm screws üòã
---
Shoot me a message on here if you ever need any help. I‚Äôm east coast US and online most evenings.
---
Mountain man version of the Rusty Trombone
---
Ya the SBQ didn‚Äôt work for me either. That‚Äôs really the only one I come across that‚Äôs broken so far.
---
That's a good spot. Though I often get "Can't place CAMP" because someone has dropped their FO1st Tent right across from ATLAS. It blocks a large area.
---
I don't know. They've implemented a few of my ideas before.
---
That‚Äôs literally what they said with like the first update they made to the game ‚Äòplayers accomplished everything too quickly.‚Äô
---
I feel like they pushed out most of their audience by trying to cater the non existent market around the percentage of players who rushed the endgame and the dupers.
---
Like I don‚Äôt even really think it‚Äôs worth it to play because I‚Äôm not willing to dedicate my life to What should be a casual RPG.
---
I'm not sure why everyone has it in their head that Enclace is pairing off against BoS, it makes little sense. The Enclave is nowhere near the sort from Raven Rock or the Oil Rig, the Brotherhood hardly even knows of their existence and vice versa.
---
Ok so its not just me.
---
&gt; instead of trying to sell .308 rounds for 4 caps each in those machines.
---
As someone who uses a hunting rifle religiously, fucking this.
---
Indeed
---
Finally a use for all those legendary 3* shovels i was hoarding!!!
---
I'm a east coast player, but my ign is Kurairyu1. Just in case you we both are online and can quest together.
---
The game isn't free
---
You've put up with our broken mess of a game and our inability to do anything right for 7600 hours, here's 4 bucks. Yeah, much better and totally not a slap in the face. A unique outfit, a camp item, anything would be better than $4 worth of atoms.
---
I don‚Äôt know anything about their refund policies when you‚Äôre not using their launcher.
---
Are we suppose to stay after the fight? I FT after the fight since it says leave the mine or whatever and was rewarded with well... nothing. So whats the proper way here? The boss fight is pretty fun tbh but a bit of a mess.
---
And if some things weren't locked behind a bundle. I want the junk fences, but nothing else in that bundle.
---
The most hours I have in one game isn't even at 2000. Those are people who play 24/7 or simply stay online to farm the hours
---
It's not realistic
---
You still get the event rewards? I thought I at least lost my junk the one time I didn't get out for Lode Bearing.
---
If I don't get rewards that is fine, I'm not really helping after all if I can't drum. Odds are I will get a couple events, I come to my house periodically throughout the day so I can check up on it and maybe do an event or 2 myself. I just wanted to know if it was possible to afk it.
---
at this point, the things they put in place to stop duping is more annoying than the actual dupers.
---
Come off the elevator and go right. You‚Äôll find a room with a terminal.
---
Oooh nice tip üëç
---
I posted this a few days ago,
---
I think the current interface for vendors and such like for caps/scrip/bullion would work just fine.  Just do it the exact same way you trade in legendary items for scrip or treasury notes for bullion.  The terminal would have "Buy" and "Sell" selects, go to the terminal, select "Sell", the vendor interface will pop up and you chuck all your unwanted ammo in just like you would with legendary items or treasury notes, you get your points, back out of it, select "Buy", the vendor interface will pop up and it will list all the types of ammo in the same way the Purveyor does with the different legendary options or like any vendor for that matter, you select 5.56mm, you pick amount, click "Ok/Confirm" and big bada boom you're done.
---
The above is just a lengthy way of saying make the Ammo Exchanger a vendor and the Terminal acts as a dual select NPC for a "Buy vendor" or a "Sell vendor" exactly like the Scrip machines and the Purveyor.  The reason for the dual types instead of one is so you can keep track of what you sold like with the scrip machines, although I think there maybe a coding issue because of how the Devs chose to do the whole scrip and bullion system.
---
cuz u only want people who are dedicated to get the big rewards... not casuals.
---
Beth doesn‚Äôt owe you anything mate. These free atoms are just something extra. 
---
You payed for this game *once* and you can get a couple hundred hours of enjoyment from it before you put it aside. No game is meant to be played forever. That‚Äôs why I hate live service.
---
huh?
---
And they say there is no consequences of dying.
---
Bethesda listen to you.
---
Technically a herd!
---
We‚Äôre talking the 50cal here. It shoots 9 rounds a second. This isn‚Äôt a 44 revolver situation.
---
I joined a ghoul horde event in bog and once I got to it saw about 8 22 level ghouls and event was done. Don‚Äôt know what happened
---
The game is still full price in most places, and on top of that it's got a subscription service. The atom shop was fine when we could grind atom, they said themselves that it gave them plenty of money
---
On the 8th mean before maintenance that day, right?
---
I just ran this and to start with, someone nuked my camp while starting the event, as I was in the launch room to try and start the event so already off to a bad start, I get into the event we have 4 level 100-120, one level 40 and one level 64, not only did we not have a full team for this I didn't see the lower levels fire one shot at the boss, I ran out of ammo for both my guns after having used a shit ton of materials to make all the ammo, so I cam out of the even with nothing apart from one level up and now I have to repair all my camp and restock on all my ammo. Safe to say I'm just not playing the game again until the event is out of it, it's way unbalanced. Everyone's experience seems to either be it was really easy, or damn near impossible. The wendigo spawns stagger you too much to be able to even loot the wendigo spawns you killed to try and get some ammo back. This has easily been one of my most hated experiences I've had with the game ever.
---
I made the switch from a bloodied to junkies pa heavy gunn like 200 levels ago. I do not miss it at all. I run vamps way more often than junkies (only pull j out for big fights). As a heavy user I just use pa
---
Yes if the mine collapses on you you just respawn outside and still get the end rewards.  You miss out on chest but from my experience the chest just has had some ammo and various metal ores.  Imo your better off looting the bodies for screws
---
üòÇ
---
Nope, progression is character specific.
---
The only thing that is account wide are the number of slots you can have.
---
3

https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations
---
I Believe two. Neighborly and another one.
---
Crazy that levels mean absolutely nothing in this game.
---
Indeed. The changes actually will give you new opportunities to mentor. 
---
Take that low level buddy to barrows? Sure. West trek? Sure. Take them on a tour of the map to show them all they have to look forward to and get them some easy fast travel points? Sure
---
It adds up
---
I run a tanky PA heavy/demo build, and I know pretty much nothing about so-called magic weapons, my equipment is far from optimized in terms of DPS, and I‚Äôm still trying to find my ideal armor prefix, since vanguard is nowhere near as effective as I thought it would be with a full set, but AAFFR is pretty great for heavy guns (my primary is AAFFR .50 and I switch to a primed vampire .50 when I get down to about half health), and I swapped out one gun army for bloody mess (3), and it made a much bigger difference than I was expecting.  Feels like the 15% from that does more than 15% from any of the gunner perks.
---
Nice dream tho
---
It's 3. Friendly, neighborly, ally.
---
I did not. I'll have to start all over again from scratch. üòë
---
Yeah but if you want to play it I'd say get a team ready beforehand, if you end up with low level players it can be a nightmare
---
It is right before you get the exit.  It will be to the right.  It's a maroon trunk.  You will see a med box there next too it
---
Nice piggyback post.
---
I‚Äôve had thoughts about commando aswell but I just don‚Äôt know yet I will try my bloodied stealth rifle build first and if I won‚Äôt like it... well I guess it‚Äôs time for some more grinding. If I go for an automatic my 5.56 will burn so fast.
---
You know it's worth around 5k before dupe. And 500 after. Look in trade subs
---
And I meant it and I stand by it.
---
Glitch gun. Legal glitch gun, but a glitch none the less.
---
They were saving you from getting ripped off.
---
Were you using them in VATS? Magic shotguns are only magic in VATS, and they definitely are magic then. I run around in my ‚Äúcarry everything‚Äù perk loadout (no combat perks) and still oneshot any normal enemy with my Junkie‚Äôs shotgun (one type of magic for shotguns). But only in VATS. Free-aim and it could be 3-10 shots to kill them.
---
Could be people who are retired or don‚Äôt have jobs and or genuinely enjoy the game(to each their own). There are any number of reasons.
---
There are people out there who do play much worse games for longer then that. Just because in your experience that it would be improbable to clock in such hours doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not.
---
Died or blacked out ?
---
Bro, I brought this chick home last night, and she gave me an Appalachian Thunder Pipe.
---
If he somehow survived, I wonder if Scribe McNamara is an ancestor of Elder McNamara in FO:NV?
---
Half the game is playing it. The other half is crying about how you cannot play it more because you get frustrated from playing it so much.
---
then the reason they changed it wasn't about money.
---
The main problem with the "nerf" and new boss event is what you mentioned in your first paragraph. When we are accustomed to something, in this case our bloodied/junkie builds that put out massive damage, for almost 2 years and then all of a sudden they make a change like this, of course we are upset. They're was never an inkling that a change like this was coming (correct me if I'm wrong) and a lot of us have traded, grinded, etc for armor and weapons with specific effects to put out this type of damage. Bethesda is to blame because they have basically conditioned us to this and even they are aware that bloodided/high damage is king as seen in their ACP quakecon stream.
---
Bottom line is, this nerf came out of nowhere and is a slap in the face to all of us that put in almost 2 years of time perfecting our builds and equipment. But all of this is assuming  otbing changes once patch 22 comes out. They may or may not revert it back come showtime.
---
Don‚Äôt you learn that by scrapping miniguns?
---
I know. 
---
Source: literally me, Beefy Trout
---
Just need High Rad fluids. Never have enough of those.
---
Is there anything you get for doing the optional part?
---
Ahh yes, one of Aristotles finest quotes. Scholars of philosophy maintain their position that the origins of why he said it remain unknown. Likely was lost with the Library of Alexandria.
---
No, they don't owe us anything. Nothing at all. Not like they owe us a game that fucking works as advertised, or atoms for all the autocompleted challenges, but keep telling yourself that.
---
Sept 10-14 according to the website.
---
they started the Seasons / Legendary Run, because people weren't playing beyond, "do dailies, get atoms free" - so now "do dailies, get non-currency, and here's a small smattering of atoms, that you could have earned in a week of old play, but over the course of 3 months" they need daily player numbers to report to the shareholders, and want us to spend money on atoms. they won't give us more atoms for nothin anymore
---
Heart emote is accepted as thank you.
---
I just wish people would include the town of Monogah in the blast radius so I can farm up some hardened/glowing mass and irradiated fluid too
---
If it walks like a human and talks like a human then it must be a synth
---
Useless. Yeah. At a certain point why even have a stash anymore? They might as well just remove it from the game.
---
PSA: Make it your choice.
---
Then don't die.
---
Players aren't homogeneous.
---
Most likely yes, you will.  I had a shielded fatigues and was pissed when they screwed this up.  At least they are fixing it, apparently.  Where did they acknowledge that they broke the fatigues and were fixing them?  All I heard from them was another "we're looking into it" comment from one of them when this was reported.
---
Pretty sure you keep your junk if you die at any event
---
Ya know, can‚Äôt argue with that one my guy.
---
It‚Äôs a suggestion so the bug doesn‚Äôt happen lol
---
Sorry for your downvotes! Take care of my stuff and yourself, bud. Keep fighting the good fight.
---
Jeez these people. I‚Äôve been in the Atari age and you‚Äôll be surprised how much more broken those games are and they were expensive per game at that time.
---
This game plays. Yes there‚Äôs a bug here and here but majority of your play time is fine.
---
Not sure what barrel he's talking about but the tri barrel is only learned threw a plan
---
All that adds up is your ammo usage. It doesn‚Äôt change the math on damage. 
---
2sec burst:
---
10 damage x 9 rds x 2 seconds = 180 damage
---
7 damage x 11.25 rds x 2 seconds = 157.5 damage
---
That's me at my very lightest in the midst of switching out guns. I usually carry 3-5 automatic rifles and at least one or two heavy guns.
---
When in stealth commando mode I switch all my strength perks over to weight reduction. I also have maxed out batteries included and a grocers or chemist backpack (depending on need). When I run heavy gunner, have to take a lot of the strength perks off, but I keep thru hiker, traveling pharmacy, and batteries included equipped. This plus calibrated shocks on my PA legs keeps me around 225/350+, usually.
---
Now you know my secrets üòÅ
---
If you don‚Äôt claim legendary run rewards before the run is over, you might lose them. 
---
I don‚Äôt know the calendar overlap here, but if you wait for the sale without claiming legendary run rewards in time, you might be in trouble
---
This is Synth propaganda! 
---
(Seriously though don‚Äôt downvote this guy for giving the actual explanation smh)
---
Ahhh, man, I'm a lvl 25 bow build sitting here with my small backpack wishing I could even approach Colossal. I mean, I've got a sweet lvl 5 Unyielding raider arm, so that should protect me right?
---
I keep seeing people having this problem.  I've died a few times during this event and have yet to have any issues.  Sorry for your luck
---
You're Velcome.
---
Welcome to videogames you snowflake
---
If you're on console theyres no chance they were cheating, I pvp everyday and god mode has been patched. People used to use it allllll the time but bethesda actually fixed it this time because of its association with completing the legendary run.
---
 I have 3 pvp characters and my second one was completely built and perked out at level 58. I also have a level 30 pvp character who melts high level pvpers. (I dont pick on pve players because there is no fun to it, and people only do that because they can't hang with actual pvpers)
---
Really? Well that‚Äôs good to know Lmao. I would have traded regardless, have copies of blue ridge stuff. Convenience of not having to do events to get it
---
10 4 to that
---
Agree.  They should really have most or all things available at all times, just rotate the discounts.
---
I missed out on the seedy shed for literally months because they didn't offer it again until recently.
---
Had they just made it available full time, I would have spend money to get it.  Instead, they had a bunch of stuff rotating in and out I didn't care about, so 0 money spent.
---
It's not just that shed.  It's a few other things I didn't have the money to get until the week after it was no longer available.
---
The cake is a lie. Mutant says eat pie.
---
There will be a 76 beret but that's about it
---
So, just because games were broken 20 years ago, it's ok to make broken games now and charge people at every opportunity, including for basic things, then slap a subscription on top while releasing broken update after broken update even when the players test it and advise on fixing it doing all the QA for them free of charge... 
---
This type of apologist mindset is why it continues to happen. They make money off broken products and don't even need to pay PR salaries when there's people like you ready to defend them for free.
---
&gt; There's a bug here and there.  
---
- Challenges have been autocompleting for month. Those same challenges that have a $ value attached to them robbing people of time and $ equivalent. But you seem to condone a company actively robbing people so that already is fine with you.
---
- Game breaking bugs in quests that remained there since BETA
---
- Broken Atom Shop items 
---
- Broken interface where people don't show online for months now
---
- Rampant hacking in PvP
---
- Broken Atom Challenges 
---
And those are just off the top of my head. Tell that "there's a bug here and there" bull to people that lost 10+ ranks to autocompleted challenges and now only have a chance at completing the run if they pay.

Furious on Live, if you‚Äôre staying on target. Furious resets when you hit something else, but Gatling lasers fire hella fast, it only takes them half a second of fire to cap out Furious, so it may not matter much. AA also doesn‚Äôt work properly on energy weapons. 
---
If the damage changes ever go through, POTENTIALLY AA but that requires a lot more investigating.
---
I run full health PA build, so you‚Äôll typically find me in T65 equipped with a medic pump. Outside of PA, pieced together a full set of BOS Vanguard Armor over time. Fireproof perk set to max. Beyond that, I‚Äôve not put a lot of scientific research into armor, tho. 
---
For weapons, I typically prefer a mix of AA, Furious, and Vampires. Gauss minigun with a vampire effect lets me stand toe to toe with the imposter during Encrypted. A Furious Flamer can really take down foes fast, particularly mirelurks kings. Final Word is my go to 50 cal. Also, for the right weapon, Zealots can be very effective for SBQ fights. I primed a Zealots Gauss minigun just for that.
---
Like I said, I found a formula that works well and been adjusting as I go. What I like is I rarely die. If I do, it‚Äôs usually because of sloppiness and not giving myself a stimpak in time.
---
Interesting factoid. ‚ÄúThunder pipe‚Äù is the literal translation of the dutch word ‚Äúdonderbus‚Äù, which is the origin of the term blunderbuss, the weapon that skin resembles.
---
Edit:typo
---
This is the dark secret of anything that has closed beta/qa/PTS/etc.
---
Yes, they might catch more issues before content releases, but that says *nothing* about if they actually get fixed or not.
---
Cheers! üéä

Combat shotgun to the face, gunfu and adrenaline perks   Should take care of at least 6 wendigos before running out of AP
---
When I did it with a group of 5 others, we could not find the way back up to the top and the final loot chest. When we finally did we were way too late. I really hope that they up thw amount of time you have after the boss fight.
---
Honestly, I'm surprised they haven't increased it to 1,000 yet.
---
You're not taking into account missed shots. Easier to land more while firing faster.
---
I hope that won‚Äôt be all they end up doing
---
The fuck is that supposed to mean? Video games are evil? And calling me a snowflake? That doesn‚Äôt even make any sense. Are you like 10 and repeating what you hear your dad yelling at the TV?
---
I actually friend them and make more ammo together.
---
Yesterday I ran a silo, launched a nuke, waited for he event to start, dropped down. We are unloading into it, getting the hang of the fight.. Then a Melee guy runs up out of nowhere, two hits... Event over.... WTF? He didn't even have a chance to scream and scare us. I felt robbed of the experience and then had to run out of there. Sheesh.
---
That is exactly what happened to me. I was too busy making this face üò± to punch the screencap button. Cheers!
---
Dafuq is high powered barrels? U mean tri-barrel?
---
On another note, i saw a few traders over at the Fo76 Discord trading top tier weapons for Anti Armor variants at a 1:1 rate. Things like Handmade Bloodied/25%/25% for stuff like anti-armor explosive 90% weight light machine gun.
---
I asked around and one told me that they expect the anti-armor prefix to be close to the top with one Wasteland. What do you think?
---
Agree.  This new terminal system isn't better than the old one, it's just different in how it sucks.
---
And since you can't exit (because there is literally no exit the terminal menu option) besides pressing your "back" button a ton of times, it really motivates you not to use it at all.
---
If anything, the sell and buy options should've been kept separate, but the multipliers for buying and selling should've been made more granular, like 5x instead of 10x, with options only being shown if you had the ammo, like before.
---
All that said, the terminal system is no good.  We really needed something similar to the Legendary Vendor or Bullion Vendor machines.
---
Just sell your ammo, then spend ammo points.  Another commenter in the past said that making ammo vending machines at train stations use ammo points was a good idea.  I second this.  The ammo converter at your camp could just be a personal version of this, with the "regular" version being available at train stations.
---
yeah. i don't need somewhere to keep my stuff. absolutely useless feature.
---
Lol... and a happy cake day to you as well. 
---
The cake is a lie though.
---
PIE.
---
I guess with the bug where people get kicked from the event is pretty prevalent, because it's not fun to stare down 15 wendigos and the colossus because everyone else in the event got kicked from falling debris appearing on top of them for 900 instant fire damage. The delay for dying multiple times is brutal. A whole minute of staying in time out on an event that won't let you loot the boss or loot the chest if you die, or even not even let you complete the event if you die? It's so harsh. I get that the atmosphere of Fallout is supposed to be punishing and brutal, but I think Bethesda forgot that we're all trying to play a game here.
---
If you rush doing the legendary run then you just have to wait for the next one.  My suggestion don‚Äôt rush it next time, Just go for the one you want and don‚Äôt grind out the xp one.  I only expected to get to level 71 but am now aiming for 91 and I don‚Äôt do the level up each day, NW  any, or the legendary kills unless I come across them.  Don‚Äôt make the legendary run the reason to play, play for the other stuff too.
---
Took me and a friend a minute to find it as the quest marker doesn‚Äôt line up with where you need to go. It‚Äôs a back room so I‚Äôd say make a right off the elevator then maybe another right and the terminal you‚Äôre looking for is on the left inside that room (I think... if I remember correctly). I remember that if you sneak you should only run into one protection.
---
Characters and progress carry over, Atoms and 1st subscription don't.
---
I havent been playing long, but I got the Red Scare skin in the shop now as its the coolest one I've seen other than that Captain Cosmos Astronaut power armor. In terms of the actual armor itself Ive been using Excavator as thats what was reccommended to me but I like the look of the T-65 and X-O1 sets.
---
That's a relief
---
Keep trying! Happy virtual bday.
---
But I‚Äôm not defending them? Did I say i was proud to be playing a broken game? I play games to have fun and I did have fun playing it. 
---
I bought the game once. I have never tossed money at them at all except for my initial payment. The people who are actually supporting them are the people paying for atoms and the sub.
---
Me too!
---
i sure hope the steel dawn are an outfit... ive been loving using the bos fatigues as one :( but i also like that they dont bloat your character out if you have underarmor on so im hoping the steel dawn dont do that either
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help.
---
Everybody running around with legacy weapons and a stagnant game economy is pretty annoying, but the ammo machine is right up there.
---
&gt; Beth doesn‚Äôt owe you anything mate

&gt; I'm not defending them

At least don't contradict yourself this blatantly when caught up. The end.

When you‚Äôre already firing 9 rounds a second, 25% more isn‚Äôt really going to change that. Like I said, this isn‚Äôt a 44 revolver situation. And we‚Äôre talking about Earl. He‚Äôs not exactly a hard target to hit. He isn‚Äôt a ghoul sprinting sideways across your screen 100 feet away.

I mean i liked rifles but fore rate on my gun is so low I hated it. If I didn't one shot the enemy I was almost dead by the time I got another shot off. With a fixer thats not an issue but I just got the plans for that. And have no bloodied version obviously. At least by getting both sets of cards I can go back and forward between builds

You need to improve your weight management. A lot of people who play fallout games horde things that don‚Äôt need to be horded

Thanks for the answer! but for clarification, does the Atoms limitation mean specifically Atoms brought with real money (not earned through gameplay) or all Atoms?
---
Tried it for the first time today...did not enjoy it. Only four other players spawned in with me. Overall the boss is just a big damn sponge - couldn't finish it in time. Wish there was some interactive mechanic that could deal large amounts of damage to boss if used correctly.
---
That would be awesome
---
So if you die inside the mine do you lose your junk?
---
Actually the pickaxe is bloodied.

Wait, that's been fixed? Hot damn I'm jumping back into the game

It made me go üò±

Any that show on the account, purchases carry but not Atoms themselves or subscription.

Yeah, but now I also can't purposefully time my visits to wake him up in his trailer because screw that guy
---
Vats is broken on almost everything in pvp. Still works on explosive lasers, railways, and gammas. It‚Äôll work on melee some too, but it‚Äôs not consistent. Get yourself a ffr railway and put the auto receiver on it. They‚Äôll eat up the average pest without much effort, even if you‚Äôre not perked for it.
---
I've been managing my weight to the best of my ability, if you have any tips that would help that would be great.
---
The BOS are technically soldiers gone AWOL, so it makes sense for the US Government to not be on the best terms with them
---
you‚Äôre actually just using the already made tunnel
---
No way!!
---
My thought exactly. They should also add legendary scrip machines to the settlements.
---
Making sure all your junk is scrapped into base components before storing is a big one, and adding the lightweight mod to any armor you‚Äôre storing also
---
I like the exclusivity. If everyone has something then it isn't special anymore. I feel special running around in the Dark Matter PA but eventually everyone will have it and no one will care.
---
&gt; although to be fair, they‚Äôre down there not affecting anyone, so we‚Äôre basically invading someone‚Äôs home and murdering them
---
Did you not notice all the flesh and blood in the room? Plus all the Wendigo spawns it somehow makes that fit through the tunnels/holes the colossus can't get through.
---
Yes.  The Order of Mysteries was my favorite questline  / faction by far in the game.  It was tragically underused, and the fact that you could easily sell the items and not ever be able to get them back is criminal.
---
Plus, for all the dude avatars that finished the questline, meeting up with the remaining order survivor(s) and being all, "Yes, that's right fellow mistress, just us girls here." and seeing her (their?) reaction(s) would be just hilarious.
---
There's a tangible difference between the government and the Enclave. One is the federal government and the other is a highly covert sect within it. A worst case scenario, comparable to the illuminati. Yes the BoS are "AWOL" (as AWOL as you can be after the complete destruction of society and government) and originally Maxson's group began by eliminating the scientists af Mariposa but the point remains that the Enclave isn't very well known about at this point in time.
---
Yeah bro, it was awesome.  She was begging for my gulper slurry.
---
Takes less effort to keep scrolling haha. Didn‚Äôt know it was such a big issue sorry to salt your wounds
---
2 hits?! What sorcery is that?!
---
Damn, thanks again for the answer though
---
Junkies is next best for damage. Furious is after that. Then AA. 
---
It‚Äôs worth noting that the current changes to damage formulas on the PTS make AA *much* more powerful- to the point that I think it supersedes anything but bloodied in most cases. I compared a primed AAE 50cal to a primed BE 50cal on my optimized bloodied build, and the AA was only doing about 10% less damage. Although to be clear it‚Äôs not actually changing AA at all, it‚Äôs that the rework lowers the effective bonuses of the others, but doesn‚Äôt change AA, which makes AA much more powerful *relatively*. But that‚Äôs all PTS. Who knows when it goes live, or if it even goes live in it‚Äôs current state.
---
i like to not have anything in my vendors.

Levels don‚Äôt mean a whole lot TBH. There are some low level troll characters that are absolutely lethal, that‚Äôs probably what you found.
---
Can I ask why?
---
You joke, but if Bethesda did something similar to this, wouldn't shock me at all.
---
Re-using the Enclave I totally understand, but going out of their way to shoehorn the brotherhood into Appalachia when it's on the other side of the country made me raise an eyebrow.  And I LIKE the Brotherhood.
---
I would've liked to see them use some imagination and make another paramilitary faction.  I liked what they did with the Responders and Free States, I think they could've made something fun an interesting with military / ex military as well.
---
I was going to use daily challenges but an autocomplete two days in the same week pissed me off.  Hopefully it works out for you.

You can't put any combat rifle paints on the fixer. One of the community managers said they were looking in to it

MECHANIC JUMPSUITS
---
We have so many cool jumpsuit variants (forest camo, nuka colas, whitesprings, vault tec) and while they look cool as an outfit, imagine them with armor? 
---
Raul Tejada type shit.
---
Also won't break you stealth immediately
---
I think we had a hacked SBQ melting weapon in the last run I was in.  Earle melted in less than 2 minutes.  I was frankly really shocked.
---
I hate to imagine how bad it would've been if we didn't have that.
---
Explosive is highly overrated and basically useless except in heavy weapons or legacy weapons because it‚Äôs damage is calculated based off the base damage of the weapon without perks or anything
---
And it breaks your weapon quicker
---
Literally I just want the atoms from these bugged challenges. The dailies were fine before they didn't need to drop them by some thousand atoms. Even still, not broken challenges would be nice for a change
---
let‚Äôs do it, my gametag is wureide I sent an request
---
Oh it breaks stealth? I never knew that
---
I thought BGS really missed an opportunity on this one.  Why not have to use a Fat man to clear the entrance, and then wake up earl once you are in.  If not for all the reasons you mentioned but for making an almost useless but fun weapon important in the story line.  Not to mention the silo runs have become tiresome for many players.
---
The lobby timer could have been waiting for an NPC to make the 8 person elevator work. If your friends won't fit on the elevator, wait for the next elevator.  That way one friend is left in the lobby going WTF. Respawn timer is the elevator ride.  Kill earl and the elevator breaks and you have to find your way out!
---
I have no answer why we need to break into someones home and kill and destroy everything we see, but I don't have an answer for that IRL either.

I usually put my gun away, which has gotten me into trouble. It‚Äôs nice to know that these might work too - thanks!

Nah. It‚Äôs an endgame fight. If people aren‚Äôt equipped to handle it, they shouldn‚Äôt be there.
---
on my way to alpha silo ;)
---
I have a question. Lately at high number kills events (ex. Line in the sand and colossus) some areas with meat piles, suddenly have pixels and you move slow and it is really laggy. Anyone else witnessed it? What gives?
---
Outfit/armor hybrids look so cool (sometimes), I used to do this in Fallout 4 with an armor overhaul mod. Preston would look so fly in his combat armor reinforced colonial duster. 
---
I was super excited to put Christmas themed armor over the Santa costume but they didnt release a patch for the Holiday workshop üòî
---
Yeah I sell a lot of outfits, not much armor.
---
I agree.
---
Getting damage is not that big deal here either. I got rid of the power armor lately, because I am always overload when I switch to the power armor and I don't see the difference. But the last few times the SBQ did not land too often or I was too far away then. So most of my shots were too distant.
---
I've also noticed it in Project paradise. The thing is the lag stopped when I rented so it must be a combination of things
---
There's a lot of broken challenges people just don't notice, apparently Sludge Lung can stop counting for Get Diseases as well.
---
Yeah that loot chest isnt all that special in my experience.
---
Yes, I had a feeling I was going to get to ally today, so I doubled checked before doing my dailies and even looked up the different ranks
---
Without that it takes 10 to 15 minutes with good players, likely timeout if it happens to be casuals/non optimised builds.
---
That‚Äôs where mine is. Only thing is now that people on PTS say lvl 100 scorch beasts are bullet sponges, I wonder how much I‚Äôll have to repair my camp.
---
Probably not, but my point stands: only way of getting it, is by running out in time and loot it ;)
---
I haven't played in a long long time, like over a year I think, and I only got to level 25.
---
Should I just restart to get caught up on changes?
---
Way ahead of ya, chief
---
Are those regular mods for the combat shotgun? Or some kind of glitch? I haven't found too many mods I found useful I guess. Most stuff I came across is for "weapons" like the walking stick or that wrench (playing non-english, so I am not too sure about the correct names for these tools).
---
Oh yeah, but only for a short time. Not days/weeks after, left outside in the Cranberry Bog.
---
Nothing dead stays active for that long.
---
I believe you still max out at 15 even with legendary perk SPECIAL boosting cards.

&gt; Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass.
---
I haven't gotten a jetpack yet and I honestly thought this is how you did it. Ew. I can't believe it's programmed like that. They sell so many skins for them too.
---
Yes, up to 15.
---
Okay, I will take a look what I can do in those categories.   
---
I play on PS4 and my actual build looks like this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e864d65&amp;d=sp2sd2so2su2lt2p02pc2a72ic4ib4c72pq1eh2ej2s01iq2l71as2&amp;n=Quad%20Explosive%20Shotgun](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=e864d65&amp;d=sp2sd2so2su2lt2p02pc2a72ic4ib4c72pq1eh2ej2s01iq2l71as2&amp;n=Quad%20Explosive%20Shotgun)
---
What ever happened to the datamined mining outfit from a while back?
---
Auto receiver, suppressor and 1 other mod I forgot should put you to -6. You HAVE to use vats. It won‚Äôt work ADS.
---
About once a week. Usually in NW.
---
For real? My friends and I have yet to get that one. Everything but so far.  
---
Even got 3 gas masks.
---
I do. I'm saying they're kinda lazy with 76. That's not an opinion either. There's so much they could do. Instead they did a ton of copy paste, failed to deliver on promises, especially with FO1st, and overall dont even understand their own game. Just take a look at the Atom Shop. Lots of things in there are buggy.
---
Limitations is just a part of it.
---
But do explain how the world works. I'll listen.  Even though smaller studios have done far more with, obviously, less resources and larger games. But, go on.
---
I have a vault Tec university jumpsuit that I can wear over armor. It‚Äôs almost what we want lol.
---
That's okay.   Even three more points in a few categories would allow me to equip some powerful perks.   So many good perk cards, so few SPECIAL points.  ;)
---
Fantastic!!
---
I imagine there is a lot of people who will share this feeling with you and probably not say anything. I'm so burnt out right now it's not funny. 
---
I'll come back and check things out if they add anything new after meat week (I missed the last one).
---
No clue. I just saw Earle's health bar drop in two chunks and it was over.
---
In adventure mode, I have once in the past month. Playing 4-5 days a week. A couple hours each day.
---
Levels honestly don't really mean anything if you're bad at PVP just use the railway rifle and headshot with vats it will kill someone with full Sentinel assassin armour spamming nuka Cola quantums instantly. Vats only works on non hitscan weapons with some exceptions like explosive damage but it's not worth it
---
Yeah.....
---
Not sure how it made it into the game as a paid item with its current issues. I have a large metal warehouse door on a track at one of my clients about as big as the door is suppose to be and I could make a recording with a high quality mic and edit and tune it and then load it into the ba2 archive myself and probably make it sound better than the one they shipped. 
---
Kind of inexcusable in my opinion, but unfortunately my expectations have been shattered dozens of times before. I put a ticket in to get my 1k atoms back.
---
There's a reason most people use heavy guns at a queen fight.
---
They should make the pass a bit easier as well as this
---
I had this issue about a month ago, I checked my modem logs and discovered it was my ISP‚Äôs fault, there were constant DNS resolution errors between my modem and their network, changed my DNS to a public one (through my modem, not my PS4) and it resolved my issue.
---

---
You might need to check the datamining discord, havent seen anything new yet.
---
I had it on to start tried removing it and adding it back no love
---
mod in personal inventory
---
The Vault 94 Mask, which looks exactly the same as the Forest Scout Mask, is 1650 gold as well.
---
But it protec...
---
7600 hours is just insane, that is literally a full years worth of hours non stop. I only have 8800 hours clocked in across all of my steam games. I've been playing on PC since I was 12, I'm 18 now, that's 6, fucking, years. They expect us to play Fallout 76, as our only game ever, for 5 god damn years.
---
I will in on in about a hour I have around 8 cards as well. Gamertag is Fullytron
---
Gonna suck to be bloodied lmao; literally everything is gonna end up killing them constantly.
---
I also still have game crashes about once an hour. I‚Äôm on a PS4 pro
---
Yeah, I have gotten it twice so far. It‚Äôs Bloodied w/ 40% more power attack and 90% reduced weight. The only thing I have yet to receive is the gas mask.
---
I might look into my modem. Haven‚Äôt rebooted it in a while.
---
Doesnt that have foliage attached though?
---
We've spent the whole game murdering Mole Miners, who just seem to be minding their own business.
---
Never as in I play with someone else as a team... but even so, I don't think I do enough damage to solo him. Full health sneak rifleman/commando. 
---
We're getting close to attempting duo runs of this kind of thing on private servers though, so maybe I should never say never? :)
---
prepere your ass for the nerfs :)
---
Ok thanks for the clarification.
---
I haven't put it on yet - the image doesn't show foliage.
---
It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm used to it. While I‚Äôve made some friends here, others have been upset enough to follow me around and send nasty DMs and downvote my comments. It‚Äôs amusing.
---
I appreciate the moral support, though!
---
Earl has a much higher energy resistance than a regular damage resistance so it‚Äôs better to use ballistic damage.
---
Well that makes sense and also proves that all this panic is false without any real context; molerats would lose to radscorpions no matter if they were the same level or not.
---
2 in 50 ish hours of playing over the course of a week and a bit.
---
Completed the Workshop score weekly with my main and support in a single session with no DC.
---
Had 12 workshops claimed between the two by the time Ieft the server.
---
Both crashes on an OG, no crashes on the Pro.
---
If the Atom Shop was making them plenty of money when they were giving free atoms, as you said, then it seems weird for them to change it because of money.
---
if you have more than 100 of a scrap you dont use, bulk it and sell it to an npc vendor. that'll clear up a good chunk of stash space AND get you some caps.
---
Assuming they sort by new. If they sort by ‚Äòhot‚Äô, they‚Äôre less likely to see it.
---
Your link appears to include the new rewards too like the Chally Moo Moo outfit so hopefully it is the correct information for this week. Does anyone know if the tenderizer is a plan now or just a weapon drop like last year?
---
Wow. There‚Äôs something wrong on my end then
---
Where do you find these rp groups?
---
It wasn't too bad for me until this last updates. Almost seems daily I'm signed out entirely or blue screen and have to restart the app
---
I'll check that out too. Thanks for the idea
---
900 hours here. 
---
You just need to learn how to manage your stash.
---
&gt; Stay online to farm the hours.
---
I hope there's not a person stupid enough to keep the game on for 7600 just to earn $4 worth of atoms. The electric bill alone would make this have no sense.
---
Omg hah what an original joke that definitely hasn't been parroted 50,000,000 times.
---
I get motion sickness with lag sometimes. Playing in third person helps.
---
Not possible
---
Played since Day 1 of BETA. I've probably been disconnected from the server 10, maybe 12 times, total. Blue screen crash an average of one a month.
---
i remember back during beta there was a Vault 76 trucker hat (which i got) but i havent seen it rotate back to the atom shop for a long time. i mean it could just be because i already own it, or because it is always available, so it doesnt come up in rotations. i dont know. anyway, that's one 76 themed item.
---
I hope you got video of that. lol
---
Doesn't work on Xbox either. I'm still not able to complete the same quests that OP mentioned despite having done them numerous times. Bethesda didn't do shit about either one when I submitted my tickets.
---
Camp must be near a random spawn point that has a good chance to spawn them in; even so never seen 2 at a time even with friends living at their locations. Awesome!
---
Absolutely love my Furious napalmer. But man, it will break or run out of ammo at the worst possible times.
---
found answer robot armor torso enameled is bugged and can not be crafted
---
So where does a  AA gauss minigun stand in this mix?
---
You're not missing anything.  System goes off, SB flies past (unless it bugs out), you trigger SB trap. Kill SB.
---
I think I read somewhere that tenderizer plans will drop.   I could be wrong though
---
I like JE for bumming around and doing events like rad rumble and line in the sand. J2525 s better, especially for sbq, colossus and imposter.
---
J5025 is my favorite of the bunch. But all 3 are great rolls.
---
Ironically, it didn‚Äôt start out as a joke. Rather as a random thought at 2 AM, but hey whatever floats your boat.
---
So much this!!!
---
Coming back to say thanks for the tip.  I spent 5 hours last night combining things to various levels of success.  Fun was had.  Spank you!
---
Plenty of money doesn't mean enough, buddy. They put in work to change it which cost them money. No company would spend money if ROI didn't make sense. But I'm excited to see your counterargument to that change, assuming you have one beyond "then it wasn't money".
---
Damn. Thanks for the quick response.
---
Hmm I did try VATS on one or two, but they did fuckall. What perks precisely are magical then? Maybe mine weren't after all.
---
I'm sure u/gilpo1 will assemble a spreadsheet for them. Until then, you can fiddle around with the chance tool. It depends on how good the event completes. Examples
---
[Bad completion](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P21A&amp;formids=005566CA-00553EDE-0055549B):  0.77% for the meat tenderizer &amp; plans, 3.1% for some other stuff

---
The parameterization indicates that you get the beer stein plans as long as you don't learn them (also probably not tradeable so no reason to hoard).
---
I can kill the Colossus in about 5 minutes with a bloodied minigun, idk why it would take the full time to kill it.
---
I'm sure you'll smash a duo run. I've seen a few pop up already and it seems manageable as long as the server behaves. If I can give any advice at all, Sneak helped me a lot and without it I definitely would have ran out the clock
---
Right.  The truth is, while Bethesda does go back and incorporate some of the PTS feedback, more often than not, they have some very odd "it has to be this way" design choices that they will not abandon no matter how much people complain.
---
And I'm not talking about things like the upcoming damage nerf.  I'm talking about things like why is the exit so hard to find in Earle's boss room?  Why wouldn't you want that to be a bit obvious?  Or why, exactly, we have to scrap Perk Cards, to get Perk Coins, to buy Legendary Perks.  Why not something straightforward like "Hey, you reached the next 50th level, go and get a Legendark Perk"?
---
No developer ever explains or attempts to defend their reasoning.  It just is.
---
&gt; ~~Perhaps~~ it's plain laziness
---
The linked doc shows a melee weapon plan for "meat tenderizer" which I would assume is supposed to be the tenderizer plan.
---
r/nobodyasked
---
That appears to be THIS years.
---
The Chally outfit and backpack has surprisingly high drop rates.
---
And everyone gets the stein the first try! nice!
---
No they don‚Äôt. But they know that a few people would.
---
It‚Äôs also a way to keep track of
---
Total play time.
---
I didn't *want* to but I inadvertently killed the new boss (from full health to dead) in about 10 seconds. I knew I was using a magic weapon but I didn't expect it to go that fast.
---
i got the trophy with Squintyhippo's help, if you still needing help I usually get on 10/11 pm EST and stay on until about 1:30-2:00am EST..... username THSNAKE80
---
Oh, everyone else gets to humblebrag about their characters, I thought I could, too.
---
I‚Äôm just awful at PVP in general. My build works against typical NPC baddies, but my armor is no better than a wet paper bag against other players despite wearing legendary lvl 50 Heavy Combat Armor with the Brotherhood of Steel mod. I‚Äôve given up on hunting down wanted players.
---
Damage will be nerfed in the next patch, which ends up making A Colossal Problem palpably more difficult if they don't adjust Earle's HP to compensate for the lower damage output of players.  It's pretty simple.
---
Wait, isn't the challenge outfit whats in the atom shop this week?
---
Honestly don't care enough to try to pick through that post.
---
That‚Äôs so awesome, I wanted to buy it just for the hood. A saw someone a while ago with a black hood with the horns on it and really wanted on ever since
---
Dirty outfit is the reward.
---
No it‚Äôs in other comments
---
That's a hard no from me.
---
We got our rewards. It was dead easy for some players by using glitches and exploits to finish the Legendary Run. Not saying that due to the exploiters everyone should be punished. These exploiters are a good indication XP farming is a terrible mechanic. Why? It ruins the playstyle for a lot of players.
---
We'll see what Bethesda comes up with for the next Season. Then we can discuss if early finishers get other rewards for completing dailies. Something like fireworks, ammunitions, caps, or lunch boxes. In the end we play for fun and not for rewards? I could see they add treasure notes as most dailies takes about the same time to finish as group event.
---
In my opinion SCORE is good replacement of ATOMS. ATOMS would get hoarded by veterans when Bethesda would not pump out enough shop items. So basicly they had to pump out 1 batch of items to get people spend the free ATOMS and then a second batch for people to buy ATOMS so Bethesda would generate enough cash to pay the bills. Imagine one of those batches fails to please the players and they only spend their free ATOMS? In the end you would see more perks and convience items being put behind a paywall like Fallout First to generate more $$. So I really hope they will never add daily ATOMS reward again. (and for the record I have a FO 1st year subscription, but we need buy-to-play players to have a healthy population on the servers)
---
it is.
---
Ah I see. Just the the Brahmin grill. Gotcha.
---
Whoever is in charge of creating meshes for this game needs to get shitcanned. There are *always* issues with hitboxes and meshes on the atom shop items.
---
I don't help.
---
I take their lunch money and their rad-away.
---
Chuck Norris got there first.
---
(Wasteland Thumbs Up Emoji)
---
Should be ok, that's ballistic damage.
---
Thank you for the tag! We have this issue recorded. I am not sure what patch this will make it into to but it is assigned to someone.
---
Then there's the one that shows up to let you collect ore during that other event down there.

Sweet maybe they updated it, the post I stole it from said it was last years rewards, because the commenter wasnt in the PTS yet.

Oh bleh. Everyone is saying that enemies aren't tougher. I always go for the headshots.
---
It does have foliage on it. Though if you have one from the vault raid it lost its foliage
---
Talking about meat tenderizers with beefytrout and beefmakesbadlube.  Good shit.
---
why specifically foodies? I must know.
---
I died right at the end of timer on event and got a dead body outside of cave graphic just scrolling in circles....reboot.Happened twice now. Been through it w 76  before, but seems more common with this event.
---
I get ya tbh.  Sometimes it's best to try and reduce the number of scrap you don't need by bulking it up and either selling it to either Vendorbots or Players.
---
Fasnacht Masks may not be the best example - but I'm talking about when a person has like 10 of the same mask or piece of generic clothing item and not a single Legendary Armor for sale.  That reads to me like you're trying to bloat the amount of Armor you have to sale.  Because you'll never have this mass of players rushing to buy, I don't know, the 10 Prisoner Collars you have on offer.
---
Bird Bones helps me a bunch with this :)
---
While you're at it can you give me my atoms?
---
It's justified for me just to kill her father because he thought cannibalizing his dead friend so he could survive was a bad thing and boo hooed about it in his journals. To me, as a proud cannibal (who managed not to succumb to turning into a wendigo), he's a disgrace and had to be put down.
---
Wait what?
---
When was this a thing???
---
Instigating is nuts for shotguns since each pellet instigates
---
Look up AngryTurtle Magic Shotguns on YouTube. (He‚Äôs a fantastic resource for all kinds of combat/game mechanics- it‚Äôs mostly what his videos are about, and he makes a ton! Solid investigations and demonstrations of what he talks about)
---
The TSE Dragon and TS Auto Grenade Launcher break *fast*.
---
Atoms have been refunded to people that lost them recently. Autocompleting score challenges have an equivalent atom cost to them. So why does a ticket about 30k score, or roughly 10 ranks=1500 atoms wiped gets closed with "sorry, no refunds", but atom challenges for 40-80/piece get compensated?
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter I guess if you can make it work and so can I, since mines an afk killer and even light footed won‚Äôt save you. 
---
Honestly surprised anyone even does em anymore with how big of a baby this community is. Props.
---
We are all about that beef life.
---
My first character is a shotgunner, I just wanted to try a melee only build since I've never done it in any game. Turns out, I love it, so my second character is now my main! I still even use a combat knife at lvl 136! I do want to try a Crossbow build. I have an Instigating one atm &amp; it's nice for quick sneak attacks, also I modded it to be explosive. Love it!
---
I've got one your welcome to
---
I run a full health Melee.  Hearing Nerd Rage, Serendipity, etc. activate every second or so...  don't miss it at all.  Just lagged my console with a bloody passion.
---
That might be a better example. Yeah I've just assumed they were people thinking they'd buy them for "dress up" who hadn't played long enough yet to realize how precious storage space is. I'll be honest in every other game I've played that's similar I've had a veritable wardrobe of silly cosmetics just for fun and I probably would in this game too if my stashbox could hold more than 12 items.
---
should i cancel the press conference?
---
You gave juicehead a lot of content with this post.
---
Yeh double thanks.
---
It takes maybe 5-10 ive found, as long as noone is using explosive weapons. My be laser pistol does 30 or so damage per shot, my b33 pipe revolver does 600. It seems to just have massive damage reduction against any weapon with the explosive effect
---
can you hear the crying of those legacy collectors with a jetpack on their arm?  
---
The longer they delay making changes that delete existing mod, the better. We have to bite the bullet. When they keep pumping out new jetpack skins, more people will be affected because I believe an overhaul would not only affect those arm jetpacks but all jetpacks.
---
Eh, they‚Äôre actively hostile to us and attack us on sight, so I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd say ‚Äúminding their own business‚Äù. 
---
But yes, there are multiple situations we go into their territory and fight them, so yeah, we‚Äôre no saints. This game doesn‚Äôt allow for much... negotiation.
---
No, no.  We have to make one about this breaking news now.
---
If they ever offer a white paint for it I'll gladly buy it to turn my Ally into a proper stormtrooper but until then it is way overpriced.
---
I‚Äôd buy a lot more if I had a camp budget.
---
Apparently it's possible to photo mode glitch through the grid and various doors.  Haven't done it myself but seen recent YouTube videos showing it
---
Funny, screw farm is exactly my takeaway from all the crashing and respawn bug reports yesterday. Never before has Bethesda implemented a more aptly named event in this game. I just look at everything that is A Colossal Problem from inception to now, and all I hear in my head is Owen Wilson saying ‚ÄúWow‚Äù.
---
Okay, I will keep an open eye for those. Or maybe mods in general ;) I normally use VATS.
---
They attack precisely because we invade their territory.
---
21 times? We now know that u live in Fallout. Dedication at its finest.
---
I have two pieces of poison resistant armor, so it‚Äôs not an issue, but I could see the problem for power armor guys.
---
You can find them through FO76Roleplay, by googling, or starting a post on here asking about them. If you look through the role play sub most people have started faction role play groups, albeit idk how active any of these groups are. Most just require you have discord to connect.
---
I can not
---
thats genuinely stupid, sucks how they have to implement it after the games release, or the weaposn release
---
Glad to see that this problem been noticed and has been assigned to someone. A lot of people would appreciate this. Thanks!
---
I think they should take a look at Halo MCC in terms of how they are doing their seasons.
---
Thanks I appreciate it, would you be able to say if doing the wastelander quests would be a big boost to their affinity? I'm lvl 76 but I'm still on the new arrivals and missing link quest so I don't know to much about anything in the game
---
These were easy to get in the Halloween event so you might get a chance this year too.
---
Patch 21 already contained this year's additions (Plan: Meat Tenderizer, etc.). Patch 20 is for last time.
---
Careful bro, you can get glowing pustules, flap limb, parasites, rad worms, swamp itch and weeping sores from that.
---
All I see is a mutated dodrio
---
I find it a pain when there are a bunch of people in thefe and my cursor is selecting all of them rather than the event icon.
---
Also, the real rewards are the friends we make at the cookouts.
---
Was somebody using automatic Tesla?
---
Find a vampire gatling Laser. You‚Äôll be almost invincible and you‚Äôll put a lot of damage on it. Try that and see what happens.
---
I hate this post, but thanks for making it
---
lmao
---
Ok, tell that to that constant flood of under lvl 30's that are showing up.
---
Extra space would be good. I waste so much time  every day fannying around with pure flux and crap and agonising about getting rid of that extra bulk acid.
---
Just be aware that it takes an insane amount of perk points to rank them up *currently*
---
First rank free, next 100, next 150, last 250. Total 500
---
You get 2 points per scrapped perk card. So fully ranking 1 perk requires scrapping 250 perk cards.
---
It‚Äôs an insane system that REALLY needs rework. Biggest thing IMO is decoupling legendary perk points from scrapping perk cards. You should just get points equal to the sum total levels of all characters on your account (you can‚Äôt go negative, but based on the highest total level, so you can‚Äôt keep making, leveling, and deleting a bunch of low levels to grind more perk points). I‚Äôm also of the opinion they need to re-evaluate the costs. As it is, maxing out 6 cards requires 1500 ‚Äúextra‚Äù perk cards. Which means you have to be around level 1500 to do so. 
---
Even ESO caps out at level 50(810), and if I understand it right the bonuses you get from the (810) are shared account wide. Currently in FO76 only unlocked slots are account wide; actual perk points are per-character.
---
Old vault raid mask is a legacy now cant get that variant of mask anymore.
---
Dead. Fall over countdown and everything. I‚Äôve also had the blackout and it‚Äôs basically the same thing. I have 3 characters almost maxed in caps so the loss of a few caps is minuscule if it even happens. I haven‚Äôt checked to know yet or not.
---
Cool. Thank you. I will add you. :)
---
I just realized that you are in EST not CEST. That might be tricky, but I will try.
---
I want an investigative journalist to look into this. As far as I know, Raider camp is the only place to get these plans.
---
Its especially an issue for people without fallout 1st, since they have to store regular junk and whatever theyre trying to store. Even if you could use seperate containers like a toolbox or a safe with less weight than the regular stash that would be an improvement in my eyes.
---
They were saving you from yourself. Its just a boring green boiler suit
---
First time no second yes
---
Well you can't get the now bugged one with no leafs. You can buy the v94 ask with gold though and it looks like it should
---
They attack literally anywhere we encounter them. If they‚Äôre trying to claim the entirety of Appalachia... yeah, not gonna fly dog.
---
I only have the one level 427 and I have tooled around with a few other builds. I have been playing fallout for 20+ years. I know what I enjoy, while this game is way different, I have never had the urge to bring a knife to a gun fight. That's just me. I'm glad you guys exist so I can sell the melee stuff I don't use. So thanks for that. 
---
On a side note how frustrating is it when the queen gets smoked in the air and you can't hit her?
---
I think not losing junk during an event death was purposeful so I don‚Äôt see them changing that any time soon if ever.
---
I will, that‚Äôs what voice chat is for.
---
It‚Äôs an explosive weapon type already without the prefix.
---
get the base versions of chest, arms, and legs. don't confuse them with the mods.
---
Patch 21 already had the new list but I wasn't sure of that until the hotfix.
---
Patch 20 version of the link shows last time's chances.
---
Check ore, gunpowder, hmmmm....... What else gets overlooked? Ohya, heavy/weird ammo. Not that hard buddy. Ive never even hit 8. I chill at 350-450 usually.
---
Note: onmy keep what you use. Sounds impossible, it's liberating AF
---
üëç
---
Where have you seen them otherwise?
---
You can milk anything with nipples.
---
The Bethesda events page lists meat week as starting September 22, so a month from now.  Unless their page has old info?
---
Explosive doesn‚Äôt benefit from any of the things that commandos usually run- stealth, crits, and headshots do not affect explosive damage. You can pop off a 1500 stealth crit headshot.... and do 70 explosive damage with it.
---
But not Woopsie
---
I totally agree with you.
---
I'm not happy with the current state of the game so I stopped playing a week ago or so and I do not regret that decision. I do regret the game, though, but it was just not fun for me anymore considering that the bugs drove me insane. As soon as those are taken care of, I'll gladly hop back in the train!
---
It could be some one with a TS mirv using the quick hands perk, lock and load perk, and fireworks reload glitch. I‚Äôm set up like this on my explosive build but without the fireworks
---
Yah basically just spend down your atoms before you switch.
---
My bugs/feedback. Agree with OP it needs some tuning, but overall is a very healthy and fun new bit of content. I am eager to go grind it some more when I get off work. 
---
- The corpse falls through the floor occasionally especially near the edges so half the rewards go bye bye and cannot be aquired. This only happened once for me out of six runs for me but still sucked.
---
- You get feared into the environmental aoe and or wall drills on the side which also kill you quickly. Dying is disruptive with the bugs so these issues need to be fixed asap. 
---
- Way too many wendingos. A set number per time duration would be more reasonable. As it is they crawl out of every crevice like ants so unless you are coordinated one or two or more people will just be constantly overwhelmed with staggers and not be dpsing the boss which needs to happen for it to die at all. 
---
- Staggers are too potent. If you get swarmed even if you try to jetpack/jump out you will still receive the damage after you should be well and clear from your perspective which lowering the wendingos number should help with. On top of heavy gun barrels needing to spin down before you can even stim its easy to get chain staggered to death. 
---
- The aoe/damage mechanics should reward awareness to your environment and avoiding it purposefully, not throw a dice on the ground when you get feared as to whether or not you will die.
---
Difficulty wise:
---
- I have no issues. I suspect the majority of players in the game are not running hyper-optimized builds (and that is okay) and this is a significant ramp up in difficulty even compared to the queen. I launched 6 nukes last night and completed the event each time with random public teams. It was actually kind of refreshing having to play it like a game. Its a little tricky being aware of if you're being targeted by wendigos or get swarmed, but the way most people play the game I have observed is they just focus on shooting colostrum and ignore all the ads which any mmo veteran will tell you is an easy way to get wiped.
---
I personally have never even seen a vampire's gatling Laser. But I don't think that would even do it. They drop your health down so far...you die by design. But if I run across one, you can bet I will use it!
---
This happened to me today. I'm new to the game, as in started this morning. Already had some guy dressed like that stealth ninja from Metal Gear Solid pop up and ask me to follow him, obvioulsy I thought I was gonna get shot to bits, but followed anyway. 
---
His base was amazing and he sorted me out with a load of gear. He then proceeded to help me build a shack, but unfortunately I had to log off for work. 
---
It was a very refreshing change from games I've played, like rdr2, where you feel like other player characters are just additional enemies. 
---
It really made me want to log in again as soon as possible and I've not had that in a multiplayer game for a while.
---
Look for "Plan: Secret Service Armor Legs", "Plan: Secret Service Armor Limbs", "Plan: Secret Service Armor Chest".  You'd want to purchase those first.  You can then purchase the Mods for each Limb, Chest, Arm, etc.
---
I mean,  we‚Äôre all supposed to be the best and brightest,  Wastelanders gave us the Dynamite recipe/plan.
---
Why can we not just use conventional explosives?
---
It's expensive, because of the flashlight attached to the side of the helmet.
---
That's fair. Personally I save my atoms because I fear I won't have enough Incase something DOES pop up that I want.
---
I'd buy more if I didn't have to worry about missing items I do want.
---
This XP grind is bad enough. I don't want any more reason to grind it harder. I can't wait to be done with it so I can actually have time to complete the game.
---
Never claim workshop on public server just because of that reason, guaranteed to disconnect. Else the game almost never disconnect.
---
Game over man, game over.
---
I was waiting on it ever since I saw a npc with it on, and with the pathfinder outfit from the raider bundle, its absolutely perfect
---
Just done it, nothing amazing. Worst part was fleeing the mine. Didn't have a clue if I was actually in the right spot. There was the quest marker floating in a pile of rubble, stood there for a while, and then got teleported out. That could be more obvious of an exit.
---
Also felt the environment was a bit dark. Never even saw the boss until some others started firing on it.
---
Two 3 start items though, so nice 80 scrip there.
---
My OC artwork: http://imgur.com/gallery/MifvdeE
---
i dont even care about looks, that flashlight is all that matters
---
High levels in fo76 = GOATs
---
Exactly! I mean I'm supposed to buy the plan for dynamite with gold bullion, but in this reality rocks are impervious to TnTüëå
---
There's been talk of AA being a viable choice *IF* the current PTS damage nerf makes it into update 22.
---
Can anyone confirm that Earl has double the ER?
---
Atoms?  What are those?
---
I have not collected Atoms all month due to a bug with Legendary.
---
The support ticket says it's fixed but I have to disagree.
---
  I just want to buy a fridge!
---
Yeah, but on the other hand, they went and put many of the Season 1 rewards into the Bullion vendors for players who weren't around for Season 1.  Lunchboxes are also a consumable you can buy for Bullion quite cheaply, while we all believed they were going to be Atomic Shop-oriented.
---
They don't always take the path of most monetization.
---
You're not supposed to be able to get the stuff on the atomic shop for free, it's literally there to support the continued development of the game... That's the entire point of it.
---
Not a new bug, originally appeared with encryptid a year ago then after some later patches spread to sometimes happen with any event death.
---

I got like 3 backpack plans. Ugly as hell. Gave me away to a buddy and have 1 left.
---
I did it with melee, but you definitely need support from other players. I switched between killing the spawns, and hammering on Earle. I have a tank junkie unarmed build and had to use 10-15 stims, but overall it wasn't too bad.
---
Is it not showing under Apparel?
---
I agree, having some 'apocalyptic' vault suit styles would be great.  
---
Sadly it's the kind of low hanging fruit that Bethesda's designers skip over, even if it would sell massively.
---
This bug is absolutely infuriating it happens all the time to me and many others, if you are a bloodied build it is more common as you usually stay at low health, as others are saying it isn't anything old, we are just putting up with it at the moment.
---
Bug 2: In addition there is also a fast travel bug which prevents you from fast travelling to put it simply when you choose to fast travel it doesn't move you to the selected location and instead closes your map and prompting you to do that all over again 
---
Rant, TL;DR:
---
I have lost the chance to gain my event rewards and loot the colossal wendigo because i've had to fast travel to a location that gives me a loading screen if i don't get a loading screen because its too close it wont fix it, and it will still occur very often even after fast travelling.
---
End
---
**\*\*However closing the game and starting it up again fresh seems to work the best.\*\*** 
---
Thanks for your effort, hope this long time bug is finally fixed.
---
Sorry. I say that from experience. I have one and used it during the imposter squach and stayed alive. 
---
Another thing you can do is, if you wear power armor, equip a torso with a medics pump. It will give you a stim if you fall below 50%. I didn‚Äôt do that the first time and it was close. I did it the second and it never had a chance to get me down to close to dead. 
---
Without the torso you should at least be able to put enough hits in before you die to get loot. Also equip power user level 3 and you‚Äôll have double the core strength. 999 shots because it just doesn‚Äôt have the digits for 1000. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Armour prefixes for high health are less important in general, at least one chameleon and possibly one life saving. Aside from that I tend to go vanguard.
---
Heavy weapons are my jam - if you want to cheese the game, look up magic weapons. If you want to be cheese free, I usually recommend AA on anything with less than 100 fire rate and Furious for anything above. Vampires is also ridiculous on high fire rate weapons to the point you're almost immortal, especially in t65 + stimpacks at 20% perk (name eludes me) + damage protocols.
---
Shotguns are unfairly unbalanced right now. Instigating is Ok. Vampires or medics explosives are both quite good as you get a heal per pellet. But really unless you have a magic shotgun you don't have much dps.
---
I don't find blocker that useful at high health - I use instigating unarmed weapons, stealth AA commando weapons and junkies/vampires heavy weapons mainly. Usually stuff dies before they get a more than one hit in. You won't miss it if you replace it :)
---
Bloody mess is my go to in luck, I can focus more on damage than survivability. 
---
Best of luck! :)
---
Shouldn't somebody apologize for the fact that it took 2000 missiles to get 100 railway spikes.. anybody else see an insult there or is it just me.. üòú
---
edit:  sorry flares .. to be fair  lamafromhell1324 paid for spikes he just got flares.
---
Judging from the radio broadcasts, it's safe to say that we won't see Roger Maxson any time soon.
---
Bethesda being bethesda, they most likely reused the base head they made for maxson as a preset with minimun changes. There's a lot of that in the game already, for example Dorsey is almost identical to Nate, that doesn't make the two characters connected in some way.
---
IDK, I sold a two star instigating explosive handmade for 15K the other day.
---
If someone wants it they'll buy it, if not, oh well go find it cheaper.
---
I carry one gun, purely to make scorchbeasts land &amp; shoot down the nuke keycard bots. I use The Final Word. Once the SB is down I switch to melee. It is highly frustrating though because I never used to carry guns at all, so when they get killed in the air, I just have to do angry emotes &amp; walk away üò™ 
---
And like you keep melee weapons for us folk, I keep ammo/make ammo for the gunners üëç Once a week I go on a private server &amp; farm steel so I can keep your boom boom sticks loaded üòÄ
---
Not always :-|
---
Haha, I do like this game. Its easy to get done when you and a few friends have private servers and you know how to do the door glitch through the silos. I can launch a nuke in 7 mins, from elevator to launch.  
---
Ill have to post a run though sometime.
---
Nm I got it. Earl has 220 DR 400 ER immune to radiation and 100 poison resistance. Good luck guys.
---
nice but i'll be out til tomorrow morning. ima add you in case i see you online.
---
I already bought the raider package so I didn‚Äôt really need another skin outfit lol, but I‚Äôll pay 400 atoms for the hood alone, I love the little horns. Ive been wanting a hood for a while but the only one I have is the green hood and it looks a bit silly without the outfit to match
---
Oh ok, thats good
---
The number of people who don't understand that employees need to be paid and equipment needs to be maintained is pretty shocking.
---
You'll get it soon enough. Stay vigilant.
---
PS4. That amazes me that anyone can stay alive as a conduit once they are spotted. That gun was a very nice find! I will definitely hang on to it should I ever come across one!
---
I just completed this challenge by chance mere minutes ago so this is like deja vu for me.
---
Your words might auto-complete like their challenges.
---
Do you have Fallout 1st?
---
I used berry mentats and also noticed he wasn't in that room early on in the quest.
---
When you complete the wastelanders quest there are weapon and armor plans that you make and are random legendaries.
---
Unless you need a Legendary Module to craft the weapon, then no.
---
Great post altogether, I wholeheartedly agree with all of your points and feel the exact same way you do. I honestly detest this FOMO system of marketing in any game that has it (which happens to be a lot of games with micro transactions it seems like). Being disappointed week after week of not getting items that haven‚Äôt been back in half a year of more. In my case, I have been waiting to get the vault boy and girl mascot heads and last I checked they were available in March of this year when I didn‚Äôt even own the game just yet, which really sucks. I have always felt that all cosmetics should be available, and what they could do in all honesty is have it where specific items can have limited time sales on them, either daily or weekly just like we have it now but instead with ALL AVAILABLE ITEMS IN STORE FOREVER and no more of this vaulting crap. It can work just like any store or business which offer limited time sales on certain items. The atomic shop pisses me off and I want it to be changed...
---
Whoah whoah there reasonable person....
---
Kidding aside, this is a point that all the people complaining about not enough free stuff fail to realize. 
---
They want the game to get better..... They want better free DLC.... The want better free season rewards.... They want to keep playing the game ....
---
But they want zero microtransactions via the ATX. They just want it all for free. 
---
Free smaller content. Free DLC. Free cosmetics. Some free premium currency? That's somehow not enough?
---
Only plans you get from gold bullion allows you to craft legendary with modules.
---
Soon the daily ops will reward plans that allows some new crafted legendary gear.
---
What system do you play on?
---
all good! ive had a handful of successful runs with deaths as well, just a few unlucky ones i suppose.
---
&gt; A good weekly challenge would be : play the game for 7 hours. Making people really explore / build / interact with other
---
All that would do is make people sit in chairs and AFK to run up the timer.
---
iT tAkEs lIke 30 MiNuTeS bro you are a fucking smart ass gtfo
---
Sad but true.
---
Plus flamethrower equals bad time for coronavirus dragon
---
I‚Äôve seen a couple at vendors so you might get lucky. I‚Äôve only ever rolled two. One max level and one mid level and I have over 700 hours.
---
"God tier" is possible at lower levels, especially if he devoted more work to his build and has better gear than you. It's also possible that he's just better at PvP.
---
He sounds super tanky. Which is possible. I've been running a leather set + level 45 junkie's handmade for awhile. I am a quantum build so I'm tanky. But even when I was in the level 30's with a more basic set of gear and a level 15 handmade, I still kicked ass because I know what I'm doing and a lot of people are squish.
---
Xbox, or used to. Pre-ordered it, sprung for the centennial edition, rushed home excited to play, played for a few weeks and never picked it up again.
---
It is near the entrance/exit of the mine. It first appears as INACCESSIBLE.   
---
The crate has nothing great in it, in my experience.
---
&gt; They want better free DLC.... 
---
Private Servers should've been free DLC but nah 13 USD a month
---
The SS underarmor is good if you get the shielded plan to go with it.
---
They did screw up fasnacht the second time. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised in the least.
---
I wonder what the system is going to be going forward.
---
Will all new weapons they add be craftable legendaries? If they are, will they all be non-tradeable?
---
I assume they wanna transition to that system to combat duping, though it definitely kills the player trading market.
---
Why should they have been? Because you say so?
---
Pretty sure it's one mod per piece of armor.
---
Oh no, honey. VATs for PvP broke after Wastelanders dropped. Some of us tested this. Hell, go test it on a friend to see what I mean.
---
For now try to join the event as soon as it pops up so you hopefully have a good number of people with you for the fight. Over time keep working on perfecting you build and gear. SH Games just posted a video of him soloing Earl without dying and without using a legendary weapon; it took him almost the entire 25 minutes but it seems doable.
---
Thank you for still taking care of this game
---
Why shouldn't they be? Why should people be forced to pay 13 USD a month to just play a true single player experience like every other Fallout game?
---
Y'all are dumb. Some of us are just tanky.
---
Yeah, im from s√£o paulo and the ping is really high, even picking a item take some seconds.
---
effort????
---
r/fo76disconnections
---
Source?
---
Increased spawn rates
---
I'd buy a lot more stuff if I knew it was going to work and not need a patch.
---
There's nothing I hate more than pre-orders... and that's exactly what buying stuff from the atomic shop feels like lately. A preorder for something they will get working later.
---
Really wanted the communist bunker, and I'm sure it will be fixed eventually... but I'll wait till it hits a "greatest hits" sale in 6 months I guess.
---
Agreed, I don't think I found the exit, despite the quest marker was hovering over a pile of rubble. That entire element of the encounter needs improving. Not really designed either for being encumbered (as I always am in power armour).
---
Personally don't see the point in the "Flee the Mine" step, let us explore the area after the boss kill and exit in our own time.
---
Thanks for trying though
---
They shouldnt go into your inventory, there should just be a missed loot thing like in borderlands that you can place in your camp and at the train stations a la borderlands
---
I completed kill 2400 enemies with a rifle with my shotgun.
---
When I was about level 8 a level 300+ guy gave me tons of aid and xp boosting food. 
---
Honestly did not expect the community to be so nice and caring. Need to find some people to play with lol.
---
Levels don't mean shit especially after level 50.

---
This obviously isn't the end all be all build but this is probably how I'd change it of I were personally running a full health build. Of course a lot has to do with your own play style and what weapons you can procure, quad explosive shotgun isnt a bad shotgun, but you could probably have more damage potential with the queen and elsewhere with the ones I listed. You also have a lot of missed potential for damage and defense due to the quality of life perks you have under intelligence, if you are keeping high inteligence to level faster I get it, so I listed carnivore for this reason but it also works with herbivore I just find carnivore easier to procure materials for recipies. Scrorchbeast brains when cooked five +3 to inteligence and with carnivore will give +6, with the perk strange in numbers you will get a total of +8 intelligence.
---
As far as the perks you have in inteligence you have 2 listed for weapon repair, if you do a lot of SBQ battles you should procure a large amount of improved repair kits over time which will repair for 150% weapon durability, this can help with your broken weapons. I would suggest playing with these perks off to test how long your shotguns last, personally I don't have a lot of trouble keeping my miniguns in working condition but shotguns could require more maintenance, just started diving into shotguns a bit recently.
---
Since strength based weapons are all close combat weapons their optimal range is basically in the queens face, the closer the better, if you want more damage you want to be right up on her. That being said I added 2 additional perks for damage mitagation, blocker to nullify 45% swipe damage and serendipity which will cause damage to be avoided entirely 45% of the time. To fit blocker in I removed scattershot, but if you are not already using it, I would suggest using the speed demon mutation for reload speed. Speed demon seems like it would be a terrible annoyance but isn't actually that bad.
---
I also removed lone wanderer and added a few perks that will help you if you are on a public team, this can obviously be reversed if you decide to play solo. I added herd mentality as the +2 to all stats triggers even if you are solo in a public team.
---
Listed below the perks I also suggested some legendary mods, additional mutations, and addictions if you decide to go the junkies route.
---
Also I didn't put this on there, but of you are worried about leveling quick, the egghead mutation can be quite nice.
---
Sorry for the word wall. Keep in mind, this is just my opinion, what really matters is what makes the game fun for you. I was hoping you were an xb1 player, I'd have shown you some of this stuff in action in the game. Hope it helps!
---
Ah, yes, adding all that extra infrastructure so that every copy of this online game can be played as a single player free of charge sure is a smart business decision...
---
The issue im finding right now is you get some people coming in just killing wendigos and looting them to not miss loot and not help with the boss. They get there few hits off to make sure they get their drop and xp but this way they get a lot  more XP and a ton of great drops like screws and its not fair on the rest of the party. Its an awful unteam like thing to do but Bethesda is pushing this kind of play with these kind of events and lack of proper social.
---
Me too. About once an hour for me also on a pro. I have 250mbps wireless connection and only taking up half my 1tb storage on a hybrid drive. I‚Äôm going to upgrade to a wired connection with the PS5 so hopefully this game works with that.
---
Don't most games (that have that option) charge for private servers?
---
Fallout 76 is not a true single player experience. 
---
It was never marketed that way. Bethesda blatantly described it as "very different"
---
Get over it. Why should they have to cater to an expectation you should have never had?
---
Compensate?.... you do know they were "free" atoms right? They were "gifts", you dont need literally anything in the atom shop to play the game, its all cosmetic
---
What they should be is more expansive with more options and features.   
---
( It's insulting that they haven't been updated yet considering the revenue they produce. )
---
Because it's not every other Fallout game, was never advertised as one and will never be? If you wanted a single player experience, why did you knowingly buy an online game?
---
Where are you getting this info about player count? 76 is one of the top played games on xbox most played list.
---
Buy some legendary modules.  You‚Äôll need them for SS stuff anyway.
---
If the sale date is not until Mid Sept, I‚Äôd venture you‚Äôll be bumping 1k again well before then.
---
&gt; shat it out when he saw me
---
You have 2 mod slots for different types of mod. 
---
First slot holds your DR mods like buttressed or hardened etc. Second will hold jet pack, pneumatic, dense etc on the chest, or cushioned, custom fit etc on the legs.
---
If you are not using what you are stashing now, why do you need more space?  To stash even more stuff you don't ever use?
---
I cant get the mods for the under armor to apply.  I craft them over and over but they dont show as applied.
---
[they were unable to patch unfortunately. ](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ic2o2p/_/g1ztevl/?context=1)
---
I have both masks on my alt. The secret service helmet is cool he looks like a storm trooper and the light is really really bright.
---
&gt;  why did you knowingly buy an online game?
---
Why did they turn a single-player focused game into a multiplayer?
---
Camp destruction was a blast.
---
I think the Fo76 nuke system is cool, but not enough changes happen during the nukes. The flora is cool and a nice touch, but the spawn density of enemies really needs to be upped. There should be behemoths, hordes, etc. Kinda like during the SBQ event when the Queen dies - that's what a nuke zone should be like. But rn they're mostly empty, kinda boring - even Whitesprings
---
They did what? That's delusional. They never turned any single player game into anything. They released a new, separate multiplayer game under an IP that also includes single player games. Nothing was taken and turned into anything. It was advertised as a multiplayer game from the start and that is what it is.
---
Put a 50 cal receiver in the hunting rifle, way more damage and you can make 50 cal 100 bullets at a time with zero perks
---
Yeah for sure some people would do this but not everyone.
---
Lots of players have a limited time to play , and they are spending most of their time doing the legendary run only to get some few free atoms. Instead of having fun arround and playing their own way.
---
Because they own the rights to a franchise and wanted to do make it an online multiplayer game?
---
Pair that with the huge nerf to dmg that is incoming and it's like a donation of 3000 steel and 1500 lead to the RNGesus faction. With a timelimit, of course.
---
So first off, your whole post reeks of salt, second off, vats doesn't work in PvP. Low level and high level damage is normalized in PvP, meaning a level 15 using a handmade will do the same damage as a level 500 in PvP. Levels don't matter, rolls and builds do. There is no longer a god mode exploit. The god mode exploit was repeatedly downing yourself with an energy weapon while a friend revives you until you get turned into an ash pile then revived. This is no longer possible. Calling hacks is rediculous when I know your build isn't optimized for PvP, his likely is. Or else you would know these things. A level 80 isn't a lowbie, that's someone's character with a refined build. I have a few level 80s with God tier gear. That's what alt characters look like typically. You got killed at a workshop, got salty and started whining on reddit. Time to face the music bro, the griefer won. You're still mad and he moved on to more victims. If anyone wants to learn how PvP works find ign Nekrosias, take a workshop, stay in open mic when I come for it. All ya gotta do is ask instead of getting salty on reddit
---
It could be neat if they included Silver Shroud stuff for all characters to be included in the group more formally. MoM and SS were lovers, so it could easily be integrated. They'd have to use a new version of it though since the Silver Shroud costume is already in the game via the Atom shop.

Thanks for your work duder!
---
And I totally forgot Bethesda was a small indie studio who couldn't do that lol.
---
Now I‚Äôm wondering if they did complete the event.   I died so many times I think I spent more time out of the cave than in it.   So maybe it‚Äôs possible I wasn‚Äôt there for the end run and gun exit I‚Äôm reading about in another post.
---
It was only fixed on pc as of now. Suppose to be a update later in the week for console.
---
Are both guns equipped with the same attachments and receivers?
---
Yeah, it's totally about being able to do it just because some guy on Reddit doesn't understand the product he bought, not about doing what makes sense as a business. You cracked it.
---
Exactly! idk why they cry about pvp
---
Thanks. You put down the same ideas I had perfectly. 
---
I too, think Brody is the one unfinished part of the original story. Even if he becomes a boss in a new Order related questline, we must get a chance to meet him.
---
Also, with all the recent npc's to arrive in Appalachia, there's no shortage of candidates for a new Order. Daguerre, Jen, Weasel, maybe some new ones brought on when the BoS arrives, so many candidates. Then you can rebuild your base and see it develop, something like what Suikoden did with their fortresses.
---
LOL well, pvp on those games then...  
---
mmo pvp lmfao....
---
Get a full set of Vanguard's SS and look for Instigating weapons. The Instigating Gauss Shotty is OP when it works. Gauss Minigun is next. Welcome back to the world of the living!
---
Thanks man!
---
Feel the same way too...back to grinding for lead and steel...lucky it‚Äôs just that..lol
---
&gt; It is a world boss, not a random 3 star legendary.
---
Does it at least give appropriate rewards? Like, 4 or 5 star legendaries?
---
209 check and 5k value not bad for a 2 star that i almost scriped was hoping for a 10k peace tho
---
Yep, even same scope. The only difference is that one has "33% more vats accuracy", but even from blank shots, against enemies that are meele attacking me, the damages are different
---
I'm confused. You're saying to ignore the timer and just loot everything, but I'd need to adhere to the timer in order to get to the end crate to loot it as well. It sounds like you're saying I get the loot in the crate even if I don't loot it. Is that what you're saying?
---
Only works in vats
---
Edit : Oops wrong one hold one
---
Edit 2: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nWiS2vP65_o
---
There is another video of this glitch from a different guy can‚Äôt find it.
---
I am also really enjoying this but I wish the cursed weapons were more then just a shovel, pickaxe , and harpoon gun
---
More of a pain in the ass than anything. Everytime I try to join it bugs out. Still not been able to do the event.... Oh well I guess right? ü§£
---
This encourages the wrong play style no matter what. People don't have time to play, sure. But they have time to turn on the game, sit down and walk away, putting strain on the servers and making the whole game look unpopulated because everyone's just sitting there, farming atoms.
---
Challenges need to encourage play style that fits the game.
---
While fixing the exploits and nerfing dmg all around...
---
You then take the skin of said ex-dad and make a rug out of it.
---
Try the fo76 market reddit someone might be interested
---
That is strange, I have no idea why is it different sorry
---
Idk, bc its not a single player game like every other fallout? Was never marketed or promised that it would be a single player game. All they said was you could play it solo if you wanted, which you can, and is totally different from a ‚Äúsingle player game‚Äù. Nobody is forcing you to play this. For the same reason some fans of elder scrolls dont play ESO and just wait for TES:VI you dont have to play this and can just wait for fallout 5. Its not like the market doesnt have plenty of other good lengthy single player rpgs that can feel the void while u wait.
---
NP, ty
---
It's so weird. Every Fallout is "war never changes and it always sucks" but FO76 is "Nukes are bad, but you're the player, and you have irradiated flowers to pick"
---
But it should work, right?
---
Workaround options are; private server or keep trying public and server hopping til you get lucky.
---
Good luck!
---
You need to buy 5 plans in total right (excl. helmet)? So left arm, right arm, torso, left leg and right leg?
---
Platform?
---
Pacifist doesn't turn off workshop PvP.
---
I do have Fallout 1st. It's not showing up under Apparel.
---
Where does it say this? Need to read this.
---
Hohoho sir you just gave me the best news I've heard all week
---
The problem with explosive combat shotguns is that they are close range, so you do yourself damage when using them.
---
Bashing also always worked with these challenges. No need to waste ammo on those combat challenges. Hint: try to clear that list before One Wasteland goes live, as you will need a lot more effort for them once there's no more low-level cannonfodder robots or creatures for your higher level characters.
---
Not to mention Maggie looks like the long lost sister of Duchess.
---
Oh, so legacy weapons will solve the problem? That's nice, good thing they are so readily available. -.-
---
Speaking of which - Prime Recievers should change the look of the gun (add some Ultracite green wires or little crystals peppered around?)
---
Check the workshops in front of the power plants.  Often, people will leave the Fusion Core generators unlocked, or there will still be one operational from where the owner left the server.  If you do that power plant's "Powering Up" mission, or can make a fusion generator, you can power the Fusion Core Generator yourself.
---
Player vendors will often sell them for 1c per percentage remaining, so 100c for a full Core.  
---
If you find Fusion Generators while adventuring, they might have a high-percentage core in them.
---
They are rarely awarded for high-level events.
---
Could play it solo.
---
Not "It's a traditional Fallout single player experience"
---
Very different things.
---
my problem is more that it doesn't do damages to enemy XD
---
Can't tell me what to do, I'm a rebel without a cause
---
Got tired of never getting it so I had to make one IRL.
---
50 cal. But my Vampire Gatling Plasma saved my bacon fighting the Colossus.
---
Behmot can spawn at Whitespring, i found One of level 100
---
What worked for me on pc was quit to desktop, re-enter and go straight to the terminal. Read all entries and then analyze, then put the fuse in. I was able to do that first try after relogging in. 
---
Ive heard to read terminal entries, then fuse, then analyze; but that is what got me stuck in the first place. Tried it the way i said and had no issues
---
76 content tbh, like terminals in the vault had named characters that we just never hear about ever again
---
Your items are garbage
---
I'm convinced there was no previous post.  How deep does this rabbit hole go?!
---
Check if you have equipped a long barrel. If not it won't do a lot of damage.
---
Please don't bring your magic weapon to any public event.
---
why would you scrip that in the first place? Even a 2\* has value nevermind a 3\*
---
good for me then, because I run a garbage build
---
.50 cal is the best heavy. The warm up time on the others make them too frustrating and the .50 cal feels better than the LMG.
---
If most of what we pay for was actually getting funneled back into the games development, I'd agree with both of you. But instead it lines investor pockets :)
---
The crate only gives stims, grenades and some ore, basically worthless. The legendaries, flux and notes you get from completing the event and looting the boss. Haven't tried just accepting death at the end, but if it keeps the junk on you, it's a game changer
---
&gt; I just ran this and to start with, someone nuked my camp while starting the event
---
Were your being an ass or just somehow caught in the crossfire?
---
I saved a lot of weight by holding all of my food and drinks, and chems. The perk Thru-Hiker under Agility (rank 3) reduces the weight by 90% for food and drink, and the perk Travelling Pharmacy under Strength (rank 3) reduces the weight of all chems (including stimpaks) by 90%. Makes a huge difference when I have over 200 stimpaks, loads of purified water etc.
---
Are you using the camo under armor? Been glitched for a while. Swap to the normal and not the camo
---
Just use junk shield, get some use outta that garbage
---
Bro you‚Äôre not gonna get anywhere saying stuff like this here. Anything that‚Äôs pro consumer on this sub and anti Bethesda is immediate down votes. 
---
To those in the comments saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just cosmetic‚Äù it‚Äôs convenient that they forgot about collecting robots( and all the variants) fridges, the unstoppables buff when having a full team wearing them, scrap kits and repair kits, etc. 
---
Bethesda went back on their promise to keeping the atom store cosmetic only. Buts it‚Äôs ok the fanboys in this sub will eat whatever shit Bethesda does. 
---
Let‚Äôs not forget the gameplay advantage from fallout first. Not only are the atom shop items ridiculously priced for example (14-18 dollars USD) for a power armor skin. 
---
But fallout 1st which is 12.99 a month. And for a whole year it‚Äôs 99.99. That‚Äôs more than Xbox live or PSN online costs yearly. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. 
---
The only reason they heavily monetize the living fuck out of this cash cow is that the sales weren‚Äôt to good due to the absolute broken state the game launched in. 
---
I‚Äôve never seen a game that‚Äôs still in such a broken state be some expensive to get items that people should actually want.
---
And I get comments all the time ‚Äúif it‚Äôs so broken don‚Äôt play it stupid??‚Äù 
---
Like damn my bad, it seems I can‚Äôt enjoy a game from one of my favorite game franchises cause some glue eating mouth breathers will suck up all the shit Bethesda throws at them. 
---
Trust me, this sub is brain dead fanboy as it gets.
---
So I finished the quest soon after the patch and it worked fine. I didn‚Äôt find out till later that they didn‚Äôt actually patch it. I‚Äôve seen comments on these posts that one person per server can do it a day (the first person) and that would appear to be the case.
---
Forgiveness
---
Ill try that. Hopefully it works for me too, but glad to hear that you were able to continue
---
I- I‚Äôm a what?
---
I know, sometimes the best sellers are literally right under their noses
---
I had big dumbs
---
There‚Äôs a lot of recommendations for vanguards here, so it‚Äôs worth noting that there‚Äôs an alternative POV that notes that there‚Äôs diminishing returns when it comes to DR above something like 300, and that you get better protection by wearing a mix of enemy specific armor, which provides and across the board reduction in incoming damage. 
---
Personally my only full health toons are berserkers. Armor is for coddled vault types that want their mommy. Go commando, literally.
---
Yeah it's pretty annoying having the event end in 30 seconds
---
Does a private server always work?
---
Report after one wasteland please.
---
In bird language, that's called being a dick
---
How effective is the healing? The few times I‚Äôve tried medic guns I was not impressed with the heal rate.
---
Thats what I mean I have the old bugged and the new one cause I wanted Beckett to wear it with tattered rags. So old buggy is now a legacy.
---
No idea bud, if its not under apparel or fallout 1st menu then maybe bugged i already had it so not showing at all for me except owned in apparel, sorry.
---
I am a non pa heavy gunner. Lots of good info here already so just adding in mine. 
---
&gt; What (if any) are good armor prefixes for high health builds on armor?
---
I use a full vanguard ss set atm. With barbarian in str, I am able to reach about 640dr without chems. 
---
&gt; What's generally good on a shotgun?
---
Shotguns are buggy trash atm, would avoid. If you do use them, use a j/e as it is fun but I messed with it quite a bit and could never get around the hp bug and the uselessness on queen. Switched back to heavy guns. 
---
&gt; The perk "Blocker" is a must have for Bloodied, so is it as beneficial for high health or can I get away with replacing it?
---
Helps but not a dealbreaker. I do not have it.
---
Also dont forget chem perks for doubling chem length and faster stimpak/radaway use they help a lot. Dont need to worry about messing up your addictions as you take 1 every 3/5/10 mins and the duration are doubled. 
---
&gt; but for non PA time what's a good replacement?
---
Don't really need it imo. I used weapon repair for a while which is a huge quality of life buff, but after a while just moved the points to another special to get the chem buff perks.
---
Private servers should be free, scrap box should be free, survival tent should be free. You‚Äôre right but the Bethesda zombies here won‚Äôt want to hear it.
---
The atom shop stopped being ‚Äúonly‚Äù cosmetic a long time ago. Bethesda promised us customers something and they lied. 
---
We are consumers and customers, not children who want to go to Chucky cheese but then are told no.
---
Hard to choose. A min maxer would go strangler heart. Others T 65. 
---
If the damage reduction happens from pts. The poison would be even more helpful as long as it‚Äôs dps stays the same.
---
I went with T-65 and the only complaint I got is there are no head lamps for it. I miss my bright head light.
---
In a terminal of Vault 51 it's written that are passed 6 years and in this time all Apalacchia Is burning for the nukes launched from player but this isn't canonical, we can find some information of nuclear Winter in morgantown and near Vault 76 in 2102
---
DPS wise 25% faster fire rate is way better than explosive because it means you‚Äôll be doing more damage overall. While many people dislike explosive (espically for commando) I still find it useful for commando because AoE damage is pretty handy in events and group situations, makes tagging enemies easier so you can get most of the loot. 
---
If you care about maximizing your damage input, then go for J2525 because it‚Äôs actually better than JE25. But if you find yourself doing group events often then explosive helps out a ton.
---
My good friend had me borrow his B2525 fixer and I used it for a while and it was pretty great, and yesterday I managed to roll a B25250 fixer that I traded for a BE25 fixer and so far I like the BE25 more than the B2525

Reddit - fo76 - Stash Management Tips? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bce5f4/stash_management_tips/
---
The first comment in this thread has some good tips.
---
*Sirens heard in the distance* Well not for long but still
---
There‚Äôs at least 3 Motherlode units.
---
Best Idea I saw proposed was that we just upload the ammo we got and it automatically converts it to the points we have to work with.
---
Then just buy based on the available currency.
---
I keep trying to give stuff to players newer than me to pay forward the help I got and none of them ever take it :(
---
AFAIK yes, but I haven‚Äôt done that myself.
---
Bethesda also describe the atom shop to be ‚Äúonly cosmetic‚Äù as well. See? I can play that game too.
---
Playing through FO3 right now and you‚Äôre 100% right.
---
Can't wait for Beat My Meat Week.
---
And/or stick his head(s) on spikes in the middle of your room with a nice little label on it with his name. Talk about grotesque...
---
Pretty sure those were either a NW or atomic shop item
---
In my language, it's called fuk u I do what I want I outta control, all of it is my exp
---
It's a fairly simple template with them.
---
If you have a problem it either (a) doesn't exist or (2) isn't a big deal with an easy workaround.
---
If you're not happy with a gameplay change, it doesn't bother them at all and you're the problem.
---
If a game system is punishing (such as the various grinds), they will utilize a false equivalency to claim that \*ALL\* MMOs do this... despite Fallout 76 not being anything like a true MMO.
---
Oh and ~~Wastelanders~~ One Appalachia will fix all of this and then you'll see! You'll all see!
---
Bad writing.
---
Hmm im gonna say something that sounds really weird. 
---
But i had 2 similar lever action rifles. 
---
One with 33% hit chance and one without. 
---
I figured they should do the same amount of damage ofc. 
---
But after testing on some super mutants I found the one with the 33% effect actually did more damage..? 
---
Idk for sure but it really does sound like what‚Äôs happening here as well. At least this post made me even more sure I wasn‚Äôt hallucinating lol.
---
Edit: like you mentioned in another comment about the 33% effect just to be clear
---
It shoots two bullets, each at 62.5% of damage. Because of terrible accuracy, yes it can end up doing less damage.
---
I use an addon to hide it
---
Pretty sure its just the cherry on top for when you're done with the SS armor, I bought it just to have the complete look, also protects against airborne hazards so it isnt 100% worthless....only 99%.
---
Lol literally the moment I post this, the tracker updates.
---
I think they chose to use the current interface as a way to prevent duping. The vendor style UI is what has been responsible for the majority of dupes.
---
My exact same experience.
---
I played cod and destiny in the past and I was not that bad.
---
But here? Holy shit!
---
I did NW yesterday to find out but I haven't played NW in so long  I forgot where to find the rewards.  I already checked the atomic shop, couldn't find it.
---
Watch out we got a badass over here
---
Hi men, I think I see you today in My team doing the event
---
I find evil that the Vault Dwellers and Maggie are the real origin of the colossus this because Earle Williams survived until the Great War and then for cannibalism and Radiation he become a wendigo. Then when we nuke the mine and the Radiation transform him into a Monster.
---
it's easy to say this, but i'm enjoying a colossal problem and look forward to meat week. It's just nice not to have to worry about challenges for a bit, but it'd be nicer to get something for the ones that i happen to complete.
---
According to Angry Turtle‚Äôs recent video on shotguns mods, negative range causes a huge drop in damage, around 90%.
---
You talking about a single bulb? Or Christmas lights? The single bulb style is a random camp plan you can get from defending workshops. The string Christmas lights, red and white lights, vault blue and yellow, and white string lights were all atom shop and are currently unavailable.
---
Watch out we got a salty reddiboy over here
---
Ok, so basically that 33% make, in some way, the weapon stronger. With the shotgun it can be said that it make the bullet spread less, so all of the bullets of the rose they hit the head.
---
If you are on PS4 I have one I'm willing to trade
---
LMG except for its ammo usage. It‚Äôs a nice change from a common heavy weapon since it doesn‚Äôt slow you down and take a awhile to bring your weapon back up after a stagger.
---
Yeah it makes more sense on shotguns I guess. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs intentional at all. 
---
How much better did the weapon become for you? Just to hear.
---
The single hanging light.
---
Explosive for rando mobs, faster fire rate for scorchbeast queen.
---
You can do that, at least my game let's me
---
Then Ill just ask some disvord folks. Thanks for the advice
---
I find it easiest to just pretend like we never got an ammo converter.
---
Oh no you called me a redditboy :( Lmao
---
I see what the problem is. You should have hung it in front of your wall paper, not behind it.
---
LMK if I can be of help in future posts!
---
Only in ADS. I can still 1 shot everything in vats. ADS takes half a drum mag from 5 feet away and does basically no damage.
---
I grinded and traded for it, I will do as I damn well please.
---
If you don't like it, do the events in a private server.
---
Your shots have always blown me away! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I have all the Christmas  and vault tec  lights
---
I‚Äôm keeping all the weapons I‚Äôm using to level up and when I can make the jump from the junk I made do with (it‚Äôs not terrible but it ain‚Äôt great either, stuff like BoS recon rifles and non legendary fixers plus a level 5 furious hunting rifle) to god rolled endgame weapons and armor. I‚Äôm not using any form of armor at all. Easier to sneak that way.
---
What's the problem? Did you forget the name? You could have saved the last 15 minute played and se how he was called.
---
Angry turtle had clarified that they don‚Äôt have to be a fire rate over 200, just fast firing weapons heavy weapons. My lmg with bash damage only has 158(or 150 something) and it is still definitely ‚Äúmagic‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm on a new character, level 34. Went up 28 ranks just playing, not even trying to do the goals.
---
It would make the gauss mini gun even more OP.
---
The two shot Combat with 33% one shot almost every normal enemy. The two shot with explosive, not even one shot level 30 enemies
---
Years of market research has said you‚Äôre wrong, but go ahead, pretend like you know everything and talk out of your ass.
---
What a no brainer. You activate the converter, a window with two panes shows up, on the left is the list of all the ammo you have, on the right is the list of ammo you "buy". Each have a price per item and you just buy and sell using a currency like scrip or caps. Item quantity is varied through the horizontal scroll bar.
---
Wtf Bethesda, you need to educate your developers a little. You've got all the code already there, clearly it was extensible enough to be used for the scrip machine and the Purveyor. Instead, this has dragged on for two months and wasted way more time for the devs *and* the players.
---
I have a magic weapon. There are 2 reason to use.
---
1 someone is about to die
---
2 event will fail. I refuse to use otherwise.
---
Use a magic shotgun. I have a shotgun build. If the queen lands even once, I can easily reach the damage threshold for loot. I only get no loot if someone melts her in seconds. I also never shoot her while she‚Äôs flying because I essentially do no damage and I don‚Äôt want to stagger her and prevent her from landing.
---
WE DID IT!! GET 'EM OUT, BOYS!!!
---
This happens in Destiny 2 as well. Pretty sure it‚Äôs a server issue. You do so much damage so fast it basically can‚Äôt keep up.
---
Yeah, the problem here is that a two shot without explosive does tons of damage more. If the spread of the hits is the problem, why without explosive it does damages normally?
---
Yeah okay. 
---
I did around 80-100 more damage on enemies with that effect on. 
---
I‚Äôm confused lol
---
No I called you a reddiboy, like reddiWhip
---
I have way worse delays sometimes from Germany.
---
That character was supposed to be a ‚Äúnoob player‚Äù in Bethesda‚Äôs most recent trailer. I forget what it was advertising, maybe one wasteland or public teams. Long story short, it‚Äôs just a player model character that ends up running behind a player in full PA to hide from some mobs. He then gives the peace sign *seen above* as a taunt towards the mobs who then get annihilated by the stronger PA player.
---
So most likely there isn‚Äôt any connection at all besides that someone likes the BoS anchorage cut and facial hairü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah, more or less the same
---
It's already impossible to change jetpack skins on legacy non-torso jetpacks, adding a cosmetic only slot to a torso piece shouldn't affect those.
---
*Shouldn't.* We are still talking about Bethesda here.
---
But they never listen to me for some reason :(
---
I am still waiting for the Fisto collectron skin that collects oil, handcuffs, prison collars, and fertilizer...
---
Then maybe, just maybe, I think we found the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù.
---
Two shot explosives are so nerfed that I wouldn't be surprise if they made less damage than a two shot or explosive shotgun. I had one a month ago and I sold it because It harmed me more than the enemies
---
Just noticed it.
---
Sad how people think its a favor get a fair ammount of atoms in a full price game in some cosmetic items that should be unlockable doing quests or in some hidden parts of the game as a secret reward.
---
People are more interested in bethesda profits , instead the consumer welfare.
---
I went with T65, partly because I didn‚Äôt want to hassle grinding for vault steel on top of everything else. T65 is proving very sturdy, takes beating after beating without needing repair. Happy customer.
---
Mhm I should probably stop arguing with a 14 year old, but this is kinda amusing me
---
Good point about the damage reduction. Been trying to decide between those two sets as well and that might be the deciding factor.
---
How on earth did you kill Earle in under 15 seconds? Not calling you a list. I'm just not understanding how that is even possible.
---
Reddit
---
Angry turtle,
---
Juice head. And some random ones I feel like clicking.
---
Ofc reddit as well, but, I don‚Äôt take all news here as serious unless there‚Äôs sources.
---
Is crystal clear that they don't know **how to** a lot of things in regards to enjoyable content. Just take a look at the wasted Watoga Arena. Or the unused Commie Undeground Amazing Glowing Station.
---
There's a chest??
---
It‚Äôs not possible unless you have a half or full wall stacked on top of the lower walls you‚Äôre encasing the stairs in. If you wanted to put a roof over them the game would thing that the stairs are intersecting with the roof piece.
---
Done lights colors can be controlled by the terminal
---
What can you do with excess TD? You get 1 and it starts the quest, you can only turn 1 in. Am I missing something?
---
I like most of them, besides some of the useless ones like the broadsider.  My goto is usually my ultracite gatling laser or just a gat laser. I have cores for days and enjoy the extremely high accuracy, throwing out 1000 rounds before needing to reload is quite nice.
---
The downsides, being spinup and loading partially used cores can be annoying, but doesnt get me killed.
---
I also carry 1 of everything to keep it fresh
---
So crazy it's so realistic...
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have investors. It‚Äôs a subsidiary of a privately owned company, meaning the only way they can succeed is by putting cash back into the business.
---
You know I've had this happen once on my low lvl, one that I use to get the lvl up challanges done easier, but lately everytime I try to either do events or even just my own quests I find high lvls that keep trying to fight me. I eve had one try to capture the workshop I was in just so he could pvp me. So it's sadly not really one sided on this.
---
On PS4, btw.
---
Oh man, I'm always missing the obvious! What would I do if not for you, kind stranger! ü§£
---
Really.  Any terminal or a special one.
---
LMG, but I use a .50 most of the time because of ammo.
---
I'd rather donat aid and resources to a noob that bloody Atlas
---
 Same.
---
There so many bugs on Xbox. 
---
Like 4 different respawn glitches.
---
I get stuck emojing unless I'm killed by something.
---
Die from eating food when my well fed wears off, even tho I have plenty of room for the rads from the food.
---
Crashes galore.
---
Sometimes when I equip two weapons and try to switch to the other it never pulls it out, and I can't switch back to the first weapon. I then  have to keep equipping and unequipping stuff to get it to work.
---
That's all I can think of for now, but there is plenty more.
---
What does magic weapon mean indeed?
---
Problem with medics on many heavy guns is they mostly suck in VATs do to high AP consumption.
---
23 actually my dude. Ign Nekrosias. Add me so you can watch me use magic weapons on all your events. Hear me laugh as I collect salt
---
Is it not? There aren‚Äôt any P2W mechanics associated with it and the handful of items that can help gameplay are useless like the camp fridge, what do you have to be upset about besides poorly tested skins?
---
If you run mutations and play on a team where everyone is using the mutation boost perk for being on a team it could give you massive boosts.
---
Wait, there‚Äôs a Fallout 76 Sub-Reddit?
---
Oh that's pretty cool, I never realized that's what berry mentats did as I rarely use chems
---
news releases, ITVs and patch notes
---
"And it was fun!  I'm going to kill him at least three more times tomorrow!"
---
It's a reference to Pulp Fiction.
---
Yeah, I know that...
---
are you sorting by "new"?
---
My biggest grief with it is the way that the selection bar jumps about, why can't it just remember the last 3 selections until you change it..the largest purchase is next the the smallest sale , and man it sucks ass when after 10 minutes of clicking you suddenly purchase 10,000 rounds of what you don't want üò†
---
‚Äúno.‚Äù
---
When I recorded it wasn't even that bad, usually it's much worse here, but I certainly can imagine how it can be ecen worse in other regions.
---
This is a true fallout dialog choice
---
They are really good! This Colossus is the stuff of nightmares!
---
Okay now its getting cringy
---
Hoo boy, guessing you weren't around in the olden days when we had a measly 400 lbs to work with.
---
I dont care about those. Unless im putting up 4kcaps. Im just trying to start small. But perks dont matter
---
If you're the only one there with one then you control the event, no one can stop your farming and you don't need to worry about the timer. Strangely I rarely run into people using them.
---
Fallout 76 community could be One of the best community in videogame
---
What exactly is a magic weapon?

P2W? Technically no not that I‚Äôm aware. Pay for a advantage? Absolutely. 
---
Fallout 1st comes with two massive gameplay altering features. The scrap box and survival tent. The scrap box is a massive gameplay advantage, the survival tent is a Advanatge. 
---
Atom shop game okay advantages? All the collecting robots to gather anything from junk or chems whatever. Repair kits and scrap kits can also be bought for an advantage. 
---
Are some of these big advantages and some small? Yes, but Are they advantages for paying money after paying full price for a game? Yes.
---
How? Magic gun? I can tell you that my usual 1\* bloodied plasma gatling did diddly squat when I tried to solo.
---
Says the guy getting downvoted to the basement of hell.
---
I will use my JE LMG if nobody else is doing damage and we aren't making progress, but only once the event is getting towards the end. 
---
I've done 2 runs so far, and now have over 600 screws.. feels good.
---
Ok. I understand now. Thank you for explaining. That actually changes things for the better. I was stressing that aspect of the event a bit, but now I know I can slow down and just loot baby! üòÅ
---
Ive been having so much fun with my glitched ammo factory camp i never even bother re-placing the ammo converter post "fix"
---
Woopsie is an urban legend man
---
"Magic" Junkie's Explosive minigun with the right mods, perks, and method.
---
For the love of pete, just let me sell bullets, and/or give the converter a sliding scale. I spent 30min yesterday trying to convert bullets because my carry and camp weight keep maxing out and I STILL have have random handfuls of ammo I can't convert.
---
5k was a ripoff even before the dupe, it dropped a lot at last year's Halloween event.
---
Pretty much magic weapons are guns that have a certain legendary effect that make the weapon  stupidly stronger. They do more damage than some legacies
---
"You're welcome, just trying to save you from yourself." - Bethesda
---
This happens to me rarely when I‚Äôm in a bad server. 
---
Also run into mobs that sit there and act like training dummies.
---
2 years since the game released and still no fucking text chat. Why!
---
This reminds me of Witcher 3 with level scaling enabled (which turns basic rats into one of the most fearsome enemies in the game).
---
Junkies is about to be nerfed into the ground
---
Only time I ever break it out is if the event is almost over and we need to make it up. Second queen run on Xbox last night she wouldn‚Äôt land so we had 3 minutes left so I broke the big boy out. So nice to have during those situations
---
Hey guys.   I know it's not South America, but I'm in Costa Rica (Central America) and I don't usually have huge latency issues.  I use a VPN and route through Florida most of the time.
---
I usually only have problems with the provider here when the power goes out.
---
Yeah man, trust me only reason I even say anything like this in this sub is that I don‚Äôt care if I get down voted.
---
I was always told by other fallout sub re-edits to not come here saying the things I say cause they won‚Äôt listen to jack shit.
---
The 33% vats chance is a magic weapon modifier. It works differently for shotguns than on heavy weapons. Check out Angry Turtle's youtube video.
---
How are you connected to your WiFi? Before I got an Ethernet lead my PS4 would disconnect that often from the wifi making anything online a game of chance. Granted I use a tplink due to the wifi being terrible in my room as the router is downstairs so it was easy to plug in an ethernet
---
If OP put this post on some kind of sex meet up site it would have a whole other meaning.
---
Thanks but what legendary effects indeed?
---
Agreed. Sometimes i only have 1-2k ammo (honestly i use my ammo supply to enforce the behavior) however nothing beats that "whelp, mans gotta do what a man's gotta do" feeling :p
---
he gimme da watch......and now, little maggie, i give the watch to you.
---
Naw man!! I had it once! Worst day of my life! Everything went wrong.
---
For example limb damage. I believe junkies. Angryturtle has a video and he'll tell you all of them
---
Just look up fallout 76 magic weapons
---
This is the right answer
---
Imagine taking virtual internet points seriously
---
You caught us. We love it when other companies make money off us. It‚Äôs a kink.
---
orrr we just realize that hiring staff, paying for servers, and everyday upkeep and maintenance of a 500 person studio which is a subsidiary of a 250 person studio which is a subsidiary of another studio costs a lot and getting every piece of content for free doesn‚Äôt make sense.
---
I‚Äôm pissed with Bethesda on a regular basis for a lot of their broken content, but people downvoted this because you‚Äôre asking a company to lose money so you can have unnecessary cosmetics.
---
We are on reddit, all I'mma base this convo on is internet things, based on those, seems like the internet agrees I can use my magic weapons.
---
This made my day
---
I buy alot of weapons just to scrip....i pay 15 - 20 caps a scrip.  A 3 star weapon is worth 600-800 to me.
---
Use fed76.info some weapons and armor are worth 100k caps the site will give you a good ballpark of what its worth
---
Not necessarily. It would depend on how fast it makes each round. I used to run the minigun and it eats ammo like crazy.
---
Tbh that‚Äôs my least favorite thing from fo76 lore wise
---
Because Bethesda forces us to buy a subscription to get out of their bullshit excuses why the stash space is so low.
---
It honestly might be the 'bag' skin you use. I used to have that problem alot with the default paper bag. It blended with the ground so people would not notice it. Lately, I transitioned to using the new bright blue (noncanvas) vault bag. People have been able to notice it more quickly - although it does take them a bit of time trying to loot it.
---
I have an Ally mission right now to kill the Flatswoods monster. Maybe that is why?
---
The SS helmet is the same as a gas mask. I bought it because it looks cool &amp; quite honestly, I had nothing else to spend my gold on (and I still have over 1000 treasury notes).
---
While the SS armor has great rad resist, it can't compete with PA or especially a hazmat suit / CSA.
---
Sad times.
---
See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
This happens to everyone sometimes enemies just decide to not take damage because the game still has this problem from BETA
---
Saying that we want ‚Äúunnecessary cosmetics‚Äù proves you haven‚Äôt read a single thing any of us have said. So why comment at all?
---
Oh no you don‚Äôt have to do that. I‚Äôll do that for you. It really should be me I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for them to do that to you
---
Angry Turtle (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs) has said that medic's isn't working for him of late, so you may not have missed out of much.
---
T-65.
---
I prefer the look (though some people say its ugly) &amp; the helmet comes with all the mods already.
---
I keep the Final Word machine gun from Beckett in my stash just for the SBQ. It works great for the longer distance shooting. I‚Äôm not even a heavy gunner and never had trouble.
---
I‚Äôve had a somewhat similar problem where seemingly random enemies undergo the legendary mutation, but the name doesn‚Äôt say legendary, nor do they drop any legendary loot.
---
I use the fed76 site. I like selling super cheap though, to keep things moving. So I'll take their lowest listed price, and sell it for half that. Armor probably still sells, but with secret service being the go to, I don't even bother with it.
---
I've tried it with the sbq and it did barely any dmg?
---
Am I allowed to target specific limbs in vats or does that ruin the effect?
---
I have actually saved so much 5mm up being I only use when big boy needs to lay the law down. I think I had 20k for it. But after two nukes and 3 colossus in the grove I am down to 4k. But yeah that feeling when you gotta say yup daddy‚Äôs coming and you see the health bar just go from red to grey so quick. Best feeling. But I‚Äôm sure Bethesda will fix this soon being no one wants it fixed
---
dont join the fallout 76 trading hub, gandalf will ban you for cussing at him in DM's (which is against their server rules, but he's a boomer, so he did it anyways)
---
I mean I was just asking nicely, but you had to start acting like a little kid on the spectrum
---
A weapon that will produce a massively increased amount of damage after consecutive shots to the same body part. You can literally delete an SBQ in two seconds with a particularly bugged magic weapon.
---
Definitely had that second one, but only ever with Scorched. Made for a relief at low levels sometimes.
---
I did T-65 first then I‚Äôm working on Strangler Heart. I decided on T-65 first because I‚Äôve heard that the poison/acid damage is super needed into the ground. As in it does like 10 damage a sec but you have to be basically on top of them. 
---
Someone who has it can probably tell you more. But most PA only differ minutely so at least SH has an unique effect
---
I‚Äôm loving my two-shot gauss riffle
---
Correct - don't use the one you get from the Atom Shop.
---
I was just replying in my typical fashion my dude. Don't take it personally. On fallout I'm always like this.
---
So many people misquote what they said to say this, so here's the actual quote as said by Pete Hines:
---
‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76‚Äìall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff‚Äìis going to be free. That‚Äôs important. **And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff**. To make sure folks understand‚Äìlook there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. **That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free**. That feels right.‚Äù   
---
Even thought this is also taken out of context and more is said in the source link [here](https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/) where Pete Hines clarifies his use of  "cosmetic" as something that provides no competitive advantage over other players.   
---
Let's break it down.
---
**Atomic shop IS cosmetic stuff**. Not WILL ALWAYS BE, but IS at the moment that statement was made. There's no promise there of Atomic Shop staying cosmetic only in the future. Only promise is at the end where all new content is to be free in the future, but it does not refer to the Atomic shop in any way.
---
Not trying to defend their actions on se of these points, but this is a fact that constantly gets misquoted to say that there were claims that were never made in the first place.
---
As for advantages, ok, the subscription is a clear advantage. Tent and scrap box are key. I haven't renewed this month and it's been a bit more annoying to play and manage space.
---
The repair kits are trash and better ones can be obtained for free from Scorched Earth. The Shop ones are not an advantage over those in any way as they provide less repair.
---
The collectrons are hardly an advantage. Having a bot that brings me a plunger and some trash communist posters every 20 minutes is hardly an advantage when I can gather disproportionately more junk by just going around places. If anything, I'm likely to remove mine because I'm getting sick of repetitive lines. 
---
Lastly, the scrap kits. I got 20+ from legendary run and haven't used a single one. Can't say if they are an advantage in any way to be honest as when I'm full, I don't just need my stuff scrapped and put away, but I need to get other stuff done like repairs and more food/water so I go back to my camp anyways.
---
Edit: 1 more thing that I do believe is advantegous is the fridge. I prefer to stock it up with Cranberry Relish occasionally than continuously harvesting and cooking it. Advantageous? Sure. But also punishing as fuck to your camp budget.
---
&gt; I've always figured their rationale was that if it didn't benefit all platforms, they didn't want to bother with it.
---
What sorta bullshit?
---
Is easy kill he in a moment, is true I us√© a full uny/STR/cavalier mixed set ss and Scout and bss STR deathckaw. 
---
Whith foods, drugs and alcohol I dont need much to kill him
---
Only one advice, dont Go  with higt radiation, and When you kill him restore your heatlh full
---
You get scrap kits for free by playing legendary run(still have 20) and repair kits for killing SBQ(lowest I‚Äôve had of those in awhile is 30). I feel bad for anyone wasting so many atoms on those. They‚Äôre getting ripped off. The tent is nice but long term not very necessary as caps are useless after 120-50 for fast travel. Scrap kit is an advantage, sure. But paying $100/yr for it? I just don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs such a big deal when you could have a WoW membership for that same value. 
---
Very few ppl just spend $60 anymore for a game. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs dlc, transaction, etc. it stinks, but I‚Äôve only bought the base game and yet still get dlc for free. If some ppl wanna buy a scrapbox so I can get free content then thank you and enjoy!
---
I‚Äôm having the same issue, I‚Äôve gone to hornwright, found the keycard but cannot actually pick it up...
---
The Poison/Acid doesn't work correctly on Strangler to the point of doing 1 damage per second to enemies, and since it uses Ultracite PA Mods, it ALSO doesn't have headlamps.
---
At this point the advantages are:
---
* T-65 Power Armor: High Radiation Resistance. Highest Damage/Energy Resistance of all Power Armor. Mod plans can be bought (for bullion) but have a fixed location to obtain.
---
* Strangler: High Damage/Energy Resistance. Highest Radiation Resistance of all Power Armor. Mod plans can only be randomly obtained from Scorchbeasts/Scorchbeast Queens.
---
Keep in mind, Power Armor already has a built in Radiation reduction effect, so higher values have diminishing results.
---
I logged on and the first thing I did was go into the nuke silo, and I was still in there when my camp got nuked,its incredibly easy to avoid my camp as well because I avoided my camp and still got monogah mine after I'd finished the silo.
---
I mean there‚Äôs also the run and gun perk and run fast at extra ap cost and marathoner to kinda counteract that and action boy and with unyielding armour to increase your agility and a bunch of other crap yeah you could definitely just out run everyone
---
The SSA is useless w/o chems in a zone, no matter the mod you push on there.
---
The SSA-helmet protects against air born diseases, the CSA-helmet says it protects against air &amp; water born diseases, but the water part is a lie.
---
As for the legendary perk, the complete armor does not include the helmet, so you are free to use whatever you want in that case.
---
invalid link
---
I've found magic shotguns still don't do amazing damage against high health, boss-type enemies but you will one shot every mob in the game. Heck, I have a supposedly "magic" Minigun that doesn't seem to do anything against the SBQ.
---
Oh yeah, ran straight into that on the PTS. I have never pointed my back at that thing again.  
---
Earle doesn't scare me, the Wendigo don't scare me, but that drill? I'm watchin' you!  
---
But yeah, honestly, this is the most real I've had in weeks. Gives me a reason to hunt cards again.
---
Hello. If they're only good for scrip I am personally happy to pay 10-15 caps per 1 point of scrip. EG. A 1* weapon would be 50-75 caps. If they're a more desirable weapon on have more desirable traits then you can get a fair bit more. The most I've ever gotten was 12K but that was for something that i now realise should've been traded, not sold out my machine. Most of the time I rarely get a sale for anything over ~3K. The Fed76 website is super useful, but it's still just a guide. Ultimately you still need to get lucky to have someone turn up and want to buy whatever you're selling. Equally what's only worth scrip to one person could be an amazing roll for another.

Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years.
---
I don't want every legendary into my inventory.  
---
Check out how Borderlands 3 manages this
---
I don't even know where the loot chest spawns lol
---
Gotcha. Thanks for the detail. Thatttttt sucks.
---
Go the the main single bulb in workshop mode and go right. I think it's called Cycle Lights. Not sure if you need a plan or not. It needs a wire per bulb from your power grid, and once installed, exit out of workshop mode and go click on it. It'll cycle through various colours in bright-medium-dim modes, just stop when you've got the setting you want.
---
I knew about the head light but that was my complaint about T65 specifically.
---
Didn‚Äôt know the acid wasn‚Äôt working that well but I always hear min maxers recommending the strangler heart just because of the acid damage.
---
This. You could have stronger shotgun "on paper", but one that has now popular "magic" effect will be stronger always. In V.A.T.S. specially.
---
The ppl answering tickets aren't the same ppl developing the game.
---
It's a minimum wage peon that can't really help much
---
Yeah it has 4 effects like the fixer and one of them is boodied. Where did this come from
---
There ia a FB group that is growing by leaps and bounds called: Queens and Things. All about nukes and events. Not your friends list but a great resource and group . Helps at those events and nukes.
---
&gt; Why would you want it?
---
Because most other MMOs have it? Hell SWTOR has a older engine and it has text chat.
---
&gt;Speaking is preferable to typing.
---
*Looks at mute people*
---
We‚Äôve all given you both reasons why the game is built the way it is. Why do you continue to argue when your only stance has been wanting more free things at Bethesda‚Äôs expense? 
---
It‚Äôs not P2W like most games with memberships and the advantages just simplifies mechanics, it doesn‚Äôt change the difficulty or keep players from being stronger than a paying player. So why are you still arguing when there are people paying $100+ a year so you can have free content?
---
People downvoting someone saying to report exploiters... some real toxicity in some of the community. Jokes on the exploiters though if they end up having their characters wiped and lose progress over just ammo; real pathetic way to go out lmao.
---
Adding the BoS into FO76 is literally the Fallout equivalent of dropping Wolverine into any movie involving the X-Men. 
---
They're the marquee name, and producers figure that it'll get eyeballs, clicks, and downloads from people who like the power armor visuals and the people who stomp around in them.
---
&gt; Probably immersion breaking.
---
And voice chat isn't?
---
That's because it was a beta item. Sucks though, I refunded mine for atoms and I wish I hadn't made that decision
---
It'll calm down, if it hasn't already. Kid &amp; wife were playing the whole day and only saw the Fissure Prime being targeted, not monongah.
---
I'll also not drop another nuke on monongah, maybe when my kid needs the Quest finished. But other places are much more fun and more sensible to nuke.
---
It‚Äôs like Aussie weapons and unusual hats in TF2; it‚Äôs just there to say ‚Äúlook at me and what I have‚Äù. That‚Äôs all.
---
Oh ok. I know exactly what you're talking about.  I had no idea you could do that.  Thank you very much for your help.
---
you may have seen me because at the very moment i posted this i did like 4 runs on a row.
---
you could add me to keep track ;)
---
4 caps? I thought they sell the good stuff in double digit values lol
---
You can target limbs as well, a bloodied gauss shotgun can nearly kill her in one clip with headshots
---
Ok so the mechanics work like this. 1 TD gets you a dice roll for all the things obtainable thru this quest. So you get a shot at BoS PA paint plans, some uncommon BoS outfits, but mostly end up with 2mm, purified water, and some caps. Turning in more doesn‚Äôt get you better rolls but only more caps and that caps at 4 TD plans.
---
I grab a plan and turn it in. Then head back to the WS for another, and when I have depleted all the TD there I hop to another server and check all the other desks that I didn‚Äôt already loot from.
---
Or you could have gone slower and not grind to finish so fast. Then you would still have something to do today. 
---
Plus. With the people who finished the run in like 24-48hrs it would not be fair to support actions that may be wrong. And if you say we‚Äôll make a cut off...say 14 days...who is to say that was done legitimately? So what about 30 days? Same thing applies. 
---
The legendary run was an extra added to the game and once complete, your done. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Juice head? I vaguely remember him doing FO4 mods didn't know he was covering this game I'll check it out!
---
Oh so only magic weapons like Lmg and similar do godlike dmg against sbq and wendigo colossus? Well thats disappointed
---
Yeah,  and groups in those games use 3rd party voice comms because it's better than typing.
---
That‚Äôs ridiculous!
---
Hmm ok I'll check it out
---
You have to be close enough for all of the pellets to hit, you cant sit back and snipe with it.
---
Bats and Cargo Bots are the achilles heel of magic shotties. Once they land or are slowed you can obliterate them. But you will likely want to carry something else with better ranged application in order to *get* them to land. My stealth shotgunner carries an explosive handmade for this purpose.
---
Small price to pay for being able to oneshot L90 glowing deathclaws or twoshot L95 ancient behemoths.
---
I would like to offer a counterpoint. I very much care about combat mechanics and I would prefer everyone has an ok looking costume over terribly boring gameplay
---
There's a crate with loot at the end? Huh I haven't noticed nor knew about it
---
Yeah I like having my camp in the forest, so occasionally I'll get a low level or two stop by. I'll usually drop them whatever a couple of legendaries I have waiting go be scrapped and ammo I don't plan on using, maybe some booze too if I've been brewing.
---
What games i dont play battle royale lol.
---
rng pvp lmfao
---
Well, I would not call it a *total* loss... anytime you are in danger and would have normally used a railway spike, pop a flare instead and I will come help you :)
---
Glad you like it! Even the bits between songs are spot on.
---
On heavy weapons, to get the full effect the weapon must reach 200 rounds per minute
---
Mistery solved: the non explosive one, thanks to the 33% accuracy, does tons of random damages. If they fix the "magic", the explosive would be far better
---
It's not quite good vs Queen, especially when she's flying. On ground it does okay, and then you can easily do enough damage to get loot. Couple of close shots with my shotgun while she's on the ground, and I can turn to killing adds, while people chip her hp down.
---
As ZAX wills it, so it must be done. HAIL ZAX
---
I mean I was directly beneath hear and had a 95% chance of hiting everything on her. So I dont think that the distance was the problem
---
There‚Äôs really no reason to argue. Typing a whole essay wouldn‚Äôt change the mind of a die hard consumer. 
---
There would be no reason for players paying $100 if Bethesda were pro consumer. They aren‚Äôt. Some games have launched in horrible states and ended being loved with all the works they out into it without fucking the wallets from the customers. ‚ÄúFor honor‚Äù from Ubisoft and BF2 from EA. Changed for the better and are awesome games now with awesome Micro transactions. 
---
But fallout 76? No it won‚Äôt ever get better with the state it‚Äôs all. Thanks to y‚Äôall
---
You will die from rads in the armor I have it and it‚Äôs just like any armor if I wanna go in nuke zone I wear Chinese stealth suit or power armor
---
Having to use a VPN to get a half-decent connection to a online game like this is ridiculous.
---
I stack Born Survivor with Medic pump and First aid, add in a Vampire Weap and dieing becomes a thing of the past
---
No no, sure I see you in the event mate  if I dont are wrong we was 3 in the team, I, my friend dadou and you
---
They don't care  
---
Please keep buying atoms
---
I thought Duchess looked like Desdemona from fallout 4
---
Okay who gives a fuck? That shouldn't stop a wealthy corporation such as Bethesda spending the time and money to implement text chat into a fucking game.
---
Well lots of free to play studios have more people working on it , still giving tons of "free" Gems or whatever and bringing more players to spend their money on it so they arent "losing" Their money even "giving" 10 bucks or more every month in game currency.
---
And they are FREE TO PLAY , bethesda is charging for the game so if it gets more interesting for new players bethesda will profit more with the game sale and some aditional money with 1st subscription and atom sales from new players. Since 800 atoms in a month isnt enough to buy one complete camp set some people for sure would buy extra atoms like they did before the legendary run.
---
So at the end it would be an atractive for new players generating profits for the studio.
---
We need to have the vision ports be useable, like you can shoot from them with your guns.
---
Imagine that annoying super mutant that for some reason now and then comes to invade your camp, now you can just safely camp inside your bunker while sniping or machine gunning him down from one of the bunkers vision ports!
---
Amazing!
---
One of the raiders at Ohio River Adventures is implied to be a football player. And there were football uniforms (vintage ones with weird leather helmets, I think? I didn‚Äôt get it) in the Atomic shop, along with Grafton High Monsters team stuff.
---
1st
---
It got nerfed/neutered because it was causing frame rate and performance issues.
---
Usually yes and it's where I get most of my information for 76 but I'm curious what alternatives there are
---
first
---
3rd for me. 1st person makes me a little nauseous for some reason. I just find 3rd person to be more fun.
---
O yes I remember that now. During the vault 94 era people were complaining about that. Forgotten all about it.
---
Which Ally gave it?
---
Raider Punk
---
Ill think about that when i up the ante
---
Your point? 
---
Money doesn't get invested by a company into a game that isn't profitable.... So while those microtransactions don't go directly back into the game,  it makes it more likely the game will continue to have resources accessible.
---
&gt; Meanwhile, at no time have I done the event and not been being ganked, gangbanged, or chased by like 5-7 wendigo spawns constantly.  
---
Sounds like a good time :)
---
yeah like matteus said, also in that end crate you have small chance to have there cursed weaponry or other rare items , but dont worry, even if you ignore it. That rare item like cursed pickaxe will spawn in your inventory when the timer goes out
---
Your best bet is to hit up the trade subs and do some research.  
---
If it's not a trade item sell it in your machine for a modest amount.
---
If they are garbage legendaries I sell them for 50, 150, and 350 caps apiece for scrip.
---
3rd is best for NW
---
3rd for Just general running around/killing.
---
1st for Looting.
---
Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend just SS armor in a nuke zone man.... has great rad resist, Saved my ass last night actually. Accidentally got out of my PA when I was looting the queen, it kept me alive. I had to hit a radaway Every 10 to maybe 15 seconds but that‚Äôs better than getting out of PA and only having some combat armor on
---
Couldn‚Äôt find my suit of armor in the corpse so I had to wait for it to get recalled
---
I usually tend to help out new players since well they don‚Äôt have much and I give them a bag load of aids and I craft them some weapons and also tend to give some crafting items such as lead and adhesive and stuff. Cause well the majority of the community is really peaceful and that‚Äôs what I love about the player base in Fallout 76. üî•üôè
---
Data mined as an event drop with somewhat low percentage drop
---
Same here dude! Lol usually reach max 800 and I have to tend to get rid of some stuff
---
My character is lvl 260 and I jumped in a public group where everyone else was lvl 400 and beyond and they treated me like I'm fresh out of the Vault dropping all kinds of stuff!
---
If you die and have a loading screen after killing the enemies their ragdolls disappear most of the time if not everytime..
---
See, that's what I thought he was saying. The cursed weapons don't need to be looted from the box even though they appear in there? Weird.
---
5% drop chance.
---
It is still going to be one of the best legendary modifiers.
---
I got the bunker. I'm unable to place it anywhere but flat ground
---
You won‚Äôt die if you‚Äôre paying attention
---
My guess is that caps aren‚Äôt decimalized in the vendor interface and that causes problems. The exchange rates of ammo to points need to be in whole bullets to whole points, no fractions, so you have to trade bundles at a time. You cannot trade 1/2 of a bullet nor can you earn 1/2 of a point for example. Fallout New Vegas tracked and allowed selling for partial caps, but this game doesn‚Äôt. The vendor interface is made to handle the whole values of items and automatically rounds things off when you apply perks that reduce costs. Let‚Äôs say they did make the exchanger a store interface with some number of points available for trade. If 100 .50 cal rounds are 15 points(hypothetical, to make a case that exists in some ammo types here) , they don‚Äôt divide evenly if you sell 76 bullets and the exchange is not in whole value. But selling x amount of an item is a core feature of the store interface available on all items. So you‚Äôd be able to pick a number that doesn‚Äôt divide evenly. You either lose points or the system cannot even process the trade. 
---
All of that is to say that the current vendor interface would require exchanging bundles of ammo for points, rather than individual bullets, meaning they‚Äôd have to make crafted items of ammo bundles or something that we could exchange for a fixed rate. Think like bulk materials. Which means adding a bunch of items into the game that players who don‚Äôt have the ammo exchanger cannot really use.
---
 That‚Äôs so nice!
---
Ah, interesting. I've really only fooled around with miniguns. My level 35 Junkie/FFR/90 does really well.
---
I didnt say it was terribly boring just that priorities need to be prioritised. One shot combat mechanics is terribly.boring..
---
As I said, rewards are not worth the fight itself.
---
/imagines trying to type messages to several groupmates on a gamepad in combat
---
holy \*
---
I was sure it was fixed
---
feels nice getting lucky after a miserable session like that
---
 I like the tombstone or the vault bag, they both stand out better. The paper bag was a nightmare even when I was trying to find my dropped loot.
---
I agree that the system is difficult to the point of being impossible.   Who knows if I'll ever be able to get beyond that first rank.   I'm hoping they change it.   It's definitely difficult enough that I won't be chasing it.   Whatever I achieve naturally is what I achieve.
---
3rd is better at aiming since the gun doesn‚Äôt block your sight so it‚Äôs better in NW and maybe adventure. 
---
I usually play first since it feels better  when exploring or camp building.
---
  Well, not true, aswiftkickinthejunk has proved being mean is still very much possible. üòú
---
So who employs them?
---
3rd person unless I feel like making myself sick, then I'll use 1st person
---
Wait, what?!
---
C‚Äômon...For Honor was and is still a mess. It has half of F76‚Äôs playerbase, and that‚Äôs after them doubling their playerbase the past couple months. I‚Äôm sorry, but if you‚Äôre saying Ubisoft and EA understand the value of microtransactions then I don‚Äôt even know what you think you‚Äôre paying for. Those were the biggest 2 companies to defend loot boxes against them being categorized as gambling mechanics. Anthem by EA? It was so bad they have put all future updates on hold to completely rebuild the game in hopes of salvaging it.
---
You just used the 2 worse companies as evidence for good purchasing mechanics... they consistently milk  and reuse IP‚Äôs into the ground.
---
I'm confused, was the ammo converter updated again from Tuesday's (Aug-18th) update?
---
I scrapped that thing since its UI and usability was just real bad and not worth the budget space.
---
The efficient Gatling gun.
---
I've watched your video you shared. I live in TX with gigabit fiber. 35% to 43% of the time I have the same gameplay as you. Its safe to assume that a lot of it has to do with the servers themselves and their use of UDP packets with TLS encryption. UDP is a "fire and forget" protocol so the client &amp; server doesn't know if the packets get to  their destination at the protocol level. Therefore the application handles the validation. Servers suck so the handling of net traffic will suck too. If your net is  reliable then it's probably the servers mostly, and reducing the distance between you and the server may help. However, based on what I'm seeing on my end stateside, it may not do a whole lot.
---
Should have clarified...in-game mocrotransactions.
---
Private servers should be free? Adding infrastructure required, the maintenance staff and the utility bills isn't free so why should it be? Or those are less important than someone on Reddit deciding what should and shouldn't be free? And why is fracturing the player base between tons of private servers in an online game even a good thing to begin with? WoW did it with Garrisons. It went horribly and was hated. 
---
But let's see you show us 1 game that provides private servers of that scale for free. Might be harder to get an answer to that than misquoting old statements to make a point, like the Atomic Shop argument being cosmetic only forever you keep making that's badly misinformed not just because it was never said but also because you're taking bits of what was said out of context to make this point...
---
The next update should remove the need to team up. Thankfully.
---
I wish they'd create a jetpack for the CSA.
---
Ah yes because for honor a new IP trying a game style no game has done VS fallout a massive franchise with millions of fans. Yeah no correlation as to why 76 has more players. 
---
I don‚Äôt care what the companies said, I care about how they handled both games. 
---
If you say for honor is a mess, then you don‚Äôt okay the game at all. The game legit actually works unlike fallout 76.
---
I knew that but i couldnt find anything saying that modifier couldnt apply via legendary as well. Was just checking.
---
Edit: i guess i should have said legendary modifier specifically.
---
Both. I'm switching constantly depending on what I'm doing.
---
In-universe, it‚Äôd be quite useful since the Scorched plague is contagious and they need to know of incursions due to the lack of a vaccine. 
---
Really, it‚Äôs the Raiders fault. They killed Responders reps that tried to help them, blew up the dam and weakened the Responders. The Responders were close to a vaccine but lower manpower left them unable to complete it, due to the huge amount killed by the flood and the Raiders. 
---
The Brotherhood could have been the muscle, handling the Scorchbeasts while the Responders and the Free States handle Scorched stragglers thanks to the SDS, and, obviously the vaccine would have been incredibly helpful. The Fire Breathers would also be very helpful against the Scorched, since they used Ultracite ammo.
---
I agree with others is the terminal UI is to prevent duping. The easiest fix IMO is to have a option to convert all ammo of a type into points. I wouldn't care it the points rounded down. Its annoying to say have 789 5mm and only options are sell 100 or 1000.
---
Oh man... hahaah "can't find my giant robot outfit because this more giant flying bat is crashed up on it!"
---
But you‚Äôre asking for them to drop the ball on an imbalanced combat system so they can keep some people from getting cosmetics. Dupin is a big deal, half-assing an update to combat mechanics is game ruining
---
sorry i dont keep the track on names in public teams although if we did it together we surely nailed it.
---
Oh yeah, well never a crazy question when it comes to weapon prefixes. Took them a while to realize they had exploding bullets on laser guns and flame throwers.
---
1sr seems more immersive but 3rd lets me enjoy seeing my outfits
---
&gt; "And I can play with my wife! "
---
I just wish I on PC could play crossplay with my 11yr old son on his PS4.
---
LMG, but .308 ammo is a pain to try and farm.
---
It‚Äôs been very wonky for me since the patch
---
Smh didn‚Äôt know Bethesda did that updating thing
---
I'm curious at what hours does this happen. Most ISPs oversell their client-side nodes so peak hours (usually when people return from work) you get lots of congestion and latency. While ping tests and speed test may show good numbers, actual traffic could be affected during oversaturation.
---
Use your token and get the anti armour rifle. It will help you through the next levels once you scrap enough others to upgrade it.
---
As a Stealth VATS Rifleman, I can sadly confirm.

I've participated 4 times now and was wondering what the rewards were? Each time after the boss was killed I'm booted outside the mine and can't collect from him. Kinda sucks wasting hundreds or thousands of rounds and never get a prize.
---
I've even tried fast traveling to my teammates but I keep ending up outside the entrance.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ exactly, ran around hitting radaway I‚Äôm still fighting off scorched, I was stressing there for a minute
---
I have a ticket unanswered from over 2 months.  This is what makes me count down the days till cyberpunk
---
Not the only way, I be run it with a BE gatling gun and done it quickly as well. Even legacy weapons qont do anything of you dont have an efficient build
---
I get your point. Though the video doesn't show it as bad as it really is most of the time, delays usually are much much worse, that said, whatever is the standard of quality/speed of their servers the minimum a player base can expect from a online game being sold to them is for the servers to be hosted somewhat locally since that standard will surely be much worse for players accessing the server from thousands of miles away.
---
Not sure what you mean by news releases and ITVs could you explain? And the patch notes are great but what bethesda say they did is not always what actually happened
---
So is every other legendary effect that adds a percentage based damage bonus.
---
Junkies will be doing less damage but it will still be the second best damage adding effect in the game.
---
I get quite annoyed when I see cool stuff I can't get from the atomshop. 9 times out of 10 it's broken and makes my glad I can't get the items.
---
Aw man, those two extraterrestrials were on their honeymoon and you came in and destroyed them :(
---
*look confused about the comment*
---
*pulls down pants*
---
I think after a few runs people are already done with the exciting update. The encounter was fun but the rewards don‚Äôt match the time sink or rewards.
---
I used this for the first time last night. Not sure if it's just the xbox or what, but you can't excite without hitting B like 100 times to scroll back through literally every option you looked at previously.
---
Nah.  
---
Atom Shop needs to NOT be the driving force in playing this game. Be it atom rewards or atom shop items from the legendary run. Its a joke.
---
Only the Slots for the perks
---
If you grabbed the card, head into the room locked by it.
---
Its all getting nerfed. Junkies is still 2nd highest dps vs endgame mobs
---
Nice approach. I scrapped my magic weapons. I refuse to use them.
---
This is a satire forum and everyone is entitled to have their say. Duping is game ruining end of and altering the rules of engagment 2 years down the line maybe isnt game ruining but it may well losse more players than it gains.
---
Fantastic idea
---
And, ironically, each bullet is also lighter than .308, which makes literally zero sense unless Bethesda really wanted people to use the .50 MG.
---
That definitely is how they originally described it
---
Even if I did want to buy things in the Atom Shop (in which I do) what's the point of doing so when **the budget space to build to your home CAMP is so damn limited!** 
---
I cap it all the time and I keep scrapping things just to add more. I stopped doing that and its so frustrating.
---
What good is that? Lol!
---
Wait that‚Äôs it? I though coins didn‚Äôt carry over but the star ranks did.
---
Respectable. I haven't needed to use it. I may do the same.
---
*cast it into the fire..... Destroy it!*
---
*ISILDURRRRRR!!*
---
It shouldve needed that day... ;)
---
I feel rather than isolated assessment, put the F76 product next to actual similar games. People wig out when I say it's 'mmo', when the definition has been kinda skewed over time. Yes it's looter shooter too, but we also have unrestricted exploration, building etc with a decent chunk of other people. It's a diet coke of mmo'ing. 
---
I can say this game compared to its ZoS ruled cousin Elder Scrolls Online is totally forgiving. You actually *get* atoms- they've never given free crowns except for 500 when you open the account. Ever. And the ESO Plus is disgracefully necessary, and does all the storage doubling and infinite 'scrap' in the form of the crafting bag. They give you a jank tiny statue a month if you're lucky. No tent. No ranger outfit and such. If you want to meet a blood suckling cash cow, turn your attention to ESO. The only way you get any DLC is to subscribe, or PAY for each release. And, they'll charge you for 'chapters' even with a sub. 
---
F76 is much more player friendly in every regard. We haven't paid for any of the newer stuff. Correction, the ATX and subscribers paid for it (I don't feel the base game at $10 or less really helped). Trouble is people keep comparing it to shooters that pay out those fucking dopey 'crates' of flaming arm tats and other garbage. This isn't the same.
---
Anyways, I for one see the season boards cosmetics (free to unlock) and the atoms still being supplied via challenges and the SCORE is better than ESO where you get fucking *nothing* from playing.
---
They should also allow your torso paint to extend to the jetpack instead of the bare metal nonsense what we're stuck with otherwise.
---
I play many other FPS games at peak hours, lagging and stuttering are very very rare because they have servers in SA, so ISP isn't the issue. Anyway, as I've said on another thread, the minimum a player base can expect from a online game being sold to them is for the servers to be hosted somewhat locally, whatever are the variables that can affect any player's experience it'll be considerably worse if the server is thousands of miles away from a player.
---
I use it less than I did under the original UI.
---
No offense, but why join an event if you don‚Äôt want to help with event goals, but just kill enemies? Doesn‚Äôt that defeat the purpose of joining an event when you could just go through other places if you want to kill things?
---
Heh, Congratulations!
---
Well, thanks for the heads up.  The first new boss fight and it just sounds like a horrible experience with few rewards.
---
I.. ya I think this is where I uninstall and find another game.  I'm just done with this.
---
Bud... For Honour is from the AAA of AAA game companies. Ubi hyped that game for a long time. Yet in a single month it lost 1/3rd of its playerbase... twice. I know the game, played it plenty. Like all Ubi games(Division, AC, Ghost Recon), visually great, bugs aren‚Äôt too many, game itself is just bad. It‚Äôs exactly why Ubi doesn‚Äôt usually go for long-term games like they did with For Honor. Their games don‚Äôt age well. 
---
What both companies said is how they handled their games... you‚Äôre in a minority of gamers if you think loot boxes are a fun mechanic for wasting money. It‚Äôs the same thing F76 does, except there‚Äôs no promising what you‚Äôll get or even what it‚Äôs worth is. 
---
As you said, there‚Äôs no point in arguing further. It just amazes me you‚Äôre calling F76 players blind consumers when you have bought into Ubi and EA pricing content fairly. I‚Äôve never even heard a fan of either company make such a claim.
---
Most of the damage multiply is now an additive bonus. Hence damage is hugely reduced. I see more potential in Junkies. Due to the fact your HP is max and damage wise closer to bloodied.
---
I didnt know this tyvm!  Just sucks the camo looks sweet with my camo armor üòí
---
Yeah I'm mentally bound by self imposed RP'ing so I can't use JP. My PA has one though... I use it when I go shopping at vendors. You can still see the punji scratches on it lol
---
Im going dense chest for SS if that's the explosion mitigation one. Need to be more tanky these days.
---
Ah I also am a fellow water wookie. Thank you I shall up my game and shall also have a last laugh! Aaoohh wookie wookie wookie!
---
I mean, to be fair, it is an awesome haircut. I rock it on all my characters.
---
Ad Victoram
---
Yea, pretty silly to think Bethesda changed something for the better for once.
---
I thought the ammo machine would be helpful for my new character. Turns out all the ammo I need is expensive
---
I remember I tried to drop 20-something  Radaways to a newbie only to realize after that I dropped over 20 Pure Violet Flux that I was supposed to add to my vending machine. Of course I didn't ask for it back, but yeahgot to watch how I drop my things. heh
---
Write me dm:)
---
Same!

If you ain't first, you're last
---
Go to The Deep and into the Chinese base. At the bottom of the stairs near where you find Jen's mother is a big locked door, the key to open it is on a PA-wearing Chinese soldier at the top of the stairs.
---
Unlock the door and go inside, and the (*a*?) Motherlode will pop up that can be used as a free fast travel to 3 fixed locations in the Savage Divide and one location in the Mire.
---
Believe me, I feel for ya, They should definitely put regional servers to accommodate customers in those areas. It should at least put you on the quality that of people Stateside.
---
I didnt mind the old system compared to this one. They should have kept the ability for the game to see what ammo we had in our person inventory and just added the new way to buy and sell. I think that would have been the perfect blend between the two.
---
As far as making it like the vendor ui...I foresee a new way for hackers to some how make it to where all vending hives ammo points...does that make sense lol
---
Rng is rng.
---
She‚Äôs not filthy, she‚Äôs hotter than the others
---
Never said you weren‚Äôt allowed your say... but as both of us said, a bad combat update would ruin the game. Duping has been around for 2 years. If Bethesda is going to change combat mechanics then they need to put 100% of their effort into perfecting it. Every time they screw it up hundreds of their playerbase has to change their builds to adjust to the next broken meta.
---
They could also go further with the super hero/super villain angle (similar to automatron DLC for FO4) and have Brody become a supervillain with henchmen. So instead of making it so that he is just some raider, they can give him a super villain gimmick and make him his own faction.
---
What in Fallout 76 makes it so that the whole game doesn't work, as you say? It starts, it lets you play. Besides some bugs varying from minor to bad, the game still works, can be finished and played in full. Don't overexaggerate to make a point unless you can back it up with specific examples.
---
Taking a look at /r/forhonor and the latest feedback threads, I doubt your statement about it actually working is anywhere close to a widely accepted truth.
---
Why can't she be both?
---
I will not disregard it.
---
I'm looking at it right now.
---
Yea I put my fo1 tent on the back side of ATLAS for the material drop offs. That may be a very high traffic area in the future. Would be great to have a vendor camp there with everyone in the area...
---
What's the attraction to screws? What do you build with them?
---
It‚Äôll give you a one star legendary weapon. Whatever it is is really good for leveling but by the time you fit 50 you‚Äôll have something way better.
---
It's been the same here, for weeks every day was a run to find the weapons case and she would reward with a legendary, it's probably been 3 weeks  since i got one.  Now it's always rescue the settler for useless rewards.
---
Her holotapes made me so sad listening to her - just knowing that she had already died in game.
---
Edit: It has been pointed out to me that she might not be dead. For some reason I thought that she was during my playthrough.
---
On Xbox people post to the looking for group tab under people. Get messages all the time for encrypted and Queen
---
% chance lower generally?
---
I‚Äôve read if you start talking and don‚Äôt like what she had (you get an idea of what is is before accepting) that If you hop severs it can change.  Not sure if that is still the case.
---
Yes! Also have her replace her 'headache' lines with OoM related lines!
---
What rifle did you use? Lever action? I just recently got a great bloodied handmade with 33% + vats accuracy and 15% faster critical build up. I would really need the plans for a fixer aswell not sure where to get them, only from an event? And now I have to farm caps to buy the serums that I want.
---
That's what I thought too. I'm slowly building up a CAMP down the road to the other direction where the raider often spawns on the guard posts.
---
Yeah I got stuck not being able to move or open my Pipboy
---
If anything, at least give us the leather jacket + vault suit underarmor combo that the Overseer has. 
---
The sheer fact that she's wearing it tells me it must be in the game files already, just unobtainable by players.
---
Like NW... yea would be useful!!!
---
When you up the ante just get all the things that say run faster especially ones that say like run faster with blank
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Appalachian%20Thunder
---
Im not to familiar with the area I havnt really explored much of the location 1st time going there was to drop off steel for the new event.
---
The only good the rad resistance you get from SS would be passing by rad environmental effects, ghoul hits, and swimming. It‚Äôs not great in nuke zones at all.
---
That‚Äôs been the feedback on try #3 on this.  As someone with 5 characters over 250, but zero over 300, I‚Äôm double whammied by how lame this long-term player reward system is.  How hard would it be to just have a diablo3 paragon type concept where you are leveling your account?  It‚Äôs like Bethesda wants to be a decade or two behind their peers.
---
if she doesn't give you the quest to find a weapon just delete her chair as punishment and when you put it back she might be a bit nicer.
---
3rd so i can look at my bad self
---
I can't agree. If I say this when f76 was in beta or when it came out I would totally agree. But now I just can't because it's a barren waste of a game where pve is either too easy or impossibly difficult. PvP doesn't exist. The survival mechanics suck ass. The blueprint system is tedious and annoying. The atom shop well don't get me started micro transactions are just shit anyway. And the endgame offers nothing of value. I want f76 to be a good game someday (f4 is far from perfect I can't play it for long before it crashes and bricks my Xbox) but it just offered more
---
I'm from the west coast and play around 4pm pst and later. My user is Nebulous_zero!
---
I dont disagree with you pal on that point but what is the point of tinkering with the game philosophy 2 years in when they still cant stop duplication? All that will happen is all of a sudden the game will be flooded with TSE weapons instead or whatever isnt nerfed at that point...
---
There's a lot little guard posts in the area with raiders that show up. Several on the switchbacks on the road to the north east. Mines roughly south.
---
A lot of flatter space around there but unfortunately a *ton* of trees that won't go away with CAMP objects.
---
I noticed it used to be about 1 out of every 25 or so shots missed the mark when you had a high accuracy.   Since the last patch I miss way more often that number seems to be about 1 out 5.  I have a shotgun which I can stand in front of an enemy and blast away giving no damage.  I've found if you lock on, release and lock back on the hit/miss ratio goes back to what it used to be.
---
But yellowcake make orbital strike beacons! I know they‚Äôre effectively useless, but they‚Äôre better than fireworks!
---
I personally think it should work like an extractor. Put excess ammo into one side then select an option on the machine to transfer the type to and then get them from the other side.
---
Well, it‚Äôs kind of pointless now, since Scorched are everywhere, and you can‚Äôt just sit in Abby‚Äôs bunker and dispatch Free States teams to kill said Scorched, because those teams are, well, Scorched as well. 
---
Had it been finished beforehand, it could have been quite useful, identifying Scorched incursions and killing them before they can infect others. 
---
But, because nobody could work together (for that, I blame the Raiders. They are responsible for the Christmas Flood of Charlestown and they fought the Responders. The Responders had less manpower, meaning they couldn‚Äôt complete their vaccine), they all died and thus the SDS is useless. 
---
Had it worked, the Free States could have used it to track and destroy the stragglers the Brotherhood couldn‚Äôt handle (since they would focus on killing the Scorchbeasts), while the Responders finished and distributed their vaccine and used the Fire Breathers to mop up Scorched as well.
---
Yeah that along with half the other shit in this game that needs to be revamped and fixed
---
Also with one wasteland it‚Äôs going to be slower to level a character based on XP from NPC‚Äôs will be ranked against your current level. Currently you can just go to a high level area and smack the high level and you mates clean up...
---
I think filthy IS Hot!!
---
Will def add ya!
---
Isn't the Motherlode drill also pretty overkill for that tiny-ass entrance? Why not just use Dynamite?
---
In every other game, that would still be the fault of the devs.
---
Good to know.  Hopefully this will be looked at.  Unless it's the new normal.
---
I would definitely appreciate having someone to ask this things! Will add you when I get on.
---
The gauss mini gun works great against him. I have a two shot that does serious damage to him. But its hard to keep ammo going for it if fight him on a constant basis.
---
Same. Sons 13. Also PS4. :/ we could have a whole 3 man at any time we wanted.
---
Will check it out tonight when I get out of work
---
Thank you to all
---
Any idea How does the last stand does against him? Most of my heavy weapons are energy based
---
Cancel your Fallout 1st, uninstall the game until there are significant changes.
---
This is an echo chamber of "Game bad" yet everyone keeps playing it complaining.
---
What? Where can one see Daily Op rewards?
---
I looked it up though and the fact high level people influence the level kinda bothers me. The help would be very much appreciated.
---
Why would you even want to pollute your desired solo experience with something as repulsive as talking to other people you don't want to see or interact with? Text chat goes against everything you demanded about this game being played completely solo. Sounds like you're just here to complain about anything and everything.
---
You probably already know but you have to buy the other ones first, but yes i got it last week from queen of the hunt.
---
The harpoon drops if you use it like a normal gun.  If you use VATS it hits like a laser.
---
It's good to hear that you can at least play other good games and you have a reliable connection. One thing you could try is run Wireshark when you launch the game. See where the game reaches out (the IPs). Then traceroute to those IPs to see how you are getting there. Less hops is better. Build a spreadsheet of the traceroute outputs to their servers over time. Like 3 weeks or so. You should be able to see if the routes are consistent. If they are all over the place and constantly change, then you know it's the way ISPs and CDNs are routing traffic that makes the game unreliable causing a need for a closer regional server. You could submit a bathesda ticket with your findings as proof. It's the least you can do and you've at least tried all you could

best way to find news directly from Bethesda
---
Haha I don't think its cringe and kinda nice you let your brother choose your name. Will make sure to add you!
---
I didn't like 76 at first and the only reason that kept me going was because I got showered with items by a level 80 player when I was level 4. I thought it would be rude not to use that stuff and a couple of quests later I got hooked. I'm level 109 rn lol.
---
It should be out this Thursday
---
It would be great. Wouldn't it be AMAZING if you could see your inventory instead of exiting the interface to check how much of which ammo you have or clicking an amount and waiting 3-4 seconds for the dang system to inform you that you don't have enough? Wouldn't it be FANTASTIC if using the Ammo Converter was something you just did without first thinking "do I really have the will to go through this frustration right now?"
---
Does it happen on all your characters?
---
God dammit. Nevermind. I didn't realize the ultracite armor plans is for level 50. Wow. I just feel dumb now. Oh well.
---
I'm torn.
---
Whilst they're a contentious issue, I for one crack out a cigar when someone gives the SBQ five minutes or so fly around and be suitably tagged then blows her out of the sky with a few shots or less.
---
Walk up still carrying all my .45 and highly conditioned gun and collect my loot. So much better than losing tons and tons of ammo, getting a broken gun for a few flux, some notes and a trash legendary.
---
But yeah nothing worse than setting up and some asshole one shots it. Restraint people. Then again I've always believed that one shotters at events are 8yr olds using duped/hacked shit on their older brothers burner accounts because mom said they could.
---
I‚Äôve tried using them, but the enemies I try to use them against (ghouls, mostly, since they close in so quickly) keep staggering me, and interrupting the attack, thus rendering it useless. Have you guys somehow found a way around that?
---
You‚Äôre not a customer if you‚Äôre not paying for anything.
---
Yeah I need that nuke emote. Badly.
---
You wouldn't need to trade fractions of bullets because you're not trading bullets for bullets, you're trading with the currency. It's no different than how the vendors handle Stimpaks. You sell a Stim for 10 caps, but buy a Stim for 75 for example. There is no fractional Stimpak required for the transaction. 
---
And there is no need for the bullet bundles either. If you want to buy 100 rounds you use the vertical scroll bar, incrementing the quantity from 1 to 100. Let's say you sell 100 rounds of .308 for 100 points and you want to buy .44 rounds which cost 4 points each - you get 25 rounds. If the number doesnt come out even (let's say .44 rounds cost 7pts each), then you just have leftover points to be used elsewhere - the same as having a vendor bot with caps still left in him. If you buy 14 .44 rounds at 7pts, you spend 98pts and have 2 leftover points. If no bullet you can buy costs 1 or 2 points, then you'll have to supplement by selling more bullets, the same as vendortrons.
---
They coulda just done.. both
---
Is that evil being on reddit for a chance?
---
They could at least revert those challenges to rewarding Atoms or something, or like you suggest a pack of currencies. I don't feel like I rushed through the Legendary Run, I've been finished with it almost a week now, didn't use exploits and didn't lose a lot due to the bug(maybe 3 days where my challenges were completed); but still having the SCORE meter going off or the Challenge pop-ups showing up is pretty pointless. 
---
Y'know the ending of the Legendary Run was a humongous let-down, we got rewarded fireworks for fuckssake, why wouldn't we get some of those fireworks shot off when we finished Rank 100, but instead, we got zilch, nada, nuttin' at all. Not a bang, just a whimper.
---
I have the opposite issue, All audio but footsteps and guns becomes muffled and almost at a whisper volume level. Including the music.
---
right? idk why they would implement NW damage numbers but not compass degree markers
---
Same with the commander, she used to have me get the weapon case every day and I‚Äôd get a random legendary. But The last 2 or 3 weeks I‚Äôve only gotten rescue missions until yesterday I got the first legendary I‚Äôd gotten in a while
---
The problem is that those games have entire teams just pumping out cosmetics and are generally handling games with cleaner built environments and massive playerbases. I‚Äôm assuming when you talk about those games you‚Äôre referring to Apex, Fortnite, or perhaps CoD?
---
Games like CoD are built on hype, so when they offer small amounts of free items it‚Äôs because they just need players excited about spending until the next new title releases within 1-2 years. After that, they drop the game entirely and let players idly by the cosmetics from them at no cost to the dev company. 
---
Meanwhile, Fortnite for example has to completely rebuild itself and needs constant massive revenue streams. The predicted player count for them just rn is somewhere around 6 million to F76‚Äôs 36k, while epic games is worth 6x of BGS. So the reason they pull out great content quickly and for less is because they have number f76 just can‚Äôt be expected to obtain for a game like this.
---
Either way though. The mechanics work the same way. That $60 a person only recooperates part of the base game price. To keep content coming, BGS needs a reliable source of revenue that they know will stay wayyyy above the red at any given moment. Fortnite also has a $60 base game that one can purchase, but even if they didn‚Äôt it‚Äôs because the sheer number of ppl buying a single skin that probably took a month to make allows their revenue to stay high even if they were to overcharge.
---
*Sorry for the wordy response*, but making a good game is a lot harder than just copy the other guy‚Äôs formula! It‚Äôs investment, workforce, playerbase, f76 has just been drastically different - even from the start. And this isn‚Äôt defending the crappiness of some of their content, just to address why they kinda need to follow this model to stay financially viable.
---
I bought the power armor edition of the game, but I‚Äôm not a customer?
---
Don't bother crafting it, you get a guaranteed full set on a frame as a reward later from a certain quest :)
---
Yup. 2mm EC crafts slow. Hell 5mm isn‚Äôt all that fast but at least it has a high cap, you don‚Äôt have to babysit it to avoid wasting crafting time
---
Every single game I‚Äôve ever played has had dupe problems, WoW, FFXIV, Destiny 2. So please, tell me what games have you played where there haven‚Äôt been glitches and bugs? What is their fault is the lack of balance. Which they‚Äôre trying to fix but everyone is getting whiny about it.
---
Nothing wrong with being filthy...
---
She keep talking about her 'lap' :)
---
I‚Äôll be on in a few minutes
---
Mayor for a day and the waterpark mission are the only ones to wait on as the weapons are useable in the long run. The crane items will just be scrip and are more useful under 50
---
Try #3 eheh. We must endure. They will be released next year,but maybe in a reasonable state.
---
Lucky you, I hope I can find someone to trade it for a good price
---
What‚Äôs wrong with legacy weapons though? They were in the game legitimately at one point
---
As an alternative, build a decontamination shower so it sprays on her chair....
---
No shit. I been using. 308 since day one and always running low (well, dipping below 500 available rounds anyway).    
---
I will def look into this!
---
Didn't even think of making a new character, will try when I get home.
---
Plot Twist: they were in cahoots!
---
Whomever pockets are getting lined, they simply aren't doing their products justice
---
Complaining yes, but offering ideas for positive change.
---
Joining
---
I have linked a report in my post with all the IPs that it's reaching during the game, so that part is done. I'll do a traceroute and open a ticket, it shouldn't hurt, thank you
---
Don‚Äôt know, but I have his PSN, but pretty sure it‚Äôs against ToS to call em out.
---
&gt; I dont think anyone is using a fatman
---
I saw them get used as fireworks during Fasnacht. The super mutants that attacked during the event dropped mini nukes, so it was a self-sustaining display.
---
Happened today with a Moleman horde, a group of 3 of us ran around some mine trying to find the thing and eventually gave up.  We stood right where it was supposed to be but there was a solid wall which we couldn't get through.   Not the first time this has happened.
---
I haven't received another since update 21, but it looks like the Mire dailies still have it:
---
https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/003D6542
---
Once you get here will you please hold her in conversation so I can switch to my main and rejoin?
---
I think we‚Äôre both arguing for the same thing and not realizing it. I‚Äôm not personally that worried about the combat system being solved right away, I was under the impression that you just wanted them to stop tinkering and send it so they could focus on duping lol.
---
You know, I cant argue with that. Touche
---
You got it
---
If all else fails I'll use the boards final 500 atoms to top myself up and jump the last 3 tiles. I refuse to spend on it....
---
Logging on
---
Thanks ü•∞
---
Wait, I thought Abbie was dead? Didn't she start off the holotapes saying that if you are listening to this, that means I have died (or something like that)?
---
I never would have saw it coming! Working together? Smart.
---
You‚Äôre a customer for the base game. If you want continued development on a live server, yeah, that has to be paid for somehow.
---
Now if only the legendary system worked like this
---
It is the answer to ammo grinding if you have Fo1st and a day to waste. Forget building in your base, use workshops on your private world:
---
1. Seize all the workshops with a power box slaved to Poseidon. There are 6 (including Poseidon itself), search the list elsewhere.
---
2. In each build 5 ammo factories. Hook them up to the power box. 
---
3. Power up Poseidon. 
---
4. As a bonus, build a colectron in each as well.
---
The ammo you score is unreal.
---
It's a good start. Data over time is valuable. The more traces you have over more time the more ammo you have for your argument. Good luck and plz share what you found. I'm actually curious. Cheers
---
the what now?
---
I‚Äôll add you but I‚Äôm from uk so we probs won‚Äôt be on at the same time
---
My comment still stands, as that is a QC failure. If the employee is rushing the file out the door they're slap-dashing it together and not given the time to follow up on it.   
---
As someone in manufacturing you can screw up something you do several times every hour. That's what quality control is for, and that's controlled by management. These textures aren't being crafted with care, someone has to make a UV map, sees it's f\*\*ked up, and just doesn't have time to change it as they have to move on to the next item.
---
It's leviOsa, not levioSA!
---
I'm not sure if you were responding to my post directly, but I was definitely not making excuses for anyone.
---
Are you talking her health bar? If so, that is all the players doing damage.
---
Its not against the rules to put it on r/fo76bounties
---
Go get 'm bois
---
I have seen this post in so many different ways, all worded slightly different but wanting the same goal.
---
It is an echo chamber for the same problems we all agree with. That's why these posts constantly blow up. Because everyone agrees but nothing changes.
---
Bethesdas main concern is money, impact that they will listen. Their second is player base and time played, impact that and they will listen. I'm sure we could get a compilation of top posts and they could start there?
---
If you happened to have been unlucky enough to use it last AFTER that days update then it would complicate things and be at least another 20 hrs from when you had used it last. 
---
Give it another full day and it will likely reset. 
---
Most people forget when they used it last or when it last reset and the easiest fix would be to add a timer similar to the daily quest resets.
---
The juice
---
I was crafting more ammo when earle died and couldnt get his shit because the way done was blocked, 0/10. Even though I, a flimsy stealth commando was doing all the damage whilst the others just sat there occasionally shooting earle.
---
The other comments covered most details already, I just want to add that the helmet has a bright headlamp on it(no mod options) and for funsies, the ghillie skin completely obscures the visor.
---
You have clean spacesuit?
---
I won‚Äôt argue that. Just wanted to point out they aren‚Äôt working for investors! 
---
I think most the guys working on this are truly invested in the project, but my guess is we‚Äôre seeing the issues that come from having a chain of command. It‚Äôs probably someone from Bethesda Softworks going down the line to BGS that F76 needs to earn this much each quarter. since the admins aren‚Äôt the ones talking to the devs it can‚Äôt be ‚Äúlet us take a hit this quarter so we can make the game amazing at the 2nd or 3rd quarter.‚Äù Just make money. I guarantee if they talked to one another we‚Äôd see a much better game.
---
It‚Äôs prob the same effectiveness as us contacting support. The devs are probably just rushing to meet quarterly deadlines and can‚Äôt stop to make the needed fixes.
---
Still waiting on that PA bug fix for it...
---
Yeah on my other account. When I switched to my main, she only had clean ranger suit üò§
---
Still there?
---
Can I buy?
---
&gt;each bullet is also lighter than .308
---
hmmm
---
I‚Äôll be buying everything from the proud farmers who hit it religiously, gonna vendor hop like crazy
---
You can buy the plans for 50 cal receivers from the raider type vendors I believe
---
Yep
---
Perhaps, message me
---
Carrying on the tradition I see.
---
Man, I just want my one character to not be rolled back constantly, and have my items restored. 
---
"Check your internet". Jfc.
---
It's total damage from all players while you have been holding down the trigger.
---
For the records you don't need to keep the trade in conversation. You just need to basically stay near them. not sure what the range is. I think it's just keeping them in sight. 
---
Trust me. I kept the bot at charleston for 3 hours once and i sat at my fire in my camp for most of it
---
It has definitely turned into a Donkey ü•ï  system lately. I honestly don't even think that they listen to their player base, some will argue, mind you, I will argue back and say after 3800hrs I am pretty sure I see the big picture at this point.
---
The fractional bit is required because not all bullets have a whole number ratio of bullets to points. For instance the real exchange rate for 100 .50 cal rounds is 80 points, or one round is .8 ammo points. If you sell any number other than 100, 50, etc for other even multiples you will have a fraction.
---
This is absolutely not the same as caps where you always deal in whole caps/‚Äúpoints‚Äù. If at any point you have a decimal left over, then you have to deal with rounding, hidden decimals, etc that cause a cascade of other issues.
---
Because then people would no-life and basically skip half the next season if they could.
---
Good to know! I hoped it was something like that but wasn't too sure and didn't want to risk it haha thanks
---
Tbh, it still a mini nuke
---
Portable one, should be called micro or nano even %)
---
They rush you out the door because they need to clear the dungeon.  If people could just stay inside then it would likely cause issues with the instances staying open after someone has launched a second nuke and started a new iteration of the event.
---
If you want to revel in your accomplishment then just do it outside, that's how all of the runs I've done so far have ended.  It's not like you're missing out on much from staying inside unless you REALLY want hundreds of screws and wendigo teeth.
---
I wasn't the one powering the laptop down, the crash turned the whole thing off, then I had to hold power down to turn it back *on*.
---
Yes, you're correct. Every single game has had dupe problems, and usually, it's on the devs. Fallout 76 is the only community I've seen develop a true hatred for the people who exploit, and more so, the only community I've seen to actively blame them and expect them to stop for the game to improve.
---
It's exactly the same way as load bearing, a certain time to leave before the collapse of the mine.
---
This is incredible. The WC is probably my favorite creature of the game.
---
I occasionally stare at random atomic shop items as my finger gets closer to the enter button. It's just 250 atoms, and I really like safes, I'm sure it'll be worth it.
---
Oof, no new posts in there for a while?
---
Solo it on an empty or private server.
---
The gray in health bars on regular enemies is normally damage you are personally doing, but it seems to be glitched on the SBQ unless you're using an incredibly powerful weapon. Sometimes I see the gray as clearly being my personal damage output(particularly with "magic" heavy guns or pitiful melee surprisingly), but at times I see gray even when I'm not attacking. Which makes no sense.
---
But really, as long as you're fully specced with a good weapon you shouldn't need to worry.
---
These are what i'd love to see from the vault
---
\- Vault Lab Uniform (Vault Tec labcoat worn open over a vault suit)
---
\- Vault 76 soccer goals and soccer ball
---
\- Vault Gym Equipment (we did see the weight-lifting set in the datamine, so only need the bike and the pommel horse, but maybe a punching bag for seeing our damage)
---
\- Vault furniture (so pretty much what is missing from the current vault items including the vault bunkbed, maybe the washer and dryer, the cafeteria items, projector, etc)
---
\- Our trophy case from our bedroom at the start
---
\- A decorative pipboy stand/display case
---
\- Vault Tec Security Uniforms (not those cardboard ones from Fallout 4, but something like Fallout 3's)
---
\- Wallpapers and flooring for the various Vault rooms including the very nice wooden paneling of the overseer's office.
---
At this point just straight up give us some vault pieces or the ability to make a personal vault camp when interior instancing for camps arrives. Actually maybe it could be at a hidden Vault Tec tram station. You'd go to the terminal and be able to go to your personal vault or to one built by someone else that was set to open instead of private.
---
Party at Grahms cookout!
---
You would be suprised. Not posted often but they have serious members. Give it a whirl. Wcgw
---
cough * text chat *
---
I really enjoyed it, it was the most fun that I had in a long time and I liked that the ending timer was ACTUALLY challenging because you had to decide how happy you were just collecting stuff and then making a run for it.  
---
I literally cleared it the second the timer went to 0 and it was bloody brilliant. Give me more real challenges, give me urgency and give me creative ways of making a choice. It might get boring after awhile but I was bored halfway through killing the Scorchbeast Queen the first time.  
---
I get why I and a lot of other people complain about some aspects of the game but this is actually a good addition. It was the nearest my character has come to death for a really long time.
---
Honestly I was fine with how the ammo converter was at first, but the upgrade they added was even better being able to sell/buy ammo in bulk now.
---
(Once you buy/sell something, instead of going through all the menus again to get back to the same option, click the back button to go to the previous screen to immediately buy/sell again, makes it go by much quicker.)
---
My only complaint with the current menu is that buy is at the top of the menu instead of sell, I‚Äôll go to turn in some heavy missiles and accidentally buy some instead of sell some. Other than that I‚Äôm content with everything else. (That and maybe I‚Äôd also like the ability to convert fusion and plasma cores into points. I get a lot of those but don‚Äôt use the GP or power armor.)
---
If anything I‚Äôd really hate for it to use a vendor menu, for me the vendor menu is one of the most laggy things in the game. I‚Äôd prefer a terminal interface over the barter menu.
---
I'll have to do this, thank you. The laptop really does get hot as hell when playing, maybe it had something to do with it. Still, the very last time I tried getting it to work, it gave me an error code (0xc0000185), which is apparently for an os failure, so, I'm not sure if this'll fix the current issue. Still, it's not like cleaning the fans or vents can hurt it at all.
---
I just solo a wendigo colossus in the cranberry bog which was perfect to test magic weapons I had, interestingly my bloodied ultracite Gatling laser with 33 vats hit chance never had the magic effect on it while my bloodied limb damage mini gun did. So I think there just needs to be more testing to figure everything out. Usually this Gatling laser does have magic effect so I don‚Äôt know
---
Sell them at your camp vendor at 5 caps ago they will sell quick
---
"Ma Deuce" .50 cal all the way for me. If fired correctly, you can get accuracy out to a pretty far distance.
---
Very good to know, definitely leaning towards the t-65 first now.
---
Here‚Äôs an attempt at explaining why this can‚Äôt likely be done in a way that works how your asking:
---
Edit: in the actual exchanger, 100 .50 rounds trades for 80 points. This means that each .50 would need to sell for .8 points to the vendor interface. If it can‚Äôt handle a decimal, they‚Äôd need to either round up the values or force you to sell in certain amounts. The existing vendor slider does not support fixed amounts being sold (e.g. you can only select whole number multiples of .8 to sell).
---
The more you know
---
I made that mistake, too. Also xbox. What I do now is back up from each transaction instead of ‚Äòcontinuing‚Äô so when I‚Äôm done it‚Äôs not as far a trip. 
---
Someone else mentioned you can hold B and back out entirely, but I can‚Äôt confirm that yet.
---
Does it not have a way to connect power to it similar to the Red Rocket station?
---
This is all we can do though.  Getting everyone to stop paying is beyond our power.  I just want them to stop making the same mistakes that other games already learned from and solved.
---
:)     Yes.
---
Picked up a magic zealots Gatling laser today that I‚Äôm excited to try out on sbq
---
Oh dang! On my way! For the vendor
---
Plasma cartridges too.
---
The faster you can run üòπ
---
Game Masters on other games where exploits have taken place have literally logged into their accounts, dropped all their illegitimate items and thrown their player character off a cliff before banning them:
---
https://kotaku.com/hackers-mmo-character-publicly-stripped-killed-banne-1702670398
---
And you‚Äôre worried about Fallout 76 players not liking their hackers and expecting them to be good?
---
But I dont need 5 caps. I have 50000 of those already. What I do need is .45 .
---
I tired to join but it was full. but that's fine. i find a trader at lost home a lot. not that i need anything from the trader. i just like to hoard things.
---
FO76 filthy casuals is also great for people who genuinely enjoy the game.
---
May I ask why?
---
Stop picking them up if you don't need them!!
---
I think it would look best with the new Glaive. More knight-like.
---
Yeah, Ive put the accelerated barrel on so it's over 200. It's an Instigating/33 Vats. Am I wrong or should that be magic?
---
Nvm I looked at the footage and saw I wasn‚Äôt hitting the same head enough while using the Gatling laser
---
&gt; I figured maybe I'd buy 100x flares and I'd get 100x railway. Big nope. 
---
Seriously?  Your first instinct wasn't to test it out by buying a single round of flares and seeing what happened and instead decided to just blow your points on 100 first thing?
---
Bethesda of course.
---
My point is if development stopped those workers wouldn't magically go to tickets. They'd all lose their jobs and tickets would still be the same pace.
---
Wonder why they didn't made crafting bench for this. Or something in tinker bench to disamble ammo for % lead/gunpowder.
---
Or make vendor ui where you throw ammo inside and press fancy spin animation they added and it grinds into random materials that were used for ammos.
---
Biggest trigger for me is that you can't exchange ALL ammo type for points, in a single click.
---
Anything i feel like someone should use instead of scrip i put at 101c like cryolators and quad shotguns
---
Just making a bunch of raider PA for the noobs something to make me smile pretty shit week and cant be bothered to go hunting for them myself üòÇ

Line in the sand gives you 2 each time and I often to 2-5 sands a day for that sweet, sweet xp and steel.
---
Power Armor guy with fireproof. Poison pools are not nice. 
---
Also trying to juggle looting of wendigo corpses to fuel my crippling screw addiction and damaging the boss is very difficult.
---
I had 2 spawn relatively close to each other somewhere in south savage divide when looking for a new base spot recently
---
That makes sense. Thank you!
---
Haha for sure. Not sure if you remember but you're the one who told me about lost home and that's where we are now. So thank you again
---
You can server hop to make it appear, you just need to cross that red bridge and come back over to the station. Pops every 1/10 times I‚Äôd say. 
---
When I had a camp there (just needs to be away from The shack and that side of the water) I would do the bridge trick every time I came back, still have nuka cola clock plans that sell for an easy 300 profit each
---
NP.  spinning hard drive also generates heat.  If it cannot escape, that can also affect reading from the drive.
---
  Make note of what part of the laptop was getting excessively warm when you played. When you get the cover(s) off, check Which component is that area.  At that point, the component generating the excessive heat should be self evident.
---
Props to you dude
---
I would eat a broiled scorchbeast brain with some cranberry relish and grind for 301. No time to rest.
---
Who the hell isn't?  Cooking a ribeye right now and WON'T use the leftover grease as lube like I normally would, all thanks to my friends advice above.
---
Cool, thanks guys. I've gotten them a few times, just not recently so wanted to make sure it was still dropping.
---
The best way to do it is have a half decent weapon and some parts of half decent armour which makes people think you're playing the game when you actually have 200 stimpaks and 100 glowing mass stashed in your pocket. Aswell as 10 high quality 3 star weapons.
---
Bounty is up, have at it folks.
---
Idm the way their doing things. I like being able to craft specific weapons rather then pray to RNG for the right weapon and effects to drop from a monster.
---
Trading seems fair if it‚Äôs low to mid tier. High tier gear being un-tradable is fine to me since you have the feeling of actual obtaining the item yourself rather then someone coming up to you and say it‚Äôs duped and or bought off eBay.
---
I run into those kinds of people saying this to my legacy gear I obtained my self a long time ago. I tell them the truth then they laugh. It‚Äôs disappointing running into these kinds of situations.
---
Appreciate it if you ever come across some frames btw I wouldn't mind paying large amounts for them
---
No not even a vendor UI, just make it like a workbench. Like the Tinker's Workbench with ammo, but select either Breakdown or Buy, then have all ammo types in one big list, uncatergorised, and put a fucking SLIDER on to choose the amount. For fuck sake, what decade are Bethesda working in. Fucking Fallout 3 creation mechanics from a billion years ago. Get your shit together, everyone is laughing at you...and us for sticking with this game
---
I was about to comment this, I use 3rd because I start feeling like I have motion sickness in 1st
---
At the VERY least we should get this
---
/u/LadyDevann, /u/valseek, /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ I don't expect a response but would seriously love to know the answer to 1 question that keeps coming up - why don't you look at ESO and take what works instead of trying to make all these new features from the ground up, then have them delayed and redone because the vision that brought them to life might be flawed...
---
If you use ultracite reciever ultracite 2mm ec is actually cheaper then normal ec with perks.
---
I've tried there and haven't had any luck. I find tht trader at Lost Home pretty frequently though
---
Especially when running
---
Ah. I never use VATS on my heavy character so that makes sense.
---
Had I not just gone for the blood eagle one I would have gone for this. Saw one for the first time today with my toon and it was a lot bigger than people on here were making it out to be
---
Yeah but you barely craft any Spikes at a time and get fuck all points at the Converter. It's probably more worthwhile to use that steel when just making the ammo, even with the other materials involved
---
That is a great idea, let me save you some time though. The only response your gonna get, if any, is: I'll pass this along to the devs".
---
Fwiw: if its untaken when i get on ill scout him out. It can be tricky with no common friends but.... We'll see what i can do.
---
I would've posted on the bounty but i want to increase your chances a "professional" seeks to help you.
---
(Not great at pvp but I'm reeeeeeeally good at getting bombs dropped in very inconvenient fashion.)
---
Good luck
---
I‚Äôve had no luck with that one! Tbh I may have got that vendor less frequently but being camped there it felt like more
---
Having six rank-one legendary perks at the start of a new character is still very powerful.
---
Inside the Vault
---
Ok, bye!
---
Same but everyone complained about the change so I was thinking something everyone would be happy with
---
Get a few friends together and gather in Helvita, 
---
Have a couple of them wear Fastnacht masks start slow walking down the fastnacht event route while playing the fastnacht music over mic. You defend your friends from the scorched currently occupying Helvita! Also make sure to occasionally mack your friends with a burning sword.
---
I try to give new players a theme when I give them stuff "Today you will be a robot in full robot armor"  or give them some outfits to choose from. Looking good is half the game.
---
Bought 7 3* ranged weapons yesterday, all trash. Very disappointed mama mumbles. Your face privileges have been revoked.
---
Whole wastelanders quest in 20 mins? Impressive
---
Same to you
---
I‚Äôve never heard of a problem linking Xbox to Bethesda acct. 
---
Been playing since launch.
---
What you are describing isn‚Äôt even a ‚Äúbug‚Äù.
---
One of my main reason to use 3rd is to shoot things around corners(VATS build). It helps me stay hidden.
---
The only consistency I've seen in this issue is it seems much more likely to occur with enemies moving away from me than toward me. It still happens in other situations, but it seems extremely more likely to happen then.
---
I think this game just has some outright weird netcode, tbh. Ever tried jumping away from a ghoul's attack at the last second? If you try jumping away, it almost always hits you. But if you jump towards it, it usually misses. I can't make any sense out of it.
---
For some reason my cats showing 35% chance to hit always lands my 90% always misses on my first shots 
---
So now once I see 35 going up
---
I pop my first round and move on.  Not sure if it‚Äôs a visual bug or vats is just janky but I‚Äôm thinking about starting to try and transition away from vats even though that‚Äôs always been my fav gameplay style
---
Me either. Not saying it‚Äôs not happening just first I‚Äôm seeing it. Hope it gets fixed
---
Went in with 1130 5.56. Came out with 40. My team sat there and occasionally shot it.
---
Not to step on your toes, I really like your idea. Mind you  we should be able to bank points towards the next event, or go back to the original system until the next event starts. 
---
Because it just the right thing to do. Or your Idea üí° is another option that would make sense aswel.
---
No, but each instance is limited to 8 players so if you don't join at the same time as your teammates you might not get placed in the same instance as them.
---
NOICE!
---
Eh, I don't expect any, to be honest. But we've seen here that things get seen and they do make it into the game. Not all of them obviously, but those that make sense financially do. And what makes better sense than showing high numbers of active players while not needing to add new ones to keep the count high. Concentrate on retaining existing players instead by making it rewarding to replay the game and new ones will come themselves.

I am still using it out of spite, but man the floating interior is going to drive me mad

I found a guy who was level like 23 during a guided meditation event. He was attempting to fight the level 60+ charred ghouls. And would laugh and scream when a ghoul would suddenly come out from.the bushes and slap his shit. I would do my best to keep him alive, and killing any ghouls after he shot them so he got the XP. 
---
After the event I lead him around to a nuclear keycard cargo bot. Then had him travel to my cap and made him a level 25 Handmade and 30 Fixer so he could use all the ammo he was carrying when he hit the level requirements. I like to give new players I come across some nice gifts, but not too much.
---
That‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs just that this way you don‚Äôt need to use lead and gunpowder.
---
Steel is very easy to get. You can obtain 500 to 600 at west tek and that‚Äôs about a little more then 2k points at the converter.
---
It‚Äôs nothing game changing but it‚Äôs a interesting way to get ammo.
---
Its beautiful
---
They shouldn't have come to Appalachia after a nuclear war.
---
I think I'm still going to get both eventually, a unique Ultracite set is just too much to pass up on either way.
---
I repair from the favorites wheel now. I've "dropped" to much stuff before
---
I used to find a dozen a day, now it seems to be 1 if I‚Äôm lucky, at this rate I‚Äôll never get all of the PA paints! üò≠

Not at all. You‚Äôre putting someone out of his misery. One less tortured soul in the world
---
Got one last week.
---
Your poor toaster
---
Yeah I just made sure I‚Äôm not on for 15mins either side and I make sure I don‚Äôt play NW until all my other challenges are done. Only lost two days worth of challenges tg (game crashed loading adventure) got 100 the other day so I‚Äôm having a little break.
---
I've always thought it was pointless...
---
Thats why they put the Weightless armor in the game!
---
guns, specifically for mod farming. The radium rifle has an insanely low learn rate on mods and requires a metric shit ton of rifles to get the ones you want, let alone all of them. Each radium takes 11 screws i believe (don't quote me on that, just going off memory)
---
Ok well I might wait for that patch for Xbox than rebuild my base, I quite like that camp it‚Äôs a shame you can‚Äôt swap them you have to rebuild the whole thing again.
---
Agreed, but even there my company isn't doing too great... Instead of looking for good internal candidates to reinforce the analysts, they decided to hire externally... The first guy left after 3 days because it wasn't his "cup of tea", and the guy they eventually hired knew nothing of the business we operate in, nor the software we are writing. The result was predictable: I had to basically babysit him for 6 months only for him to then turn back on me and tell me how I had to stop "thinking for myself" and just trust his judgement on things &lt;.&lt;
---
The other analysts are great, but that one guy to me was an example of why our QA team needed to be operating independently from the Analysts and the Developers.
---
That happened by the way! Our QA team now has the final say as to when a version is fit for release, no senior dev or analyst above us to tell us that something isn't that important or how something isn't a blocker in their opinion.So far that has been working out great by the way, the fault most companies make is making QA departments report to the "R&amp;D lead". As those almost by definition tend to have a conflict of interest when it comes to the issues the QA team points out.
---
If I'm running a team of 12 developers, everyone has their plate full with things to meet a deadline, and I'm already thinking we might overshoot it by a couple of days, and a QA guy comes to me and goes on about a specific UI issue that according to him (and his experience with end users) will cause issues in our day to day operations, I could just tell him it's not a blocker, OR I could see which developer I can shove this extra bit of work to. Given things like that, it's no wonder why QA departments tend to feel ignored at times.
---
If you have a solid QA department and some talent in it, the best thing (in my opinion) that a company can do is empower the QA department to have a major say (if not the final one) as to wether or not a build/feature is ready for release.  
---
People seem to think this is industry standard already, but the opposite is true.
---
I use stinging, more bullets plus armor piercing
---
It‚Äôs probably just trying to save you from the disappointment and heart break if spending that scrip at the purveyor anyways...
---
Yes it is. The bug I'm currently encountering is described here https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.gamerevolution.com/guides/457113-fallout-76-linkfail-error-fix%3famp
---
I followed the "easy steps" to no avail. I'm not wasting my time filling out a help ticket for something that hasn't been fixed since launch in 2018.
---
I have two more days. Easy grind now.
---
I honestly dont get why we see this post in the sub once a week. Atoms are a premium currency, we are lucky we get any free at all. We were even luckier when we got them for dailies and weeklies, but we are still lucky now. Is Fortnite giving away free V-Bucks? No, they arent. Because giving away free premium currency isnt normal. Everyone wants something for free, and this post is no exception. You can earn plenty of atoms in game to get utility AND cosmetics, and thats just permanent challenges. Complaining about this change 2 months afterwards isnt doing anything, this isnt gonna change. Just enjoy the game, no need to complain about not getting free stuff. Celebrate what you do get
---
At lower levels the best thing to do is get a melee weapon as bullets are quite hard to come by.
---
What did the toaster ever do to you!?
---
Raiders make more sense from a survivalist point of view, going full tilt into a pre-war ideology in service of a government that was equally as shitty as the capitalist one makes zero sense IMO. And even if  play like your character was a communist spy or something you wouldn't be advertising it for fear of ending up dead by your fellows.   
---
There really is like zero lore justification for all the communist stuff, even the communist NPCs in game are either hidden underground.   
---
As far as the centurions go, I'm pretty sure those people just do not care for such things.   
---
The worst part about it is that it's all to make Bethesda money, and anyone claiming any adherence to  a communist ideology outside of game is going to be participating in capitalism right off the bat, so it doesn't even make sense from a metagame point of view.
---
What platform are you on? If PC I‚Äôm happy to donate to your enjoyment of the game. Once you hit higher levels you‚Äôll use less, farm more, and it generally becomes less of a problem
---
My rifle was hunting rifle. Shoots super slow and reloads slow lol. As for the plans I bought them from another player for 8k caps. To get it yourself well... only drops from encrypted event. Which is hella hard and is only a chance at dropping. Serums I was given free by another player but you can buy them at 400ish per serum usually. To farm caps , especially starting out, do a purified water farm. That's what I'm doing currently and I make max caps per day which is 1400.
---
Does the enemy have low DR? Do you have high Strength, or a suit of power armor? Try: Beat it with a stick! Optionally, use a heavy stick, or a stick that has been sharpened!
---
One time I got marsupial. I hit my head on the ceiling whilst going up the stairs.
---
The fact that they didn't make these snap to foundations speaks volumes about the quality of product they are producing.
---
I'd be embarrassed if I worked on this game. It's just fundamentally broken in so many ways. So many tedious qol aspects that makes one believe this game is not tested or even played by anyone working on it.
---
I feel like lag definitely plays a role also. On a really snappy server it's a struggle to start the melt.
---
Eso has miles more content than this game.
---
This game needs the grind to artificially extend how little there is to do.
---
Respec sucks so you should make new characters and grind legendary perks again
---
I've done the update, I've cleared the saved data files, I've done everything they've asked me, so I know this isn't on my end. That bundle is not in the Atomic Shop right now and that bugs me because I wanted to buy it.
---
If you can find it, lucky hole mine with excavator armor. Farm the lead deposits. Take over hemlock holes for the acid extractor. Kill super mutants or mole miners for guns and scrap for steel. Ammo smith and super duper perk card  and make some ammo.
---
Mug has been ordered.
---
Nice, now you're not going to find another one until November
---
I've never known someone on their first playthrough to have success with auto rifles. The reason is you just won't have the ammo.
---
It's your first character, you need to run semiautomatic until you have all the perks and things to farm and make ammo efficiently.
---
Get the excavator power armor and run the lucky hole mine while also controlling a acid extractor
---
I don't disagree with you. The player trading market for high end gear is just... ridiculous. And the duping and real money trading it spurs even more so.
---
I am happy Bethesda is trying to creatively curtail these problems while also introducing new mechanics like legendary crafting. I agree with you there.
---
I do think, however, there are some kinks in this new system to work out. One big glaring problem is how time gates factor into this system. I think if this new system will be the norm, they need to revisit the scrip limit.
---
For example, I'm trying to get a full set of thorn armor together. I log in every day just to exchange scrip. I hit my 150 daily limit,  buy 1 legendary module and 5 vault steel. Then I have to server hop to buy another 5 vault steel. Then I roll for the piece of armor I'm trying to get.
---
Usually, it's not what I want. I can't do anything with that piece besides scrip it, but oh wait...I hit my daily limit so I have to wait til tomorrow to try again.
---
It's painstakingly slow..
---
Anything would've been better than the 'converter' we've been given.  It's like we're having to do each operation in the equation they're using to convert the ammo ourselves. This is 2020, most everyone that plays this game realizes how computers work and that Advanced Mathematics exist, and that there is a 'background' to operating systems...Just let us throw this trash into a box and pull out the damned things we want so we can get on with playing this stupid game! This whole thing is ridiculous at times. 
---
Bethesda: 
---
"Let's make a game to go around shooting and killing enemies." 
---
"Awesome Idea! I love it. But, can we make it where there's an inventory system that people have to use every two minutes to play the game?"
---
"Well, I don't know sounds like it would get boring fas.."
---
"No! IT WILL BE COOL! It will add so much immersion, like you're making choices on a micro level, you can decide how many of one kind of bullet you want to turn into another kind of bullet! That would be awesome! And it will make people really invested in how they're playing the game!"
---
"I guess, I mean, you're the boss, and I'm just an hourly worker.."
---
I dont think super duper has even unlocked for him yet. He's in his lv 30s with few caps... only choice he has is to receive donations or go farm using non .45 stuff/melee.
---
OP, if you go this route, you need: lots of acid, gunpowder, steel and excavator armor. Lucky Hole Mine gives lead ore, which needs acid to smelt down.
---
If there is, it doesn't work.
---
Sounds like a job
---
I am wondering why we don't just use the ammo machine at the abandoned Munitions Factory? It is already set up just like the mineral extractors. Seems like you could get a two-in-one with an ammo machine and a converter.
---
I'm on PC
---
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not a bug with the game. Your issue is with how Bethesda maintains and creates temp user names. You should be able to just create a new user name, no?
---
It does not meet the definition of a ‚Äúbug‚Äù lol and certainly not related to the game.
---
Anyway I hope you sort it out.
---
I only knew that because I watched some videos from when it was on the PTS. Back there the cursed weapon would spawn at the crate, now it's given as a event reward regardless.
---
I‚Äôve even managed to rack up duplicates
---
Ok.. I have a deathclaw gauntlet but I only have 1 point in strength. So I'm hitting things very weakly. I'll do more for melee then
---
Yes you can, i've done it a few times
---
I had something similar happen. The way it was fixed was put a ticket into support and say I can't link my xbox account to bethesda account. They will go through a few steps and done. Basically it has another account linked to the xbox account or something along those lines. Was fixed in a few hours. Also make sure you create a bethesda account manually on pc or phone then link that one to the xbox.
---
The decisions that are made are very strange to me...
---
I agree with you on the limit. It would be more bearable for me if it was a weekly limit. I really don‚Äôt want to log in daily but am forced to if I want to speed up getting modules.
---
I play this game and many different ones. I want to at least not be punished playing other games for a day or 2.
---
You will die, fast
---
we know the risks.
---
What are you playing on? 
---
PS4 has been fine for my group. 4 of us.
---
Please don't do this and instead lv up to the point where you can contribute. How do you plan on even surviving the drop into the arena?
---
Or just give us an ammo factory type thing that I saw in the build menu.
---
I love it.  :)
---
I would have to create a new Gmail account and new Bethesda.net account. It's not much work involved but literally the first thing I encountered with a game that has a terrible reputation is encountering a system so badly designed that it just randomly decides some users can't use Bethesda accounts they've had for years is an automatic strike 3 for me.
---
LOL!   Not even one day of relative rest?
---
Vault Tek would be proud ü§™
---
New boss, permanent i believe.
---
No. Unfortunately.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Wiped out my daily and painfully, weekly challenges.
---
What‚Äôs the rare outfit trader called? I‚Äôve been looking for information on her spawn points but I don‚Äôt know her name to look it up
---
I see what ya did there
---
Really every level past 50 should be veteran levels. So you make another character they start level one. Once 50 every character on account shares the pool of levels and contributes to it. Shared legendary pts for card scraps. Not that hard and easily fixes problem.
---
I‚Äôll let you know. I‚Äôm on Xbox as well
---
PA has a 42% damage reduction right off the top. Don't know what kind of armor you have but damage and energy resistance don't matter much once you're above 300 or so.
---
Bethesda Game Studios games are meant to be played in First Person. The only time there is a reason to go into third is to look at your character for either a cool pic or to check an outfit or hair change.
---
How do I know it's meant to be played in First Person? That's the default, you have to switch to 3rd. Just like games like RDR2 or GTA V, by default they are in 3rd because that's how their meant to be played.
---
Right on what‚Äôs your in game name?
---
Xbox and I even switched over to Ethernet and no change
---
I'm worried about 76 players putting the burden of the issue entirely on the players, and not the devs.
---
Disagree, if you‚Äôre running melee then bloodied swing speed sledge is pretty good.
---
But there's double score daily coming up tomorrow I think for several days.
---
Also, don't be in game when the challenges reset. I think it's noon EST.
---
Power armor has unlisted universal damage reduction for ballistic and energy damage. Before your resistances are applied, this is. Level 15 Raider power armor is better defense than a full set of Bolstering or Vanguard's secret service armor, basically.
---
It just says "scavenger trader" I believe, but they all say that. Just Google rare outfit trader? I find her at Lost Home in the bog fairly often
---
Thanks a lot. It seems every time I find a scavenger trader they‚Äôre a chem dealer lol
---
That a really good point, the cranberry bog should be a glowing sea/constant rad storm at this point no?
---
i didn't even know there was a trunk to loot at the end.      I Don't understand why they keep putting these tedious as hell timers in when the servers are as laggy as they are.      im worried about this with the "Daily Ops" thing too.
---
Seriously. I play with a group and wouldn't mind having different characters to fill different roles. As things are right now, it's a slog because I already know at level 30 that I need 10s of 1000s of scrip and gold to get the gear I need. I'd still need gold and scrip, but at least leveling wouldn't be such a chore.
---
Haha I know the feeling
---
Ooo. I have it on their as well. I will check it out when I get home. 
---
Do you think it could be your internet?
---
Somewhere around 3% chance to get one when you turn in a ticket. They are slightly buggy I believe, sometimes the skin won't display in your inventory or on display shelves
---
Even graying out choices we don't have would make it way more efficient.
---
It‚Äôs the legendary run challenge- buy and item from another player. You need to do it three times.
---
Seems like an overreaction to me and has nothing to do with the game but you do you
---
It isn‚Äôt on console yet but it is permanently in the game. You have to nuke Monongah Mine
---
Daily score challenege
---
Inaccessible w/o an IG account.
---
Its because of the daily challenges you need to buy 3 items at a player vendor üëç
---
That's really good! Very creative.
---
We here at bethesda studios want you to stop using drugs. That's why we are nerfing junkies.
---
All good guesses.  The correct answer was 3rd person.  Thanks for playing!
---
I prefer Quick for minimizing AP cost and reload time, but I suspect this will change with Update 22's damage sweeping modifier changes. I hate it because I've tried them all and Quick has been my favorite for a long time.
---
Because people are Stingy for the daily legendary run challenge
---
Fine you can have one ‚Äúnight‚Äù to party. Nukashine time!! Haha
---
I do it every day for the 'buy three items from another player' challenge. Thanks for the 3 shotgun shells :)
---
Permanent.
---
Are you the fucking virgin who one shot my SBQ before anyone could get credit
---
Yup daily score challenge.  If you actually have what I need though, I‚Äôll buy 1, 2, then clean out the rest lol
---
It's got pure shit in it. If you like shit then go ahead.
---
It works w all stims
---
It does. It also costs a lot when you count all DLCs and xpacs. But they don't add anything truly meaningful to me. I played since release and honestly still get an urge to come back. However, it's nothing more than a sunk costs thing. Between ESO+, expansions and all crowns on sale, it adds up. 
---
But then I remember that it's all shallow. End game with it's flat progression gives me no real reason to go into new, harder dungeons because I'm stacked with meta gear. And they can't make new gear that much better because the P2W cries start. As if we ever heard that when WoW released an Xpac... The housing aspect is useless. No one ever sees whatever's inside. There's no point to doing anything the way I see it.
---
FO76, while having less content overall, at least to me, has more meaningful content. I want to build and improve my camp. I want to trade with players. I want to do daily quests because rewards have use to me. I want to play and keep playing and there's always a reason to, while in ESO I log in and realize there was none.
---
Are you not doing the legendary run?
---
Yuppers.
---
You take less damage overall but you loose those sweet legendary effects. It also reduces rads behind the scenes even if you manage to match the rad resist numbers between PA and regular armor.
---
bahaha yea same üòÇ
---
Ur name wont come up mine is publicenemywon
---
I have enough points that it wasn't a big deal, plus the 1x and 10x worked fine.
---
 Knowing this game I wouldn't be surprised if it did give me railway.
---
&gt; For instance the real exchange rate for 100 .50 cal rounds is 80 points, or one round is .8 ammo points.
---
You could simply multiply both sides by 10 such that a .50 cal round is bought for 8, not 0.8. Then there is no problem. Furthermore, a proposed redesign isn't shackled to the same exchange rates anyways. I'd personally just start on the left hand side, assigning values of ~1-10 for the selling of the ammo and then moving to the right hand side and assigning the purchase value i.e. "exchange rate". It would be no different than how the devs approached buying and selling from the vendor. There is a default price at 1 Chr for the selling of a Stim which is different than the buying of a Stim, and those values are different than MedX, etc.
---
The mistake is that they didn't go with my plan *initially*. The only reason that bulk quantities were chosen in the first place was due to the poor UI they decided on, which required speeding up the process.
---
You showing that it's challenging to migrate is just the result of a botched beginning, not of me botching the proposal. 
---
&gt; This is absolutely not the same as caps where you always deal in whole caps/‚Äúpoints‚Äù
---
Right, they messed it up. It should have always been priced based on individual value of items in whole numbers, the same as the marketplace for caps. An individual value, not a bulk value
---
Time gate progress on the board under the name of ‚Äú moves‚Äù but you can pay for more
---
Haha noted. I‚Äôm mostly blind so at least the better headlamp sounds interesting.
---
I'll be on in a little and try to add you
---
God everytime I‚Äôm to late. I always find her but it‚Äôs always freaking chem recipes. I have no luck
---
I buy 9 rounds at a time so that person gets all the caps I'm spending, its annoying I'm sure, especially if they have alot of ammo, but if they understand my approach im sure they appreciate it lol
---
In the luck special get Scrounger and Pharma Farma. Scrounger will mean you find more ammo in ammo boxes. Pharma Farma will give you extra Chems. Sell the chems, solving your caps problem a bit. Sell the good ammo you don‚Äôt use in your vendor for a cap a piece. Get the ammo converter and swap the shitty ammo for ammo you need (it‚Äôs slow but it will work). 
---
Make a habit of visiting the prison, motel in flatwoods and Charleston fire station each day and picking up the weights for lead. Tag lead as an item to search for and learn to pick up everything that has it (cans, paint, toys).
---
Every other game plays fine as far as I can tell.
---
&gt; we need your help
---
&gt;  lvl‚Äôs 24 and 19
---
You don't ask for help, you ask to be carried through the event. While I support lower levels, in this instance this is not going to end well.
---
If the Big Guy doesn't get you, the uncounted wendigo adds will. And once you die, there is no rejoining the event/team.
---
Do yourself and others the favor and get to lvl 50 so you can at least get some weapons to kill some adds.
---
Thanks for the answers lmao. It totally went over my head that people were doing it for the challenge.
---
Fast travel to teammate works, straight back into event.
---
I must have redeem about 20 to 30 of these tickets and never got one.
---
‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è I'm hopping some more. If I find her again I'll *definitely* make sure you get a shot at her
---
just from a math standpoint, the 50 cal is just "average" when it comes to DPS. also, bring more bullets. i wouldnt go into an event like this with 4 digit numbers of bullets
---
and i d very much like to see that " very optimized heavy gunner build"
---
personally i did around 20 runs so far, in most of them Earle died in 10 minutes or less (with me + 2 other players)...without any magic damage or hacked shit
---
Ah nice. I've never given the radium rifle much thought. Are the mods worth learning?
---
Fast travel out people....
---
*'Toss a cartridge to your energy weapons enthusiast~!'*
---
No you don't.
---
The risk is not totally yours. The event is set for 8 50+ players, so if there are 2 nfg the other 6 need to pick up the slag and work harder.
---
But but...todddddddd I wanna do my drugs. Let me abuse my morphi-...I mean med-x
---
No it didn't work for me. Unfortunately....
---
oh, hold on ill upload to imgur
---
Done it twice after CTD and also joined someone elses event by joining team halfway through.
---
Thank you. I find her at lost home and near Berkeley a lot. First time I found her near the cult of moth man near Berkeley she had all outfits but yet even tho I played since beta I just know realized the value of certain outfits so I never got anything. The other night I posted that I found her as a 3 star legendary... but guess what she had?!?!? Chem recipes lol
---
Amazing how many people are coming out to defend the practices of a company that doesn't seem to care about its customers.
---
If Bethesda wants their game to be better and reach more people, they can start by making a game people want.  Their monetization of the game and limiting of how Atoms are gained isn't going to make a huge difference there in attracting players.  Considering what we get with the existence of Fallout 1st, and the Atomic Shop, I see no compelling reason to believe that Bethesda's monetization schemes are some necessary evil that is guaranteeing high quality content that's been rigorously tested and planned out.  In fact, it seems quite the opposite, and that them trying to bleed more from players has put the game into a sometimes worse state.
---
The simple fact is players have no obligation to support this game beyond initial purchase. That's all on Bethesda, just like it's on them for failing to deliver a high-quality game that people want to play.
---
While i will admit that New Vegas is one of my most favorite western themed types of games, its a bit unfair to compare red dead and New Vegas as they are completely different games with completely different narratives.
---
They are very rare
---
Swift on combat shotguns
---
This would be huge. I have 4 characters that I maintained prior to wastelanders. Now 2 of them are just mules No way am I grinding that rep ever again. Not a chance. I had more fun when I could choose which build I wanted to play at any time. 
---
Perhaps they are incredibly hopeful that we'll spend our in-game time progressing other characters through WL and other content. But let's face it, the quest content doesn't have exciting replayability. The replayability is just grinding for gear. Be that killing legendaries for drops, or for scrip, or for gold. I'm going to put the same amount of game time in whether I am able to play 1 character or 5. Obviously it's more fun to play 5. Plus with the new Daily Ops coming, build variety is actually going to mean something. I will want to use a melee character some days and ranged others. Unfortunately I'll just be using ranged all the time and wacking mobs to finish them I guess. 
---
The incentive for $$$$ I see for them to allow some things to be account wide is in the atom shop. When I'm rolling 4-5 characters, I want them to have different clothes and camps. I would have bought all the commie stuff to build a commy camp for a character. But since I just spent 12 hours building a camp, I'm not going to destroy it for this new stuff. 
---
I hope they see this and figure it out. I feel like this is such a no brainer. For me, all I really need is the ability to give the god roll vanguard gold pieces I get on my bloodied build to the right toon, and weapons too. Don't make me learn the plan either, that's pointless. I'm not asking to make them tradable in the world, just between our own characters. And also make learned plans shared amongst all characters. At least the special event plans. Such as the mole miner bucket and Halloween plans. Atom shop stuff works this way, or at least it did till Beth read this. Now you'll have to choose which character you want your atom shop purchase available on.....lmao

Used to be common as muck, now quite rare (but recently duped)
---
Chameleon mutation was great.. at launch. 
---
Then 3-star legendaries became a thing, so you could have Shadowed Chameleon armor with 'harder to detect while sneaking'. Now they've added the Chinese Stealth Suit. Chameleon mutation and the Weightless legendary effect have essentially been nerfed over time and buried under better options, leaving it behind.
---
Because nerfing is "content" üòâ
---
Everything in the game is base game. Go to the Bethesda game store now and see what's advertised as base game. They made a commitment to ongoing development so, no matter how much you'd like to, you can't dismiss someone as a "non-customer" when they bought the game based on that commitment.

&gt; ‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,‚Äù¬†explains Hines;¬†‚Äúall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù
---
Pete Hines himself says that every customer will be receiving ongoing updates for their purchase free of charge,  would you like to contradict him?
---
Awesome, thanks!

0.15% chance to drop from certain events
---
Same. Gt: orias
---
playerbase is a lot more toxic too :(
---
The event is sooooo broken.
---
I use a BE25 HM in ultracite and the drum magazine, just to circumvent the vats-bug. I also only vats when it's above 75%, anything below that is ADS.
---
Legendary Run is almost over and people still act surprised when challenges auto-complete or others buy 3 ammo.
---
Link?
---
On the market it‚Äôs worth 10k-20k a piece, but depends on the buyer.
---
Today I got booted 12 times from servers. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Any time I travel.  It's a nightmare.
---
Couldnt they simply round down to the nearest point/bullet?
---
My character is a complete cola nut, they collect all nuka cola memorabilia and have a museum of all nuka cola products
---
Nice!  We need some shots of the inside.
---
I've had the game for about a week now.
---
I appreciate it, I just googled ‚Äúwhat happened to Jen‚Äù and this came up. Thank you!
---
Haha, I‚Äôm working on a collection too
---
You : -Gives opinion.-
---
You : "That's not an opinion either."
---
Me : "It's almost like you don't understand how the world works."
---
You : "I do."
---
Literally nothing you've said in this comment has anything to do with whether or not scrip limitations need to be removed from the game.
---
I played eso quite a bit then I started playing this. 
---
After awhile I stopped playing ESO while I‚Äôm still here. Playing fallout 76. 
---
ESO to me feels like any standard MMO with some unique stuff like thieving. It may have more content but it‚Äôs just all feels the same everywhere I go. Another reason I stopped is the amount of money they keep asking for minor and big expansions. Jeez.
---
I mean, there is also the Excavator power armors, which are specifically meant for mining operations like this... Through to be really appropriate we should have a giant drill melee weapon to look the part. Something like Bioshock's Big Daddies or the miner class from Deep Rock Galactic.
---
jfyi CSA is available w/o the quest.
---
Finally. Someone or someones else saying this. I thought I was loosing my damn mind. It seems worse in power armor. I am getting my face chewed off by lvl 68 super mutants using an exploding Lever action (with reduce targets damage output) and a handmade legendary. It says 98% chance to hit no damage done like the shots have gone completely wide. Or either gun I get say 2 damage. I honestly thought I was loosing my mind and was wondering if it was me.
---
Riflemen and instigating weapons is a badass combo , my lever action wrecks
---
I tried to use the converter last night and there wasn't even any usable UI just flavour text at the top.
---
&gt; If you don't want to spend money in the Atomic Shop for cosmetic stuff, you don't have to. We give you a shitload of Atoms just for playing the game.

---
ü§î Hmm... So much for that.
---
Nah i died right after he died and the entrance gets blocked off
---
hold the button down
---
I decided to give it a try for the first time when it got added to Xbox game pass - figured if it was as bad as everyone said, I‚Äôd only be out a couple bucks. 
---
It‚Äôs perfectly enjoyable playing it like any other Fallout, just going through the story missions and exploring solo - though combat is a bit more difficult at times than the other games. Maybe the endgame sucks, idk I‚Äôm not there, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt skip this game entirely. It really doesn‚Äôt feel incomplete picking it up now, but I can see how it would have before the NPCs were added.
---
Become a Melee build. 
---
Seriously, I‚Äôm currently Level 446 and have been TH Melee since Level 25. I drop most ammo I accidentally pickup, or throw it in Whitesprings Station Cigarette machine.
---
Why do rare?
---
i really doubt anyone would care if they rounded down to the nearest bullet/point. Call it a 'tax"
---
Save caps and buy one
---
They wanted to make us use the nuke launching system/grind they put into the game, which is the real reason... Gating both of the end game events behind launching nukes. I suppose we should be happy they didn't require use to use a nuke to crack open Vault 79.
---
the ammo collector that you buy from the raiders for gold is basically what you described.
---
I'd be happy if they at least added back the atom challenges after you've finished the current season.
---
This aged poorly:
---
&gt;If you don't want to spend money in the Atomic Shop for cosmetic stuff, you don't have to. We give you a shitload of Atoms just for playing the game.
---
Why do? Or how come? Either way...they vendors dont sell them anymore and have an extremely low drop rate from certain events
---
Amen
---
I'm on ps4 and private servers are worse than public!
---
Wait u mean my 60 dollars from months ago isn‚Äôt enough to run all the servers and new content?
---
Mine is the child of an AMS and Robco executive who after leaving 76 who gives guns to the fellow people in Appalachia and a  rest stop for traveling merchants.
---
There‚Äôs a 50% purveyor sale next month. Make sure you save up for double the disappointment.
---
I mean, if it works it works. No problem.
---
that really isn't a lot though. I've spent 4-5k in one day and had nothing but shite. Maybe the odd thing worth 1k to someone. You'll be swimming in legendaries in no time. And you wont be able to scrip them quick enough.
---
There was none of this purveryor nonsense in the early days. You didn't just go around scripping legendaries willy nilly. You sold them to npc vendors for a few caps.
---
Just trade with others
---
I don‚Äôt want to buy every good drop I want some rng to be nice eventually lol
---
I was lucky twice on the same character.    
---
I got a Two-Shot Combat Rifle 3 Star. No massive damage but still does really well. Another is an armor piece. At this point I don't remember which one it is. I HATE how devs make the drop rates so low or in this so random it's all forcing you to grind(lose time) for such a tiny reward. IMO, it's not worth it.    
---
I've never had a ton of caps. I have made some large purchases from players to boost my gear. I don't rely on the weird mushroom lady. I end up scrapping them back b/c most people are looking for specific armor sets with effects and weapons. Everything else is largely useless for characters.    
---
I mean, who thF needs a Troubleshooter's Knife? Here's a good idea. Let's let randed effects be put randomly on melee weapons. How FUN!!
---
Good luck with that and the scrip bitch :-)
---
Lol that's awful. I've only been looking for her lately but one time I had the same thing happen, I found the 3* legendary chem dealer üòÇ
---
Agreed I‚Äôve worked with some excellent *professional* QAs and they‚Äôre worth their weight in gold
---
Did you do 2 or 3 star?
---
My gauss mini is a magic one, it's better then my junkies faster rate mini which is kinda sad.

The fix seems to be to reset the password for your existing bethesda.net account and or complete verification of the original account and then try to re-link. Have you tried that?

I still have a urban mask from long ago when they were everywhere and easily obtainable.

*sad face*
---
3 just in case it was good just not for me I‚Äôd sell but they all were garbage. Best was a mutant ultra lite Gatling laser
---
I thought this was the case as well, but it looks like the mainstream definition of "food build" is someone who slots QoL perks as part of their build.
---
That comment seems toxic
---
I've played it 3 times. My character's primary weapon is the "Final Word" 50 cal. The first two times, the fight lasted the entire timer (I think on the second fight we finished him literally as the timer reached zero, but his corpse disappeared and we had to run for the exit, so I have no idea). I expended about 15000 (fifteen thousand) rounds of .50 on those two runs altogether.
---
The third time, I don't know if somebody else had an OP/exploit gun or what, but it took us about 5-7 minutes to put him down, and I used maybe 1500-2000 rounds.
---
Didn't get a chance to try it today yet.
---
And yet I've never paid for 1st, and somehow I have an abundance of everything I need with stash space to spare.
---
Always start 2 star until you have something you like
---
Stinging
---
Interesting. Thanks for the replies, guys. Appreciate it.
---
Wish that information was more clearly communicated in the game itself though.
---
Can the key etc be retrieved after that quest has been done? I didnt know about this and have already long completed the Wastelanders quests. I think I saw the door you are talking about but thought whatever was there would become accessible further into the quest and then forgot about it
---

shit is fucked

Where are you located approximately?

Sounds like u don‚Äôt want to play at all so bye
---
Chameleons ARE naked. A mutation like that doesn't affect non-living material. Not stupid. However, someone was smart to put in that Weightless effect so it could be used effectively.    
---
A chameleon has to stay still to stay hidden. Some prey have really good eyesight. You're first 4 grievances fit a how a real world animal works.
---
If development stopped the game would stop?
---
Sold my first one to vendor for 100 caps or whatever, that's what I thought of them then..
---
I've tried going to vault 76 on 4 different occasions to drop stimpacks and water to new players. Every time they just looked at me confused and ran away, even after I emoted to come here and punched the bag 20 times with a power fist.
---
What  I  don't get is why, why  is there caps on anything in this. Why can't I say  I  have  1002  pieces of 10mm  ammo,  and just have it do a  1  to  1  conversion. Why does  it have to be  16 pieces or 340 pieces (I  am using random numbers here). 
---
There is obviously an arbitrary value placed on all ammo types. Why can't I just simply select the  amount between 1 and 1002 and just  have that  value of whatever 1 piece of ammo may cost multiply across however many I choose to convert. If I  go over the other arbitrary  cap of  credit, stop me  from  converting that much and tell  me to reduce my quantity that way. Though I think that max credit  limit is  pointless too, if you're going to let  me  rinse  and  repeat to my hearts content  anyway.
---
Have your character walk almost naked down the main roads where higher levels are. Wait for the "Hootin' and Hollerin" effect to kick in after 10 minutes of suggestive emojis and you're for sure going to get things raining down on you. üòÜ
---
Eso also has a lot more to draw from for dlc and other content
---
It's been forwarded on to the team.

It's pretty complicated to address.

Hey, are you on pc?  I have a bloodied pipe rifle I could sell you.  I know pipe rifles aren't the best, but they are "half decent."
---
I got to play the event once last night and died just as the event completed. I got bumped out side, didn't get to loot the boss or anything else. :(
---
Is this since the last update?  Sorry to hear, but yet good to know other people are noticing.
---
Except we've had quite clear fails in these atom shop items and Legendary Run things for ages now. At this point its clear there's a problem both on the dev side and management side.
---

---
I identify as a ground based vertibot.
---
You craft it as a workshop item. Under the floor decor category. Same with the meat pile (those are the only 2 plans I've gotten on my 5 runs so far haha)
---
No i just like a game that has more viable build variety which rn is absolute trash
---
Sadly I think the only way they could make things truly exclusive is if they were achievement based, or extremely expensive.

True though it‚Äôs a shame about not having head lamp mods. And I believe the vines stay on even with other paint jobs? I saw a YT video on SH and when he switched paint jobs the vines stayed.
---
Didnt think of that. Whelp, back to the grind
---
It happend one other time but i shut my xbox off right away and it was fine. this time not so much but im at 91 and should be fine with the double points starting tomorrow
---
You get free ammo if you only buy one at a time.
---
Get yourself a power armor set, or at least a chassis, added strength and damage resistance. Just be sure to keep an eye on your fusion core's power. A Combat knife would probably be an easy and cheap form of attack too. Don't try to cover the whole map at your level, once you find enemies are too strong and an issue to defeat, start grinding areas nearby that offer good xp but don't have you dying each fight.
---
Doesn't she actually just note "someone" will probably drop one nearby due to how many psychopaths are dropping around the region? I didn't even drop one personally, like you say that would be evil just to retrieve a keepsake, it was some other nutty 76er and I just checked it out after.
---
There's literally nothing I ever want to buy.

Has your area been affected by power/network outages recently, and who is your isp?

It is the apocalypse.

Forgot the perk names but get the create 40% more ammo at tinker benches and find more in containers if you have them
---
Beacause its so much fun to go to endgame events and have people one shot everything
---
Because it will, and always has, only apply to Dailies, not Weeklies.
---
It‚Äôs only for the dailies
---
Side note, public PC servers. Consoles are still waiting. Should be the next couple days last we heard
---
I thought it would be in game for some reason.
---
levels are completely pointless. I have 18 level ups sitting there for no reason.
---
Buy 45 for caps, sell cores for caps. I've amassed a lot 20k 45 ammo in a short period of time buying ammo from players. If you've got heaps of caps start spending
---
oh. well that sucks.
---
So I just completed this for the first time today. I have to agree with what is being said here. As soon as we killed the boss you had to run like hell to get out of the mine, I dont think I even looted the boss or anything else. I was so lost in what I was supposed to do, I thought I would not complete the quest if I died down there. It was a ton of fun but  I agree there should be time to loot and look around down there....
---
Set the fusion cores to the sort of conversion rate you want to have for .45, then sell them for it. If you think 30 .45 for one fusion core is reasonable, set them for 30 cap price and see if people buy them.
---
The lack of any apparent testing on some of these items is quite disturbing.
---
I have one from July 3rd and uploaded it [here](https://easyupload.io/rle0g7). I believe it's the last version before the author deleted it from Nexus. Download should be available for 30 days.
---
Meet a person on here the other day. There friend convinced them to do a bloody build it's there 1st time playing and the friend offered very min advice for there build so they just hit 50 and have to rework there character completely iv been working with her to fix it but damn does it suck, pry done over 20 queens with a level 48 when I met her and she's now 61, which is good but damn am I burning ammo, killing the queen.
---
What you really want is free for all mode. Everyone goes in solo and you only have yourself to rely on. No grouping allowed.
---
90% rad reduction
---
What console are you? I can craft you a fixer if you want
---
VATS has been broke for awhile. 95% to hit is basically meaningless. Something seems to be interfering, I have no idea what though. Straight up shots at close range will miss three or four times in a row, but awkward jumping shots will hit. Seems to happen more with my lever than handmade. Also happens reliably when first loading into an area, even though manual aiming has no issues. Also you'll see damage numbers appear as if you hit, but no damage is registered on the mob. And the gauss rifle is a whole other ball of issues. But other than that, its all good.
---
Tell me about it, I have 43 or something close to that. I don't open my card packs either because, apparently, they decided to add a mechanic that will fuck me over in the future if I do. So every time I need to change 1 card I have to press all the extra shit to say no. It's annoying as hell. Sure, the Legendary Perks system using existing cards would help with all these extra levels. But by the time it comes, I might as well start fresh because my lvl 230 will miss out on many points.
---
A mole rat shouldn't be level 100. Like, ever.  I really hope being level 100 is just a cosmetic thing and it only has like 125 heath instead of like 1,000.
---
It's a weak nuisance critter and nothing more.  I find it ridiculous knowing that there are even a Nuclear Winter variant that had 800 health.
---
It‚Äôs fine I can go buy one I just would like to naturally get something good lol
---
Ha.  Haha.  Good one.  I needed a good laugh after a long day at work.
---
I‚Äôd like to see Vault 76 cosmetic items added, just not in the Atomic Shop
---
Like someone said already just go for 2 star for now.  Double your chances of getting something good. It's hard to get the last star that makes a G-d roll.
---
Send me a PM.
---
Yeah, it has some problems and the rewards are pretty meh.  
---
Once the boss is down I loot it, any and all corpses I can find that are lootable and then fast travel to a team member at the mine and I still get the event rewards.
---
It does keep the junk on you as you're still part of the "event" as the time expires. You get everything except whats in the trunk if you don't make it out.
---
My plasma go fast at 40 and my fushions typically 30
---
So I just did it today for the first time, there were 4 of us, I am Lvl 357, there was a Lvl 117 and the other two were like lvl 40 or less. We completed the quest and it was hard. I didn‚Äôt like that you immediately had to run out of there to get clear. I never got to loot anything I killed in there due to lack of time.
---
I write my numbers down from my inventory to refer to when i convert the ammo. I also just drop any .38, syringer, and 5mm ammo i get.
---
"hey this is useless! lets add it!"   
---
"hey this is useful! lets throw the idea in the trash"
---
I gave up using it because the UI is so SO clunky.
---
So yeah, anything that makes it usable would be fantastic.
---
Nope got a plain old 3 star....
---
Yes. WAIT.    
---
Many quests have a guaranteed gear drop and those you should wait till 50 to complete. That one Ally guy in the leather jacket gives you one as well. Even if you don't use these you can give to an alt somehow, sell, or script.
---
Well I guess they could be supplying it because sales in those items are high.
---
I like to help out anybody, including lower levels, especially with events they're on (Powering Up Poseidon, defend workshops, etc).
---
However, my friendliness tripped me up today. I had Monongah Power Yard claimed just for the purpose of meeting the dailies. A guy who was 1 level lower than me (in the mid 200s) came into the workshop, I waved and continued with what I was doing. He drew out a gauss shotgun or something (except he was firing about 10-20 rounds per second) and turned me to ash. Then he came to where I respawned and killed me 2-3 more times, making sure I had no chance to recover the loot I'd yet to put in my stash (that'll teach me). Then he had the balls to try to sell all my stuff back to me. I wandered off and he didn't even claim the workshop, just left it in my name. Then he went and found another member of my public team and did much the same thing to him. To this guy I say: Up yours, all you cost me was a couple of hours of aluminum farming. I'm not going to get rustled by it, it's just a game. If PKing is what makes you hard, so be it (and I feel sorry for you).
---
Fuck the ammo converter if that's the case let us just scrap ammo into materials
---
You seem a little tense bruh. Maybe take a pause on the game for a little.
---
If not in the atomic shop then where?
---
Put her on Herbivore and stuff her with relish and lunch boxes. There'll be plenty of levels to fix this mess. It's horrible to hear about someone get that screwed early on. Bloodied is not a starter build for sure  Happy to help if you're on PS4.
---
"It'd be a shame if something were to happen to the mine entrance"
---
Wow, I'm only a lvl 18 or so, and I am drowning in all types of ammo. Admittedly, I have a sniper build, occasionally swapping to a shotty or revolver when the situation demands it, so I am not eating through ammo as I rarely use automatic weapons.
---
Do enemies start turning into bullet sponges around the mid 30's then? (and should I start stockpiling ammo now?)
---
This happened to me two weeks ago.  I was level 10 and was doing the Leader of the Pack Event because I needed a wolf blood sample.  There was a player who was lvl 104 who was doing to event too.  They did most of the work but I tried to help out as much as I could.  After it  was finished, I had to drop some things to fast travel back to my C.A.M.P  Shortly after I made it back the lvl 104 followed me to my C.A.M.P.  They motioned for me to pick up a sack on the floor.  Inside it was three legendary weapons an ax, a mutant slayer pipe pistol, and some other type of pipe pistol(all lvl 10), and all of the stuff I had dropped to be able to fast travel.  I thought it was so nice of them to do that for me.  They didn't have to do that.
---
That makes sense but the best part of the converter is that you dont have to worry about people not wanting ammo. If people dont want fusion or plamsa cores then you can get ammo out of them. It may be best to juat stuff the cores into nother character because hording is fun.
---
There is already a solo mode option, you have to uncheck the auto fill box for teams.....
---
I‚Äôm not worried about the coffee in my kitchen, I‚Äôm worried about the dead wendigo in my garage.
---
I like the challenge of fighting multiple people but I see the need for this
---
This bug plagues me constantly.   It‚Äôs a huge fkin pain
---
Events, shops, quest rewards for Davenports daily or any other Vault 76 dailies added in the future
---
Yes. And to top it off for me a new bug has been Radiation Rumble in power armor i turn ghoul in 2 seconds flat when I go to get the ore. Thanks. Sucks. This new update for me has been super wiggy with things. Just little things you notice when you play. Nothing flat out 'explainable'
---
Same . Check out vendor with alot of ammo. Port over , spend 3 caps , quest done.
---
It‚Äôs horrible design when players have to take notes on their inventory to use the converter without getting frustrated or annoyed.
---
It dropped for me again at Queen of the Hunt.
---
Nah we are on xbox and strangely I went from playing with my friend to a growing group of like 12 people. Everyone has mics and just bullshits about stuff and we do all events that pop up and run queens and encryted alot. It's nice actually successfully completing events like rad rumble and project paradise with all 3 creatures Alive. It all started when some greifer with a bounty went around killing people so I showed up in my strangler armor gat plasma explosive and made the griefers leave the server. The guy was another high level sent me messages thanking me for dealing with him and what not and sent a party chat. Since then we have just started growing
---
Final word is better.
---
Queen is just about immune to explosive damage by the way.
---
That's about where this was.  I can't remember the exact spot but it was somewhere around Whitesprings Lookout past the golf club.
---
Thanks for being so quick in the response and for the tip!
---
It's the hardest gun to learn mods for because the drop rate for the mods has been bugged since launch.
---
I'm wondering how they would manage the ammo values if they switched over to a vendor-like system.
---
It's not possible to get decimals and percentages smaller than 1 of whatever unit of currency any given vendor is using, so they're going to have to probably increase the max amount of points you can hold by a ton, and make certain ammo types worth more than one point per shot. After all, a 2mm EC round should be worth more than just a 5mm round.
---
Takes a licking and keeps on ticking
---
The queen is resistant to explosive dmg so i would go with the first. Since the other is reduced weight you can use the other to take out the additional enemies she spawns with the bonus of the weapon not being cumbersome.
---
It‚Äôs in my stashbox. For some reason everyone‚Äôs fishbowl is in my stashbox. I can‚Äôt find anything else. Please make this stop
---
I did not know this. Now I feel better for completing my weeklies too early the previous time as well.
---
Yeah, I agree. I have no problem with legacy weapons, as long as they were obtained through legitimate means.
---
This is also what I do. Low level maxed out pipe rifle.  Easy to find ammo with great stats and I just love that at some point around level 13 or whatever they have to honestly contend with themselves on whether to drop that trusty level 1 pipe rifle for something that doesn't break so fast or hold out just a level or two more.
---
Just happened to me today. A dick stole my double shot gun without paying anything. I should have reported him but I panic logged out.
---
Give me all your loot and start fresh for the next 300
---
Sometimes they end up standing around for a while after their owner logs out.
---
I love my b gat plas because of the dmg and the ammo is super easy but .50 cals look cool and sound amazing along with being absolutely rank killers
---
I rocked a 10mm well into my level 20s.  Realty wish pistols we're viable in the endgame I love the 10mm.
---
Radiation Rumble was the event that made me aware of things.  I have gone back to my 33% hit chance gatling for now.
---
From vendor? We're you fast travelling or just chillin somewhere?
---
Nah, that doesn‚Äôt even phase me tbh.
---
What IS kinda fucked is that we get her all that closure and memorabilia of her father only to then basically turn her Dad into a rug afterwards and mount his head(s) on a log.

Hey bud ... Guess what I found??

My issue is that I have tons of cores on my main not my alt and my alt is my PA build.
---
yeah. just happened to me for the second time. I was waiting for a good time to remodel my camp so i guess this is a sign that i should do it now.
---
&gt; And: Do. Not. Cash. In. Scrip. Rewards. From. Legendary. Run.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Bank all of those so you can spend a ton more during the Sale.
---
Ah damn, I hadn't even thought of that.
---
I‚Äôm with you, I have a bunch of characters I play on. Any more I don‚Äôt play that much because I‚Äôm not going to keep track of the progress Ive made on the legendary run for each one. Just losing interest in the game little more with every upgrade
---
Swift is best. Has the higher capacity, and reduces AP cost by 5%.
---
Stinging increases AP cost 10%
---
Values have been datamined,  used to be able to get them on Nukacrypt.
---
I‚Äôve seen collectrons remain behind after the camp owner has left the server.
---
I don't see how. The skills at level 1 are mostly irrelevant.
---
Ohh also, are u bloodied? Just wanted to know if I was leading her in the right direction we got her in a full set of unyeilding trying to get unyeileding sentinel pieces for her, but I told her the best damage output for a bloodied build would be a sneaky build. Oh side not she got lucky as fuck and got a bloodied fixer at a queen
---
Yeah that's very frustrating.   For me, I just noticed this today at Radiation Rumble.  Maybe its spreading!
---
I understand how feel, however i would just rather trade ammo to those who need it. Like when my gf plays she gets all my .308 and 10mm ammo and she gives me all her fusion and .45 and ofc sell all 5.56 ammo with other energy munitions.  Same with food. Essentially i am her npc companion that repairs her armor, makes her chems and heals her when downed. I do all this for mats and my ammo type. Lol its great. My ammo converter is collecting dust essentially a status peice of my camp *fancy-schmancy voice*" ahhh yess ive made my way through the legendary run, it doesnt do much these days but it oets the common rabble know i dabble in dailies"
---
Forest is worth more than Urban.
---
Got lucky as a collector and I have 8 of each.
---
They should just make the ammo machines atom shop items and only buildable in private servers
---
An alien invasion would be awesome but you'd think they would've done it with the Cosmos theme'd legendary run.  We could definitely use more alien weapons, I bet aliens have some pretty sweet rolling pins.
---
It's the first time for me and I REALLY hope it will be the last. Nobody touches my camp! :D Good luck with remodelling, I am sure it will turn out awesome :).

Colossal Problem Walkthrough:
---
* If you don't have fall damage mitigation, that drop is gonna kill you, so use the ledges.  
---
* Somebody should cripple Earl's legs.  
---
* Don't stand in the red stuff.  
---
* Don't stand in the green stuff.  
---
* Shoot Earl.  
---
* Somebody should cripple Earl's legs. Again.
---
* Shoot the Wendigos.  
---
* Make sure to collect your Rolling Pin.  
---
* Put on your rain coat before you leave the mine. 
---
* Have a nice day.
---
Isn't it exchangeable with the ammo converter? Or am I misremembering?
---
Kinda of p2w though.
---
Yeah, but its a nice bonus for those who actually play. Bethesda said chsllenges will be things we do regularly, but i never take workshops, harvest plants, or randomly start building 20 walls in my camp. Bug being rewarded for litreally playing the game, well, would be nice
---
I wish we had player mail, I‚Äôd send so much extra crap to people. I‚Äôm a sniper, I don‚Äôt have to make ammo for days.
---
I would like to just see a simple machine.  No matter what I dump in to it (I don't choose) it just gives me credits.  I then pick what I want and it gives me that.  Simple
---
&gt; Can the key etc be retrieved after that quest has been done?
---
Yep, I speak from experience. Because I completed that quest ages ago, but only found out about the free fast travel recently.
---
Just kill the PA guy in the base (he's usually near the top floor or at the top of the stairs) and the key spawns in his inventory.
---
Wait there is a boss, trunk and end of event loot? First time I killed the boss and took off with out looting. Second time, I killed the boss, and booked it out. Now I have to find a trunk, the boss, and then make it out?
---
Same here. It sucks lol.
---
Thanks guys I meant to say why so lol
---
Well, can I please have my helmet then? Pretty please?
---
I was in my camp building and scraping wall repeatedly for doing daily challenge when he stole the first plan. Didn't pay attention since I thing it maybe a UI bug.
---
I fast traveled and after maybe 15 seconds or so he stole the second item which is my double shot gun and paid nothing. I checked my caps balance then panic logged out.
---
I now pulled the vendor machine power after re-logged :(
---
It's been well known that we needed more end-game bosses and content to do. I think that Encrypted and these are good steps forwards. This one utilizing the nuke component is super good too- more encouragement to go and use that system and a nice reward for it. I just wish that they added a couple of more things to the reward system, but it's decent for what it is. I wish the 'cursed' modifier could be applied to more than just a couple of weapons.
---
I wanna see a proper vault dungeon, with an interesting story and background to it. I wanna see a couple of them, vaults are always so damn interesting, and it was sad to see the vault raid end up so poorly executed. Even just conceptually, there's so much room to do something 'interesting' with the experiments, but it ended up being another overgrown place attached to a poorly thought out system.
---
Edit: I wanna see more nuke bosses too. Who doesn't wanna be able to nuke the mire and have some kind of crazy boss fight with the 'ultimate strangler heart' which controls the entire region, and the various zombies it brings to protect it.
---
He‚Äôs talking about a free for all with no teams at all
---
It maybe against the terms, but as long it doesn't harm users on high levels (like that inventory stealing hack, and damage modifier) this bug is mostly harmless.
---
Ahh okay thanks missed that
---
Naughty player, you are using what is known as 'meta knowledge'. For all we know there is a trade caravan nearby or a small settlement in the areas the map doesn't elaborate on (the region being scaled down to fit a game world), not to mention the fallout drifting to any given place and poisoning the crops and livestock (and people). We also don't learn about the Wendigo's or what Earl has become until we've already recklessly dropped a nuke on what we assume to be a run of the mill caved in mine.
---
Before you do it the implied solution is basically dropping a skyscraper on an egg to  crack it open for an omlet.
---
Which was probably nuked. Witnesses of the event could not be reached for comment to verify. They were likely nuked as well.
---
I was just thinking about this!!
---
They can random spawn anywhere, more or less. I've been ambushed on the road by them before.
---
If any of you wanna trade for it I‚Äôm down. Xb1
---
I wish the timer was tied to when the player looted the body of the main guy. Keep the tight timer for that but give us a chance to loot. Or give us a like 10 second to grab the boss then take off.
---
Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you
---
Honestly fallout 76 really shouldn't be called an MMO at this point. It's multiplayer I guess yeah but it lacks 90% of the stuff you'd expect in anything called an MMO. They're sort of adding to this with daily ops, but overall it's still very much a singleplayer looter shooter. The legendary loot tagging very much tells you that.
---
They have what is now a very unique and fun core base game, but they seem determined to ruin this via shitty QA and daily caps. I honestly wonder if management understands that they are slowly starving a potential jackpot of consumer interaction if they simply removed the caps and focused on QA releases.
---
Being able to turn part-Wendigo (fangs, thinner, claws) visually would be amazing and actually tempt me to make a cannibal character. I like me a good vampire story, and that would be pretty close. I mean obviously we couldn't go the full way for gameplay and story reasons, but it would be cool.
---
Yeah, my thought is they changed how it works from previous quest design in PTS.
---
Instead of looting chest for quest reward ( if you make your way to end room as shown in older YouTube clips), now they granted it automatically once you finish the quest ( or just need to kill the boss? I haven't confirmed this part just yet.)
---
Definitely better change from old quest design. The truck in end room are just random filler, such as stimpak, ammo and some ore.
---
Then don't, nobody is forcing you. Just don't come onto the subreddit and whine that you can't get the pretty skins and costumes. You can live without them. You can play the game completely free of microtransactions and just enjoy the free updates and DLC that others are paying for for you.
---
Again, just don't complain that you can't get the pretty skins for nothing. They exist purely to make money for the game's continued existence and support.
---
Is it on console yet?
---
I think the one thing that is in fact account-wide is Legendary Run. Since unlocks go into atomic shop, it should be available across all characters
---
No capes!
---
Honestly I'm at the point where I would be fine with paid dlc for stuff like advanced daily ops + unique maps but I have no confidence it would hold up to the price charged for it. I don't believe the studio, being run the way it is currently, could produce quality content with enough QA to charge for a proper DLC.
---
I‚Äôll still use them in certain situations. For example, ran two events today. First one I never had to equip it as we had plenty of Dwellers who knew what was up. High level, good guns. Second one......notsomuch. Had myself (320), a 120 and two &gt;50 guys. Took a while (which isn‚Äôt a bad thing per se as I collected so many screws). But as the time hit the sub 5 minutes mark and Earl has only just mutated, I knew it was time for it to come out. Burned him down and booked it outta there.
---
Question is why aren‚Äôt we getting points per Level. It‚Äôs still grind heavy, but we get more points this way and don‚Äôt have to worry about picking a perk card or swapping SPECIALS.
---
Looks awesome man, yes, definitely post some inside shots.
---
I was. That's amazing luck on the Fixer! I'm just whatever until the next patch comes out, running sneaky Chinese suit with instigating fixer.
---
This. You see that some poor woman arrived before you, being munched on by a Wendigo, but it's pretty clear that the other 'gos have been using their little tunnels to drag people inside from the outside, and Earl simply couldn't fit. They have been tossing the gore/food down the shaft.
---
well it's twice in like six months. last time it took me 4 hours or something to fix everything. 
---
it will indeed turn out awesome. been using an alt to test out some ideas. wanna make use of the greenhouse dome.
---
You can launch nukes too, y'know
---
I love the elite ranger armour and similar related sets but aside from that the atom store has just been QA disaster land. I have never seen so much paid content left to die after release in such terrible states in such a consistent way. 
---
90% of their issues stem from them lacking a solid QA team. Like damn just pay them and watch people flood the store.
---
Dont stand in falling debris, stand in acid, bring plenty of ammo, stims and power armor if you run it
---
The timer to leave the cave after the boss dies is really off-putting.
---
It's premium currency, knucklehead.  
---
It exists to make money, the atom store would not exist if it didn't make money. Asking for something that was created to make money for free is just asinine.
---
You want to bring up cosmetics unlockable in game as rewards? I'll totally support that. And Bethesda offers that in 76, almost every event has it's own pool of unlockable cosmetics, hell the new Collossus even drops a bunch of new plans and a sweet new mask.
---
Well, they weren't kidding when they said it had performance issues. I experienced lag issues that I'd never had before, and I wasn't even at the event! The event seems to lag out the whole server while it's on. No idea why.
---
Push-buttons wouldn't work or were massively delayed (like the button to open the security door just inside Fort Defiance), and a couple of times I got stuck in container/stash inventory screens unable to close them for a few seconds.  
---
Everything clears up again as soon as Earl is dead and everyone emerges from the mine again, so the lag is definitely related to the event somehow.
---
It‚Äôs pretty easy, the only problem is if u die after the boss died it spawns u outside of the event so u can‚Äôt loot the boss and get the end chest
---
