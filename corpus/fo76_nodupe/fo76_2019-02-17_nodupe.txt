Golf tournaments between ghouls

---
---
Sure. 
---
That is most generous of you !! I wanna earn it but I’m torn with wanting to fly BOS colors and never receiving the dam  thing in quest !! So I’ll take it much appreciated !! I mean that !! I’ll be on 9 pacific my gamer tag is lostspartan034 !
---
Thanks again 
---
Be specific. Date picked up. They might accidentally add sort by date note was made and that’s no help lol
---
In my own personal experience FWIW I find that there is a difference between charging my GR and then hitting my VATS button (which does not seem to be reliable) and hitting my VATS button and _then_ charging my GR (which does seem to be reliable). Maybe it's just in my head but I feel it's worth trying.
---
I have found them at watoga and Harper's ferry (others too) I have a spare if you are on pc
---
Haha.....yep, been there too! I got 4 mutations the first time, as it was bugged and I had no choice but to just spawn in again. The 4th time I died, I made it into the Bunker.....and died inside in a collapsed heap!
---
Be forewarned that the jetpack eats through fusion cores, so unless you've got plenty spare, consider this before spending 5000 caps 
---
I find all of the keys so damn annoying, same as quest holotapes. Can’t put them anywhere, or sucks 
---
[removed]
---
You mean ghoul officers, not scorched
---
That would be nice, but I think organizing them into NEW would be easier to program into the game. I don’t need to organize notes/ holotapes by weight.
---
It was a bunch of 1* Nocturnal Marine right arms.
---
Yeah. One of the reasons to power up the power plants as you get rewarded with a generator plan for a generator you don't have. So if you run it a few times you get all the generator plans. 
---
This one.

Thanks for the informative post, I appreciate your feedback! I agree with your thoughts that core drain is an intended penalty and I mentioned so in my first paragraph. I also touched on the three points you raised to help my find more cores in my third paragraph, so I'm already aware of those tricks and I've been making use of them for quite some time. I'm not sure that the unyielding kind of build is for me and I prefer using my power armor at the moment because I'm still working on completing my end-game non-PA gear. I completely understand how it could be more beneficial for me to not use my power armor but that's not the stage I'm at right now, so this issue is a real thorn in my side.
---
That has always bugged me about notes.
---
The animation is so slow as well.. 
---
Would be useful to have the option to take the note rather than read it.. especially when being attacked!
---
That is true, but there's a fusion core perk that lowers the cost in general. I use mine regularly, and after hitting up Watoga now and then, never run out of cores. 
---
Two shot explosive weapons.  I feel like I’m the only player without one.
---
I actually haven't tried that one, I'll be looking into it for sure. Thanks for the tip! I appreciate your concern that it may be too hard for me but considering I can beat almost all FPS I've come across on the hardest settings, I'm not worried at all. Glad to hear you're enjoying Metro!
---
I am happy to send it if you want it! Ok me your address or a PO Box or something and I will get it packaged up
---
Mmm a kind soul uploaded several recipes when I made a serious offer of the same kind a month ago before I got my copy. I'll give you a link to the sodas in a moment, have to upload copies. No cap compensation necessary
---
I’m with you. Some of the stuff I don’t care for. 
---
Nice
---
Yeah, I definitely think the bloody/unyielding builds are in a very strong place right now. I'm actually working on getting myself gear for this while waiting for them to fix this core drain issue. It's very strong!
---
Is it just used to sell to vendors? 
---
i can make you one. dont have the flux to upgrade it though.
---
Rubber
---
Glass
---
Plastic
---

---
To make marine helmets (sell to vendors for 31)
---
Ain't all that since the Nerf I think weapons just need to be a bit stronger, especially heavy weapons like minigun Fatman and a slight buff to Gatling gun
---
I’ve seen a Epic diseaseed Behemoth by the abandoned bog town by Waltham 
---
I think what people don’t like is that if you choose to buy atoms with real life money, it is overpriced and atoms should cost less to buy with real money. I don’t personally have a problem with it because I earn all my atoms, but this is what I think is why they don’t like it. 
---
Player level was late 30s, just entered BoS for defiance, two level 40ish people where there as well in full power armor (At this point I had no power armor set of my own, so I thought they looked really cool). I waved hi and they invited me to team up. I had no mic but they still let me tag along anyways using the emote system as best as I could. We just so happened to be on the same quest, so we did it together. This was my first time playing in a group as I've been playing solo this entire time so far. I could hear them communicate with eachother, and I just used emotes everytime I found the next objective/clue. 
---
 We ended up playing all the way through to the glassed cavern, and the glassed cavern was the best time I've ever had in fallout 76. Mowing down waves of scorched in a trio of power armored epicness (I finally got a full set by this point) Everytime we would clear a wave of scorched there were only minutes before another 50 showed up. And fighting the SB in the cave made me feel truly epic.
---
We played a few more times together, doing the enclave events, and finally tackling a Silo (to which we stopped right before the nuke launch because I had to go to school) but I will never forget the fun I had in that cavern.
---
Thanks guys!
---
You might want to check out the youtube video of the curved houses. It would be pretty easy to adapt into a theater as well.
---
I'm fine with just the standard :)
---
Sir or Madam, I thought I had read all of your bug roundups and I regretfully completely missed this one! If I would have known you were on this already, I never would have made this post - and I most certainly would have linked yours first otherwise! I did check to see if they had placed it on the known issues list and that wasn't the case as recently as last night. Regardless, and on a related note,  I thank you on behalf of everyone in this community for your hard work, dedication, and hours of painstaking research to try and make this game as good as possible. I've read that you're feeling a bit of burnout from all of that and the current situation. I truly hope, for all of our sake, that you continue to do this game and this community as great a service as you have been to date! All I can say is hang in there and know that you have at least one really big fan in me. :)
---
Seems more like a theory than objective data. But i can see where you are coming from.
---
I'm fine with the standard (:
---
How bad is the bloodied power attack drain (either rough percentage or visual difference in gauge)?
---
The interior of Whitesprings is fairly safe, unless you smack a bot. But I can see where low levels might have trouble getting there. And there are a ton of rooms they could open up for us to use. Maybe even make them available to rent. Pay X number of caps for a room with a vendor bot to you can load up with stuff to sell to players. 
---
I want to play there!!!!!!
---
Disclaimer: Just giving my opinion here.
---
I've always considered to be dumb, investing on a cosmetic item inside a game, I mean, an item wich doesn't modify at all your experience, except for the looks.
---
But on the other hand, I can understand, that having those items, it's an open door to "donate" some income to the game devs/company, so it's good to have it.
---
Looking at both aspects, since the items don't give any advantage and the company gets a plus, I concur the atom shop is a good thing.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Regarding prices. 
---
Right now, there are a limited number of items, wich means, if one of those EXTRA GENEROUS players wants to donate to the company through this method, he can only do it a fixed number of times by buying atoms, hence the high prices. If prices were 1/3 like some people comment, I'd get more items, and also the vast majority of players wich get the atoms for free, but the EXTRA GENEROUS players would have even less iterations to buy atoms before they get the full inventory of them.
---
In short, since there is 0 gain from the items, I find no problem at all with the current situation involving the atom shop, except for developing time consumption, wich is always just speculation and can't be confirmed by anyone except the people who actually work in Bethesda.
---
Please don't hate me :P
---
I have a few of them like that. It's so annoying. But I just don't think about it/ Maybe they could use the same script they used to fix those stacks or duplicate keys and maybe make it so you can't get more than 1 of each of those most problematic ones.
---
Do you any over clocking active (esp gpu oc)? If so maybe reboot with default settings? 
---
Yeah, I'll give you that. Honestly, Nuka Grape was a godsend in FO4 survival, but the lack of increased disease vulnerability when taking it lessened the impact for me in 76.
---
It is certainly better but still have had a couple of disconnects and two or three infinite loading screens that required restarting the game when trying to fast travel and that has been experienced in a fairly short amount of hours played post patch.
---
Sorry to hear about your experience when you tried bringing this up yourself earlier! The internet can be a dark, cruel place sometimes. Sure, it might be a function of the game that's working as intended but it certainly doesn't feel that way! In any case, thanks for the comment and let's hope this gets addressed soon!
---
I'm using a quad ES GR and I have to target with vats, then charge but i can't hold the charge i have to shoot right as it hits 99 charge or I'll always miss even at 95% hit chance.
---
That's what I had in mind. Enclave Hideout and places like that are safe, but not necessarily accessible to everyone. Vault 76 just really makes sense. 
---
welp I added you just waiting for you to sign on.
---
I found the plans in the flooded train yard near watoga. They are in one of the train cars near the tower with the safe. You may need to server hop a few times to find them.
---
Thanks.
---
I found marine plans there yesterday and accidentally took them instead of server hopping (:
---
Oh, I won't be on for another 2 hours. I'm sorry (':
---
I agree with your point of view and wouldn't mind if it was changed to be that way. My thoughts as to why they decided to go about it this way are that they needed some form of balance check in place to ensure that PA VATS users didn't vastly overpower other builds in the game, particularly in PvP. It sounds like we share our disagreement with how this drain has been implemented and we've both had tons of cores wasted in relatively short gaming sessions. Here's to hoping this gets fixed ASAP!
---
I have a rule of thumb that I keep 5 bulk of all the bulkable things and no more than 100 of (almost) any other unbulkable salable item (some stuff like screws, titanium, ultracite etc are so relatively rare I won't sell the excess). I will generally not bother bulking steel or lead or plastic unless I have a ton of it (which can happen if you have an extractor at CAMP). Since they're used so frequently in ammocrafting and weapon and armor repair it's really not worth wasting the 2 plastic.
---
As far as what the metals are used for: Steel and lead make bullets. Steel is also used in a lot of building materials and weapon and armor repair, so it's good to have a lot on hand. Even if you don't it's literally everywhere in the game and not hard to acquire a ton of quite quickly. Copper is sued in any electronics you'll build at your CAMP as well as some weapon mods. Titianium is used primarily for Excavator armor. Silver and gold generally are only used in energy weapons and mods. And uranium is generally only found as ore which is refined into nuclear material which is then used on weapon mods and explosives.
---
It works on ghouls, today at white springs I could see their arms being crippled. I think on enemies with guns it just reduces their accuracy and movement speed.
---
A data point for the lack of loot from legendaries. I've been playing for about 8 hours straight completely alone on the server. There is no lag and the inventory of the killed enemies show up promptly, inside and outside of nuke zones. Yet considerable number of legendaries have no legendary loot and often 1-50 lbs phantom items. Played mostly in Whitesprings.
---
A separate issue: the Club House did not respawn any enemies during this 8 hours. The last time I met two dozen Liberators, many legendary. The guest houses do respawn the ghouls in 30 minutes or so. Since there is no one else on the server, the club house can't be triggered by a fresh player.
---
Thanks for your input and the  suggestion! I mentioned that I've tried that particular perk in my third paragraph's last sentence. I can only hope this is either an unintended issue or some kind of glitch that they patch soon.
---
lol ok then. just message me then. hopefully i will be around XD
---
Hmm Im not sure I was using power armor all the times, I have the targeting system
---
Okay sis :)
---
Don't be a Dick. Lower them prices! 
---
Both exist. 
---
Thank you!!!!! 
---
Would it work if we drop all but one, turn it in, pick em up, and repeat?
---
Can't wait for more quest involving them!
---
Quest items can't be dropped
---
Well i was just tryin explain to them why/what was going on and what bethesda hopes happens..
---
I think their prices are skewed to make it not nearly as popular they might want or hope it to be.. if they hit pa skins at like 4.99 id prolly own every one of em but at 18 im gonna call a pass on most all of em.
---
I will try this out tonight to see how it looks
---
I respectfully disagree and I'm already aware of what drains fusion cores based on the research I've done on the subject over the course of the past month. I refer you to my third paragraph where I mention the various methods I already use to try and gather as many cores as possible, including capturing power stations. I understand your point regarding my wanting to play a mobile, VATS heavy character, but I don't share that point of view.
---
Charlie has almost no turrets, I always do Charlie. 
---
Aid items are rather common in this game, so the only things worth selling would be canned meat stew, scorchbeast mixed stew, and the cranberry item that boosts xp gained. Most people use pharma pharma to get chems, but people would probably buy calmex, berry mentats, grape mentats, fury, or overdrive.
---
I solo run nuke silos for steel scrap and I'd be happy to help just for the company! If you don't mind I'll add you next time I'm on my ps4
---
You might be overthinking it lol
---
Thanks for the comment! Sorry to hear that your son has been experiencing the same issues as I raised in this thread. I can only hope they fix this as soon as possible so that you two can enjoy doing more than trying to find fusion cores during the precious time you both devote to playing this game together.
---
It would have to be a rare af one cause that can fall under over powered mabey a small negative or just a random queen drop 
---
Im using a medics combat shotgun and troubleshooters pump action. Both 1 shot supers. Explosive shotguns are still OP. Two shot is bad on a shotgun, kills its accuracy. If all 7 pellets land, they die.
---
Teamed up with a level 80 last night,  he helped us kill a punk ass scoarch beast. At one point he traveled to our camp and put up some sweet decorations. Cool dude 
---
This. I did Charlie as my first silo ever and imagine my surprise when I did Alpha next. 
---
my only complaint about the atom shop is that aside from some building stuff, most of the cosmetics are ugly lol
---
I feel like this behavior (and griefing in general) has gotten progressively worse.  Maybe it was simple good luck that I wasn’t dealing with it before or a run of real bad luck that it has been almost relentless over the past 2 weeks but I’ve essentially given up on claiming workshops at this point.  I like playing with house money at workshops to experiment with building and the defend events made for a nice way to farm plans but getting repeatedly killed while trying to do so just isn’t worth the aggravation IMO.  As others have suggested move your camp to whatever resource node you need and learn to build the stacked concrete bunker style base (as I’ve had poor luck with camp getting sacked as well) and you will have a better experience.
---
I had a group of protectrons that would spawn at my old base, they did little to no damage and they were all different colours.
---
I called them the Teletubbies and just sort of let them attack my base, the most they ever did was destroy the door which was like 5 wood to repair so I just sort of let them do there thing whenever I saw them. Thy were pretty neat.
---
Thank you for your comments and the words of encouragement. I forgot to say it in my last reply, but please know that I appreciate the feedback you had provided in your first comment! Cheers.
---
I recently bought one at the Watoga Train Station. 
---
Are you on PC? I can craft the shielded.
---
I had a great Gauss. Legendary too. I spent tons of money to buy the plan and build and scrap them one by one to make it silenced. Cost me a few thousand in the end, as I was buying them from the Enclave to scrap before I found the plan. 
---
Here's my problems with the Gauss.
---
Ammo...it weighs too much. The gun itself weighs too much. It misses in VATS. It takes an age to wind up to 99. So...I sold it. Even after all that money, time and effort, it wasn't worth it.
---
It could be dummy simple you know just flip the switch you get a notif and then business no harm could do with a trader immunity bonus or auto kick griefers for hurting traders during trade times 
---
Not really over powered because 75% reduction on class freak is already pretty good. The extra 25% will just perfect it. 
---
The only problem with that is when your already in an active fight say against a griefer or another team and they take all your caps. Now you do no damage but they can continue to kill you, your friends or your base with no consequences. People who dont pvp shouldn't make suggestions about them. 
---
Yeah man I feel you there I finally got my first good roll after about 200 hours. I got a god roll grognaks. My only problem is none of these weapons feel special and unique. Back in the day those unique guns felt like they were a pet of the world.
---
You mean people of Vault Tec, right?
---
*"There's nothing I want, and it costs too much!"*
---
This is... Kinda hot???
---
Sorry forgot to mention I'm on xbox
---
Prime receivers deal the same amount of damage as a hardened receiver and require ultracite ammo to use. The upside is that it deals bonus damage to scorched, and can also be applied to weapons that don’t normally have the hardened receiver, such as the gauss rifle or crossbow.
---
It's the same as the normal super sledge so far as I can tell: about 7 power attacks = about 12.5% of a fusion core (one tick of the core gauge, why they made the gauge out of 8 ticks instead of 10, I can't say).
---
The way I found out was by starting a SBQ fight with about 12 fusions cores and getting the "Low on power, get out" message after about 5 minutes of non-stop power attacks when she landed. Needless to say I just use my .50 cal or regular melee on her now.
---
great job
---
What's your gt? 
---
Funny thing is it was Microsoft’s suggestion when what ever I wanted was taken
---
If you read terminals on the way out it explains why this isn't possible. People dont read lore and complain this game has no content or story. Smh
---
Thanks for posting this comment. I'm the OP of that post and I wanted to echo your input here. Even with the Full Charge perk, I can easily blow through a massive amount of fusion cores in very little time. Sure, it lessens the drain noticeably, but they still die WAY faster than my other melee PA build that sprints and power attacks all the time.
---
i fixed it by placeing the letters downwards :)
---
Cheers
---
Uh... nope.
---
I highly suggest the succulents and fish lamp!!! 😍😍😍
---
&gt;People who dont pvp shouldn't make suggestions about them. 
---
That's a pretty bold assumption there. 
---
How are y'all holding more then one at a time? When I pick one up and already have one it replaces the one in my inventory. 
---
Because we left the door open a little when we left...like duh lol
---
close your legs dude!!!  JESUS!!!
---
This basically summarizes every post on this sub
---
Wait Charlie was the one I did, the others have more !?!
---
I'd be happy with "Gunfu doesn't target characters that have not attempted to initiate PVP."
---
Targeting his doesn't work through walls...
---
Because this game is dying to lack of content and they've got like ten modelers sequestered away making shit nobody wants.
---
Your game is going to die because updating the atomic shop was more important.  Doesn't that make you feel the least bit angry at all?
---
I came to the bottom for a good time! I was not disappointed!
---
I know, but so does the Contractor card. Doesn’t say anything about camps, but works there. It’s a fair guess that wrecking ball is similar. Easy enough to test, too
---
Not exactly. StarCraft servers are still up with zero residual income. It's included in the price of the game.
---
Yes. If you constantly complain about pvp, demand it be removed from the game as well as  any player interaction outside trading or friendliness then no. You don't get to decide how it works. 
---
I'm very far from being a green horn, I'm specced for it, and as a VATS crit rifelman, I definitely burn through cores WAY faster than you can imagine - even with the right perks and knowing all the tricks to farm cores. You honestly can't tell how fast the burn rate is until you experience it yourself or see a video about it. If you're interested, I tried to explain it in my post on this issue here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqxg1u/fusion\_cores\_draining\_unacceptably\_fast\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqxg1u/fusion_cores_draining_unacceptably_fast_when/) 
---
Could you customize it?  If so I would log into my friends accounts and include Scorchedbeasts, Deathclaws, and Yao Gui’s! 😂 
---
I found a bloody level 50 bolt action pipe pistol. It’s amazing. Modded to a rifle, gets pistol damage perks, I can run 3/3 nerd rage and 2/3 plumber and have nearly the durability of 5/5 Gunsmith, with more damage and AP regen.
---
You don't need to be articulate to not be a prick.
---
I guess it’s good to know it’s not just the gauss rifle...
---
It’s been a favorite of mine since operation anchorage so it was a bummer to feel like it was broken. It’s weird though bc sometimes if I move my guy to the left or right it will hit but that could just be in my head too
---
This wouldn't work for me. My buddies often have bounties and more often than not the people with bounties aren't on team as we don't all want to be dragged into their PvP shenanigans.
---
That is good to know. Thxs
---
I'm not sure why it wouldn't work? It currently targets anyone, regardless of hostility.
---
I've had this argument loads of times here and it comes back to the same thing: I've spent thousands of atoms. I still have thousands of atoms. All free. No money spent. There's no need to spend money.
---
I saw a r/gaming post a while ago that was the most circlejerk BS I've seen in ages. It had a picture of New Vegas and DLC saying $10. Then some power armour skins in 76 saying $20.
---
That's bullshit and lies. That power armour skin is free.
---
that is what i do.  i spend a few hour scavenging, while my collectors do their job.  bulk as much as i can.  i will bulk up my stash to 600.  then i wait for my vendor reset.
---
also, check your waste antiseptic.  one day i noticed, I HAD 738 WA!!!!!
---
If I'm not mistaken, Creation Club is kind of a thing where people make "mods" for the game and Bethesda chose specific mods to show if they liked it. (as long as it was sent as an application) Also, Todd had said how the microtransactions would be nothing but cosmetic, and as stealth armor had in game benefits, that would exclude stealth armor from the atom shop in future additions
---
Because if they have a bounty they have initiated PvP, and I still don't want to target them.
---
I just want a prime mod for my melee weapons 
---
That's why I love the munitions factory. I barricade the place with the free concrete walls. If an event to defend comes on I'll move one obsucre wall and then place it right back so even if I die, good luck with the bounty. Nobody tried to break down the walls when I used to play and nobody else could find an alternative solution to get in. 
---
This feels extremely disingenuous, saying that T-51b is the best power armor while it clearly isn't. 
---
Yes it has high ballistic and energy resists but the end game in FO76 revolves around nuked zones and radiation resist becomes pretty important.
---
&gt;Please comment if you're a serious buyer only. 
---
Yeah commenting only because to me this feels like a scam. 7.5k caps for a power armor that's not very good in nuked zones -&gt; end game areas... 
---
Spending those 7.5k caps on mods for X-01 would be a better choice.
---
Don't take advantage or mislead other players... 
---
The others have a *tonne*, Charlie only has a few. 
---
Yabvone...fluorescent flux and ballistic fiber are all I’ll need
---
Why would you spend money in the Atom Shop when everything innthere looks like monkey ass?
---
Maybe you're the prick, because you're not understanding of the issues people have. Not everyone can control their emotions. Not everyone is in a good psychological state. Not everyone can communicate what they want to in the way they might want to at all times. Not everyone has a good life. Some people have been through a lot of stuff. Some people are going through a lot of stuff. If them going online and ranting about something that's frustrating them helps them channel their issues what's it to you?
---
So what’s a vendor reset and where is the waste antiseptic found? Assume Pipboy...? I’ve never seen that so must be somewhere I’m not looking.
---
I did Bravo first, then Charlie. Was a nice surprise that Charlie has hardly any. Made me wonder if it was on purpose or they just forgot them haha. 
---
You know all the atom shop stuff was made months ago, right? It's in the game files now. PC data miners know what's coming out in future because it's already in the game. They don't have 10 people working on it instead of fixes. That's not true.
---
Yeah if the skins and whatnot were cooler, then I'd actually consider buying atoms, but as it is, the free atoms cover the stuff is want. Need more skins! 
---
Wow, good find on the 2nd dragon.  The best I've gotten so far has been a level 20 tire iron that does +30% dammage to super mutants.  I would be tickets poopless with that one.
---
Posting here about probably does nothing if you care you should report it to support
---
I mean, in the current patch, you'd still target them. This is more of a solution to when you're fighting the Queen, and Gunfu snaps to some stranger in power armor minding his own business, and not the scorched mirelurk queen that just spawned on your face.
---
shit, also, from a lore perspective, if everyone is dead who the hell is promising a bounty.
---
Yeah i have a bunch of fiber now and had a bunch of flux saved for this but didn't know the decon shower i made used all fluxes.  I'll have to check what i have and send you a message.  I won't be home to play for several hours but I'd appreciate it whenever we can catch eachother on.  Thanks
---
&gt;If you constantly complain about pvp
---
I'm making minimalist suggestions on how to improve it. 
---
&gt;demand it be removed from the game
---
Say what? I think you have me confused with the top comment.
---
&gt;as well as any player interaction
---
Now you're just reaching...
---
Also, this idea that I don't PvP, well that is also incorrect. 
---
Sure! I sent a message
---
🤯
---
You can get them for free??? Go to the excavator place 
---
Where to find this? I'm doing a Uranium fever a lot of times with no luck
---
Everyone that came out of the vault after you was a synth. The only way to be sure is to kill them all. 
---
&gt;  I think the stash and weight limits prohibit people from collecting sets and playing around with different weapons
---
Good point.  I don't even like using space for my non-PA armor, let alone a bunch of different weapons.  Another 200 lbs will help once they add that in the next update.
---
Outfits. They only weigh .10 of a pound.
---
Weightless Chameleon Armour.....please! I only have 2.
---
I don't pay that much attention to the technical data in my inventory I suppose. You can also end up with a good bit before you get far enough into the quest line. I had 7 on an alt and started giving them to a friend of mine one by one but they broke after turning in 2
---
Have you checked the date each time someone comes out of vault 76?
---
Very nicely done!
---
I used it to one-shot an Annihilator Sentry Bot today.  Yessss!
---
You're considered on a team during the SBQ and don't target other players unless the just spawned in. It takes a moment after spawn for the player to be placed in the team but after that gun fu won't target them.
---
Typical raider tactics. 
---
However. 
---
I really don't care if his buddies kill me after I kill the guy with the bounty. 
---
The whole point is to kill the Bountry for challenge kills,,,
---
And to get the trophy. 
---
Dont care about the caps and i dont carry loot during hunts, So Losing a few caps to obtain a bounty kill is inconsequential. 
---
Just as long as The objective is met. 
---
Which means,  either way, I win.
---
I've gone there every time I got on this past week and couldnt find them, I thought I was being mislead lol
---
Or just shittu servers whitesprings crashes almost every time i enter it esp if its nuked
---
You are absolutely correct and I have been trying to tell everyone nothing was solved. They didn't stop them they just took some of the inventory away.
---
Same posts are in the fallout groups and on Ebay for duped items. 
---
But the Bethesda fanboys dont want to hear it.
---
I had 40% "phantom" stored items. There was nothing actually there. It took 3 days to finally go away. So frustrating. Submitted a bug report to Bethesda, their reply? "Make sure to set the Bethesda Launcher as Admin! and check your drivers!", come on. This is SO not my drivers (which were fine BTW), but a HUGE problem on their side. 
---
You need to finish the quest by scanning your excavator armor it’s not just laying around 
---
Yeah, it's not great for groups.  But in situations where you have one enemy that's a lot harder to kill than the others (like a Mirelurk Queen), it's nice.
---
i used stealth rifleman and black powder weapons to one shot most enemies
---
The rad resist on the T-51b is more than adequate, besides with Rad-X and Rad-away there are absolutely no problems.  
---
You are welcome to spend the caps, flux and effort to build any PA you want, just dont come to my post with a shyt  attitude when you clearly dont know what you're talking about or your just pain stupid.
---
What I said is truth, the T-51B is the best power armor in the game and the cheaps of the top three to fix.  I have all the power armors and I'm speaking from a lot of experiance buddy.  But to each their own...
---
And yet, it happened to me multiple times like, yesterday. I don't know if the dude had just got there, but he sure ruined my kungfu flow. :D
---
Wait hold up, if they both exist, why would a regular dude after the bombs fell actively pick up a back pack to walk around with a piece of a nuke code, that’s got to be 50 lbs at least, then turned into a scorched, it makes more sense that they had the back pack they were in the army and then were turned into ghouls 
---
Np I also have some of the BOS officer and knight under armor plans 
---
Just send me a msg when your on GT is Tanaas
---
Yep, that's what I've heard.
---
I use my non-legendary dragon to sneak attack high level enemies for the 2X dammage then switch over to the handmade.  I'm still a weakling with no good legendary weapons.
---
I'm there, too.  I have a couple pretty solid guns for long range and a more rapid fire close quarters option for interiors, but my armor is kind of a mess.  I have a couple really great 3star pieces, but it's kind of a mish-mash of various effects.  Ideally I'd go for a full Vanguard's set with "harder to detect while sneaking" bonuses and pretty much anything as a third effect.  Chameleon is great except that I can't see the reflex sight on my CQC handmade (you can swap weapons and get the sight to be visible, but you have to stay in place).  I prefer to aim and largely stay on the move so as not to be there when mobs swarm my last known position.
---
Some seem to think this is charm school simulator 
---
I'm still good so far just earning my atoms from playing the game too...  have a bunch of spiffy stuff and some outfits.  Saving at the moment though - but I'd like to pick up that new sign soon.
---
i am on PC.  i have noticed, that when i go in to VATS, the first few seconds, the % is 0, then 95%, or what ever the value is.
---
also, i have noticed that when i go in to VATS, if a target is moving rather quickly, the % will STAY at 0 for 4 or 5 seconds.
---
i have chalked this up to, you gotta aim first, and VATS is taking that in to account?
---
I saw they mentioned theyre adding new content? Hopefully this could help for all you high levelers 
---
Wow, that’s on scale with my burn rate here! That’s crazy.
---
Stream Snipe 
---
Please yes!
---
How the fuck does putting a hiatus on the shop and doubling the manpower of the maintence team not speed up Fallout 76's need to get to a healthy state? Write down that bit of calculus on and show your work. We all want to laugh at it.  
---
This game is dying due to lack of content. Without modelers, texture artists, and sound designers, the maintenince team can't add in any meaningful quest content for players beyond giving programming pop-up text boxes. The maintineince team *is* being crippled by the Atom Shop.
---
Same can be said about the game, and I believe they are yes, giving the game away with a copie of the game! Lol what does that tell you?
---
i read a guy data mined the item to see its origin i guess, and low chance from uranium fever,  hi chance signal strength with Rose quest reward but maybe level locked,  and you may need the precursor "resistant" version.  Sounded pretty legit but idk i haven't found it. 
---
Mod, plans, or do you want it on put on a helmet?
---
Yeah that might be it, I'm not to heavy into luck 
---
What is that power armor stand?
---
This was one of the first things I noticed that took me a while to adjust to! I was still trying to use the timing I perfected in fo4 and it just wasn’t working in 76
---
Shit I didn't know that, thanks 
---
collect weapons and armor 
---
Doesn’t the Brotherhood vendor sell all the mods, including the jet pack? 
---
I do I will be in later tonight if you still need it gt: eagle0585 
---
The Grafton vendor in the town not train station always sells them.
---
First of all, relax. There’s no need to curse and freak out over a video game. And it’s Because the people that run the shop aren’t necessarily the ones that know how to code and patch the game properly. They’re lower level in terms of skill. You think everyone working for the game is at the exact same skill level and is able to fix the major issues with this game? It’s just some lower level techs
---
Earlier today, lol. A friend wanted help launching a nuke so I helped him and was looking at the map and there were three new level 1's by 76.
---
YES! Camden Park has ALL the excavator plans for the Excavator PA now. Since the last patch I believe.
---
By the downvotes it looks like people think i'm one of these duping scum, which is unfortunate. I still have high hopes for this game and they are ruining it still. I'm glad some people like you actually have brains and pay attention. Plus all the dupers knew that would be their fix anyway, so made multiple mules to have a stockpile ready. But it's irrelevant as there are people literally duping as we speak with either a new method or the old one which got brought back with the latest patch. 
---
Do your dishes disappear every Monday if you leave them in the dishwasher?
---
lol.  Interesting is one word.  As a sniper build I could think of others.
---
Want a quad hunting rifle?
---
vendors have a cooldown period.  i think 20hrs?  ( some one can correct me if that is wrong)
---
so i will bulk up, go to vendors, sell it.  take vendors down to 0 caps.  repeat at all faction vendors.  then i have to wait for the vendors to receive the 200 caps back (reset).  go do it again.  you can earn 1400 caps each time that way.  add to that events, loot, etc. i can easily earn 2000 caps a day.
---
Workshop PvP I understand.  It’s the camping at train stations to get people as they come to trade that’s really irritating 
---
I'm level 147, have 2 stories, minimalist inside, but 4 balconies, 1 turret and 4 large water purifiers. I see these huge builds and often wonder how they get so big.
---
I wasnt necessarily suggesting YOU. more the community has a lot of voices that don't PVP
---
Lol wouldn’t surprise me if they did
---
Plan
---
 Did you read what I said? Metro is a fucking corridor shooter and is very like COD. That is not a compliment.
---
 Stalker has probably the highest ratio of start to rage quit in any game. Many don't make it past the dogs and the scuzzy bandits will hand you your ass. If you can live with that and play on Master then you could learn to play the game. The environment will kill you with little warning, its just a feast. Its also among the most modded games there are and some of the mods are stunning.
---
this guy has been trying to sell his T51b for a few days now
---
not really
---
I have only just realised we accumulate atoms just by playing the game!! Brb, going shopping
---
I have a T51b for pvp and it really isn't
---
plus if you're mutated, you absolutely need radshield on top of diluted radx.
---
It's more about priorities, they expect people to buy from the shop while the game is not in a great state. I have not played the game yet so only going buy what I've seen on here.
---
yeah i've got an idea aswell, why don't we just ban the wanted player cause that's got the same affect of making the game unplayable, same as your suggestion, make the bounty system so stupid noone even encounters it anymore
---
He's talking mods. You're talking plans. Correct me if I have mistaken 
---
if another player can kill you, they MUST be a duper. only logical explanation
---
I've sold a bunch of the already, you dont have to buy it, dont be such pricks.
---
Pacifist mode prevents a player from triggering PvP, by mistake. My advice is turn it off. At some point a player should have enough game experience to not mistakenly shoot something.
---
FO76 is my first FO game. Once, at very beginning,  I mistakenly destroyed someone's camp turret. I didn't even realize some targets show red vs yellow in my sights. I then played awhile as wanted until someone killed me.
---
Then, once I saw "camp under attack"....fast travelled to camp and started hitting the attacker. Then I realized I am not doing any damage. So I exited.
---
From that point on, for me, pacifist mode is off.
---
If I shoot someone by mistake, I will fight it out, to the end. If someone, attacks me, game on.
---
I do not understand why people complain about griefing when the consequences are so low. It's not like the griefer gets their choice of 3 things from your entire stash, your best weapon, or the armor off your back, when u die. All they get is junk.
---
Yeah I caught that after I posted. Plans are considerably more expensive by easy to craft.
---
Dang-right
---
Then you don't know how to use it.
---
I do not. I never have overclocked before.
---
by pointing out that you're basically running a scam?
---
Ahhh, cheers. I don’t sorry. I have the game completely vanilla.
---
Those who bought the product got it, yes. However, the product received was incomplete because of bugs or defects. And they are quite bad actually. Maybe you didnt encounter it yourself but there are definitely instances of others encountering game breaking bugs. There shld be posts on these even on here. And the fact that bethesda has been spending majority of the 3 months so far patching what shldnt have been needed to be patched after official game release and still trying proves this. 
---
Even with the bugs, I still love it. On a dollar per hour entertainment basis, my personal ROI is in the pennies per hour at this point. Compared to going to the movies...
---
There are tons of fixes that are necessary for making PvP work.  The problem with having a wanted member on your team is you can still see everyone else on the map, so no one can get the drop on the wanted player. This is a serious issue and completely defeats the purpose of having the wanted player blind on the map. It also shouldn’t trigger team PvP. Just a couple critiques. 
---
1)  Explosive bobble gobblers have been stopped. Don’t know if this is true for other types. The high damage they were dealing could have been the result of tons of effects stacking that were probably not meant to stack so high.  I played around with bloodied this morning and got a bloodied handmade to pre-nerf levels of damage and wasn’t even fully spec’d for it. 
---
2). Just because they’re a level 253 doesn’t mean they used an exploit to get there. Some of us have been playing since launch (or even in the beta) and have a ton of time in game. 
---
3). You left off a significant one, the reactive plates exploit. 
---
I keep coming home with pens every time I go out...
---
T-51b costs springs to repair...  T60 is much cheaper to maintain. 
---
By pointing out you dont know wtf you're talking about... 
---
camden park vendor sells all the plans or mods for excavator armor
---
I'd sure pay for a re-spec, same with a larger camp stash box.  
---
The thing bothering me about the items in the shop, is the missing companion pieces like the 1/2 and quarter floors that match the full ones.
---
We can all be "pricks" sometimes. We all have bad days. Sometimes it's good to just let it all out and get it off your chest. Sure the example in your post isn't helpful, it's not fair on the devs who are probably working hard to fix stuff, maybe not the thing that is bugging that person though. Maybe the futility of the ranting about some issue that is way down the list of priorities that it's never getting fixed is what is subconsciously frustrating them the most. People sometimes just need to vent.

---
The funny thing is it can still be fun. You're choosing to make it a chore by making it your part- or maybe even full-time job to complain about it
---
A rather simply solution that might discourage this crap is allow players to go in the red. Remove the minimum cap value and allow people to accumulate debt. Which must be paid to deal full damage to players or structures again. This will seriously tone done a lot of fights. Especially with how tanky everyone is now. 
---
Yeah, the plan costs 7200 caps, the mod costs 264 -- but of course I've spent a lot of caps fast-traveling to Harper's Ferry every day for the last 6 weeks.
---
you can get the same stuff for free by going south of Watoga, hoping server for mods and farming nuked zones for flux.
---
not to mention t51b **is** terrible for nuked zones.
---
That's just so flat out wrong. Sure they're not specialized in programming but modelers are the most precious resource you could have on a team. What's the point on having a dozen programmers if all their projects are in gridlock because they have to beg for 3D models?   
---
 
---
Hmmm now I need a meat hook! (Just did my first attempt at farming mutations) Any idea where best to find one? Maybe I just buy the plans...
---
No. Prime recievers are dumb as hell as they currently exist, and SB are hands down the worst enemy in the game.
---
Making them even worse just to justify the existence of an excessively expensive special ammo is the worst possible solution to this.
---
Prime recievers should just be a flat damage buff, against any enemy, or even better, armor penetration. 
---
I’d like to see skins based around weapon classes, so a golden one for all pistols, where you buy the one for say 200, and a set for a bit more.  
---
On the flip side Armor is such a useless one, I can count on one hand the number of people I’ve seen without an outfit, and who gets 5 pieces of a single armor set?
---
My only requirement is I need water. Found a nice little place just North of Emmett.  Been there for a month. Close to most places I care about. 
---
Super stimpacks!  That was Super nice!
---
With enough charisma and buffs you can get the price down, but yeah expensive. And then requires you to have or get the mats. Modare much easier. 
---
I’ve got a few level 40ish friends that can help but we’d have to do it next weekend if you want us 
---
Yes you’re right, they could suspend the shop so as not to insult people that don’t understand how it works or that it wouldn’t actually help.  And that could be a good move for them in terms of appearance but it wouldn’t speed up the fixes/patches.
---
Go do it then...  stop telling me what i should and shouldn't do you'll just make an enemy of me and force me to tell you to fuk right off...
---
Now how do I block morons on reddit?
---
We'll, I like the game and have been playing since I got it at Christmas time so I say, yes, play it.
---
They aren’t making them anymore.  Make sure you have tried them out before selling. 
---
Unless everyone is going to be showing off their "PvP pass" like I did, it just sounds like an excuse to tell people you disagree with to shut up.
---
You want a mutation that affects other mutations?  That’s just asking for a recursive error causing the mutation to effect itself producing endless buffs. 
---
It’s Bethesda. You know this is possible, and in all honesty, probable. 
---
Besides, some would argue “Class Freak” is already OP, especially given the benefits of some mutations and the fact that they can be buffed by “Strange in Numbers”. 
---
This has only happened to me a couple times, and not since early January.  I have a 100mbs internet connection, (Which I largely use for working at home as a graphic designer that needs to send and download huge files often and promptly) and usually I just get a bit of lag after the SBQ with up to a minute to load all the loot from the meat piles that I largely have a full list of loot from as a melee/PA garbage disposal unit.  My sniper, who focuses on the SBQ 99% of the time while crouching on top of a building, has no delay in looting the SBQ and perhaps 1-2 other scorchbeast corpses that I helped get rid of.  
---
I think the main issue is a failure of the local provider to transmit as much data as the game requires while in an instance that's populated with at least a dozen other players, dozens of RNG piles and more enemies populating the instance regularly as new players pop in.  I'm sure BGS purchased top of the line servers to support a AAA game with high aspirations, but failed to realize that most players may not have access to top end connectivity for various reasons.
---
I have 5 characters, each using a different build
---
Melee/grenades
---
Heavy weapons
---
Shotgun/rifles
---
Full-auto rifles
---
Pistols
---
I made the pistols character last, and yes, that's because its the hardest combat type to play. It's particularly bad since they reintroduced the reverse-damage bug. You hit enemies very fast for small amounts of damage, but the health bar climbs back up just about as fast. You end up running out of ammo quickly.
---
You need *furious* for your fast-firing auto pistols, like 10mm. You need *instigating* for your slow ones like pipe rifle.
---
This build survives if you do it right. But damn, it's hard. Worst weapon category in the game, and the only one that uses Agility. It benefits from VATs the most, but you can't VATS because those cards are Agility, which you're already using to pump up your pistol stats. 
---
Have only lucked out finding the calibrated shocks mod once but I keep checking.
---
Must be nice. Every time I’ve tried the perk card “shares” then about a second or two later drops off and I’m not sharing anything. 
---
I commend the level 57 for leaving the newbs alone and engaging someone who consented to PvP.
---
For me, the primary reason for claiming a workshop is for the awarded plans. I usually get more than enough  resources outside of workshops.
---
If I claim a workshop with the goal to obtain plans for purified water, I could care less if someone takes the workshop or kills me. 
---
I'm still waiting for that Ghillie Suit.. I'm up 5.7K atoms and counting.
---
Got room for one more? Don't really need the caps, but dealing out justice sounds good.
---
i tried the laser rifle.its pretty awesome but only fires about 15 shots before breaking..havent used the gauss yet...keep dropping the ammo cos is so heavy...is there a perk that reduces the weight of the 2mm ammo?
---
If I had a head set, I'd be way more willing to play with others because easier to communicate what the combined goal is.  Most the time I'm just going around collecting screws and lead and trying to farm the elusive double shot weapons but hard to communicate that to others who might have a different goal.
---
It’s definitely not this as I recently cleaned the dust and did a clean OS install. Everything was working fine until the latest patch. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions though, this was the first thing that came to my mind 
---
Why did your game crash 5 times? Were you attempting to dupe?
---
It’s not wrong. They’re not modeling all this stuff as we speak. All this atom shop stuff was already created before the game even launched. They’re releasing it out a bit at a time to the store 
---
Watoga train station bot, Phoenix (BoS), and I think Wallace (Harper’s Ferry) have them. 
---
Before you sell bear in mind they have indicated they will be buffing energy weapons.  
---
It doesn’t always crash, it’s quite random but it’s really annoying to have to hard reboot when I want to play the game 
---
Anything... the atom shop has been borken for me now for several patches.  Items dont show up, just blank squares with titles and prices. 
---
Different teams but the company has one pool of money and it decided to allocate some of that money to the staff doing outfits for the Atom shop. The idea that one doesn't effect the other is false as they actively employed modelling and texture artists over programmers and quest designers at some point in the games development. 
---
If you cannot get it to one if your other characters, sell it or trade it.
---
I mean I would buy it, thank you. Shouldnt be a problem you have to fix, but I do appreciate the sentiment. 
---
He's right. Most people I talk to in game are on the sub reddit.
---
That's on PC atleast.
---
A lot of them have reddit just for this game, which is really weird to me. 
---
Bethesda is valued at almost 3 billion dollars. They have enough money to pay both. The pool is huge.
---
Is it worth something? I thought the idea of it was cool but I also enjoy smacking ghouls in the face with the Blade of Baset 
---
Bah No worries!    
---
  
---
Just wanted to let you know it was captured and reported, and to be honest, the more people reporting the issue, the better!  
---
I'm just trying to consolidate them to make sure we have a Catalog of issues.  
---
Ummm.... wow, thanks!  
---
Taking a few days off from building these before I do Environment, player, and a few others needing attention..  
---
Figured a little time off between the pages would likely help me keep from pulling my hair out!
---
I noticed once it would turn off everytime I would move
---
Me too.  I love them dearly. And my different floors.
---
Care to explain then? Because I cant find a single thing saying it can.
---
This is truly what the Fallout franchise has turned into.
---
We went from Boone’s story, Mr House, Caesar, the vaults, Nellis AFB, Black Mountain, Old World Blues, Ulysses, Honest Hearts, Dead Money... To this fucking garbage.
---
This is sad, if anything. 
---
My PS4 name is JARRRRIO we’re 3 people, and happy to help
---
buffing the durability or buffing the damage? cos my laser rifle already does sone good damage
---
Ok (note that xmp mem is over clocked, and some gpus come with factory OC's). The only time that I have had the game crash without warning was when I had a bad memory configuration... (Or if the GPU is drawing too much power, but that does not seem likely on start up) sorry if none of this is helpful.
---
They can easiliy work around it. They can use the same coding for the class freak perk and count it as a perk or do some other things.
---
They undersized the main dev team at an earlier stage in the development of the game in exchange for increasing the size of the Atom shop staff. I agree that throwing people at the bugs now won't produce much as the damage was done by earlier decisions around the Atom shop.
---
My bad, I thought you meant trashing as in beating the crap out of it and liking it. I meant no insult! I’ll definitely be checking out Stalker, though, thanks again for the heads up!
---
That’s fine!! I’ll try my best, any advice I can get helps..
---
Not yet. They say their are adding new content soon.
---
&gt;ou'll just make an enemy of me and force me to tell you to fuk right off...
---
please, anything but that. oh, no.
---
I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just warning people this is a scam.
---
I don't know why this is getting down voted. It is just giving you a tutorial on how to find what you are looking for on the Inter tube.
---
You're a moron.
---
Imo, the atom prices are fine and I have bought nearly everything I want without spending real dollars. However The converted atom to dollar price seems high compared to other games.
---
If they did this for 4 I would he in heaven 
---
I have Headlight Bright on head. Tesla Coils on torso, Calibrated Shocks on legs. Hydraulic Bracers on arms. Works pretty well for me.
---
This. Is dupers need caps they’ll just dupe Nuka-Colas. 
---
Batteries Included is the perk you want. 
---
prove it
---
I agree. I have not experienced any disconnects since Feb 14. Also, game/server seems more stable at "moments of truth", like engaging multiple opponents, several, quick, controller button pushes, etc. 
---
Now players need to get to a point where our decisions and execution, completely determine the outcome. The server should be "invisible".
---
We’re they stacked?  
---
Send me inv, psn same as here. 
---
Is it explained in the game why they are there and who made them? I don't remember seeing them in 3 or New Vegas but not played those for years 
---
Yess, only solution I know of from experimenting, wait around 3-5 seconds before firing after acquiring a 95% display.
---
You know how if you try to fire immediately after vats'ing in, even at 95% you'd usually miss with most bullet weapons?  It's like the Gauss Rifle suffers from that only more severely, wait at least 3 seconds before firing in vats, if you miss still then wait 5.  It's like vats hasn't properly adjusted your aim.  I have an explosive gauss rifle, so let me say it's frustrating when you vats fire at a ghoul completely unaware of you with 95% accuracy and you see the bright flash of your explosive shot veer far off to the upper right.
---
And when you click and hold too soon after releasing the trigger, you end up charging up a blank shot cause when you release the trigger nothing happens.  Need to time your trigger pulls.
---
And if you don't want to fire a charged shot, holster your gun, pull it back out, display sits at 99 instead of the usual 00.  I actually kind of like that though lol.
---
I love the Gauss Rifle, it's *my friend*.
---
Seconded. I have 7 mutations.
---
&gt; A Real Blast
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Difficulty: Moderate
---
&gt; The difficulty comes from two parts: one, while you're activating the satellites you might get attacked, the worst are the mole rats they spawn like rabbits and gank you,
---
I don't know about you, but I'll take mole rats any day over Yao Guai on this event.
---
Twisted Muscles and Slugger work on Chainsaws???
---
Never seemed.ed to work for me, either 
---
I always wondered of Revenant works on Chainsaw damage
---
im soooo with you on this one!
---
BTW: this game seems to get a lot of glitches if you memory is not 100% stable... Maybe try a cold reboot (power down for 10sec and reboot) with default settings (if on PC) and see if the problem persists (idk, but may be worth a shot)
---
Usually I shoot people once to check and twice to ensure they're aware that it wasn't a mistake. I don't have ammo, weapon condition, or time to bother goading people into it
---
Yea I’d be interested to hear from someone for whom it activates...
---
If you don't mind, what's your character's Charisma score?
---
I like a lot of the content fluff they put in the shop so far, so I am not someone that has any issue with the items. I'd like to see a lot more and a wide variety of items and types also. 
---
But I do think the cost of unique items and a lot of the items that are retextures is pretty high for what you get and what the item actually is.  It is a twofold criticism from me. I think the cost of items per atom is too high AND I think the cost of buying atoms for how many you get for real money is really really really terrible. Like for a simple icon avatar, it should be more like 5 atoms instead of 150. For a floor retexture and bedcover retexture, 150 not 450-600, an outfit like the vampire and starlet 600-800 instead. Making paint jobs for armor and PA, they should be paint jobs for all armor and PA types bundled into the item, imho. It might be a higher price point but I think more ppl would be willing to spend for that if they knew for sure they got to have that paintjob for their favorite PA set or armor type. Idk just some random loose thoughts.
---
Honestly, I'm actually disappointed when they populate an area for me.  I find them extremely annoying, mostly because they're difficult to target without VATS as a melee character and have absolutely nothing of value on them aside from the odd red star pin.
---
Why would that matter?
---
If you were being one-shotted every respawn, it sounds like a you issue, not a bug. You had to have been hitting “seek revenge” instead of just respawning, which would immediately flag you for PvP and make both of your first shots do full damage. 
---
There’s no way you were one-shot without retaliating against your attacker. 
---
Spoiled Meat, Veggies and Fruit. 
---
&gt;!People leaving free fertilizer everywhere. smh!&lt;
---
As of the last two weeks I cant seem to start the daily quest "Heart of the enemy" or "Queen of the hunt". This is a large issue with me since dailies are about the only thing I have to do anymore. I'd like to see this fixed asap, I'm enjoying the game but at level 190 and 100 both my toons need these to keep me playing.
---
Because stupid people spend money before thinking and rage after because it’s only their fault.
---
Anyone known if headlamp use increases consumption? 
---
Well, in a way that's the reality. When you have nothing to loose, you're free of laws, which doesn't even exist in a post-apocalyptic 76 world. The bounty system is ridiculous in a lawless world.
---
2 days ago you were asking what a set of this should cost and  you accepted south of 5k, so what changed?
---
I'm guessing you guys aren't teamed up?
---
ok thnx very much
---
Bethesda confirmed that players could *look* at your inventory without you accepting the trade request (which I've experienced) but they could never actually *take* anything. If players *lost* an item it was because they accidentally sold it for zero caps. 
---
They already have the most op gun...
---
This is why I apply an Atom Shop skin to anything I can. You can’t accidentally drop it.  It will prompt you to ask if you’re sure when you try and warn that it will be destroyed. 
---
It only works at workshops, not CAMPS. 
---
I have been getting better offers and frankly my time is worth more.
---
Solo Server?   
---
Damn I'd kill for one of those sometime for testing.  
---
The loot lag has been better since the Outage on Feb 14th, and I assume you're cleaning up your own Loot Piles.  
---
Clubhouse has been known to bug, which is a huge pain when it occurs.  
---
Question, was there other people on the server previously?
---
It was a mod changing the graphics.  Skin works as designed.   
---
Go do it for yourself, I dont need to prove anything to a troll.
---
Have you tried a cold reboot (power down for 10s-1m) sometimes a system can become unstable if not fully shut down for an extended period of time
---
No concessions? I'm out.
---
Going  to try that too. 
---
So I imagine a rug place in the dirt. Then place the mill on it and move both by grabbing the rug.
---
Sounds feasable.
---
There's a throwaway sentence in the Prima guide that says: "It allows you to share higher-point perks and also affects your rewards from Group Quests and prices when you barter."
---
Now, as far as I know, that means that there's an xp and cap bonus on some quests for having a higher charisma.  But, I have to wonder if there's a charisma modifier on the loot tables too....
---
Yeah same here. The only thing I missed out on that I even considered spending money on was the Red Rocket sign. But alas I'm cheap lol.
---
I don’t know what the reactive plates exploit is. And while I’m sure it’s possible someone has sunk I that many hours that they’re level 253, combined with his behavior I find it doubtful. I’ve played since beta and have sunk way too many hours into the game myself, and while I have a job and a life, I still find it hard to believe this person spent over the double the amount of hours I have on the game and then decided screw it, I’m going to grief some people just to ruin their time. 
---
I have a prime receiver on a couple of my best guns, and I only break them out when they are needed such as SBQ fights. It’s very easy to notice the dmg increase they provide and with farming the queen event you can easily rack up enough flux to make all the bullets you’ll need to kill scorchbeasts. 
---
Obviously it’s going to be different for everyone as far as the effectiveness of the receiver and the cost efficiency of using them. But that problem isn’t with prime receivers or ultracite ammo.
---
Not trying to save the day or anything. Im just far past tired of messing with stash limit and it's going in a world container or bag with all the other stuff im forced to drop every day. Yours if you want it
---
Friend request me or Rain.
---
Come hang out, and do some salvage runs.
---
 with us. Help out a few low levels that dont act like paranoid scary cats  when we try to help them, and youre in.
---
We just got a guy that specializes in Chems today. (Our very own drug dealer,  go figure).
---
But we still need a bullet maker if you're down with that. 
---
How to maximize gauss rifle damage ?
---
Can't you drop in from the hole in the roof at the front? Where do you put the walls? 
---
Oooff I scraped this one thinking it was shit 
---
while scenes from the past rise before him
---
Thanks for stopping by earlier bro. 
---
I think I get the same. I'm not wanted, I'm a pacifist. When I log in, I get the landing screen with 2 screenshots, the logo at the bottom right comes in, screen goes black and the game sounds can be heard. It never loads in, but goes back to loading screen, then shortly after I'm in the world proper.
---
Haters gotta hate.
---
isn't spam bannable or something?
---
I'd bet he didn't knooowowoowowowo the gun was loaded either!
---
It'd be great if game design didn't drop the ball in a bunch of places, but they did.
---
It's ammo is heavy...  800 rounds, never again.  Weird how firing the Gauss Rifle can be a method of shaving off weight.
---
If you play this game for years, I think you can hardly resent Bethesda having an additional revenue stream. 
---
Well...aside from the pop-up child labor sweatshops that undoubtedly pumped out the majority of the duped items that went for sale online.  China has a twisted concept of intellectual property and private ownership.  I'm picturing some skinnyfat chain smoker boss in a faux Timmy Cliffhanger tracksuit giving 9 year olds as much meth as they want to stay up for 72 hours straight in a rent-by-the-week converted storage container filled with computer stations and one bare lightbulb in Shenzhen that makes a basic CAMP house look like a mansion.
---
Already thought of that. I block off that room in general. I block every door on the inside. The receiving area, if you're facing the building's front then on the left I block that entry, the upper floor, a room on the upper floor because there's a hole to drop down, and another door leading in to the interior. I literally block every single way in. Had some dude running around the building for half an hour thinking of every which way to get in. 
---
No u can do the in game events and get rewarded plans. U can buy them from other player or vendors too. I think u also get a few for doing the campaign
---
Tse gauss with all rifle perks are good i can pretty much one or two shot everything with sneak multiplier
---
Don't skin it with atom store stuff or you won't be able to sell before taking it off.
---
“You can’t have fun if I don’t think it’s funny because my opinion matters” 
---
They could use the enclave bunker for 50 years or so 
---
I would put it as "weird paranoid bullshit", myself. And even if it were the case, they still aren't putting a gun to anybody's head to buy cosmetics. 
---
Is there a Teach the Teacher course? 
---
Right, they made all the Atom Shop items months ago and just stopped. Because that's how this works. True, the Atom Shop modelers work on shop items months ahead of their scheduled release, but they never flat out *stop*, and this still doesn't change anything about the problem I outlined. Modeling is such a time-intensive task, even one extra modeler is invaluable. 
---
Again, show your reasoning on why a maintenance team for a game that's hemorrhaging players every day from no endgame content is actually better off without any way to create new enemies, new locations, and new armor and weapon types with unique models instead of just talking in circles.      
---
You nailed it! Thanks!
---
Confirmed: the effects stack.
---
Speaking of hoarding.....anyone hoard a right leg? I've been looking for ages, but not found one! PS4.
---
Definitely. If I get hundreds of hours of play out of a single 60 dollar game like I did with division and destiny 1 I don’t mind buying optional cosmetics.
---
I always get bored of Fallout radio after a few hours. It annoyed me when Far Harbor came out that there was no radio station of sea shanties.
---
Workshops. You always get plans for taking control of workshops. It's why I always take every workshop I pass, even if I don't feel like defending it when it gets attacked.
---
Hold the trigger down. It will charge to 99 to give you full dmg and then you let off the trigger to fire 
---
U could do that to a weapon?
---
It seems like more often than not I knock other players to their knees. I think this is the intended mechanic to give you the option to stim them or finish them (or for a teammate to stim).
---
There is also auto stim armor, which the wanted individual probably had. Not sure how that works with stacking the effect (also perks like mysterious savior).
---
As for the one shot only kills, not sure, might be some kinda damage threshold, do enough damage past their total health and they're one shot one kill. 
---
nice
---
&gt;	That said, the internal numbers they have may say otherwise
---
Almost certainly. Also, it's easy enough to lower prices of digital goods, but it's almost impossible to raise them, so it's better to start high and go from there. 
---
That actually sounds friggin awesome, seriously why didn’t they? Bully in the alley.
---
Life's a piece of shit when you look at it, life's a laugh and deaths a joke it's true. You'll see it's all a show keep em laughing as you go and remember that the last laugh is on you.
---
I'm pretty sure you enter that fatally wounded last chance mode where people are able to revive you. But players can execute you by attacking one last time after you've gone into that fatally wounded mode. There is also a perk and some legenderies I believe that has a chance to auto stimpack you when you're downed.
---
Yes. 
---
Fatman:  Aviator Paint.    
---
Mini-gun:  Chrome Plating.   
---
Hunting Rifle:  Camo. 
---
You can also put the Tricentennial skins on the 10mm pistol, Hatchet, and Laser Rifle. 
---
haven't spent any either. Theres stuff i want, but theres plenty of ways to get atoms so not worried about it. Probably grind some up this week so my camp is all nice the way i want it. 
---
Simplest solution is to make CAMPS immune from PVP damage if the owner has pacifist mode on.  
---
Thank you, good to know.  Mostly everyone gets Nuka Cola paint.
---
It tells you that it needs 10 power and even shows that it's not plugged in after you place it
---
If you're in pacifist and have reactive plates (50% melee damage reflect on melee attackers) you trigger as wanted if your plates kill them. Which if they are running a bloodied/unyielding build they will easily kill themselves making you wanted.
---
I think music is more expensive than it seems, because it involves complicated legal agreements. Some old games can't get re-released because of expired music contracts. 
---
fish lamp is unironically my favorite item that i've gotten off the atom shop, it has the most detail out of anything. everything other than the blackbird power armor skin has been way to quirky for post apocalypse 
---
I only bought 1 thing with free Atoms, and that was the Cammo skin for my PA. I'm only mad that I can't use it on my new Ultracite armor.
---
And if they kill you and claim it they get an already setup workshop.  I personally like when I stumble upon an unowned workshop that's already been setup by a previous occupant.  Considering how much junk you can go through fortifying a workshop, it's nice not needing to build the place up yourself, and you can usually see new ways of fortifying places sometimes too.
---
I dont know, I have a bunch of these td in my stash. When bored I grab one out, drop it and pick it up to trigger the quest. 
---
Might be because I picked up a whole bunch before I triggered the questline though. I still have about 20 in my stash
---
Find a Exterminator legendary weapon. Gives you 30% extra damage against bugs and Mirelurks.
---
I'm interested to know what that damage threshold is, beyond which no revival is possible for the opponent.
---
Auto-stim armor works only for low health but not zero health, no?
---
Boy oh boy does that sound fun
---
Yes, but I nuked them out ;) with a triple hit on Whitesprings and they probably left because nobody could launch any nuke on that server for like 3 hours.
---
Btw., there was no increased radiation from the triple nukes and the spawn was typical with mostly 1\* armor loot. Also the silos were odd. I had to do 5 of them because once one leaves, the whole process has to be redone. I did Alpha and Bravo first, then launched from the 3 and went back to the other to find this out. I managed to launch the other two within 30 minutes. Surprisingly, the turrets were all gone after the first visit to each and the robots were all 50+ with way more Assaultrons and Anti-armor Gutsies, true for the rest of the day.
---
Anyway, collected 90 legendary loot total during the 14 hour session.
---
cause people think you need to own everything in there.

I found both the brick and barn sets from claiming workshops. And the small letter signs. 
---
Also happens with two shot rifles 
---
I currently have all but 3 mutations, I can tell you that ...
---
1) plague walker does not exactly "proc". What it seems to do is have a continuous aura of poison damage that only affects hostiles (no players or venderbots), This aura is only up when you are diseased. I usually have 2-3 diseases being that i'm usually 60-70% irradiated just walking around and i hear it affecting mobs on floors above/below me (like the last ghoul/glowing one in the bowels of the golf house).  \*\*\*i have yet to see any animation for this effect
---
2) Electrically charged: looks like an electrical shock wave emanating from you (looks cool), damage is mostly irrelevant, only time it even is noticeable is on single digit mobs and i have never noticed it stagger anything. for an example of proc rate,.. I 1-2 hit every mob in the golf house and it will proc about a dozen times in one clearing.
---
3) Unstable Isotope: The proc rate for this is MUCH less than electrically charged, about 3-4 procs per golf house clearing. damage, pretty negligible, many things in the game do not care about rad damage (even players). The visual though is awesome, like a super mini huke popping off with a sudden bang.  My buddies verbally if not literally jumped when it procked near them for the first time.
---
\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **electrically charged** WILL aggro robots, i have not had **unstable isotope** proc onto a robot to see if they are affected, and i know **plague walker** does NOT proc onto robots.
---
4) Carnivore: works on raw and cooked meat (Mmmm, 20% glowing steaks). ALSO, it does not negate any of the "processed foods", aka, anything without an expiration is good (i can assume vegetarian is same)
---
Hope this helps out a touch. 
---
I really want to get some items in the Atom shop, but the amount of atoms I get in the game have slowed to a trickle.
---
This os great! I absolutely love photo mode, I spend alot of time in it. They really need to increase photo capacity.
---
Ooo that's kinda cool though
---
using a revolver and im missing multiple 95% in a row too... am i just that unlucky?
---
Yeah you can sell mats on market76. If you really like caps, you can make 7-8k in around 3 hours with aluminum/lead/steel farm and burn it on whatever, chem serum and all the mods or camp plans. I been busy jumping workshops to get the last of the camp plans (so close) but I do that instead of level. I'm happy with my perks right now, no need to grind.
---
I read yesterday there's a demand for rubber, might serve that up too when they increase stash size. It's a guaranteed thing cause no rng. At your level you could hop the enclave vendor too. Find the best time and clean up on the jetpacks (but no xp), mat farming is way faster. I'm 215 here.
---
My advice is at the edge of the map. The west side is good, somewhere in the middle, so you don't have far to travel, cap wise it'll save you. My thinking behind location is this. You have water for purifiers, and being on the edge of the map, you only have one side to protect from attacks. Also being middle of the map means only low level will attack.
---
I’m not sure as I didn’t get my first two-shot until yesterday. But the downvotes are probably from people still bad about the entire TSE thing. Either because it was OP and they didn’t have one, because it was duped, or because it was nerfed. 
---
Have noticed the fish only swims when it’s turned on??  I’m so easily amused.....
---
Maybe for some people. I don't give up though. And since I set it up I know how to shut it down too.
---
Soon, my friend. PvP Mode next month and new PvE “Wild Appalachia” content coming very soon. 
---
I've had thee repeated issues with the stashes.
---
1.) No longer showing up.
---
2.) Only one cap.
---
3.) Empty. Though that may be from me reloading into the game.
---
It doesn’t exactly tell you tho. When I first started I build a bunch of water purifiers after I found the plans and waited forever and never got any purified water. Until my friend finally came to my camp and laughed asking where my generators were. So I build generators and kept waiting. Then my friend came back and laughed because I didn’t hook them up. Once you know it’s obvious but the game doesn’t make it easy learning it early on
---
id probably make a whole build around that outfit if i need too.
---
yeah its the fact no enemy's poss a big enough threat to warrent there use. 
---
Yeah it doesn't work right, same with herd mentality.
---
Then you are killing my endgame. Rude. 
---
Was at my new camp location building couple assholes came along and killed me. 
---
I had just logged in. 
---
No workshop claimed.
---
No wanted status on me. 
---
Didn't hit him back. 
---
 Respawn and go back to what I was doing. Kills me again. He had a whole 50 cap bounty. Breaks a few of my walls. Bounty up to 75. Whole thing is bullshit. 
---
But it restores AP and not the crits, and it doesn't make noise for me but I think it does work. I'm a heavy VATS melee and in nuke zones and I've been swarmed and it seems like I can kill everything sometimes not getting out of VATS and others no. So I think it activates but doesn't make a noise, although that would help!
---
Outfits, responders police outfit and cap, paramedic outfit, surgical mask with asylum green outfit and hat, still searching for all of the outfits in fort defiance, hope to find a red or pink one.
---
Also, chems and alcohol, salt, pepper, spices, silver and gold scraps, and stealth boys, all to sell one day for decent prices.
---
theres auto stim armor that stims you back up if you drop low and theres life saving gear which has a 50% to auto-stim you when you go down, they also turn invulnerable during this (which is quite funny if they also run last laugh, since their attacker will die to the grenade but the self-revived person gets up unscathed)
---
Because it's still a full priced game with a cash shop and people are tired of that.
---
Really not that hard to understand. I also spent nothing in the cash shop but at the same time I spent none of my atoms too because there's nothing I like in it.
---
Also make notes easier to read.  Some of them are fine,  others have small font on very messy paper hat makes it nearly impossible to read. I’m sitting 4 feet away from a 55” TV and I still can’t read some of them.
---
same here.
---
sounds like he might have been cheating. I've killed sentinel players before and it wasn't that difficult, more difficult than normal but not like they recieved no damage per hit. 
---
BTW PC or ?  
---
Sounds like you were close to bugging out the server, with the silo issues your reporting.  
---
Usually see that on one that is a little unstable, and the fact no one joined your instance...    
---
Skimming your drop rate, quite a cluster of raider there, couple other clusters but nothing super crazy, but interested to see a breakdown later
---
Live radios....
---
still mad the gold skin is only for the .44 while the western has the same model and better base stats / mods.
---
I AM THE LAW. &gt;:) 
---
They have a blue pill that will give you a hardened mass
---
if applying to the workshop youre in (factories are great for this) i always make a save room in the top floor office with hundreds of bookcases blocking the path there
---
i agree. bounty should send the dealer into crippling debt, sending them into the negatives as far as -25,000 and pay out the full bounty to the claimer. negative caps should have a stacking debuff. each prior effect continues to apply until the debt is repaid. Pacifist mode can still be enabled. 
---
\-1 to -100: PVP encounters net no junk or caps from the loser (unless it is you who loses, then debt gets bigger), even if a teammate kills them
---
\-100 to -250 :  workshop item repair/crafting cost increase +10% to +50% - your items can be broken without wanted penalty 
---
\-250 to -500 : Weapons and armor degrade faster by +10% to +50%
---
\-500 to -1K : -10% to -50% damage done and 
---
\-1K to -5K : Aid item effectiveness reduction (ALL types, food, drink, chem) -10% to -75%
---
\-5K to -10K : NPC enemies will only drop spoiled veggies, meat, or fruit. Caps if the NPC normally can drop them
---
\-10K to -25K : Crippling Depression - arms are broken, health drains slowly. healing factor negated during effect. effect stops at 1HP
---
&gt;!some of these may seem harsh.. but to be fair. if you let it get that far down, you deserve it!&lt;
---
I’d rather get snake bit, die, and at least have a chance at a better game after .
---
No hope here. Full tedium ahead.
---
Fair enough mate.  
---
It's working for me... I'm constantly over the weight limit which constantly drains my AP, i use VATS all the time, i need AP,  so it's not hard to notice it when it triggers. 
---
I exclusively wear a ranger outfit with a campaign hat and patrolman sunglasses.  Got the set back when I was level 6 or 7 and now I'm at 37 or 38 still wearing it.
---
Suddenly I now only get a few ammo and maybe a stempack. 
---
Yea it’s the AP bar I pay attention to...never seems to get refilled for me and I’m spec-tactic for vats build...my beta toon seems to have several things that don’t work for him
---
The only downside I've really noticed with two-shot rifles is hip-fire accuracy. Sighted, i have made long distance shot, no problem. But almost impossible to hit a mole rat at my feet without aiming down the sights.
---
So is Activision/Blizzard. With the money WoW had raked in over the years and having a successful year of sales that you’d think they’d have the money to *not* fire 800 employees, some who have been there 5-15 years, but they did.
---
so the fact they are forcing an ill concieved notion of pvp down our throats, that some people don't like means those people should shut up about it? Thats arrogant. Everyone is entitled to an opinion on a game mechanic that affects all of us since you can't opt out of pvp, all you can do is opt out of defending yourself or accidentally attacking others. 
---
Are you crazy? Could you imagine how shit whitesprings farm would be if suddenly the entire server was full and everyone came to farm cause they got a notification. The lag alone would break the server and even if it didn't most people wouldn't get a single hit.
---
Way more emote wheel options for more fluent communicating for teaming up/teams, and trading.
---
And nuka girl themed stuff.
---
I was really nervous about losing my stack of over 900 screws.
---
Harvested them legitamately through scrounging, dont use PA though. Waiting for the day I can set up a shop for those that can use them.
---
I figured they would be worth more than gold one day, if only I could find the right buyers
---
I remember reading somewhere that they were sent to help boost morale for the Chinese troops invading the us and to spread propaganda 
---
Ps4
---
Lost Kind
---
 stash box carry weight not showing current carry weight. I put in a bunch of stuff and still showing 301 when actually I'm at 285 lbs. 
---
There is an issue with VATS % and energy weapons oddly seem doubly effected, still testing but I have a theory its related to the projectile type 
---
also interested in that. looks better than the standard yellow.
---
The anger is mostly from people who want cool shit at reasonable prices because frankly, if there was any amount of decent stuff you wouldn't be able to buy it with just the currency you earn in game. I've got ~250 hours on my account and I've earned maybe 4.5-5k ish atoms... That's gotten me the blackbird PA paint (which I don't even use because you can't put it on the excavator armor... wtf bethesda) a house tile and a few other small house things. The rest I'm sitting on waiting for something decent to come out. Been waiting for months and nothing. The other stuff that's on there that I'm semi-interested in straight up costs way too fucking much money to reasonably purchase with real money. If the atom shop had decent prices I'd probably have spent 30-40 dollars in it by now. If it had shit so fucking cool that I couldn't pass up, I'd spend money on the prices as is. The way it currently sits, it's mediocre shit priced like it's vintage 200 year old wine.
---
Read about all the perks and decide your build instead of just playing and picking perks like "oh that sounds good" 
---
See here's the deal, yeah I also got everything I wanted from the shop for free... but that's only because there's hardly anything in there worth a damn. There are a couple things that I think are neat and I would pay for **if** they weren't fucking ridiculously priced. I might even pay for the exorbitant prices if they had crazy badass stuff. But they're too far on both spectrums, mostly boring shit at prices worthy of high end hookers.
---
Actualllllyyyy, there's a random event of 2-3 lvl 50 gutseys that are named "prison guards." They think you're an escaped inmate and just try to kill you on sight. 
---
I love this idea though. Higher the bounty, more robots they send after you. Killing them increases your bounty too. Almost Skyrim like
---
Yeah, please do. I got it all figured out, but will need some dps assistance with the queen.
---
Yeah, give me an add and let me know. I figured out the silos, but need dps help vs queen.
---
Yeah check out this site for planning your build. I actually kinda knew about it early on though but the sooner the better.

---
Eh, still not very compelling reasons to believe they are exploiting. That behavior is fairly common in my experience. It is cetainly not necessary to cheat in the current janky pvp system.
---
Most camps can be fully repaired in one click with a handful of basic materials. It's not a big deal. 
---
Second shot usually misses in vats.   From my experience.  I got not numbers for you. 
---
I haven’t spent real money either, but the fact is that a power armor skin is twice as much as real DLC content was for earlier games in the series. That’s just patently ridiculous.
---
I don’t mean to say it is necessary to cheat in order to exploit the system, it was really just an aside. I agree it’s possible he didn’t use any *other* exploits. 
---
I fucking hate those little bastards.
---
My character builds a nuclear powered, military grade exoskeleton from tin cans... can't fix an air conditioner.
---
Yes it looks like the hot rod 
---
Do Leader of the Pack event if you see it. You'll get some low level legendary items.
---
Do Workshops. You get xp, caps, plans, etc.
---
Get Contractor perk as soon as possible if you want to do Workshops.
---
Do Powering Up Poseidon like 3 times to get generator plans.
---
Look up Caps Stash locations. And get Cap Collector perk in Luck at level 16.
---
For Luck perks like Scrounger, Pharma Farma, Can Do, Cap Collector, etc. you need to press "Search" to proc the effect.
---
Fallout new vegas wasn't the only game in the franchise
---
&gt; Bethesda didn’t just pluck these prices out of the sky.
---
Yes they did... Even if it was an educated "plucking". There isn't really anything else like fo76 with a cash shop like 76's. There is a hefty amount of micro-transaction based games, but few of the ones that have gouging prices like 76 also cost money to buy the base game. 76 combats this by giving us a small-ish amount of atoms for free, and it works while there is very little that interests your average player (a PA paint here, a deco item there) if they ever start putting in any real amount of badass paints and deco, people are going to get fed up real quick with the prices. They shouldn't have put in nearly as much free atoms as they did and just brought the prices down. As I said in another post here, I'd have already spent at least another 20 bucks on atoms if **both** the prices were a bit lower per item and the items were more compelling.
---
Combative little garbage person aren't you?
---
No, it is. Perhaps you have a basic camp, but one of my favorite things in the game has been building up my camp and getting visitors admiring it. But even camps that aren’t particularly advanced in won’t be able to repair with one click if you have a farm, particularly with rarer crops like melons. I literally spent an hour gathering the materials I needed to rebuild my camp, and luckily I already had flux saved up. This really doesn’t sound like a design problem to you?
---
For me it's not really hate, just disappointment.
---
While taste is subjective, I can't help but go "bleh" at most of the stuff in the shop being bright bubbly and colorful. It's just not for me.
---
Then you start talking about how they just randomly decided to start having "flash sales" along with stuff that's only there for a limited time. Couple that with there being no indicators that there's even anything like that going on in the shop without actually opening it up every time you log in.
---
There's also the topic of how much the items in the shop cost atom wise. Unless it's changed, as I understand it the price conversion of real world money to atoms is something in the neighborhood of $1 = 100 atoms. Which for a lot of people, means that you can't help but look at something priced at 2000 atoms as $20. So you start asking yourself if you'd really spend that much money on a cosmetic. 
---
Even if you don't do that, there's also the angle of having to spend multiple hours/days playing the game to earn enough to get maybe one cosmetic skin. So you would have to ask yourself if it's worth spending those atoms you just spent all that time grinding for.
---
The ultimate cherry on top for me is the lack of skins that apply to more than just one armor type or weapon. I personally don't feel like spending what was it, 1600 or 2000 atoms for a chrome paint job just for a minigun.
---
My two cents.
---
That's two big problems though. Your poking fun at the absurdity of the sentiment, but ultimately what that person is saying is, "Currently there is nothing here that I want, but I worry that when they finally do put in something that is totally badass the price is going to be half as much as I paid for the game!" Which frankly is a very valid worry and comes from a place of forethought unlike, "hahaha look at these idiots complaining about a system with multiple flaws."
---
Odd...must be my toon then
---
You can start by posting web platform you're on.
---
My endgame is hanging around in my assassin/sentinel/cavalier armor waiting for some asshole to grief my camp. 
---
Sounds good.  How are they getting them? I see them in the Enclave for $19K.
---
This game, like every MTX game, operates on whales. It's a well known and documented thing. The vast majority of players will not be spending any money in the cash shop, but there are a couple of players who want super tricked out bases and those players make up for the 95% who don't spend money. That's why the items are individually priced so high, to make more from the small player base that will purchase regardless.
---
&gt; level 253
---
&gt; obviously having used the leveling exploit
---
Makes me discount everything else you’ve said and write you off as a whiner, sorry. I know plenty of people legitimately level 200, 300, and even 400+. The game has been out long enough that frequent players can easily get there. If you seriously see someone who is level 253 and automatically assume “exploiter” than your problem is deeper than you think.

---
Also keep your mic in and on- and talk to people you encounter- if it's a lower person see if they need help with something. If you see someone doing a quest or event you are doing using your voice to say "hey I'm bored toss me an invite if you wanna romp around together for a bit" is a lot more effective than just random team invites. Posts like yours can help but you have to say if you are ps4, xbox, or PC. Also if you toss out your gamertag so people can add you you will see better results.

Here you go, my friend. Be sure to let us fellow Nuka Nuts Know if it kills that Nuka crave

Thanks.  I've seen powering up Poseidon, but haven't tried it yet
---
No we were teamed up that's why I thought it was weird. The only thing I could figure out was I was wanted by accident so I had him kill me. So maybe that was the problem. Hoping when I get back on later it'll be better. 
---
Hmm, this seems like really a minor convenience.
---
You can solve this by simply having a pen/pencil and some paper next to you and just write down the amount before you craft.
---
And why are you crafting ammo for multiple weapons? Don't you have just 2 weapons that you specialized in and use regularly?
---
I use my handmade and the minigun and a super sledge most of the time. So I only make 5.56 and 5mm. Everything else I just scavenge; when I have around 1200-1500, I start using it to kill common mobs. .44 is currently somewhat useless; the snubnose .44 hardly does any damage, but I haven't maxed out the pistol perk.
---
Sounds like you missed some quests in the main story line. &gt;!Should be able to start the quest by following the overseer's journey and before enclave. However I believe visiting camp mclintock (spelling?) Or fort defiance should trigger it.!&lt;
---
ZzmrnewbootyzZ if you're on Xbox! 
---
Someone messaged me and said to go to abbey's bunker, so I think I did skip around a bit by going to the enclave first.
---
And imo that is an issue in itself. There should be plenty of compelling items in the atom store, but there's only a handful. There are a couple hot ticket items like the blackbird PA paint, succulents and a few others that I hear repeatedly being bought but outside those, the rest are pretty niche items. They're really missing opportunities on paints. I want to paint my Excavator set and frankly the best paint job that's come along is just a flat black with some red highlights/trim.
---
I think there can be something to be said for Rarity. If everyday people have to pick and choose, and only take the ones they really like ... otherwise it's kind of like going to the prom and all the girls are wearing the same dress
---
Yeah that might trigger it as well. Could have been where I first started the quest line.
---
Show my reasoning? What TF are you talking about? I didn't say anything about time better spent or how valuable a fucking modeller is. WTF are you doing trying to push BS arguments onto me for? Idiot trying to argue with shit I didn't even say. Shows how bad your point is that you're so desperate to try and push a point of view onto me I never had or expressed.
---
Here you go... and a great walk through...

---
But you still get a reasonable amount of XP, don't you?
---
And the number of mobs is high so you can get plenty of the materials to make stable flux.
---
Seems to me to still be a good location to nuke; the number of people who swarmed to White Springs whenever I nuked it seems like a clear sign.
---
Yes it attacks anything in sight but yourself.it does no damage to your friend tho. I'd suggest to take out the turrets,they are budget heavy and the petclaw can handle anything,unless you camp in the mire or bog.
---
Other pets,such as mirelurk king,have a friendly "mode",but deathclaw and megasloth are always angry lol.
---
You can pacify it in your camp when you have friends over.
---
Finally pet usually spawn and roam around the camp device,so you can easily decide where you want them to patrol.
---
Just posted a link for you, gives you a complete walk through...
---
Did you read the post? lol
---
That's interesting. What did you spend most of your time doing after level 150?
---
 You play on Master because the scaling is stupid simple. The lower the difficulty the more damage everything takes. So on Master everything is far more fragile, you included. ;)
---
What's unyielding gear?
---
Had this happen with three freinds eventually a 4th person got on the server and asked us if we knew what was going on we didn't even notice 😆
---
I get plenty of use out of them during the queen event. The prime receiver also increases the max dmg on some guns and decreases the weight at the same time, that’s plenty warrant to use them for me, on a few guns at least.
---
Cool, bye. 
---
I'm on PC and occasionally it's just me on the server.
---
Is there a way to quickly check to see if there is anyone else on the server? I just scan the map, but I might miss a player-dot.
---
Ohhh!! OK good to know. I built my base up in the tree house and my camp device is up top and I was surprised that he would roam around up top lol. Now I know I why. I want a mirelurk king!! That would be awesome. Thanks for the tips. 
---
Be sure to drop all but 1 Technical Data before you start that quest.
---
Most people have a bunch and they all combine to 1 once they find the place they can turn it in.
---
Had I known, I would have dropped all my technical data except for one, and started the quest, immediately turned in my one technical data, and then pick the rest one by one to turn in.
---
Pvp is broken and guides high level players towards being wanted. I'm level 220 (legit but apparently you wouldnt believe me on that) and it makes more sense to get a bounty then it does to legit pvp.
---
Consensual pvp (I shoot you and you shoot me back) I lose 220 caps each time I die. If I choose to destroy a wall in your camp I get a measly 10 cap bounty, which is less than 5% of the caps I would lose normally. "Dont hate the player, hate the game" fits pretty good here. It's a broken system that needs an overhaul 
---
Its a Perk Card, i cant recall the name of it, but its one that i picked up early on and to me its been a life saver.
---
Isn't the T-60, X-01, and Ultracite better?
---
When I come across a workshop whose owner forgot to power up the extractors, I destroy everything. I should earn a negative bounty for my efforts.
---
Serendipity, under luck
---
A few different outfits depending on how I feel. I always have on bottlecap glasses and surgical mask though.
---
I'm currently using the BoS engineer outfit with welding helmet. A common one for me is weathered asylum hat and outfit too. Goes well with the mask and glasses.
---
I have some I rarely use atm but also go well. Longshoreman outfit with yellow slicker hat, responders paramedic with asylum hat, medical goggles with science scribe looks great.
---
I had 25 when i first got the quest. didn't know it ate all of them until I turned in. Was super pissed. 
---
 Turn on your mic. I got the 'Make a Friend' achievement today. That's on my second char who is level 55. I have 108 levels altogether. ;)
---
 Ran into a guy in Whitespring Station who had his mic on and I was pleased so I started a conversation. We took of for my place, I never fast travel and it was a long way. Got killed by bears and generally had a good time and made friends. Hung out at my place for quite a while and I had to do RL shit and he had stuff to do. We may go do Belly Of The Beast together and that will be a first for me. My other chard farmed the Glass Cavern. ;) 
---
A lot of settlements were wiped out by raiders, super mutants and scorched. 
---
Now with the scorched queen dead and Rose calling in Raiders from out of state while also encouraging us vault dwellers to reproduce(literally so she can raid us), I would imagine future DLC would bring in people. 
---
World seems so dead with only robot vendors. It's such a shame how this game was such a flop :( 
---
They knew the game would eventually be flooded with bots that farm and those would be our human NPCs 
---
They wouldn't have to deal with a story line that most players don't care about. How many people have you teamed with that don't haven't listen to the overseers holo tape?
---
Same here. lost at least 25. 
---
It’s okay, I believe you. 
---
T51 has the best ballistic and energy resistance and is cheaper to repair, it just has way lower radiation resistance compared to x01 and ultracite 
---
If you didnt get wanted for destroying camps people would just roll around griefing and trashing camps. You would have to do a no wanted for damaging camps but no repair cost if destroyed by a player or something to mitigate the harm of jerks being jerks with no consequences. 
---
Don't believe so but anthing that have bonus dmg resist/dmg against scorched should work.
---
Def an upgrade
---
Fallout Boy? Sugar, we’re going down swingin’...
---
You have to go there before camp mc Clintontok else the next quest after camp mcclintok doesn't progress.
---
I don't get why you leave and can never go back inside. It's so dumb. No fallout has EVER done that. None. It's so stupid!!
---
The armor is pre-war, it would just be called Riot Gear if it was brought to the game.
---
I have no problems with the shop, as long as you play actively getting credits is easy. In two weeks I racked up 20 bucks worth of credits and while some stuff certainly isn't worth what it is, it feels nice to Flex sometimes. 
---
I think *some* plans can only be rewards for events on the map. Some also only come from treasure maps (power armour I believe).
---
Anybody have any other experience with this?
---
You can look at your social tab (I'm on console so I don't know what the command would be to bring it up) and check recent. If you are logged on  for the first time that moment it will only show what players are there I think.
---
They should just have a contest where bands make and submit songs for them to use and then put the winners in the new dlc. Give the winners a special power armor skin and bam- tons of fresh music to use and a better game experience for players and all at low cost and effort.
---
Happens to me to, especially late at night it will be either just be me or just me and like 2 other people. I love it. 
---
I think hunting for the dots on the Map is the only way to tell if your alone or not.
---
Go to one with a new character and see if it's repeatable with that one too 
---
The perk cards!  I thought they were a pain in beta because I didn’t know how many of a card I had and would double up.  I wish I would have made better card choices.  I abandoned that character around lvl 60.  On my second character, she’s lvl 135 and I feel I’ve done much better with my selections.  
---
It's funny you mention the civil war suit and ritual mask, I like to pretend I look like Elias from Ancient Magus Bride lol
---
If you pay 5 dollars for a virtual door you're a rube.
---
Fyi instead of repairing crops you can manually scrap them and get all the materials back. Your plants are never gone 
---
I think those bracers only affect unarmed damaged not melee weapons 
---
I downvoted it for being unnecessarily condescending over a perfectly valid question that many people probably didn’t even know they had to ask. That’s just me, though.
---
AstroTurf floors fuck ya 
---
Yeah I've found those soil / water stations all over the map but they just say they are busy or something. Will be a future quest I'm sure.
---
Lol I want to slap myself on the head. I actually already had the plan learnt from somewhere and didn't realise it...
---
It's weird but hell we had great time 😂
---
Its pretty bad balance wise. You need to have other things to choose from rather than this, but if this were a mutation everyone would pick it. No downsides to it.
---
Google it or someone else can tell you but it's useful 
---
Oh and if you wanna lvl fast get a radiation suit and ask a friend 2 carry you around whitespring
---
Thanks.  The perk cards make things so different then fo3, fo new Vegas or fo4.  I assumed I got yo keep all the cards in the pack.  Do I only keep the one I selected at level up?
---
By the way. Good Doggy perk will totally change how you view Dog Food.
---
There is one but it's abysmal, maxed out is like 7% pen if even that
---
It is objective data though, you can get around 100-150 atoms a day from daily challenges, if/when you burn through the initial stockpile, it could take weeks to save up for a single item. 
---
Of course they could always add new challenges for a steady supply of atoms, but I think the concern is why would they when they can just make you pay outright for the things you want.
---
Ah, strange. Thanks for the tip!
---
Because you paid $60 for a game, maybe $80-$200, that is objectively an incomplete, broken, waste of time at the moment. For Bethesda to ask $8-$20 for SKINS, like it’s F2P Fortnite, is pathetic. They spit in your face as a consumer constantly, how do you willfully ignore it? For a game that sucks at that!?
---
Based on a machine translation I found, the text right under their eye calls them "Drunk Dragon Needles," it's not exact, that was just the coolest name based on the individual symbols.
---
Buy the building sets.  Not worth relying on RNG. For decorations.  Maybe wait on RNG.  But I like the brick set the best. So I’m bias
---
I saw a loading screen that said something to the effect that China released a bunch of them to spread Pro-Chinese propaganda prior to the Great War. You can loot Propaganda posters from them occasionally.
---
They're real Chinese robots, Mama Dolce is known to be involved with them in some way. The Enclave just kickstarted their production.
---
And I still think Bethesda should sell plush versions of the Liberators.
---
Hi there soldier!
---
I noticed that you’re a veteran.  The 5th Division of the Reconstituted US Army is actively recruiting for missions to secure and relieve Appalachia.  
---
We’re running missions all over Appalachia, despite the best efforts of the communists.  So far, we’ve:
---
- Investigated suspected communists
---
- Liberated Huntersville from Illegal squatters
---
- Gathered intel from Naval listening posts
---
- Disabled weaponized satellites by destroying their receivers 
---
Among many others.
---
If this sounds interesting to you, and you’re on Xbox one, add USArmyGenDawson as a friend and complete basic training at Camp Mcklintock.  We’ll get you sworn in and issue your weapons and armor at mustering.
---
DIS-MISSED!
---
Gen. Dawson
---
And some can only be bought. One example of event only reward is generators 
---
Hmm, but the legs require springs. They're somewhat hard to come by, and you also use springs to repair most weapons.
---
To be honest, springs are the rare item I'm most often short of.
---
I think T-60 is the best in regards to maintenance.
---
And the Ultracite has the same total amount (621 + 453 = 1074). It just has more ballistic and less energy.
---
They're made from an automated facility started by the Enclave. The factories were already hidden there.
---
somehow it managed to fix its self 
---
There is evidence that the U.S goverment seized their factory at mama dolces in morgantown. Plus loading screens also seem to only be considered the "commonly believed" info lore wise. In fallout 4, a loading screen said the x-o1 PA was post-war despite the game having a pre-war version of it.
---
He's saying if you shoot the wall and don't break it you're not wanted, but if you destroyed the wall you are. This change is being implemented next week.
---
I have found that the twisted muscles negative accuracy effect only applies to vats. 
---
Nice!
---
Paying out full bounty and sending someone into negatives will lead to people making alts, tossing them mountains of grenades, blowing up a buddy's camp a bunch then killing the alt for cash then deleting the alt and repeating. 
---
I always keep some known plans on me for situations like this. Friendly wave and a tour of their house before dropping some plans. Locked house = no gifts but i'll peep in ya windows
---
It's 20 hours after your first trade with that faction.
---
actually not anything would help against queen. Only prime receiver deals bonus damage to her. The 
---
It's vault boy dumb  ass fallout boy is the band
---
Everyone would pick it but not everyone will have it if they choose to make it extremely rare. With Class freak 3 Mutation Negatives are not even noticible for example birdbones decreases strength to -1. Thats not much at all turning it to 0 is not that big of a difference either. It allows min maxing and a reason to play more but its just a suggestion after all.
---
I want more world music.  I'd like to hear more areas getting unique music, and perhaps even faction themes for places that were  the headquarters of former ones.
---
Depends on what ur fighting. If PVP definetely go with AA if not check resistances of ur enemy.
---
you can travel free to vault 76 (upper left) so I pick a place in the lower right of the map to save caps when hopping around the map
---
They don’t have to tell you all that no other company has to bend over that far backwards your not entitled to that and you want way to much  
---
Visual bug involving serendipity icom
---
It is however i don't  think OP here has that perk its a bug that shows up when it procs for others
---
I believe the perk card is the luck one called serendipity 
---
I agree.
---
One thing I've suggested in the past is to add a Borderlands-style "Deal of the Day" kind of thing with a ticking clock that would, conveniently, also represent when the inventories would restock and Caps would replenish.
---
If they insist on keeping this current system, I'd also request that they look into replenishing Caps on a 12 hour interval, even if it is a 100 Caps after 12 and 200 Caps after 24.  The reason being is that if you play a lot in the evening, and plan to play in the morning, you have to be conscious about not running the vendors dry, or else it's going to be a real pain.  This will lessen somewhat when the Stash size gets increased to 800, because there will be more space to put the to-be-sold Legendaries, but until then, it's kind of annoying.
---
I don’t hate you.
---
I believe they wanted NPCs but can’t or haven’t figure out how to have players and npc living on the same server 
---
*insert propaganda flyer*
---
Twisted muscles only affects hip fire and vats.Not ADS
---
I haven't played it in 2 months, and I played the 6 weeks from release before that. 
---
I didn't say it can't be fun, I had just that playing with my friends at release, but having to repair everything multiple times a day when you hardly get any materials back from dismantling got old fast.
---
Most weapons should be viable to use like in previous iterations, but what do we see? 1 Heavy weapon to use, sniper crit builds, and melee. Any other gun has to have a complete God Roll to be any worth it. 
---
The recent update post with announced livestreams has brought some hope, but I'll wait until I see that. 
---
We just can't deny that the game has been in a very bad spot since launch. It needs the Bad game -&gt; Good game finish like FFXIV, No Man's Sky, and Destiny 2 have had before it. Acting like the game is fine how it is now is going to hurt it more than anything in the long run.
---
[*Are you still there?*](https://youtu.be/9NBDulvHYr8)
---
Hmm, yeah it gets confusing if you don't visit all 7 factions when you first log in.
---
Currently, it feels kind of sequential (?) in that it's first Watoga then BoS then Harper's Ferry then Enclave, etc.
---
Unfortunately, I can't quite remember which vendors I visited first last Saturday so I don't know which ones reset first.
---
And on top of that, I'm currently at Harper's Ferry over-encumbered and just waiting for the vendor to reset so I can sell some stuff, lower my weight, and then fast travel to other locations to continue selling.
---
There's got to be a better way.
---
It's not a theory.  The science and psychology of MTX is well documented.  There are entire books devoted simply to reward system that realease chemicals in your brain and how to use games as a way to reinforce that behavior.
---
It's not even new to games in general, gambling has been around for eons.  It's only recently been applied to digital markets of games as an extended revenue stream, and even then there are volumes on the subject.
---
I lock my house because you can’t always trust other players
---
U been banned.
---
I'd say around 2k maybe less. The reasons being 1. they break fast 2. People say they don't drop anymore which is true but only temporary 3. Dupers
---
I have this from time to time.  This morning, it was a server with just one other person clear on the other side of the map.
---
I actually got excited, because I thought maybe this would mean all the Plans would be available for the taking.  Nope.  Seems like this was just an orphaned instance, not a new one. 😂
---
I want the stuff in the shop to not be lame 😕 It could be so much cooler. Bloody chrome power armor? Bumble bee colored hazard sign looking gattling plasma? Oil rigger boots? Naval cannon missile turrets? So much potential, so little cool.
---
But I don’t do anything wrong tho.
---
I've tested the theory, and it's 20 hours for sure, but yeah, writing down what time you sold to a specific faction is definitely laborious.
---
I keep perks like strong back and traveling pharmacy for those occasions.
---
Update on Grahm, saw him just today walking outside my camp. Decided to check his trades, and he had modern CHAIR plans.. so close, but yet so far
---
Every level you put a point in a SPECIAL stat, and you put a point into a card. You also get card packs every few levels which give you some cards for free that may or may not be helpful towards your build. You don't need to choose a card from the same SPECIAL point stat you level up. You can put a point in a SPECIAL stat and then choose a card from a different SPECIAL pool of available cards. If that makes sense. That site I linked will help you plan where you want your final SPECIAL point allocation to be.
---
Springs are rare but power armor takes so long to break I usually have enough saved up to repair it, but I prefer x01 over t51 because of the rad resistance 
---
I absolutely hate those little turds..
---
Why would you? Now I would pay for game stability with caps! 
---
ok  thnx for the info
---
It's Serendipity.  When a player is &lt; 30% health, they have a chance to avoid incoming damage.  When they do, the icon is shown.  There's a bug where sometimes other players see this too.
---
There's a ton of lifetime challenges in the files that are not currently available, and aren't part of the circulation for Daily/Weekly, so they'll likely be enabling/adding more as time goes on. 
---
This. My chainsaw is up to at least 26 instead of the ridiculous 1 damage it started with.
---
Sonos.  Anything goes.
---
No, this is FO76’s client crashing. It should not be happening. Don’t blame a player for bad coding. Game has been out long enough that this should be fixed.
---
What platform are ya on? 
---
The scrap all/store all junk feature. 
---
T60 is the best when it comes to repair costs but pales in every other regard.
---
T51b is the best at ballistic and energy DR. but unless you don't mind chugging radshield and diluted rad-x every 10 minutes, you *will* need X01 in nuked zones.
---
You can earn those building sets by taking and defending Workshops, but it is random.  I'm pretty sure I ended up buying the brick building set.
---
Good job. 
---
Hey man, slot of us dont like the current state of fallout 76 but there's no need to shit on people that are making their own fun, I thought this was funny to see
---
Take is slow
---
my guess would be that they have different amounts of repair, so they aren't truly identical.
---
My dislike for the Atom shop is because:
---
- the prices are outrageously high when compared to prices per amount/quality of content in previous Bethesda games
---
- the timed sales for items requiring high amounts of atoms are setup to incentivize purchases with real money as only so much can be actually earned a day in-game
---
- many atom shop items are just reskins of items already in the game or previously in Fallout 4
---
- some atom shop items don't even do anything, like the xmas emotes just being the same regular emotes with different icons, unlike the preorder Tricentenial emote which has a custom animation
---
- eventually you will not be able to earn as much atom as you will have completed most challenges and the only remaining ways to earn Atom will be daily/weekly challenges, or buying it with real money
---
- 500 atoms is about $5... just a few years ago, $5 in a Bethesda game was A LOT. Far Harbor is a DLC for Fallout 4 that costs $25. Far Harbor brings TONS of new content and 20+ hours of gameplay.  Does it make since for 1 outfit to be equal to 1/5 of Far Harbor? How could this be acceptable?
---
Here here! 
---
And no email
---
I'd like to see them make use of the closed doors upstairs with the scanners (green carpet area). These rooms could be owned for a small fee like workshops and decorated with a vendor bot inside to sell player items. Keeps your camp location secret but able to customize and provide a central place for shopping
---
Maybe make it an end game hub, only accessible after you have launched a nuke. Gives something for players to look forward to when beating the game. Kind of like how in Festiny 2 you can only visit the tower once you've beaten the campaign. 
---
This definitely would be a good stopgap that should be introduced ASAP, though there definitely is more work that needs to be done beyond that.
---
Agreed. I did this several times before with Honey Beasts and Scorched, and it was fine. Then last night I saw Yaoi Gaui for the first, and it was such a pain. My explosive shotgun broke, and I had run constantly to avoid being mauled to death. I had three on me one point and ended up with only a third of my life left after getting caught for one hit from each of them. This was in PA. I'm kind of afraid to try this one again now.
---
This is the absolute BEST idea I've seen about how to deal with these holotapes.  I'd absolutely love to have a coffee where I could replay and/or read what was on the holotapes if I want.
---
Thank you!
---
Death
---
Very nice. 
---
The answer's right now because I pre-ordered Exodus and blasted through to the end just now, got the best ending too.
---
Aw. Too bad! 
---
I'l keep an eye out as well if you're on PC.
---
This has been the last two days for my husband and I. We have been holding all the good workshops since no one can come take them hehehehehehe
---
When you have a series of Perks, such as Gladiator / Expert Gladiator / Master Gladiator, don't be too quick to rank them up.  If you take Rank 1 of each, you'll do +30% damage for 3 SPECIAL points.  But if each one is Rank 3, you'll do +60%, but it will cost a staggering 9 SPECIAL points.  And you can't downgrade the cards.
---
You never know what god-tier legendaries you might find past Lv. 50 which might make you rethink your perks.  Once you feel you have a handle on what weapons are your favorites, then you might consider ranking them up.
---
I actually quite like this idea! I’m very interested in what the raider music would sound like!
---
What do you mean? 
---
Hell yeah that's awesome! 🤣
---
😂😂😂😂
---
I genuinely think it's for the best if they are encouraged to change up there perks more and move away from these one shot builds that will unfortunately plague "survival mode". However I do agree with the limitations of the engine. The engine is absolute trash for the type of game they wanted to build.
---
Yeah, I've been taking workshops all day, keep getting the same garbage plans.
---
They blow up in this event making it not possible to collect any items 
---
But atom shop is free
---
Excavator power armour paints, faction flags and items for camps, more camp building skins (new walls and roof skins) and items (more variation in work benches, etc.).
---
Sounds like a lot of fun to roleplay but I'm on PS4. 
---
Taking Pharma Farma as my first 3 perks was great. I still use it, I love having tons of stimpacks so I can play a bit looser. Ass loads of other chems so I am always buffed for big fights.
---
I would suggest to go with Strength and Intelligence first and foremost. Increasing carry weight and have at least one martial weapon at all times is a good idea (weather you go one handed, two handed or straight fists). The second one will help you build and repair weapons and armor as well allow you to extend item durability. 
---
Follow the storyline, at least to level 10, and you will learn the rest as you go.
---
One other piece, put you camp down in a relatively safe area at first. 
---
I personally don't have any interest in that game. Nor Anthem. Division 2 does interest me slightly but I don't know if I want to pay 60 for it and then not like it much, even though I like the concept of it. The Dark Zone in particular is probably fun for a little while. I think I most probably will get the Division 2. But I don't think I will be giving up on Fallout 76 even then. Even though I haven't played FO76 for a little bit recently. I just want this game to work. They need to add rejoin previous server. I can't play having my game interrupted by some crash, disconnect, or infinite load screen etc.
---
Then someone make it so and take my money!
---
How the fuck
---
Doesn't hunters also work because scorchbeasts are classified as animals?
---
I was in the Army, the field artillery, for 10 years. I'm also on PS4 and always like hanging with other veterans. Feel free to add me to your friends and let's go cause some havoc.
---
You getting owned isn't *PVP exploits*, it's just you getting beaten. 
---
FO3= Single Player Game
---
FO76= Multiplayer Game
---
Should I explain more on why multiplayer games warrant a stricter balance than single-player games?
---
He got into the dev room and started dating Todd Howard's daughter.

Mopping up soda pop Ricky 
---
They're both effected by the Rifleman perks. Sneak works good with them too.
---
It’s crap like this that made me not care to glitch the budget in my favor.
---
I didn’t do dozens of turrets at whitesprings like some of the other overbudget isiots, but you better believe my camp is decked out the way I want it.
---
It didn’t fuck with the servers. At. All. So honestly idk why we can’t just [build bigger camp](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JeXSM11kCuU)
---
thats it's im still just trying to find those perfect 3* armors pieces and perfect weapons , (I don't trade) and just enjoy trying to perfect my loadout
---
ok thnx
---
So he got a bounty instead of being sent to elder scrolls v skyrim?
---
I think people are mad at the prices more than the fact that there is an atom shop.
---
And you can not recover your junk.  Happen to me twice in nuke zone walking backwards shooting! 
---
My first TSE was a tesla rifle, Gave it to a freind who only uses energy guns. later on I gave a lvl 45 Two-shot .44 (not a western) my melee guy found to a friend who uses pistols without really looking at it, turns out it was TSE too.
---
I loves me some Dog Food! Mandatory perk. Is worth it throughout all levels. The level 7 'Can Do' Luck perk will ensure you never run out.
---
Definitely. And lots of trash cans all over the place to search, particularly at Whitespring.
---
Batteries Included is 100% necessary, that 2mm ammo is crazy heavy 
---
Please?
---
I mean what in the blue hell could anyone possibly do to warrant that? 
---
Before last patch that didn’t happen. Even makes gas masks negative 3 now when you get rad worms
---
Junk in FO3 di  dn't have components. It's just junk... 
---
Base FONV and FO4 didn't have ammo weight either, it was added in their survival modes, and they wanted FO76 to have survival components.
---
This. This is why I got rid of my Gauss. 
---
yes it's abug since the last patch
---
to our hearts delight
---
Going on now my friend .
---
Army outfit + helmet and gas mask with goggles. When I use my 10mm SMG... I AM HUNK!
---
That's not possible. If you pick up multiple copies, it will only show as one in your inventory. You cannot drop copies to pick up.
---
However, you can easily farm them in military installations. The military wing in Whitesprings almost always has a copy available.
---
Damn that's really unfortunate then. 
---
Same here but i may be a bit impatient to get one of the skins for power armor, i still need 800 atoms ffs 
---
Its micro transactions over all. People hate them in general but imo they’re not as bad as most games. My only complaint is the lack of decent things to buy. I don’t want a dumb tracksuit or jogging outfit, I want Riot Armor or Maxson’s Battlecoat &gt;:(
---
Walk around at 22
---
Ultracite is the same total DR as the T-51. It just moves some DR to ballistic at the expense of energy.
---
So why is it crap?
---
I can pretyy much one shot anything with sneak multiplyer and my tse gauss
---
I came out of the vault to a Lvl 43 guy in power armor who waved, gave me a bag with an axe and a pistol, and walked with me to kill my first Liberators.  He quietly followed me until I got to my first CAMP, without joining any of my team invites, and would disappear at random.  Each time he re-approached me on my trek to the CAMP, he gifted me more stuff: caps, purified water, weapons, food, and looked out for me in case I couldn't kill the thing.  Because of him, I have now started to look out for players coming out of the vault, to gift them a weapon and water, and to take them places to find junk.  
---
I'm just now a Lvl 15 and finally was able to get him on a team and talk to him today!  Super nice guy.  He just helped me fix my current CAMP, supped up my weapons, and dropped plenty of plans.  He's a wealth of knowledge and I hope to continue to run into him.  
---
Hmm, I read that as long as you pick them up BEFORE you encounter the turn-in slot at Fort Defiance (?), you will pick up multiple copies.
---
It's only after you discover the quest that all your Technical Data combines into one.
---
You completely missed the point of the thread. No one cares about being killed or "beaten".
---
Awesome, I've got a list of 'eh' plans on my last post, so we could do a trade for either some of them or caps. I've got plenty of both
---
Good to know
---
So, should i drop everything that's in my Misc tab??? 
---
And don't pick up anything else?
---
Or are there things I'll need later?
---
Never played FO3
---
First off why is it that really high level players get bounties of 5 caps or even 10 to start with and i get 50 right off the bat? The bounty system is fucked and unfair
---
PS4? I can give you all of that for free. 
---
You also get plans for defending it when it is attacked. So if you are motivated by plans, it’s always free to travel back and defend. 
---
I was on a server by myself a couple hours ago. I planned to take over a couple power plants since I’m low on fusion cores but on my walk to it, forever over cumbered, the game froze on me 
---
nope hunters only works on yao guai, radstag, opposum, brahmin, megasloth, and a couple of others not scorchbeast unfortunately.
---
It's not as difficult as it might seem. Depending on your level and build could be more or less of a challenge actually getting through the silo, but the steps are fairly simple and straightforward. Here's a video.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H969EhPHK7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H969EhPHK7w)
---
I can't remember what that game puts in your misc tab, but most of it you'll almost never use.
---
 The crafting is very optional, and if you do find something you want to craft, collect the components later.
---
Make it a ‘debt’ debuff. 
---
Caps you earn after being killed for your bounty take stacks away from the debuff rather than being added to your total. 
---
In practice, the full bounty amount should go to the guy that claims it immediately. ‘Lore’ wise, as the offender you’d be paying off what you owe to this community we’re supposed to be rebuilding after being hunted for your sins. 
---
It’s about as valid as having a ‘wanted’ status in the wastes in the first place. If they actually worked on it, it could become pretty dynamic and interesting. We’ve been told we’re ‘rebuilding’. Law and economics are keystones. Use that. Have a police force branch of the responders with ‘Hunt x bounties’ quests. Have a raider hub at top of the world with ‘kill x responders’ or ‘reach x bounty’ quests. 
---
Just feels like they’ve missed a tonne of better ways to shoehorn PVP into 76. 
---
Because Chads who do the “HAHA let post the ‘Let me Google that for you’”meme are condescending as hell and it will get downvoted every time! This isn’t YouTube comments or twitter. We are capable of haveing a conversation here and this can be posted when ever anyone  asks a question... but often people like to be civil and actually answer, thus continuing the conversation like a decent human. 
---
 There is, go out light. 
---
 I'm sorry I farmed too much and kinda broke my sense of humor. ;)
---
I really wish it was more like Sea of Thieves
---
As /u/pheakelmatters said, Rifleman is a must. I'd throw on Tank Killer as well. 
---
It should. Technically they dealt damage to you, but your perk allowed you to avoid it. They still initiated a pvp, it just shouldn't damage you.
---
I might be wrong, I havent messed around with serendipity, and I havent yeeted anything on your question, but logically, it should count as then initiating combat.
---
Surprised to see an honest answer, glad to see you're holding firm with 76, I might get back into it again at a later date, but for now I'm taking a step away from it
---
There still out there keep seeing the same couple ppl pop up every few days with the same guns not accusing them but they def know were there coming from.
---
After playing so many Bethsoft games and messing around with the editors the question that comes to mind is: How? How the hell did they manage to mess this up? It's a disease effect that should only effect how much radiation damage you take. It should be as simple as making an effect that adds 50% to rad damage and making sure it doesn't interact with other effects to make it multiplicative. For how much they say they like using the Creation Engine because they're used to it and it's easy, Bethsoft Austin clearly isn't used to it.
---
What’s TSE mean?
---
No I'm pretty sure it doesn't. I had a bounty and people shot at me and it procced and I couldn't attack them.
---
OH MY GOD I'M SO MAD I'M ON XBOX
---
I don't see the problem either.  The game gives out plenty of Atoms too.
---
Do you know anything about the system though? Did they have a way to track individual items or did they not have that system in place
---
Stock up on screws. Lots and lots of screws. 
---
I saw one once and I remember screwing with the wires. I must have detonated it or something, I cant really remember. But I didnt see it again after that
---
I saved up for a week for the welcome home sign
---
If they did they wouldn't be having these problems. And I doubt any system has been placed as these guys are still getting away with it.
---
That's what I'm saying, I'm actually in this debate with some dude on YouTube who thinks they have always had a way to track these items.
---
-A game that was originally (before the backlash) priced as a full price AAA game selling items for the same price as a free title like fortnite is a problem to start with. 
---
-Follow that with the fact the atom shop launched as early as it did showcasing they deliberately cut content from a full price game to make extra money on the side. 
---
-Follow THAT up with the fact the atom shop contains multiple items that existed in fallout 4 AND most of them didnt even receive the slightest of changes or graphical upgrades. 
---
-The fact they intended to sell pay to win bonuses on the atomic shop and loot crates (lunch boxes) and are still testing the waters on that subject right now to see what they can get away with.
---
There is an absolute ton to be upset about in regards to the atomic shop, as for the whole "I'm level 15(0) and I still get lots of atoms" no it slows down to a trickle I have a level 167 and a level 78 outside of my weekly and daily challenges there are no more atoms to be earned.
---
You have to start the quest before the slot becomes active (I tried). Once the quest is started, you cannot stack the Technical Data. Beyond that, once you find the Technical Data, the quest auto repeats. I typically do this quest every time I play. It's so easy to find the Technical Data and camp venture is en route to Harper's Ferry, so it's a no brainer. I'm still trying to get those rare plans...grrr.
---
Has the Blackbird paint ever come back? Missed it the first time and have been waiting. Haven't played in a while though so I probably missed it again with the stupid limited time sales. 
---
Plan your build out before you start. That’s the biggest thing I can suggest. You don’t want to get almost maxed out like me and realize you should just start over. 
---
Yeah wouldn't waste your time ignorance is bliss.
---
Game froze on me earlier too.  Odd.

---
Oh God I wish that were true. I've done so many calculations for this game since its started
---
I wasted so many hours just scrubbing through fo4 for information it's ridiculous. 
---
your moving into areas with higher level mobs and if your gear isn't good enough your going to die faster and do less damage. 
---
It is according to Reddit.
---
The prices, seems to take forever to earn anything.... but I just gave up on that at this point lol
---
By the way, you only need 1 code card for whatever silo you are doing. You can get the codes online with a google search that are updated weekly if you want to skip the code cracking part.
---
thnx
---
Wish I knew man lol, I would also think it should be as simple as you described but I've never made a commercial game so I don't know what reason there could be for it not being that simple. 
---
My gear seems good for my level. It’s metal and raider armor that vary 14-20. I was reading it could be other players in the area but sometimes I’m the only one. 
---
I still love the game and I’m going to keep playing. I just can’t figure out why it’s gotten so hard all of a sudden. It’s ruthless lol
---
ive been trying to find one of those for ages now. im jealous
---
don't bother, you'll die, you'll be able to see your stuff but won't be able to get it. 
---
Frankly, I love all this shit. Screwing with other players was half the fun of invasion in the Souls serie. When you run out of conventional ways to entertain yourself it time to look for unconventional ways. The lesson learned is that it bloody time for new content to drop. Or the few players who stick around are going start doing weird shit.
---
Two shot explosive.
---
The regular things are pretty much all garbage. Toss them. The only thing you'll use that stuff for is ammo in the "Rock-it launcher".
---
Most of the rest is used in crafting. Though not cigarettes, baseball, or glove.
---
Don't give up. I thought the same thing the first run. Now I can knock it out in like 30 minutes while half asleep. Once you run around a few times and get the lay of the land its a cake walk. You can do it!
---
Why are you in this community if you dont like the game? Says alot about you than it does the person who made this post
---
It's a random event. It despawns if you leave it. 
---
There's too much garbage that I can't justify spending atoms on in there
---
Is there a guide to understanding what all the mods do? I don’t want to buy something u don’t need, but the names are super descriptive. What do Calibrated Shocks do? 
---
I dig it... creative.
---
Yes there is a huge problem with it, everything is overpriced and most of the items are stupid and the only cool items are limited. And getting atoms takes fucking forever at a high level
---
Get better internet.
---
Ran up to someone today to try to get myself killed. I had shot at Scorched near someone's tato farm and received wanted status. I asked her to kill me and she refused at first. She checked her PipBoy and I assume she was checking to see if anyone else was laying in waiting to ambush. I took off all my armor and asked her again. She obliged. LOL I thanked her and waved when I saw her again. I was level 27 and she was level 12 so I get the hesitation. I think the vast majority of folks are pretty nice.
---
I built my Camp at tippy-top of Seneca Rocks, level 12. Nice hiding spot until you level up enough for SB to visit.
---
Ahh the friendly hydraulic rocket mounted sentry bot walking the trade Brahmin. 
---
Yeah, completely random. You can find them in odd locations about Appalachia but it is a rare event.
---
Destroying camps
---
Lost two shotguns today. A TSE and TS. No clue how but after 500 hours I'm super careful because this happed when I got my Ultracite power armor from the BOS quest. I was wearing it and the helm literally depoped. I re enabled the SaveMyStuff mod now. Don't care if I have to reload the game to disable it when trading (it breaks trading but prevents this item loss bug at least). If I had lost my AAE I would prob just quit. Not taking anymore chances. Fix your game Bugthesda. Fix your crap UI, lag, crappy database, and everything else that contributes to this shit.
---
And steel. And lead. I once had around 1000 steel and thought to myself, "this should be enough." Boy was I wrong. And yes, never stop collecting screws.
---
I've had a guy have 8200 caps bounty. He must of been giving people's bases and workshops. Also probably wasn't alone just took photo when he was out of a team to make it seem like he was alone 
---
Most of the areas don't have much in the way of a level cap on mobs. Whoever comes close to the area first spawns the enemies. Basically what's going on is that the area you are going to has been spawned by a very high level character going close to the area and not clearing it. So since the area's creatures were spawned by the level 120 character that walked nearby and didn't kill anything, you get to have an area intended to be done at a much lower difficulty that's much harder than it should be. I don't think many people complain much because they tend to forget about how broken this is once they pass level 50
---
Fully perked and calibrated X-01 and maxed out batteries included, I carry about 2k rounds on me at any time bc they won’t fit jn my stash without the perks loaded lol 
---
Hope he got a Minj Nuke up his ass then, if that’s the case  lol 
---
Nice man. The first one I found was a double barrel 
---
Haha, that makes for a cute story though! And yeah, most people have been nice for sure. As I said in another comment, one of my favorite things has been getting guests in my camp and admiring other people's camps, and people are generally great. It just seems to be getting more common lately with people finding the cracks and digging at them, and with 3 bad events in one week I just had enough. 
---
Were you trying to decode it yourself?
---
Do that once if you really want to but then use the site that offers the codes weekly.
---
The rest can be quite painless depending on your build.
---
Not rare 
---
I mean it is pretty annoying. Whenever you see that your camp is being attacked and it’s by somebody over, say level 30, it’s usually best to just switch servers right away. 
---
Here have some of mi..... oh wait I'm  on PS4 ..
---
Check online, there are a number of sites that explain what the mods do. Calibrated Shocks give you, if I remember correctly, an extra carry weight of 50. If you have them on both legs, that's an extra 100.
---
 What are you using to kill stuff? Now I'm a balanced player myself and that's very rare. ;)
---
ty 
---
What a brave opinion, and this true gamer is being downvoted! 
---
Obsidian good, Bethesda bad. Praise Geraldo. 
---
If I remember correctly I found that like 30 minutes after leaving the vault. 
---
I have been watching too.  So far, nada :(
---
They should add some rockabilly or at least one Cramps song. 
---
This was an experience I also had with two friends on Xbox the other night. It was odd.
---
Maybe they should let go of some of those artists and hire more devs. And by shady prices I mean the controversy that happened around releasing a pack/skin with a x% slapped on it. Or the time they released a Christmas emote pack without informing people that it's not like the thanksgiving emotes (with different animations). Also there have been many (MANY) highly up-voted posts saying they want actual post-apocalyptic items instead of princess beds and silly things. Anyway.

I think things are too expensive for how slow the earning is but my biggest complaint is limited time things. I don't mind limited time sales though. but the sale prices are a little more in line with what they should be normally priced imo.
---
I don't actually mind spending money either and would buy much more if they were not as expensive.
---
I've been curious, does anybody know how all of the instruments sound when put together?
---
I don't think so, been checking nearly daily. Have the atoms burning a hole in my pocket for it.
---
Play in the Forrest, you don't need to follow the main quest right out of the vault,  you can go wherever you want in the Forrest area - beware other areas due to monster levels.
---
Most of all do what you find fun; exploring, crafting, killing or just building a camp.
---
Better yet, CROSS PLATFORM PRIVATE SERVERS.
---
Yeah, just blew your mind didnt I? Yeah that’s right

You can keep going back to the same location (serverhopping), theres probably a dozen different random events that can appear in that same location.

The bomb gives you some semi rare materials if you choose the correct wire, otherwise itll detonate. Apparently the blast is pretty underwhelming, most likely wont kill you.

I got lucky and disarmed the only one ive found.

I am having the same problem.  The last 2 points under "I am Become Death" are 1. Launch a nuke from any silo \[Decrypted launch code required\] 2. (Optional) Nuke fissure site prime (8+Players recommended).  The objective markers are on porta potties with "mysterious buttons", that when pressed do absolutely nothing.  So I collected 8 alpha site codes and went to Silo Alpha.  The biometric handscanner says "access denied".  I'm at a dead end here, any help would be appreciated.

I'm at the point 76 is losing interest for me so I am playing less but the only game that will drag me away at this stage is one piece world seeker.

many corpses will have those masses fluids even if you didnt kill them. i always check all the corpses at whitespring

Except the guy who was perma crouching.

I noticed this myself a while back. Managed to snag two calibrated shock mods within a few days of each other. The extra carry weight is awesome.
---
Hi you on line?
---
Homeless people still have life to loose. In 76, even death doesn't matter.
---
The fact that even if I were to spend real world money the pricing Is insane, some of the items are literally the price of the game in some areas. 
---
C'mon man you know those little succulants are cute af
---
I agree with debts remaining until they're paid. But being unable to do any quests or challenges while wanted doesn't seem right. What about those who get small, accidental bounties? I've done it, accidentally hitting someone's camp while just doing my business. And if you're not playing with friends, it's sometimes hard to find someone willing to end your misery quickly.
---
Clearly yes (honest answer)  Bethesda want and need you to purchase from the cash store long term, so they're doing it wrong.
---
If the pricing was more reasonable I wouldn't mind throwing parting with ten to fifteen dollars here and there, even every month if there was more to do in the game.  Twenty dollars plus for one item, yeah nah sorry.  Atoms earned in game dry up very quickly for a long term higher level player.  I wouldn't purchase anything that I didn't think was 'reasonable' value for money solely on principle alone.
---
They strike fear in the hearts of many 😂
---
I’ve been on alone in a server a few times. Mostly late at night/early morning. I prefer it over a full server 
---
This post feels like a troll. I feel like the instructions for connecting power couldn't be clearer;
---
Placed item states required electricity in red until connected
---
Generators state how much power they supply
---
There is quite clearly an attach wire option that only shows up on generators and items requiring power. 
---
Seems pretty obvious? 
---
Sounds like they should've just made FO5 afterall and y'all would've had even more fun 
---
&gt; How? How the hell did they manage to mess this up?
---
Hahaha, I thought the same thing. I think their patch notes said "rad worms correctly adds radiation damage"
---
RadwormsAaand... radworms and??? *Everything else*

Side quest the video game 
---
Reading back on it does seem really dumb, I probably should point out that I hadn’t played in a couple weeks and decided instantly that I would capture a workshop. Whoops
---
Thanks for this info... I will look for it! 
---
Take a look at what different junk scraps into. It makes it a lot easier to get whatever scrap you need if you know what makes it.
---
Scrapping lots of weapons you pick up from enemies will allow you to learn mods for it and even the plans to build the gun itself. 
---
Armor works the same, but a lot slower vs the amount scrapped. 
---
Not all mods can be learned that way some will have to be bought from vendors. 
---
My only problem is the turret dmg. It is just a joke, a tier 2 machine gun turret takes like 1/5 of you budget and deals less dmg than a mole rat.
---
I felt they should give us a free respec coin/token at lvl 50, and an additional one every 25 levels afterwards.  
---
To me this seems like a decent compromise.  Players could spend 25 levels focusing on perk cards and then get the respec  token and move all the points at one time.
---
I believe someone put out the idea of making a respec part of a repeatable quest.  These two ideas could be combined.
---
I remember that one, south of by the hemlock golf course xD Yeah would be nice to see. At least my base I can hear my missile turrets, but sometimes they leveled it by the time I get there and have a 1500 bounty. I removed all buyers from my friends list because of this. Haven't had a problem lately. Probably someone from the market!
---
I liked Bethesdas idea, when in pacifist it'll make your base invulnerable to player attack.
---
did they return the power of the TSE's?  after my TSE went to less damage than some normal loot guns on a patch... It was the last straw for me and I haven't played since... 
---
Someplayers deserve bans. That kinda hate has no place anywhere mostly over a damn game
---
Honestly my biggest complaint about it is the description for the map isn't: "It glows... in the Fucking dark!"
---
If the community has so many voices that don't PVP, maybe there's a reason for that. Like the fact that the PVP mechanics are pretty trash right now.
---
So you are saying they prioritized the advanced development of the atom store before they prioritized the game.  So you proved your own point incorrect.
---
Chances are the player is running full sentinel/assassin armor so he's taking little to no damage and one hitting people with a power fist or TSE weapon while standing still
---
Ive seen other comments before where someone lobbed rounds off at something in the woods and got flagged.  I can’t even remember what I shot at, but I earned wanted status ant didn’t even steal anything. I finished the night out and the next day come to find I’m still wanted. I ran an event with some dude who didn’t care, but then got jacked by someone else while depositing to a stash box. 
---
So how the hell do I loose wanted status?
---
Pick up every battered clipboard and desk fan you can. Screws and springs are basically gold and silver out in the wasteland.
---
I mainly use a pump action shotgun, I recently found a silenced one that does more damage. Around 86 it says. I have a .44 which does 60 damage. The sword from the sisterhood  mysteries quest line . And a combat rifle that uses all the garbage .38 ammo I find. And the last thing is a hardened marksman sniper (which I’ll say is always reliable when I’m hidden. It’s the one gun I have that does consistent heavy damage.)
---
Those songs are hilarious! I turn it on from time to time.
---
That’s what I think I’m going to start doing. I’ll level up in the meantime and find some better loot eventually. 
---
u/Polonium-239 is probably an unstable element.
---
I think they do it on purpose to give players a reason to explore. If that makes since. If we aren’t strong enough to progress the quests then we’re left with exploring to find better things and get stronger. 
---
Ugh, second that.
---
Take a 0 off the end of every hand out and price tag. Now you can grind out for free at the same rate and the price for fucking pallet swaps doesn't border on abusive everyone is mostly happy.
---
Geez I hate these fucking appologists with no sense of consumer rights or fair pricing...
---
Yeah it's weird.  
---
There’s a mod for that on the Nexus.
---
[Fallout 76 Nexus - More Where That Came From - Radio Mod With DJ Included](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/126) 
---
They will fix that accidental damage to CAMP / workshop items in the upcoming patch. They said that you will need to actually destroy the stuffs in CAMP / workshop to get wanted status (this means you have to continuously attack the CAMP / workshop).
---
For you u/Mooncow027, free balls and a good time included. 
---
Also wish I had neon signs..can’t find those plans.
---
They've even included items that take them no effort at all to add in! Stuff like the pilot helmets and clean suits from FO4 are in the Atom Shop files. Stuff they don't need to do anything to make at this point. 
---
Wait if you crouch, does that hide your little blip?
---
They made them run away if you jump up on something as well... all of a sudden they travel going 100mph away....
---
The question is will people lose their account if they use that? 
---
depends on the damage at moment of death. If its overkill, no chance to be revived, however if the damage is enough to kill the player, then it will drop them to their knees.
---
Same as dying to ghoul, you drop on ur knees, however a death claw instantly kills u.
---
Shit happens sorry for your loss 
---
It's all great, but it only shows how extremely fast PC playerbase is dying.
---
i’m getting the exact same problem but i’m on xbox and not sure what i should do
---
Red wire right? Haha
---
Pacifist mode doesn't mean you can not get hurt if your wanted it doesn't matter when where or who they can hurt you.
---
I mean, they do have a missile silo holotape, why not a vendor holotape?
---
With tonight's 'fun,' i think I'm calling it. I had high hopes for the game, gave it a fair shake, couple toons over 50. Ive done all the quests (dailys at least once), something i have NEVER done in fallout before, I've killed other dwellers and have been killed, been griefed, survived til my bounty has cleared. Ive dropped the nuke, ive done it solo. 
---
Tonight, i just got fed up. Stealth toon with chameleon, just trying to not be seen while this scorchbeast flies overhead. My controller slips and as i catch it i bump the weapon switch. Oh, right: this weapon isn't camouflaged. Instant detection and death, doesn't matter that i was completely [hidden] prior. It takes me 4 more just to get my junk back and away, the junk being the only thing keeping me online at this point, since I was mid vendor-run with all my bulk to sell.
---
I was planning on moving on next week for Anthem, coming back to check patches and expansions (if it survives that long),  but I'd rather not play than play this anymore. Much disappoint, Bethesda. I'm sorry, i really love this series, so do better
---
There is no way I’ll spend any substantial effort on making a camp until it’s safe from PvP. Repair/rebuild is just no fun for me.
---
Error code 4:8:2000 on ps4 what is going on?? Ive contacted support on every way and get no response me and my friends cannot log on while others can with no issues
---
I know I’ll get downvoted for this on this sub but whatever I’ve been downvoted a ton today. The issue with the atomic shop is how the prices compare to real life $. The fact is a power armour skin for the equivalent of 18$ in atomic shop points is just ridiculous. Yes you can grind out for the points through the challenge system but it doesn’t change how overpriced buying the points  is, and that’s the real issue people have with it. At least that’s what i think.
---
It's because people want to hate the game. Yet the same people will praise Red dead online or GTA online when they do the same damn shit and worse. 
---
Haha, I think I did the first option (which might have actually been red). I read its always random, so I just said fuckit, no point in choosing
---
Nice haha i just went the old fashioned movie reference but i thought for sure i was going to be annhilated lol
---
Tbh this might be an unpopular opinion, but I have no problem paying for the atoms when I want to get cosmetics. It’s purely optional, has no real benefit. It’s like fancy clothing IRL, you don’t need it, but you buy it because you want others approvals. Yeah maybe I’m narcissistic.
---
Yeah the fact that you get them for daily and weekly  is great, you can still get them regularly and without a ridiculous grind. Just regular playing
---
I wasnt a huge fan of the shop in Skyrim or FO4, but I think they handled it very well in 76
---
I think a player hub would be better if it were its own place where there are more players allowed to log into the server allowing us to set up booths or browse like 50 booths and have 100 buyers it’ll give better options and less server hopping give options to test weapons or armour before purchasing in a controlled environment with an enemy of your choice
---
I'd rather fair or favourable prices with no handouts to handouts as a cheap excuse to get away with mobile game whaling. This isn't fucking fortnite.
---
Also if bethesda always gives away so much for free as you falsely claim (seriously this is a flat out lie) then they wouldn't make any money to keep the game operational.
---
I mean that sucks, but...if you’re using a workbench at your camp, it’ll just take the resources from your stash, so you don’t have to actually have it on you. The only time I ever have any junk on me is when I’m doing runs.  
---
I dont have an issue with buyin atoms either just think its a lil more expensive than what it needs to be.
---
And don’t forget cutting open small nuclear warheads to put trees in. 
---
Not all junk can be bulked.  The ones with a zero cap cost can be. The rest can be sold as-is. However. when buying them from a vendor, they come bulked. 
---
They have separate teams for these things... The shit in the shop is most likely handled 100% by the art team. Those aren't the guys who are going to be fixing bugs for you and if they are then lord have mercy on this game. It's almost like separate teams of humans can exist and work on different things at the same time. 
---
I love the atomic shop idea but they need to cut the prices by 50%. So instead of a power armor paint costing 1800 atoms it would cost 900. That way we can actually get them without saving up for 2+ weeks
---
I haven’t so far. The only thing I’ve seen online that people are getting banned for is having cheatengine.exe running while having fallout 76 running. I’ve been using a multitude of mods from the nexus and in the two months I’ve been playing I haven’t come across any warning or anything saying I’m gonna get banned. 
---
 You can make good use of a more tactical hunting rifle at those levels. Put Reflex sights on a hard hitting one and it can take care of a lot of situations you get into. 
---
 Get a Lever Action if you can. Hits as hard as a Hunting Rifle but cycles much faster. 
---
You're broke because you chose to seek revenge instead of just ignoring him :) 
---
Except the server will still crash after you take over the junk pile and set up the extractors.
---
And then you spend 15 minutes trying to get on a team with your friend before you get frustrated and just quit
---
I was at a workshop I took over using a workbench when I got killed. No warning whatsoever.
---
Make stash shared between characters so transferring weapons to other characters is easier. Or add a way to share/transfer items between characters 
---
Workshop means you are flagged for PVP
---
I don't understand a few of the atomic shop outfits. Why would you buy the greeser jacket they are all over the place.
---
after a whitespring run, players sell the 1* legendaries to the vendors or just drop them. It's normal to see them. You could even find players that drop god tier items in the vendor. A week ago, I found a bloodied fire axe with swing speed 2* sitting at watoga. Bought it for 300 caps and sold it to a melee user for 3k lol
---
 If players are out to destroy your c.a.m.p. a locked door ain't gonna help 
---
New Vegas wasn't Bethesda.
---
True true
---
I got a 3 star instigating TSE black powder pistol with a min level of 10. Its awesome for leveling. I used it till i got to 50 and could use a tse laser pistol i found before the patch that removed explosive from laser pistols. Im saving the black powder pistol in my stash in the hopes someday they will implement a weapon display for camps.  Id show off that sucker
---
Fyi, he did the poseiden event for a plan. He server hopped to do it again.
---
But gz on the fusion cores.
---
That's actually good to know, personally I'm on PS4 so mods (atleast right now), are useless to me. Tho I'm gonna pass this info along to some friends. 
---
Im having the same issue. I can't get crits as I once did
---
I bought the mod just to realize that you need violet flux (which is somewhat hard to find by Whitesprings). No violet last 4-5 nukes I’ve been in. Guess I gotta nuke the Toxic Valley for some of those mutated ferns. 
---
rumor. 
---
Yes... Unless you're wanted... 
---
My only complaints with the atomic shop are:
---
* I dont find most of the content that exciting
---
* There isnt (as far as I know) a preview where I can see the items either on my character or in 3d, so I can really tell if I want it.
---
My first was a gatling gun. I love that big ol lunk. Got me through the watoga rooftop ambush which turned into an inconvenient scorchbeast attack.
---
You did not
---
The quest also gives a stat bonus of some kind, and I believe it's a little better or if you protect all of them.  I forget the exact bonus though, so I'm kind of useless, sorry
---
It's an already quest. Daily, the power plant a bit north of Summersville, Maria and her lover hung there and analyzed environmental variables from a PC in a trailer there. There's a holotape with details beside the PC on the floor.
---
When it pops, it chooses a water, a soil, and an air analyzer from the pool of those Forest analyzers. You go collect the data, come back to Maria's PC, and upload the data, then analyze :)
---
Pacifist doesn't protect you if you get wanted. And you shouldn't bee carrying that much junk on you if you are wanted.
---
It isnt the games fault it's yours lol
---
Thank you
---
I know what you mean ! Sometimes I go to Westek and as soon as i move crouched they detect me even with all perks, camo gear and checked stats. So frustrating !!! I suspected that there was some unknown, non displayed disease and tried taking a disease cure and BAM ! I didn't have a problem. Even when i have radworms and other diseases I either take a cure or go sulphur fountain to cure and often don't have an issue. Problem is disease cure is so hard to find.
---
They said in recent fix notes that there was a bug with radworms causing 50% to effects ????  I wonder if this somehow affects stealth / sneaking. Next time it happens try popping a disease cure and see if it helps.
---
Holy shit, well, I learned something!
---
I have no issue with cosmetic microtransactions, I just think what's in the store is overpriced and absolute rubbish.
---
The fact that I don't want any of it aside, the price they are asking when you consider its generally no more than a very basic reskin or item that was already in FO4 is just insane. 
---
I've happily payed those prices on multiple occasions in path of exile because you get a well designed, unique custom modelled, textured item, often with its own animations and graphical effects. Those are worth the money, a set of shit pajamas that don't fit the setting do not. 
---
Whatever troll. Go back to ur fucking cave. I don’t need ur shit.
---
Happened to me today too. Just left the world, came back and tried again and it worked. Sucks, but that’s FO76 for ya. 
---
That's what I've been doing for the past hour
---
Yo where did you get that wicked bottle?
---
My friend with birds bones, marsupial, speed demon and strange in numbers was able to sprint from the top of his jump all the way down just boosting it hundreds of metres. I'll see if he saved footage
---
&gt; I don't understand what the hate is towards the shop. Is there really a problem with it? 
---
My Top 3 complaints:
---
1. "Limited time" items are predatory as fuck and only exist to get people to spend more money on impulse buys based on an item's perceived rarity instead of quality.
---
2. Quality of items doesn't match the suggested price. 
---
3. I want a fucking coffin bed.
---
I’ve only had one pvp fight that wasn’t me just getting hit once and dying (used to happen all the time before I went pacifist). I defended a workshop against 2 people that were higher levels than me and I was almost invincible. Not sure what happened, but their shots weren’t doing anything and my attacks were taking 1/4 to  1/3 of their health.
---
I didn’t have good weapons or armor, a focused build, or anything that makes me “good”. I felt like I was cheating because I should have died easily instead of repeatedly killing them both. 
---
I’m not bragging (I’m not a pvper), it just seems like something is broken to me too
---
Can we run a comparison with Vault 8? If vital systems were disabled such as power, ventilation and water and Vault-Tec didn't rig the entire Vault to blow up, how hard can it be to restore it?
---
I haven't bought anything from the atomic shop yet, I'm still fairly new to the game. I am considering buying the Silver Shroud outfit though, but I have enough atoms to buy it without spending real money.
---
I bought the pelican 32 ounce [here](https://www.thepelicanstore.com/accessories/cooler/pelican-bottles) and added some matte blue spray paint with a vault-tech yellow sticker from amazon.  I'm also doing something similar to a [Vault V600 large case](https://imgur.com/a/6Zw0OA7) outside right now in blue/yellow.  
---
What's up with the accuracy on VATS? Even at close range it's so hard to hit them.
---
I know this is super late but i thought it was a bug when i saw it tbh
---
I feel a bit of that when I loot the first aid kits or the typewriter around the vendor.  I also try to avoid taking stuff at the overseer’s camp. 
---
I could go for some chocolate milk, though. Making my own with Hershey’s syrup was always a treat. 
---
Same here, dont know what happened
---
damn thats like some gtav shit.
---
I agree regardless. But something tells me about Bethesda probably wanting to further the RNG by making you play more to compete for others on item drops. Enemy spawns. Which leads to diversified gameplay and overall "forcibly" broadening your game play experience. 
---
I'm just speculating. So I could be completely wrong. 
---
Have you ever put Hot Chocolate Mix with Marshmallows on top of vanilla ice cream? 
---
I believe that is a known issue, but someone else who actually uses one can chime in. 
---
I was known for attacking low levels a lot back then, but the kind person who gifted me a western outfit has made me a LOT nicer, been giving back to low levels rather than attacking them.
---
I’ll have to try that some time. For now, I might just make myself and Irish Coffee. 
---
I'm on ps4 too dang
---
Workshops open you up to pvp....
---
Ahaha shame he didnt save it, sounds like fun I might have to try it myself. 
---
I heard West Tek is good, also uranium fever the event, and Watoga Highschool Monster Mash.
---
I also saw that thread. I have to assume, and I don't think it's tinfoil to say so, that he is either an attention seeking troll who knew full well what he was posting; a Beth competitor who is paid to create accounts and badmouth competitors; or god forbid a foreign actor. 
---
I still can't believe anyone legit felt like that poster!
---
Western duster, sunglasses, and a cowboy hat
---
I’m around if u still want Shielded raider 
---
Why wouldn't you stash the second you got a bounty?
---
And how did you get a bounty with pacifist mode on?
---
Hopefully you weren't packing all that junk and lockpicking ppls supply drops, that's just asking for it.
---
And hopefully you didn't have a workshop under attack message pop up and just ignore it.
---
Congratulations! My self control is below zero so I've spend around $60 in the shop myself 
---
Death by player.
---
Fuuuu. Thanks. I regret my purchase
---
I prefer a chug and chase
---
Another cool thing would be to have "sets" like when you have a bunch of different interviews. 
---
FO76 doesn’t have a casual play mode like the previous games. The casual play modes of those games game ammo a weight of 0, didn’t require you to sleep, eat, or drink, and didn’t run the chance of diseases. These features were included in the hardcore/survival modes of FO:NV and FO4 and were made mandatory for all players of FO76. 
---
Congrats!  Ive never found anything with the exploding mod, but I do have a Two shot prime ultracite minigun that has 90% weight reduction and 10% damage bonus.  I’ve been slowly crafting a ton of ammo.  Should be fun in a fissure prime nuke!! 
---
Possible. You would need an environmental suit as the deeper parts of the vault would likely be void of oxygen. Space suit maybe?
---
I made a thread months ago about just waiting long enough for everyone else to leave and you have yourself a private server. Glad to see it's still a thing even if if I was downvoted a bunch.
---
And unretrievable loot bag. 
---
My favorite is the limited release camo skin I snagged that I put on my bloodied explosive hunting rifle.. Pair it with the combat armor camo skin, or the Forest Camo jumpsuit (don’t forget to wear the beer hat) and you’ve got a true wasteland redneck experience!
---
Me either.....But I don't play.....dose that count?
---
F3, F4 and FNV are the entirety of why I got a current gaming system. I boight an xbox 1 due to post divorce guilt. 
---
Me either because this game is a hot pile of garbage. 
---
I perma crouch..... but didn't know this
---
ty sir
---
Thanks friend. I appreciate it.
---
If you buy the mod you don’t need mats.   It shows them in the menu but they are part of the mod.   Now if you bought the plans, you need the materials to make them. 
---
That being said, awesomest shit ever. I'm old as fuck. Stopped at the N64. Because, I'm old as fuck.
---
Honestly I feel like the hate is just idiotic people jumping the let’s hate bethesda bandwagon because most games have micro transactions nowadays but FO76 did it well you can earn points nothing is P2W there’s no RNG it’s a good system. 
---
I had the same thing after midnight Wednesday. played for hours without interruption.
---
On paper it sounds like an interesting idea. It probably was approved because it was a new and the narrative was different vs. previous fallouts. The problem with this is it goes on for too long and then you realize it's kind of boring being the only person around. (I think this would have been okay for like act 1 or even 2.) Sure you can interact with real people, but most don't. Even when we do, it's not like we act like a character in the story line. We act like people playing the game so it's really not adding anything to story. It kind of interrupts the immersive experience.  
---
When taking a workshop you have a huge disclaimer warning you that you're triggering pvp.
---
You asked for it, craft at your camp next time
---
Go to mama dolces and find the keycard.
---
Somewhere hidden Is a secret Chinese base that is the R+D department
---
It talked about upgrading them to make them more intimidating to the capitalist scum
---
Is that what we’re doing now? Banning people for having a big ego?
---
Three points of Intelligence will net you a perk called "Batteries Included" that works like the equivalent Strength perk "Bandolier" for ballistic ammo, but for energy ammo, dropping the weight of 2mm EC by 90%.   It's vital for a gauss build.  It also reduces fusion cores from 3lbs to .3 each, which is LOVELY.
---
Where is West Tek?
---
What about the ticks at the moonshiners shack or lumber yard?  Most of us are guilty of farming tick blood and taking those precious first XP points from the newly emerged.  
---
Probably stacked serendipity, dodgy, assassin's gear, empath team mates/lone wanderer. If you have cola nut and a stack of nuka quantums you're pretty invincible.
---
Never spent a single dollar in the atom shop or on the game (birthday present from roommate he pre-ordered for me in July) loved my 300 hours of play time for the most part but taking a break
---
I've observed this as well, but I'm thinking it's more related to how soon you fire after hitting VATS.  If I charge, then hit VATS, and just hold my fire for a second or two, it'll hit.  Otherwise it whiffs by a large margin.  Same if I hit VATS, charge, and fire too quickly.  An extra second usually makes the shot count.
---
Most ppl get their mutations by getting rads, well they try till they get sick of only getting shit they don't want, give up and buy them. I've seen plenty of ppl selling the mutation serums for 500 caps each.
---
Same reason raiders are a thing. I'm rather enjoying the multiplayer part of this multiplayer game. Without that, there isn't much to do other than farm the SBQ for the most extensive explosive vent collection
---
Oh thank god its not just me. I've been losing my mind trying to figure this out.
---
I can't login on my main account after getting an internet disconnection roughly 2 hours ago, but my mule account can still login fine.
---
oh nooooo, still just imagine you probably made some other people very happy.
---
look from the golf course on the map, go right and you'll see a big red building, then a grey building to it's right, that is west tek.
---
Certain ones yes, and yes players would buy them if they weren't expensive. Search the bazaar section and go from there...  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/new/)
---
the grey building is west tek
---
How about tweaking the cap floor so it can go negative for pvp purposes? It makes sense and just like in real life, one don’t escape consequences by simply saying they have no money. 
---
If someone make 10,000cap worth damage to the society(other players’ property/well being), he has to pay it back before he can buy/walk freely again.
---
He can still play the game but won’t be able to fast travel, purchase item from vendor and occupy workshops. And without the fast travel, his ability to do more harm to the society would be severely limited given the huge map and only a handful of players on each server.
---
This can act as a deterrent for grieving without completely disabled pvp in pve servers.
---
Bro, I joined at like level 13
---
Picked it up at Fallout 4. And thought it was the best shit ever. Went back to Fallout 3. Which put me on the path to FNV. Greatest game ever. My God!!!!!!! I did really like F4. But the path is paved. You're gonna do what the makers want you to do.....no ,matter your decisions. FNV is the penultimate!!! I'm sorry they couldn't better it.....But how could they?......
---
Don’t be hating on the fish lamp!!  It’s like having a pet waiting for you when you return home.   
---
It just occurred to me how localized the servers are. Not only do we have the three different platforms which don’t intermingle, but I suspect each server is built around the native language of the players so that microphone and text chatting could happen across people who speak the same language. 
---
It is very unlikely I will ever play with someone in a different part of the world unless English is their main language in the preferences.
---
I had the same issue yesterday coming in through the back door.  I just walked away,, checked that the veil was on and walked back to the grid and it worked.  This was on Xbox. 
---
/r/madlads 
---
This is what happens when a game starts to die...
---
Same happened to me for12 hours strait yesterday. Had 2 friends joining me and we slaughtered 3 Queens and and a fourth on whispering befor passing out. Best day ever tons of good loot and even more fun😆
---
The hardest part is knowing the exact path through the silo, until you have the place memorized you spend a lot time running around.  
---
&gt;How? 
---
Bethesda has always had decent ideas and have been able to make nice enough frameworks for others to build upon, but when it comes to actual quality of their work and such they're *really* bad at it. Obviously bugs will happen or mistakes will be made, but they make so many that you have to really wonder just what is going on behind the scenes.
---
Look at a game like Skyrim. Sure, it's fun and it plays well enough. But it has literally *thousands* of bugs, hundreds of which are from basic typos and such. A typo is an amateur mistake, but they're also to be expected. *Hundreds* of them though? Fucking how?
---
FO76 is no different. Things like bobby pin weight or fusion core production rates are literally the matter of shifting a decimal point a couple places. Literal 10 second fixes, and yet they've been fixed/broken multiple times now. The people working there don't *really* know what they're doing, and it shows.
---
I played during the superbowl and got to experience what Fallout 76 would be like if the servers were stable. 9/10 would recommend. 
---
I don't think the "recent" tab in social, works the way you mentioned. I believe it just lists the players that have been on that server/session. I have looked at the "recent" player list and a lot of the names (over 30) on the list don't show up as dots on the map. 
---
You die and won’t be able to reach your dropped loot even though the bag is there daring you to try it.  Don’t!  It didn’t end well for me (several times, but I’m stubborn like that).
---
Literally laughing. I had the same issue.
---
I find the rad resist on my T-51b to be adequate while farming Nuke blast zones.  Also, I have a junk pile and farm springs so springs aren't really a problem for me.
---
Honestly I ♡ the T-51b for its iconic look and I personally always felt it was overall the best looking Armor.   I have all of them and love my X01, but the T-51b has a special place in my heart and that's why I chose to build it exclusively.  
---
only thing I've purchased with Atoms earned in the game is a pip-boy skin. Still waiting for a power armor skin that I actually like. The only one I ever wanted was the charcoal with red decal carbon skin for my X-01, but missed out on the limited time only sell. If that was still up I would snap it up in an instant, even if I had to spend a couple of bucks to do so!
---
I’ll add, there’s a distinction between skins in a game like 76 and skins in a game like Fortnite. People are going to see you a lot in a game like Fortnite, paying for nice skins is a way to show off. But in a game like 76, interactions with strangers are rare, and many people seem to actively avoid them.
---
Hmm I guess you are right... I'll update the post
---
Yeah Friday there was 4 people on my server. 
---
Today I started with 8 and ended up with 4. 
---
Crazy. 
---
springs are super easy to get. Go to camp mcclintock or sugar grove, easy 25-30 a run. Theres other places as well, but those are where i go for mine. Camp mclintock i can pop down for a few caps from sutton (I sell to raider vendors here) and get all those in 2-3 minutes tops. I typically hit this every day on my selling tour and have a few hundred as a result. 
---
i have same code.  havent been able to log on for a couple hours now.  Played fine earlier in the day.
---
True. I just think they also need to add other perks that can counter certain perks, like a perk card that if you had it on it was a radius around you that suppresses mutations, the counter would obviously be to not fight them melee. It would make players have a more dynamic build and force choices. Well, not just that one of course. Its just an example
---
Cannot think of anything weird that I have done differently. It’s super weird.
---
Or, how about if your bounty is higher than your caps, you drop more things than junk upon death? And I'm not talking chems like in the new PVP mode. The fear of losing their beloved legendaries would help curb this behavior. I would definitely be more willing to go after a high-bounty player if I knew there was a chance I could snag some weapons or armor if they didn't have the caps to pay.
---
If your account is not authorised then it means you have either been banned or do not own the game anymore 
---
yeah when i first started out i would typically take 2-3 in an area and just keep defending them for plans. haven't spent much in the way of caps for building plans and I have most of them, and not many I want that i don't have. Really not worth it to buy them when they aren't terribly hard to get if you play enough. 
---
Banning people for death threats?
---
I mean, I don't do a lot of online gaming, but that sounds like some pretty good playerbase engineering
---
Banned 
---
I once had a situation or so I thought like that but it turned out everyone was just crouching around I guess. We thought it was just us and we nuked a big area it was our first nuke or at least mine. After we did that we felt a bit bad because will killed a bunch of players who were in the nuke landing area but they just respawned and joined us going around killing and tagging everything int he nuke area. We ended up with a huge group working together having fun. Even if someone shot you by mistake no one did any retaliation or anything because everyone knew they did not mean it. That was the only time though. Any other time we nuked there was always at least one higher rank guy trying to spoil the fun but Since me and my friends were pretty high levels if that started happening we would go after the dude trolling and he eventually would back off or leave. 
---
It's not just this game, the holotape problem has been ignored by Bethesda for the last few games.  
---
BOOM! Headshot.
---
Not now. I've seen the fusion generator at a vendor. originally it was only acquired by powering up nuke stations quests.
---
I've been doing PvP lately and the amount of scorn you get from playing the game with an intentional game mechanic is stupifying. You counstantly get discounted as a duper/exploiter. It almost encourages you to go full on raider since that's what you're assumed to be. 
---
As for one shot hits: you only have 350ish hit points max, and most well specced builds do 400+. I'm not a mathematician, but it's pretty obvious how this pans out. My PvE character is 320ish. My PvP character is 90ish so I lose less caps. The PvP guy can't solo a scorchbeast, but he's only fighting smoothskins, so he only needs 400-500 damage + armor pen. That's a pretty easy feat.
---
No it is someone CHOOSING to persue one aspect of the mechanic which makes no sense. How does leveling a base that's miles away from a workshop help take over the workshop?
---
I understand destroying a base near or at a workshop especially if it is armed and can help protect the workshop.
---
Most of the time it is people going "yay bounty less PvP cos he took a workshop" not "wow I really need the resource that workshop is producing and am willing to fight for it"
---
Stop pretending people are using the mechanic correctly. 
---
Easy to obtain especially for lower levels thats about the only appeal.
---
try different workshops.
---
Sounds like ya maybe did something that you weren’t supposed to do
---
I've begged Bethesda to be able to zoom in on notes. I have poor eyesight and basically have just given up on reading notes. 
---
will do
---
i hate u too
---
When your health is zero in PvP, do you get a brief time window to stim yourself?  In PvE you apparently don't.
---
So are there 3 stages in dying?  (1) Zero health, but a brief time to stim yourself.  (2) Zero health and kneeling, you can't stim yourself, but others can stim you.  (3) Zero health and lying on the ground, must respawn (or call for help).
---
I use it on my sniper so I can still sneak.
---
Same. I even checked my email and refreshed it about 10 times to see if I had, for whatever reason, been banned. Submitted a support ticket, and the reply was to tell me that I was trying to play the beta and I needed to purchase the game and activate it. 
---
I’ve gotten wanted by accident before. Spent around two minutes waiting at Whitespring for somebody to come and do the deed for me. 
---
This is a great analogy. I feel like this every time I pass through. It's just such a great area to top off food, chems, and basic crafting supplies. I usually make up for it by trying to help out any low levels I find in the area by either dropping them stuff or helping them complete Fertile Ground.
---
I've always wondered why the bounty is paid from the bad guys stash. That isn't how bounties work that's how looting works. 
---
I believe you can also get more rad resist using hazmat with rad meds and certain skills or something like that. Been a while since I played but a guy was telling me about it
---
Both times I launched Nukes by myself this happened. Have done many dozens of Scorched Earth Events without crashing when it is not mine. It is like a curse.
---
That doesn't sound too good for a online game. 
---
The vendor in the Enclave (Command area) sometimes sells a GR w/ suppressor...  I think it was roughly 1000 caps.
---
I'm seeing a LOT of people with this error code between here, facebook, and twitter. My support ticket said to purchase the game, but I can definitely show them my receipt. 
---
The floor tiles are a must for me.
---
I read that as rape apparel list. I'm either a bad person or very tired.
---
That's exactly where I'm at. I got to level 300 and I really don't have any interest in banking another 250 explosive vent plans. Until new weapons get introduced, there's no reason to farm whitesprings other than to help friends out. So instead I'm going to fight an AI system that isn't full on potato. Something that knows what real cover is. Something unpredictable. Something that poses a real threat to me. It's other players. 
---
Also, this is a great alternative to farming springs/screws/aluminum. Players are my favorite resource and farming gets old
---
Funny, you sure seem to.
---
Yes! I see so much good stuff for sale from console players and my heart sinks when I see the tag isn't PC. I'm willing to bet the bulk of the user base is console.
---
I also haven't spent real money, but I don't really like the shop. It's too cheeky. Paint jobs for one weapon. Paint jobs for one armour (the power armour sets are fine). If they sold one paint job for several weapons, then it'd be ok. The clothes are kind of dull. Where are those cool T-shirts from the Fallout 4 shop? I liked them. They were free. You get like 30 of them. In the Fallout 76 shop you pay 800 Atom Caps for one outfit.
---
I'd like it if it sold more interesting reskins of things, or if it sold the clean versions of in-game items, or if it sold stuff in sets instead of as individual items.
---
I've gotten 8 levels in 2 hours before at whitesprings nuke zone, maybe they spent a ton of time there? Granted i'm 117 with over 300 hours in so I'm not the most efficient leveler but I've had a few sessions where the xp was insane, leveling every 10-15 minutes because people kept respawning the ghouls so fast i barely had time to loot. 
---
Please all us to zoom the view of notes. 
---
I have seen multiple comments about this. I have impaired vision in one eye from a childhood injury and slightly doubled vision in the other. If I get right up in front of the screen, I can read the notes, but who wants to do that?
---
It ought to be an easy solution to help gamers with impaired vision to allow us to click to magnify the size of the notes. 
---
It would get janky if you took off the cards with items overweight in stash.
---
Also of you use fist weapons, you can't wear power armor. 
---
There are also cases where if you do WAY to much stealth damage, like over 5000, you'll hit for 1 damage because reasons. My Quad Assaultron Head when used in stealth (after dealing with the ammo bug and dropping your ammo to reload properly) i cant even kill a lvl 1 scortched. Granted it says it deals 2000 energy damage when charged, then add stealth 2x and so on. Could be the same issue. Gauss Rifles have been buggy in the past. 
---
I do this all the time to farm lead. There is a party to be blamed here but it is not you, me or any other player lol
---
Before I quit I had a super creepy experience where I was on a server alone but a guy with no name tag or any marker on the map followed me around for a bit before T-posing and disappearing 
---
Grifters, grifters never change.
---
I currently have a server with only one other person in it, if anyone wants to join. 
---
I met a guy a while back who was clearly on another continent and didn't speak a lick of english. 
---
Ibalso met a guy from Jersey. That was pretty wild. 
---
he set a T-60 mod for 1800 caps.
---
FO4 established that you can turn into a ghoul at any time. Chems can cause it. I'd make the argument that both ghouls and scorched have lost their minds, to different degrees, and will pick up anything they find. Or they were your former vault co-dwellers and have been ghoul and scorchified after picking them up themselves....
---
Where is the fun in hunting someone who cant defend themselves?
---
Ok thanks
---
You right, I didn't think of that. :'( 
---
I wonder what solutions could be there for this? Maybe it won't let you put more items in your stash if you pass the upcoming 800 limit?
---
Classic con man move.
---
I mean, No Man's Sky got at least as much hate as it deserved, and in my opinion has since redeemed itself. A reputable company like Bethesda, not releasing its first game but in fact one very similar to one they already charged $60 for... One might start worrying we have an EA sports game situation on our hands. We don't even know for a fact that 76 will redeem itself the way games like NMS, FF14, Diablo 3 have done. It's simply an assumption based on standards those games have set. 
---
I think all criticism (hate) is absolutely deserved and consumers should be encouraged to voice their concerns. 
---
Yeah.  I used up a sizeable amount of ammo and broke my handmade.  Got like 17 meat and a whole shitload of springs.  I hate the bonging noise and the amount of stagger from their power attacks.  Being a ranged combatant normally, I was less than prepared to deal with that many yao guai at once.  Still managed to make it though.
---
np
---
This bug is true. However, IMO it's still one of the better 2 handed weapons. The super sledge does near equal damage at 100% but seems to pull you out of stealth for some unexplained reason. Even with 4x harder to detect while sneaking pieces, 3 in sneak, 1 in evasive, and 30 agility, you're easily detected. 
---
Check the list of recent people. The ones that are still on gives you the option to add to team. The ones they have left just say add friends. 
---
With the right mutations and perks it takes a LOT of hits from the ghouls to really hurt.   Radiation is a way bigger problem in nuke zones than damage from enemies, the hazmat even when broken gives a lot more protection than power armor.  I just jump into the fray with my ski sword and hazmat and let it rip.  If I get below half health I marsupial somewhere, stimpack and jump right back in.  
---
Yea, they always show up at the worst time 
---
I make a circle of the Three Ws and only do a few events. Gonna explain it all here. Hope this helps you and others. I'll tell you how I run each one and go into detail.
---
Watoga: Each building has a high chance of spawning a 3 star legendary. I check around Phoenix, go to to the high school, run through Emergency Services, and scour the Civic center. Also check the vendors for hidden gems other players sold.
---
West Tek: There's a chance for one outside, at least two legendaries guaranteed inside from what I have seen. High chance of being 3s. There's also 3 super mutants around the back, would make sense that they also have a chance for it.
---
Whitesprings: Everyone knows this one, but maybe they don't know the real route and just hit the golf club like I used to. I clear out the golf club, run down the green to the spot where you can find a hand sticking up out of a pit with a Nuka Cola Quantum. This will spawn 5 ghouls, sometimes one is a 3 star. Then I run down to the artisan shops and make the house loop, ending in the parking lot. Then I hit the vendors.
---
There's 3 events I will try to join if I hop into them: Cranberry Bog Hordes, AWOL Armaments, and Scorched Earth. These all guarantee a 3 star, and will always be lvl 50. Sometimes Horde is not lvl 50 but it depends on which type of enemy. Cranberry Bog always spawns the highest lvl enemies so I only bother doing them here. You should be able to figure out which types are worth it
---
Sign of a game needing less shards
---
Skyrim didn't feel a whole lot more advanced than Morrowind to me, and I mean that sincerely.
---
RemindME two weeks
---
Between that and me dumping stimpacks when I thought the game was too easy I made lots of people happy. But now that I'm in The Mire, I'm kicking myself for not holding on to all my drugs and .308 rounds. 
---
This is true, I’ve missed out on the fun of a Deathclaw gauntlet because of this
---
I bought 3 from a player. Think I paid 150 caps each. It is a great deal and you're able to just get the ones you want.
---
I have a PvP build that can tank hits from players under a pretty narrow set of conditions. It’s pretty easy to build out. PvP is just a rock, paper, scissors match. You were probably just playing rock on a paper build. 
---
It’s pretty common and it ultimately drives you to seek out team mates to diversify and force multiply.
---
Way to prevent this. Make cap limit 250,000. Make caps universal on all characters so they have access to them. No more capless alts causing trouble without consequences.
---
and people down vote this crap....next time I will just record the interaction and start reporting people.
---
Try r/market76 - busy trading community there
---
There's a loooot of ppl that play on pacifist mode, me included, so if you're shooting at them you're likely to just get ignored as to us you look like you're baiting. If you don't want the bounty play in pacifist and you won't have the issues or get a mic
---
Mash the interact button.
---
Ticks really creeped me out when i was new so they can squash all the bugs for all they care
---
..how about limiting number of alts and able create a new alts once per month after deleting the last one.
---
Yep, had a dude punching me (level 42) trying to bait me and my squad mate ( level 65), my mate said dont mess with him, he's probably got people standing by, lol, it's a run-of-the mill scam typically.
---
Beth was right, they do throw atoms at the players
---
Dont have a lot of time on break but 2 tips:
---
1. Most of your XP will come from killing enemies, the quests help more at the beginning but I suggest exploring the forest region and killing as much as you can. Taking a public workshop for the defend events is also helpful as it's at least one usually 2-3 waves of enemies all in one location and marked for you.
---
2. That being said if a player tries to take your workshop, especially if they're much higher than level 20 or so dont bother trying to stop them.  There was a fairly well known item duplication exploit and while the exploit no longer exists Betheada only got rid of the stockpiled OP gear.  All the people that bought OP gear from the people stockpiling it still have their OP gear.  This goes for any PvP really; the only people who actively seek out PvP use this duplicated OP gear.
---
I got wanted then went to a nuke zone.. kept getting downed... everyone kept stim packing me...
---
Ooh where did you find the hat?  I love finding interesting outfits! 
---
Not noticeably, even with a Bright one. 
---
Don't know that it's really reportable I mean people can do shity things. Raiders have been part of the Fallout world forever. The fact that you didn't fall for it is awesome and shows that people have a chance of not getting caught in it but it's not really a cheat or an exploit. 
---
By making human to human interaction a big focus of Fallout 76 Bethesda had to expect that some people would be up to this kind of shenanigans and I think it's kind of part of the game.
---
You didn't get caught and you've warned people which is pretty cool I think a lot of people are just not going to be as outraged by this as you expect.
---
My only issue with the atomshop is the goofy outfits. I need more gritty outfits that reflect our post apocalyptic world.
---
Did you buy digital copy or disc copy?
---
Thanos snap. 
---
Yes, this is what's causing it to happen to me too. Two handmade rifles with different legendary effects on them. What's interesting is the one that I have assigned to #6 gets moved to #5 and the one that was #5 is no longer favorited. So when I log in, #6 is empty.
---
U found a two shot the dragon, ‘‘twas a beast, until burr made it useless 
---
Digital 
---
digital
---
I like where it is now. Not being charged and editing your character anywhere, at anytime. It's quite refreshing considering nearly every game allowing this charges in-game currency and forces you to do it at specific locations. 
---
Some games don't even allow it (Destiny) and some games charge you up to an irl $15 to change your appearance (Elder Scrolls Online)
---
Fo76 has its problems but they did this right.
---
Same. The daily quests hardly ever pop up for me. 
---
I've been trying to do the hunting one in the toxic valley, but I haven't seen it in months.
---
99% certain I found it at Ft. Defiance/the asylum.  I had been there a few times before I found it, not sure if it's guaranteed but I never noticed it.  I want to say it was in a cell/room that I probably didn't check the first few times.  
---
It’s happening to a friend of mine too and have seen a bunch talking about it not registering them owning the game when they do. So was curious if it was a disc ownership issue as my friend has the disc copy. 
---
Personally I think it was a story choice it's only 25 years after the bombs and we're the first to leave a vault. Anyone not in a vault was wiped out by the scorched either becoming one or got killed by them. It makes sense to me that there wouldn't be people in Appalachia with all those factors.
---
&gt;But in game earned atoms are so abundant 
---
That whole &lt; 100 atoms per day. So abundant 🙄
---
Thats what 76 should have been...Co-op, not multiplayer.
---
If resources weren't wasted on pvp, pve would in theory be better than what it is now.
---
somethings wrong with their login server.  Had this message before but it went away.  Had it now for over two hours.
---
Platform?
---
Meat Hook and Death Tambo are better.
---
I’ve had no issues so far this weekend !🤞🏼
---
None of the items are essential, and the purifier and generator are for the lazy. Honestly by the time you're level thirty you're able to afford a few items. Maybe it could be cheaper sure but for all the items on the atom store are purely cosmetic. There's far more CAMP items available through the game itself.
---
People want to hate this game. Why can't we just agree to disagree
---
Good to see another mommie in the wasteland. 
---
Btw, can you install my crown moulding? Mmuuaah
---
Content? Sorry mate but I doubt there's going to be anything substantial coming to this game
---
mines digital too
---
I seriously hate thesound, it's so annoying,
---
Several reasons. 
---
1:  Bloodied builds can’t handle a bunch of rads easily while maintaining their low health/high rads balance. Hazmat suits make it significantly easier.   
---
2:  Perks like “Dodgy” and “Serendipity” provide chances to miss some or all incoming damage. “Nerd Rage” also provides DR when at low health.    
---
3:  Perks like “Barbarian” and “Evasive” provide boosts to DR without the need for armor.   
---
4:  Weapons like deathclaw gauntlets can’t be used in PA.    
---
Me and two teammates were alone on a server for hours the other day. I have grafton steel with no worries. Suddenly while at whitespring we noticed about a dozen dots on our map....within 5 minutes a team of two had killed us all with the workshop bug. Cool Game!
---
A little tip, learn where power armor spawns and just grab the fusion cores out of the frames. Make sure not to get in the frames or take any armor off or the system will register that you took it and it won't respawn for you for a couple days. Then you can server hop as needed and snag more cores. It seems taking the fusion core doesn't count as taking the suit so it doesn't have a cooldown for respawning. I actually took the core out of the same suit 3 times in a single play session over the course of a day on the same server. Obviously, if someone has beaten you to the frame, it'll be gone. Between this method and grabbing any I see laying around and other people dropping, I can't use my cores as fast as I get them. I do only wear my suit in the mire, bog, or ash heap, or when fighting a scorchbeast. I don't really need it anywhere else.
---
really hoping this is the case. dont really feel like starting over.
---
This is strange I sometimes get wanted on accident and I go up to ppl and just stand there low levels run away everyone else does nothing usually I have to wait untill my friend can get on so they can remove the wanted thingy
---
I've played for like 10 hours per day since launch. This is the first truly major thing I've experienced. Heres hoping it is just crappy authentication.
---
I like the first idea a lot!
---
Thanks very much. I'll start using this route!
---
K well sorry to hear but Glad I'm not alone.  6 wasted perk cards.  Those are like the heart of my build. Guess I'll replace them with bloody mess class freak and mysterious stranger... Meh
---
Eh. After patch 5 I stopped playing altogether, along with all the folks that I played with. That's probably why
---
The one thing i hate about it is how spread it they all can be
---
K
---
Gonna try and get home and get on. Thanks
---
Comparitively, while Skyrim doesn't offer some of mechanical complexity that Morrowind offered (or interactive complexity), it does by and large function much more smoothly and polished in its ARPG style.
---
Morrowind (and its hardly alone in that 1999-2002 glut of games) strives to do a lot of different things, and obviously has more complexity. But tons of it doesn't really mesh well together. And its usually either frustratingly obtuse, or horrifically broken (whether in amusing ways or irritating ways).
---
Thats not to say it didn't have good elements and ideas. And certainly it could be said that Bethesda was quick to abandon those ideas in favor of more easily refined ideas.
---
I don't think it'd kill the feel at all. If anything, I think it'd add to the wonder of vault 76. It's not like level 100s would be wondering in the areas outside the vault.
---
And the current state of starting the game in vault 76 is extremely lack luster. It's literally the most boring vault in any fallout game, yet it's the one the game is named after.
---
It needs to have a lot more added to it. I think the player hub proposal would do just that.
---
Also from a game design standpoint it is perfect.
---
You see all these high levels walking around with cool gear and skins and it gives the player something to strive for and internalizes a goal to make your character badass. 
---
Personally think instead of being able to mod burning damage onto energy weapons it should have been the effect given in place of explosive.
---
i’ll send you a party invite 
---
To players?
---
Levels 20-40 was the hardest part of the game for me. I snuck my way to Watoga at lvl 24 and got ambushed by scorchbeasts twice and died more times than I can count. Power Armor makes all the difference at this point in the game. Once I was over the hump, I stopped using it as much. Sounds like you are in the ash heap. Do the firebreather's quests down there (if you haven't already) and then head north to the toxic valley for a bit. That should be an area that more closely matches your abilities at this point. Spend some time exploring there and you should be good. Also, if you're all about the shotgun, grab the enforcer perk in all 3 levels. Cripple those legs and they can't come after you. Lets you hide and take pot shots from cover or kill melee enemies with your crappiest weapon at point blank.
---
i have the same issue right now, 250+ hours on my account and i rly don't know why this happening. I'm not into exploit/dupe
---
I feel like those are two very different experiences and don't translate well.
---
Especially, if it's one hour of farming white springs vs one hour of seeing the big new marvel movie or whatever.
---
Sorry- I meant to write the mod plans. On the plus side, I made a set for a helpful player who supplied their own mats. So I’m hopefully just a good nuke zone away from building my own
---
Thanks for the advice. I’ll have to be on the lookout for those things
---
Same here, nothing appeals very much, so I just buy something whenever I have a lot of Atoms. Not like I go looking for Atoms or would buy any. 
---
i'm in the same boat, i hope this is a server side issue
---
Hey mam, Fast Travel to Berkeley and go West until you see a trailer-home, inside the trailer is a dead body, and on his head is the Tin-Foil Hat. :) 
---
I just hit 1,000 screws lol
---
What was the name? 
---
A guy who wears a tin foil hat WOULD believe that it will bring more cryptid spawns...
---
I take over many workshops almost every session. 
---
I also noticed I lose about 20% of my damage when rad worm adrenaline wears off.
---
How are they using it wrong?
---
Maybe they think you are baiting them. There are a lot of carebears on this servers complaining about  "griefers" in a game that revolves around PvP and people can roleplay being a Raider.
---
Same. I had no weapon and I just sprinted away from everything until I found one. I ran away from ticks right into a camp of super mutants at that tower nearby lol. ‘‘Twas not a good start but hey, that’s how mafia works.
---
Isn’t that player are only able to engage in pvp once they are above lv5? 
---
How about increase it to lv15? 
---
If the system make the net return for making alts and grind them high enough lv less than playing the game normally, no one will be making alts just to be cashed and deleted.
---
If committing a crime net the same return as being a normal law obeying citizen every time, why would someone risk it? In real life there is always some criminal willing to gamble not being caught, but in game there is no chance for it to happen.
---
most player left this game when the weigth glich was fixed.
---
I think we should be able to put a card on the stash itself and you couldn't remove it if the stash would go overweight 
---
Ive only ever got this once and It let me try the SBQ solo. Pre explosive nerf my bloodied explosive shotgun and I did it in roughly 20 minutes. I've played for 900 hours on my main and this was without question the absolute highlight of Fallout 76 for me. Would love private servers so much.
---
That's shitty but if you think about it it's pretty flavorful. Your adrenaline wears off and you're tuckered out for a bit. 
---
FBI this is the guy right here
---
That's like yer opinion, man
---
Imagine a "Reactivate the air systems" in FO76. Where after a certain amount of people across all servers give their contribution the vault in the next update becomes a hub.
---
I wasn't calling you a prick.
---
The tone of a lot of posts addressing bugs etc I've read here have been malicious and mean-spirited, which is a sure way to get a very delayed or no response at all.
---
And maybe that's a reason why some issues are being pushed down a list of prorities.
---
Shitting on developers isn't exactly a great way to vent frustrations.
---
Since we're posting songs now, I think this is the perfect song for a bomb drop and letting loose with a 50cal! \m/ \m/

Be careful with picking too many quality of life (QoL) perks early on. For example, things that lower carry weight or help you build your camp or weapons/armor. These do nothing to help you get your build set up and you will have a rough time of things levels 20-40 if you venture out too far.
---
Also, take one of each level of the cards that add damage to your weapon of choice, to start with. For example, rifleman. Take one level of all three rifleman cards instead of three levels on one card. The percentage is higher doing one of each. If you know you are going to max out all 3 cards, than this advice is moot. But I am shotgun backup and I did 3 levels of one card and now I have to fix that to get a more optimized situation. Make sense?
---
You are very likely to get lock pick and hacker perk cards in perk packs. Since these are one rank each, it makes sense to use your perk picks elsewhere and hope you get them free in a pack.
---
Find Whitespring as soon as you can. Big white building almost dead center of the map. It's scary around the golf club at first, but there are places you can jump to get out of the range of the high level ghouls and can level up quick. It's safe inside the main building and people drop all kinds of stuff at the shops and all the vendors. A great place to pick up everyone else's discarded legendaries. Also, don't take the highway to get there. Unless you want to make friends with a scorchbeast or fall into a fissure (green glowing, smoking, crack in the ground) and lose all your junk.
---
I don't know if this suits your play style or not, but I wish I had hit level 50 before doing any of the quests. You get special, legendary named weapons and armor when you complete several of the quests and they are forever stuck at the level you were when you did it. If you are above 50, you'll get a maxed out weapon or armor. There's one weapon I got at lvl 20 that I would love to have a lvl 50 version of. (if anyone has a lvl 50 Perfect Storm, hit me up)
---
Also the 20 foot jumps and 30 mile per hour sprinting.
---
Ah, my bad. I haven't actively played in almost a month now, so I must have missed those notes.
---
Thank you! Do you mark the map or write it down? I almost instantly forget where power armor spawns. Maybe I should print a map. I'm trying to get into the mining company basement (again) to see if it has a right leg T-51 laying around. Is it only the excavator full suit that gives you the carry weight boost or any full suit?
---
Sorry lagging man,  i sent you a friend request but gonna be a while before i can play. 
---
I'm definitely inclined to agree with all that. I suppose I just felt equally unimpressed by Skyrim's mechanics as by Morrowind's, but I still loved both immensely... If it were a competitive game, certain things would be addressed, rather than excused, but I'm not playing it for that, and it would come at a cost. Hopefully that makes sense and I appreciate you responding.
---
My husband and I quit in frustration a month ago but came back a few days ago. We haven’t crashed or disconnected once. Several times an hour was common before.
---
They must have actually fixed something.
---
I got a 10 cap bounty near west tek this morning because a stray bullet hit a camp. I'm level 457 and hate PvP. People refuse to go near me when I have a bounty its super frustrating. The only way I manage to clear it is by getting it up even higher as incentive and hoping someone kills me.
---
I mean... yea it is. It’s nothing negative I just want cooler stuff in the atoms shop and I’m sure other people do too.  I just want to look like a badass warrior not a house decorator lol
---
I soloed my first silo yesterday at level 32 with super sledge and power armor (shit mix of raider and T-45 lmao), really felt like I shouldn't have been able to but it happened. I think they're still somewhat scaled to level even though they're harder than most areas in the game.
---
Ghoul slayers meat hook with the extra hook is incredible. 
---
I've had 3 AAE guns drop for me in 450 levels. 2 black powder pistols and a .45 SMG. I feel your pain.
---
i just waste 6point on strength and 3 on inteligence to reduce weigts.... instead able to use real perks cards...
---
This has been in the game since the Jan 31st patch. Its getting kinda silly how its almost a feature now.
---
There's a decent amount of high-ish level ghouls too. Not as high as Whiteprings but you know
---
I take over energy plants to farm 100/100 fusion cores.
---
same here, digital copy about 250+ hours
---
Lol! I can not argue with that! 😂
---
Lol it does you jus dont like it is what you mean
---
yep.
---
I love the idea of putting perk cards on the stash itself!! That would add another way to spice up your build. Maybe like a 3 card limit or something? 
---
The key ist not the 500 or 1000 rad resist here, it is the 98% rad reduction these suits provide. So you take nearly no damage from radiation ...
---
Oooh, for Whitespring that would be incredible.  I have a Troubleshooters for silos and Gutsys; also a Mutants with 40 swing speed that tears shit up.  Looking for an instigating hook.
---
Batteries Included
---
It use to trigger for me all the time with animation and noticed ap bar fill. Since last patch it has not worked one,  neither has four leaf clover.  
---
youd have to explain how charisma effects prices when trading with players
---
Know issue, have it documents and reported to Bethssda with exactly what they need to do for it to work.  
---
Additionally it effects the martial arts perk as well.

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Weapons - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aobkwm/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_weapons/)
---
Personally, at level 50, most of the things that take more than one hit to kill will have plenty of armor. I think it's a sure bet that the damage gained from AA will beat out the level 50 one.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h5vcJAOzWqA
---
Yeah just like have it start with one star and you can craft upgrades fo it in the build menu. And it can take any inventory weight perk depending on what you want to store
---
I found mine in the Ft. Defiance asylum
---
That’s what I was looking for ty...I used to have it on constantly and never got any of that
---
This. Honestly I am tired of the criticism around this period in the Gaming industry. Dont get me wrong, some games really are Pay or No Way to Win. But people went way overboard with the Starwars battlefront 2 hate for crates that unlock stuff that can be gained with 3 lost in a row of playing.... that shit was just blown way out of portion and the word of mouth of that stuff sabotaged the game. I dont want that same nonsense here. If Bethesda starts putting two shot explosive weapons on the atom shop then that's something I can get behind bashing, but here the atom points are handed to us like nothing. Bbn i pay to get it quicker and support development. 
---
Same issue on my account as well right now 
---
Sometimes I go in with a hazmat suit when I'm low on radaway.
---
I play with a shotgun build, so I can kneecap bloated glowing ones easily, they're harmless once they're lying on their bellies on the ground.
---
But it works!  I swear! You gotta believe me!
---
I wonder if Bethesda has said anything about the possibility of anything like this? 
---
Your lack of reading comprehension continues to amaze. 
---
IE patch 5, way to point out one footnote bro.
---
I hope they do something like this 
---
I have a very visual memory so I remember every one I find. There are several websites that have maps. I won't give you the url in case you're like me and don't want location spoilers. But if you do, google is your friend or let me know and I'll send you the links.
---
All power armor gives a slight strength boost which translates to a minor increase in carry weight. But he excavator gives +100. If you can find the calibrated shocks mod (they will just say 'calibrated shocks' and will not say 'excavator' in their name) you can add +50 to each leg for a +200 total bonus. I think I found them at the Camden park vendor. The excavator armor also gives you a quantity boost to any ore you mine as well.
---
All the damn time. 
---
Nice, wish my TSE was an automatic of some sort - mine's just a double-barrel. Wallops things real dead if you hit em, sure, but it's *ridonculously* inaccurate.
---
Don't really consider anything a bullet sponge besides the queen with normal guns and psychopath you can just mow through enemies like there nothing.
---
It doesn’t sound like you’re gaming the system to do it though. For example, if you’re looking for a challenge, trying to get a player to accidentally hit you and then kill them with one hit isn’t going to be very fulfilling. If you’re just using pvp, there is certainly nothing wrong with that. 
---
The issue really is with poor game design in several areas. 
---
Cant think of anything aside from queen thats a sponge. Any thing else, test your armor penetration
---
I think they meant if it's your first server firing up the game. The old recents go away if you exit the game, so upon your first server the recents should show everyone on there and no more.
---
This... this is... abso*flute*ly beautiful.  
---
But seriously, nice work.  
---
Bullets not working?  Maybe try a different approach.  
---
The only sponge is the SBQ and only because you have to force her to land.  Anything that can't fly is easy game with most any build.
---
Shit sounds pretty awesome to me
---
Holly shit, it looks amazing 
---
If you can enter the Whitesprings Bunker, go to the Science wing. There you will find several different types of serum recipes.
---
Xbox is fading too, Thanos snap is hitting hard. At this rate, we won’t need private servers when you can just load into empty sessions.
---
There are bullet sponges in the game? 
---
Frankly I figured it was to keep rendering individual faces and outfits down. Every Mr. Handy basically looks alike, ditto the French nanny bots and White Springs maids. The Holo tapes are audio only so they don't require any visuals. 
---
Since just about every other thing in this game is a reused asset (I'm assuming to keep costs down), I figured this was just another cost cutting measure.
---
other people having a good time and joking around?? we cant have that here because *i* dont like it
---
Yeah, there’s a full guide on google.com
---
Ppl dont like how you think lol  but I agree the stale PVE content this game has is jus small time filler. 
---
And player only, death by their turrets doesn't do it.  :(
---
obligatory "bethesda ruined fallout"
---
upobsidians to the left xd
---
Well, since no one really plays this game anymore, hardly surprising. When you drive everyone away, not surprising when it becomes single player 
---
I always have tons of everything.... Except acid.. Always running out 
---
then the card would be useless
---
Same here 
---
I put in a support ticket and they made me re install the game and then escalated my ticket because that didn’t help.
---
At the nuka cola plant there's usually four power cores if nobody has taken them. One on the roof at the rear exit, above the loading bay.
---
Then go in the rear exit, there's a suit of power armour.
---
Head to the room behind the power armour there's a core in a generator then in the same area a core just on the side in a caged off bit.
---
Then if you leave the plant via the rear exit (loading bay) and head west, there's a small farm with another power Armour core.
---
When I was low I'd set my camp up in this area so whenever I logged on I could get 5 power cores when I logged in if I was lucky. 
---
You also can choose to respawn in a diff loc
---
Same thing happened to me, despite several attempts with veil on I couldn’t get in again after I’d finished the questline. I hoped it was a bug but haven’t tried again since.
---
I'm having the same issue on my xbox. Game hard crashed on me and I can't login on that character/account. My alternate accounts are fine. New account works fine. I'm uninstalling overnight in Hope's of fixing this. My idea is that the server still thinks I'm logged in after the disconnect and is stopping me from coming on twice. Maybe when that specific server resets it will be over... I've had friends say they have gotten this message and played again later. 
---
I have also been banned on two accounts, the error message is not the same for this issue.
---
I'm glad it's getting attention now, maybe and I think, this could be an issue on their end since the latest patch just came out a day or two ago.
---
Trade off is if it’s on your stash you can’t have it apply to your inventory. Card can only be in one place. 
---
After 5 hours of frustration I uninstalled and set the reinstall to go overnight.
---
I would take that actually seems more than fair 
---
This would be the same issue on 3 platforms now, PC xbox and ps4
---
not something to be proud of tbh
---
I listened to everyone in prior Bethesda games and almost none of the holotapes in this one. 
---
The holotapes aren't interactive, so I find them less engaging.
---
I had already heard that everyone is already dead, save the players, so that knowledge removes any sense of urgency to my gameplay.
---
You can't pause the holotapes or fast forward the holotapes so in an always-in-potential-danger game, I tend to only play the holotapes long enough to get the next quest marker to activate, while keeping my danger sense alert in the meantime.
---
Sometimes I play in a team and my teammates frequently talk over the tapes playing. 
---
Instead, I just read the story online, in peace and quiet.
---
I mean, sorry for not being up-to-date on the extents of legitimate leveling. That doesn’t remove the validity of any of these issues. Chill. 
---
blackbird is the new skulltrooper meme
---
There are better places to get lead. When I need it, I farm the silos. Usually get about 100 pieces worth per trip. 
---
Elevator down, grab lead while in PA w/ CS. Equip “Pack Rat” lv3, then fast travel back to the nearest train station. Do this 3 times daily (once for each silo) and I’ve been well stocked since. 
---
it's just the campfire trick, just upwards and way longer. i assume you'd have to move your actual camp space higher up sometime during it too
---
they made a video on it, but it's a little drawn out but i could send it if you'd like
---
Same here on PC, a lot others too. 
---
Addendum:  if you’re sneaky, you can do the whole process without ever firing a shot. 
---
I killed a player with a bounty and he tracked me back to my camp and tried to kill me. He got another bounty on his head for it and I killed him again as he was running away. He sent me all these hate messages I just laughed. I had a lot of fun with it either way. But was pissed he acted like such a baby. 
---
If the workshop wan't taken how did they build the benches, stash, turrets?
---
I don't understand.
---
900 hours? Someone is trying save you lol
---
Well, some stuff is buggy and not described properly. Nothing free over xmas holidays when other completely f2p games at least gave a gift. At the same time using shady (and in the UK illegal) business practices falsely advertising limited time pricing etc. Not to mention in Australia where I live one premium PA paint is the equivalent of $29 so no thankyou.
---
Custom user radio that reads song files from a local folder.
---
Yep. Got rolled once like this. Opened up with a TSE mini (pre-nerf) and his health barely moved.  
---
He fired 1 TSE shotgun blast at me, I died and heard my 200% PA go to shambles. I was fortunate enough that my helmet and torso were still intact. I hear a second shot before I can respawn. Torso broke too.
---
I have this axe, as well, and the bug is true. 
---
Not to mention there's scraps of that companion app all over the action script files for fallout 76.
---
If I remember correctly junk in FO3 is pretty much useless and just to sell. There's a few npcs that will give you caps for 10 of a certain item. Also if I remember correctly nula quantinums are limited. 
---
I want private servers JUST for this reason. Me and my friend can run around alone, roleplay together and not get bothered by anyone else!
---
Camp wrecker.  Can’t be killed either due to Assassins/Sentinel Set and probably teamed back up, allowing him to just continue increasing his bounty ad infinitum.  Probably also broke, so if anyone does collect, they’ll get nothing. 
---
Beware. Some are master baiters.
---
As a level 90 who visits flatwoods for lead, you're harvesting lead wrong. 
---
If a player can legitimately randomly destroy a pacifist player’s base and there’s absolutely nothing they can do to stop you, and the game punishes the player whose base is getting destroyed by making them lose their level in caps every time they’re killed hopelessly trying to defend it, there’s an issue with the game. It certainly isn’t benefiting from any of the ‘anti-greifing’ measures reported, and is antithetical to how Bethesda claimed the game was going to be designed. 
---
That’s the issue here, not whether or not someone is cheating. 
---
How does that happen? I NEVER have that happen.
---
Can confirm.  Bug is true and sucks. I want my ghoul slayers grognak axe to kill whitesprings zombies at maximum efficiency. 
---
Trueeee
---
Some of them seem to be bugged. Not sure which, or if its even the same for each player.
---
Just why?
---
not yet still hoping....
---
I agree with this wholeheartedly, bravo 
---
because I can?
---
Except for the actual bounty
---
Nope. Won’t even get that. The bounty is taken from the wanted player’s caps. If he has less than his bounty, you get whatever he has on him.  4k bounty but only has 5 caps?  Congrats bounty hunter. You’ve killed public enemy # 1. Here’s 5 caps. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0axrp/power_armor_x01_mod_list/?utm_source=reddit-android

Although this talks about the x-01 the info is relevant 👍
---
Every time I kill an enemy with a bounty I got the described number of caps even from my broke friends
---
There are propaganda flyer in the game.
---
And your post looks like propaganda Pro-fo76. 
---
I guess that's what he means.
---
I had a similar situation happen. The whole server disconnected except my buddy. So me, and 2 others joined on him and we had a private server for 8 hours. Held each major work shop. It was awesome
---
Ahhhhhh..... to dream a dream! That would be wonderful.
---
Roleplay being a raider? LMAO!  
---
That's only if you consider raiders to be bottom-feeding losers who trick their way into forcing unconsensual pvp onto people who are completely unprepared and unwilling.   
---
If the game revolves around PVP, why is it so utterly unrewarding, unskillfull, and completely dependant on duped gear to stand still in?
---
Well I have encountered a few bullet sponges but nothing with special fighting strategies, tactics, moves  or thing that would make it a long lasting fight without them eating my ammo
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Basically I somewhat agree with this post but not to the degree this guy describes
---
Then you were fortunate to have a glitch or they were lying about their caps. I’ve seen this in both regular PvP and with wanted player interaction from both sides.  
---
I’ve had a player who was made broke (by me) in PvP because he wouldn’t leave me alone. After he went broke dying for the hundredth time, I got 0 caps from killing him, despite the fact that I was level 10 (my alt) and he was 29. 
---
On my main I ran with one of these guys to get an idea of how they were doing it and better learn to fight back (spoiler:  the moral of “War Games” was the answer).   He would intentionally deplete his caps by passing them off to his buddy. I accidentally clipped him once and collected. I got part (teamed) of the 10 or so caps he had on him.  His bounty was around 500. 
---
If the game paid out in full, then the mechanic could be used as an exploit. Two get in party chat but don’t team. One wrecks peoples houses but has no caps. Friend collects exorbitant bounty and passes part of it to the camp wrecker’s mule until they’re done. 
---
All my friends got in finally after support fixed their acts mine is still ficked.
---
Should've had that red power armor paints t that's in the promotional scene with the t51 in military paint and with the excavator reveal
---
A whole solid 20 minutes? Wow. Try staying in the easier areas west of the map until you level up.
---
I have a sledgehammer with 200 dmg and it doesn’t seem to move the queen HP any single bit. Am I doing it wrong or what?
---
OK basic PvP I got zero caps from those who are broke but bounties I always get the described amount
---
So do I. My style of play is stealth with VATS / crits so I crouch pretty much permanently. 
---
IIRC the only one Bethesda had came out and said was fine was the map changing one. For a higher quality map.
---
What level are you?
---
How does that work? I mean once you do the first shot the enemy will find you and start running towards you along with other gang members. Right?
---
Can we add some Nekromantix and Calabrese too? 
---
^
---
 |
---
 👍 
---
This is what I think it is, as another pointed out... a player took the workshop, built it then either was killed, left the world or game and the workshop was available but what they built was still there. 
---
Tonight at Poisiden plant was exactly that... it was all built and powered up. I took it and took the cores and everything else, didn't have to do anything... 
---
Guess they left it??
---
I was there. I was just crouched behind you the whole time. 
---
The saw ESO charging 50 dollars for mounts and 100 dollars for instanced houses and wanted some of that.
---
I'm gonna be on in around an hour will you still be on then? 
---
Usually people won't be willing to listen to others. Nice experience. It was a bit hard to follow, but you'll get better at your writing if you keep it up and share more positive experiences! =)
---
But it sounds GREAT for a Fallout game.
---
I like the idea of a boss wave defence but it would make it hell for low levels unless the boss scaled depending on the owners level
---
should be
---
Excellent my GT is the same as my reddit 
---
Used to get a lot of these with different various error codes.... Only thing that helps is time (never took more than 5-6 hours for me) or if you have a friend with Xbox live and the game, then log in with their account and then switch to yours after you in
---
&gt; You could have responded less aggressively. 
---
It is the internets. If your information is even a little bit off or vague get ready to be salted down and fried in the fallout 76 community. Dont worry its true many lvl200+ characters have abused exp exploits but it is possible. Some people were just more dedicated to farming exp then others. Some people also farmed the heck outta whitesprings when it offered 700 exp per Ghoul. 
---
Im personal lvl 199 with a level 50 and 15 alternate character. I don't know anyone over 250 though on ps4 personally but its do-able. Over 400 is pushing it though and begs the question like you suggested. 
---
It's a shame this game is compete garbage.  I'm glad a slim few players are still playing even with all the bugs and exploits.  I used to love Fallout and really wanted this game to succeed...  ****Ing Bethesda cash grab =(
---
I'm having the same issue but could log into my alt just fine. I'm on Xbox though. Not sure what to do. Bethesda told me to check my internet connection..
---
Yeah but you can pick off most enemy mobs before they reach you without leaving crouch. You get the sneak dmg bonus when crouched, even if they've spotted you. Plus, with high agility, you can easily lose enemies again. 
---
Yeah, this game requires at least 2 hour sessions to get anything done.
---
BaNnEd
---
Some perk cards are level specific. I’m not sure if the perks you’re looking for are non-level specific but I highly doubt it. Hopefully that helps you,
---
It helps that I don't want 90% of the items in the Atom Shop to begin with. I don't even want most of what's been datamined. 
---
Shut up 
---
Just messaged about 3 serums, GT is Furious Sausage.

Bethesda support told me to check my internet connection.. lol
---
Yeah. Got off xbox around 4:20 ( hehe ) PST since then I haven't been able to log on either. My wife's account on the same xbox can but not mine.
---
Do you want a list of what we want in advance?
---
Why solo??? Find some people to play with on here, it’s the whole point! You won’t enjoy it AT ALL otherwise!!!
---
How bout a radio station that plays  all the "Tales from the West Virginia Hills" tapes? 
---
My wifes can as well 
---
Has anyone seen a quad Gamma gun? I think this is the one I want. Been scrolling though old post but can’t find this particular set up. 
---
I don't get the "I want to be alone on the map" thing. When I play, I easily spend hours without seeing anyone, and when I finally find someone, he/she is nice and don't try to interact more than a little. 
---
6 hours alone on a server is suspicious too. Perhaps there were people crouched all around you, waiting for you to die to steal your gears and feast on your corpse?! :)

**Shotgunner** is a Perk Card in Fallout 76. This Perk has 3 ranks with increasing cost in Strength.
---
To use this Perk Card your character has to be at least **level 10**.
---
I am level 10 and I don't see it.  What am I doing wrong here?
---
Possible solution: Weight reduction perks become permanent passive bonuses once acquired and no longer have to be equipped.

sure. it'll speed up the process

pre nerf you didn't want to even try this, was an automatic kill on yourself with any shotgun, lever or handmade.

*THIS* and the mirelurk hunters which douse you in their acid that also seems to instantly melt whatever it touches. 
---
I was defending bog town last night and I used up all of my ammo and stimpaks. 
---
Worst enemies in the game no doubt.
---
On the contrary, I feel this would help people create more diverse builds instead of everyone worrying about to make room for "required" perks.   
---
Couple of days ago I was fighting a scorchbeast near Watoga Station and I guess I shot up some dude's workshop in the process and I got a 10¢ bounty. I just fast traveled to Whitespring Station and stood there like an idiot until someone came by. He clearly wasn't sure what to make of me and I think he sat there for a good 20 seconds before deciding to pull the trigger. When I respawned I gave him a big ol' thumbs up.
---
As an aside the way this game decides who an asshole is is completely screwed up.
---
Saw a guy on PC advertising the ability to craft ALL shielded underarmors a few weeks ago...sent him a msg asking him how he got hold of theCasual and got a smug “lots of caps” in answer.
---
Is it confirmed that they're actually saying something in mandarin?
---
I was chatting to a bloke the other night who told me his daughter (fallout player and (non-native) mandarin speaker) couldn't get anything from what they were saying.... 
---
No I was defending a workshop near the cranberry bog. It was a level 63 three star legendary (I'm lvl 75). But I remember having similar troubles in the Wendigos cave at low levels. 
---
Text chatting... What is that?
---
Yeah, that's not true. At all. Solo is fun as well, it all depends on what you prefer.
---
Nope been in 7 blasts no trophy yet
---
WTF Bethesda/ps?
---
But they could just hire musicians to make the songs solely for the game, especially if it’s like sea shanties or something. The raider radio on FO4 was decent until you heard it too many times. It wouldn’t be that hard to hire a few musicians to write folk songs specifically for the game. 
---
I mean, I’m a musician looking for work, they could even hire me 🤔
---
I feel that the game is primarily focused on the player interacting with others, as much of their dialogue and system seems to revolve around it (sharing perk cards, bartering, raids.) Is it possible you can explain the entertaining aspects of solo? I’ve tried it but it was unbearable for me.
---
Yabvone came through! 
---
Can’t you do that already with Spotify? At least on consoles? 
---
Can't remember where I got mine from but if you want me to craft you any under amour let me know if your on Xbox

Great write-up buddy.  I forgot about the lucky hole for lead. Been searching around for legendaries since am level 63 and best legendary weapon so far is a fat man that weights 90% less.

I have a friend who regularly buys atom shop... everything. One day I was taking pictures to grind out some challenges, which he never bothers with? He didn't have anything but the basic poses for photo mode, so he went and bought them all. All this, despite the fact that he never even uses photo mode unless we're hanging out.
---
He sees it as supporting a game he enjoys. I... would rather grind. Ha.
---
Thank you for taking the time to share this!
---
Ya, I won't spend money for the Atomic shop either.
---
I can't speak for others, but the reason I have a problem with it is this. 
---
1. Bethesda was made famous by the modders. The potential of this game coupled with the ability to mod this game created a environment where after you played the game you could legit go in and "fix" the bugs you found. Or make new quests (so you could continue playing). Or houses. Or Sim Settlements. Or Nude mods. Modder's making free content and sharing it with the public generated most of Bethesda's success.
---
2. Bethesda made the mistake of listening to some idiot who said it'd be a good idea to capitalize and make money off the modding community. They then tried 3 separate times of introducing different types of Atomic shops where they tried to make as much money from mods for as little effort as possible.
---
3. Bethesda couldn't be arsed to even pretend that the above #2 was for any reason other than greed.
---
4. Bethesda announced Fallout 76 as a online AAA title game they created from scratch.
---
5. Bethesda released Fallout 76 and anyone with 1.2 brain cells quickly realized  this was Fallout 4, on a new map...and that was about it. The quests are over super quick (/cough DLC size). To make matters worse, there has been rumours that after some digging into the files of Fallout 4, the guts of a "online mode" was found. Meaning they could of released Fallout 4 with the added mod of a co-up or online mode.
---
6. Bethesda double downed on Fallout 76 by introducing the Atomic shop. Where it was revealed they stripped outfits that was previously in the base game to resell for a obscene amount of money (or credits). These Bethesda "mods" are a insult to anyone who's played this game on a computer and has modded Bethesda games in the past. They take things that literally takes you longer to open the file in GIMP than it does to create (the recolors) and charges $4-6 for this. A lot of us feel they are pissing on their fanbase and laughing while doing it. 
---
7. Bethesda is now creating mods that takes maybe 1-3 minutes to create from scratch and turning this out as "content mods". All while not releasing the tools they have always previously released because it would 100% end any use for the current Atomic shop. (Nexus already has better mods/outfits than what the Atomic shop has and this is all free with you being able to donate money to the modder if you wish but it isn't required). 
---
Just writing this made me mad at Bethesda all over again. And the final take away, I do still currently play this game. I bought the Trincential version ($80 version) which was a 100% ripoff for the content I received, but I did so hoping they would do their fanbase right as it seemed (before the game released) they was listening and making course corrections. This proved false, I feel lied to, and them releasing the exact same outfit I own in Fallout 4 (and is already in Fallout 76's files) and wanting me to spend anything on it seems petty and greedy to the extreme.
---
Love posts like this :) thanks for taking the time to help us who also love the game just as much
---
Soooo didn’t Fallout 4 have logic gates? I feel like Beth was worried and straining the servers, otherwise I’m not sure why they stripped out these features.
---
Also on the power counters... yeah really they are so broken. And the random switch... might have been interesting if I could drive it with an electrical input, but a manual switch?! That’s beyond useless unless I’m missing something.
---
I think that Beth doesn’t have anyone who knows enough about electrics/electronics to implement these things correctly. So I fear we may never get a fix.
---
Maybe a mod to change the coloring?  I use a mod that changes the PA chassis to a darker gun-metal color and it makes a really nice difference in visual look in my game.  Could be something similar?
---
That means...not enough people playing the game 
---
This is gonna be a great summer!
---
I killed a wanted high level at Whitesprings as he was preparing to enter a blast zone. I didn’t realize he had a group and he had them all start shooting at me immediately. I luckily fast traveled back to my camp without dying, but they ended up following me. They started wrecking my camp! I quickly left the server, but the damage had been done. People are so childish. And let’s be real...I did you a favor!
---
The problem with people who do shit like that is that they wreck it for the rest of us.  Generally, if I encounter a new player, they don't have voice chat, so I'll try to initiate a trade to get a better idea of what I can give them.  See what gun they're using, give them appropriate ammo.  See they need water, give water.  If they don't trade because they're afraid of everyone they encounter, they get nothing... unless I'm in my Nuka Cola Power Armor... then they get a Nuka Wild &amp; a Blank Feedback Form.
---
THIS would be really cool.  It's a tradeoff so not overpowered.  People would get the choice of hoarding in the stash, or hoarding on their body (which has the benefit of the resistance junk perk, but the detriment of losing junk upon death).  Give us choices!

Are you on Pc? I’m interested in having a look at your camp. 
---
You can activate the random switch remotely with a pressure plate though, just make sure that the random switch is always on the on state when nkt powerrd. That way It's still got 50/50 odds every new time you activate it. I don't see why logic gates woukd strain the servers though. 
---
Yes I'm on PC. PM me for my discord. 
---
Stay in the green area on the map until you're higher level, kill stuff, do events and level up your guns and armor.  I went to whitesprings at level 25 and learned real quick that certain areas are off limits at lower levels.
---
And what about perks that add weight reduction and another effect, like Martial Artist or Scattershot? 
---
Yeah. I'm on PC. 
---
I've only played solo and am level 63 now.  Lone wanderer perk, baby.
---
My TSE Gatling gun did 700 dmg before the nerf. I could one shot just about anything that was below lvl 40 and not legendary. Using the anti armor perks that thing was super over powered and led to me one shorting myself on numerous occasions. After the nerf I like it more than I did previously. It does 168 dmg now which is still pretty damn OP. The lower damage gets me playing more rather than just rolling up and murdering everything in 20 seconds. Being able to shoot things point blank is also a plus from the nerf. 
---
You open it up hoping for a Anti-Armor knife or fork, but get a TSE tupperware lid instead.
---
Tweak em. 
---
PC.
---
**Silos.** I wouldn't say the silos bugged out, although I don't know what the resistances look like when a group does a silo. Maybe the game thought it was a group attack. Or this is by design as I never run the same silo more than once on a server before.
---
**Solo server.** Others have also reported they were left alone on a server. This is not the game server's fault, but the load balancer that assigns logging in players to world instances. Maybe the balancer does not properly reduce player counts once they leave.
---
**Loot stats.** So far, I had 74 Armor  (55.22%) drops of 134, 22 Ranged (16.41%). Of the armor: 
---
* 12 Wood (16.21%), 
---
* 15 Raider (20.27%)
---
* 13 Left Leg (17.56%)
---
* 12 Right Leg (16.21%)
---
Level wise
---
* 101 w/ 1\* Enemy (75.37%)
---
* 7 w/  2\* Enemy (5.22%)
---
   * 3 w/ 2\* drops (42.85%)
---
* 27 w/ 3\* Enemy (20.14%)
---
   * 6 w/ 2\* drops (22.22%)
---
   * 11 w/ 3\* drops (40.74%)
---
Lol
---
Considering how easy it is to make 2mm ammo (only needs lead and steel) I've actually made the build work with only 200-500 rounds depending on what my routine is, I actually overstocked because I made too many rounds lol, wishing I used those materials on plasma cartridges, less weight and the plasma flamer blows through them like waterfalls deposit water.
---
Yeah, some new tunes would help. Something to keep it fresh.
---
It's all about the mods baby!  As soon as mods can be officially made for the game, hopefully it will let us create our own stations (like in FO4).  Right now I think the modders can only swap songs with the ones that are there (and they have to match similar play times I think).  Official Mod support cannot come soon enough.
---
The only problem I have with it is when they do the limited time items and I haven't got the money at that time they should do it on rotation or something so people don't miss out
---
You make perk cards that don't have a cost to equip, and every player in the game will have them equipped at all times. And tbh, the weight reduction perks aren't really that essential once you break the habit of looting everything not nailed down. 
---
Thanks for writing this up, if you don't mind PM'ing or sharing here. Where did you find your explosive shotguns? I'm lvl 274 now and I've yet to get one.
---
&gt;You make perk cards that don't have a cost to equip, and every player in the game will have them equipped at all times.
---
And? 
---
Do you have discord?
---
I wonder if there are many solo players who don’t use power armor? I don’t use power armor and I get destroyed often.
---
I have had similar experiences. What I find worked in the past for me is to run to Charleston Station and just start asking in Area chat for someone to kill me. I can usually find someone passing through who helps me out right away.
---
Thanks for all these Infos. Will try out a few ...
---
Well, there is a way that uses minimal conduit(Hopefully you have the advanced power plans and don’t want to use conduit cause it’s a pain in the ass).
---
There are these two conduit end pieces that have a wiring point on them. One has the wiring point pointing up, and it attaches to floors easily. The other has the wiring point pointing down.
---
First place the pointy up one on an upper floor then attach the pointy down one to the first one. Not you can attach a wire on either side and it will pass electricity through!
---
Good read, lot's of interesting info.  Thanks for posting this!
---
I like the atom shop also. The only problem i have with it is the limited timed stuff, like the lumberjack outfit. The items should be permanent.
---
Ive had 3 pump actions, a double barrel and a combat shotgun as explosive. I clearly remember getting the first pump action at the NAR trainyard. The double barrel was so long ago i can't remember. The combat shotgun was from west tek about 3 weeks ago. The most recent pump action was from west tek too.
---
And i got a level 25 instigating pump action doing a horde event in the ash heap. Gave this to a friend.
---
I work for the IDA (Internet Definitions Agency) and I just grepped your statement, turns out this definition of 'mad at the internet' is not accurate. Carry on.
---
Yesterday I joined a "defend workshop" event with its owner.
---
Guy is lower level than I am (and I am 36, that's my alt). We defend the place then after the event is over, he starts shooting at me. His turrets attack me and I take some damage (not much but still).
---
I'm pacifist enabled all time.
---
I don't know how damage and PvP work. I don't care.
---
The guy shoot at me, so I take out my anti Armor fatman and put two mininukes in his face.
---
He took less than a quarter of life bar in damage.
---
Then I got wanted for 70 caps.
---
I don't get how that shit works. But it seems broken.
---
Lol nice! Thats no easy feat.
---
Imagine each faction getting their own radio, and getting their own set of music.
---
I hear ya, though I'm not pissed about anything.  It seems like since guns don't level past 50 and since you don't get any more special points, they kind of force you into swapping your quality of life cards for ones that increase your primary weapons' dammage.  
---
Like I already had the first level of the 3 rifleman cards and first level of bloody mess and tank killer cards and at level 60 was dumping at least 10 rounds of 5.56 into every lowly scorched I came across.  
---
Would be nice if guns and armor level past 50, since mobs do, or not make it necessary to completely dump every perk point towards increasing dammage to continue on with the game after level 50.  
---
 I've not run into anything in the game that's impossible to do solo, so I never really had the need to team up with anyone. The people I usually play games with are not into Fallout at all so that might be part of the reason I'm going solo. 
---
But, as I've said, it all depends on what one prefers. 
---
Yeah, the game basically forces you to pick a primary weapon and invest at a minimum of 6 points into cards that increase that weapon's dammage and or decrease enemy armor.
---
And don’t forget the part where they have their buddy hold their caps so they don’t lose any and they kill each other to launder their wanted bounty.
---
It is pretty broken... but weren’t people complaining that raiders weren’t a thing in the game. Haha
---
Berserker builds. 
---
I'm not generally into "farming" for items, but here's what I do.  I always start/end at my camp as it is my home in this world in a fairly permanent location.  I stock up on a ton of corn, make some soup, then hit the nearby areas where Fusion Core's can be found (grabbing a handful of other needed meds/scrap along the way).  Then I check the map.  If there's a nuke, I'll suit up and head that way to help fight whatever, grab some flux &amp; stuff, and enjoy taking down some giant beasts with other players.  Then I'll do a bit of a "vendor circuit" depending on how much I have to sell (Watoga x2, Whitesprings x2, then maybe Flatwoods and Free States).  If there's new players around, I'll try to give them stuff or help them with whatever they're doing.  Otherwise, I'll pick a random area that I haven't fully explored and just go check it out, and remind myself that this is still mostly a single player game full of random weird sidequests and lore to discover.  When I'm done playing, I head back to camp, fix my stuff and manage my inventory.  Oh, and I try to hit the Soda Fountain whenever I'm there for that sweet sweet Nuka Grape Cola.  
---
The point is, figure out what it is that YOU like about the game, and do that.  Contrary to popular opinion, there is actually a lot of stuff to do here.  
---
Exactly. If you are active player, atoms just pile up. People be like "Ohh, these prices are too high for me to spend money". Then Beth halves the prices and what happens is that people are still not spending the money, because atoms come relatively easy to come. Well, for me it is good, but for them this is stupid. And the thing is, if everyone can get X skin for so easy, then the skin loses its uniqueness. F76 playerbase think they are entitled for easy skins, no they are not. Skins are not mandatory content or something you should be entitle to get.
---
But also, even if they stopped giving out Atoms and lowered the prices to few euros per armor skin, would I spend money on skins? No, not on this game. This game is so casual with meaningless content and its playerbase is joke, who cry over every little thing, I would never spend money on skins in this game.
---
I wonder if the GTAV trick can work on FO76 for Xbox?
---
For those who don't know, test your NAT type on your xbox and you'll be booted into your own server on GTAV. Wonder if it works for 76?
---
I had a guy who started clearing an area with me than as I was shooting at the last super mutant, he kept running in front of my line of fire, hoping I'd shoot him on accident.  I'd wait till he moved then as soon as I started shooting again, he'd jump in front of the guy again.  Was rediculous.  It's like seriously, you're that hard up for caps?!
---
Been having the exact same thing. I thought most mobs would scale to my level until my bf told me the reason everything was getting harder was because we were venturing into higher level locations. Whitespring and cranberry bog are NOT good locations for newbies unless you have an entourage of high level players 
---
Post saved, thanks a million
---
Try to be level 373 and have people trying to farm you wherever you go, nevermind if you dare to own a workship. I'd have to kill a level 100 player at a ratio of more than 3.7:1 to come out ahead which of course isn't happening. All because in consensual PVP, what is at stake is your level in caps.
---
Lucky Hole mine, excavator suit. 
---
I got wanted once by accident when peeking at someone's base. I just went to a train station, stripped naked, put all my crap in the storage box, went back outside and sat in a chair. Took about 10 minutes and a player solved my wanted problem.
---
+karma
---
I find that going on your pipboy and turning the mission off and on again helps with glitches during missions. Had it a few times myself where things would glitch during some of her missions and I couldn’t progress because it was stuck with on one thing or another 
---
I don't think time has been an issue for this guy
---
Absolutely or if the stash wasn't limited to 600.  I'd pay $20 to up my stash upped to 2000lbs.  Hint hint, Bethesda
---
I would hate if Bethesda implemented something like that 
---
Yeah, I'd buy from other players if I was after multiple mutations.  Otherwise you risk getting the wrong mutation doing it the old fashioned way and have to start over.  
---
I have definitely heard this damned sound multiple times when not playing the game.
---
I will NEVER spend money on microtransactions. How hard or easy to get the points are doesn't change my likelihood (zero) or buying Atoms. 
---
You have some valid points and I agree with some bits but labelling normal game mechanics exploits just reeks of desperate click baiting.
---
You saw me? 
---
Think of it like this, your comment kinda goes against what the guy you replied to said, maybe that hurt his ego so now he's gonna start PM'ing you calling you every name under the sun threatening to kill you and your family and getting other members to come and downvote all of your stuff.  
---
Do you think thats the kind of attitude that should go unchecked?
---
Sometimes must be vanishingly small chance as I've used that vendor hundreds of times across my characters and never seen the excavator version. You do VERY occasionally get one of the T- versions though.
---
Same here. The rate of atoms you get could be a little bit higher tho.
---
I really changed my mind about atom items with the new Camp decorations.
---
Actualy with right perks and silencer they wont find You. Stealth rifle build is so powerful. Thats my main build. Usualy one shot per head on scorched, ghouls. Scorchbeasts make me laugh as they wont see You and You headshot them on vats crit all the time. Having only action lever rifle lvl 45, not even a legendary, I can in 5 sec headshot 5 diff mobs.
---
Imagine that all of the things in the atom shop were given away for free after completing challenges (collect 10 power armors -&gt; power armor skin) (Hunt 10 SantaClaws -&gt; Christmas themed content during christmas event). That is the problem I have. 
---
You're collecting nuke plants and refining them? Thats where I get almost all mine. Potentially a prime fissure nuke can get you 1-200 violet flux if you're fully perked (green fingers etc).
---
Sounds good.   Also, I think that no-one should be able to murder someone who's selected Pacifist Mode, unless you return the attack. If you return the attack then it should be standard PvP rules, otherwise the person who attacks the Pacifist should get an instant bounty applied to them as they are a criminal in the Wasteland. Maybe a little 'Peace' Sign near your name so they know not to attack you. This would be cool, I think and enable us Pacifists to recognise each other's awesomeness. 
---
Stick on the ol pharma farma and scrounger cards and it's like one of those gameshows where you have 10 min to grab whatever you can in the grocery store.
---
Great. Now I can’t stop singing that (luckily for everyone else, only in my head) Thanks 😂😭
---
Why the carry so much junk ? Kind of your own fault imo
---
How do you manage junk alts if you play solo?
---
This game, community, and dev team is boring &amp; trash anyways
---
Wtfff, they nerfed tf out if fusion cores. They lasted way fuckin longer w/o the perk card.
---
U fukin bugthesda bot
---
Absolutely they should. 
---
Don't do that. 
---
My thought exactly 
---
Look it up on the map. 
---
I simply cannot understand ppl that defend the atom shop. The game throws you a ton at the start but later on challenges are all used up and you might’ve blew through that initial surplus. The rest can be either bugged by not giving the atomic points or not worth the grinding. 
---
Today I was building my base and was looking to buy the AstroTurf. I had almost zero points and needed 600. I had to legitimately weigh the option of grinding for a handful of hours for it or dropping $5 on it. It becomes a question of how much your time is worth. I resent companies that force you into this situation. They make the grind so slow or the price so high that you consider just spending the cash.
---
When creation club released people were not impressed with it because modders had been providing us with some pretty awesome shit for free for awhile.Items that were in that shop for 300 points have popped up in the atomic shop for 800. There’s also items that you can find in game that resemble item shop items. As well as emotes and other stuff that is unclear to the buyers until they get it and realize it was a waste
---
There’s plenty wrong with the shop. Check some youtubers videos on the what becomes a slow trickle of atoms. It’s been a complaint for awhile and not one of those complaints that are high maintenance, but rather a justified one. 
---
It wouldn't get janky. It would just be "over encumbered" and unable to take new items. I've had something like that happen from my crops doing something weird. It didn't cause any issues. 
---
You can get a bounty from not defending a workshop?  I always just leave mine to the wolves after defending it the first time.
---
The Protective and Shielded Casual linings that are on PC came out of the dev room. They can't drop in the game. The quest that is supposed to drop Protective is still bugged, and Shielded won't drop without it. I just verified this by looking at the most recent ESM (patch 5). Nothing has changed.
---
I have 2 accounts. I bought a second one when the game was on sale cheap.  I cant stand the idea of dying and losing my junk so i keep making a new alt when 1 bank is full.
---
Tried but everywhere I looked at was trash so far just seeing if anyone else knows any
---
This is the literal epitome of this sub now.
---
Dude most spotsclose to whitesprings and watoga suck. Morgan town has a small farm area just outside of it on the south east side it's git a house with cat heads on the wall. That's a huge plot of building potential and low level enemies in the area. 
---
Thanks mate I’ll check it out 
---
Yeah for sure. It's alsoclose to the road that grahm travels 
---
Been there for the enclave before BOS and everything worked fine, didn't have to do it again. 
---
Great
---
Yeah, there was a couple times where I noticed I was suddenly outclassed by mobs.  Have to level up guns and armor for a while just doing events and killing guys.
---
What is there not to hate? Cashgrabbing shop for a low quality game.
---
I have a seeping flapper valve on one of the toilets that makes that "scorched officer with silo code" noise... ;-)
---
Edited it to add some of your concerns. its not perfect though.
---
Do legendaries only spawn on nuke drops?
---
Shame it’s nerfed to pipe pistol damage 
---
Casual normies first video game
---
South of the Overseers camp, opposite side of the road, right next to the red truck. Just a few minutes from Morgantown, literally right on Graham’s route, nothing over level 5 ever shows up,  and there’s a cement depot there. If you wanna sacrifice the cement to get water instead, going a bit north will allow you to be between the road and the river like an actual house, and still give enough room for 5-6 industrial purifiers. 
---
Pay no mind to me hiding in the bushes. I’m just glassin for some 3-stars.
---
Sad thing is that Fatman is a quest reward too
---
lol
---
Nah Multiplayer is fine. Pvp just sucks
---
I have a suggestion on your powered door- keypad access when putting it into camp there is only one way in and no way out can you add another keypad on the other side of the door so we can get out? 
---
I like how easily I can kill enemies without a weapon 
---
Nobody’s buying this bs, same as the shop.
---
I dont even care about the shop. Why not just ignore it
---
I had a bunch of mini freezes tonight on ps4 "controls temporaily disabled" message over and over until finally i just left the server. Was fine after i hopped but still inconvenient.
---
You talk like Trump
---
This makes no sense to me. Why don't you just collect the junk if you die? And why are you hording junk. I always spend my junk unlocking new mods for all weapons and armor. And if you have unlocked all mods why do you need so much junk?
---
Shows how Quickthis game is dying, Sad... 
---
Bro thanks for that definitely am gonna check that out 
---
All the recipes are in the science wing once you're over lvl 40
---
oh so you dual box / dual pc?
---
I want a method to swap between alts but can't do that. Was thinking about leaving stuff in a bin when in a group then leaving and coming back but feels like it could so easily go wrong..
---
Creating my CAMP is really all I have left to do in the game and since a lot of cool stuff from fo4 (dlc) is missing, my house feels empty and incomplete, reminiscent of the game itself.
---
I got this and had to disable all other quests related to rose (or that have markers at top of the world), and then go back up to elevator to reload rose. 
---
also, any time you get a glitch in fo76 it is probably a good idea to give your system a cold reboot (power down for a min or two)
---
Ah ok. Thats A shame
---
I've been server hopping EMS for the last two days and havent had a legendary spawn for some reason
---
Are you on console? Also is this your first character?
---
I encountered this for the first time today. It turned out to be an unstable mem OC in my case. Dialing back my mem settings resolved it. (PC)
---
Also, anytime you encounter a glitch in fo76 is it probably a good idea to give your system a cold reboot (power down for a min or two).
---
Another suggestion: If you wanna make $ sell private servers for this game just like Ark does 
---
we already have less durability, add more? no thankyou. can't even do a full circle at whitespring or wogata without it breaking.
---
Ps4. Yeah I always try to play 1 build
---
I have a better solution actually...
---
How about we simply
---
**GET RID OF THE WEIGHT SYSTEM**
---
Because let's be honest here, who ever said in their life "Damn! I sure do love being overburdened and having to always go back to my camp to empty my inventory!"
---
I get that error constantly on PS4 and just keep clicking a million times until it finally logs me in. It does often seem to coincide with switching PS4 profiles. I definitely haven't been duping or anything else and have no issues once I get on a server.
---
I don't believe thats a possible roll. TSE means two shot explosive. Instigating and two shot are both primary attributes. Maybe you mean instigating explosive.
---
No problem mate. Should’ve said it in the original post, but the spot I’m talking about for the water (at least where I have my camp) is right next to a small car that crashed into a rock and ejected someone though the windshield. 
---
What system are you on? I had many crashes a while back that turned out to be an unstable ram OC (PC). If on PC try using default ram settings and see if the problem persists.
---
Also, it is probably a good idea to do a cold reboot (power down for a few min and reboot) to improve system stability.
---
Alright, I'm on PS4 too and had big crashes problems after the first patch (been playing since launch). I ended up contacting Bethesda and got a fix that still seems to be working. 
---
1: Delete game data from the PS4. This does not delete character data as it is stored online in their servers. You will lose pictures you have taken in photo mode and settings but that's it. 
---
2: Delete game from system. 
---
3: Clear system cache, if you dont know the only way to do this is to power down the system completely and once the lights go out unplug the system for about 30 seconds.
---
4: Re-build database. When you plug the system back in press and hold the power button for about 15 seconds and you will hear a second beep. Use a connected controller and select option 5 (I believe been a few days since I've done it) which is rebuild database. System will do the rest and restart. 
---
5: Re-download/install the game again. 
---
It's a huge pain but it seems like every once in a while a bad file gets snuck in there and causes crashing issues. Unfortunately for us on consoles we dont have an easier way to resolve this so this is the only real sure way to get it. I know it's scary to delete the data but I did it and did not lose my level 120 (at the time) or my alt. Good luck!
---
Having Whitesprings to yourself without five Excavator Sledge goons getting in the way is great
---
Yeah, I’ve got quite a few of the challenges  not working. The discover locations have bugged out for me. Some after patches just started working again others still not 
---
This is awesome. Thanks so much!
---
Except Souls actually has good pvp design... or any pvp design for that matter. You invade with the goal of killing the host, and if you want to dick around in the process more power to ya. F76 pvp is, for the most part, just a bunch of pointless dickery. Comparing them is... laughable. 
---
[Meanwhile in Fallout 2...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sewQ2raTJvY)
---
There’s really nothing to indicate that. To make the first multiplayer fallout iteration and ignore PvP would be a mistake 
---
I feel it's future content, something about the voting systems around the world and such
---
If I see a wanted with less than 50 I will help em out. Not take junk. Guard it till they respawn. But not if they in pa   shits to expensive to fix and I don't Wana don't unnecessary damages. Exit armor and I help you out. But if it is higher than that I figure you been a prick and I'ma Rob you blind.
---
Lucky hole and excavator. One run will take 20 minutes and get you over 400 lead.

---
I'm not saying get rid of it at all, I'm saying \*add\* and addition more roleplay-ey way to do it \*as well\*. I agree with you, it's ridiculously better than some mmos out there. GW2 from my experience.
---
I found an instigating one. Which now I think has more power than the old TSE The Dragon.
---
Are you using it with a custom cfg? (Fallout76Custom) ?
---
Or an old Fallout76Prefs?
---
You can find these on documents, try deleting the files and restart the game.
---
I fix a lot of issue deleting mine.
---
No point in bulking them. Waste of plastic even if you could.
---
You can always pick perk cards for any special regardless if it's maxed or not 
---
It tells you right on screen to go left and right to swap the different cards per special 
---
Didn’t even know that hazmats were part of the game, so thank you for this! Hopefully I’ll be able to get my own now
---
Yeah I have a couple of location challenges that are broken. I have the locations on the map and have been to them numerous times, but the challenged won't complete, it's very frustrating.
---
Where? Where have i said that everyone hates the game? Point out to me where i said those specific words. 
---
Because you on the otherhand have made the assumption that literally everyone loves GTA online, which is again, a huge fucking grind fest filled with degenerates on fucking motorcycles that fucking fly and shoot rockets and destroy your cargo. 
---
Even people on RDO are saying that RDO sucks and that there's no content and other shit. I know that because I actually read up on the shit i talk about and i actually play both games pretty much every day or every other day. 
---
Love it when that happens... Get to hit up all the best places to farm mats and kill monsters.  Game also runs noticeably smoother too.
---
It’s VERY grindy. Especially when you get something stupid like the perk “Woodchuck” or a repeat of something YOU ALREADY HAVE. For example, you can have Cannibal 3, get Cannibal from a card pack and now you have a choice between Cannibal 3 and regular Cannibal. It’s very frustrating.
---
In the twenties you are better off being stealthy and smart and getting xp from quest progression
---
I seriously never understand these posts about the shop lol first it's optional and second it's stupid easy to make atom in this game hell you barely have to do anything to complete the dailies 
---
I still have around 1340 atom and I got everything I've wanted from the shop for guess what .. free lol 
---
Thanks dude, me and my wooden eye --- I'm just not compatible with the games UI :-)
---
I love the lore of ALL the Fallout games! 
---
All good man, this was a big issue people had at launch so it only makes sense new people would also run into that problem 
---
Happy to help 
---
You know what my secret is? I'm not interested in 90% of the stuff on the shop. No one *needs* anything from the shop. 
---
Yeah, if you actually want more than just a few things you should be prepared to spend money. Or have patience grinding your ~50 Atoms a day, ~200 Atoms a week from challenges, but I assure you stuff will be added faster than you can grind the Atoms to obtain them. It's still a mtx store, after all. 
---
Sometimes I regret killing all the Brahmin when I pass through when there are new toons wandering toward flatwoods. Need my ribeye steaks!
---
It would be appreciated. I fully re-listened to so many Overseer logs and such cuz there's no read/unread thingy and I was trying to figure out why the follow the Overseer's journey wasn't finishing. Too bad nothing ever works to complete it anyways though. 😔(all challenges done for it)
---
is there anything that Bethesda didn't mess up ?
---
thanks for the info :  )
---
Authentication server problem. Lots of people affected.
---
While I server hopped to get the coat I not Grahm a few times too. I am pretty sure they share their cap limit :(.
---
Cheers, I do like to do a little bit of farming there, hopefully one day that pesky Wendigo will yield what I want, (Even killed it in a clown outfit, but didn't get the reward, but that is another can of worms)
---
Passive mode bruh. Spray and pray. 
---
37 days played when the game has only been out for 95. Holy Moly.
---
I honestly keep hoping I would be alone for even an hour, but everytime I am on it is pretty full. I try different times also.
---
Had to do this myself on ps4, the mans right.
---
[&gt;tfw you're holed up next to 3 lead nodes and you can just keep leaving the server and coming back to get said lead nodes.](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1ac645833fe8c2251fb3bbda8385b07/tumblr_inline_o1c979Az1C1tfhyu9_500.gif) 
---
Thanks buddy! I actually made a big write up on this when all of it was going on. Been a while back though. Had the same issue with FO4 and used same fix. 
---
Hey man it’s solid advice and well written. Wish more were this helpful. 
---
I think they're too unwilling to spend money, even if it's cheap. lol
---
I liked raider radio too. I really enjoyed hearing stories of the wasteland. I wish radio freedom had been like that instead of a 2 song loop interrupted by a guy saying 'nothing to report'.
---
West Tek refreshes pretty much every 15m-20m, been farming it since the get go. By the time I clear another area I’ll hit up a quick event and just head right back to west tek. Amazing exp too.
---
Part of that is just smart leveraging of the current game mechanics, but I’d agree that it’s poor design. At the same time, even if redesigned people would still do this. They’d just create lower level PvP players and target higher level players. I created a new character to PvP with less loss. I’m not sure there’s much you can do design wise to prevent assholes from being assholes 
---
It was probably Todd Howard waiting to abduct you
---
Interesting. I've heard that legendary pools get "seeded" differently depending on the server - as in only a certain portion of legendary effects have a chance to drop, and the pool is different each time you server hop. 
---
Does the data you collected suggest anything about this, one way or the other?
---
The shop is awesome. As long as we can get atoms from doing challenges.
---
This is the wackiest version of this game EVER!!!!!!! Shit sucks ass!!!! 
---
Awesome read. Hope you recover soon. I’ve broken my scapula and I know how much it hurts. Glad you can get some enjoyment. 
---
At least on the various ghouls/scorched in whitesprings. And the local accommodation. Or a mission. I've not encountered any so far alas.  
---
If you only need one star to make the gun, it’s easier to farm yourself. I’d go that route 
---
The discord that I’m part of has held a game world for over a day and it is still going. About 30 hours now. We have taken it in turns to stay online and keep things going.
---
The only way into it seems to be if you are friends of someone who is inside.
---
In the entire time we didn’t have one person randomly spawn in. Was nice for once to not have to worry about griefing and PvP.
---
We did the queen three times, got the best legendary drops we have seen in months and took over half of the workshops.
---
Anymore than say six and you end up spending all your time doing defend missions which isn’t as much fun and farming for legendaries.
---
I highly recommend trying to find a server with a very small population!
---
The locked room at the bus station in witoga has a power suit and a core 😁
---
How many other ppl were trying to hit her? The more players in area the more hp she gets. Also my bloody multipurpose axe was doin +1400. There was 3 of use with explosives. My prime AAE 50cal was pumping out 250 dmg as well. Bitch melted like butter in the microwave😂
---
Mostly so I dont have to farm anymore of it. I've got so much stockpiled I can be picky with what im looting, letting me opt out of weight reduction mechanics.
---
I think it would be kinda cool if it happened for like an hour. You are right, I can go for awhile without running into another player. 
---
Amen to that. My high Level friends were dragging me to WS when I was Level 20 and I wasn't having fun, even with tagging and crazy XP. I didn't go back there until Level 50 when I could 1-shot anything there with 2.5xStealth Bonus for my Sniper Build.    
---
Sucks having to stay in the green zone for the early game but once you break through that threshold, the game really opens up
---
Honestly, even on a full server it is like I am alone, most of the time.
---
just FYI, Xbox has a built in lfg function.
---
guide &gt; party &gt; find group
---
And then put you on the cart with a rebel, rebel leader and a horse thief
---
I figured out about a month ago that I could just buy a 2nd account when it was cheap. If im moving stuff between accounts i always drop my graphics settings to lowest. Even on medium to low settings with 2 clients open it kills my PC.
---
I usually just put stuff in a container and grab it all with the alt. I make sure im crouched so people dont see me on the map. I've had people try to mess with me while moving stuff.
---
the fact that you failed to understand sarcasm seriously make me question your intelligence
---
Well, a free copy for buying a console..... Or used controller
---
I bought a second account a while back when they where on sale. I put my graphics settings to lowest and open the game from the .exe and trade between accounts. 
---
Having slowly screenshot that whole post I scrolled down to your comment.
---
WTF you can save posts? It’s taken me nearly a year and god knows how many photos and you just causally opened my eyes. 
---
You sir, are the true hero.
---
Is it possible you're just missing it? I have LOTD and LB Rank 3 and mine activate quite regularly but in the heat of battle it can be easily miss.    
---
Want it to activate? Go stand in front of a Minigun Turret, gets me every time /s (don't do that if you value your life)
---
Pretty salty 
---
I wish they’d take some stuff from ESO to implement, group world bosses (not roving scorchbeasts) and dolmen (not strictly group, but spawnable grind spots).  Me and my brother are bored of Grafton Day
---
The difference is: Bethesda has access to all those books and research, but *we* don't have access to their data. 
---
Since I assume they like money as much as the next guy, I assume they're keeping an eye on this data and course-correcting as necessary, rather than going by "redditors want cheaper stuff, let's make stuff cheaper".
---
Using free Atoms is fine.  Having shitty products to buy and stupid prices requiring micro-transactions?  Someone needs gutted and hung on a pike
---
This. You’d be surprised how far a silencer and a little boost to the sneak skill goes. Also, armor with chameleon will keep you invisible as long as you’re crouched and not moving. 
---
YES! It doesn’t make sense as to way you can’t rank them up. They are literally the same thing. It’s so annoyed. 
---
Your think, but the rad resist counts against beserkers. I’m not sure how you’re supposed to make a beserker build work yet
---
67% of the data is from the same server I was lucky enough yesterday to be completely alone in the last 8-10 hours. I haven't recorded which lines were on the same server before (had a couple of crashes/disconnects then).
---
I got that 90 items dropped over a course of 14-16 hours, which is exceptionally long time, even as staying the same server. Most servers don't last more than 4-6 hours (either kicked out, CTD'd or just getting tired).
---
I'd have to play more to add that to the analysis process. Note, however, that getting 20-40 legendaries per server is far too low given the sheer size of the loot pool/effect pool. One of the problems is that triggering a legendary spawn, even in Whitesprings, is a hit-or-miss, especially when playing alone so there is no other player to keep it triggering. Also there is no way to know one gets back to the very same server instance some time in the future.
---
Music rights are expensive. And since game sales were less than hoped for, I doubt they'd shell out money for rights to several songs.
---
I got two ultracite ammo plan drops during Scorched Earth last night, .38 &amp; .308.
---
I don't have any prime receivers yet, how do I get those?
---
*Johnny Guitar intensifies*
---
I have a different view. They could be relevant again if the game weren't constantly fucking booting you off the server. 
---
Yeah yeah it's an online game and it happens.  But- and I'm being dead serious here- the likelihood actually seems to go up when you take over a power plant and also take over the workshop that the power plant provides power for. 
---
This has actually happened to me every single time I've taken over a power plant and the workshop if fuels. 
---
I powered up Poseidon, then took over Grafton steel. With Poseidon running,  there's no need to build generators, The steel factory already has 100 power. So my buddy and I took them, had them up and running and then... CRASH!!! 
---
The exact same thing happened last week with the red rocket station and the plant that powers it. 
---
The power plants make fusion cores but they also power up other workshops.... except when the game crashes, which has been damn near every fucking time I have done it
---
You didn't check the bodies by Vault 76 then. there is a pipe pistol to the right and a machete to the left down the stairs.
---
I usually go there to unload my materials, aid, ect.
---
Thanks for sharing all of that, it'll come in handy! 😀
---
I think armor paint is the only thing that truly needs tuning. They are so restrictive yet has the highest prices in the shop. Like, I have to not have an outfit equipped AND I can only use it on like leather or combat individually. 
---
I can buy a camp-item or outfit for 800 atoms and I'll know I'll be able to use it freely, that's fine since I'm basically 100% guaranteed to use it, a lot of them aren't even 800 atoms. But armor paint cost 800 for leather and another 800 for combat, it's a horrible deal. I don't get to decide what armor my legendary effects will get stuck on.
---
Never happened to me but as I play 100% solo I would love this
---
You're always going to be able to keep roughly the same amount of stuff in your stash; Betheada would balance stash size and item weights assuming the player is using every weight reduction perk.
---
Not entirely true. I'm mostly solo so if I can't find a radsponge Team I have to Hazmat up and go in with Sniper Rifle and pray I don't draw attention
---
I only had 2 queen runs and I generally don't track plan drops as her loot table seems to be  [bugged](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=sbq%20vents&amp;restrict_sr=1) anyway. 
---
&gt;prime receivers 
---
Firebreather's training?
---
Same here. I have to say, the client stability situation on PS4 is a bit disgraceful. But at least it's no longer crashing the console so hard you need to physically unplug it because not even the reset button works; that's some progress :)
---
I knew about the dupes, but felt the version i was purchasing wasn’t a duped version - ended up not being a duped version i still have said shotgun, sorry for the late reply, no notifications on mobile
---
Tab) Give Up
---
Annoying as he is, Garvey is still less annoying than the fucking cliff racers...
---
They really phoned it in on f4 radio and I’m happy they added some genuinely good tracks to 76, but now more than ever with no npcs a lovable radio host would be great company. 
---
Yeah thats my next aim, get armour piece with chameleon.
---
On a dollar per hour entertainment basis, Bethesda could ship five empty boxes in a row, I could buy them at full retail price, and still be comfortably ahead. 
---
https://youtu.be/FkK4KEob-yU on ps4 so i cant help but watch this for tips
---
Simple answer- which few people here are willing to admit: lower levels in this game are pure agony.  My first play through was torturous grinding until about level 40, when things seemed to get more manageable.  I started a second character once my first was past level 100 and I had forgotten how torturous the early game grind is. 
---
It does get better as you level up.   You shouldn't have to wait until level 50 to enjoy the game but honestly, that is how they designed it.
---
Yeah same, im 95% certain ive been to every marked location on the map now, but i have loads of things like "discover spruce knob" when ive been there loads of times and claimed the workshop there a few times but they dont complete
---
After looking at these % drop rates.... Just wondering who wants to use weapon with +30% to animal / robot / mirelurk or bugs / super mutants / ghouls / scorchbeast, and junkie? It's the worst legendary affixes. These should have reduced chances the more stars in the weapon. Or even better just remove them all. I'm sure majority of us would just sell these legendary affixes or drop em in the trash can.
---
Might wanna start to get creative, Bethesda!!! and add more interesting legendary affixes. Like :
---
1. Add burning damage OR POISON damage (Dot)
---
2. Add cold / slow damage (just like Cyrolator effect)
---
3. Add ricochet effect (just like Tesla rifle; hit the nearby target)
---
4. Add radiation damage (just like Radium rifle)
---
5. Add disease effect (maybe increase damage taken by x % for x seconds, just like Tenderizer or Anti-Suppressor effect, or negate random SPECIAL / mutation)
---
And oh, Legendary wood armor needs to go too. Nobody wants to wear it.
---
I've been on late at night. and not a soul around. Feels kinda weird.
---
Hey again Wully, just got round to running this script. Ran into some issues.
---
So I dragged serialize-command-json.pas onto FO76Edit64.exe and selected SeventySix.esm. Then of course the script runs. This took *13 hours* and at the end was consuming *10GB* of memory. Then it got to the end, tried to write the output file and threw an access violation exception and wrote an empty file ;_;
---
Any advice would be great?
---
Funnily enough mine is worse now than it was before. I get a lot of infinite loading screens now. I’m on Xbox 
---
That's how I feel about every heavy weapon. Hopefully that 800 sb increase will come soon..But who knows what Bethesdas up to, just had a friends get an unauthorized login. Hes got 1 character, is under weight and has only logged on recently(due to work/adultlife) to collect things I've got him off reddit and hop off lol 
---
&gt;This has probably already been suggested. Shoot you don't know until you though it out there.
---
I don't mind this suggestion, but there is a search function, you know. It is on every subreddit on the right bar on the very top and allows for detailed searches. Like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=vault+76+hub&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;sort=relevance
---
So if you would put in the effort you actually could know before posting. As I said, I don't mind the suggestion. And every redditor sympathizes with you if you owuld say 'heck, Im too lazy to search", because we're all too lazy for anything here on reddit.
---
More fool you for walking around with that amount of crap on you and getting a bounty
---
Once pvp servers will be online they should made all others strictly non pvp. That would solve a lot of problems.
---
Only lvl 217+ mages can dude. But you have to rescue dumbledor from the eternity stone held by darkseid first
---
That fucking song
---
Happened to me on my main account 10 minutes ago. Second account working fine currently. 700+ hours on my main account with around 25k points or more invested in the Atom Shop. Hoping this gets solved sooner than later for the lot of us. 
---
Lol i wiped put someones entire caps as they did exactly this for about 15 min. He kept on coming back and attacking muh camp therefore getting a wanted status. What an idiot right? Wtf is wrong with these people 😂😂😂 and the vitriolic messages followed
---
I have only wanted 3 times .1st was when I accidentally damaged a generator at a workshop trying to kill enemies helping defend the workshop. 2nd time was when they put out the patch that locked supply drops. I picked a lock not knowing this, and my 3rd one I got yesterday after going to get my supply drop I was shooting some Super Mutants and hit the cargobot, which turned hostile and I didn't know it would change the supply drop too, Once I picked the lock I was wanted. I am pretty sure it was mine since I put the holo tape in and got the message to retrieve the supply crate. I was the only one in the area also. It just takes forever for someone to kill me
---
For me, it's lack of things to buy, all the neat camp decorations just don't excite me.
---
When you online? 
---
I'm interested
---
Uncommon yes, super rare no . I have found 1 and was given 1 by a stranger who liked my c.a.m.p. (maybe they can drop from workshop events too?)
---
For comparison, I have not seen signs and letters outside of vendors.
---
I’m online now. Just had someone message me to say they would help in around an hour and a half/2 hours when they get off work.
---
Appreciate the guide. While I'm level 41 and still doing main/side missions (and exploring), I'm currently looking for places to farm better gear as I get closer to 50. I always go at it solo, since none of my friends on Xbox picked up the game besides me, so this really helps.
---
Awesome
---
Sure I'll let you know. My GT - the Welsh Gaz
---
Message me if I'm online and I'll join you 
---
I don't know if that would be actually so simple from a programming point of view. Everything you put in your CAMP is an object that can be created, manipulated and scrapped (i.e. destroyed). It can also be damaged by NPC enemies. The engine would have to decide if the damage to the CAMP object originates from a player who owns the CAMP and wants to scrap something, from a player who don't owns the CAMP or from an enemy like a rad rat or a scorchbitch. I beleive that would require a new class of object.
---
Additionally, every object that is involved would have to make this decision with every bullet or ski sword swing to determine if the damage gets registered or not. Since the damage nees to always gets registered on the server and not your local client you wou &lt;Server not responding&gt;d meant a whole n&lt;Server not responding&gt;ew level of &lt;Server not responding&gt; stress t&lt;Server not responding&gt;he connection.
---
I was playing Friday around 7 pm and I wasn’t alone but there were only 5 people on it versus the usual 16-18 
---
The versus prefixes make no balance sense to me either: 
---
* They have a 1:7 chance of dropping in general.
---
* You have a limited inventory/stash and you wouldn't carry 7 weapons with versus prefix at once. 
---
* Also many locations can spawn a multitude of enemies so you may have brought the wrong prefixes to the battle.
---
* There is already a low chance getting weapons with the desired name (handmade, super sledge, etc.) and possibly have ranged/melee at once too.
---
* Given that reduced weight requires 3\* and generally there is a very miniscule chance you get the right weapon with the desired effects. 
---
A straightforward rebalance would be to give these +100% damage boost against the target type, especially now that TS is only +25%.
---
&gt; Legendary wood armor needs to go too 
---
Let it drop only in The Forrest and only from legendary enemies below 20.
---
Ooh, I'll look into that, thanks! 😃
---
Go play Fallout 4. 
---
What does the extra agility do on the armour? How fast does your stamina recover?
---
The game is dying and no wonder why
---
It really tells how much Bethesda fucked up that you get exited when the mmo aspect of the game breaks and the game becomes only a co-op game.
---
Is it still considered pay to win when your odds of finding a specific legendary are a million to one, or if you play this more or less entirely as a single player game? 
---
In my early days I would've been more than happy to spend my free atoms on legendary items. I've since acquired decent weapons and don't really need much at the moment, but my view hasn't really changed. 
---
I honestly can't see myself ever running out of Atoms at this point. I'm waiting for weapon skins mainly. I refuse to spend a single atom on decorations for my camp until the more important purchases have been made. 
---
Happened on my main account about 20 minutes ago. Second account no issues. I noticed this has been getting reported occasionally since beta and the only recommendations are wipe .ini and repair is just uninstall and reinstall. 
---
Anyone received any official notice from Bethesda who also got this 4:8:2000 issue?
---
I lean towards suspecting that legendaries are seeded RNG. I launched my 2nd solo nuke last night, most of the time equipping my trusty vampire boxing glove, then completed scorched earth using a bloodied Gatling gun +fire rate (quickly finishing her with a bloodied grog axe). My loot from the SBQ: vampire Gatling gun +fire rate. 
---
My previous 2 SBQ loot drops also seemed to be related to the weapon that I had been equipping/using the most: bloodied swing speed melee. 
---
Personally, I do not believe that SBQ loot is bugged as it has not been my experience. I do get the frustration with not getting a timely or good drop, but it seems to be some combination of whoever deals the most damage and gets her to agro on them the 'most' will get the loot drop with some time delay to claim before anyone else does. 
---
Anecdotal, but definitely a trend. 
---
Thank you for posting this! I just upgraded mine to 3 yesterday (yeah, apparently it's *STILL* a bug!) and noticed my 30 or so cores were like 90lbs, instead of like 9ish. I'll try your advice when I get on again.
---
I just screenshot it too lol
---
If you were trying to export the entire game no wonder it took so long.
---
I've pushed some updates: https://github.com/Wully616/xEdit-json-export
---
The access violation exception may be a permission error, or a disk space issue given the amount of data it would be exporting.
---
Could you try the new version and just try to export either a single entry under something like Ammunition to ensure it is able to write out the file. 
---
For example Exporting the POST_AmmoCompoundBow under Ammunition it should produce a Output.json file with the contents:
---

So many of the offerings available are just awful. I'm particularly disappointed with the flash sales. To my knowledge I have only bought two limited time items:
---
- Hot Rodder PA Paints
---
- No One Facepaint 
---
Particularly with all the negative press and lack of end game content, I personally feel that the Atom store should be releasing their better options sooner rather than later. 
---
I login every day to check the Atom store, but when there is a timed sale it's usually some nonsense - prewar fishing/ lumberjack outfits as examples. I'm sitting at over 3500 Atoms and the daily challenges are becoming less and less appealing. I have excess currency and there's nothing I want to spend it on. I'm running out of reasons to login, sadly.
---
I use *Vampiric Gatling Gun/Handmade* and I never had another drop of them, even before this loot log. Nor did I ever encounter a 2-3\* *Super Sledge* with +40% swing speed ever again.
---
However, I did have cases where I got a *Regenerating* armor part with one more star than I had equipped, but different material I didn't want. Also I was stashing a quad combat shotgun and quad lever rifle, I sold them eventually to save space. Within the same server, a couple of hours later, I looted a *Quad Combat Shotgun* and a *Quad Lever Rifle* again.
---
you're not wearing power armor are you?
---
It’s been doing this to a lot of people since Friday night I was in my own server all day sat and today I got this message so your not alone
---
The only versus prefix weapons I keep are Troubleshooter's because I'm going for the robot related combat challenges, and they have those absurd kill count requirements. I'll gladly drop them whenever I find an adaequate weapon with a usable general modifier, though.
---
Zealot's can make some sense, too, as it also counts against SBs, but not with the stash size as it is now.
---
Berserker's? I will keep and equip that one Berserker's Explosive Combat Shotgun I own whenever I'm crafting, but as a playstyle it's too risky IMO. Junkie's, is there anybody out there who uses those? 
---
No one will receive a message from Bethesda there closed weekends
---
I tend to be wanted a lot more often these days due to boredom, and seeing a CAMP with a bunch of turrets directly behind the golf club at Whitesprings. I always tell my teammates "guys, get ready to kill me" and they all come over. Yesterday a level 23 (I'm 159) killed me before my teammates could and...I didn't get mad. I was wanted, I knew what I was doing, and hey! A low level just got 250 caps from killing me. Don't turn into a little bitch baby when you're wanted and someone claims your bounty
---
I fell in one by accident and died, couldn’t re-spawn anywhere and obviously couldn’t retrieve loot, def wouldn’t  recommend lol
---
Help a Reddit newbie out, how do you save it?
---
Did you read my post?
---
Interesting. Also you do not mention non-legendary drops (which happens more often at higher levels) or legendary drops from non-legendary enemies (which I have experienced in many occasions, but who knows, my system could have been buggy/unstable at the time)
---
It almost seems like we are still playing the same last few games with minor modifications. To me, it is still Fallout 4, but it actually seems like a lesser version. This could be the original Fallout 4 that was abandoned when the multiplayer aspect was going well. In an attempt to recoup some of the lost money spent on the abandoned game they simply added some content and released it as is. 
---
Thanks for post OP, upvoted it. But... 900 hours?! Mother of god, it mean around 7-10 hours per day every day?!
---
So just trying to be a karma seeker at this point?
---
BOS plans work for all weights, i got mine from grafton station (pre the plan update)
---
I checked out Camp McClintock and didn't find many battered clipboards.
---
Where do you find them there?
---
This happens a lot of you play late into the night and people start to leave but few people join the currently running servers so the population gets thinned out across loads more servers than normal for such little amount of players.
---
What does the missile silo holotape do?
---
So you are saying you played the games how it should be played and enjoyed it? 
---
You hear that Bethesda? 
---
2k hours of fo4 for me, I couldn't even stand 10 hours of fo76. :( I hope the next installment isn't garbage. 
---
This happens alot I enjoy it better I'm part of a big community called RaptureGaming and we'd much prefer a private server so we can have everyone ok one server without having to leave and join till were all in the same one and to also have free rain and no worries about PvP 
---
I finished everything and just have to go back and talk with her, when I do all she will say is "ah you're back" and nothing else....can't complete quest line....
---
That would be way too many items, and I scrap them anyway.
---
I think the non-legendary enemy dropping legendary is a workaround/mitigation for the case when a legendary doesn't drop an item. My assumption is the server detects the client reported it failed to locate the corpse the server wants to add a legendary, therefore, the server adds the legendary to the next enemy, which is usually non-legendary. I did not track those separately, but marked a few with remarks of this case.
---
woud love if u can add me too ign Jankjank
---
For sure, I meant to say non-legendary from legendary enemy. I have suspected something similar.
---
BTW: I have a vampiric Gatling +fr that you are welcome to have in appreciation for your post, if you like
---
It’s not for me tbh, il be sticking with FO76 but The Outer Worlds looks interesting for the autumn maybe. If I get bored at any point I might cash in my 1 month free game pass trial and play We Happy Few as that looks like it might be amusing even if it’s an old game. Never played a Far Cry game but Far Cry New Dawn looks colourful and is post-apocalyptic so that might be an option but I’m just really happy with FO76 atm and in no hurry to buy anything else
---
Are you on Xbox? Can craft some level 10 gear for you
---
I haven't spent a single dollar in the atom shop as absolutely nothing there has had any aesthetic appeal to me (so far). 
---
This game is intended to be played with friends. I have more playing on console than I do on PC. So I went the console route. I don't regret it. I wish we could have cross platform games though that would be awesome. 
---
And springs. Even with McClintock and Sugar Grow
---
Same with various lookout towers as well 
---
I'd love the camo paint for my combat armour, but you won't see it due to my tattered dress!  
---
Looking cool is great but +1 perception is +1 perception....
---
Someone tried to sell me .45 Ultracite at 5000 caps a bullet once. I knew what he was trying to do, and told him so. He acknowledged it, set up a new trade for... 5000 a bullet. I did eventually get a real deal, but damn. Also literally had to spell out that I only had 1500 caps and therefore could not pay 3000 for a TSE combat shotgun, even had I wanted it. Same guy...
---
Bethesda says your welcome 
---
Before you quit?
---
Same issue here on ps4
---
Not everyone who get wanted wants wanted, and some of them are getting wanted to due you a service.  
---
Reactive plating is an accidental way - Certain players will discover that even as a pacifist, wearing reactive plating will murder other players who attack them and give them a 25 cap bounty.  
---
Turrets behind the whitespring golf club - Have to be destroyed every time, its what atom would want
---
That would ruin raiders gameplay
---
I remember being level 8. Me and anothet level 8 teamed up and kept killing a level ~28 and a level 30 that teamed up against us after an event. We won that whole thing and sure was fun
---
Thanks. My dream is a Vampiric, +10% damage when aiming and either weight reduced or +50 DR while aiming, which is really rare drop.
---
Banned 2 time wow u sounds like a legit player
---
1.5k-2k
---
I would pay around 2-3k
---
you want to buy it?
---
I usually agree crossplay should be used when possible but... Without mods on console that'll make some tough choices for private server...
---
 Play on servers with different rules and new assets that vanilla doesn't have fighting off 30 waves of scorched equipped with flamers mini nukes gamma guns riding bears with a 4 man camp built together with 90% reduced budget for generators and turrets and pets in a base assault event generated by the modded server on your camp that you build on the rooftops of watoga where the floor is literally lava as the streets below are a giant fissure retextued to be fire and the buildings themselves have populated insides that you can explore
---
Or play with more people in a watered down console friendly modded server
---
doesnt matter i sold it for 1300 just now lol
---
Thank you! Whenever I searched I got lists of where to get them but not their effects. 
---
I would like to see them spending money in other places and not liscencing more music. I love the curated list they bring to the games, and from a music snobs perspective its impressive the lenghts they go to to get specific hard to find versions also. With that said i only listen to the radio for the first 100 hrs then i take matters into my own hands. go into settings of game-audio-turn game music all way down. you can use a variety of apps for music now. i use (xbox) spotify and mixcloud most. I keep my music app vol at 5-10% mixes great with game, still hear footsteps, ect. Soundtracks on spotify are great! obviously try blade runner soundtrack first. I also play alot of outrun/synthwave. really gives me an 80’s b movie vibe. you can even find a spotify playlist someone made with every song from every fallout game. so there is that too.
---
Ya I’ll buy it, 2.5k sound good? Could also trade you some stuff if there’s anything you need
---
On Xbox, you can use RB to expand some emotes.
---
No worries. I keep referring back too lol
---
It should say 'expand' somewhere on the wheel when you hover over a specific emote, press the button it tells you and there will be a list of emotes under that emote category e.g wave -&gt; salute
---
its lvl 35  and i just sold it...sorry bout that
---
BeximusMaximus
---
XBox One S
---
BUG
---
When in a trading screen, when I'm decreasing the caps in the trade box the number will go to 0, and then go straight up to 25,000 caps and you have to come all the way back down again. This doesn't happen when you increase the amount.
---
FEEDBACK
---
Can you have perk loadouts please? Even just having 1 alternative perk set to swap in and out of would be really helpful. Maybe a shortcut on the favourites wheel could work.
---
Lowest bidder-itist
---
You called?
---
Lame bro, woulda gave you twice the caps 
---
I fell into the one inside the glassed cavern one time. Respawn outside, where there are like 3 or 4 scorch beasts flying around blasting me as I try to get back in. Then as soon as I load into the cave, this huge mob of scorched are just standing there at the entrance, like every scorched in the whole place had respawned, and someone had come in and trained them all to the entrance.
---
Tldr: don't fall in fissures. But if you do, definitely don't fall in the one in the glassed cavern.
---
Conclusion : fallout is not multiplayerr game
---
I don't think so? I'm playing in the UK and I bump into people from Europe almost as much as people from the States. 
---
You can learn all the train stations via these maps.
---
The map in Responders HQ at the airport gives you some key locations as well.
---
The map in the control room of a power plant shows you where the substations are
---
The map in the Enclave Bunker shows you where the silos and prime military installations are
---
And as already mentioned, the lookout towers reveal locations within the immediate area
---
Best thing I’ve seen all day lol. What weapon is that btw?
---
I can put the bone meal in, but on the other console it wont let me place the chemicals I collected, the option doesn't appear.  Tried dropping extras and server hopping but nothing works. 
---
Found mine in a random locked toolbox. 
---
Open everyone you find is the lesson here.
---
On playstation, you hit triangle and it creates a wire than you lead from the source to the thing that needs it. There should be a little prompt somewhere on the screen.
---
I haven't seen a Bloodrage Mirelurk ever before until yesterday. I went to a horde event and there were these black bugs. Kings are really dangerous in numbers, especially when part of the SBQ entourage. If you can get one, have a Vampiric high DPS weapon to help with healing.
---
Late at night states time, or? 
---
I added you as I friend. I’ll message you next time we are both on. I’d love a marsupial serum for sure. I think I need one t-45 and one t-60 piece. I’ll look to see what I need. I’ll bring a couple of my best guns to see if you can mod them for me too. My gt is ReadyForBread 
---
I’m on 76 as well, it is doing the same thing for me. 
---
I now hope to contract Rad Worms at the beginning of my Whitesprings run as it gives +90% damage with fully buffed Adrenaline 5 and +50 carry weight for my Excavator PA!
---
Playing on PC. I am doing this Coming to fruition -quest and I have cleared whole area on Harpers Ferry, and now the final terminal to access Raleigh's pc is missing. Cant access the room without it. Do I really have to boot the game and start all over again Q_Q
---
I'm stealth-unarmed. I can stand directly in front of a Scorchbeast, and it won't see me unless I smack it. Even then, it takes about 3 hits to enter [Danger].
---
Gun Fu works with melee VATS, and since blitz is always on with melee, combining it with Grim Reaper's Sprint lets you carve a beautiful dance of broken bodies without ever being seen. 
---
Magnetic personality perk is great for this. If you have a full team, and everyone has just 3 charisma, one person shares magnetic personality, and the other 3 people can now share level 3 perks.
---
I think that shows how much of an XEdit dummy I am. How can I point XEdit to anything other than the entire game? I'm only seeing the option of SeventySix.esm and don't know how to change that.
---
Once that's worked out, I'll try running your latest version on admin permissions to see if that helps. I wouldn't be surprised if the exception was due to the absurd memory usage (it was a memory read access violation).
---
Also thanks so much for your help, really helpful!
---
I don't see the problem really. I haven't spend any real money in-game either, still got my lumberjack outfit. *shrug* Think the challenges reset daily also, so you can basically farm Atoms if you want to. 
---
PS4 unfortunately. And thank you in advance ! 😁
---
Are you on xbox? If so I would love to buy one from you please. Just spent 5 days server hopping to get all the other plans for the marine armor set. 
---
I know. But no I don't agree. Just because someone on the internet says something mean isn't going to change anything with how a developer responds to fixing their damn game. It's their job and people have paid for this game, and they have a right to be angry. Who is responsible. Probably some upper management for rushing the game out before it was ready and not having a proper beta to fix stuff before release. But the person ranting on the internet isn't going to think things through like that. All they know is they are having these issues with the game that are annoying them, and the developers don't seem to care or communicate. We all say stuff sometimes without thinking. 
---
I do “uncasual” things all the time but am still VERY much a filthy casual haha, I won’t go launch that nuke with you, but I will build you a camp for 3 days straight lulz 
---
I had a server all to me for 10 hours just yesterday. Solo SBQ, Whitesprings, check! Blair Mountain, check!
---
My suspicion is that it wasn't a complete random fallout in my case. I triple nuked Whitesprings before which made all higher level players to hop servers after realizing they can't launch for 3 hours :)
---
Yes they are speaking mandarin. It’s hard to understand but yes they are
---
On the ios app anyway there’s a ribbon looking thing at the top right, just click that.
---
It's at the top where the "you're special!" photo is on this one :) 
---
Also, it's pretty easy to tell if one is on at first glance. Is the top part moving? It's on. There's also a button that says "attach wire". 
---
I literally get them every few days from farming workshops 
---
Are they trying to take over the workshop? 
---
Bullseye. I am pacifist as well and this is exactly what happens.
---
itll tell you how much is left on the cooldown timer for each silo if a nuke has been launched..
---
Do you have a disease/radiation poisoning?
---
&gt;You have to start the quest before the slot becomes active (I tried). Once the quest is started, you cannot stack the Technical Data.
---
So you drop all the technical data BEFORE you start the quest.
---
When you get in front of the slot in Fort Venture, you drop all the technical data except for one.
---
You then select/investigate the slot and start the quest.
---
You submit the one technical data you kept.
---
Then you pick up just one technical data from the batch you dropped.
---
Keep doing that until you submit all pieces of technical data individually.
---
I was told this works. They might have patched it though.
---
You could use a bigger sign
---
Ah darn!
---
Given how broken level scaling is times like this have been the only chance people have had to do basic quests. E.G. getting the sword from whitesprings as there's usually a few level 100's there 
---
1000 cap for 1 on Xbox hidden psycho84
---
So what ate they actually saying? 
---
Read the comments 
---
Thanks!
---
This game isn't 900 hours good you're gonna look back on this when your older and wish you didn't waste your time playing this game 
---
the wanderer literarally is perfect for this one but not in it
---
I also have a double barrel two shot and I love it! You see a crowd of enemies, one shot, no crowd. Well, before the nerf...
---
Before all the patching, it was possible to find multi primary weapons. I also had an instigating tse weapon. I wanna say it was a pipe weapon.
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
---
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
---
thief over there.
---
What's your platform? I'd be happy to give you one of mine if you're on PS4
---
I haven't spent a single ATOM in the Atomic Store! I never saw anything in there that I would be even remotely interested in. Gotta be some kind of record. Last I looked, I had somewhere around 7k atoms that I never touched.
---
I just jump on a roof in my hazmat suit and snipe enemies until they are dead. Loot, and move on to the next roof area, using cars as high ground. If you are a decent shot, the radiation is way worse than the ghouls. Hazmat negates that.
---
Were you wearing a duster?
---
Pick a specific style gun and build around it Heavy/Shotgunner/Rifleman...like if you like lever actions build around that and go with rifleman and expert rifleman and so on it will enhance your weapon damages 
---
&gt;Then Beth halves the prices and what happens is that people are still not spending the money, because atoms come relatively easy to come. 
---
Cut the handouts at the same rate you cut the prices problem solved 
---
P.s. They need to be cut to a tenth to equal creation club value, and a hundredth to equal classic dlc value 
---
&gt;who cry over every little thing,
---
Game shouldn't have been made so it will be raked over the coals until it ceases to exist this will be a warning to all publishers what happens when they try to cash out on thier good will.
---
Any kind of hub is absolutely pointless without a text chat. The majority of players do not use Mic's including myself.
---
Imossible to communicate using 5 useless emotes.
---
Expect more solo sessions as hardcore fans give up on this trash
---
So much plastic at whitespring too. My shotguns love that.
---
Ya I don't want **everything** from the shop so I don't have any issue.  I did drop $10 to get enough atoms to buy the patriot power armor paint job though since that one I had to have.
---
But I seem to earn enough atoms to pick up things as I see them, they need to buff miniguns so my chrome can be wheeled out more often.
---
Plus to be honest you could farm them by doing the little challenges daily if you're so inclined.
---
No
---
ur probably confusing it with signs and letters plan. small letters set usually only go for a couple hundred caps
---
F
---
Hm I didn't change any files. Would deleting them help me then?
---
I can't stand the UI for power armor. To me they're overly obnoxious to wear.
---
On top of that I have a very sneaky sneak build which works fine wearing hazmat in Nuke zones.
---
I also have a few perks that help with defense so I can take quite a beating still.
---
I thought these were just the station locations, and are the same in every one. 
---
Here on reddit, a guy that knows a guy... (Theres one picture but ofc could be fake). Nothing confirmed anywhere els more then rumors. I got the initiative paint atm, gonna farm technical data for some time and see what I get.
---
Well the gatling isnt auto, its fast semi auto with terrible aiming. The large 5mm ammo reserves is what kept me going 
---
If a new character exits the vault and sees you, they must've *really* overslept.
---
Yes, boost them to 100. Make me consider keeping them.
---
And / or allow them to be scrapped and generate predictable flux.
---
I feel we see too many legendaries (world is full of the, but mostly useless). Boost them, make them useful or just drop them.
---
The only reason I ever have for one right now is on new builds as a placeholder so i dont accidentally scrap or sell my weapon. Exterminators sniper rifle is safer when vendoring/scrapping than a non legendary. 
---
Not to sound dismissive, just wanted to confirm.
---
So some high level guy helped you with a difficult quest and then initiated a trade where
---
He overcharged you for something. 
---
You were able to catch it and then back out of the trade.
---
Is this correct?
---
because it has less ballistic and energy and still doesn't have enough rad resist.
---
and it uses ultracite.
---
You can choose the social option before entering the game and join them.
---
I've got to point this out since it seems to be common misinformation. Enemies only respawn in an area if a player new to that area on that session enters the area.
---
Shouldn’t you be contacting Bethesda directly instead of Reddit?
---
u deserve it
---
😊
---
I liked the copper near Charleston station. Near the power plant, the trader walks up that road. Only gets cats, ragstags, and beavers. 
---
Yeah no more after as far as I can tell. I have arms but need the other two. 
---
Once you select what module to load (SeventSix.esm) you should then see the esm and the fallout76 exe listed, you can expand them into sub categories and either right click on the category you want to run the script on, or expand the sub categories further and right click an individual entry to run the script on that entry only.
---
Hopefully this gif showing it helps

---
Just happened to me for first time, the bugs in this game are rediculous. Especially annoying since I just got kicked from the game right at the end of a daily quest. If I want the reward I gotta do it all over again but I say “fuck it, buck buck bucket.”
---
I got wanted for hitting by accident a metal box while helping a low level player defending a workshop. I enabled pacifist mode when I was level 3. 
---
Locked doors only encourage people to destroy your door. Players can’t really steal your stuff other than water or resources from extractors. Usually people just want to use a work bench or stash box
---
tHERE'S A shack south of watoga just across a small stream that has a weapons workbench in it.  its not far but sometimes you have to fight to get there
---
Never feel bad. I'm sure less than 10% of the lower level characters you see are actually new, likely just people making new toons. 
---
Yeah, because Beth knows your friends better than you.
---
Yeah i don't get that. People seem to want spoon fed everything. 
---
Time to make a choice. 
---
Do i want to play with some friends or go on a new server and potentially make new ones?
---
Or do I just join a server and do what i want...
---
Instructions unclear, got dick stuck in ceiling fan.
---
Happened to a friend  of mine and he got an email that said the beta had ended and he needed to use his code to play the real game so he is currently uninstalling and reinstalling will update if that works
---
Awesome post thanks a bunch
---
Never. I must try this.
---
Typically I just drown my vanilla ice cream in chocolate syrup like he has the same name as a guy who owes me money, but hey, shows what I know about proper dessert crafting.
---
Yes, you said your client, I’m just emphasizing that it should be fixed. I totally agree with you
---
I thought I read that there was no modding for FO76. Huh but that would definitely make the game more challenging for end game users wanting to challenge themselves. 
---
im on ps4. i have some antiarmor weapons if you want one
---
grow bored very fast in Appalachia. All the time. More often than I play for fun.
---
Make a rule for yourself- Do I sell in the morning or in the evening. I set my self rule that I don't sell anything to vendors till 20.00, this way I knew every evening vendor caps were refreshed. 
---
Whoa. 
---
Brilliant! That's solved it thank you. So I was passing the script as an argument to fo76edit.exe (since I didn't know to execute scripts like this) and it must just use the whole .esm without giving a chance to choose which subcategory if done that way.
---
Can confirm I'm getting what looks to be a perfectly correct output with no obvious errors.
---
Thanks again dude.
---
No mod support ATM same as  well as no private servers... But there's already mods on PC making glowing meat piles drop bags plans bobbleheads better maps all kinds of 4k textures and most helpful a text chat mod
---
&gt;  as another pointed out... a player took the workshop, built it then either was killed, left the world or game and the workshop was available but what they built was still there. 
---
*I* pointed that out, but *you* said:
---
&gt; they were still on the map
---
&gt; again both players were still on the map 
---
So were they on the map or not?
---
I've also noticed it does seem to be a way to bypass the whole 1,400 caps less travelling expenses that Bethesda has imposed. Get the ability to craft something in demand for peanuts and sell it at a huge profit, like Hunters Longcoats for a couple hundred or some serums for a hundred.
---
Thanks. I'll add you next time I'm on my main.
---
I admire your ability to get into these areas with pretty hard enemies. I’m only level 36 and I feel like I’m doing the game wrong sometimes because if I can’t kill *it* from sneak, I’m dead meat. 
---
That has kept my wandering to a centralized minimum. 
---
I don’t even know how anyone gets TSE’s without nuking an area and killing everything, which I’m way too weak to participate in.
---
So far, not at all. I'm in no hurry to get the best gear because so far I haven't run into anything that I couldn't handle without a top loadout. Although I have to admit that I'm getting a bit tired of the shitty RNG this game seems to use. At lvl 151 the literally best guns I have are a lever action and a TS Handmade. Which I rarely use since my bloodied power fist does short work of almost everything I come across.
---
I have received several 2* exterminator left arm combat armor with +25 rad resistance from the same legendary ghoul in whitesprings parking lot. Every time I sold that armor it dropped again until I just said fuck it I’ll keep it until something better drops...nothing better has dropped. 
---
I just dont like power armour 
---
Hey Cyberhawk. I understand so many people are asking you, but if you would be open to help trade one to me I'd really appreciate it. My name is: legacys, i added you. Thank you so much in advance.
---
Miner's uniform is a good look. I like to wear it with the baseball helmet. Go full blue. xD
---
It's sooo floofy!
---
I almost entirely depended on it because 3 star legendary enemies seem to only wanna drop 1 star leather mutant slayer crap or dumb guns like troubleshooters pipe pistol or something.
---
Problem is, now i have the guns and melee i want, all the armor i want, almost all the costumes i want, all the serum recipes i wanted and am at max caps. I now have no idea what is left in the game for me.
---
Legit. 👓
---
Only for legendaries. It's nigh impossible to get the legendaries you want through grinding, or even just the right weapons/armors with any decent legendary effects. So I usually keep an eye out on trading forums for any legendaries that might interest me. Glad I've never been interested in the "meta", otherwise the search would be a lot harder and more expensive.
---
I've also bought some mutation serums from other players, and I think once some crafting plans. But anything that isn't a randomized drop, like rare crafting materials, ammo, or healing items, I'll just get through gameplay. 
---
Really? I grinded mine... Lots of blood... Im gonna go sleep now...
---
I wouldn’t feel bad abt killing them. They got the alert that the nuke was dropping. 😂 Scared the shit out of me once. I was dozing off and had my headset off. That alarm went off and I almost shit myself. 😂😂
---
Doesnt jumping off a cliff clear it for you?
---
I did not like it. I was able to do some nice damage(much better than my explosive build), but the addictions don't last that long, so I would have to constantly use drugs to keep it active.
---
Went back to my explosive build.
---
I'm on there multiple times daily. Level 200 plus but no stellar drops on my own. Trading there and with other players has me into the best gear in the game and tons of caps. Trading is one thing I wish destiny would do.  I understand rng in games but when you run the hardest content non stop yet dont get good gear it grows tiring.
---
You go to heaven 
---
There are some clothing underarmor "outfits".  The Flannel Shirt &amp; Jeans, and Undershirt &amp; Jeans mainly.
---
Yes, I’ve seen this happen as well it does seem like a way for the loot to drop after the original legendary corpse doesn’t spawn the loot fast enough. However I wonder if this is effecting the 3* drop rate since most of the time I’m looting a 1* or 2* item from two different normal corpses. 
---
Mole head and Cannibal sound like a ridiculous combo. I get it looks horrifying. xD
---

---
I wouldn’t feel bad abt killing them. They got the alert that the nuke was dropping. 😂 Scared the shit out of me once. I was dozing off and had my headset on. That siren went off and I almost shit myself. 😂😂
---
Looks good. That a BOS armor?
---
But wouldn't people get annoyed that thecool stuff was behind a pay wall and not just in the game? 
---
How peculiar! Maybe the reason we get so many useless loot is because we keep selling them and the game recycles them for subsequent loot drops!
---
G
---
So clearly you have never played an online game ever. I can have 5 friends on GTA Online and I will join a lobby with none of them in it. 
---
Love the dedication. 😁
---
Any chance the videos you watched were a bit older? May sound dumb but if you did not know they nerfed some guns into the ground and if watching older content you wont see recent damage output.
---
Another option is running adrenalin. This will really buff your weapons damage in mobs after you got a few.
---
Did you ever suck the jelly out of a jelly doughnut and then fill it with chocolate swirl ice cream?
---
This is the problem of trading for anything you want
---
So you have never played a shooting game that wasn't CoD or Battlefield have you?
---
Classic. 🤠
---
These all sound like good combos. I'm missing a lot of these pieces. Gotta keep explorin.
---
Yeah it's literally not possible and the guy below is lying too lol.
---
No lol, no I didn’t. Everything I said applies to how the game was handled before the game was released as well. 
---
I've earned over 11k atoms so far, and I've only spent 4k. I still earn 500-600 atoms a week. I'm not spending 2k atoms a month, so I'll probably have 20k in reserve if I'm still playing a year from now. 
---
Very sorry this happened to you, its like a kick to the balls. Consider sending your details to Valseek per the post he made. It wont restore your gear but may help track down how it happened and lead to a solution (other than what people have suggested) in the future. Also never heard of that mod as I don't use them, but SaveMyStuff may lead me to doing so. I'll check it out.
---
I wanna see a post of you base
---
Totally is. But no new content also doesn't help. To be entirely fair, the grind for items and caps to trade for things has kept me in the game far longer than what the game has to offer otherwise. Once you hit level 50 and smash SBQ a few times there is little to nothing to keep you in. Im pretty close to lvl200 so i feel that about 100 of those levels are thanks to trading subreddits 
---
All Bethesda games are riddled with bugs. Not just 76
---
"2 French guys...strike boards in our hand"
---
Imagine my surprise.
---
R &amp; G Processing Services (Outside Silo Charlie) is a pretty good legendary spawn point for legendary 60+ ghouls.
---
Yeah, unfortunately that's how it is.  And eventually you get tired of getting so many duplicate plans that you break down and buy the one you want instead.
---
I wish the system was more intelligent, where it would look through the plans you don't have and give you one.  The Powering Up quests have that ability.
---
Here's my logic, the developers make new areas extremely resource heavy to front load the scarcity for new players. I'm willing the bet the respawn rate in flatwoods due to the traffic is much quicker. At the end of each gameplay I'll port to flatwoods and dump the excess into cash register in front of the flatwood responder vendor.
---
There was one time I saw the lead weights available to buy at the vendor, guess a new player needed the caps more.
---
I think the flack is against micro transactions more
---
No worries, glad you got it working! Look forward to seeing what you can make out the data
---
Hey, atleast someone's having a good hanukkah.
---
The irony of celebrating the fact that you don’t have to deal with the games entire multiplayer premise. Nice.
---
I'm on PS4 in the UK and was playing til I went out to the shops about half an hour ago no problems. Maybe some servers are more unstable than others?
---
Wondering the same as all the places are always empty when I check them out...
---
What does that mean? There's no words on it
---
More power to you, I couldn't waste 100 hours on this game. Its fun with friends and its fun for a while then it gets grindy. Let alone the quests are mediocre. Bethesda marketed the game wrong and now the fan base suffers. 
---
What? I never knew that. Road trip!
---
Then you have nothing to lose. There are a couple of strategies so you can get bored of you: running right at them so they one-shot themselves probably; killing yourself in front of them via explosives so they don't get any caps.
---
When you do contact Bethesda you get the generic reply saying that you need to purchase the game.
---
&gt; Toxic Larry's always spawns 3 snallygasters.
---
Now he tells me, having just died 3 times.
---
Anyone still looking to boost these two?  I’m on XBone as TheWallsOfDeath and need a buddy today.
---
6h still can't login, ticket ignored :/
---
It reminds me of that presentation they did for Skyrim, I think it was before Dragonborn came out, where they were showing off new things they did. It showed that they made moving platforms in their dungeons and things you'd think would be pretty simple in a less-dated game engine. It's like they wanted a pat on the head for it. Does anyone know this video? I think it ended with a giant mudcrab claw piercing through the ice (something I think they recycled for the ice breaking dragons in the Forgotten Vale)
---
They do have enough money to keep all those employees and even hire more. The problem is they have to show constant growth for their shareholders and so every measure must be taken to ensure that the next year is more profitable than the current. This video perfectly explains it
---
https://youtu.be/HmW0GhdDOvw
---
No you can't get a bounty from not defending a workshop. They're referring to the fact that if you own a workshop and another player contest it, it flags you for PvP to the contestor and their party members anywhere on the map.
---
I've run into a couple of 2-3\* that did not drop anything, mainly inside WestTek or the Watoga Clinic. Maybe the remedy can't work inside properly as you run out of enemies in that specific cell. Its hard to test as 2-3\* are rare and often do drop.
---
Wooden Armor isn't awful, so long as you have the shrouded mod and use stealth a lot.
---
It's just crippled due to the fact that for some reason, they can only spawn as a 1*
---
Thank you for this
---
Just wondering I had about 120 hours and I got bored but what do you do that makes you stick to the game even though you have done all the missions like what are you working for
---
Are you serious? Perhaps the dumbest suggestions I've ever heard. Someone comes to crash me and destroy my base, so I should kill myself with explosives? 
---
This is exactly the content I want from this sub, I’m a frankly absurd 420 levels lower but it’s great info. 
---
All games have bugs. It's just that most are not game-breaking, and 99% of the people who play the game never come across it.
---
The problem with Fallout 76 is that many of the bugs were pretty bad and fairly common.
---
Server disconnects, duping issues, quests you couldn't complete, perks that didn't work, etc.
---
Yes of course the model depends on you spending them
---
When you have your loadout where you want it, grab the weight reduction perk cards. You don't have to have it loaded but boy it comes in handy when you're over-encumbered and need to fast travel.
---
Did you log out to the desktop? If you only log out the main menu of the time you will load back into the same server.
---
I have a 2004 GMC 3500 that has the regency package. This means it has leather seats and a bunch of other creature comfort not normally found in a 1 ton truck. Those leather seats contain the seat belt, it comes out of the top of the seat next to your shoulder. Over time they always start to make a little noise, squeak a bit and I have to try to get some WD40 or some other grease in there to stop it. The drivers side seat has started doing this again and last week as I was driving into work I kept looking for that damned officer out the window because it sounds exactly like that incessant beeping now.   
---
Aren't the responders and raiders people that were around after the bombs dropped?
---
&gt; They must have actually fixed something.
---
Stabilized the servers. Unfortunately, the methods employed were based on existing players leaving in droves, and word of mouth limiting truly new players to a very thin and sad trickle.
---
I've been in area voice with people from other countries, so that's not true.
---
You could stop playing the game?
---
yes.
---
which means....synth fish!
---
If you're on XB1 I can help you out with some caps and mats if needed. There are also those of us who oppose Raiders and like to help, too! :)
---
I'm on PS4. But it's bullshit because now I have lost 600 caps and have no money at all. It's unfair how they can do this repeatedly and clear you out every time with no bounty. 80 caps is bullshit
---
I mean, if you do some of the take/defend Workshops, you'll be swimming in plans for your CAMP before long.  I'd say my CAMP is quite dense with stuff, but there isn't too much I bought from the Atom store (the laminate/astroturf floor and the Christmas lights are the main things).
---
There's also the possibility that your CAMP is just too big.  I see people build these giant 5x5 foundations and, yeah, you'll have trouble filling that.  It's a lot of surface area to cover.  If you want your CAMP to look full, go with something like 3x3 or 4x3 and build upward if you want.
---
I logged on to do workshop PVP but then after dropping 2 nukes captured all the tough shops as a challenge when it became a splinter server. Sure is more exciting when the possibility of PVP exists.
---
Everything I have is from the different marketplaces on Reddit. I found some decent 3star loot which I traded there for stuff I really wanted. Without the marketplaces, I would have some decent armor and weapons, but definitely not the exact set I wanted.
---
Ahh, balls man. Wish I could help.
---
Like another said, sometimes you need to wait a few minutes, or quit to desktop and re-open the game to switch servers. Sometimes it doesn't switch the server.
---
This is why pacifist mode should be made better, to avoid bored kiddies who just want to grief other ppl. On top of not doing damage to others and their property, they should not be able to damage you and your properties. That's how it should be.
---
I find that to be the problem.
---
When I play, I just want to play.
---
"Can't sell right now because it would put me out of sync. Should wait until the evening and then go about selling everything."
---
Also, selling all at one time is kind of a pain. You have weight restrictions and naturally you just want to fast travel to the 7 different factions and you can't carry all the stuff you want to sell.
---
I understand having a limited amount you can carry. "No, you can't collect 30 mini-guns to sell to a vendor." However, it's just a pain all around.
---
1. Scavenge/Loot.
---
2. Visit a vendor to sell.
---
3. Scavenge/Loot some more.
---
4. Visit another vendor to sell.
---
The above takes some time, and naturally the amount of time to visit all 7 vendors gets spread out.
---
And that folks is how its done
---
[Thanks for letting someone grief me and steal all my money daily](https://youtu.be/C8FecOqB5WE). This game is fucking trash and you should be ashamed you let people do this shit. Come in and destroy my entire base and all they get is 80 caps bounty. No penalty for griefing either. No damage reduction nothing. Fuck this shit. 
---
Sad tbh 
---
I was thinking scale the enemy's based on the different parts of the map like is already being done 
---
If anything useful comes, I'll let you know 😄
---
is it possible that you have the highest in game time of anyone besides devs so far? I wish we could find out. maybe you could build a #1 statue at your base or something. either way, nice write up bud. keep at it!
---
I can do Tuesday?
---
It's a 20 hour reset. its pretty consistent. honestly i wish it was a 15 hour reset to increase playability at different times. 
---
What I really want to know is the reset time on in-game junk. Haven't quite pinned that down
---
Yeah I don’t understand why a “Daily” isn’t repeatable Daily. It only gives me one per server. Lucky Mucker pops regularly for me, Dross Toss only occasionally. The hotdog one I’ve only done twice ever
---
I experienced this exact thing a while ago. A had a 10 cap bounty for something incidentally so probably attracted some unwanted attention when it happened. I tried going into my house but the walls just took damage and eventually broke and it was back to direct hits.
---
Every 20 seconds or so, I'd see an enemy name for a "Vicious Mongrel" pop up and immediately disappear but said Mongrel was nowhere to be seen. Similar to you, I'd see a something on the screen periodically, like an object wasn't clipping properly. It was stupid but I haven't encountering this since.
---
You're thinking small - why not get rid of the entire junk system. That's what you really want. Junk system is junk!
---
Magical inviolable box of teleporting hammer space isn't magical enough. This isn't a survival game - we're wasteland wizards! As wizards we should be able to build anything, anytime, anywhere.
---
Why even have equipment degradation. Why even have stats on anything! No more level ups, a gun is a gun, done.
---
Stupid is fun so this is the best idea.
---
You got to feel sorry for anyone wandering in a 25p game with PVP solo just collecting scrap and junk on his lonesome so this is obviously the way of the future.
---
Someone did this over me leaving their team
---
I keep an Exterminator's Combat Knife around just for situations like this.
---
With Kings, in melee, if you go right up into their space and try to stab them from behind, you tend to frazzle their AI a bit because they'll keep wanting to turn around and attack you.
---
Try moving the materials to your inventory 
---
Pacifist mode doesn't work. It's broken as fuck but the angry Fanboys won't listen. You can easily be killed through it repeatedly. It forces you to PvP because they just go destroy your base and antagonize you. The thing is.... People want pve servers but Bethesda is silent
---
Two shot dishwasher
---
I usually go the route of Flatwoods -&gt; Sutton -&gt; Whitespring -&gt; Enclave -&gt; Watoga Train, BOS Watoga -&gt; Harpers
---
Name checks out.
---
Go for Armor bypass/penetration above just upping damage percentage. I struggled too with my rifle build. Throw in some sneak multiplier damage too and you are laughin
---
not bulkable. I set a personal cap of 500, any excess I'll sell to the vendor. Ballistic fiber suffers the same way.
---
They expect us to organize ourselves. Instead you just use this forum to whine. Join me sundays!
---
No incentive aside from a constant stream of materials, rare ammunition, food, fusion cores, and power for other workshops.
---
Im lvl 30 and havent had lead in over a week....i have like 100 bullets left, kinda quit playing
---
I've passed that cap on springs and screws already haha. I have like 1340 springs and just over 1,000 screws
---
There’s always a bigger fish, there’s L400+ people roaming about!
---
You can't fight back and you can't lose any more resources. Death has no consequence for you. If they get high enough bounty, someone will take on them. Such griefers usually give up after an hour of getting nothing out of you anymore, yet they are spending ammo on you.
---
Oouu thanks! I'll check that out.
---
I really wish they had. Multiplayer has not improved my Fallout experience at all.  The sooner we get private servers, the happier I'll be.  
---
At least there's no offline raiding. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **7th Cakeday** JoeyHollywood! ^(hug)
---
Also a way to distinguish between power armors without having to pull them all out of the stash. 
---
Yep, maybe Tuesday evening, around 8:30-9:30 CST?  Just sent you a friend request.
---
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
---
Ultracite has the same TOTAL amount of DR for ballistic and energy as the T-51. They just moved DR from energy to ballistic, but it still adds up to be the same.
---
And ultracite has more radiation protection (453 &gt; 370).
---
And ultracite isn't that rare. I actually resorted to selling some of it to vendors.
---
I know. But it would be a kick ass picture if they were able to take it with a couple of players.... 
---
I send him a FR :D I'll get a 300 cap bounty and bait him into. Let's see how many caps he wastes.     
---
      
---
However, why you turned pacifist off? Just turn it on &amp; switch. Also he followed you via a friend you had not blocked and who followed you to every new servers.
---
Did you watch the video??? They were destroying everything with no consequences whatsoever. 
---
They are like mosquitoes. Annoying little shits.
---
Just swap in good with salt perk it should make everything last till you get to a bench.
---
But surely PvP servers are going to turn this dead game around, right?
---
Block. Them. 
---
First, there is a rule for no witch hunting. Second, did you seek revenge? Third, you did not have pacifist on as I can tell. Be pacifist, do not seek revenge and they should get a bounty increased whenever they kill you. Just pretend you want to attack them.
---
What's bps?
---
I have good with salt but only 1lvl it still goes down too quick by the time I've found a chem bench.
---
But ty for the tip
---
Oh no. Somebody was positive. Quick. Better *correct* them and mention canvas bags   /s    :/
---
Gross
---
Erm how is it possible to follow somebody that's not on your friends list? I'm PC, so please excuse any console ignorance.
---
I've of the Bethesda community people around here mentioned they were looking at adjusting both the durability and usability of energy weapons in an upcoming balance patch, so both.
---
Yeah just a pretty dumb move on your side to walk around with that much junk... Also, you should learn how ingame mechanics like pacifist mode work before complaining here. And last but not least, if you go for workshops, you leave yourself open for pvp. It even says so when claiming a workshop. Learn to read.
---
We need pvp servers with karma instead of a wanted system, and changes to pacifist mode in the regular ones. Tip, check your map whenever someone attacks you first or you wanna get a wanted player. They can use cooking stations to get through walls.
---
How can you put 900 hours into this game? I don’t understand that? They messed up the games there is no new content and now it’s so boring.
---
I understanding wanting more cosmetics or camp bits or whatever, but actively hoping they arrive on the atomic shop is like hoping aids cures cancer. 🤭
---
That’s whyI basically just said.
---
Well that's surprising, the last time I used this subreddit everyone was saying the game was awful and whatnot. Guess I missed a fair bit
---
What I said*
---
&gt;67% of the data is from the same server I was lucky enough yesterday to be completely alone in the last 8-10 hours.
---
hmm its not luck more like mark of a dead game...
---
Fo76 is entirely fucking around and hot garbage but let's not pretend dark souls PvP is super intuitive, or that "killing the host" isn't the same as just murdering someone.
---
Wow. Kind of sad how angry you get over someone disagreeing with you on the internet. You seem to be speekimg for everyone on the matter of GTA 5 being a bad game (presuming to speak for everyone). You say everythinf you have said is "%100 the truth" but Its almost all opinionated. You say I would excuse everything rockstar did while excusing everything Bethesda has done.... Again, the irony. 
---
I'll give you 1200 caps if you promise to never abuse the word "literally" again, with your promise in so much as a voice message. Straight up win for everyone in ear shot for the rest of your life! PSNid Enterres
---
To address your issues sometimes you just got to log off. I'm sorry when objectivity based philosophers are griefed; sounds like if you quit the world at the same time as the other guy there is a high probability you'd go to the same server.
---
There is another possibility that he was griefing you through one of your "friends;" who was monitoring which server you entered.
---
Personally i challenged these 2 guys at their workshop yesterday - sentinels TSE and unyielding unarmed and i knew to give up after 2 tries. My team didn't listen to me, plan, or rally so they lost way more caps. 
---
Who told you that this was fair? Asymmetrical PVP exists in Dark Souls, Rust, and many other MMO's. You should've known what you were getting into from the start. Those guys i was fighting were wizards with their legendaries; the results had nothing to do with aiming FPS skills.
---
Philosophically Bethesda expects us to organize our own fun PVP stuff, which i try to do (sundays) but 99% of the content here is obsessed with LARPing beta testers on this unofficial forum. So what you're left with is end game griefing since y'all refuse to organize.
---
It's not what you want to hear but be afraid. Too scared to build a base, too frightened to uncrouch. A lot of us are looking forward to that in Survival mode that's what makes RPing in 76 so great - it takes you outside of your comfort zone.
---
what and why are you farming? You can get everything under 100 hours
---
Sometimes when I'm bored (and my stash box is getting full) I just hang out near the overseer's camp and give out purified waters, food, and stimpacks.
---
I don’t see how this is a con?  If I walk into a store and something is marked up I can buy it elsewhere. OP is just dumb as shit. 
---
Da Comrade! Fallout 76 is good game!
---
I’m in UK so 8:30-9:30 CST isn’t the best I’m afraid.
---
May be that mod is worth 1800? I dunno, I don't use T60.
---
No matter how you  try to justify it or compartmentalize it the atom shop requires headcount that is not going into game development.
---
Someone is creating the in game items to be sold.  Its not just some low level tech guy updating a webpage to sell stuff on.
---
Judging from the screenshot, it looks like an authentication issue because if you had been banned it most likely would have proceeded past the login screen. The way it looks, it is as if it isn't even attempting to log in your account.
---
&gt; People want pve servers but Bethesda is silent
---
Maybe they shouldn't have bought a game with no PvE servers then? Vote with your wallet, don't hand over cash then complain about the product.
---
You’re welcome, hope it helps some. I’d get good with salt maxes if you’re having that much of an issue. Also get excavator PA with calibrated shocks on both legs. Might help with your movement. Though hiker perk maxed will cut the weight of the flux.
---
Server hopping on PS4 requires you to back out to the FO76 main menu. (Go to map press L1 then exit) Then log in and you will be on a new server.  In your vid you just respawned you'll always be on the same server if you respawn after death.
---
I got the same issue. Happened about 30 minutes or so. I still can login on my other account too.
---
Wrong
---
Blueprints maybe?
---
Why do 90% of people who play this game threaten to report anyone that hurts their feelings, no matter what? 
---
Your parents named you "Fuck you"?!
---
Wow, I was going to say something snide, but I guess I'd be cranky and prone to tantrums, too!
---
As soon as someone mentions they have "alts". They lose all respect from me. Maybe try playing smart instead of hoarding and cheating. But hey. Just playing the game here, not trying to break it. Inventory management is a survival tactic and a part of the game. 
---
* Hear, hear!
---
The expression is a call to the mob to pay attention to the speaker. 
---
Pedant, out!
---
My guess is that you got the mutation before but it didnt show up, let me explain, I would farm mutations in high radiation areas, and if I died to radiation but also got a mutation, it would say you got this mutation! but it wasnt in my effects, didnt work either, so I had to use radaway until that certain mutation was gone then I could actually get it if I farmed it again.
---
This was after I server hopped. He was there again...
---
I did think of getting ex PA but I'm more of an aesthetic kind of person over usefulness, I'd rather look good than get better dmg resistance or weight reduction, the ex PA Just looks so god damned ugly I just can't bring myself to do the mission to get it lol
---
But what would you do with an explosive missile launcher than can only fire 3/8 of a missile before needing to be repaired?
---
it's good for making lots of a caps if you sell what you get
---
Could any of the mod community create a mod that would track this automatically and centrally?
---
I admire your work, but I still feel the sample size is way too small to be meaningful.
---
I totally get this and feel the same way. You don't like Fallout, cool, don't play it. Personally I think Destiny is a shit game, just repetitive grinding to get fancy armor....so I don't play it. We all have different taste and enjoyments from games and that's ok
---
Also dont forget the perception perk that picks x2 plants
---
What’s the refresh rate? If I start at White Springs, head to Westek, then Watoga, will White Springs ghouls be back? 
---
I'm not sure I understand your question...
---
Maybe it’s just that the folk that are unhappy are more vocal than those that are happy to play around the bugs etc, it’s like with Amazon reviews etc I never bother with things I’m happy with but the moment I’m not happy I’m writing the requested review or answering the survey I’ve been emailed that I would normally ignore lol
---
That's not correct. The loot you get from the drops scales with your level, not the mole miners.
---
True 
---
Maybe weapons/armour with ghoul dmg+% or super mutant dmg taken-% etc. need to drop from certain areas/events. Everything is pure RNG meaning that all the target farming areas are the areas with the highest amount of Legendary enemies.
---
Maybe for example, Watoga should be an area which drops robot related Legendary effects and none of the other type and so on for certain other areas.
---
Enemies will stay invisible sometimes. I pull out a melee and just swing in the air in the direction the hits are coming from. Eventually you can kill the thing. Or on some occasions I'll see this really weird stick, graphical tearing that is also an enemy killing me. In that situation I can use vats to lock on to hit it. It's usually dogs or other ground animals.
---
It is correct, go grind it for a solid hour, you'll only get level 30-40 gear
---
that used to be the case, not for a long time now
---
If somebody is griefing you, you should block them. They cannot server hop to follow you if you have blocked them.
---
Dial up your OCD and avoid ever having to make that call.
---
The problem is that opens up so many griefing opportunities too.
---
Source: over 1000 hours in GTAO with passive mode. Even that had a cool down for it to combat this.
---
I don't have the answer unfortunately but hopefully we'll get something. For an example of using this for griefing: I trap you in my CAMP with a locked door while you're overencumbered and can't fast travel. I could leave you or just cause you unless hassle while stuck.
---
I started hanging out at the Overseers camp as well. I’m currently level 132 with lots of bulk junk, chems etc. And I’m at the point where I’d rather help everyone I can instead of wandering alone to places I’ve been plenty of times before. If anyone on Xbox wants some help with quest or need any items feel free to shoot me a message: Im JaBiRD 
---
Why would you? This game has done nothing to earn extra money spent on it yet 
---
silos are better farming spots for lead.
---
you can stealth in, clear the weight room, and stealth out without even needing to engage in combat.
---
Ha! Yeah not much for making it look good. I’d focus two levels in maxing good with salt and you’d be fine.
---
While it may not be good for end game gear it is the place for raider under armor linings.
---
1400??? What level are you? And what perks to make it up to this dmg?
---
Everything under 100 hours lol
---
They drop from that event?
---
This what happens when you don't read the tips on loading screens. Next time read, there is tip that helps exactly for this issue. 
---
But it sucks? My Daisycutter is only 150 dmg, the last random fatman I picked up was 450 dmg(though it weighs 20lbs vs the 6lbs for the Daisycutter).
---
If you're on PS4 I have a set you can have
---
Block for session. 
---
Good looking out, Frog but WHERE IS THE BLOATFLY SYRINGER POST
---
Who the fuck are you
---
They drop from any event in the Savage Divide
---
I understand - Feel free to accept the request and if we’re both on sometime, we can knock these out
---
Awesome! I am getting the same message. Bethesda just can't keep their game working. Fucking great
---
The bunkers with the towers for calling in supply drops also have maps.
---
It used to be the case? Worst "fix" ever haha. Any event would have been end game then
---
H
---
It's me, your cousin. Let's go bowling!
---
Thanks for sharing your wisdom :D
---
I don't understand
---
Some people sleep 8 hours a day but don't catch any flak for it...
---
Very little. I trade sometimes but not often.
---
Mostly I sell to vendors because for convenience.
---
I think in one hand its over priced.  In the other, the average player doesn't want a majority of the stuff that is on the shop.  A lot of people like fallout for the wasteland vibe and most of the stuff in the shop is too new or clean or immersion breaking.
---
I think if more people were interested in the stuff the shop was putting out they would quickly realize its kind of expensive.  The shop prices rival Apex and that is a F2P game.
---
Asking if the phantom devices duration is increased with stealth boy perk that makes stealth boy duration longer. 
---
What you should do is throw a hazmat suit on, go to whitesprings and shoot at the spawn there while other people are killing them. That way you get points. Ignore picking up junk do it you die, it's not a concern. Eventually you'll meet some good people to join in with. 
---
If you built your camp on a random encounter spot, encounters are either blocked or moved slightly. 
---
Never, unless somebody logs in, then goes there themselves. This causes the spawning, not a timer.
---
Where is the Freak Show located? I’m not sure if I’ve ever come across it in my travels or just wandered by it aimlessly.
---
Nice GTA 4 reference 
---
Did you do the quest early in your play through? If you did that's why
---
The game is pretty forgiving in terms of SPECIAL points and perks. If you were to evenly distribute the points you'd get 8 in each category. That's enough to try pretty much everything although not enough to specialize in any one thing.
---
The alternative would be to plan your SPECIAL points and perks out ahead of time before even starting which isn't everyone's cup of tea.
---
That fixed it, thanks.
---
Nope.. it's radworms. Not sure why I'd think that bug was fixed
---
Two  more weeks of playing and you'll be fine to go in any area. 
---
&gt; Kind of sad how angry you get over someone disagreeing with you on the internet. 
---
I'm not angry. Quite the contrary, actually. Irritated perhaps, but angry, no. 
---
&gt;You seem to be speekimg for everyone on the matter of GTA 5 being a bad game
---
No, i'm saying GTA Online is a bad game, which it objectively is. GTA V is actually pretty good. Much like how RDR2 is an amazing game, but RDO is a fucking shitshow with literally no goddamn content.
---
&gt;you say everything you have said is "%100 the truth" but Its almost all opinionated. 
---
Except GTA Online is complete and utter shit. It's a game where you literally have to fucking grind days and days and days at a time just to get anything. This is objectively true. That is literally the entire goddamn point of the game. It is a clusterfuck filled with degenerates on fucking flying goddamn motorcycles that will nuke your shit if you try to sell in a lobby. Rockstar even encourages this shit. 
---
It is a fact that the prices in GTA Online are fucking abysmal, and that the only reason they are that high is because of the shark cards, which have netted them billions of dollars since the game released. This is objective fact. 100% the truth. They even canned the single player DLC because of the fact that the shark cards sold so well. It is 100% worse than anything EA could have put out and you people will suck R* off begging for more.
---
&gt;You say I would excuse everything rockstar did while excusing everything Bethesda has done
---
I'm not excusing bethesda. I've said multiple times that they've done stupid shit with this game, but it is nowhere near as bad as what they've done with GTA Online. This is objective fact. And the fact that you act like it's not tells me that you don't actually play GTA online, or if you do then you haven't done so since the heists. 
---
Yeah thats a thing right should have just blocked them. Did you get third psn? Also I'm on PlayStation and would be happy to help you with caps and mats this evening just message me. 
---
Welcome, wish they would get this fixed.
---
It adds undiscovered map markers, but you still have to travel there on foot to unlock them as fast travel points. 
---
I'm still waiting to get my hands on one, honestly don't even care what it is. They're pretty fun to use.
---
I have been dabbling in pistols, shotguns, and explosives. And only using power armor occasionally. Level 37. I’m finding 2 ranks for a lot of perks is the sweet spot between cost and performance. Luck has a lot that are universally useful to all weapon types (like Bloody Mess increases damage across the board). I also think Can Do is great even at 1 rank since you can use it on trash cans and they are everywhere (gives Purified Water and Canned Coffee, which is great).
---
There is a legitimate complaint about the cost of items because they are pricing them too high if you are actually paying money. This game was a full priced game, and to ask for $20 per outfit after paying full price is ridiculous greed. So, I just grind the currency until there is something either worth the extra cost or priced right.
---
The game is pretty hard on low levels with low level gear... farm xp through events and missions in the forrest and level up gear along the way. I had the same struggle, even when I leveled up and didn’t level up gear at the same time... get a good idea of what build you want, and go for it... I changed from ranged/rifles to melee after level 50 - cost a lot of grinding to change... melee build also have the advantage of being able to use shotguns and big guns... perk cards in the same category...
---
Are you still finding 3 star legendaries? I'm finding a hell of a time outside SBQ 
---
post your IGN and what system you are on - I'm betting someone can assist you....
---
Ultracite Gatling Laser still shoots red beams. The ultracite lader rifle shoots green beams. No other weapons exist, so either the rifle has a bug or the gating... Seeing as it can melt stuff into green goi and ultracite itself is green, I'd say the gatling should also shoot green beams.
---
I know it's just visual, but hey... Please fix :) 
---
yes. well, you can drag the hours with doing fillers but that's just wasting time.
---
I meant more along the lines of enemies bring closer to my level. I’m only level 24. Most enemies I come across in a full server are 40+
---
I didn't even know there were separate ultracite ammo plans. I think all of mine were automatically unlocked from learning a corresponding prime receiver.
---
Not sure but I believe unarmed won’t work in PA, while 1h will.
---
Ok... Everything you say becomes worthless once you say that your opinion is an objective fact... which it is not. Also, of you weren't angry then you just have a very colorful vocabulary I guess. Look it up man, there are currently more GTA online players than FO76... The proof is in the poodong baby. Gya online isn't objectivly bad and Bethesda already ruined Fallout on their own.
---
Try clearing your data.

https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42916/kw
---
@Bethesda - I have posted about this on several occasions. It should be an easy fix, because it's simply modifying the UI. It ought to be a priority becauses it helps to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities. 
---
Just to add to this, OP said that they blocked them, but they kept following, and mentions a buddy. So there are a few things that could be happening here, assuming OP did actually block them. OP's "buddy" that is mentioned did not block them, giving the griefer somebody else to target for a server hop. The other possibility is that the griefer also has his own buddy, who remained hidden that OP and OP's buddy didn't notice, so the griefers buddy remained unblocked, hopped server to follow OP, and then the griefer followed.
---
Really blocking and server hopping is still the solution here, but you have to take care to block the whole griefing team and take note of what names are following to the new server so you know who is helping the griefer.
---
I do this a fair bit, especially these days as this is one cure for the mods cant be downloaded bug that is plaguing us at the moment.
---
But you are correct, this helps heaps.
---
Two - Handed Melee:  (Baseball Bat, Board, Chainsaw, Fire Axe, Golf Club, Guitar Sword, Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, Multi-Purpose Axe, Pickaxe, Pitchfork, Pole Hook, Pool Cue, Protest Sign, Ski Sword, Sledgehammer, Super Sledge, Spear &amp; War Drum)
---

---
Unarmed Melee: (Boxing Glove, Death Tambo, Deathclaw Gauntlet, Knuckles, Meat Hook, Mole Miner Gauntlet, &amp; Power Fist) **Cannot be used while in Power Armor**
---
You definitely need incisor and martial artist. 
---
A few questions I thought if while reading your excellent post. I really want you to know how much I and others appreciate your writing it up and sharing.
---
Are you running around overencumbered, or do you fast travel?
---
What would be the value of a LVL5 explosive 10mm for a LVL457? Trading?
---
Are any of your explosive weapons high-lvl? I’ve never seen one, but I often hear high lvl chars rocking low-ish lvl explosive or tse- are they really THAT good?
---
How do you fight Scorchbeasts with shotguns. I have many of the SG perks as you, (skeet, but not scatter), but I’m more of a sniper. My SGs appear useless against anything but VERY low level enemies. I can rarely target the SBs in air, and my sniper rifle and shotties are useless, so I tend to use my sad lever action in hip-fire mode to take out shots, then wait till she lands, and hit her with my mid-level AllRise (my only good weapon in the game).
---
Do you use VATS? If yes - always, often, seldom? Do tell. I’ve used it once, and never once for a killshot. In FO4, I used it perpetually.
---
Recall where you found the cranberry relish recipe? I haven’t seen a new recipe in weeks, maybe there’s a recipe location map I’m unaware of...
---
Any advice on killing Mirelurk Queens? I’ve never killed one - but I’ve exhausted all my ammo trying on MANY occasions. At this point, I’d sell my sister to kill one of these things.
---
What do you mean by “easily 100+ iron ore with excavator Armor and spamming E”? I clearly don’t know what to do with excavator armor, of which I have a full L45 set...
---
What do you use the sting wings for? Acid?
---
Personally curious: Why do you like WestTek so much?
---
Thanks again!
---
Oh....I don't actually know what phantom device is.... Learn something every day. Can you elaborate? 
---
you wont need good with salt. i've farmed mutated fern at fissure prime so many times. unless you are taking a break to eat dinner or something the flux wont deteriorate that fast.
---
Unarmed weapons are a class of their own but are affected by Incisor and Martial Artist.
---
If you want to check if a weapon is 1 or 2 handed, exit PA (if your wearing it), equip the weapon and look at how many hands are on it.
---
It's a crafted item from tinker workbench you learn schematics from mistress of mystery chain quest
---
Workshops are getting unusable for this reason too. I never build a workshop on a server with anyone over level 150 on there. After the second defend event they show up with explosive ammo and wrecking everything, taking nothing. 
---
Im looking for  a high location worh Water, i got a place that is way out of the way, only enemies I've ever seen there was a pack of low lvl. Mongrels...love the spot but theres no water 
---
Honestly, I kinda disappointed with this drop since it's a TSE. Mostly becaue it's level 30 and being a black powerder weapon.
---
Seems legit: You only lost caps if you fought back, and it sounds like you did so repeatedly against better judgement. You can probably repeair your whole camp in one click.  
---
This won't be in PA :)
---
Most likely an Unyielding/Bolstering combo.
---
192. It's bloodied multipurpose axe with swing speed. All 3 2handed cards, bloody mess in luck, nerd rage in intelligence, adrenal reaction mutation, twisted muscles mutation, radical in endurance, and herd mentality class freak and strange in numbers.(no unyeilding) I could prolly get alot more dmg if I had a complete unyeilding set and then took some fury for 30% more melee and food stacks so a couple extra 10%ers from food, and God damn a bobblehead and magazine. Bet I could toper out at like 2k+ hehe
---
Excellent, that's what I needed! Thank you :)
---
ABout 2 months real time - maybe 40 hours of game play?
---
Good tip about the PA!
---
Incisor and MA are in then I guess :)
---
Have you been closing the application from the ps4 homescreen? Because if you just quit to the main fallout 76 screen and hit play it will put you back in the same world
---
It's the "Hotter Rod" paint - it was a limited time offer in the Atom Shop.
---
Where's the nearest chem bench in and around watoga and the bog?
---
I so want to get 7 players to come play them all at once.
---
My health did have to hover around 20% mostly for nerd rage but I still averaged 1200 at half health/half radiated.
---
1045 central?
---
Yeah just saying if you want to know try equipping it while in PA. Unarmed weapons don’t work in PA. I believe they consist of gauntlets, boxing glove, and things that generally cover the hand. 
---
Does anyone know if there are any mods that can superimpose a map of unknown locations or something?
---
I've explored just about everything, but I'm a completionist, and I want to make sure I have them all :P
---
Yes. Closed out the application repeatedly. He somehow keeps finding me. Even when he's blocked completely.
---
We're still waiting for the Master Iron Fist and Expert Iron Fist. Unarmed used to be affected by the Barbarian perks but they removed it.
---
Yep and ur one of the cry babies that report people I'm sure. Get your hands on assassin sentinel armor and then go piping for hours. You'll be banned too because someone who doesn't understand the game, like your little baby butt, reports all willy nilly because he can't kill someone. That's why I was banned both times. So just remember when u assume things you're just making an ass out of u and me. Keep your stupid comments to yourself kid.
---
The limited camp budget, really puts a damper on spending atoms on that type of stuff. I already have a PA paint, and haven't seen a better one than the one I got. I'm practically always in my PA, so I don't really feel the need to buy an outfit. Emotes/profile pics aren't interesting to me. So right now they're giving atoms, and I'm not spending them. I don't see how you would, unless you were spending them to spend them. 
---
You raise good points. I wonder if they could use the flag that exists fir the Assassin’s prefix to solve it somehow.  
---
What platform? 
---
Fix is in next week's patch. So on tuesday, I'd guess. 
---
Do you mean the Gladiator perks?
---
Barbarian is defensive based on Str, and wouldn't affect melee damage in any case.
---
Unarmed does have the Talons mutation going for it though....as far as I know it stacks with Twisted Muscles.
---
Ah gotcha, thank you for the tip :)
---
&gt;level 457
---
Oh come on Bethesda, you couldn't think of a limit for players to reach? Not like it matters but still, lvl 200 would have good a good capping point .
---
Worked on mine at first, but for some reason it isnt. It's all dark or colour saturation is too much, distorting the pallet. 
---
[fo 76 weapons](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_weapons) 
---
There a link to types etc.
---
Oof sorry, I run a 2h build and I don't know the perks too well. Yeah I meant Gladiator.
---
I don't have a PS4 but on XB1 I can make my online activity private. if you can do that then nobody will see that you're online and playing Fallout 76 and then none of his friends can see that you're playing and join your game and then he can join theirs. The only other thing you can do is block everyone playing on your server as soon as you login.
---
Thank you!!
---
I don’t even feel bad for you. You are server hopping wrongly that’s why you end up in the same server -_- also I don’t know why you wanted to fight back if they are lv200+ when you are lv35 you are asking this for yourself. Sure they have explosive gun but people even threw fatman nuke on me and my health won’t even go down a lot if I’m not engaging pvp or wanted. 
---
cant find firecap outside of just one place
---
np, figured I got what you meant, but there are a few screwed up mechanics and it's nice to know about them when you plan :)
---
Thanks man!
---
Thank god someone else with the problem I got scared I was banned or something I look at email nothing irl what to do anyone ever find out how to fix?
---
If thats the reasons why you hated it, the no it hasnt changed.
---
Anyone on xbox get this login error? I logged in last night no problem!  I read about this login issue this morning and when I try to login I get the same error [4:8:2000].
---
There’s a Mire version as well. It drops from Mire events and quests. 
---
Ok, you and Zirfeld have convinced me that my idea is unviable!  A shame, because there is a subgenre of folks who play the game for CAMPing and I think there should be a way to let them build in peace.  Perhaps PVE-only worlds as another electable option at log-in. 
---
Did you ever get in I’m having same problem
---
And you sounds like you need help spelling. Lol
---
Now they're saying to power cycle if you're on console, but that didn't work. 
---
Do you alt+f4 to exit the game? Players who are having the issue on console reported crashing beforehand. Is it possible that those affected might have inadvertently left a "ghost" on Bethesda's server registered it as the player is still online when they aren't?
---
My main character regularly appears invisible to others.
---
Sometimes sitting down on furniture makes me visible but is hit and miss.
---
This is not something I intentionally trigger or I know how to either prevent or reproduce.
---
There is one in an outhouse deep in the northern parts of the Mire... can’t remember where but it’s there 
---
The main changes are much more stable servers, nerfed Demo Expert, nerfed Two Shot, nerfed Explosive, forthcoming PVP worlds, and some limited new upcoming content.   
---
robux
---
If the game is “dead” then why the fuck do you care so much?
---
I am interested in the Batman.
---
You could go low-tech and grab a screenshot of your map and somehow get it to a computer if you play console (not sure how that works)
---
Then you could grab an image of the completed map and use some free image editor to set the completed image layered under your map and make your image partially transparent
---
This is probably an obvious process when you were looking for less work but just throwing it out there
---
And how many hours does an average person have to play to get all the items they want? Probably a lot. That's the problem with microtransaction shops. They're almost always geared to make the 'free' route grindy so people are incentivized to buy with real money. 
---
In Fallout 4, how much grinding is there to get specific cosmetics? Outside of a small handful of quest items, there's none. It's a guarantee that if Fallout 76 didn't have an atomic shop, costumes and such would be much, much easier to obtain. 
---
There's also the fact that a $60 AAA title shouldn't have $20 skins. That's a horrible value proposition. 
---
I call bullshit on you. You did not server hop. He attacked your base and you fought back like a noob and died. So you made up this story about how he kept finding you. Stop making shit up. Also your entire Reddit comment, and post history is all about hating on Bethesda, and fallout 76, yet you keep playing this game. 
---
Ah, you're probably right, I honestly can't remember, not even sure what quest you get it from.   I have found explosive weapons to be pretty underwhelming anyway so it's no great loss.
---
Jesus Christ, he's done it again!
---
Different people like the game for different reasons.  Just because you might think it's boring, doesn't mean someone else does.  Just look at Minecraft, I play the hell out of it while my husband shakes his head wondering why.
---
I can understand OP playing the game this much.  I've continued playing from day one and would have played more of I hadn't kept getting kicked off.  I still love this game too and want to play it more.
---
Correct! Power cycling my xbox did nothing!
---
Why not make a portable base and just move it to you?
---
Oh it was a good idea you had. Griefers aren't stupid though and have good ideas too lol
---
I completely understand about camps. I've got back into YouTube a little to upload camp videos (not a big YouTuber, I have less than 50 subs - it's for fun rather than money). That's where I have a lot of fun; creating things either from imagination, real life or mostly making it up as I go.
---
I have a 32 hour and growing genre-hopping [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/9lgwxpmmjbaia8zg00r4my4wh/playlist/0S2apEVCepj1hl2mmpCReM?si=EOokp4wPSMqkRg1s937hrQ) of 20-60s music and a few old radio serials that I listen to while playing.  There are a few post-60s artists (Townes Van Zandt, Jandek, and Hasil Adkins) that I included because they have the right "feel" for the game. 
---
Nope just vault suit and fighting with a golf club 😂😂😂
---
Over 900 hours... good jebus aren't you bored?  I'm not sure how many hours I have, but at Level 58, map discovered, I'm losing interest.
---
Great. I have a suit. I’ll try it next time someone nukes a place
---
You get it as a reward for doing Ella Ame's quest for Rad Shield. Personally I'm happier with my anti armor mirv which is only good for racking up a bounty. 
---
I was playing a sniper for a long time and finally decided that even with a brotherhood rifle, it just didn't work.  Although I kept at it for a long time because I play a lot of solo and would pick off creatures fron long range. 
---
I'd suggest you get a handmade. Even a non-legendary handmade can be awesome. 
---
For a while I tried carrying around a 40 mm auto grenade launcher and also a missile launcher for scorchbeasts. You can occasionally force a hit using a crit shot, but I decided they were just too heavy. 
---
I finally started carrying a 50 caliber machine gun. I traded for a 2 star legendary that ignores some amount of armor, and does something else that's inconsequential. Accuracy is spotty and it's frustrating firing 1000 rounds into a scorchbeat to kill it when a melee player can one shot a queen with a fire axe, but that works pretty well for me. 
---
I would but I'm seriously reluctant to move my camp lol, I've got a nice setup in a sweet spot at the moment that took some considerable time to do
---
No, you logged back onto the same server.   The way to prevent that is close the game completely and take a break for a minute or two.  
---
Oh, well that's disappointing then, I am only lvl 59 now and did that at around lvl 53 or 54.
---
I killed one last night at sugar grove. 
---
It's exactly why we need to complain, we bought a product but some ppl are abusing the poorly made mechanics. We have the right to complain and demand that it gets fixed. If you buy a TV and it breaks 2 days after you bought it, are you just gonna sit there and not complain about the fact that you bought a defect product?
---
You can but it adds something with more immersion. I liked the custom station in gta, and used ghost busters music for mgs:v helicopter drops. If the radios in game are playing a song you pick once in a while it would be a neat treat, even if someone else heard their own song choice or silence.
---
Their support twitter is saying to either power cycle, buy the game, or submit a ticket. When you submit a ticket, the response is to buy the game because you are trying to access via the BETA, so it's a neverending circle of generic "don't know" responses, basically.
---
I know it's broken and I just explained how it should be so that these situations stop
---
We never had any when I was a kid.
---
I lived in a neighbourhood where people who were 200 years old kept coming around in weird metal suits and taking them.
---
Also if you had a desk fan or slightly used clipboard, you were screwed.
---
Damn duocentanarians.
---
On the flip side, maybe while he was trading stuff to you for free he forgot he had that mod and didn't want to give it away for free and put a price tag on it? People can set prices to whatever they choose and they won't get banned for it. Todd Howard isn't going to go to their home and scold them for trying to sell a mod to you for 1800 caps. 
---
It should be doing 400+ damage then, unless it's a mirv 
---
I can't help but feel the game thinks you are be online when you aren't. 
---
Hes out of work with an injury. Prob just plays all day instead of watching tv or whatever. 
---
Oh cool! That is the only major questline that I haven't run through yet, so that makes sense.  Sorry I can't help with your question
---
Any 3 star legendary can drop a TSE, doesn't have to be a nuke zone. OP mentioned Horde events - every single one of those has a 3 star horde boss that could drop a TSE or any random other legendary. Did one just today, was expecting a hard enemy but it was a 3* legendary Softshell Mirelurk, with 20 friends. Got a 3 star armour piece for about a minute's worth of work
---
Well don’t think going that route I’ll have to get rid of at  least 7 then end of paying 3500 plus to rebuy (not hard to make just tedious) 
---
They are honestly so annoying. They have an effective ranged attack, combined with a close range one. Plus I assume each one is level 5 but they turn out to be a pack of 6, all level 40 - 50.
---
Basically I'm saying they are a very good, effective adversary.
---
It is still fun to explore and hope that you come across a unique, powerful roll even if you may sell it to someone else who may enjoy it more. 
---
That's crazy man, niceb job 
---
You know Bugthesda... eventually... I'm going to get tired of being punched in the face... over &amp; over &amp; over &amp;... Smh.
---
EMS?
---
I found it especially boring because 90% of the music is direct from FO4, which I've already spent hundreds of hours listening to.
---
On another note, the great FO4 mod *More Where That Came From* is ported to 76, adding dozens of new period-specific songs (and a DJ) to the game.
---
next patch fix they're fixing queen drops, maybe you'll get the recipes for them and want to re do it in the future
---
Having a similar issue on PS4 but even when I am trying to sleep in Camp it's hard to find the right spot to sleep. 
---
People say they are bugged but I can't help thinking the challenges were added after the beta, when a lot of people picked up loads of these items. Because we aren't finding them for the first time, it's not counting them.
---
Just an idea. Could be wrong.
---
Horde events have a guaranteed 3 star horde boss
---
I just started playing like a week ago how could I have done something bad already? 
---
Music and getting agreements and stuff is expensive and tedious I'm sure. But I have said it before, if they were trying to make such a large online world they should have gotten a LOT more music to fill it. The songs looping after a fistful of songs or whatever is really sad. For 76, it would've been awesome if they had gotten all the music from 3, NV, and 4. Kinda reminding us all that this is where it all began in the timeline and that all those games were part of this world and national radio will be broadcasting all these songs for hundreds of years still.
---
I'm really thinking this is the case as well. I had to dashboard quit yesterday because the game froze, but then I didn't try to log back on until last night and I've had this message ever since. 
---
The Pylon is the Monorail line near Watoga.  If you go to Fort Defiance you can see the main hub ,follow those down the mountain.
---
I'm way past aggravated now. This is getting ridiculous.
---
A lot of gamers from all games need an Ego Check period.
---
I'm such a dumbass.
---
Thanks bro
---
3 people? yeah well good luck getting the other 2 people that still play FO76 to join you.
---
 The game runs well. I come from a Linux install where I spend most of my time. I only use windose for games so my game runs in a freshly booted win10 environment.
---
 Very few problems with my game.
---
As above.  Such a dumbass, thanks for the heads-up
---
All but three of my go-to items came from others.   The marketplace adds a lot of fun to the game.  
---
They either have two separate games running which means they bought the game twice have two separate accounts ect. Or they have a friend hold on to thier stuff while they swap characters and rejoin the team on thier alt. 
---
900 freaking hours played?! You need to write a Definitive guide for the game and get PAID. 
---
Radio towers and train stations are the best ways to learn new locations.
---
It's actually east. Typo?
---
The cat bowls still haven't respawned after 4 days for me :(
---
What is the tip? 
---
Seriously: you know it's coming. Take your medicine. I always try to collect bounties on my map, occasionally dying several times in the process for way more than the bounty is worth. I consider it a service, because as a rule, I don't loot brown paper bags. Unless you got wanted by trashing my C.A.M.P. 
---
I'm in, will be waiting by Watonga Station
---
Try Fort Defiance; it was my first love for finding plastic.
---
Eh, he can't work from injury and I'm sure most of us opt to play games when we're off of work. In fact I'm only really able to grind when I'm off for the weekend. This guy is just off of work for a really long time
---
Alright, quick question. (I've seen 4\* gear.)\[https://i.imgur.com/GyxjMMJ_d.jpg\] Where did it come from?
---
I buy Atoms each month to support the game financially.  
---
LOL. Camden Park is cool because of Chad and the Raider base. 
---
 The Fuzzy thing is madness.
---
If you have the shotgun prime receiver, how did you get it?
---
Yeah same here, I just tried logging in and it won’t let me
---
I absolutely hate them and as a low level melee character they're an absolute nuisance as VATS doesn't help at all.
---
I went to the Garrahan Mining Centre for the first time on this character today and instead of Mutants or Scorched, the whole place loaded in level 18 liberators. The buggers cut me to ribbons.
---
Yeah definitely will do, I’m free Tuesday through to Friday
---
Troll psyops....
---
And stop revenge you automatically are returned to PvP... Just respawn and he can drain your caps if you keep fighting back that's your money u wasted.
---
The guy at least gives new insight on the issue since I spotted other threads posting about this
---
Or join a friend's server that you were not in...
---
You are an idiot and this post is stupid.  
---
Everyone, click on OP’s post history.
---
Wouldn't it be great if they could program the weapon classifications to display in the weapon stat window? This would also help to determine which park cards affect what.. heavy, melee, 1h, rifle, etc
---
Each area has a recipe. They get rewarded for events in their area
---
how much you looking for? 
---
So bethesda told me this right now:  
---
    Greetings,
---
    This account has violated the Code of Conduct and Terms of Service by exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication.  We have determined that this account has acquired over 100,000 (one hundred ) of one or more rare in-game items in the last 30 days. 
---
     
---
    Due to the extent and scale of the violation, and what the game data shows, this account has been suspended until such time as this issue is fixed in a future patch.  Once the fix is live and confirmed, we will reactivate this account and notify you that you are able to access the game again. 
---
    This decision is final, and no further appeals will be considered. 
---
 I have never, NEVER even seen 100k items together, no stacked rare weapons and never exceeded the weight limit on my 3 characters. And obviusly never into duping.
---
 I sincerely entertained myself with this game and I do not understand the reason for this unilateral decision 
---
WTF Bethesda?  how do you check accounts? 
---
Same on ps4
---
Taking offers at the moment. Won’t be on till later tonight 
---
Getting the same thing my man
---
PS4 doesn't work that way. I tried. Lol
---
They can see your inventory. You may try to fool people here, but you can't fool the devs.
---
You say you never duped, but you are not denying owning over 100K of an item. 
---
That 100k nuka cola tho 
---
It's super gross that you likened this scenario to sexual assault. Shame on you.
---
Workshops flag you for PvP. This is an (actual) feature, working as intended/described since day one. Workshops are not the only way to get materials. Salvage is, literally, everywhere. Sometimes, we need to put our entitlement away, and remember that we share this space with everyone. Some people like to PvP. Some people will use these existing systems, and some will abuse them.
---
They are legacy items that no longer drop.   
---
Thats fairly grim news but thanks. Now if only any of the friends I used to play with who could do that mod hadn't already left.... :(
---
Feels bad. I don't know why they can't make a patch that doesn't result in so many issues. 
---
Yeah... This doesn't sound right at all.
---
Let's not get too ahead of ourselves here :P
---
Would like some reply from Bethesda , because if we can't even trade safely in game what is the point of playing?  
---
Should we always be in fear if items you are buying are duped?  
---
Also if the account is banned for violation etc. how come they did not know that from start?   
---
Fishy business ....
---
I have just been playing on my alt account wasting time. 
---
Take it up with support. If they messed up they will be able to address it. Not to be rude or dismissive, but posting this here does nothing for you really. We are just people that play the game like you. Maybe a community manager will see this or something. 
---
Where in Harpers out of interest?
---
Mistake on my end, not writing that in. I do not and have not owned 100k of an item. That's insane
---
Pacifist?
---
Thanks for doing this, OP - very interesting to see actual numbers.
---
Did you have large quantities of any rare items?   If so, which ones?
---
You could just buy the serums off of other players. I payed 150 caps per serum. So you wouldn't have to spend too much to get them back.
---
Yup been happening more. 
---
When clearly we have bought the game otherwise we wouldn't be having these issues. Lol
---
That's over an hour a day. Haha
---
So, what your saying is they are fine as it stands. As if you like me don't want to you don't need any weight reduction perks. If I go overweight I may equip them to move to the nearest vendor or stash. 
---
One exception is traveling pharmacy and that's mostly just cause I hoard chems to give to noobs when I pass them, otherwise my few hundred super stims would overweight me.
---
I still collect plans I don’t need just in case I run into new people.  I’ve also gotten into the habit of taking selfies with people at their camps. I figure they get a kick out of having their work appreciated, and I get an awesome set of load screens.
---
That's still like 9 hours a day 7 days a week since launch.
---
It... just works?
---
*My god I can't believe I just said that.*
---
Nope
---
Looks like a black powder rifle. Quad barrel?
---
I would like to meet a noob that takes down a high level wanted player. Oh wait they dont exist atleast not that ive seen. Seriously even i tried killing a wanted player several times and the one getting a beating was me and not them
---
Lol more like 4 hours some days and 0 on others but ok so I'm medium casual. I don't have 400 hours!
---
if someone attacked my camp, I need to see his camp on the map. 
---
Sounds like u need to walk or move ur camp 
---
cool
---
No I hear you man. Haha
---
Might be a bit late but for whoever is interested. Delivering technical data has a chance of giving you these (clean) army fatigues. In game name is "Army Fatigues". They look like the clean version of the military ones you find laying around.
---
You can't fool devs? that's your comment? Seriously get out of bunker and start using brain.  
---
THey are changing story about items/duping etc. from patch to patch
---
We can't see what is duper, oh wait now we can, we can't do anything about it, oh wait we can delete dupes, smell a bit of bullshitting from them?   
---
Stop assuming that everyone who is banned is guilty of something.  
---
Why they never say directly "you had 500000 nuka cola caps and that's why you are banned? Hard to say something you have no clue about, easier to say "you are banned because of violation" and not providing any proof.
---
Well easy, if you go into sneak with a black powder pistol which is easily the highest dmg weapon early game for noobs that find them and shoot them in the head it's almost a one shot. 
---
Another recipe for disease cure is glowing resin and fireberry and boiled water..but the forest version is much easier to craft
---
I have lots of boiled water.
---
FYI pacifist mode does not protect you against hostile players. It says so in the tooltip - "Other players can still murder you". It just prevents you from becoming wanted on accident. I suppose it would help him by making it impossible for him to initiate full damage combat.
---
The bounty system is either broken or they are haking because i was helping a friend out with a few trophies, he needed to murder like 20 times and revive that many times and i helped him with the second one and my bounty got to the hundreds and yet when people murder me their bounty is either 5-20 when mine starts off at 50 each kill
---
Yup, defended it, tested it, was proved wrong:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqatn4/i_am_an_idiot_my_view_on_uranium_fever_loot_was/
---
Take OP with a grain of salt. It never fails in any game when the devs do a mass wipe of cheaters people flood into the various forums "I never cheated" blah blah blah. It's almost like someone might go onto the internet and lie....
---
Not to mention it is a brand new account with zero post history prior to this. 
---
Fishy business indeed. 
---
I've said it many times before and will say it again, PvP should have never have been added, and should be removed, the upcoming survival mode should be the only form of PvP.
---
Just last night I was hanging at my camp and got a message sent to me.   Open it up and all it read was SoS?
---
I look the person up in game and see they are lvl 2 and hanging at the Overseer's camp which is a short distance from my own so I head down to see what's up.  I get there and the lvl 2 is running around andthere is a lvl 100+ also there, so my first thought is that I am about to get griefed(I'm a lowly lvl 59).......but no, the lvl 100+ is crafting away at the work benches, seemingly creating stuff for the noob.  I then went and threw a pile of chems, water, magazines and stuff in to the Overseer's stash box for the noob.
---
I know stuff like that is pretty common, but it's refreshing to see and help with when most of the posts on here are people complaining about griefers or glitches.
---
December 11th patch fucked that unfortunately (Patch 5). 
---
Exactly what I'm think. No where in his story should he have lost caps unless he engaged pvp. Repairing your camp costs materials not caps. Def a bullshit story
---
Recently I noticed a wanted level 40 player at the very top of the Toxic Valley. I fast traveled nearby and when I got to his camp he had fortified it: the only way in was through a locked door. I scouted the perimeter for awhile in my PA (like a shark circling it’s prey) and then said fuck it! Busted the door down with my trusty Grognak’s Axe and murked him before he knew what happened :) 
---
I'm getting the same problem from today
---
U have chameleon armor equipped
---
Just wondering what keeps you playing? This game got so old so fast for me? Love to see why some people play this much
---
Did they say if they ever plan to reintroduce them?
---
This is the REAL FBI, delete that shit right now
---
You know, another interesting aspect about Iron Fist is that the loading screen tip talks about increased damage *and stagger chance*.  But, it's not mentioned on the card at all, and the wiki suggests that it was part of a cut Rank 4 and 5 Iron Fist that aren't available in the game.
---
i had this issue. and i solved this a few seconds before posting this comment. i just fast traveled. after that i could exit the armor. hope this helps
---
This is exactly what they said to me, too. I have never seen 100k of any item, or items, ever, and I've never made more than 100k ammo. This is ridiculous. 
---
Yup, go to map, settings. Choose "Game", and you'll see an option "Pacifist Mode on/off". Choose on and you can never accidentally get a bounty again.
---
If you want to level the camp of some dick-featured baboon who built a turret nest at the back door of the golf club you'll have to turn it back off again though.
---
&gt; If you buy a TV and it breaks 2 days after you bought it, are you just gonna sit there and not complain about the fact that you bought a defect product?
---
The product is working as designed so this is not a valid comparison. Unless you went out and bought a TV that says 'Breaks in 2 days' on the label then come back looking for a refund 3 days later.
---
OP story has too many holes in it. Sounds like someone tried to engage in pvp and died repeatedly. As a pvp'r you can not kill someone in pacifist unless you stand there for 10mins+ wailing in them. TSE bobblehead glitch is long gone.
---
Doesn't that tell you something
---
Thats exactly what I do to those camps as well. Then as added good karma I go to flatwoods and try and find a low level player to kill me for my bounty. 
---
I spent a few dollars on the garage door because it was something I wanted and it was reasonably priced. No clue why people hate it so much 
---
I
---
What's ur PSN? I can hook u up too
---
No problem man we all get confused sometimes you ain't a dumbass +karma
---
It bothers me that they explain it away from terminal entries. Half assed attempt at lore. You telling me that the 'best and brightest' cant override the system halting power, or even bust the door so it doesn't close? Bullshit.
---
When you fast travel to it, there is a building to the left with a hole in it. In there are showcases and in one should be a plan. 
---
Apprend 2 langue apres vient me redire sa ducon
---
Question: why do they set those up? The player wasn't even there, and you don't get xp from turret kills if you don't tag the mob. It doesn't make a lick of sense to me, unless they are just wanting to hoard meaningless kills to be dicks...
---
I have the same problem if I am banned what gives them the fucking right to sell a game to people then ban them fuck Bethesda bunch of fucking crooks if I dont get back on line by tonight I'm gonna talk to a fucking lawyer about this bullshit 
---
Bruh if an area is tough u need to go somewhere else to level
---
The medical place in watoga
---
All these positive posts lately - am I on the "other" forum?
---
Level 57..never used PA
---
I play with him , he is not duping , we have few more friends banned for no reason .
---
One friend have acc banned for duping and crafting , he is such lazy bastard that we are repairing gear for him , he never crafted anything...
---
Other is having mule acc banned as well , mule acc he literally only uses for dumping items from queen farming etc.
---
No explanation whatsoever from bethesda except that "violation" 
---
So yeah, that is fishy bussines...
---
Intended? Lol no. Their intention was to have all encounters scaled to the level of the player. They just failed to do it right 
---
Doubt you got banned unfairly.
---
I also doubt that you even own Fallout 76. Your account is a month old and this is your only post and comment.
---
 I'm sure I've shared or bought (in caps) duped items since the market is full of them, but I've never crafted massively amounts of items, this is more than ridiculous i have no words
---
I'm actually glad this is getting downvoted so hard, seems like the community's starting to like 76 again
---
Some people have cheats or glitches which allow them to world hop and follow you no matter where you go. They can see you through walls, etc. Salty Fanboys don't want to admit that 
---
I'm sure the reason this happens is because you discovered the locations before they patched the challenges in. Only explanation I can think of. I've heard using an alternate character (new) to rediscover the location will complete it. Not tried as I'm too lazy and not desperate for the atoms yet!
---
Going market price is 200 now..just go on the market subs to request them 
---
A month old account that has never posted outside of the market subs until today backing up a fresh account with no posts. Sounds legit to me.....
---
It’s entirely different. The Souls games are balanced around pvp. The host has to beat the level while the invader tries to stop them. There’s an actual game there. The invader gets a reward, and plays the role of a mini boss. And typically, being invaded is balanced by summoning friends.
---
In Fallout 76, the only point to pvp is to be a dick, just like it is in all the games they said this wouldn’t be. The pvp mechanics are complete nonsense. Again, comparing them is laughable.
---
If you’re looking to farm endgame legendaries there is a place
---
Does it tag the loot?
---
Why so salty bro? Been banned or something?
---
Never, I just use what I find. If I had everything I really wanted already by trading there wouldn’t be as much reason to log in and play
---
Oh, because there are never bugs, right? this game has never seen any bugs I'm guessing. No one has ever cheated. Definitely not duplicated anything, or used hacks in PvP. Nope. Many times upon logging in, Even after exiting out of the game, it may place you in the same server. He obviously found some way to find me every time I closed out of the game and came back. 
---
Also, I have absolutely nothing against Bethesda. I like many others hate some of the aspects of this game, namely the broken PVP. if I hated the developers or the game, why the hell would I continue playing the game or purchasing their products? Your argument is dumb. You're basically ranting about the fact that I have an opinion that's contrary to yours. I must be lying because someone is exploiting a bug or hack and you don't like it because you are a fanboy. Cool stuff 
---
ditto.  last night.  no idea what i did, but i was wanted.  stripped of all my armor and clothes and ran around shooting people.  lol.  most just server hopped!!
---
finally, as i was just sitting at 1 of my WS, some low level comes along and finally removes the wanted status.
---
I had an institute rifle with knee cap perk- it was weak but it worked gloriously! 
---
Ooooooh good question. That would move the strategy up from being a pointless dick to being a dick with a point. A pointed dick, if you will. 
---
Yeah.
---
They could also just be misinformed, I guess.
---
You can always grab a gamma gun an refill the horde health whilst they do the dirty work 👍
---
I doubt they will. Hold onto the one you got.  
---
Just throwing a plug in here for rcayton1, he hooked me up with the remaining mutation serums I still wanted when I felt like I had rolled the dice enough times aquiring them through rad poisoning, thx again, and nice camp setup as wel btw. 👍
---
What perks are you using with it? I still have my TSE but I'm only getting 20 higher damage than a non TSE with 5 ranks of demolition equipped.
---
I felt some sympathy until you wrote this:   "it explain just how broken this sad little game is". And then saw your other raging comments about Bethesda/76 in your post history. 
---
You don't seem trustworthy at all.
---
Wow I want to fight a 10 foot tall 60 foot long rad roach really badly now!
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah i will discover them again at some point, we did a lot of exploring in the beta so i probably got most then
---
It's The Dragon, a very nice weapon if you find a legendary with good perks
---
The bigger issue with FO4's radio was that it had quite a few songs that were already in FO3 as well. 
---
The label of this game wasen't "griefing included" nor "broken pvp", therefore it constitutes as a broken product.
---
Good work
---
Heh, but it's still a dick.
---
You should start thinking outside box, what exactly reddit account duration has to do with anything?
---
I don't like to spend time and type here. i prefer to play game with friends.
---
Trading in game sucks so avoiding that as much i can.
---
If this is your logical thinking you should try and search profession in RL that doesn't require logical processing.
---
Best regards..
---
&gt;So, what your saying is they are fine as it stands
---
How the fuck could you possibly think that's what I meant?  
---
Do you think it could be sold/trade for a good/hefty amount to a collector?
---
Lol clearly using an alt account to back himself up
---
This is great. Cool to read how other players prefer certain location and why it fits with their build. I play solo too (don't know anyone else who plays) and kinda nervous playing with other humans I don't know. Got any advice for dealing with Scorchbeasts solo? Those MF are really holding me back, and I keep reading about how they shouldn't be taken on without a team.
---
Can always throw on Tesla coil pa chest and let the turrets do the work. As long as coil tags a creature you get xp and loot.
---
Plenty of players still have duped items and a lot of them but they were below the threshold they used to do the sweep. ALL data is visible and they can easily do a quarry to find out how many players weigh over Xlbs easily.   
---
They think you duped or were involved with duping OR picked up a dupers drop. If that's your case, plead with them and be truthful to them about it.   
---
No one here can do anything, your case is with them. 
---
When i read threads like these i like to play detective, and try to spot whos legit and whos not. Its fun.
---
Call bullshit all you want. I looked through your post history as well. You're just a sad troll who goes around insulting people and trying to make them feel bad
---
[Here's one very recent comment where you're making fun of someone who has down syndrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/ar873m/my_cousin_who_has_a_rare_developmental_disorder/eglza2c?utm_source=reddit-android)

[Here's a post you made about jizzing on people](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/aoyprl/jizz/?utm_source=reddit-android):
---
&gt; I've seen what getting jizzed on by a group of people does to a man, it is not pretty. 
---
Very mature of you. Are you enjoying yourself, coming here to troll on me and try to make me look bad because you don't agree with what I have to say, or that I don't like PVP? I love Bethesda and I wouldn't have purchased this game or even continue playing it if I didn't like the game. There are certain aspects that I obviously don't like. But only a sad troll like you would come here and accuse me of making up a story just because you don't like what is being said. 
---
I'm holding onto a tse gatling plasma for this reason
---
I didn't know that you could color the stands with it
---
True the comparison is a bit extreme, and I understand it works " as intended". Claiming a workshop should put you in PVP with anyone IN THE AREA looking to challenge your claim. What advantage is there, besides seeking to take advantage of someone, to pay caps to travel TO THEM to engage. There is no reason besides wanting to kill another player. Now you might say " well if you don't want to PVP, don't take a workshop" which is silly, but okay, let's go with that logic. Now I'm going to essentially have to decline playing in a group with any of my friends if they have a workshop. 
---
" Sorry man, I'd play with you but I don't want to do any PVP. " 
---
It makes absolutely ZERO sense to leave the area you're fighting over to fight someone over that area. The moment the "attacking" player leaves the workshop area or completes the take over, PVP should end.
---
I had the same thing happen to me yesterday. Was playing for a couple hours and all of a sudden I was the only dot on the map.
---
As u/Toxic_Razz has pointed out, they purchased two copies of the game to run two instances so that they could trade their stuff to themselves. There is no way to trade to your own alt (effectively making him/her a mule). You could have a friend hold stuff while you relog and rejoin to transfer to your alt. You do run the risk of losing your stuff though, if you don't know this person well.
---
You are correct that your CAMP as well as Stash box disappears when you log out. Your CAMP and Stash box is effectively tied to the toon you are playing on and cannot be accessed by your alt. If you had a second instance of the game running, you could trade to "yourself" because you are playing two characters simultaneously.
---
You can't leave junk for alts as I think any paper bags will disappear when you log out. (unconfirmed but I don't know how to test this as we can't force the game to connect to the exact same server instance)
---
You can have two xbox's and only have to buy 1 game. I bought the game and it's on my son's xBox and he plays at the same time. 
---
Only one way to find out.  But don’t be like that guy here yesterday that sold his explosive energy weapon for 1300 caps even after being told how irreplaceable they are.   
---
Say, will you take 1,500?  (Couldn’t resist).  
---
Says the family member of a Bethesda employee!
---
I've done it a kinda risky way... log into a world, view the profiles of other people on the world (maybe take a ss of player list) and find someone you can join game off of. Then find some container to dump your shit in and switch characters, join off the profile u found earlier so you're in the same world
---
I've picked up items and I've been given items that were more than likely duped, if that warrants a ban, then so be it, but they're gonna have to ban a WHOLE lot of people considering everyone I have met has at least one duped item. I'll just play something else until the update, I guess. I'm not mad anymore, I'm just disappointed at one, the lack of communication on their part (I didn't receive an email stating I had been banned.), and two, with how they're handling this. However, the email states we will be able to have our accounts reinstated when they patch duping, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much. 
---
&gt;This decision is final, and no further appeals will be considered. 
---
 a reasonable decision, congratulations 
---
Exactly, they also know that they can make more money by charging less (people) more (money) than they can by making everything cheap and selling en masse.
---
Got him lol
---
As if they made many of the perks cards 0 cost everyone would be running builds optimized for damage, ruining the build diversity you claim to like. As it stands you need to iether make your build a survivalist build with weight reductions and QOL stuff or a build designed to do amazing things in combat. Or some personalized hybrid
---
Removing that choice would only hurt build diversity not increase it.
---
You either have to have a friend with an extra character that will hold your extra stuff or give your extra stuff to them temporarily then log out and log back in with your extra character to get it.   
---
OR have two xbox's and do it yourself.   
---
Either way you need to have someone you trust with your stuff or two xboxs.  
---
That is fucking bullshit 
---
Wrong. 
---
I haven't seen anything about being able to follow specific players before, so it's probably not well known? Report it to get it fixed. Even if it's already reported it adds to the importance of its perceived to be more widespread.
---
Also, I don't think somebody is a fanboy because they either don't know about some hacks or don't immediately jump on a bandwagon. There's been so much made-up outrage and controversy about this game that I personally don't believe something until I see proof now. All the faux controversies have created a strange state of hyper-normalisation.
---
Definitely love to see stuff like this, but I was really hoping to see "Unyielding" in the discussion here, since thats what my build is geared toward. Overall though, very interesting to see the specs on the drops!
---
It'd require you to have 2 Xbox's and 2 screens. If you have a digital copy that's all you need to make it work. If you have a physical copy you need another copy of the game.
---
Appalacia truly would've been a fucking amazing Fallout 5. It is easily the most interesting Wasteland in the series
---
Also the radio towers (where you upload supply requisitions) have maps inside them
---
Said thing is I’ve got like 1300 fusion cells for it, can’t drop in my stash 
---
TIL that this isnt already a thing... Im level 90
---
Gonna justify your statement or will this quickly devolve into"your wrong because I say so"
---
I think there is a good hybrid solution to this. Weight reduction perk cards are passive for the stash, but you need to equip them for the player to gain the effects. You could even extend this to perks like "good with salt" to make the "fridge" people want. 
---
It also gives the higher level charcters a little extra grind as a bonus, since, for example, leveling scattershot on a non shotgun character would still give then player a small bonus 
---
They truly are trying to drive away what little fan base/players they have left. Sad really, this game had a lot of potential, but the Clown Club in Austin really F****d this game up. IMO...the only thing that would save this game... would be to turn it over to the modding community... and they can show Bugthesda how it's done!
---
That perk allows you to deal more damage to WORKSHOP area buildings. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions! Been looking for something like this.
---
Fuck that shit I have never duped a item before I dont even know how just because I have good shit 
---
# **You're***
---
But isn’t that a good gun though?
---
You can't tell a fanboy anyting. If Bethesda designs it, they will praise them until the day they die. It's just sad how people think that griefing others is a crucial part of the game and it somehow makes it fun and challenging. It's really dumb. It's how bullies relieve their frustration since they can't go to the playground any longer and torture other kids
---
Nah, the fact the guy cancelled the trade when OP noticed the crazy price on that one item and became hostile is a pretty good sign the player was trying to scam some caps. 
---
Grifters play on psychology and innatention all the time.
---
The training gives you scorched killer receiver plans, which only provide a minor boost to total scorched damage while lowering it against everything else. Prime receiver plans drop from the scorchbeast queen, raise damage, and give a huge damage boost against scorched, but they also use ultracite ammo
---
Yeah, probably if Watoga and Whitesprings don't give you trouble
---
Like what, for example?
---
You went there with 20 friends?
---
Thanks for proving my point.
---
They're some of the best if you get them on the right weapon. I always use an auto grenade launcher on mirelurk kings/queens so I can hop out of the range of their attacks and rain fire from above. I happened to get one with +30% damage against mirelurks. That does more damage against them than a two shot or auto grenade launcher would
---
No why would i get banned? 
---
THey have proof? where? violation? that's not proof, if they had proof they would give it in first mail sent.
---
Try deleting your weapon by accident, lets see if they can recover it if they have inventory tracking... 
---
You call it salty, i call it being annoyed by people that are not using minimum brain function to think outside box, and accepting everything like sheeps.
---
Jesus, you must be triggered right now. Did my comment hurt you? If you wanna make up fake stories, make them believable.
---
How did i make fun of down syndrome people? I just said, you can't tell them apart wich is true, they share the same facial features. As for the Jizz part, are you stupid? You really can't tell it's a copypaste? 
---
Or instead of a "hybrid solution" we could just go with mine because it makes the most sense. 
---
No "most of us" opt to focus on our health if we are off work from an injury. Not sit at a computer desk for 10hours a day 7 days a week adding repetitive stress injury to whatever else we are already dealing with. Also this is a terrible game especially solo so sorry to OP but I honestly feel bad for the guy and hope he gets help.
---
One case they were and one case they weren't. I see it quite a bit so I'll check next time. It seems to happen at the power plant and food processing workshops. 
---
I'm not sure what the time out would be when a player exits a world or game and the shop has all equipment and turrets there before they disappear. 
---
It was a good 20 minutes+ that they weren't even on the map and it was saying I could take it. I went back and all the stuff and turrets were still there. The 2 large turrets along with others said "OWNED" but he workshop was available??? 
---
Maybe it's a glitch but not sure how something can be owned but the shop not taken. 
---
After I took it all resorted to me as the owner. 
---
How about ‘Modern Paintings?’ Does that unlock anyhing at all? I got it as a loot drop, but did not see any new paintings available in my camp.
---
The Resort Paintings gave me a bunch, but I see all these cool 20th century abstract paintings at different sites in the game world, and was really hoping Modern Paintings would unlock them, but it didn’t seem to unlock anything whatsoever.
---
i am not op, but figured i could answer some possible reasons  
---
my offer for an answer on  the tse 10mm, i carry one, i use it in lower level areas like morgantown high school to use up 10mm ammo instead of my primary and secondary ammos. lvl 5 tse will still work wonders in lower level areas.
---
weapons currently (depending on type) cap at lvl 45 or lvl 50.. im 207 and i use a lvl 45 handmade and a lvl 45 lever, lvl 50 shotgun.  
---
pre nerf to tse's my tse combat shotgun would do 1150 dmg a shot, i could 1 hit anything but the queen, if i was solo and no one was around me at whitesprings i could level all the golf clubs ghouls in one shot (if there were people around i would use my tse 10mm so id just tag all the mobs instead of killing em so other players got xp and loot as well) post nerf the same shotgun does 260 dmg a shot and still not fully perked out (not using the side perks like tank killer, suppressor and so on).
---
my experience on scorchbeasts was to crouch scope in use my handmade to get it to land, then switch to shotgun and shoot it in the face, recently though ive put the shotgun on back burner, dropped str up'd per, to go straight rifle vats build.. target wings to get it down with my lever (through vats), then switch to handmade and again shoot it in the face repeatedly. (per nerf, shotgun build i would use handmade until it landed then switch to shotgun).  
---
watoga in the diner at the south end spawns a random recipe, i have found 2 cranberry reslish recipes there, also thee coffee shop near it to the east i think has a recipe spawn on the counter, if its not the recipe you want dont grab it, server hop and check again. 
---
find cover.. shoot her in the face, dodge acid, get high to avoid smaller bugs.. down by watoga station, there is a house west of it with a pond behind it a queen spawns in, 2 kings, and half dozen or so reg ones. id go there jump on roof of house.. take out kings first using angle of roof to dodge attacks, then work on the other mirelurks, then jump in water to wake up queen, run back to house and get on roof.. snipe her in the face until dead, peaking up over the roof to shoot her.. moving back and forth to avoid acid sprays. quarry north east of watoga.. id get in one of the buildings and pot shot her inbetween killing the lil things she spawns.
---
excavator armor for everything you mine instead of getting one ore you get 4 ore, go into mine in excavator armor mine all the lead nodes, you will leave with roughly 200 to 250 lead ore, smelt them down which is x5 can net you 700 to 1200 lead scrap if you have found everything.
---
idk maybe he hates em as much as i do..  
---
westek = legendaries, TON of steel.. always has mutants can be 1-4 legendaries and a boss.. weapons they drop usually scrap for 8 steel (12 steel when using scrapper perk), then add in caps, and gun powder its about one of the best places to farm and then experience wise ya looking 150+ exp a kill.. and it respawns quickly.. kill outside, go in.. clear, fast travel back outside and poof everythings respawned kill outside, zone back in and sometimes ya get lucky and inside repawns..   
---
if youre on ps4 my psn: Silune, hit me up and can drag ya around a bit and help ya experience some of the stuff your having trouble with.
---
I was escorting a level 30 from the Top of the World to the Observatory earlier. Scorchbeast flew from the west over Seneca Rocks, noticed my companion, then blasted me (still hidden) and pretty much immediately killed me... I was at 90% rads for adrenal reaction and a bat was the last thing I was expecting on that road!
---
I live by the train station and have seen scorchbeasts fly south from there. Just not a regular occurrence and it's always non hostile (to me anyway). I wonder if this is the same scorchbeast that appears at Morgantown Airport? It flies towards Seneca Rocks... Interesting.
---
You play 64 hours a week.  The game has been out for just shy of 14 weeks.  That's full work week and a half.  
---
Thanks!    
---
I haven't played in weeks for many reasons. Mostly b/c of Shadow of the Tomb Raider DLC each month and the RE2 remake.  
---
I'll make a note of this and when I get time I might start playing again. I'm on PC
---
64 hours a week
---
No I meant when you get off of work normally then I'm sure we all play games unless we have something else planned. Besides, spending this much time isn't much different than grinding thousands of hours on something like Skyrim. It's just as unhealthy but people do it
---
I use the charged barrel mod, which does decrease dmg by a lot, but at least makes it last around 1500-2000 shots.
---
I have an instigating gatling gun which literally does twice the dmg, but I just love the feel of the laser more. 
---
Looks like it says 'this is unlocked elsewhere. Trying to post a photo...
---
You know what would fix this? A Protest Sign that says “KILL ME”.
---
You get an email yet?
---
Then why hang around this sub? 
---
I wish I could help you, but I don't know where to get plans for any version of any raider armor pieces. So...maybe you can help me? :)
---
exactly, I'm disappointed too, and I discovered all this because I was the one to ask. What would have happened if I had been a casual player who does not mind too much of this kind of problem? I would have been stuck on login without communications? I've been a big fan of this game even after seeing all my social tab empty, but now I do not really have any more excuses for this behavior 
---
When you switch servers are you completely closing 76 and reopening it or are you just quitting to main menu and pressing play again? They made it so that you have to completely close the game if you want to server hop. 
---
They are seriously gonna fucking ban people for being to good at the game like un fucking believable it's not our fault they made a faulty game and i can guarantee I got banned cause I missed off a 30 year old baby who cried when I shot his base he probably reported ne but what the fuck is the purpose of being able to damage someone's base if its prohibited Bethesda is a bunch of fuck bags no one wonder fallout 76 is going no where 
---
Oh definitely. Regardless of intent, the individual in question is being a dick on some level.
---
Stash goes up Tuesday!
---
No. I have my camp near a workshop. Sometimes while defending it, the hordes will aggro on my camp instead of me. If my turrets take them out without me tagging them they don't drop anything.
---
Yea but at least Skyrim has enough content to kind of warrant that amount of hours and most people put in that many hours over the space of years not months. Doing it in such a short time is incredibly unhealthy.
---
It's just a bit sad to see people bragging about spending so many hours of their life sitting in front of a screen and then all these clearly 14 year olds that think it is cool and respect worthy to so such a thing.
---
Everything has it's limits. Even exercising for 10hours a day 7 days a week would kind of be bad for you. Sitting playing games for that amount of time is downright terrible no matter what the situation.
---
Did you block them ? Did the people you were playing with block them? Ain’t nobody using stalker cheats. You just don’t know what you’re doing to prevent trolling.
---
Hot key food items keeps you from having to go onto your menu to eat or drink. I try to limit how often I'm in the pipboy to as little as possible 
---
I had a similar experience last night, but instead of taking workshops (I was seriously considering trying to take all of them) I decided to launch all three missile silos one after another. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to kill SBQ solo. I hope this is a "bug/feature" introduced with the latest server stability fixes and that it keeps doing it, because it was a ton of fun to know that the whole world was mine to do with as I pleased.
---
I may have missed something but why would you need a different weapon for a specific enemy type? Its pretty easy to one shot enemies anyway
---
Yes, because I never posted anything on this new account, I must be lying. I never use reddit, because of the community, but I felt like I had to because of this obvious mistake Bethesda made. Enjoying talking more crap
---
I wouldn't mind the workshop issue if people haven't learned to use it as a griefing mechanism.
---
Assholes have learned if they just initiate it and don't actually take it, it causes the owner to enter PVP.  So they will start to take it, find you on the map, and kill you before you have the opportunity to react.
---
Even better is that it will extend to teams, so they just send teammates to your location to find you first, then initiate it, then the teammates immediately kill you.
---
The way it ***SHOULD*** work is that if the aggressor leaves the green circle that appears when taking the workshop, the entire thing is null and void.  It should not extend to teammates *at all* unless they are also within that radius.
---
Every server I go on now, all workshops are open because everybody has learned that if you take them, you deal with griefers.
---
A damage boost certainly won't hurt.  I have a quad combat shotgun (32 clip!) so whenever she landed, I just went under her belly and blasted away.  I have 2300 ultracite shotgun shells that a much higher level player gave to me, I'd love to be able to use them.
---
Also during the event I walked backwards into a green pit and died!  I died again trying to get my loot out from halfway down the wall, but I managed to get it the second time without falling in.  I'll be more careful to watch where I'm going next time! :D
---
You'll often encounter level 68 super mutants in the Divide. Don't underestimate them, especially prior to level 50. They can be very resilient without good perks, weapons and chems. They still get me on occasions. At the Top of the World in particular you can be completely swarmed, as people visiting the train station trigger respawns. 
---
And if you added the adrenal perk. Omg dmg lol
---
God rest your soul
---
We're supposed to use wanted status to punish these wanted murderers. Lol... 
---
This is really great, thanks for all the info. 
---
The only people I see imploding are the folks who are claiming ignorance that this game had PVP from day 1. You signed on for this when you paid for the game that had PVP elements in it.
---
Being ignorant of the fact that claiming a workshop puts you in PVP is not Bethesda's fault, it's yours. 
---
Being ignorant of the fact that Pacifist mode means you cannot harm others, but they can harm you if they are not on pacifist mode is not Bethesda's fault, it's yours. Pacifist mode has its uses (like preventing Friendly Fire). It is not a "Get Out of PVP Free" card. 
---
Constantly getting killed by going back and trying to get revenge on your attackers is not Bethesda's fault. Its yours.
---
Not blocking Griefers and hopping to a new server is not Bethesda's fault, it's yours.
---
Stop trying to place blame on everyone else but the person who deserves it, yourself 
---
Probably an enemy, not another player. Enemies sometimes bug out and cannot be seen or targeted, leading to them just being able to freely attack you. Sometimes melee will kill these enemies, sometimes not.
---
There is mechanics to avoid it. Block for session ---&gt; server hop. People complaining about getting killed over and over again until they loose all their caps are just doing to themselves. 
---
Brilliant! Can we see your camp?
---
I tried it a bit today and it feels like it lasts a lot longer now then it used to, gunsmith 5 + luck of the draw on.  It still doesn't last as long or do as much dmg as my normal gatling gun but it seemed like it was more usable.
---
Can you imagine the tragedy? They think they are getting easy xp, but strangers keep wrecking their camps for "no reason" in their minds. They don't understand that their strategy keeps EVERYONE from getting anything. It's downright Shakespearian.
---
Always shaken not stired
---
Lucky you, that happened to me once and my character "tripped" into a fissure. I tried getting my stuff back but it was on the bottom so I couldn't even get it before I died. I ended up losing pretty much everything I had at the time, including some stabilized flux
---
Did they say officially Tuesday? I might have missed it. Just asking for assurance. And if so, I'm guessing 9am like the others have been?
---
yes, since its not a problem with damage. the charging is.
---
from what i read its not as i initially described, it crashes when an enemy melees you while you are charging.
---
Yes, I've done this, but, at least on the PS4, when I press the direction button that bring up the favorites wheel, it sometimes doesn't trigger, or it lags. If I'm in a fight, it's also hard, for me anyway, to scroll the wheel to the item I want. Basically, if I'm in combat, I'm boned.
---
And you get atoms from the most random shit. "Jumped 10/10 times!, heres 10 atoms!"
---
Yes.
---
Happy hunting!
---
The quick wheel is a mess anyways. But its better then going into the pipboy. I have wasted so many rad always trying to switch to a different weapon lol
---
Yep! Bloodied, anti armor and executioner's are all good primary effects, and just about any melee with +40% swing speed is awesomeness! 
---
How do you even play the game with only 5 intelligence?!?!?
---
i think so. they fixed one of the damage issues, yes, but not all of them.
---
sneak attacks for example are still broken.
---
also the charged barrels still cause the crash to desktop when an enemy melees you while charging it
---
That actually makes it more suspicious:
---
* Your original post in this thread doesn't even mention that you know him. 
---
* As soon as someone says to take it with a grain of salt, now you chime in that you can vouch for him that this happened. (Basically "Blood is thicker than water" argument fallacy)
---
* As well you now are saying you know MORE people who just happened to be banned. 
---
Those two posts in a row are tell-tale signs of people who are just trying to stir the pot. 
---
Assuming the ban actually happened, it wouldn't be surprised you had one friend who duped and then passed off items to the others, basically profiting from the exploit without performing it themselves.  
---
I don't think this actually happened though, to be honest, your post actually makes it LESS authentic looking as a post. 
---
Glad to see others having a good time. Make those ghouls your bitch homie lol
---
It doesn't work at all. If you kill someone half the time no wanted. If you destroy someone's entire base, 30 caps the fuck??? 30 caps for destroying a fusion generator is so silly. Make it 1000 or force pacifist mode 
---
And it happened after the queen was killed, I had about a dozen hardened mass in there.
---
Love this. I had a moment at Whitesprings the other day quite similar. I'm like 68 and I met a level 29. Saved his ass from a gang of charred and got a thumbs up so I asked him if he needed anything and dropped him like 15 stim's. He must of been trying to get his mic on to speak back but in the background a level 91 glowing deathclaw was heading straight for us so i shouted "watch your back!" he turned round just as his mic came on and I heard the girliest scream. I was pissing my self. If that wasn't enough, another level 91 glowing deathclaw then headed for us again and the same reaction ensued. Good times
---
I started as a rifleman also, but I have had alot more fun branching out as a jack of all trades kind of instead of specializing. I have shotgun perks for combat shotgun, slugger perks for all rise super sledge and rifle perks for my handmade rifle (used to use hunting then lever but I really like handmade since I found an explosive one) I may not be godly with any one type but I'm pretty good with a few different weapon types and its way more enjoyable. 
---
Shhh! What are you doing?? You’re not allowed to *like* Fallout 76 so openly!  ;)
---
They said “next week.”   I am assuming Tuesday.  
---
You don't play this game, so why do you care.
---
Nope. I do have the chameleon mutation however I wear armor when it happens.
---
Besides there is no 'shimmer'.
---
I know right? Wanted status is a complete joke
---
I remember from destiny 2 you could change time &amp; year to farm a specific strike solo. Anyone smarter than me know if it would be possible in fo76??
---
Yeah I keep stacking atoms because they are easy to earn
---
Paper bag persists as long as another player remains nearby. Friend is ideal, but you can use “recent” in social to rejoin the same server.
---
I see you don't understand how bans work. They don't need to show proof to anyone. They are the ones banning, they have the proof they need.
---
I'm sorry that you are so triggered about this, though.
---
I'm wondering if it is possible you could inquire what items do you obtain that would stack up to be 100,000. You say one thing and they say otherwise. If they have the "data" surely there is no harm is sharing if you collected 100,000 steel over 30 days or 100,000 Halloween Candy.
---
Does anyone know if Graham always carried the Treated and Resistant Casual Plans or if that’s new after patch 5.  
---
My grand idea was to get 2-3 alts learned up with the treated/resistant in casual and the 1st 3 tier of raider and run them through all the quests hoping to score.  Funny thing is it worked with the Shielded Raider even though that toon didn’t know the protective plan (btw...where does one find protective raider plans these days?  Since the patch, at least on my under lvl 15 toons, the train station vendors only have the first two) but since the patch didn’t mention any changes that seemed to affect the likely bugged quest I haven’t pursued it further.
---
I found the 1st 2 Casual Plans on Graham by way of a fluke when I happened upon him on an alt...made me wonder if he was the keeper of all casual plans these days but if he is the 3rd tier is lvl locked above 11, and below 180.
---
LOL
---
Sucks you're getting downvoted. You're 100% right. OP is just trying to start a circlejerk.
---
Just wait until you too are a high level, and learn that the only reason so many of us seem generous is because we just picked up way too much junk. 
---
Nada.
---
All i'm saying that ppl should not auto accept things as granted when someone posts about being unjustly banned, and that is what is happening.
---
Banned = guilty.
---
Bethesda support is more than flawed in this game, they are changing their side of story from week to week, and when they ban someone it's without any direct explanation why , just violation , and everyone accepting it?
---
I really wish that ppl posting find themself in same situation, being unjustly banned, and receive as much support and understanding as Rob.
---
Won't reply anymore because reddit is just bunch of crap with ppl licking eachoter for stupid karma like it actually means that someone is right or wrong.
---
Just wish ppl start to use brain to think and question, because with this state we have on reddit we are entering idiocracy as society.
---
Best regards.
---
It is the 
---
Hey so was mine, but when I went in see why mods I had for it, you can swap it for generic launch and it will set the damage at 400+. I just did this to mine last night. 
---
Thanks for the advice. 
---
My 2 other friends having same problem 
---
I’m having the same problem.  I have died 4 times in 2 days. Each time I was unaware until I was dead then I would reload and they would have 5-10 cap bounty. Really annoying at higher levels lost 700 caps due to it. I guess I could remove and  buy the mutations I need excluding electricity changed, unstable isotope. I thought it was my internet lagging. 
---
What if you enjoy hunting down cats and butchering them, and not eat the meat?
---
In Watoga
---
Oops. Uh, hear hear!
---
There’s a map in the Chinese bunker under mama dolces too
---
Increase the special points to 60 
---
and make the  repair /crafting/hacking perks passive
---
Then you go to the bad place lol
---
I must have one of these.   I know everyone loves the All Rise but I’m in love with my ski sword. 
---
So, should I put going there off a little more, or just charge in?
---
If I honestly cared about downvoting...  
---
Just means people don't like being told they are ignorant.
---
Bullshit.
---
I'm not defending their design decision. I'm mocking anyone who thinks that buying the game either *knowing* that design decision or *being ignorant to* that design decision. Should have just not bought the game. Todd Howard is literally on record pre-release saying that they want it to be a game where if someone wants to kill you they can and there is nothing the game will provide you to stop them doing it.
---
😂👍
---
That's a really good build damn. But how do you have 4 charisma in a 3 perk card- lone wanderer? Is that a glitch on the page or am I missing something?
---
Same.
---
Hold out for one with strength and swing speed. For the main ability, mutant's, anti-armor, furious, or executioner's.
---
not everyone plays the game for the same reasons, there is alot more to this game than just the storyline, i was lvl 60 ish before i even really started on the story lines.. some people like to farm gear looking for that perfect piece for that part of their build. i know tons of players just here to build things like they did in fallout 4 but now they have friends that they can show their new designs to.. 
---
im 207 and i havent even gotten every map marker yet, infact found a new location last night going to a new friends house and looking down the cliff with my rifle, said oh whats that and took off down there. found 3 couple nights ago because i decided to walk to watoga from my house instead of fast traveling, only took 2 hours..
---
some people are collectors, need every outfit, every costume, every power armor, every power armor in every paint option.   
---
this is not like the typical call of duty type game, jump in rush through story line, woohoo games beat day later.. now on to next game.  
---
i can spend hours in the game just randomly wandering around shooting whatever i come across, and not be bored in the slightest.
---
RemindMe! 2 hours
---
I got the Twisted Muscles recipe and can make the serum if needed. 500 caps- PM me
---
Hey did you forget about me?
---
I’ve never seen it either. Since the game first came out.  I agree. Very frustrating.

Trading is safe.  Your fears are unwarranted.  
---
I think you impact balance too much if you just give those cards out for free vs forcing to equip them. 
---
I know in my build i would love to drop Traveling Pharmacy/Thru-Hiker for more damage perks, but there needs to be some cost to carrying a ton of stimpacks/radaways, and enough food to keep the well-fed bonus constantly up. 
---
The thing that bothers me is that i have to add all of my food/aid on my character if i'm running low on stash space, and that seems a little ridiculous.
---
Not from WV but i second this. Always up for new content.
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Slightly above average on Raider, almost exactly average on limbs it looks like.  
---
Reason I want to find an empty server that has WS nuked is so I can do 3 - 5 hours with my 3 accounts and track exactly the same way, the clustering seems to occur more in one location
---
I foubd mine as a mod in the bunker. It's very low like 1% chance.
---
Somehow I hadn’t read about those ‘claws before fumbling around Whitesprings for almost the first time yesterday, so unexpected I understand the shrieks of terror!
---
How do you break this habit lol?
---
Yeah, from what I've found I don't think all of Appalachia was directly nuked. It's mostly just side affects of the fallout. So not everyone was killed by the bombing itself. They just ended up dying to the scorched because none of the factions were equipped to handle it on their own, and they all refused to work together.
---
Love bees, love the idea.
---
i absolutely love those times when that happens to me, sadly its usually 1 or 2 am and i only have an hour or two left to play. but just the whole world being empty and everything can be mine, is pretty amazing feeling.
---
I have my Alt character camp in the same area as my main character. I choose a spot near some sort of container  where there isn't a lot of foot traffic. (Southeast of Flatwoods there is a truck with an explosives box next to it that I have used a couple times)
---
Then I will find someone on my friends list who is currently online and join their world. I travel over to them and check to make sure they will be playing for the next half hour or so. 
---
If they are, I head to my camp, and put the things I want to transfer to the other character into the container. Log out, switch characters, go to the social menu, and join the world again through the friend. Then I retrieve the items from the container. 
---
So far I haven't had any issues with other players stumbling on my stuff or not being able to rejoin the friend. I don't move a lot of stuff, just items character 1 picks up that character 2 would like. 
---
YESSSSSSS just a little dot next to ones not read yet would be perf
---
I like this idea. Maybe some carry weight cards give you bonus damage on let's say, heavy guns/shotguns/energy weapons? Idk I like the hybrid idea 
---
thanks for the great tips in your reply. I’m on Xbox though. Thanks again.
---
Yes I think this would be a great change!
---
Got one of them from actually dismantling a peice of armor funny enough didn't think it was possible. I have video proof as eell for those that will try and tell me I am wrong.
---
loooooooool
---
I take over workshops with low level mules that have no caps and no junk.
---
My camps are foundation cubes that you can only enter by fast travel.
---
I set things up on my playing session in such fashion that ALT+F4 at a moment's notice is just a mild inconvenience, in fact server disconnects are often more frustrating. 
---
I cannot stop PvP, is part of the game, but I can make sure that is as unengaging and bland as it can possibly be.
---
They get the loot
---
I found the BOS chest plans yesterday.
---
Idk I think this could be a lil too much power 
---
In the Train car in watoga close to the Train station I found the arms
---
I bought both of mine down there you have to server hop a million times just to get 1. Also x01 target hud is also very rare
---
Honestly I want this to be my Whitespring Nuke Bloated Ghoul Killer.  Thinking swing speed + Furious would be ideal.  ??
---
I did. Then I rebuilt it because placement was off. Then I realized the trees on the edge totally ruin the effect, so I’m abandoning my junk node and looking for a new, obstruction free area that unfortunately means no resources at my camp. But it’s going to look damn cool, lol. 
---
Broken game is broken
---
Just re watched the clip I dismantled some random combat arms I found and got bos limbs.
---
Fuck pay to win, keep that shit far away from this great game
---
Yes you get loot from turret kills but not XP. I also always destroy these camps as well.
---
Interesting I hit that care several times a day and only find marine stuff or BOS UA 
---
I've never seen any X-01 mod plans, just the mods themselves.
---
near the monorail elevator 
---
It was specifically for the PA stand.
---
Depending on privacy settings you can just pull up a persons gamer tag and as long as they’re in a public match (all 76 games are public) then you can join
---
Oh you could also get for the armor ok thanks
---
It isn’t “bugged.”  It is a 1% drop rate.  So hit the store 200 times or head on over the the f76 marketplace.   
---
I found two in 45 minutes.
---
I'm really impressed with it's performance, especially when compared to fo4.
---
The ability to destroy someone’s CAMP or attack another player is an intended feature. 
---
“You’ll decide the heroes, and you’ll decide the villains.”
---
“You can choose whether or not to interact, help or hinder each other. “
---
How are they using the mechanic wrong? Yes it sucks for him that they found his CAMP and destroyed it. But it’s not difficult to repair. 
---
I found the chest plan in the military star chest at the cutthroat camp near pleasant valley train station
---
&gt; All i'm saying that ppl should not auto accept things as granted when someone posts about being unjustly banned, and that is what is happening.
---
It happens in every game that hands out bans. Every ban wave there is a flood of posts claiming to have never done the things they were banned for. And funnily enough, they are almost always people who have never contributed to the community prior to the allegations of false bans. 
---
Wow you guys are on the ball tyvm...lawd knows I’ve been looking (g’morning 
---
I'm going to screenshot the tip of saving the post so that I can remember to save posts later
---
I have 600 hours in and have never gotten one.  I had a couple of two shot guns that used to be decent but after the nerf were worthless so I sold them to the vendors.  I also have a couple of explosive ones.  The shotgun is still usable but I have a rifle build and the explosive assault rifle that used to be usable isn’t any better than a higher level regular assault rifle now.  Part of the issue is it seems like yours they are always lower level even though they are dropping for high level players from high level legendaries.
---
And the leg plan I bought off of another player
---
Yeah coding doesn't get shit like that wrong. You obviously duped items. In game code ( If item =&lt;15000 then flag_for_review;)
---
It's a simple code implemented in almost all online games so people like you that all of a sudden get over a certain number of rare items gets flagged. You got caught sucks for you.
---
I feel your pain, my first 2SE was a lvl 35 black powder rifle with 15% faster reload. it dropped 3 hours before they nerfed it..... 1200 damg to 400
---
worst part I didnt even get to fire a shot before the nerf 😢
---
I got banned
---
Pvp or help low lvls
---
I still  enjoy the game., that's the most important. Do you recommend a other game in the same categorie?
---
And all I'm saying is that after 22+ years of MMOs, odds are if someone was banned, it wasn't "for no reason".  
---
You want people to think and question, but you want people to just blindly believe the story of someone who says they got banned for no reason.  Pick one. 
---
I’m up around level 65 and had a workshop taken over by a higher level team.  Hostile was up around 150 and their covert teammate at 90.  After getting 86’d a second time while trying to retrieve my loot, I decided to just bide my time for a lil bit. I’m a stealth sniper/melee build, and picked a location at a distance where I could safely observe the workshop.  Eventually the level 90 in chameleon armor comes ambling close to my hidey shrub, but never spots me.  Two quick rounds of “Powerfist Punchies” and I have my sweet revenge.
---
There's what? 70 - 100 Atoms a day you can get from daily missions, and 200 - 400 a week from weekly missions. That's 690 on the low end and 1100 a week on the high end. That's a power armor skin every 2 weeks. That's not too bad. 
---
Same thing happened to me. Said I have over A MILLION of a rare item which is simply not true
---
You can get the plans to create them
---
 Plan is: Road Leathers
---
I found it once
---
 I got one not that long ago. Now the fucking Jet Pack I have not seen.
---
Cool I’ll check it out
---
Yeah but still enough to get impulse buys. Playing 14 days to get a power armor skin is not exactly convenient to a lot of people 
---
Yeah, I skipped on the PA paint itself - I like the X-01 in plain steel, and there's no other paints for the Excavator.
---
Cool...came back and re-reread what you just said thinking you might have unlocked BOS helm paint but nope...Jager was specific!! 
---
It ain't broken, you got no luck. I got 2 chars with jetpack and 2x calibrated shocks 
---
Dicks of level 25, 50 and 100 get trophies.
---
And someone told me that it does not tag the loot, so they are pointless dicks.
---
Maybe I was just completely dumb but... it was a bit before I realized some of them have more detailed specifics. Like for example there was one I remember about taking photos around Vault 76. I kept taking them and was getting irritated I wasn’t getting credit. I then realized the details of the challenge specified something about what to wear or some such. 
---
He provided helpful input with this write-up..and this is how u add to the thread?
---
I want recipes 
---
&gt;says west tek is first place you visit on any login
---
&gt;has whitesprings as first place on "normal route"
---
&gt;2019
---
ishygddt
---
Putting this one case aside, if youre new to the game, is server hoping you should be aware of? I would think not.  I dont think low level people who play casually would be aware of server hoping as a option. Server hoping shouldnt be considered a real "option" .  Server hoping is a technical loop hole to bypass some game mechanics.
---
Pacifists mode shouldnt be enabled by defaut. The fact that I, when was a new player, only knew about the pacifists mode through read about in reddit.
---
Suppose that Alice and Bob each do damage to my camp. Alice hits my decontamination shower repeatedly until it has a sliver of health left. Bob sees this happening and tries to stop Alice, but tags my decontamination shower for that final sliver of health. Who should come out of that situation with a bounty?
---
Suppose that Bob kills me to allow his buddy Alice to take my junk. Who should get the bounty there? What if Bob kills me and tries to protect my bag, but Alice gets it, somehow, anyway? What if Bob abandons my bag and Alice wanders over, unaware of what has transpired, and takes the loot?
---
I farm the deathclaw there..defeat..collect loot..server hop til I get them again
---
Not the road leathers the shielded under armor plan to mod raider clothing such as road leathers 
---
5 republics... 200 years. I get it, you gotta give the people what they want. In this case i dont think the people know what they want.
---
I’ve done this with a friend online but not as others have described. The friend doesn’t have to hold my items, just guard the bag of stuff I’ve dropped until I logout and back in and join them with my alt.
---
That sucks. I accidentally learns it
---
Nah it’s not a crutch, just preferred it. Now I’m taking your caps with melee. 🤣. What’s your GT? I’ll take your caps also. ❤️
---
So explosive weapons like TSE get affected by the explosive perk cards? 
---
Lol yes I wish I could buy it 
---
To expensive this is fallout I just rob you 
---
Try it.
---
I got one yesterday on XB1. 
---
Bethesda has created a communist society. What's your gamertag. I'll demonstrate if you feel cocky enough sir. It only takes one report ticket and you're account will be removed until they feel fit to return it. So I'm glad you opened your mouth on the subject too. Anyone is able to report anyone else falsely and still have the reported account deleted whether or not they did anything wrong. Get ur facts straight and do some research if u think its bullshit.
---
Quantity of individual items shouldn’t have any more server load than a single item
---
Eg Steel 100
---
vs
---
Steel 10000
---
Honestly if they just made fully scrapped junk weightless in stash that ~600~ or 800 stash would go a very long way
---
Yea I’d like that...would be nice to have around for crafting and scrapping 
---
Turning on and off your system wont fix in game bugs. Bugs come from coding not how much ram your system has. Your spreading false information.
---
Did u ever go to the whitespring resort lol
---
Congrats bruh..this is a cool unique TSE as well
---
Glad you're having fun!
---
This could be another great solution to the weight issue on my opinion :) 
---
Did anyone else think at first she was singing "oh man he kicked the bucket oh man fuck fuck fuck it"?
---
That was probably the BoS helmet paint.
---
It's the coolest new thing. Freedom of speech. Try recognizing other people's from time to time, smart ass.
---
Cranberry bog is the worst..I was telling someone yesterday I'm done with that area lolol
---
Pretty sure she says it once lol.
---
It took me 2 days comprised of 3 hour stretches of server hopping while watching Rogan on the second screen to get two calibrated shocks and a jetpack.
---
In what universe does this spell fun bethesda? Eliminate the need for server hopping. Borrow a page from D3 reaper of souls for some ideas on what to do about earning high level stuff via the end game. Id LOVE something akin to d3s greater rifts that give rewards such as calibrated shocks. The better the reward loot pool the higher the rift.
---
This would create an awesome high level theorycraft-centric gameplay loop that will give us an actual reason to min max our builds with all the new high level stuff we find.
---
As it stands, server hopping for high level rare stuff is little more than standing in front of a slot machine, pumping the arm over and over. 
---
Thats whack son.
---
You can always ask another player to mod your weapon for you
---
Yes, not that they need to be.
---
lol at work thanks for the laugh.. op and this post has me rolling..
---
Are you going to block everyone on the entire server? If you think you can, then that's just silly. It would be a single player game at that rate 
---
Yeah, she does sound a bit native american now that i think of it
---
Instigating 
---
No, because the stash was big enough with 400 weight.
---
Stop being a fucking hoarder and go enjoy the game.  You do not need 50 backup everythings.
---
Yes I know a few players but on this build I've unlocked almost all of the gunsmith perks..so I wanna mod some guns
---
Could you please upload the clip? Maybe it will give me back hope. I scrapped so many pieces and looked at so many plan spots, but I've only found the chest plan. Thanks
---
oh god yall killed me, at work and you and the guy about the deathclaws have me goin.. getting strange looks from the customers.. these were great. lol
---
I have t zeesn any plans for any raider armor at all. I'm still using pieces I've found in the wastes
---
Order is random. Last one is always the toughest to learn though. I think it takes 20 scraps on average for most rifles, but can be much more if you're unlucky. For armor it's more like 200.
---
Rad worms has some bugs currently. Not intended. :)
---
Sounds like you're the one trying to start a circlejerk. 
---
"IDK why you're getting downvoted I agree with you that's all that matters" ok dude 
---
Its kwanzaa 
---
#2 on your how to fix is horrible. Also, Wanted is just a representation of how big your crimes are, not how many caps you have... Yes it sucks not to get a payout, but it would not be in the fallout spirit to have all these limiting factors. Raiders in fallout 4 didn't have to follow all the rules you outlined, and they couldn't pay crap for their bounties... Except the legendary raiders.
---
Wow you're fun :^)
---
Before the patch I server hopped Grafton 340 times (yes 340 not a typo) to get all 3 BoS plans. When the last patch hit I deleted my character in a fit of rage. Guess I shouldn't have done that lol. Nowhere to get BoS plans now? We wait and hope they fix it (little hope).
---
I'll try its a pain for me if your xbox i can just send it your way I may be wrong as I didn't know thats how ya got the bos paint for the helm. Otherwise it'll be a few before I can upload it :)
---
This is my point exactly. If you change your configuration and it goes away, then there is a chance that your configuration is there problem.
---
How much?
---
Great write-up, thank you. 
---
I kno the areas in which the enemies drop these guns..so at the same time..I will be getting junk, caps, and xp which is cool..but I literally keep scrapping with no other mods being learned 
---
So you're telling me thousands of people could fix a in game code issue by hard resetting your system.....please take some computer courses.
---
I submitted a ticket and they told me to check my internet connection. Then they replied and told me I was perm banned for having over a million of a rare item which is not true.. Best of luck mate
---
Ok tell me ur ign and lets see if u get banned again
---
" I found both the BOS torso and legs in the cranberry bog- one in the trainyard east of watoga, the other in the glassed cavern. "
---
BoS armor or plans? Since the patch?
---
Seriously man, it's my highlight of the game since day one of the beta!
---
Says 20. So not much but pleaseee lol
---
Once a server has a certain amount of up time, it will not direct new players to it. So, if you can wait it out, you could have a server to yourself every day of the week if you wanted.
---
Do you have a cowboy black hat ?
---
Is shadowed just shadowed it is it BOS shadowed..I love that effect..especially in fo4
---
Unless it’s made of concrete foundations like mine with sirens in it , then good luck!! :)
---
&gt;The only people I see imploding are the folks who are claiming ignorance that this game had PVP from day 1. You signed on for this when you paid for the game that had PVP elements in it.
---
The beta was incredibly short, and hardly gave a clear indication of what the game would actually be like. Everyone was fixated on the bugs, so much so that PVP rarely happened. 
---
&gt;Being ignorant of the fact that claiming a workshop puts you in PVP is not Bethesda's fault, it's yours. 
---
Someone can initiate the workshop and not even take it. They track you down and kill you. That's an exploit
---
&gt;Being ignorant of the fact that Pacifist mode means you cannot harm others, but they can harm you if they are not on pacifist mode is not Bethesda's fault, it's yours. Pacifist mode has its uses (like preventing Friendly Fire). It is not a "Get Out of PVP Free" card. 
---
I like most other players are well aware of the silly pacifist mode. It's fucking lame and no one save for you and three others actually likes it. That's why people are begging for PvP servers to get rid of you annoying scrubs
---
It really should hide wanted people as well. There's no good reason it shouldn't.
---
Daisy cutter is a MIRV
---
Would love to see you actually be able to apply the mod. I got the BOS Combat Legs unlocked notification but I am not able to actually apply the mod to any type of combat legs.
---
It's actually doing 400+×6 damage
---
Yeah dont waste your time on ultricite unless you are endgame and farm lots of flux to keep up with ammo supply. Prime plans are random and you could get ammo before a reciever. Ammo is stupid expensive
---
They don't get any exp from this.
---
New characters are fun..you will not make the mistakes that u made with ur previous character..the first thing I did was make sure I went to whitespring harpers and watoga so I can fast travel there..I usually train my alts at summersville
---
Wow. You must be a little kid. I'm not entertaining you're idiot request because you clearly can't read and I've already been banned and can't be banned twice, moron.
---
Do u remember where u got the black diamond? My main character has it but I want mine for my alt..literally one of my favorite weapons in the game
---
They dont? 
---
Oof. How can that be avoided?
---
Sugar Grove is the best spring farm in the game. Worth mentioning.
---
You have to re-craft the gun to make the level increase. Unfortunately this means you need the plan to make the gun and you need to re-make all your mods, but this will increase the stats of the gun and is often worth it in my experience.
---
I saw a few posts like this today and wanted to share what I found... looks like a lot of people asking on Twitter to Bethesda and they say the same thing...  
---
[https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/with_replies)
---
Miniton
---
Gotta remember that - next time I’ll use ALT-F4 too!
---
I do not. What area/quests does it drop from? I can keep an eye out. 
---
there been a time or two id been in whitesprings during a nuke run (sniper build, sittin up on a wall or roof, because well obi wan taught me high ground wins) and see someone come sprinting past.. few seconds later dozen or so glowing ones sprinting after him gets me to chuckle.. but never have i heard someone screaming as they run by.. that would prolly kill me.. i would have absolutely loved to have witnessed that scream first hand.. 
---
I barely ever comment on Reddit, but you deserve this:  
---
I don't care if this comment of yours is two months old, he's simply asking what to do after there's not much else left.  
---
Since your first response to him is so negative and defending of a game that indeed has way too many bugs and far too few things to do (Especially after the main questline) even though it's a triple A title, I bet you're just saying all that because you cannot stand criticism let alone a question as he didn't even say anything should be changed, so there's not even any criticism yet.  
---
TL;DR: The game that could be, but isn't. yet you're defending it, in a very dickish way.
---
I always wondered why I saw “diseased” eyebots 
---
🤔
---
Nope.  They have to tag each ghoul for xp
---
Nope , no xp, but they can still collect the loot from the bodies or piles. They are also stealing from players trying to farm there
---
So why do they set up camps there. 
---
This is one of many reasons why I uninstalled till they decide to release the servers.
---
I can imagine how much better that would have felt with some of the better Fallout 4 mods added in too.
---
Im with you as long as they dont have turrets i will kill them
---
Amen. I quit because duped weapons are the new normal and Bethesda won't take them away. Good 3 star weapons shouldn't be standard equipment for 75% of the current player base. I'll play again  when duped weapons are really deleted from everyone's account. Until then this game is not fun or rewarding for honest players.
---
Why?
---
Their support team did message me back both times within like 8 hours
---
I did it relatively low by building my C.A.M.P. by Tyler County Fairgrounds and completing the Horde event that spawns there every 15-20 mins and got the last two at Fort Defiance while doing the Line in the Sand quest before farming for Asylum gear 
---
Put in ts tkt im not banned but they cant fix so put in ats tkt says will get email, but dount they work weekends
---
it was a joke I asked because u live in the area
---
There is certainly some kid of weird seeding going on with Drops and Legendary spawns.
---
I'll spare the anecdotal details, but there are a few specific spawn locations that if a 2\* or 3\* spawns for me, it drops generally the same type of item with the same legendary prefix.
---
I might play today but next weekend if you’re still doing it HMU PS4-JARRRRIO
---
Agreed.  I've been there as well.  Cool little town.  I need more masks.
---
Exactly what I suggested for a workshop fix - leave the circle during capture and you lose PvP unless the owner has shot you back.
---
Oh it’s not called whitesprings resort irl it’s called the Greenbrier and is located in White Sulfur Springs. I’ve been there but never stayed there because it’s extremely expensive. It’s super nice, though
---
Doubt advanced tech support works weekends 
---
I’ve been to one that was “working”, the dude was waiting for player like me to spawn in, which respawns the ghouls, and then he ran around throwing Molotov’s on everything and then let me and his turrets finish everything off.  Afterwards he just went around and collected everything waiting for the next person.  
---
I’ve never seen anyone else do it “right” like this, it’s always just been turrets as close to the windows as possible and nobody around.    
---
Thx..I guess I won't book a room there lol
---
Thank for this... but 900 hours! My buttocks would be so sore!
---
What are you doing about it? Are they looking into it or just saying too bad cya to you?
---
For some reason I read it as “dick hole in golf course is now open” and I was like, dick hole... that’s an interesting name for a shop...
---
I asked them to have a manager call me. If you want to ban me for something I did fine. But this is just wrong.
---
Theres a reason nobody takes workshops anymore
---
Oh guess I'm keeping mine semi-auto then sad the charging looked like it would be fun mechanic.
---
But they basically said no chance to appeal. No more Bethesda games ever. Enjoy
---
SPOILER - quest reward for Top of the World. 
---
Thanks officer, tell us more about how we should all play the game exactly like you do. Im going to move my camp to whitesprings right now so we'll both have something to do.
---
Wow you sound like an utter arsehole, take your downvote and leave 
---
There’s one on a wheelchair in Whitesprings, in the same building as all the golf outfits/clubs/etc.
---
I'm saying that it is debatable weather it is a coding error or a hardware configuration error, do you need English classes?
---
Thx..the thing is I don't remember doing that quest on my main character lol
---
Yeah cos marsupial and a jet pack are really hard to get hold of!! 
---
One thing to also note. If any of your amor adds carry weight that bonus is taken away when you enter power armor. Your power armor overrides your regular armor stats.
---
when did they send the email? I just got the same message just now. Logged in last night just fine.
---
Lool
---
Get yourself a gamma gun and simply keep firing on the horde as they destroy the base, you will refill their health for, hopefully, long enough to destroy the base without the wanted status 👍 the more you know
---
Some of those specific creature bonuses are quite good. For example, since the silos always have robots, troubleshooter is always good in them. I believe in the future when the vaults open, these legendary effects will become a lot more viable.
---
Its not a ban just a $!^* up per tech support
---
PvP is a mess and I’d be happy if they scrapped it on the normal game mode and kept it just for its own PvP servers. That way if you wanted a relaxing session you could join normal servers and join PvP when you feel ready 
---
Do you have radicool on?
---
I saw on Twitter and panicked. Logged in and found that thankfully, everything was still fine.
---
yup what he said excavator armor, and mine ore in lucky hole mine, walk out with almost 200+ ore, when smelted be sitting on 700-1000 lead scrap for 20ish minutes work.
---
Good to see someone that admits they're wrong. Good on you man
---
Im lvl 306 and ive converted all prine recievers back to normal cos its just a ludicrous amount of hassle for ammo!! So not even end game lol
---
Honestly the best scream of all time, very similar to homer Simpson's scream
---
You are wrong...and really that's the best you have??? English classes. You are a arrogant fool. Maybe you should learn how coding works before you start blaming hardware for failures. Please tell me how a reset is going to correct the Bobby pin weight? How about the sbq flying out of zone? How about server crashes that cause all players to disconnect yes a simple reboot will fix those issues. You sir are the dumbest person I have met.
---
I'm seeing about a dozen plus right now that receive message saying that they are banned for having over X amount of items but BEFORE they say that they go back and forth saying you're logging into BETA or to hard reset your console or re-install the game only to then reply with the ban hammer... 
---
You have to nuke everyday just to keep up with heavy flux. I switched mine back also!
---
Game was shipped unfinished.
---
What did you expect?
---
No we did not feel bad at first but they all were like really low new players. I was new as well around 30's but these guys were a lot lower like 5's and 10's
---
This happens to me ALL THE TIME and I can always eventually get in game. This is not a ban hammer, it's a technical issue. 
---
Kill legendaries. Do uranium fever event a few times and that gives 3 point per event for the 3 mile miners you kill.
---
Trying to get the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan. It’s a pain.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Yup i was irradiating grafton pretty regularly for violet flux
---
if your on ps4 hit me up PSN: Silune, be glad to help ya out.
---
Whenever I get wanted to just teleport to Whitesprings, sit somewhere and wait about 5 minutes for someone to crush me. 
---
Ah, maybe a bugged scorched with a shotgun. Little bastard followed me around the repair hut several times.
---
What console are you on? It helps to roll around with someone higher level and you will level up faster. 
---
I got the email like 2 hours ago as a response to an open support ticket for the issue.
---
Heck yeah! Jbbrown299 is my PSN, I'll be on later today.
---
You should level up on the west area. Everyone thinks you should push the main quest.  Instead take your time and level up to 40 or 50 to go east. It’s not meant to rush.
---
Yeah good luck with that. Many theories about it. But real only work around rebuild. That's why most dont spend time like we used to in sanctuary 
---
Oh ty for the info 
---
The LMG (aka MG42) also fires 308, so one of the plans was probably for that. I vaguely recall a glitch where one prime receiver plan unlocked the wrong ammo type, but I'm not sure which.
---
all these people who point the finger is the first to have bought duped items since the market is full. Also I can not access because Bethesda says I have over 100k of rare items, which is not true at all. Never exceeded the weight limit, never stacked rare items, but yes I shared and bought (in caps) some clearly duped weapons.
---
You seem be having trouble comprehending what was written. This is just troubleshooting 101. If your hardware is malfunctioning then there is no way to determine if it is a software bug.
---
already do. not for those reasons. each tom a player joins an area a mob is spawned. your mob, my mob, is taken buy the golf club squatter. thus denying your and mine, mobs and the loot that comes with it.
---
Per the people reporting this error to Bethesda and also on Twitter here you will see that many are getting banned for having either 100k or a million rare items... seems a bit much.   
---
Raw or stable?
---
Agreed! The music has been awesome as well. I love listening to the radio.
---
You’re just going to love my new artillery set-up.
---
How do you fast travel into your camp?
---
Stable 
---
Defiantly get the handmade. Tops the sniper... homemade anyway.
---
did you figure out how to attach the red light? IDK whee to go in the game files to rename the red tactical light in order to use it'
---
Idk for others platforms, I'm on ps4 and got the same error code. I just had to quit and launch the game to solve it.
---
I guess it was just a bug, not a real ban.
---
Man I can’t even imagine 5 workshops, that’s amazing!   I’ve dreamed of taking them all on a server. But I don’t think that can happen until there are private servers. 
---
I wish they where more persistent as-is, the building shouldn’t reset until the Monday server reset, or maybe have a “reset buildings” option at the workshop. 
---
Yeah i had that issue, now i dont bother moving my camp i placed mine at top of the world. For 3 reasons
---
1. Theres a junk pile nearby
---
2. Theres a trainstation with vendor nearby
---
3. It is somewhat located in the center of the map so fast traveling from there is like around 21 caps max  (when you have the cheaper fasttravel  perk equipped) 
---
They get 0 xp from turret kills nor do you obtain any (significant) loot from legendaries that spawn.  Is it stupid it make a camp there? Sure, but ffs man destroying a camp just because a turret sole your kill and you're saltier than a salt mine gives you no justifiable right to be a dick. 
---
IIRC the notification is something like "Unlocked material: BoS". Took me a while to figure out what I was actually unlocking, but it's just the helmet paints.
---
 That's where we farm. I had a guy in there at level 13 and he was just fine. I do know the area and how everything works, and am on a first name basis with Wallace. ;)
---
Appearing offline at the least. I’m not too familiar with the privacy settings anymore
---
Not sure on going rate but I'll give u 100c a piece for the violet
---
No they aren’t but you literally can’t get in if you tried.
---
I am on pc
---
It's been exceptionally rare in my experience to even get challenged at a workshop, and if you do, crouch, check the map, stash your springs / screws / ballistic fiber , and know that people are gunning for you - so turn off pacifist and get ready.
---
 No crafting or un-crouched activity at your camp if you know you are being targeted just in case they are base-wrecking types. 
---
And keep an upgraded gamma gun if you really want to deter people in good legendary armor.
---
I don't know what that is so i'm going to say no
---
Everything you said is wrong. PVP is fundamentally broken despite all the things you said in your rant about ignorance and blame.
---
Apparently there are like 5 masks that exist for it but there is just no known spawn locations for the other ones other than the creepy fasnachtman mask.
---
I myself have established an outpost there right next to Helvetia where there is a Steel vein and frequently go in to help clear out the scorched and point other players in directions of good loot in town and then give them some food, purified water, and steel scrap and a place to rest. If Bethesda ever stops muddling around and actually establishes a set faction system, I think I’ll probably found some sort of Helvetian Guard faction
---
Click on your "tent" icon.
---
 No they are trolls at heart. ;)
---
green thumb
---
There’s quite a few of us on here that have had the actual BOS LEGS (or arms or torso) notification appear, not the helmet paint. I had the helmet paint for a month before I got the notification. I know that with all the misinformation people do spread untruths due to confusion but I am sure of this experience and others in this forum verified the same experience of seeing the specific body part BOS notification appear but still being unable to apply it.
---
Level to 50, then main quest it... 
---
Incorrect... It will always be OK to fuck with someone's turret camp
---
You are rushing the game. Do some side quests and level up first.
---
I am not salty, i am lvl 132 got nearly all building plans and tbh i am looking for some pvp fun.  And  its freaking annoying when you are killing ghouls you are caught in those missile turrets fire.   So yeah i'm gonna shut those missile turrets down hoping the player would show up eventually. But he/she didnt and since i had a wanted lvl Already i just trashed the whole place. Its nothing about being salty. I just play the game like i want to.  
---
Sure. My GT is Xwolfpackleader 
---
Do you have a disc or digital download?
---
i got this quest from picking up a letter at Morgan town highschool
---
oh aite...just opened up a ticket myself. We'll see what happens.
---
&gt;I think you impact balance too much if you just give those cards out for free
---
Except they're not free. You'd still have to invest points into them on level up.
---
&gt;but there needs to be some cost to carrying a ton of stimpacks/radaways, and enough food to keep the well-fed bonus constantly up.
---
Yeah, it's called encumbrance. Weight reduction perks don't make the items weightless.  If you're carrying a ton of stimpacks, you are still going to be overweight. This isn't Fallout 4. Stimpacks weighed zero, unless you were playing survival. Then they weighed .1, which is the same weight of stimpacks in Fallout 76 with Tier 3 traveling pharmacy. 
---
I mean, I wish bethesda would put in a very serious look at re-balancing so those of us who are in for several hundred hours aren't in the position where every weapon and every chunk of armor we've gotten are absolutely garbage.   
---
Because I'm north of 300 hours. I haven't gotten a single "mid tier" legendary. I've gotten a couple single star decent weapons, and one double star with a single decent affect. Every other weapon I've gotten was \_garbage\_. Every bit of armor is similar...maybe one good affect, the rest are trash.   
---
That's not..fair or balanced either. That's why dupers have done so well, because it's \_frustrating\_ how absolutely \_shitty\_ the legendary system in this game IS. 
---
What was the code? I never found it.
---
😂
---
One time I was at whitesprings during a nuke and a low level guy gave me 10 water. He proceeded to follow me around and told me that he and his friend were duping purified water.  I blocked him so I could avoid joining unstable servers.
---
Nah, I'm just sick of sociopathic sacks of garbage pretending being a evil sack of shit, making other peoples game experience worse to make their experience better is "normal" or "ok". It's not, you're a fucked up, evil, sack of shit. 
---
A disc
---
It’s definitely random. Ironically the hunting rifle suppressor was the 3-4th mod I learned. Last mod I learn was the forceful stock that gives a lot of bonus CND.
---
With LMG I also tried it but need to double check. The problem is also that Russian localizers have translated “prime” differently in two different places - as something like “basic” and also as “best”. So I always need to check list in different places.
---
You're going to need to rebuild. But don't scrap first. Instead, store all of the components of the blueprint of the whole thing or else you lose half of the materials. 
---
You need to go into stored. The first or second item should be your blueprinted structure. I can't remember the exact steps from here, but I think you have an option to store. And then it will ask if you want to store all components. Say yes, and then it will break the whole thing down. Use the parts to build again. Only scrap if you definitely won't be using the remaining components.
---
For your next structure, it is recommended to manually blueprint everything except the foundation (I've heard maybe to exclude certain things on walls as well, but idk cuz I haven't done this yet). Then when you move, manually lay down the foundation. Then set your blueprint on top. Like I said, I haven't done this yet since I haven't moved since I read about it. But I have separately blueprinted my first level. And a separate for my second level. And a separate for my enclosed generator and she'd combined. 
---

---
I will look again but I'm sure I haven't unlocked it yet
---
So you mean ammo and receiver have both own plans?
---
I'm just trying to track if it is disc or digital, thanks! 
---
I'll add ya the next time I'm on. I've spent way too much time building 
---
I'm not referring to how much ram your system has, but the speed and timings of the ram in your configuration. An unstable configuration that corrupts the memory can obviously result in ingame bugs. Note that all xmp memory is overclocked and operating beyond it's manufactures specifications.
---
By troubleshooting your hardware you can avoid some of these so-called bugs.
---
Bro a bobbypin has it's own plan (jk) but yeah makes things more grindy!
---
ok ill be on tonight at around 9. ive got a anti armor broadsider, minigun, and fat boy
---
What was said above.. team up with someone 35+ makes it easier when you travel east. I had to stop the main quest and just go on side missions to level up because of the same reason you said. Now I’m level 50 so maybe time to continue the main quest. 
---
A friend of mine started playing last week, he’s now level 16 after like 20 hours playing.. he just wanders around with me (his quests and mine) hitting higher level enemies and then I kill them. Also make sure to be well rested for the +5% xp bonus and use perk cards under charisma to help boost your xp 
---
Oh no, anything but downvotes please.  How can live live my life without your validations?  Hope I didn’t hurt your fragile feelings.   
---
It’s condescending?  Good it was intentional.  That’s how comedy works.
---
Your on a public forum on the internet.  If you are looking for a none sarcastic and comforting place, try your parent’s basement. 
---
I’d love to craft some bobby pins and become a bobby pin tycoon.
---
 No idea. My point was that this is common. I stopped bothering about these little hooks quite a while ago.
---
holy hell, thank you boio
---
Turn down the heat.  Snowflakes are melting.  
---
Just explore west, i first explored the forest, then went to  toxic valley, then ash heap. After that i went east to savage divide, then the mire and at last the cranberry bog. Dont just do the main quest line. I think its boring anyways. I just explored and discovered fav spots.  
---
Drop by the Whitesprings fountain for all ailments 😷
---
No, the Mirelurk had a horde with it, that's what I meant
---
Thats cool didn't know that was a thing and looks like a lot is missing especially if it thinks pubg is my most recorded lol I played ark for 2 years.
---
only getting 1 crash each week on PC.
---
I dont know what you expected when you bought a Bethesda game for a console.
---
Do the enclave events dropped connection, bots on parade, and signal booster (?). They give out 1, 1, and 2 commendations respectively. Bots on parade is the easiest of the 3, but I was able to complete all of these events with little trouble at lvl 30.
---
Wasteland score is great but I am disappointed in applachia radio.
---
Approach the laser grid, exit power armor, unequip veil/garb, re-equip, walk thru.
---
You are not smart so stop pretending. Your logic is far from right you need to stick to your own profession.
---
can I get ' how much do you craft/vendor?' on a tshirt
---
Go into a nuke zone run around with other players and when you see a legendary make sure to hit it at least once. I was at 3/10 went into a nuke zone yesterday and next thing I knew it was completed after like 5 minutes.
---
I think it's a generic and lazy response every conversation seems to play out like
---
1. Restart your game
---
2. Restart your launcher
---
3. Restart your computer/console
---
4. Oh that didn't work? Prob got banned for having 1mil items because that is all I got!
---
Exactly why I cannot get enough of this game
---
Never saw a 91 claw there in the past but now I see them there all the time.
---
And the thing is, I expected NMS to fail, and I expected bethesda to rise to the challenge and make improvements. And I'll be honest, this update, this "remove the dupes" update is the _first_ update which I haven't seen as one step forward, six steps back. 
---
Ya I don’t know exactly how far back it stores videos, and it’s not instantaneous if you just made a video or screenshot, but it’s an easy way to share recent stuff from Xbox. 
---
Found 6 or 7 bags in the north end of the cemetery (out West past the Nuka Cola factory) in a small wooden outbuilding.
---
If i remember while can You find the code,  on the first floor. Its in the room up stairs.  When you look through the window you can see the security door. 
---
bruh im level 225 with 850 hours lol.. being playing since beta thoo
---
I think it is routinely sold at the bunker.  Try the “production” area, not the “armory.”
---
Be careful bobbypins are a rare item that weighs like 5 pounds so you can only carry 10 but will get flagged for having to many legendary Bobby pins and might get banned!
---
Well at least your triggered responses are entertaining. 
---
I personally reserve “fucked up, evil, sack of shit” for people who actually try to hurt people in real life. You’re free to think that this description applies in a virtual post apocalyptic wasteland video game that’s indebted to have player versus player mechanic of course.
---
 The Protect the Robots events are pretty tame and you can do them solo. Any Legendary kill should get you a point, although it can be bugged. I got a point off a Level 1 Legendary Eyebot in the Glass Caverns. ;)
---
457... people harass me for being 254. They should get a load of you!!! 😂
---
As a shotgun user, I am THRILLED to see this! Thank you so much for taking the time to collect these details. I hope you heal from your injury soon! 
---
Had a similar experience when I was low level, but I shouted "Train to zone" to the two poor low levels I ran past, from ancient habit. To my surprise one of them got the old EverQuest reference. Felt good. Also felt like I am ancient.
---
The product shipped as a bug filled barely finished product. It's still, in any sense that matters, not a viable product in that it is still bug filled in major gameplay aspects. 
---
It _did not perform as expected for a finished game product_ and the patches as yet have done something to address that, but they've introduced more bugs, and sometimes significantly LARGER bugs. 
---
I'm disappointed that they've nerfed the legendary system, the loot system, the event system in numerous ways. That's disappointing. 
---
The _state of the game_ is unacceptable. There is a difference. 
---
I wouldn't be suprised if Helevetia gets an update in March, considering there's dialogue in game for Faschnacht as well as a lot of masks 
---
this isnt fallout 4
---
Sorry for your losses. Ya as it is PVP is a bit out of whack but I do say it adds alot to the game. I do think there should be revisisons to adventure to mode to cater to the PVE crowd. Survival will be a different story tho as it will be constant PVP and killin others on sight wont constitute abuse or griefing anymore
---
I shoot them with Gatling gun until they land. Then it's all two handed melee from there. Methods vary depending on whatever perks you've chosen. 
---
Wow 
---
I mean, I guess...but doesn't it have some carry weight?
---
never camped at whitesprings, but i have never gotten a drop off anything my turrets killed unless i actually hit it.
---
I think this player enjoys the replay ability. Repetitive grind. I'm the same way. I'll clear out the same locations and run the same events over and over for days. 
---
I've played a bit since beta but recently the wife and I, @trinshady, decided to start over and tbh we've had a blast.  We now use our bigger accounts, 140+, less and less.  I can't seem to completely abandon it when it can make mutations and it's another stash box but I'm liking climbing the ladder again.  See you out there!
---
Yuup 
---
The advice from others, to take your time or to partner up with a higher leveled friend, is good. If you're insistent on advancing the main story though, scorched shouldn't be -that- much of an issue, even with just a hunting rifle. (I used one and a lever action rifle to level 50.) Pick up Concentrated Fire from the Perception tree, and use stealth and headshots as much as possible. 
---
Also, are you using power armor? I'm guessing not, since at level 23, the only suit available might be the very "meh" raider power armor. Check out the mines around Welch, and you should get a quest that you can complete at level 25 to get some excavator power armor. You're going to need that damage resistance, not for the scorched leaders, but for the nastier stuff out there like scorchbeasts, anglers and super mutants with rocket launchers. 
---
It says 0 but i never checked actually
---
It’s very beautiful. I’d recommend visiting and white sulfur springs is awesome too. Greenbrier County has a lot of cool natural attractions, including lost world caverns and the organ caverns. I think both are in the game just under different names (I know Lost World is in it just renamed to Uncanny Caverns because both of them have the”bat boy” legend to them)
---
&gt;That's why everyone has been asking for PVP servers and for PVP to be disabled in the regular game. But nope, nothing from Bethesda except crickets.
---
Well let's take the view that this sub took when people were complaining about the lack of NPCs on release:
---
It was always advertised to be a PvP-on game. If you didn't want that then why did you buy the game? Stop complaining about how the game is just because you don't enjoy it, maybe next time check what a game is before buying it.
---
I second this.
---
There’s something really bugged with carry weights and PA.. my normal carry weight without armor is 260, in the PA it goes to 325, log out go to play again and it’s 425.. switch severs and it went to 525. Got disconnected a while later and then carry limit went to 425.. exited PA then when I got back in, the limit was 325. I changed nothing, and nothing happened giving me weight advantage/disadvantage. Incredibly confusing 
---
I have but, it may have been changed in a patch idk
---
Lead mining and bullet crafting 
---
Probably would be easy enough to make. Could make a copy of the default map with all the location markers and recolor them so they stand out and use that image as a new "map" texture.
---
I play MULTIPLE other online games. None of them are anything even REMOTELY like this experience, by quality developers that I will still do business.   
---
The only other game that I've had similar negative "I'm not sure I want to give this company my money" experience I've had is fucking \_ark\_. 
---
Get him up. Sleep for XP and play one of my instruments. Pull up all my guns and look at the ammo level. Make ammo for those guns that need it and walk from deep in the Mire to The Whitespring. ;)
---
As a level 100 who still enjoys story time and juice with Miss Nanny Bot I cannot pass judgement 
---
All paints come out of the Atom store. X0-1 armor does have a yellow/dark blue when you make the prototype one.
---
Gotta love having comments deleted and down votes from pointing out the health concerns of playing that amount of hours in such a short time.
---
You people all need help.
---
I just don’t see how doing the same brain dead content is fun and how does this game have any replay ability?!? What? But if you enjoy it play it man!
---
Yeah there are a ton of areas that need more going on. 
---
Cheaters gonna cheat see ya later cheater
---
Btw, does anyone know of other recipes and uses for honey? I can’t find any
---
The nearest chemistry workbench I believe is in the Highschool. Directly above the principle's office is the science classroom. Just watch out for hostiles. I also believe there's one in the waterlogged trainyard nearby but I'm not sure, but even then, I'm sure you'd be taking in hella rads without a Hazmat Suit.
---
On your map, you should now see some new events called Enclave events - These are different from the other events, which typically have a bunch of steps and might rely on some cooperation with others. The Enclave events, all of them are pretty easy - activate some satellites in an area, for example, or defend a Bot Stop for three minutes. 
---
I'll be on shortly, wanna join up? I'll basically take you to all the fissure sites and murder some beasts 
---
It doesn't have a nuka paint?
---
Actually, I went into this knowing that bethesda had made the completely immoral decision to make it impossible to get refunds. But it's bethesda, even their shitty games have some appeal.   
---
And it's true that I've put in a lot of hours in this game... technical issues aside, the game world is interesting, even if most of the game mechanics are broken.   
---
Expecting quality from a product, expecting the game to get better, not worse, is reasonable. Your response to this game is not. 
---
I agree. I just bought the game two weeks ago and I think there should at least be 1 side quest per town that attracts people to it 
---
Go play the others then especially New Vegas, you won't regret it
---
I've only done a transfer once, when I used my alt to build something for someone from here, and used the opportunity to have them hold some stuff to give to my main. I guess you could say it's risky, but really I wasn't going to get it another way, and it wasnt the end of the world if I lost them. But i know a lot of people use alt mules to circumvent the stash limits or atock up for player vending. Its not uncommon. You just need aomeone you are willing to trust with valuables.
---
FYI the update next week will make it so accidentally damaging someone's camp won't make you wanted. 
---
!remind me 2 hours
---
What system do u play on. I like a challenge
---
Aren't horde mode events broken currently?  EVERY TIME..EVERY TIME I port in to one it disappears.  Sometimes a little later it announces completed, despite being nowhere near where the event was. This completion comes with no reward.  
---
Again this happens every time.  Because of this I've completely given up on horde events. 
---
350 hours on Xbox One
---
New Vegas has an online option?
---
This is the same for my build, ha. Like the only decent armor mod I have is pocketed, so I have like an extra 20 pounds when I'm not in power armor as a result. 
---
No problemo 👍 
---
It's one of the few downsides to being wanted... You can't hide ever... Otherwise you could take your time sneaking to a stash to offload junk stolen from people who failed to kill you making hunting wanted players even less of an incentive for people... As is most wanted players are kitted for PvP reduction and running in a team waiting for someone to show up and 4v1 them in an ambush... I think they need pve servers without any PvP elements personally as it doesn't make a lot of sense for these people who spent decades together in the vault to suddenly turn to breaking everything each other built as they try to rebuild... PvP in fallout is just stupid
---
Don't lose hope yet, there's an event at the northern part of the CB that spawns level 50+ 3* legendary enemies.
---
Pasting my input from another thread:   Are you a widescreen user? Widescreen support broke for a lot of us. I  solved the problem by deleting Fallout76Prefs.ini. 
---
If that does not solve it, try uinstalling and manually deleting all Fallout76 folders, followed by deleting the prefs ini if needed.
---
Also Grimm reapers sprint.  I heard they stopped critical shot use from filling next shot on purpose but didn't hear why Grimm and clover stopped. 
---
Yep, AWOL
---
I just think many weights need to be lower in general. A rifle has no business weighing 20+ pounds.
---
Last time it was mentioned was 14 days ago. You know the more you know. Right. 
---
The Dragon.
---
Again,Bullshit.
---
Sadly no ruby its only for t51
---
No, Fallout has always been a single player franchise up until 76. The Single player games are absolutely amazing and probably all even better than 76.
---
Whitesprings, collecting plastic and pvp 
---
Only the T51-b has that and you get it from doing the Nuka Cola quest. Here is a walk through... pretty easy...   
---

---
Well damn.
---
Its sad yeah theyll probably add more with the upcoming dlc
---
Yeah I played Vegas and 4 but "TGM"'d my way to boredom... I'll likely revisit those in Kuwait over the next year.
---
That one change alone lowers significantly how many crits you can fire off, which makes the vats crit legendary effect even worse than it was, and I'm not sure the crit perks are even worth it now.
---
u/bethesdagamestudios
---
hello?
---
Nah. The design philosophy at Bethesda in regard to this game is to make it as intentionally anti-fun as possible right now. 76 is indeed the purest form of the survival genre. You have to survive countless attempts by the game to make life as difficult as possible for you.
---
Me too, for weeks it has happened.   Looking in again and no problems.   
---
It better not be AS skins either.
---
Yeah I got killed by a scorched clipped into the ground
---
Hello OldManPlayingGames. Your response was a little loss to me, but would I be corrected in saying... 
---
You got a response saying you aren't banned, but they won't be able to fix it over the weekend?
---
Hey man. I messaged you on xbox live with my requests.
---
Since when is getting banned for having a million rare items a bit much? There is no way to acquire that legitimately. No way at all.
---
Like I said, nothing against the proposal, we need a hub somewhere. I would like the top of the world rather than the Vault, because it has all those shops already, and Rose's radio station and is fitting better ot the survival theme.
---
Most will be like the new mothman one they'll add but eventually theres gonna be but xo1 is a funny armor cause where its at in the fallout lore its young not like the brotherhood gear where they added paints to distinguish ranks 
---
I get 40% from heavy gunner perks, the boost from stabilized, bloody mess, and have one point into the luck heavy guns perk. 
---
Grimm and clover were the corner stone of my build. Now it's a waste of six perk points and cards.  Now I'm having to majorly adjust and waste six levels of new luck perks and i don't even know if they'll be fixed as soon as i respec!  
---
Been hopping the train car (pun?) since you posted...only found Marine legs, torso etc so far but I’ll keep at it for a bit
---
Wait Helvetia is a real place in West Virginia? I was excited to see my country mentioned in a game like Fallout. Never expected there were swiss Immigrants with their little own village in WV. 
---
Just because it is available at that level doesn't necessarily mean it will be in the card set you receive at that level, a lot of times you'll get dupes of cards you already own, I think it's a random draw...
---
Get rid of turrets they’re almost pointless 
---
That's not...exactly....accurate.  There's some weirdness with groups, and as long as you dont get the \[DANGER\] sign.  But otherwise pretty much that.
---
I use it to bounty bait ppl into fightin me, it's pretty reliable and it usually leads to a bit of fun without griefing and using the PVP mechanics as intended.some ppl can wreck me pretty quick while I kill s on me pretty quick. I've noticed different tactics and loadouts make a big difference. I wont say it's always fair or balanced but I dint think it can be with all the possible combinations of perks armor and weapons available. I'm jus waitin for survival mode already
---
The average player, without ultimate min-maxing, would maybe double their base damage output using a pure crit build in a good fight.
---
I see that as different from many of the nerfs, especially the TSEs, which more than quadrupled base damage output with minimal perk investment and no stat/luck vats micromanagement.  Really totally different circumstance. 
---
I want to hope that they can be made to realize this.
---
TOTW &amp; WWW are glitched for me.
---
Good shout I guess. And what about the stash box? How do I use that more efficiently?
---
Pretty sure you can have either Shadowed (dark grey/black or BOS (dark blue w/ white BOS insignia on the Chest)

halp?
---
total means squat. t51b has the same ballistic and more energy than ultracite. that's all that matters.
---
ultracite has more rad indeed, but it's still not enough. you need x01 for nukes.
---
and ultracite is nowhere near as common as black titanium or springs.
---
Half pvp in fallout is just stupid. If it was a full pvp game it would be fine, if it was a full co-op game it would be fine. But playing both sides of the fence trying to appease everybody isn't going to accomplish anything meaningful.
---
Oh yeah Helvetia exists. It’s a little tourist area but yeah everything about it is pretty factual. It was settled by Swiss and German settlers and is known for its fasnacht celebration. Here’s a link to images of the [gift store](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Gw7UnAC) there

1 mini Nike to a CAMP nets me bout a 80-100 cap bounty. Alot of damage but very few things will actually be destroyed
---
Yup , when you view/inspect it is just plain ol' clothing weighing .1 but when you equip it replaces whatever other underarmor you may have on.  It also replaces any other outer clothing you may have on, and you can see it on top of regular limb armor.  You can also upgrade it on a workbench like under armor.
---
So not sure if it's supposed to be regular clothing or under armor, it is trying to be both lol, it looks awesome in any case.
---
I'm not sure how they acquired a million or a hundred thousand of anything combined! lol That's a lot of stuff not too mention weight!   
---
I have like 500 in my stash and maybe total weight of my character is 220-250? Crazy! 
---
Oh also, does Ultracite have any paints?
---
A friend of mine runs a berserker build and lives in a hazmat suit. Berserker relies on there being no damage resistance, and to our understanding, radiation resistance isn't part of that. Id assume his build is working properly since he can one shot most higher lever mobs. 
---
yeah, it is rough.  always busy, that is for sure.  i usually run only 3, but since the server was empty, went for 5.  
---
Ultracite and excavator are the only two with out any form of paint even from the atomshop
---
They can't get the loot, either.
---
They gain nothing from turret kills if they aren't there to tag.
---
Its randomized. I got the Supressor on both the hunting and handmade rifle as one of the first mods. For the handmade it was first. I was pretty happy xD
---
Hunting rifle mods are easy to learn. They are so many on enemies in the world.
---
You should list it on ug4m.com and get paid IRL money. 
---
The Mire isn't recommended for players under level 30.  Here's a link to a map which shows recommended levels for regions
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/
---
They share a few key popular misconceptions.
---
Shoot, stab, shoot, stab, eat, drink, shoot, sell, craft, repair. Oh crap wendigos.
---
Did u craft ur handmade and then scrap it?
---
Rip
---
Yes. Handmades are very rare to find. 
---
No real point in exploring anything in this game tbh. You'll never really find anything of worth or relevance so just do the quests and grind it out for endless wood armours I guess.
---
&gt; *The beta was incredibly short, and hardly gave a clear indication of what the game would actually be like. Everyone was fixated on the bugs, so much so that PVP rarely happened.* 
---
Not Bethesda's fault that players did not research what they said from day one, your fault.
---
&gt; Someone can initiate the workshop and not even take it. They track you down and kill you. That's an exploit 
---
This only works if the target had taken a workshop, with which they are PVP legal. Don't like doing PVP, then don't take workshops.  Still your fault, not Bethesda's.
---
&gt; I like most other players are well aware of the silly pacifist mode. It's fucking lame and no one save for you and three others actually likes it. That's why people are begging for PvP servers to get rid of you annoying scrubs 
---
No where did I say I like the way Pacifist Mode works, but I am not ignorant of how it works and understand how to use it. Now making assumptions is your fault.
---
&gt; Edit: also, even if you're not using revenge, you can still get killed. Even if you respawn and use pacifist mode, PvP doesn't reset. The only way to stop it is close out of the entire game and restart it. That's just dumb. No way to turn PvP off is terrible 
---
Never have had to do this.  In the very few times I have had to deal with PVP, when I got killed, I just respawned, grabbed my stuff (if I needed to), and blocked/changed servers.  Did not see that person again. lost a whopping 30 caps.  Made that back in 5 minutes.
---
Is it locked up?
---
Thx I have those plans for both of my characters..this is kind of frustrating to me because I wanna mod some cool weapons..suppressor is def my fave mod 
---
&gt; as it doesn't make a lot of sense for these people who spent decades together in the vault to suddenly turn to breaking everything each other built as they try to rebuild
---
But jim was always an ass and no one really liked him cus he was always picking fights for no reason. So would anyone really miss him if he just... disappeared?
---
PVP is imperfect, but not broken.  Don't like a game with PVP elements, don't play the game.
---
It's both. There have been plenty of topics.
---
The only circle jerk here is someone on board the "STOP LIKING WHAT I DON"T LIKE" train
---
He said he has done everything in the game, why would he ask what else is there to do?   Also there was no defending in my response. 
---
That would destroy the value of getting 3* legendary armor with weight reduction affixes. Levels are unlimited and everyone would have full access to all weight cards at all times. Leveling up 3 times to forever have a 90% weight reduction is ridiculous. If you dont want to invest the cards the route is to invest the time in armor. 
---
Your idea would absolutely destroy the gear balance of the endgame. The person who suggested permanent application to the stash and required application on our characters hit it perfectly. That makes sense and doesnt make 95% of legendary gear instantly worthless.
---
That's very good to hear. Do you know if it's standard or just part of pacifist mode?
---
Maybe try defending yourself next time. You were joining the same server obviously. The guy didn't "follow" you around.
---
I'm having a lot of trouble with this also. I find that I gather WAY too much cloth and asbestos and it's not really used for much. If I make sure to only keep 100 scrap of each thing then I'm good. Also, ONLY bulking Lead and Aluminium, because if you bulk other items it can make them heavier. I hope this helps a little bit. \*just keeping my fingers crossed for that 800 weight limit soon\* :)
---
I've actually started shooting at radio's when I hear Country fucking Road!
---
Yeah this game is fucking amazing
---
The only songs I really like on the radio are classical and John Denver's Country Roads. I usually turn radios off so I can hear footsteps. Especially in areas where I am under leveled.
---
I'd take that or have the takeover be immediately successful if the current owner is in pacifist mode. I occasionally take workshops to build the resource collectors for anyone passing through to take from and for fast travel. I don't want to fight for it. If someone else tries to take it, let them have it.
---
I traded for a tse handmade so i get the plan and started scrapping. Still dont have all, but the ones i need like hardened receiver. It takes a long time, you need tons of springs. Farm them in Sugar Grove or Camp Mc Flintlock. Use the scrapper perk to get lot of steel from Weapons. Scrap them all. Use super duper when crafting handmade to get double the amount. If you do it with efficiency you will have alle the mods quickly. 
---
I think it’s more related to the fact that you’re using a new account, this is your first post on this sub, and your outlook is using your opinion to project your rationalized theory of what’s healthy. 
---
How about go play the game some before you talk shit and claim it’s not worth it. How about also post a bit more around here with some actual constructive advice instead of throwing your unwanted opinion at someone who didn’t care or ask for it. And last but most importantly, just find a new game and sub because obviously this just isn’t gonna work out GifCo, no one likes you here.
---
I'd have to say too that any safe or crate has a chance at having the plan as long as it's far south from vault 76
---
See, here's the trick. Sociopathic tendencies are telling. "I don't care that this person does not want to engage in this gameplay mechanic, and are avoiding me, I am going to kill them, because it is fun" is a clear sign of sociopathic behavior. 
---
Maybe you only express that in video games, maybe murdering people in games is your outlet. 
---
That doesn't make it ok, it doesn't make you a good person, it doesn't make you choosing to make your game more fun by making mine LESS fun any more "OK".
---
It makes you garbage. 
---
I remember being level 8... I kept fighting other people for no reason.
---
It’s not impossible, it’s just a lot damn harder. I myself am only level 30 and know how difficult it is with higher level players floating around, making mutants higher levels.
---
It’s easier when you run with a friend as part of a team! There’s only me and my bf on a team right now and it definitely helps a lot, even though we’re both a similar level 
---
Thats awesome. Its ironic, in 3 weeks there is Fasnacht here. Its a huge event in the area. 
---
Not quite sure why it makes me so happy to see that couples are playing this together. 
---
Perhaps because i wish i had that Lol
---
He stays. You go play Call of Duty.
---
If you’re storing a bunch of weapons, then just scrap anything you don’t plan on using heavily. Same goes with armor, though it doesn’t weigh as much. If you have any legendary lies you’re not using, then sell them or give away. Also check your aid stash. There are perks to lower weight, but they don’t work on your stash items. If you have the perks to lower chem weights it’s much better just to carry them all with you. 
---
I've just been grabbing and storing everything. I didnt know bulking items made them heavier. Also, where I am only level 30 I have collected so many level 50 guns and stored them in my stash box. I'm worried i wont find them again later..
---
There are allot of crates and safes at the cutthroat camp I mentioned. And possible legendary enemies too 
---
I have a TSE handmade but it was already fully modded by the previous owner..I didn't kno U can mod TSEs
---
Also is it making a gurgling sound, kinda like a stomach about half an hour after eating some bad sushi
---
the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment
---
My first TSE was a TSE Dragon. That thing was incredible, 2000 damage, but sadly unsuably post nerf bc of the 23 sec reload time. 
---
Thanks. Good shout. I dont even use chems other than rad away and stim packs.
---
Damn OP, if you were on xbox I would pay good caps for that! There are players who collect low level explosive weapons and that would be a dream!
---
Entirely. Only time I actually interact with in-game vendors is to drain them.
---
Use the Pharma Finder perk that gives you a second search on aid containers. I get most of my antibiotics and disease cures that way.
---
Good because this was getting annoying
---
I’m sorry you can’t aim 🥇
---
First of all 10 plus hours 7 days a week is not my "projection" of what is healthy there bud. It's scientific fact.
---
Second I wasn't aware you required a Reddit account and posts on the FO76 thread to be able to play the game. 
---
You seem very triggered and your use of SJW terms is rather revealing. You seem like a very angry 14 year old and I'd appreciate it if you stay out of the convo when adults are talking.
---
Hoooooly crap thats  amazing
---
This is literally what happened. Game locked up. Alt f4. Can't get back in. 
---
One spawns in the church in Helvetia. You have to go upstairs and to the stairway next to the steeple. It should be there next to a chair with a gun
---
Repetitive idiot.
---
I get this on my 2nd ps4 whenever I swap characters. Without fail.
---
I also get it there sometimes when I log on for the first time. 
---
Anyone found out a way to fix it? I haven't been able to get back out since last night?
---
Yea there tech support says not banned but seems this is ongoing issue thousands of high lvl accounts.  They didnt say when or why is happening, just betting will be days before fix
---
After a stranger gave me a TSE Dragon that became useless after the nerf i wanted to get a tse handmade since it gets buffed by rifleman, which was already high skilled bc i play a stealth sniper.
---
Took me like a week until i found a good one. Sold a few pieces on the way when i was browsing. We need a Trader Hotspot in Whitesprings with Player Vendor Terminals.
---
Its much safer than on trade subs and also easier. 
---
If that's the case, then I must look a kind man who leaves gifts for the children but is secretly suspected to be a pedophile by some of the parents.
---
Maybe leave something behind for the children to make up for the loss of junk. I'm always placing a highly modded low level weapon or armour piece, some food, water and few aid items in the overseer's stash.
---
Mine's not two-shot, but I love my Hunter's exploding plasma gatling. People can have it when they pry it out of my cold, dead hands.
---
This.
---
You beat me to it, but yes all of this and maybe some others.
---
Never. 
---
You can mod any weapon, standard or legendary. Just need the mods for it. My handmade had not good attachments so i had to get them by scrapping and attaching them. 
---
Very normal. You see the worms are living organisms made out lf smooth muscle tissues. Since they are obviously mutated it is logical to assume that they are significantly stronger than normal worms. You have a bunch of them inside your body now so of course theh are helping you carry the extra weight.
---
They don't like being in power armour and refuse to help if ypu wear it because they are afraid of being the worms in the proverbial can of worms.
---
They're just tryna lift stuff bro.
---
No its not the case, none of my accounts on main gt arw oc. Its a glitch believed due to large number of trades that were flagged by new system
---
Lol...so this sub finally admits they're happy to play FO alone.
---
Thx I'm always scared it will remove the TSE mod itself lol
---
I have a 1M X 1M map on my wall that I downloaded and tile printed. It shows almost all the locations for FO76. Found it at game-maps.com.
---
The most interesting questions of course:  what had eluded you, and what do you wear?
---
Thanks for the write a few things I need to check out, I only have been to some of those spots once.
---
Did you wonder the map or just farm an area? I have seen and heard a type of item drop more frequently in specific areas. Like raider armor in the savage divide.
---
Not a 100% sure, but the last Inside The Vault indicated it would take a malicious attempt to destroy someone's base to become wanted. I'm assuming you actually need to destroy whole structures for that to happen. Stray bullets or splash damage shouldn't cause you to become wanted.
---
I personally hate Mirelurk Hunters, Radscorpions, and Yao Guai, especially Yao Guai...
---
Explosive or Two Shot are legendary modifiers and symbolize a star. The modifications on the weapons are attachment. A legendary modifier cannot be unequiped by any means nor can the weapon be destroyed. You can add a star if you add a scorch receiver to the weapon IIRC. 
---
Thx bud..now I know 
---
Not really defending the guy, but these are the same people who have made it to where I can't even attach a red headlamp to a power armor anymore due to coding that went wrong. 
---
Well damn, that's perfectly logical and understandable. I never thought a video game would go into such depths of reality. There goes the whole 'video game logic' meme. 
---
You don't have a say
---
It's a known bug that they're looking into. Players only get one of each region's daily quests to trigger for them instead of all daily quests being available.
---
The 20 caps you got was for completing the misc quest of talking to the bot running the game. What should happen is you then get the option to start the daily quest. With any quests, I find it's most reliable if you wait for each stage to register on your HUD before moving on to the next step, especially if it involves and item (like picking up the dross for the dross toss). I've had a quest get stuck because I picked up an item before the quest progression was "ready" for me to. Relogging usually fixes that though.
---
There are two...south and North, did u mean one specifically?
---
Thank you for sharing what sounds like the most logical response
---
on the ball?
---
Irish/UK?
---
Taking some nice pictures, doing a vendor selling round, killing enemies on the way. Lately im doing a lot of workshop claiming to get more camp items. I also engage in every SBQ fight happening on my server (lvl 86).
---
I also change my camp often, adding more details and just enjoying the view.
---
Omg I'm so ready!! But your right , I jus hope I can keep up with the players rockin mutations out the ass 
---
I see a refund in my future
---
They are actually “trying” to fix that bug. Apparently it’s not supposed to make them heavier if you bulk things. But right now the only thing that makes more room is the lead and aluminum. But yes I’m a murder hobo too. I pick up EVERYTHING. It helps when I’m with friends and someone is like man i need screws. Well come on down I’ve got 2,000. Lol not really but it feels like it. 
---
I'm never over encumbered. I fast travel constantly. 
---
I like rare weapons and an explosive level 5 weapon is rare. I barely had it a day before giving it away. 
---
4 of my shotguns are max level. I have TSE rifles and a TSE pump action but the accuracy penalty hurts a lot. My current ones are a troubleshooters, a bloodied and a medics. 
---
Cranberry relish I'm not sure. I've just played a ton so found most by accident. 
---
Against SBs I use enforcer plus vats to crit and cripple a wing. They usually land very soon afterwards. 
---
I'm constantly using vats. It's normal for me to run to the front area of west Tek stand on something with high ground and let VATS and gunfu kill everything. 
---
Mirelurk queens are rough. Best bet is to try cripple it's legs and use grenades. They take like 5 blasts to the face from my shotgun and still sometimes kill me with the poison attack. These things are brutal. 
---
I use macros on PC. One macro spams E very quickly. You can get multiple harvests from 1 node. Usually 12 ore from each ore node. And then stingwings make good acid to smelt it. And they're worth good exp. 
---
Unless your stealth killing everything, there's no way your completing the main story from start to finish. Get a team mate or something. Level up. Don't rush the game. Find a legendary or two. 
---
How did you find out how to get support? I'm having the issue too.
---
No...American (if Irish stock 😉)
---
And deep into Anglo entertainment 
---
A defence that produces resources :'D 
---
next time ya have a weekend off, grab some energy drinks and sugary snacks, stay up really late (possibly take a mid evening nap) and into the early morning you will notice if you get into a server around 9ish pm, by midnight 1 am people start dropping off, 3ish maybe 5 or 6 on server, by about 4 youre usually solo.. run around take all the ws just build your things and a TON of turrets covering every angle of fire.. and enjoy.. 
---
I usually get on audio first to warn the area that I am about to destroy the camp.
---
This results in logouts about 50% of the time.
---
If no answer or logout within 1 minute, then I go ham (banking all my junk first). 
---
Then I go beg another player to kill me to remove the bounty :)
---
I will destroy those camps 100% of the time.
---
&gt; That would destroy the value of getting 3* legendary armor with weight reduction affixes.
---
Why? Do weight reduction armor affixes not apply to items that have had their weight reduced by perks or something?
---
&gt;. Levels are unlimited and everyone would have full access to all weight cards at all times.
---
Once again,
---
#**That is the fucking point**.
---
And no, everyone would not have access to them *all* weight cards *all* the time. To get them all you'd have to invest 34 [perk](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks) points and most people are probably going to focus on perks that actually fit their playstyle and go after the other stuff after they've finished their builds. 
---
&gt;Your idea would absolutely destroy the gear balance of the endgame.
---
No, it fucking won't.
---
&gt;That makes sense and doesnt make 95% of legendary gear instantly worthless.
---
Must be some pretty shitty legendaries you've acquired if their only value is weight reduction. 
---
Doing the Lord's work.
---
To add to this, click the railing on the balcony of the watch tower
---
It does. This is the reason they do it.
---
For 3475345 shitty 1* legendaries.
---
Nope, everyone should go hard anyway, that way at least they'll have data to make appropriate nerfs. They're gonna nerf it anyway, may as well show them exactly what the issues are. Or are we just gonna whine about things in general like we did with TS and E?
---
Because you open yourself up for PvP by capturing the workshop. It is fairly obvious the PvP is meant to revolve around the workshop. Not as an excuse to find someone miles away and level their camp.
---
Yeah I know it is easy enough to repair, that doesn't stop it being annoying.
---
So called "raiders" don't GET anything for leveling a camp so it is out and out griefing. 
---
You're really not wrong. People just react negatively when you straight up tell them they're unhealthy for spending so much time on an activity. Especially in a game sub, half the people here probably have similar hours.
---
900 hours, did you lose a bet
---
Same. 
---
Ypu probably have a Eagle Eyes Phantom mutations. You can check this if you take Rad-X. It shows up as surpressed but wont show up as active. The only way to get it active is to get rid of it with RadAway and ger it back. You also wasted the serums sadly.
---
This happens when  you gain a mutations and immediatly dying after. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCbWUGGTvBiwzWZEg06l0w
---
Irish stock will do. I formally adopt you, mo deartháir. :)
---
Damn. If that’s it, it’s a pretty dumb oversight. It wouldn’t have been too hard to code a if discovered check that ran the first time you log in after that patch.
---
Looking at the map and seeing how many people are around me so I can server hop to do my story quests in peace (level ten).
---
My rule is to keep non-rare junk to 150 maximum and then sell the rest as bulk, also if you don't use explosives, get rid of missiles, fatmans, ECT. This also helps make you caps but selling bulk junk to vendors or players.
---
the pilar what hold the turret missing form the zipfile. can u upload it?
---
Lead and aluminium. I'll have a look and see if I've got an abundance of these.
---
I plan on opening a mutation shop, and calling it The X-Mansion. If anything, people will just come for the gimmick lol.
---
Haven’t done any of the photo ones yet, but this is good to know. Thanks.
---
I'm on a laptop with a 940mx and it works fine. 
---
I love that the whiskey ingame says uisce beatha...damn straight 
---
Weight reduction caps out at 90%. I have all weight cards maxed. I have 5 piece sets of all types of weight reduction gear which add up to 100%; they cap at 90 whether you invest gear or perk cards. 
---
34 levels is laughable as a long term investment, main character is 220 and your idea would just make my already OP character unstoppable. Currently the trade off for endgame gear is weight reduction, sentinel or Cavaliers. How would taking out most of the useful legendary effects help build diversity? All that does is let everyone max out damage cards and take God gear with no penalties. 
---
By clicking on the CAMP icon on the map? *confused*
---
Thank you!  This is **exactly** what I needed.
---
3 is my max, I’ve never not crashed when I’ve hit 3.  
---
I wonder if your client was more stable without the other people on it?   Do you normally have this long of stable play? 
---
Pc/Xbox/ps? 
---
sadly not, it's been like that for close to a month now. I mean, I guess it isn't a particularly important mod so that's probably why they still haven't gotten around to fixing it up yet but my hopes are still high
---
VATS is the shit, wtf you talkin bout 
---
Another great tip! I'll reduce my junk down a bit.
---
People love to bitch and moan after they lose.
---
That translates to "water of life" and is legit the Irish word for whiskey :)
---
Uisce = Water
---
Beatha = Of Health (life) (It's a difficult language, this word can be interchangeable with Slainte, which actually means health but when we say it it means "Cheers" (your health!)).
---
You got banned?
---
Yeah sure, what’s your PSN?
---
Ultracite ammo types don't have their own plan you need to find. I want to say that all of the ammo plans unlocked after making it past a certain point in either the Brotherhood or Enclave part of the story. I know that I was able to craft every kind of ultracite ammo before I found any prime receiver plans, but I didn't even try to fight the Queen before I had finished the story. I would imagine finding the receiver plans before getting to that point unlocks the appropriate ammo type too.  The issue there, as you've found out, is that you can't see a list of the plans you already know. Hopefully they'll add that somewhere, as you're far from the first person who has gotten a prime receiver plan but not known what gun it was for.
---
Yup. One shotting isnt pvp, its unsportsmanlike behaviour. Everyone gets a fair shake ya know? Honestly im kinda hoping they dont allow legendaries (armor or weapons) in the pvp servers and the only advantage you can get is like a semi permanent or timed perk. Be way more interesting than a bunch of dicks with tse and stacked endurance bobbleheads running around like they own the place
---
Preaching to the choir...don’t have to sell me I bought a ticket decades ago 😉
---
Generally, melee is easier because it doesn't use ammo and with the right perks and SPECIAL points allocation, you'll be killing enemies an just a few hits and eventually OHOK.
---
Consider doing some mutation farming around level 31-32 to get some damage increase for melee but also so you can get Starched Genes 2 to make rhem permanent.
---
With 15 points in Strength, I recommend Blocker 3, Incisor 3, Martial Artist 3, and 1 or 2 levels of you melee perks cards (Slugger 2, Expert Slugger 2, Master Slugger 2). If you go unarmed you can just do Iron Fist 3.
---
Once you reach or surpass level 50, it is helpful to max out things like Glow Sight 3, Exterminator 3, to significantly increase your damage output against those enemies and so you can swap out those perks cards when you don't need them.
---
Keeping the jack of all things in mind, I do recommend max Lone Wanderer and some other perks that are helpful in most circumstances.
---
That's enough from me for now. Good luck!
---
So is it a good way for player to bait others to get easy caps killing them then?
---
Hunting for dots doesn't show anyone that is sneaking (and doesn't show anyone at all, if you happen to be wanted).
---
Weightless with deep pockets and reduced weight perks 
---
I know !!!  I just left the vault and this game is the most amazing i've ever seen ! GOTY for sure !!! 
---
What is your actual theory about why they are knowingly banning players that don’t deserve it. If you are right, there is a benefit to them. So what is it? 
---
Also, some of the creepiest shit you'll find in game.  Guaranteed.
---
yw! Hope it works out. 
---
not the bees!
---
Must be south since it’s the one with a crate, 2 safes and the star chest 🤘🏻
---
Why not somewhere where both new and old players go fairly often and isn’t that dangerous ie Charleston and Morgantown?? Just place a camp on some major roadway with some sign that offers trading.
---
Can you place stuff in resource collectors and water purifying tanks? If so, I’d just put all your junk in one of those and a sign directing people to partake of it if they want.
---
I myself have placed my camp outside of Helvetia (rping as a Swiss defender of the town) and often wait for other players to stumble onto Helvetia and assume combat with the local scorched so I can jump in and kill the scorched, bring the newbie to my camp and give them some of my known recipes/plans as well as usually the black powder pistol that spawns in Helvetia and some food and purified water. Building up trust so if Bethesda ever allows for factions to become a thing ill have enough people willfully join up
---
You know that lake near Top of the World where those three brahmin always are?  Yeah, I'm camped there for a reason...
---
Drop stuff off in the suitcases in front of the main entrance to the Whitespring. A lot of us have been using that location.
---
You misunderstood him.
---
This is done to some degree already. The blue suitcase by the wendor at the Watoga station. Especially  when somebody nuked the fissure site prime. Its rumored that it stays there for about two hours game time but i cant confirm that.
---
What console or are you PC?
---
I think some people don’t realize that these situations require a double block action. Many I have heard complain think “block for session” works entirely which doesn’t. On Xbox (not sure how the other platforms work) all they have to do is remember the target’s gamertag (Xbox) and go to their profile (easily accessed through “recent” too) and click “join game” and bam, they’re in the target’s new world. Rather the target should access the griefer’s profile through recent, block them there, return to game, select block for session and then server hop. Noting that all these actions must be taken against any other the other griefers accompanying the main asshat AND the target’s team members also need to take the same actions if they are going to continue to play together on the new server.  
---
Or attacks you lol
---
Why do you comment on something you have no clue about?  
---
Awesome right up and build!
---
Definitely going to change up my route.
---
Scrap anything you have weapon and armor wise that isnt legendary, sell any legendary you havent used and are holding onto cos "i might use it someday", bulk ALL your junk, keep 5 bulk of items you dont use often and 10 bulk of what you do use on the regs. Sell all excess bulks to vendors and get rid of the 20 various mines i know you have in your prison wallet goddamit 😂😂 theyre friggin useless unless you enjoy killing yourself. And, basically, be ruthless my old china. Youre in the wasteland now kiddo, theres no dolly mixtures here, just a bunch of grimey necked, blood soaked filthy casuals. Good luck 👍
---
Why would you defend it before testing in the first place? 
---
Ah, gotcha.  I suspected.
---
They could add in a beekeeping suit, mabey having bees in different biomes could produce different honey that has cool effects :D 
---
Unyielding - u can easily raise your cw if in a situation when needed 
---
Can you show us a screenshot of the email or however you were informed you were banned?
---
I got the same thing man. I submitted a ticket as well.
---
This not be helpful in your case but I understand this problem can happer with two shot weapons.
---
I think it's supposed to be fixed this week.
---
I would recommend selling them if you don’t use them. I always use my harvest to make vegetable starch for adhesive and then get all my spare chems, alcohol, clothes, and vegetables and go to the nearby vendor to sell them. Usually make off with about 100 caps easy
---
Grilled Radstag?  How else?
---
My wife and I sit in different rooms because she says fallout is for geeks and she prefers to watch Emmerdale. 
---
Games have mechanics that pit players against each other. Sometimes you lose.
---
You’re entitled to your opinion.
---
It’s my opinion that your summery judgment of another person’s character based on their behavior in Fallout 76 is that *you’re* garbage, so that’s that I guess.
---
Right on.  Pretty much was I was thinking.  What’s the best “base”? Leather, Marine, etc....??
---
Gain rads- u get 15 to strenght at low hp
---
If you keep power armor frames in your stash, equip it with pieces of power armor and a fusion core and then store it. Instead of having 60 weight from all the individual components, you’ll only have 10 from the frame.
---
Too late for my god role shotgun 
---
I roll with weightless deep pocketed ONLY to synergize with my chameleon mutation. 
---
3 2handed cards!!! Oh no I totally forgot avout expert and master cards of 2handed. Thanks a lot for pointing it out. I got some 6 levels to go through and obtain these cards at full rank. 
---
Yes, I did walk around somewhat. Unfortunately, the legendaries per hour is still the best at Whitesprings.
---
But the fact that I have to be very low on health sounds repelling to me and kind of risky. 
---
Well, I thought I had, but it turns out that human memory is a strange thing.
---
Do you rigourously test everything in game?
---
"Oh, I found a plan there once. I must now test this 200 times for consistency"?
---
Is that you?
---
Sorry, I don't understand the question. It just seems so fucking stupid, but maybe I haven't tested it.
---
True, but that in itself is still dependance on the trading subreddits 
---
If you log out wearing your Excavator set, you get the 100 lb bonus twice until you exit your power armor (or otherwise lose the bonus, such as by breaking a piece).
---
That would be cool. And then having a beehive in your camp has a random chance of attracting a honey beast to attack your camp would keep it interesting
---
Really up to what kind of resistances you want marine has base great everything other then that combat heavy varients are great as well.
---
Your replies seem the most reasonable, but where did you get your info from?
---
And do ALL armor types have the deep pocketed capability?
---
Oddly, it can't....it only goes with uisce :)
---
Cheers is "Slainte" (accent over the a, pronounced "slaw-in-t-ya")
---
Telling from their updates already, I’d be surprised
---
As said above. Might be fun if u joined up with someone. What platform are you on 
---
Yeah I believe so except enclave urban stuff if I'm not mistaken.
---
They said the account it’s locked until the next dupe fix (upcoming patch)
---
Top floor. Note called stolen supplies hidden like on the second shelf of a desk.
---
Almost have the code verified.
---
Get pharma farma Lvl 3 then raid the place. Ull get loads
---
Depends on your build but if your not specific type build I’d Say Furious or Instigating
---
Did you find it?
---
Heavy BoS Combat Armor gives the highest DR/ER, Scout Armor is second (but can't drop as legendaries other than one unique chest piece), and Marine Armor third, but gives more rad resist. Other armors can be better in one (Metal has high DR but low ER).
---
Depends on your build, on the gun, lots of things.
---
You can’t just give a cookie cutter answer for everything in this game, sometimes you actually gotta play it and learn stuff for yourself 😉.
---
He's not talking about what you're mentioning here at all. There's a distinct difference between booting my game up from standby and clearing my cache before I start. Things like frame rate stutter, lag, latency, etc can, key word can, be alleviated by doing this if only temporarily. All this guy is doing is trying to disseminate some friendly and useful information that some of us, especially the casuals, might not have. There's plenty of code based bugs to run Into, you don't need a clogged cache delaying transmission from client to server
---
I'm on PC, but it seems to me more console players have griefer issues in general. I've only ran into one real griefer group on PC and I've been playing since launch, and they were quite easily evaded. You don't have a gamertag or profile that needs any blocking on PC. It is strange that they let people join the games of non-friends on Xbox.
---
Lol if you wanna act like other online games don't go months without fixing issues the community has, go right ahead. Doesn't make it true lol
---
That's in 15 days damn, I have that issue too but I never duped any items.
---
That be the one. Lots of goodies there
---
If you read the entire thread he mentions nothing about Lagos or server client connections. He mentions bugs glitches which are not fixable by a simple reset.
---
Oh it’s by no means a given that the other corpses will populate loot. It’s just an observation I’ve made while playing. After I commented I killed 2 legendary ghouls (1* n 3*) at whitesprings. 1* dropped no loot. I attacked a 3* waited for health bar to recharge n killed it n it dropped a 2* troubleshooting metal chest. No other ghouls had any legendaries.  
---
1.  Is there any plan to make shielded lining available for casual underarmor? It's currently the only one I know of that doesn't negate the PA frame. Also I like the flannel shirt and jeans...
---
2. Twice now I've been part of a SBQ battle for at least 20 minutes on the timer. After she dies I go over to loot the body and it disapears. No meatpile or anything in the area to be looted.
---
3. Will we ever be able to lock items in our inventory?
---
4. Currently Awol Armaments seems to be the only activity that consitently drops max level legendary loot. I tried doing many, many other events even with 20 charisma and was still getting low level pieces and often just non legendary armor as rewards. It seems like most of the map and events are for players under lvl 50. I don't always have time to launch nukes and do SBQ and even when I do so far I only get loot about 30% of the time because of disconnects or her disappearing. I would love to see more lvl 50 plus events.
---
5. Please add paint for other armors in the Atom Shop. Maybe some spray painted raider graffiti for raider armor, some flat black (and I guess any other color people would like) for metal and robot armor, some othe colors like the combat helmet for combat armor. 
---
6. Make a ghillie suit and a ninja outfit for all the sneaky folks out there. (I don't play much stealth but I think it would be a hit. There's hardly any good camo armor or outfits in this game for how many fps types play it)
---
7. Lastly...PLEASE for the love of gaming....make 2-3* legendary enemies drop loot that matches their stars. WITHOUT decreasing their spawn rate. Nothing in this game has disappointed me as much as killing 3* enemies over and over and not even walking away with one useful item. I don't have the words to even describe the frustration. (I do but they are not appropriate)
---
Overall I just want to say I think this game has some great things going for it. I love the open world aspect, being able to build a camp almost anywhere, I love being able to switch between 1st and 3rd person, I actually enjoy the SBQ battles, I like being able to change out perk cards and go from a rifleman marine armor build to a heavy gun toting power armor wearing beast, I like that we can use vats or not, we can use cover like a fps but still stack effects like some other games. The team aspect and sharing perk cards is great and I think the menu is pretty user friendly once learned. I hope to be able to play this game for quite awhile.
---
Though if you see a plan you don't want leave it and hop servers. Don't take it or you'll have to wait 24 hours till loot respawns
---
Hunt power armors or capture a power plant. Hold a power plant for an hour and get 8 full cores
---
People upvote and downvote depending if they agree or disagree when the votes are a really meant for if it is relevant or not. I rarely downvote because the majority of the posts are always relevant meaning they deserve an upvote.
---
Are you using the targeting hud?
---
The number of hours one enjoys the game is related to the amount of imagination and complexity of thought one brings to the game.  The open field nature of Fallout has always provided an opportunity to create one's own mini-world adventures, goals and achievements aside from the quests and levels provided by the game.  So, once some people have finished the game-set challenges they are bored.  Others play on.................  (e.g. who plays solitaire, poker, monopoly, etc over and over)?
---
The Amount Blair train yard sometimes I've found as much as 3 around the whole area. If you're on Xbox I have a bunch I can give you, player name is Daddy Dracos
---
It is the oddest loot system I’ve ever encountered n considering how similar everything else is to fallout 4 you could assume the loot system would be similar as well
---
It's easy to exceed that cap. My thoughts is that even when crafting armor and repairing weapons, you'll still have a chunk left over when starting from 500. For springs I bulk to 50 and sell the excess.
---
I’m just going to comment here again with the question. If you are right and they are maliciously banning people on purpose that don’t deserve it. Why would they? It’s what you suggest, so you must have a theory.
---
I traded this shit in weeks ago
---
This happens a lot if you play at later hours and play for upwards of 3-4 hours plus. FO76's matchmaking prioritizes almost full servers so when multiple people leave, it can put that server so low on the que that more players leave than join. The game is still widely played so I dont see this changing any time soon and there are so many servers that this is bound to happen. 
---
It feel great though. No hastle. Farm what you want. All the enemies are your level or atleast scaled properly. I wish we could opt into doing this so we don't need to wait!
---
Rule 1
---
Capture both plants and fast travel free.  
---
If you are running a low health build, I’d drop demo expert, pick up nerd rage 3 and a bloodied gun if you can 
---
Noice. And what do you do with the (known) plans?  I've kept them because they appear to have value...
---
This reminded me of a similar situation. I had just got my x-01 PA and the jetpack mod, so I was flying around and found myself on a roof at the northern airport (I'm bad with names). I was going through some inventory when I hear the sounds of panic somewhere nearby. I close my menu and look down and see a level 6 being shot by all the scorched, yelling like a mad man and running from cover to cover until they downed him. I flew from the roof to where he was, revived him, and pulled out my .50cal. I unload into the scorched until they're all dead, turn to the level 6 and waved to him. He replied with "Holy fuck Ironman! That was awesome!". I don't think I've laughed harder while playing this game than that moment haha. 
---
I don't see anything on that, can you link it?
---
Damn I'm on ps4. thanks anyways though!
---
I dont use power armour. I never did like the view from inside the suit... they are all scrapped immediately.
---
&gt; if I dont get back on line by tonight I'm gonna talk to a fucking lawyer about this bullshit
---
lmao, no you're not
---
For example you could run gunsmith 3 and nerd rage 3 for a total of 6 intel, then put those other points into either defensive perks or dmg perks 
---
Yeah I've passed through that lake before..I think there's also another lake somewhere with ragstags. I'd camp there but I like the view of whitesprings from the top of the cliffs.
---
Consider that a full time job = 8 hours a day. Its more or less what Fallout 76 is to me. If i was working id probably have played like 6 hours per day everyday instead of 9-10. Still being paid full time hours by work though.
---
My mum keeps telling me to try make money through gaming so I wont need my job. ug4m seems kinda shady though.
---
I got mine from a cargo bot I shot down
---
This is a long shot: but if anyone would be so kind as to trade me the pieces for some caps or items, my ID is: legacys
---
Thanks all!
---
When I need cores I go through all the random PA sites, and grab the cores off them,  &amp; if space allows i might also take armour parts for a few bonus caps income too.
---
I normally work full time. Since ive been off work, gaming is essentially that full time job time waster. Before Fallout 76 I was hardcore into WoW and BFA. But yeah bfa kinda sucks... 
---
Honestly there’s only one place I could justify someone wearing a hazmat suit, and that’s in a nuked white springs and only because they don’t like PA but honestly even then I think it’s simply just stupid.
---
I run a bloodied build in regular armor. The queen event can be done outside the nuke zone very easily and there’s no need for a hazmat suit there. If it’s a white spring nuke which I rarely enter nowadays, I will wear my PA with the emergency protocols mod. In both my regular armor and PA I am a futuristic friggin Abrams tanks. Why would I give that up for a hazmat suit, or why would anyone honestly? Besides to gimp yourself that is, because that is all you’re effectively doing.
---
Doubt they will revert. They nerfed crit chaining on purpose. I would love it if they fixed sneak though and made it consistent.
---
Apparently, when they made vendors show all plans, they didn’t include the mod plans, or they didn’t increase the max items enough. So currently you can’t buy them. And you can’t scrap for them either (when you see it pop, it’s actually the paint for the combat helmet).  So we are all waiting unless someone happened to but they earlier
---
I can do arms, but not legs or chest. Haven’t gotten lucky enough to get it as a reward
---
And per the other comment Scout cannot be deep pocketed, correct?   If so, I should probably target HBoS or marine combat.  Is that right?
---
pretty certain that's the problem with fallout 76
---
I have radio off if I play, i have Spotify up. there's no immersion, I know, but st least I don't get bored of hearing "keep a smile on your face and your big mouth shut, HOORAY!"
---
I played from levels 30-200 as a sneaky sniper. My trusty Furious Prime Pipe Bolt Action Rifle with +1 agi and 25% faster fire rate. I would clear out west tek and other harder locations back then, but it would take much much longer. It was kind of more satisfying to do it as a sniper.
---
I didnt get my first explosive gun till level 200, but it completely changed my playstyle. It was a TSE harpoon gun, with fletchette mod its essentially a mega range shotgun. Just keep plugging at it, and stick to squishy enemies. Ghouls/Scorched die really quick.

---
Yeah, I mean I got 100 hours of playtime, so I'm not complaining there, but there are so many places on the map that seem big but there's nothing there but some junk to loot.
---
The neon letters don't require to be attached to a wire. Just ensure a conduit with energy supply is nearby and they should light up.

What I've been doing, especially for ammo I don't need, is leaping onto the counter in front of the Watoga vendor and dropping it all into a bag there.  Nice and obvious, can't miss it, and looks very deliberate.
---
Ahh I misread you’re post up there...TY for the correction (and especially the pronunciation...Gaelic is super hard for us dumb Americans to wrap our tongues around)
---
Spotify plug in
---
nuff said
---
Generally watoga has a ton of dog food too, look around in slocum joes, the tables scattered around the city, the hot dog carts. If you find a fresh server you can probably pick up like 25 cans or more.
---
I can mod legs and chest. But not arms. Haha
---
Ain't it a pain
---
Bruh I have like 30. Do the Battle Bot event every time you can. When you kill the sentry boy it drops one, and usually you get 2 in the reward.  Since I walk from my camp near Big bent Tunnel in the tracks to Welch, I pass multiple power armor spawns and generators
---
bloody hard for us dumb Irish as well, you may be sure :)
---
Someone on this sub put together a 1200 song list from all of the fallout games and others that fit the genre.  I pull it up on shuffle when I play and it’s very immersive.  Check it out if you’d like.  It’s not mine but it’s good!

even still.... I am certain ( as an aussie) even in America, music tastes /, playlists on radio stations change dependant on the area you live 
---
Speaking of random spawns, what is the deal with spots that have dead brahmin all over?  I was half expecting a deathclaw or mothman to spawn but it's usually nothing.
---
Things you may or may not know. 
---
Your weight reduction perks don't work in the stash. So. If you have the food or chem reduction perks maxed out, don't store those items. You're better off carrying them all since they'll weigh next to nothing in your personal inventory. 
---
Make sure you scrap all junk before you stick it in your stash. Double check the junk in there as some items don't auto scrap down all the way; hardened mass, etc.
---
Store power armor on a frame so it weighs less. If you have pieces that are too high level, set the frame down, transfer the pieces onto the frame, then just wait for the frame to float back into your inventory. Then just stash it.
---
Bulk things! Then sell off the extra bulk you won't use.  Make sure you're hitting every vendor you can. You may want to Google the vendor map just  incase you don't understand how the shared cap pool works, or where the unique vendors are.
---
Check your misc tab. Sometimes you wind up with a lot of ore that needs to be smelted, or an ungodly amount of gunpowder. 
---
Check your ammo and dump the types you don't use. 
---
And be excited, we get a stash increase soon! 
---
Honestly? I just enjoy the game. VATS specifically. I am god awful at FPS games. Truly the worst. I cannot aim for beans. VATS lets me play an FPS game in a way that perfectly suits me. Plus I always liked the idea of playing an MMO style game from day 1 and going super hard. Loving the game helps.
---
cheers cobber, I will suss it out later tonight
---
Lot of people experiencing this including people I know for a fact have not duped.. who knows 🤷‍♂️
---
Daisycutter comes with the MIRV mod, so each nuke does only 150, but there's 3 of them that cover a wider area.  You can swap out the mod with a standard one and get it up to 450 single target.
---
PC
---
Ive got 267 action points. Usually it takes 6-7 seconds to go from no AP to full AP. I use Lone Wanderer 3 and 3 pieces of AP refresh on my gear.
---
What are you spec’d for?
---
I mostly only have some halfway-decent, but always looking to help someone out esp. if they have something I can use. Happy to share. Best I have so far from a random pull is a melee which I use all the time on one character, so that’s nice - but I understand the pain of not having anything decent.
---
Seriously though, a single decent * on a gun that matches your build and the world will change.
---
Idk about what you classify as a bug or a glitch but I'm pretty sure frame rate drops, latency issues like when you shoot a scorched but they shoot like 2 more times before their head pops off, are in the same category. Same severity, of course not, for a lot of people they can just power through the little hiccup, but some people can't stand that stuff and it detracts from their enjoyment of the game. Isn't that what a bug is? An unintentional issue that prevents someone from enjoying the game as much as they'd like to
---
The only bad thing is I have 25k caps and I can't bring myself to drop them 
---
Server hop until your eyes bleed. 2 times i got them when not looking for them, just on vendor runs.
---
Are you going alpha, or multi-shot?  If alpha avoid Furious, obviously - you want something like AA or TS or Instigating (and that even changes on the weapon type and if you’ve got some built in armor reduction from a perk).
---
Bloodied is really only for those who’ve planned for it (and many have) - for those guys it’s pretty much tops.
---
/u/sdyorkbiz /u/gh0st1walk3r Add me, let's all sort something out! My ID is: legacys
---
Would really appreciate it.
---
Yup. Most days I'll find a couple. Usually its crap that i either vendor or dont even pick up. 3\* lead pipes, rippers, reduced fall damage armor etc
---
I probably find a good usable legendary that I add to my mule once every few days. But I am at an extreme gear level, what i deem usable is very different to others.
---
They do/did get the loot. While I was lower leveled, before I even had a decent weapon to my name,  I would set up my camp as a mobile turret station near harder enemies (wendigo, snallygasters, super mutant hoards etc). Never at whitespring, but anywhere around the map. I could safely stand inside if I was getting killed, and collect all loot once the turrets took care of things... even from enemies I never hit. I would miss out on xp, but still get the rewards. I haven't done this in a while, so maybe it was patched out. It functioned this way from beta, until the last time I tried it in December/January. Try it somewhere.
---
Blue suitcase in the Watoga train station.
---
Register inside Whitespring; ice chest near the golf course / club house.
---
Sometimes people drop things in the little sack by the Whitespring train station.
---
Those general locations (Watoga and Whitespring) are most useful for the vendor density and relative proximity to farming / content. 
---
Truly just love the combat style. I suck at shooter games and VATS lets me not suck at fallout. That combined with the infinite grind style and I'm hooked. I really just find the game super fun. And I've always wanted to be playing an mmo style game from day 1 and going super hard.
---
Thanks, good to know, I dumped all my mini nukes(like 18 of them) in the bag next tonthe crafting table at White Springs station a week.or two ago to save weight in my stash so I haven't actually fired it yet, just noticed it appeared to be substantially less damage than the regular fatman I just picked up when I was comparing them, but that explains it.  Hopefully I didn't sell it off, I'll have to look in my stash next time I'm on.
---
Poseidon power plant workshop has a fusion core generator  I claim it everytime I'm on and usually get a bunch of cores. Right now I'm sitting on probably 20 or more just from that. 
---
If your on ps4 i can mod every piece and give deep pocketed as well.  Let me know
---
There are 2 terminals in the upstairs of the masion, there should be info diamonds on both of them on both of them
---
Don't get me wrong, my experience coding is minimal, it was a hobby when I was in highschool, so no expert here. I, and OP I'm sure, agree there are tons of issues that can only be fixed by Bethesda or the modding community(hopefully). This post wasn't meant to sell snake oil to people but I definitely notice less lag, less FPS drops, and far less disconnects when I'm running around with a cleared cache. that's all he's trying to communicate
---
Oh so kind! Such a shame i'm on PC. Thank you so much for offering though. How lovely of you. Thank you.
---
I'm a PC User to note\*
---
First thing I do is go to bed and play the piano.
---
If I'm low on Canned Dog Food, I'll make a ton of Corn Soup instead.  Super Duper makes that easy and then the food/water is pretty much sorted out.
---
Vendor runs.  I'm basically equidistant from Watoga, R&amp;G, Whitesprings, and Harper's Ferry.  I like to deal with Watoga first, because people tend to sell their Legendaries there.  Ideally, if I'm trying to sell excess goods I already have on me, I want to hit the BoS vendor and Harper's Ferry first because the lack of nearby Stash boxes is kind of obnoxious.
---
With the weight situation sorted out, I kind of do whatever.  I look for Events.  I look at the Daily challenges.  I look for newbies and think about crafting something for them.  I look for people out in the middle of nowhere because you can find some interesting CAMPs.  I look for bounties.  Or I just take the long way to a destination and see what I bump into.
---
wow. 50 caps per for stable? that's an incredible deal.
---
It's a pity I won't be near my console for a while
---
Cripple the wings and they land pretty quickly.
---
I was on my level 25 alt in whitesprings and got assaulted by 2 level 80 SBs. I killed both on my own. Using Fireproof rank 3 and a dense mod on my chest, the sonic blast does no damage.
---
Eventually they landed and 2 MIRV grenades killed each scorchbeast. Just gotta think outside the box. Explosives are really powerful.
---
No that's server side issues not client
---
The Drifter Outfit, Black Prospector's Hat and Eyeglasses is what I finally settled on. Unfortunately, I sold the Drifter Outfit by accident, thanks to the damn trade dialogue not showing what you have equipped under power armor consistently. So, for the moment I'm using the Pastor's Vestments. Not my favorite look, but it's what I've got for now.
---
No, it's just that 99% of you are so strongly opposed to organizing anything fun that this is all we're left with. Join me sundays.

So your name is McSaltMaker and you're here posting about unverified bans and twitter outrage...

Yeaaa no ty. :P

I'm looking into trading... I'm seeing a few articles on trading causing a flag. I gave my son and his new character a bunch of junk and made him a few weapons which filled up his stash yesterday, no star weapons and he can't login either. 
---
Scout *can* be deep pocketed, but it's a royal pain in the ass. I had my set deep pocketed, and then switched to ultra-light (better for stealth builds).

The issue with modding scout is that it can only be done with mods (not plans), and the mods can only be purchased from the Armory MODUS in the Enclave Bunker. To make matters worse, it doesn't specify which piece of the armor (legs, arms, chest) the specific mod for sale is in the name. It will just say "Scout Armor Ultra-Light". It took me an entire week of server hopping after work to get Polymer and Ultra-light on all 5 pieces. The cherry on top is that you also can't get Scout in Legendary. So...yeah, avoiding Scout is avoiding a headache :).
---
When trying to get a set of legendary heavy combat armor you have to pay attention to the DR/ER, because it doesn't tell you it's heavy in the name. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/WR1j0x2) is a handy chart that can help with that, if you plan on buying from other players. You'll need it modded to BoS to get the best DR/ER. 
---
Marine Armor is straightforward, only comes in one variant (no light/sturdy/heavy). I find there are a lot more 3* Weightless pieces available than there are heavy combat. You'll want it modded to Buttressed to get the best DR/ER.
---
Hop that helps!
---
Lone Wanderer requires 2 points for the base perk. So 4 charisma total for rank 3. My build is incredibly honed. Its for looting almost no items and 100% about farming quick and efficiently. I only have 2 unspent perk points right now. I constantly tweak the build.
---
There are no issues with hardware is the point.
---
Power up Poseidon, claim forest workshops for fusion cores and Salisbury steaks and black titanium. Maybe complete some quests, kill a bunch of super mutants. Do a few daily events while exploring new and old areas. 
---
Well crap. I had 5 in my stash, and one on me. I wanted to turn them in, but logged out forgetting about it. Now I go and they’ve combined to one. What a glitchy waste
---
Oof that is terrible. Been there. I feel your pain 
---
I don't think "pedantic" is the word you're looking for, but okay. 😉
---
I like the base soundtrack too, although it's become repetitive after so many hours.
---
Having 140 pounds if my stash taken by just springs sucks lol but I did it to myself so oh well
---
Nvuu v
---
Then why are you still here?
---
That's where I started to lose interest and motivation. I'm getting ready to try again though. We'll see what happens this time. 
---
OP u can get the 3* from the market subs..I don't even think it sells for that much
---
The generally agreed on place for excess unsalable items of quality in the endgame  --especially post SBQ fight-- is the Blue Suitcase in Watoga Station. That suitcase is frequently full of known plans, known recipes, one star wood and leather armor and various bits ammo and junk. Sometimes people will get creative and use the lunch box next to it or the toolbox by the pinball machine or the news stand out front, or maybe even just a doggie bag in the shadows by the Stash box. But 'Watoga Station' is the general repository for crap you don't want and can't sell but might be useful to someone else.
---
That said, I try to treat Watoga like a 'take a penny, leave a penny' box. Yeah okay I'll take the .308 ammo, but I'm gonna drop off my excess fusion cells and .45 ammo in return. It's also probably a good idea not to take anything you don't intend to use, so maybe not take all the leftover weapons and armor and do a vendor run with it.
---
Now that's for endgame stuff. If you've got leftover chems like Stimpacks, RadX and Rad Away or low level weapons and armor it's best to leave that for the noobs. The Overseers Stash at her CAMP is a good place as well as Charleston Station.
---
But a good wildcard place to leave neat stuff you'll never use is, IMO, Whitespring Station. There doesn't seem to be an agreed upon place like the Watoga Suitcase, but I've found stuff in the Sack by the Tinkerer's Bench, the filing cabinet and the desk, the news stand by the Stash Box and sometimes just a doggie bag in the middle of the room. Heck I even dropped off an extra half a set of Raider power armor I accidentally picked up. 
---
Madman doesn’t even sell them for big caps
---
Bethesda Twitter account is getting hammered by the same error. They tell you to submit a ticket and here is what has happened to a few:  
---
1. You're playing the BETA and it ended, please buy the game
---
2. Hard reset your console to clear the cache
---
3. reinstall the game
---
4. you've been banned after all the above  
---
Here is there feed: [https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/with_replies)
---
If you're in pacifist mode, you can't damage someone else's camp already, as i understand it. But I haven't used range weapons consistently in awhile, so maybe that's different? 
---
I am sorry that happened to you though. If you need anything and you're on PC, let me know. Im actually a bit surprised by the whole thing. When I clear bounties, I don't take anything. I'm level 160ish? I don't need anything. Stealing someone else's junk at such a high level seems petty. 
---
It's kind of fun to look back on the trailers and recognize where the different locations are.
---
You can have and store a death claw in your camp?! How? 
---
Post saved haha WOOF WOOF
---
It was the fairly generic one posted around. Can't post pics here. It was in response to a support ticket. So had I not opened a ticket I'd still be trying to get in.
---
I like this
---
Do you think approaching the business practices of Bethesda with a skeptical mind set should be considered a characteristic in line with paranoia?
---
I love fo4! Fo76 has given my husband and I the opportunity to play fo together as a team. Which I kinda wish they had for fo4.
---
We need to be able to toglle on/off a shortlist or favorited list of perk cards to make swapping out easier. 
---
And you know what? It's the best damn milk you'll ever gonna drink. 
---
I swear I'm closing on at least 150. It's driving me mad.
---
Tried 1s, 2s and 5+,no difference, always just water/ammo.
---
 Keep the faith brother! 
---
Right, maybe with a ranking system with weekly rewards. 
---
Honestly i don't see the reason to fight with other players this way
---
If you read the linked Twitter feed this is what has been happening from players. Quite a few players experiencing this. 
---
Firest camo is cool but by far least rare and coolest outfit in the gane fir that wasteland feel is the drifter
---
R/Market76?  Got a line out, but no bites so far.  
---
I ALWAYS wear Felt Antler Horns, Fashionable Sunglasses and a Slave Collar. And my outfit is usually Manta Man or the White Tuxedo.
---
I'll see if i can add photos to the op.
---
What has eluded me is a good TSE gun. Ive only had 1 drop and Mama Dolce's ate it.
---
I'm also still discovering stuff about some locations. Like did you know Sugar Grove has a back entrance that has some cool lore. I only discovered it a few days ago.
---
No. It wont spoil. 
---
Wasteland whisperer allows you to tame and pet deathclaws
---
This is a fantastic analogy. Thank you! 
---
Thanks for the reply. Very helpful.
---
Yeah, I am always on the lookout for a bloodied lever, Bolt Action Pipe, or hunting... I don’t have the trade capital to get one though and nobody is accepting caps. Never had  bloodied rifle drop either—but ideally I’ll get one to replace the Instigating. 
---
Wow thanks! Is there nothing better to do with spare ammo? Dumping it seems like a waste.
---
Regular drifter? Yeah I like that too..I've still yet to see the whitespring jumpsuit
---
For sure! Maybe give us a “perk set” option. Letting us switch out sets of them for fighting and then swapping to a set for crafting ammo or repairing. 
---
Awesome. Thank you. 
---
I’ve seen a few people float around the paragon level concept (account levels vs character lvls) and I think using that for stash based perks would be nice.  Every X account levels you can apply perk cards to your stash for weight reduction.  
---
You are underleveled for that area of the game.  Ideally, at Lv. 23, you're mostly doing stuff in Toxic Valley and starting to move into the Ash Heap.  The gloves come off as you move east.
---
There are times when this becomes annoying (the way so many quests congregate at Top of the World, for example), but to me, it was thrilling to be outmatched sometimes.  If it's not other players, then it's Scorchbeasts.  There will come a point when you are strong enough to rise above it all, and you'll look back at the things that gave you trouble and laugh.
---
That’s pretty awesome you get to play with you kid
---
Wish they would do right and get this game to work 
---
I found 2 of them took about 18 hours of server hopping
---
Yes maybe have a ranking system for daily and weekly and also have atom rewards so the rewards cant be used to get a leg up on other players in the sense of being able accumulate caps to trade for better gear. Idk just spit balling.
---
Usually thats my experience. 20ish minute respawn rates. If they havent respawned i check my other spots and check again 5 minutes later. And thats only if i know its a good server.
---
Go to r/fo76bazaar for markets and trading 
---
Yeah. Whitespring is basicly a caddy jumpsuit if your into that kinda thing
---
But Reddit isn’t bethesda or zenmax.  
---
I don’t know why you’re experiencing authentication issues, but I’m just not sure going to social media to compel a software manufacturer about a specific service desk issue is the most efficient way at resolution.
---
The Route I take is Flatwood (responders) -&gt; Sutton Station (raider) -&gt; Whitespring -&gt; Enclave -&gt; Watoga Station (unique) -&gt; Watoga Shopping District (BOS) -&gt; Harper's Ferry (free states)
---
If you encounter Grahm the traveling merchant with the cow pet. he's cap total is linked with the unique faction.
---
Cap totals for vendors reset every 20 hours.
---
Enclave bunker access is through the quest progression.
---
Watoga Shopping district the robots that patrol the area will attack you unless you do a quest. It is entirely possible to stealth through to the vendor and sell, but sometimes you find yourself having to kill off a grip of robots to do so in peace.
---
Harper's ferry is probably the trickiest because enemy spawn rate is pretty quick. If you have the travel point, it'll place you where the train tracks split off. Go straight up the middle between them and you should see a car and a building with a hole through the wall. Go through the wall, navigate through the doorway then it's a straight shot ahead at the end of the allyway. 
---
 But how do you save them so they stay forever 
---
Thats just one of the random encounters. Normally theres 1 lone Opossum among the brahmin corpses. So my assumption is that its more than just a simple Opossum.
---
PVP isn’t meant for only work shops. So therefore they’re not using it wrong. I’m not encouraging this kind of behavior or anything. All I’m saying is think about the decisions you make if you don’t want to be involved in PVP. Don’t claim workshops. Don’t invite strangers to your CAMP. Definitely don’t claim a workshop and then hang out at your CAMP, which is what he did. He opened himself up to PVP and then sat at his CAMP. 
---
Go back to griefing people kid.
---
That's why you have to lure your opponent into a false sense of security. Low health build makes them think, oh this person is a one shot, but I have every defensive perk and good armor, so I'm not a one shot. Thanks for the caps. Hehe.
---
Good bot
---
Everyone sounds like they are getting all of those responses and in that order lol
---
Technically anything done with ill intent to another player is pvp aka "player vs player" so one shotting someone else is indeed pvp.
---
Watoga runs keep me topped up. There are four power armor frames and a generator. The Firebase by the Fissure Site nearby to the southeast has one too.
---
Its a good trap to catch inexperienced players but if they have knowledge of builds they will know whats up haha
---
Tse are not top tier anymore either and bobbleheads were never effecting pvp.
---
This way is the best. I have around 40 cores from holding the power plant. You can also get lead, concrete, uranium or and aluminium ore. 
---
&gt;Weight reduction caps out at 90%. I have all weight cards maxed. I have 5 piece sets of all types of weight reduction gear which add up to 100%; they cap at 90 whether you invest gear or perk cards.
---
Okay, then that would be a problem.
---
I propose better armor effects worthy of legendary armor. There's a bunch of effects from previous Fallout games that could make a return, or they could create new ones. 
---
&gt;34 levels is laughable as a long term investment, main character is 220
---
And every level up after 50 was meaningless. 
---
&gt;Currently the trade off for endgame gear is weight reduction, sentinel or Cavaliers. How would taking out most of the useful legendary effects help build diversity? 
---
You had just claimed 95% of the legendary armors would be ruined by my change, and all I'm really doing is making items weigh less. If weight reduction is the overwhelmingly favored trait instead of reduced damage, then it doesn't sound like the armor end game is very balanced or diverse right now. 
---
The extremely limited carry weight in Fallout 76 is a major issue that should be addressed.
---
Most players are not going to be dedicated or lucky enough to hunt down every 3 star weight reduction legendary they can find just so the game is bearable.  Many of us are trapped in our Excavator suits. 
---
My solution would work, but I do admit they would have to tweak some of the armor effects.
---
Wait, where is this?
---
Go run Line in the Sand.
---
You can buy from one of the vendors. I think the one in the ski lodge. Maybe not the flux one, but one to work on at least. Shrug
---
Go to the Whitepsrings golf club and scrap all the golf clubs for mods, then you can craft it from a regular golf club
---
Right!!! I feel for you man I really do. They did a video on you tube where it says that it never stacks!! OMG I almost lost my shit I’ve been running strings of 20, 40 even more !! It doesn’t matter it’s always the same shit -water and stimpacks maybe ammo and scribes outfits Wtf!!!i can’t even get the paint when it’s offered!!  I had a guy on here  yesterday that said  he had paint plan to give and never showed up to the meet lol!!! I can’t even get this fucking paint if my life depended on it !!!
---
900 hours. I respect the dedication but jesus when you play a game that works to gonna think you traveled through time and space. 
---
That's what I've been reading! lol It looks automated via Twitter to submit a ticket or copy and paste replies with no answers ultimately saying to reply in the ticket.   
---
The BETA one is the best... not sure who is trying to use that...ha!
---
I am currently running a low-health build with 6 Intelligence.   Nerd Rage 3 plus 3 for either Demo Expert or Stabilized, depending on load-out.   Demo Expert is no longer worth much.   And Gunsmith is unnecessary except when crafting.   
---
Supposedly, this will be fixed in Patch 6 this week.
---
Got a screenshot? I need to see this.
---
3-5 minutes to load into game and let world load so i can see enemies, clear whitesprings golf club in 1min or less, loot, exit repeat. until i get my dream weapon (bloodied explosive handmade), doing anything else is pointless. Currently level 202.
---
cause i might spend money if there was anything remotely cool in there. Some ok hats, but they should be in the base game.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this all out.  Don't listen to the haters. &lt;3 I'm a stay at home mom and I spend maybe an hour a day on with my husband when he's home from work.  It's our relaxing time together before bed.  
---
Sorry, meant syncopate, but came out pedantic. I get mixed up some times.
---
I keep saying this but: Hasil Adkins.
---
" His spirited, unusual lifestyle is reflected in his music. His songs, which he began recording and distributing locally in the mid-1950s, explored an affinity for chicken, sexual intercourse, and decapitation, and were obscure outside of West Virginia until the 1980s. " ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasil_Adkins))
---
I'm not sure what's going on, I loved Fallout 4 and I've played this since BETA even though it crashes all the time or disconnects from server.   
---
Between updates/patches I think we all have downloaded like 300GB plus! lol  
---
If people are duping then that's on them but I also see a lot of people buying and trading with other players so not sure how they police it all.   
---
I get deleting the items but banning players that haven't done the copying or dupping? 
---
Vendor runs, knocking out daily/weekly challenges, farming legendaries, and distributing the spoils to the Watoga train station suitcase, Whitesprings crafting room cash register, and Flatwoods Overseer's Cache. Exploring/events, too, but only when the rest has been covered.
---
I posted about my end game CAMP and loop just the other day, check it out!

No new content.
---
If you had more than 1 copy of a god roll legendary you're only have one left. 
---
Plans and recipies now tell you if you know them, and vendors always have their plans in stock no need to server hop.

You haven't missed much March is when content is supposed to start

Click-bait.

My toad’s been long dead, RIP mr toady, but his 10% ghost is still around.

I'm trying shotgun build with another rifle for long tickets.
---
It's not OP but fun
---
Server hop enough and you'll find it for sale for like 400 caps in the Enclave armory my friend.
---
Alright let’s hope.
---
Let me know if in patch 6 this week it gets fixed, very interested in having a pet but saddened by the bugginess of it
---
Some of the mods in this game are pretty clever and cool, such as putting a fucking flamethrower on a pitchfork
---
Those are great to trade. They might be worth some good junk to the right player. 
---
Well what did you think those cans of beef stew were made of?
---
İ tried it like 10 hour and didnt found it
---
Not his exact words...but Eminem already did
---
What deathclaw? I always get a glowing radstag and a regular right next to the club, then randomised other creatures by the fountain, between the club and grounds. I'm level 80 something, do I have to be 91+ for it to spawn? Those bastard 68 charred ghouls had no trouble spawning well below 60
---
Woah plans and recipes now finally tell if you know them?! YESSS. No more infinite copies of me mistakingly picking up the same recipe. Never had a god roll legendary, so that's not too big of an issue. 
---
Good to know, I won't feel so in the dark as I thought I would be. Maybe I'll try a melee/automatic build just incase this time so I'm not left using a 1000 bullets on one supermutant lmao. 
---
"I got another idea for post- apocalyptic weaponry"
---
'okay, shoot'
---
"alright, what if, and hear me out, what if we take a pitchfork and add flames to it?"
---
'holy crap, like the devil?'
---
"LIKE THE DEVIL"
---
'that's metal af' 
---
They also nerfed two shot and explosive weapons as well, but sounds like that wing effect you to much
---
Some are getting this: BETA is over you must buy Fallout 76. This is from a PS4 user  
---
 https://twitter.com/DarthIxion/status/1097236494970904576 
---
If you know where the static spawns of power armor are, those tend to be good sources. An old reliable is the raider armor at the gorge junkyard (beside the junk pile deposit there's a semi trailer with a level 3 lock). 
---
As others have said, making a trip to a power plant is good. If you see that it's already claimed and set up to generate cores, make a note of it. If it goes to unclaimed it might be because of a disconnect or the person logged off. I claimed a recently unclaimed location and netted 7 cores off of it.
---
If you have caps to burn and get desperate you can straight up buy cores at the enclave military wing vendor
---
Yeah wouldn't go down very well because everyones snowflake sensitive when really were all rotting bags of meat in the end. But I'm pretty sure the song is what it implies been in a few fallouts I believe.
---
wow, so 2 people.....errrr  children, showed up.  one popped in, said "fo76 sucks!!!" and immediately left.  then another shows up, sounded like a 12 year old crying.
---
Sorry, don't have any pics at the moment, the wikis doesn't have any pics either.
---
I have not found it either. I'll pay 1501 caps for it. ;)
---
And save a set for quick swap
---
If you are walking from the resort to the golfclub it's in the field where u see two toxic soot flowers and other flora..it's the same place where a honey beast or radscorpion or grafton monster will spawn..if it doesn't spawn..server hop til it does
---
This as well as the majority of the comments make me feel that I'm playing it wrong. I had to look up TSE, I have not found a TS let alone an E. I'm lvl.55, over- encumbered unless in Excavator Armor and chronically low on fusion cores so not in Power Armor all the time. White Springs confuses me and I just get clobbered by hoards of charred which I can take out but lose my ammo. Westek has not spawned a legendary for me, ever but I do like sitting up on the rocks above and sniping the mutants. I've not played in a team ( well once, early on in the games first week a couple of stoned out their mind players followed me around through the forest ) but, I'd love it if someone would adopt me for a couple hours, show me some ropes. Ps4 georgepluck
---
Takes 5 seconds to Google it, bro 😁
---
Just tag em
---
I rarely sell anything as the vendors are always out of money! 
---
Oh come on i ask first 😂
---
moderator, can you please delete this post?  it has nothing to do with fo76 and is trying to promote their youtube channel.  thanx.
---
I never have that issue 
---
yup
---
I’ll add you tomorrow, be fun to playing without someone else 
---
Drop them in the blue suitcase in Watoga. If they're basic plans drop them in the Overseer's Camp Stash. Other options include Whitespring Station.
---
pc.  after this latest patch, my game has improved, stability wise.
---
I am level 121 play about 6 hours a day and never found one yet I brought one off of some person and I have all perks and still only do 230 damage which sucks
---
that is already my schedule bud!!  lol. 
---
I'll visit a vendor and they'll have 200 caps. Hours later, still no caps after I've traded. How often does it refresh?
---
Awesome. Simply awesome.
---
Would you take time out to inspire/explain the best thing to  a sniper build? 
---
Playstation 4
---
The harpoon gun does not give the sneak attack notification. 
---
I was about to lose my cool because this character was built around stealth harpoon gun.
---
It is giving the damage multiplier but not the notification.
---
Honestly if I ever encounter that problem I’d either go to a different vendor or just log out and log back in to go into a different server
---
Pretty obvious that it's about sex. 
---
Don’t you get the fear free when you complete various stages of the responder quests?
---
Somebody needs to get fired for that
---
The comment you are replying to seems to have been deleted. My list of games goes back to SNES/Genesis era so I know you weren’t referring to my list which is extensive.
---
Nah, but most of everyone who has posted on social media have also submitted a ticket, like myself. 
---
DUDE I LOVE YOU, YOU'RE THE BEST!!, check your private messages.
---
This is my take on the current state of the game. Catering to pvp players rather then the fallout fan base. They should have put more resources into build mode and pve/co-op with a pvp faction mode sometime down the road.  
---
Happening A LOT more since the last update 
---
Also greenhouse structures 
---
I’ve deleted it for you but was intended as an invitation to group.
---
It was a link to a Fallout 76 RP group - the Discord server was linked in the videos.
---
Hope you found your team mates.
---
I enjoy the game a lot, spent another 8 hours playing it today. But the bugs are insane. I wish Bethesda just gave themselves another year to get it ready before release.
---
I will add you and message you. I need a quick service. 
---
PS: CYBERHAWK IS A LEGEND
---
I've come across several high level players recently offering to trade. I accept the invite and realize immediately I've just advertised my junk.
---
Recently, these players have immediately exited the trade off and instantly kill me, taking my junk and fast travelling to the next sucker.
---
I don’t care what it’s about, it’s hilarious 😂😩
---
LOL Too funny. Good heads up.
---
Leader of the pack (it'll be wolves lvl 5-10) quest by Tyler County Fairgrounds is how I soloed the commendation. Each "leader" wolf is a legendary and you take out three.
---
The other option is to head into nuked/unnuked whitesprings and tagging the legendaries.
---
You forgot to mention that it needs 100 power to start the fusion core manufacturer. So plop a fusion generator down and attach it rather than start up the power plant. The core manufacturer also has a limit of 3 so every 25 minutes or so go back and grab your 3.  
---
Nope, just playing as usual. I don’t even know how to dupe. It’s weird that two times were right as I shot enemies in the head. But the rest were unrelated.
---
And planters for indoor planting.  
---
Gear
---
I really wanna see it
---
Last night two where engaged in a pvp for the workshop in Poseidon,  I waved at both and proceed to get the cores while they where busy. 
---
I also repaired a couple of turrets.. just for fun. 
---
Lol we had that happen yesterday. The game was a ghost town.
---
Doesn't bode well
---
I agree there. New Vegas is my favourite but the amount of times I’ve had to unplug the console and reset is crazy on that game. Even this year, you’d think all this time after the bugs would have been fixed.
---
I'll see if logging out and in works...
---
Thx
---
Just saying, you can probably buy it for 500 caps. Don’t get scammed 
---
RNG, it's just random baby.
---
1. Complete responder quest
---
2. There are lots of police unifoirms to be found
---
3.  I recall that one of the first uniforms I found was a paramedic uniform
---
4. In white springs there are several clothing stores in the basement
---
You listened to the tape left by Taggerty from the Glassed Cavern and opened up her office on the 4th floor of the Asylum? Her terminal is where the plans are. 
---
If they have missile turrets then finding their generator and taking it out is the way to go.
---
No, I don't think so 
---
Have Chest and Arms myself.  Need Legs.  Hoping the patch next week fixes it.  
---
Server hop ammo factory or that base near the fissure prime with the missile launcher
---
And a Jacuzzi.
---
Sadly, no. but I hope they'll return in the near future.
---
Probably weightless if u want to carry items. I have a weightless modded marine chest piece I could sell you if u want. I’m on Xbox tho 
---
I kno where these are if u have trouble finding them
---
That's how I thought it was at first. Each new stash box plan gave you x amount of weight or store only certain items like the refridge only holds food, chem box holds chefs, draws hold appeal ect.
---
Quite a few players who don't know what actually happened and assume it's bans, like you're doing?
---
If ur xbox mate I can mod ur legs lol. Maybe just gimme materials 
---
Where can you find the clean white asylum worker uniform if it exists? I’m a collector too lmao
---
It seems to be the common CS support responses overall or lack of. 
---
You get the armour as a reward for completing that quest where you fight the scorchbeast in the cave, so you should have it. However it only shows up in your inventory as power armour frame. Check it, the weight should be zero. Place it down and there it is, the full set (and now has weight!).
---
It is very easy to scrap it by accident, many people have done so. Same with the raider set you get from Rose (I had mine sitting in my stash for long enough before I realised there was a full set on it).
---
If you have scrapped it don't worry. Go back to fort defiance and go back into Taggardys quarters. You can get the plans to make a new set from the terminal. This was brought in recently as many were scrapping in error.
---
While making it is a nuisance as you have to hint for mats, you need to do this anyway - the reward set needs repaired anyway so youd be doing this regardless.
---
👍
---
Yup that's it
---
I know where they all are it's just a pain running around gathering them all.
---
I'm sure it is. You have fun with "all" your games.
---
I've just dropped off all known plans in the overseer camp. Feels good.
---
Thanks. Not sure how I missed that. Have been in there. 
---
Very very true
---
Same thing as Fusion.
---
I think it would be cool to limit stash items to different types, but then I thought this would be simpler to implement.
---
There's a Sentry bot corpse along the road leading up to the robco building, the one with the 'convoy', it spawns with a core. a lot of good scrap there too. The BoS Events give cores as well sometimes, 1-3 cores for the Line in the Sand and the Distant Thunder Event.
---
Other than that check the PA frame spawns and Fusion Generators. Even though I've only found 2 maybe 3 with a core in it since they 'fixed' it.
---
Can we fix the base game before you add indoor planters please. But yeah I'm on board for the indoor planters...especially that one of my char has herbivore.
---
They added that in one of the recent updates. Helped me and my buddy too. 
---
No problem. 
---
I can use them for power armour?
---
So combat is better than marine but marine is more straight forward in that it comes in the one tier?
---
So if I understand right, I should be looking for some any version of Unyielding or Weightless Combat or Marine armor and then I can get mods to beef them up to Heavy/DP’d?
---
I feel like I’ve got a bit of a handle on how to beef up my weapons but still a bit clueless on armor advancing.  
---
&gt; Jankjank
---
Glad you liked it. :)
---
No, plasma cores are used as ammo for the Gatling plasma
---
I'm sorry, I'm only on PC
---
Gatling plasma guns for one. 
---
And yes, that is WILDLY HELPFUL!!  Thank you!
---
Also should let you break down a card, so if it’s rank 3 and you’re trying to move points around, you can split it back up 2/1 or 1/1/1. Something like that.
---
Thank you so much dude. I cannot express my thanks enough. Just, thank you. Oh my god.
---
Should be able to.
---
I haven't used any of the 100 I have been given.
---
They weight less.
---
I do however THINK that they decompose faster.
---
can I 1 shot the 1 shotter?
---
Oh ok
---
What level and specs?
---
No kidding
---
I would be interested in that.  How much?   I’m XB also.  I’ll be in later.  GT/Krazylikeafox.   
---
I'm praying like hell Tuesdays update doesn't break more than it fixes.  I am looking forward to 800 stash capacity though...
---
I'm having trouble deciding what to keep what to get rid of. I had a whole set of legendary marine combat armour I gave up for other 3* items. It's like a battle of constant torment should I get rid of this or that? Do I really need 25 bulk glass???? I can always sell 15 bulk glass and 2 bulk concrete and I'll have just enough room
---
Yeah. I probably wondered where that extra empty fram came that I didn't need. 
---
Did he know da wae?
---
It’s max level and  2 shot explosive with 250 damage resistance I think
---
Pretty sure
---
Also, how many stars?
---
Surprised your fights lasted 30 seconds. Seems like it’s usually done in less than 10. 
---
I don't "assume" anything, search "error" here in Reddit and you'll see a lot have been banned so how is that assuming anything?   
---
Keep in mind this post is for information and trying to help people. Bethesda CS isn't the greatest if you didn't know...
---
If you are sell I would offer like 1k
---
Right?!  I sang fuck fuck fuck it along with it every time because it's way funnier especially when she does the shrill one
---
You aren’t alone. Lots of this being reported since Friday. 
---
I kind of suspect the duplicate ones are meant to be there. For example, say in the early days of your game you maxed out pharma farmer. Later on down the line you probably wont need it maxed. One rank would suffice. Since you csnt downgrade a maxed perk, you've got that duplicate card, so you just use that and put the spare 2 points onto something else.
---
Just my thoughts on the matter.
---
Right haha they really are usually pretty short unless theres a bunch of hopping and running lol
---
Ok nice probably don’t want to scrap my inky paramedic uniform. You think we can buy one at WhiteSpring ?
---
Hit up the Wendigo cave!  It's everywhere in there.
---
That's a fair comment. Sadly new content is the only way I'll come back. Put in 400+ hours. Had fun for most of it. But I'm bored. 
---
4 PA spawns in Watoga. On the roofs of the High School, EMS and the vertibird north of EMS and one on the ground by a vertibird in the city center. 
---
I'd probably wait till they fix the durability issues, then you could probably get more for it.
---
Just curious, since this just happened to my buddy as well, do you ever blow up other people’s camps or engage in a lot of PvP? Idgaf if you do or not, it’s a PvP game at times and that’s part of it. I just fear that the cry babies have went for the jugular and reported people who grief them for duping instead of griefing. If they provide a convincing case then maybe Bethesda is not carefully considering things and just placing bans. 
---
Bulk glass is garbage
---
I think at least 5-6k, it's a no-more-existent weapon
---
I thought you meant directly into the building like the Fallout 4 mats
---
I think you can \[buff\[ it up at a tinkers WB to increase it\_
---
For farming cores I got to watoga three power armor spawns and a fusion gen in the same room as one of them, though it's behind a lvl 3 lock
---
Waitttt can somebody explain this a bit more?  I never realized this until now and have been using the Better Criticals and Four Leaf Clover perks. I use VATS a lot. What exactly isn’t work right as I probably have been oblivious to it.
---
It was the plans, but pre-patch
---
Fireproof level 3 reduces the damage from their sonic attacks.
---
Bulk all the things. Keep 5 bulk of each thing. If you can't bulk it and you can sell it, don't keep more than 100 and sell the excess. Limit your ammo too. Always carry all the ammo you have for the weapons you're carrying and limit the excess for ammo you don't use to say 500. Check you mods tab too. I find if I'm not relieving excess stash capacity by managing weapons, armor, chems, aid or ammo, It's probably mods I didn't know I had and can easily take up 10, 20 pounds or more in excess BS.
---
But the biggest advice I have is to not be sentimental and just Marie Kondo your stash with extreme prejudice on a regular basis. That level 45 plasma rifle you found in a suitcase is not worth the 20 pounds it takes up. Neither is all your old armor. Unless it's legendary and currently fits your playstyle, ditch it. Basically unless you're currently using it or it's something you WILL use, if only occassionally: Sell it, scrap it, stick it in a suitcase or drop it in a doggie bag in the forest. It doesn't matter that it might be cool someday or that it's got value or whatever -- it needs to go. The only armor I have is what I'm wearing and with the exception of a 2* Gatling gun I use for SBQ fights and a Gauss rifle I'm converting to prime when I get another violet flux, I don't have any (or many) excess weapons. 
---
Just got online on Xbox one and got this same notice when logging in. Want my money back. This is the last time I’m playing this game. Thanks Bethesda for wasting my time.
---
Crap. Ok thanks.
---
Would personally enjoy a radio station that played nothing but old time Appalachian music. Imagine hearing Gid Tanner furiously playing the fiddle when you're running from a scorchbeast. Or Jean Ritchie ballads when in the Ash Heap.  
---
Or I guess early bluegrass would fit the bill for the mid-20th Century cultural vibe even better.
---
I just picked up a prime gatling plasma for 1250. I think 5 to 6 is way off the mark in this market,  but that is just me.
---
It’s only 1 Star and I really could take whatever offers you think it’s worth
---
So no, you can't then. Thought so.
---
I'm kinda pissed at them for making Wheeling a lumber mill and nothing else. Lots of opportunities here. Former capital of Virginia. Lots of history. But noooooo :P
---
I am :)
---
A tragic comedy of errors:
---
1. Stash full
---
2. 2 hours gathering junk without freeing up stash space
---
3. Defending someone else's camp
---
4. Trigger happy
---
5. Pacifist mode.
---
6. Looking at your menu.
---
Seriously?
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha with the current track record expect some bugs to be fixed and 20 more emerge per bug.
---
Yeah I live in Fairmont and there is absolutely nothing here
---
I’m almost positive I read somewhere that a special event will trigger on the actual holiday with other masks released.
---
Depends on how long you want to wait with it. There has been talk about heavy weapons, but I have not seen anything definitive on what or when they are going to do anything. 
---
It was a joke
---
Bruh, I've been farming events for this since launch. Not one drop. LOL
---
If you have four leaf clover, any shot has a chance to refill the crit meter, but as of now, not when that shot is a crit itself. Used to be you could chain some together with the right builds.
---
They ever fix the ultricite fusion cores
---
Yeah I'm bracing for the inevitable
---
I usually only get this error when trying to join a group through party on PS4. If I click OK and attempt to join normally I get in just fine, but sometimes I do have to close the app because it will take an indefinite time to find a world. 
---
Yup I'm excited to read all the new reddit posts!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
What platform are you on I might be interested in buying it off you. If your on pc. for a more than generous price later tonight around 9pm est
---
Farm Whitespring and West Tek, loot everything, bulk what I can and make the vendor loop. That's about it. Level 105.
---
What value does the game assign it?
---
I DIDNT KNOW THE GUN WAS LOADED. I'm tired of hearing that gets on my nerves.
---
Go back to start, create new character. No quests until you reach level 50.
---
&gt; Instead of Negativing me...... PROVIDE YOUR OWN ANSWERS PEOPLE. (When I am wrong.)
---
OK. I'll provide you an answer. You can NOT use a plasma core in power armor. 
---
Could be its bethesda so....
---
I’d be interested on Xbox. 
---
Great find!  Thank you for sharing! :)
---
Another great tip!  Thank you for sharing! :)
---
Console or PC?
---
In fallout 4 junkies added about 10% damage for each addiction you were withdrawing from. So if you had a bunch it could get very powerful. 
---
I haven’t played tried it in 76 but it may work the same way. It’s still a risky playstyle given the side effects but if the damage boost is the same, it could be significant enough to be useful. If that’s your style 
---
Dont buy it
---
So much rage!

Found that list of Clan Discords for you, also try r/fo76filthycasuals They’re an active group and have player created events as well
---
A fuckton of bugs.
---
2. You start with 500 in Xbox And can earn 40-70 atoms daily. There are daily, week And montly chalenges. ALL give atoms. A cool bed is about 700 atoms. A Paint for PA is 1500~ And a outfit it's 1000~ (a cool one)
---
3. Almost no P.vP. exept for grifers And almost broken out game market after those duplicaters
---
Still buggy wouldn't say anything game breaking is going on atm and yes you can earn atoms I've sat pretty at 4k for a majority of the gane never purchased any and bought a decent amount of stuff.
---
You should take opinions from multiple people but I’ll share. 
---
1. No you should be good
---
2. Yes! There are plenty ways to earn atoms. I’ve never had to buy any with real money.
---
3. It all varies by person. I can look back and say I’ve had some great experiences and some not so good. I’m friendly so the majority of my encounters are either average or good.
---
Wow, thanks alot man! As a side note, does anyone know any solid farming locations for Ballastic Fiber? 
---
It’s a shame really, I wish we had the second part of the song in the game.
---
Are they really worth that much?
---
I dont touch pvp at all if i can help it.
---
Ahhh ok I gotcha. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I don't usually experience game breaking bugs. the community is fine some people are toxic and they have voice chat in game. I get about 50 atoms a day from just playing the game. If you have friends it's recommended to get the game. Without friends, it's fine if you like grinding and exploring the lore about the game.
---
I am with you one hundred percent! I played a little at launch and put it down because i have faith Beth will fix enough for me to come back in a few updates (hopefully) and enjoy it fully
---
There’s an update on Tuesday?
---
Hi. Sorry about the ban. So what does the log in screen say when you are banned?  Same thing as this op screenshot? Or is it more like  “ you are banned “ 
---
Sounds like a fun idea! Settlement/Camp building is easily my favourite activity in fallout4/76. Will add ya next time I’m on (my ign is ariyx)! I just finished a new camp with my third character, feel free to come visit too =)
---
ive seen multiple mothmen at my camp and have only seen one flatwoods monster, i think the camp location has to be in the forest for it to really spawn
---
very detailed. Thanks for the insight.
---
Normal police uniform works as well
---
I’m level 45 and have encountered Mothman on 4 separate occasions now. My spouse has a level 55 and a level 15 character and hasn’t encountered MM on either of them.
---
Neither of us has encountered FM
---
RNG is RNG I guess.
---
Lvl 58. Never even seen the Mothman. Killed a flat woods monster yesterday. Saw the flat woods once when I was like lvl 5 or so. 
---
Yeah buddy.  They are increasing the C.A.M.P. stash limit to 800 plus a few other things I don't care about because I stopped reading after 800lb stash as I have a hoarding problem...
---
This is so true
---
Me too. Last I heard it was “after this month” glad to have a date on it
---
Jump servers if you do t like it, its what i get told when i complain about "raiders" deatroying my camp or following me around shooting at me, dont like it find a server where there is not a camp there

---
this is probably the most important perks for sniping. Stealth is currently not working properly so I'm not sure how it plays right now. Id use this as a base.
---
It's still bugged. I checked SD 04, no dice. 
---
Then dont cry about it and go find some pvp, if you were looking for pvp and did it to get wanted fine but crying about it on reddit just makes you look like a whiny bitch
---
I found a police uniform in one of the tents at Morgantown Airport and it worked
---
It might be lagg you know. On his screen he is running up to you and hitting you but on your screen he is still standing still.
---
Had this happen alot of times aswell.
---
I’ll shoot u a friend request and we’ll talk over party chat
---
I use the responder corpse to the right of Vault 76 as you leave.    Usually its a collection of ammo I don't use, purified water, chems, plans, and recipes.   I toss in the odd legendary as well provided its low enough level to be used.
---
How do you power a wall?
---
Oh I know, I have to say it out loud to convince myself.
---
I like the idea of dropping whimsical noob gifts as the first Overseers Stash. I'm already thinking of totally upgrading a 10mm pistol &amp; leaving it there with 1,000 rounds.
---
I have my base set up open. I dont mind if people take the crops or purified water. I did come back to my base covered in pip boy decorations tho
---
1. All the fires have been put out, most bugs at this point are just annoying. The launch was rough but with the current patch it's about on the level of the typical Bethesda experience.
---
2. Cash shop is 100% cosmetic items. You *can* get Atoms in-game by completing different challenges, they aren't hard to earn but the amount of Atoms you collect slows down as you wrap up more and more challenges. Everything is a little overpriced, but 90% of it is crap so unless you want lots of things you should be fine. 
---
3. 99% of the players I've met are pretty chill. You'll hear horror stories of griefers from this sub, but in my 100+ hours of playing I've not met a one and they're pretty limited in how they can screw you anyway. But PvP's kind of a waste of time in my experience playing semi-casually. 
---
I got the suppressor for 9mm before getting all the receivers iirc. For hunting rifle it was near the end, if not the last one I don't remember. 
---
Thats the thing, he was moving from side to side like he was trying to dodge my hits, not holding still, plus i got earraped by the powerfist noises and it destroyed my health in 2 seconds.
---
Same for radio tower buildings.
---
False 
---
I had the same thing happen to me yesterday.    Was rather surprised when it happened.   I do not have video or pics.    I cannot remember which piece it was that I broke down but it was definitely not a combat armor helmet, I haven't looted one of those in a few weeks so I have none to break down.
---
I never had to click on the railing itself, just go into the corners of the walkway at the top and the prompt to "survey area" should pop up.
---
200+ hours - I have encountered flatwoods monster once and the mothman dozens of times. I have determined mothman takes dislike to some players (i.e. me) &amp; harrases them constantly.
---
Have blurry photos to prove cryptid mothman existence

I cannot stress enough how well this man’s music would fit with [walking the roads of Appalachia](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YcqauC49Xmc) 
---
I'm level 77 and seen Mothman once. Seen Flatwood monster at least 3 times. 
---
Just luck of the draw.
---
Gay 
---
He had a two shot explosive powerfist obviously /s
---
I'm not sure because I've never used them, but I do know they're ammo for the Gatling laser once it has the prime receiver, but I don't think they can be used for power armor since they're meant for the gun.
---
Just put a power connector on the wall and wire it
---
commenting for later
---
You can also see locations nearby on your compass, the ones you haven’t been to before are much dimmer than ones you have been to.  This has been there since FO3, but still useful.
---
I agree, but it really depends how often they drop new items. For example if there is 1000 atoms worth of new items in the shop every week, but I can only get 800 for challenges, I am more likely to want to get everything and buy atoms to get them. Right now, I think the prices are too high for me to be tempted to get anything in particular. 
---
Nice,  good with salt will be on my list to  level up now
---
Neither have I but the issue really isn't the content's quality (or lack of) for the price. The issue is that the atom shop has more updates than the game has bug fixes or actual content updates for game play. That and the refund policy, security breach, etc. The atom shop could have bad or incredibly good stuff it doesn't matter. But it shouldn't be a bigger priority for Bethesda than fixing bugs/exploits. Which at the rate it's getting updates certainly feels like it is. Some of the stuff in the atom shop is cool and I wouldn't mind buying the stuff with money if the state of the game was better. But it's not, so I'd rather they focus on the game rather than the atomic shop.
---
I'm having this problem digital copy I hope I'm not banned I have 1100+ hours in the game
---
Please as a random player give me a reason to come back to fallout 76.
---
Shitty duper.
---
\[PS4\]
---
I've seen the Mothman three times in the exact same spot in The Mire, on the road just to the east of Big B's Rest stop. Flatwoods monster I've seen once outside Whitesprings and twice on random clifftops while wandering around the border of Savage Divide and Cranberry Bog.
---
So, "Chomp'n on his cell mate."...suddenly gay.
---
For t-51?  I find the spawns are suit-constant everywhere else.
---
Ah ok, if you were on Xbox I could give you a helmet.  
---
Lucky... I'm still waiting for a Anti-Armor or explosve .50 Cal to drop. :(
---
4 chances for that suit and a sub chance for the helmet. But you can just server hop and try again. 
---
I've been there a hundred times and have never seen a deathclaw anywhere in or near Whitesprings, dead or alive. Must be unlucky. Or lucky?
---
Well, “go figure it out for yourself” as a reply to a question posted in a subreddit **dedicated to the game** also seems to undermine the whole reason for having a community for it in the first place. Also, I love how sensitive people get over a silly downvote.
---
You are indeed assuming. Just because bans have happened doesn't mean they're the reason for the error you linked. It's really clear in your original post that you don't actually know if it was a ban issue. 
---
What you last wrote is like saying "I don't know if I was mugged, but muggings happen, so I was mugged". 
---
Your intention might be to help people, but it's not helpful to spread assumptions when you have literally no evidence other than more assumptions from other people.
---
We’re lucky they didn’t do that and then make the Flaming mod part of the skin, charging us for something we already have. Cough PA lamps cough.
---
As a electrical engineer this is hilarious, also your "configurations" is software also and not hardware.
---
Good doin business with ya!  Sweet base btw. 
---
sounds like the kind of lag you get in most online games. rubberbanding issues and such. 
---
I dont melee all that often so I dont know the distance of the VATS teleport.
---
sounds like a fire damage mod.
---
and a legendary that gives you more damage the less dr you have (hence the hazmat suit)
---
No problems, and dont buy it.
---
Most likely a lot of lag and a bloodied bat. 
---
That's the opposite of skepticism; that's conspiracy theory at its finest.
---
Do Bethesda like money? Sure. Do they want you to spend money in the Atom Shop? Indubitably. Are they playing some sort of long con years in advance, hooking you in with free atoms until you cannot resist the urge to buy cosmetics with real money? LOL. 
---
I PvP to find the pack-rat players. Atom bless 'em.
---
passive weight perks
---
you make your build and if you have 5 int your passives (whether it be crafting or weight reduction) are still limited to 5
---
easy mode
---
base your damage around it get free passive as a bonus
---
Sounds about right. 
---
Go there now..and keep server-hopping ..I promise..it will show up eventually 😀
---
not deathclaws, but if you fast travel to Whitesprings, go inside to the lobby/shops, run past the shops and out the door at the back, you can find a uncommon/high level creature. Usually you will have to go past the flower garden and spam VAT's to find the creature. Once you've got its attention, turn and run back to the main building and let the robot security distract it as you pump bullets into it so you get XP and loot.
---
From there, jump onto the park car, then the wall and work your way onto the roof of the maintenance building. You can pick of some level 42 and 62 ghouls and they can't get near you. 
---
a good idea for those doubles of cards we all have
---
As smartassed as that is. It is an actual response.
---
Now would you do the OP a favor and tell him where he can use them?
---
Or you just wish to be a dick to everyone?
---
Cheapest Route is Harper's Ferry, Phoenix in Watoga, Watoga Station, RNG Station, Lewisburg Station, Enclave Bunker, Whitespring shops. 
---
The first time I encountered a tick I screamed out holy crap what is killing me!! I look all around and see nothing so I look at the ground and see this giant tick turning red from my character my response was holy $#!+ get away from me. Fast forward to my encounter to the Hermit Crap I screamed out loud omg omg what is that get away from me.
---
I hope I unlock it soon lol
---
He said he's got a scapular injury. That's your shoulder blade. Sitting and playing a comp or console isn't really going to aggravate that. As long as he's not doing any heavy lifting or big arm movements, i think he's fine.
---
He's probably single/no kids and just likes playing video games. I don't think there is any harm in doing the thing you enjoy just because it doesn't align with what *you* would choose to do. If I was in his position, you better believe I would be in my underwear with a pile of empty soda cans and Hot Pocket wrappers on the floor next to me just enjoying my time off!
---
That answer has already been given elsewhere in the thread. But they are used for Gatling Plasma. 
---
Constantly. Ammo, junk, gear, you name it. Only time I don't is when my friend list won't sync.
---
1. Are there still game breaking bugs: Yes, check the known bug list you'll see for yourself there are lots of bugs Bethesda admits to knowing and plans on fixing later but is currently unable to such as "items disappearing from inventories" as well as plenty more bugs in the community made bug list.
---
2. The atom shop is entirely optional and currently is cosmetic only but there is one case where they gave stat bonuses for costumes purchased and worn from the atom shop (but some costumes in game also gave a bonus) gaining atoms is also fairly easy.
---
3. The in-game economy is almost non-existent since dupers plagued the market for a large amount of time. As well as people trading irl money for items. Recently (and we are talk very recently) Bethesda has made some efforts to stop dupers but it really wasn't enough imo. We might see more item trading in the future in which case go to marketplace76 sub Reddit. But we have no idea if another duping method will be found in the future. As well as there really is no in-game option to sell your wares without going through forums like the marketplace76. 
---
Should you buy the game? Not till the new content update comes out. Then maybe depending on its quality.  The game is still not complete in it's current state and I wouldn't recommend people buy it till there is more stuff to do and less bugs in the game.
---
1. There are a lot of bugs, but they range from frustrating to amusing.  (Examples include challenges that will not progress, bodies you cannot loot, and the infamous stretchy-necked dead.)  But no real game-breaking bugs.  Your most common game-breaking issue will be server disconnects, which will probably be more frequent than pretty much any other online game you've played, but not so much so that the game is unplayable.   And the servers have been growing more stable for most people thanks to a combination of Bethesda fixes and dwindling player count.
---
2. The cash shop has no items that offer mechanical benefits.  The items are cosmetic, ranging from outfits to emotes to new furniture for your base.  Everything in the shop is grotesquely overpriced if you pay real money, but you can earn Atoms in-game fairly easily.  You gain Atoms by completing challenges.  There are a large number of preset challenges, most of which work and many of which you will complete just through normal play.  In addition, there are daily and weekly challenges that, if pursued, will net you enough that you can easily save up for anything in the store that interests you.  Most things in the store will not interest you.
---
3. While there are occasional griefers, these are rare.  You are far more likely to run into a kind, helpful individual.  But mostly, the community is apathetic.  The experience generally reads as people are playing their solo or private-group games and just happen to be visible to other people doing the same.  Most days, the presence of other players is mildly distracting and briefly immersion-disrupting, nothing more.  If they are noticed at all.
---
Not certain. I saw a fireman's hat there once. 
---
Probably. 
---
Just help him, he'll solo them all but with a little help it's much faster.
---
Look at that we having actual discussion and not dicking around.
---
Lol... I bet that you know a LOT about computers
---
Very True!
---
&gt;9mm
---
I feel like this is the obvious reason why it wasn't applied to the stash, but I reckon the best solution would be to hard punish that behavior.
---
For example, if your stash becomes "Over-encumbered" due to trait changing, you have 300 seconds to return and fix this or excess items are automatically destroyed.
---
Otherwise I feel people would stack every single reduce weight perk, especially for weapons, throw it all in the stash, then change out, making their stash weigh something like 2000+.

Alternatively, there should be a split between combat and utility perks. Combat perks (like extra damage etc) can be swapped around as it currently does, while utility has to be changed at your C.A.M.P, effects both you and your camp, and applies to things like carry weight, crafting perks, lockpicking and so on.
---
I see no reason why we should have to carefully balance utility &amp; combat. We should be able to change combat on the go, while having to plan ahead for what utility would suit us best.
---
This game STILL Sucks!
---
I'll give you 2k for the laser on PS4
---
:-D...At least I got a laugh out this..because the OP is right.
---
Of course xgay1 will freeze 
---
Phoenix is a bloody troublemaker, an eyebot just floating past is enough to get laser lights flowing. I have run into quite a few situations where I have to knock a few robots down to get some trading done. 
---
Why is there not one video on this log in failed message on you tube?
---
That's 9.47 hours played each and every single day on average.
---
What the actual fuck. This can't be healthy.
---
I never keep gunsmith equipped. I only use it for crafting. Weaponsmith gets me enough time in between repairs and I don't have to keep it equipped either. I use nerd rage and power user regularly.
---
Every few days I have to craft soup..I usually make maybe 75 at a time which lasts a few days..at the same time I craft healing salves I don't every really use stims..for fighting it's usually whitesprings and harpers ferry..I also like nuke zones
---
Thanks! Hope the armor treats u well!
---
The utility/combat perk card dichotomy needs to be addressed somehow. Maybe having like a robot/mutant/animal? follower with their own modifiable carrywright could be a solution? 
---
IT Just Works ™️ Bethesda 
---
Probably lag or server desync.
---
That won't work.  There are about half a dozen vendor "factions" and each faction (not each individual vendor) has 200 caps.  Thus, if you sell to the Responder vendor in Flatwoods until it is out of caps, then go to the Responder vendor at the Morgantown Airport, that vendor will also be out of caps.  But the Raider vendor in Sutton won't be.  
---
These cap pools reset every day.  If you know where at least one vendor of each faction is located, you can dump 1200 caps worth of crap daily at the cost of fast travel.
---
U have patience..black powder rifles take too long to reload for me..I've got the TS dragon 
---
The vendors are the robots at the train stations. My camp is just outside of Morgantown, I'll run over and sell my chems right away and whatever junk I'm able to. Whatever I can't sell I leave in one of the suitcases. 
---
Weird it's not appearing for me. Do you happen to have it owned?
---
/agree
---
Take away 1 turret and 3 purifiers
---
Most vendors are at the train stations. I only use them when I walk up with a large supply of crap. Just to turn all the hunting rifles into caps, so I can buy various supplies that are sometimes hard to come buy.  I really hate that they dont buy ammo.  I only use two or three weapons and the only ammo I use is .45, .308, and 10mm.  I have so much .38 as well as some other, I just end up leaving it near the vendor somewhere.  Super annoying. 
---
Could do, but that would push the game further into a single player direction imo. I just hate that feeling you get when you apply something like thru-hiker, knowing you COULD be doing more damage if you only were more self-controlling with what you picked up lol
---
Yeah 
---
also depends where your camp is
---
Personally I always just do the Powering Up quest, it’s decent XP and rewards (like plans for generators), and it’s reasonably fun for me at least.
---
I got similar error.
---
Fortunately,  before I lost my shit, I discovered my router had lost it's. 
---
Game on!
---
I feel the same way lol. And to be fair, I feel like I gotta keep picking stuff up constantly since there is no set hub for trading. If there was, I would not feel the need to always stock up on certain junk since I know I could trade for what I need and I could play the way I enjoy most. 
---
I actually don’t think it’s up to Bethesda.  I think it’s more up to Sony and Microsoft.  I heard MS was on-board but Sony didn’t want it. 
---
Guess I'll start wandering those clifftops.
---
My wife and I had this happen last night and it's the best Fallout 76 experience we've had since we began playing a week after release. For the very first time, it felt like Fallout 4 coop, which all my wife and I ever want from a multiplayer Fallout.  
---
I understand there's an element of spontaneity that exists in a server with other people, but in our experience these good moments are dwarfed by:  
---
* Hit mechanics requiring everyone to sit around with their thumb up their ass getting beat by mobs until we're sure everyone who wants to has gotten a hit. This coordination is difficult with random players who either don't care or don't know.  
---
* Open mic dogs barking, spousal arguments, burping, etc.  
---
* The suspension-of-disbelief breaking of having random people do random things when we're trying to go down a quest line.  
---
* Server lag caused by multiple players in an area.  
---
* About an equivalent number of griefing moments.
---
Bethesda, please give us private servers or the option to host our own.
---
Second floor of watoga high in a chemistry class room. 
---
Yes! I hope this is in the works. My nephew plays but he’s on Xbox so we haven’t gotten to adventure together. He recently told me he’s already prepared a room for me at his camp for when we finally get cross platform :)
---
I heard its going to F2P too with Physical Copies being pulled from stores and all..
---
Sony's and Microsoft should just allow it it will bring communitys closer.
---
Been server hopping at the watoga train station for a few days. Found BOS underarmor (knight and officer) on the same run but haven't seen combat. Would love to know if there's a smarter way.
---
I had a glowing mothman chase me down in watoga, seen more mothman encounters then the later ( only seen the Flatwoods monster once 
---
Maybe with only people who have done the missions can tag her.
---
My route is:
---
* whitespring 
---
* pleasant valley station
---
* harpers ferry
---
* watoga shopping
---
* watoga station
---
* flatwoods (after going to vault 76 for free fast travel)
---
I do not have access to the enclave bunker yet so I can only go to 6 of the 7 factions..total travel costs is 49 caps to sell for 1200..so I net 1151 a day
---
Same...I also hit the flooded train yards 2-3tier locked safes...no dice
---
It's the worst I usually leave lol
---
Yes! Needs to be some version of in-game auctions... probs at the train stations. I wouldn't carry around so much dumb crap that "I might need for repairing some of my less frequently used gear" if I could just buy it. Also gives SOMETHING to do (make money), because the game is a bit dull without a real endgame lol
---
As an electrical engineer, I use a computer at work... It has excel... Derpdederp... -dilbert
---
I mean, if it's shocks or jetpack it's in the right ball park. Maybe a couple hundred caps too high if it was shocks but 1800 is right around where it should be for some stuff.
---
Honestly as long as Bethesda does ANYTHING it would be great. I want to work out the kinks and try to figure out what is the most fun and balanced possibility.
---
I and very optimistic about the potential levels of fun this perk system provides :)
---
Do tell...where m8?
---
Yeah.. the longer they go, the worse off things are likely to end.  :(
---
they should have a cap on it, and only allow players that has done the enclave or BoS event be able to join it...
---
There are 7 sets of vendors.   Each set shares a common cap pool, so once they reach 0 caps then all vendors of that faction are at 0.   You can acquire a total of 1400 caps from them.    Here are the sets.
---
1) Responder - Flat Woods, Morgantown Station, Morgantown Airport, Grafton Station, Grafton, Charleston Station Charleston Fire Department, Camden Park, Welch Station and Lewisburg Station
---
2) Raider - Sutton Station, Sunnytop Station, Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, Pleasant Valley Station, and R&amp;G Station
---
3) Whitespring - Whitespring Resort, and Whitespring Station
---
4) Enclave - Whitespring Bunker
---
5) Free States - Harpers  Ferry
---
6) BoS - Watoga Shopping Center
---
7) Special - Watoga Station and Grahm (Wandering Supermutant)
---
My camp isn't to far from Pleasant Valley so I do a circuit from Pleasant Valley to the Whitespring.    I then head back to my camp and hit Harpers Ferry and then the two Watoga vendors.    That leaves just the Responder faction and I usually go to Vault 76 and hit the Responders at Flat Woods and gather meat from the Brahmins while there.
---
I’m a level 130 and I see them all the time there , but I’m seriously melee overpowered!  I kill those things like nothing I’m bummed . I’ll sometimes get a standard weapon or combat knife and go at it for sport just to make it exciting again!!!i think the best time I’ve had is gaming with my adult kids we started new characters and went in to the mire at level 9 with fire axes and power frames for armor . The first encounter after Freddie’s fright store involved two death claws and a pack of 3 YAU GUI ( I think it was a triggered event we stumbled on!!)talk about fun !! We had a blast yelling screaming ;my adult daughter was screaming for her life calling  her dad to save her as the crowned albino death claw ran towards her and we where pinned by the other death claw and yau guai  !!!  My son  was screaming and laughing hysterically like a weirdo slamming med-x and psycho and I was running like my ass was in fire depleting all my stims !! Good times !!! 
---
There are 7 vendor factions. Each faction will have 200 caps to buy your stuff. The caps available resets every 20 hours. So if you visit all factions you can sell up to 1400 a day. 
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
Note, the plans are no longer randomized at vendors the way they use to be but now are more expensive.
---
Yeah. Trading on some sub reddits has made this game a lot more fun since reaching level 80+  lol. 
---
I'm in the mountains in front of a stream and river 
---
Bethesda, trouble tkt opened with them
---
I do a normal melee build, I only use power armor in blast zones or higher rad areas where rad x don’t work.  You don’t need power armor in this game except perhaps blast zones.
---
Do you buy and sell alot of high end items?  Your 100k limit may be Caps! When you can sell guns in the 15-20 k range it does not take long to get 100k plus. Technically, caps were probly meant to be a rare item.... Do you have multiple characters to store caps? 
---
Thx that place is tough too lol
---
Top floor shower/locker room has one spawn for it
---
All is fair in war, and a rifle will most likely one shot you in real life, so why not here?
---
The corpse outside vault 76
---
I would recommend asking again a week after patch 6 comes out.  We sometimes get additional issues after patch day.
---
They’re not, just a relatively rare occurrence. 
---
Exactly, power armor = noob armor. Get a set of assassin sentinel, or cavalier, and watch and laugh as any noob using scrub armor melts before your greatness!
---
I did just get a marine wetsuit so at least there are new items, but I only see a plan about once every half dozen hops and I hate server hopping.
---
I've seen them. If I'd known then how worthless Explosive Vent was, I would have bought the shocks instead. I was hoping for some jetpack/EV fun. 
---
Listen it’s comfortable in here
---
Don’t forget the transit hub inside the locked door behind the front desk.
---
holy fuck i don't even have that many hours in Skyrim and Fallout 4 combined.
---
What does instigating do?
---
Up to sony not being a dick
---
Run liscensed plumber for you pipe bolt action. It costs 2 less perk points and is 10% stronger than gunsmith.
---
A small amount grows at the bins behind the Whitespring 
---
Nice. Going to do that. 
---
Fort Defiance usually has a bunch in the brotherhood area. 3rd and 4th floor near the beds usually. Its not hard to find, but its quantities are tiny. I sometimes buy a bulk ballistic fiber from a vendor if im really running out. Its probably the one bit of scrap i will never not pick up.
---
Welcome to the eccentric madhouse that is the Fallout reddit(s)! Hope you enjoy the mixed content as much as you enjoyed meeting the FO76 players :D
---
Sounds like you got a corrupted file. Uninstall, delete game data, power cycle, rebuild database, turn off and reinstallation should fix it.
---
That sounds cool. Over by the behemoth?
---
White Spring Sentry robots. That's like 4-6 cores per server hop and takes a few minutes each.
---
You have to have 8 from the same silo. The nuke codes for the week are also available online (not sure if posting the link is kosher here). 
---
I find this very offensive.
---
Good to know. Will not do this event then... condolence to you my brotha. I have a lvl 35 double barrel explosive, would give it to you for free if you like. 
---
There's hundreds in those fields where the pink trees are in cranberry bog..but once I hear a scorchbeast I leave the server
---
Just made the switch. Picked up a bloodied lever. Doing a lot of damage. Enjoying not blowing myself up in close quarters 
---
What does Assassin sentinel or cavalier armor do ? 
---
Just telling the truth 
---
Having trouble finding another costume found a cop cap ( extra ) and scrap and did not work 
---
Alpha codes only work at site alpha, same with beta and charlie, but its really all for naught if you dont already also have a launch keycard and have decrypted the correct solution from the 18 possible
---
Legendary gear isn't good because of level. There are many cases where a level 5 weapon with three stars can out damage a level 50 weapon with three stars. Increasing your chances of getting a 3 star of any level is worth the time and effort. It's one of the reasons farming horde events is worth it. Because you want to increase your chances of getting loot with really good effects. Sadly though this process is entirely RNG which sucks because of the low amount of legendaries that spawn to begin with. If Bethesda added more horde events or possibly events players can start with a 0 timer on it that spawn in legendaries regardless of how difficult it was players would do it. 
---
TL DR: Uranium Fever is still worth it.
---
r/beetlejuicing 
---
That’s not what they care about though. Microsoft was the culprit last gen. Whichever console is performing better in sales is reluctant to open up cross platform play. All they want to do is encourage more people to buy their system and play on their system. 
---
Not too far from whitespring ..pretty close to black water mine..I've tried a few locations around the map and this is my favorite..helps cut down fast travel costs as well
---
How long did it take to hear back from them and did it happen today or was it the day of the update? I sent a ticket and went on an epic rambling rant about everything. I’ll probably get banned for it. But did they say specificity what you got banned for doing?  On the patch notes it said they would remove people that had too much of specific items in inventory and it would be done during the patch update or within a few few hours after it was finished. 
---
Find Power Armor, or go to a Power Plant. I prefer Poseidon, as I can also get concrete.
---
I can never reach the ones under the bed. How do you get them? I don't wanna waste a frag.
---
I sadly have a non-legendary. But still, insane weapon.
---
And it saves you supplies building the fusion generator.  The work area usually doesn't have enough resources to make it
---
What is the phantom pet weight problem?
---
Welcome...Fallout 76 is like life, chaotic and exciting and you never know what’s next. Great game...have a blast!
---
&gt;I do a normal melee build, I only use power armor in blast zones or higher rad areas where rad x don’t work.  You don’t need power armor in this game except perhaps blast zones.
---
What armor do you typically use? There are so many types I'm confused by them. i.e.: metal, heavy metal, marine, heavy leather, raider... gd lol 
---
I think *any* map with thumbtacks, lights, or markers on them will give you locations. That was a thing back in Skyrim and I think F4 too
---
By the time you found one, you'll have all the mods for it from scrapping them.
---
That snapshout outside of Vault 76 had my consumption-in-progress beverage exiting the premises via my nostrils from my laughing :)
---
Thank you for your very valuable input here... and the laugh... and the clean-up ;)
---
There had to be a downside for buying the game for 10 bucks.
---
Bloodied is strongest hands down. With the right build the dmg on a bloodied weapon will increase 99%. Meaning a bloodied one star is literally better than any 3* combination that doesn't include bloody. 
---
Two-shot, anti armor, and furious all preform roughly the same but you still probably want to avoid two shot on a vats build. On a high Life vats build either furious or anti armor are fine. You won't notice much difference between them.
---
Do yourself a favor and just find one on the marketplace and trade caps. Save you a headache.  Was looking for the target hud since day one and ended up buying the mod from someone else
---
Only have the Pump shotgun prime receiver, and I got it from the SBQ. In my experience that's the only place you can get them.
---
I make it a point to try and leave useful items in any overseer stashes I come across. I also try and put things in any container I can find outside 76 to help out the new arrivals.
---
1400 isn't that good tbh. I have an AA DCG with 40% swing speed and 90% reduced weight that does 1200. Unarmed only has one perk that increases damage (Iron Fist). It's not even Bloodied. It shoots up to 1500 if rad worms is active, and up to 2k dmg if rad worms AND Strange In Numbers is active. If I had Bloodied, I would probably be doing 3k+ with both active and maybe 1700-2000 with neither. 
---
If you’ve completed Mayor for a Day the robots will not attack you, even if you kill one of them.  ( legendaries sometimes fight back but not all the time) so you can help Phoenix out and get some delicious steel, lead and aluminum in the process 
---
And blackjack and hookers.
---
You know what? They can keep the greenhouses, planters, and jacuzzis!
---
The Gatling, by definition, is auto...
---
Yep, you're understanding it right. Sometimes vendors carry mods, but the best way to learn them is just to craft a bunch the cheapest piece of that armor, and the lowest possible level, and then scrap them. Perks like Armorer, Super Duper  and Scrapper work very well with this. You do need the base plans (marine limbs, marine chest) to do this. 
---
One thing I just caught; when upgrading, there are many upgrades, but Combat Armor cannot be modded to be heavy, sturdy, or light, it just comes as one of those tiers.
---
When you go to buy your armor, you can either go straight to looking for 3* pieces, which will save caps but may take longer, or look for 2* pieces and upgrade later, costing more in the long run.
---
Probably not much of a Fallout/Mom's House crossover, lol. But when I hit picture mode and saw the ceiling fan behind my the character, the words, Good Morning, Julia, popped into my head.
---
just let me grow some silt beans! I need to cook me up some more of that delicious Appalachili.
---
I was reported for taking someone's junk from the Overseer's Cache, that's about it.
---
That's how i left it set up,  idk maybe it is lit but i just can't tell
---
While I will grant that it should have better loot, failure should always be an option.  After all, it is the final boss.  Not everything should operate like clockwork.  Every now and then, you get dealt a bad hand and make the best of it.  Spontaneous complications are what make the game fun.
---
Can't delete camp built components such as floors and walls.
---
Workshop won't load properly.
---
This has been an issue for weeks for us. 
---
Level 222 and have only seen moth man twice. Both times he flew away.  Have seen/killed flatwoods moster several times.
---
Keep an eye out for ones that are already modded, I don’t know for sure but it *seems* like modded items are more likely to give plans than base unmodded ones
---
Yeah I can’t imagine the amount of meaningless complaints they must receive. 
---
Yeah Xbox Live handles certain online issues very weirdly... For example: In GTAV Online, if you go to network settings and test NAT while playing then it will somehow place you alone in a server and state that everyone else left the game.
---
Saw them every couple of days before the Vendor patch - since then, not a single Calibrated Shock for X-01. You can buy them on the trading subs, though.
---
Smart move
---
Someone else posted that a week ago, this guy is claiming to be the founder, I blame the parents. 
---
Making you wonder why the hell you’re over encumbered 
---
thanx bud
---
Check daily challenges, check weekly challenges.
---
Check ammo.
---
See where I am in regards to missions, plan challenges around missions plus my regular tour of top of the world, sunny top ski lanes, Harper's ferry and watoga.
---
Check for events I may be interested in.
---
Do above steps or get completely sidetracked just exploring an area.
---
Same here - on hiatus until some significant, compelling content drops. 
---
Yep I only half assed check for food and drinks when I’m there and I found like 30 dog food yesterday in a few hours 
---
PS4.  But more interested in having it myself for completionist sake.  
---
Are u Xbox? I can check for u
---
Good thing my camp is very close to the Morgantown high school
---
Nah it's just they realize the future
---
Stash is going to be upped to 800 this week.
---
No longer scrap mods when scrapping all
---
Rad worms are bugged right now and increase the positive and negative effects of your mutations. I think marsupial is the one that increases carry weight. So it's that getting pumped by worms. Increases food effects by 50% too.
---
Yeah, if I’m getting scrap or plants around there and I see a low level I’ll build them a fully modded low level gun and axe, and usually some protection modded under-armor 
---
yeah
---
So if I have the BOS legs but can’t use them, how do I know if I already have them?  Server hop till I find them again and look for known?  Do they show up in crafting menu or are they bugged from showing there? 
---
Thanks. 
---
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😋🤣
---
I wouldn't be mad if, rather than a hard level floor, you have to have made General in the Enclave to be counted toward the SBQ's hit point calculations or earn XP from her. That way, you're at least on the quest to launch a nuke yourself putting you in the same "class" progression-wise.
---
It's the same but this one is simplified, he build a gigantic cliffside castle. Totally changes the game.
---
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣
---
I don't consider myself a build expert at all, but I'm Lv. 113 and perfectly survivable without PA, outside of Nuke Events.
---
There are two schools of thought on this.  The current ~~fad~~ trend is a build where you try to counter intentionally low HP with Sentinel or Cavalier so you can reap the benefits of things like Bloodied and Unyielding.  The more typical school is using things like BoS Combat Armor with mods like Dense, and perks like Fireproof and Blocker, to keep your DR/ER high.  I'm in the latter camp.  I have Vanguard everything and use Vampire weapons to keep my HP topped off when possible.
---
tfw the Tattered Field Jacket is your life. And it has a 0.02% drop rate. And no one wants to sell it.
---
Get. A damn. Fusion core.
---
Where is a good place to farm firecap mushrooms?
---
L146, Mothman once, Flatwoods Monster once.
---
well, i think that list is way out dated.  tried like 4 of the discords, and all are invalid.  :-(
---
Well I learned mine through the plans I found at the grafton vendor so the show up along side Shadowed etc...sounds like if you learned them from scrapping it’s more of s problem 
---
I hear people speak of using alt builds for pack mules and things like that. How do you transfer materials between them? I play solo unless I need to help someone out so this info would benefit me greatly.
---
Inside the main building around the desks. Sometimes people beat you to it. If they haven't though they are on the floor, on the desks and there are quite a few. the other buildings might have 1 or 2, i usually don't bother looking though. the blue boxes on the desks and the floor that kinda look like milk crates usually have 3-4 in each. and then they are on the floor all around them. 
---
Also unarmed counts as melee. If a buff doesn't specify one handed or two handed but instead just says melee it will work for unarmed too.
---
Gotcha.  Thanks and good hunting. 
---
brilliant  write up and massive gain to the community.  ive wondered if "armor ap refresh" secondaries stack. i guess they do?
---
If you can't craft/mod something you should be able to (have materials, perk cards active, learned plans), the problem may be that your materials are split between you Inventory and your Stash. Put everything you need one place or the other and it should work.
---
This 
---
This. It's not valuable
---
I'd say it's about the same.  Both have places where they tend to spawn more often than not, and it's almost like they draw from the same pool (sometimes it's a Mothman, sometimes it's a Flatwoods Monster).
---
Oh to be able to grow cranberries and snap tail reeds at my base. Would make doing supply runs for cranberry relish so much easier.
---
Watoga, Belching Betty or whatever, and the Emmet Mountain site are where I found all of my T-51b stuff. 
---
Doesn't that require a major overhaul of the game?
---
I think they asked Todd Howard or someone else and they said no, and that they had no plans to do it in the future.
---
Not a developer so I would have no idea, but I imagine it would be a major undertaking.
---
If they were to do it, they would have done it from the beginning.
---
It’s shows items you own in the store even if the time for them is passed. My store shows Blackbird paint and the golden revolver skin, even though those are no longer available for purchase.
---
Remember though, that vendor doesn’t seem to sell them anymore so the only way I know for sure is for you to by the plans from another player and try to learn them, or at least see if they say “known”
---
You want to stick to heavy combat armor or marine armor (available at higher levels &gt;30).  The as you get legendaries upgrade the armor.  Sentinel armor protects while standing still.  Cavalier armor protects while sprinting.  Unyielding is also good as it increases all stats except endurance at lower health.
---
Farming Watoga for legendaries, lead, and steel. I start by spawning outside Watoga station, check mods, armor, and weapons at vendor to see if I need anything. 
---
I check Watoga high school, the alley near BOS vendor, check AMS, Watoga hospital for meds, bobble heads, legendaries, and magazines. Afterwards I cross to the civic center, grab the 2 fusion cores that sometimes spawn inside and kill the legendary. 
---
Last place I go is relatively unknown and is a great spot to get weapon plans and mods, go to the ranger station north of Watoga, after arriving you head south and look for a blue tarp, under the tarp are 2 random spawned creatures. Next to a skeleton is usually a plan or a mod, this is where I’ve gotten my handmade plans wayback when it was hard to find. 
---
I am aware of that, a high level legendary with the same rolls will be better than a lower level one. That is what I was trying to say. Please read
---
Maybe a set DR not scaled?  Make it final boss hard like you said but not scale to everyone.
---
In my inventory it's just Bomber Jacket.
---
My reticule range is sufficient to grab them. Does it make you target the bed? You can just shoot them.
---
I want the mosaic tiles or whatever to be back. I was working a lot of overtime when they were in the store
---
Update: I encountered 5 Mothmen now. Still no Flatwoods Monsters.
---
My camp is also close to there and I do a similar run in two legs
---
1.	Camp -&gt; Top of the World, Whitespring -&gt; Whitespring Bunker (and I pick up Technical Data from the bunker desks in the military wing) -&gt; Lewisburg (this isn’t the most cost effective way of getting a Responder location but I’ve seen Excavator mods here and I’m still trying to get a bright headlamp mod, since the plans for they don’t seem to exist). 
---
2.	Back to camp -&gt; Harper’s Ferry -&gt; Camp Venture to drop off the Technical Data -&gt; Watoga (Phoenix) -&gt; Watoga Station. 
---
I don’t think that solves the issue.  People can be level nothing rushed to general by teammates. 
---
Pics for proof
---
Ban wave bruh
---
I like breaking into ppls camps that are nothing but foundation. For those who think their isn't a way....oooo theirs a way 
---
Any pics?
---
I’m waiting for when they will eventually  release a ghillie suit
---
The fact that people are downvoting everyone recommending not to buy it says a lot about this sub.
---
Post the same topic on the PS4 subreddit, or even general Fallout one. Here you're going to get a bunch of people telling you how amazing the game is, the problems are exaggerated or don't exist, it's SO FUN with friends, etc.
---
There's nothing wrong with liking Fallout 76, but those people are in a very small minority for a reason. But yeah, please make this topic on an unbiased subreddit before spending your money on a game after asking a bunch of die-hards if it's worth buying or not. 
---
If you want my personal opinion, I've spent time in game development and this is what games look like roughly a year ahead of release. Solid foundation, but very little actual substance and buggy as hell. For that reason, I can't recommend the game. There are just too many good games out there to dump a bunch of time into one that feels like unpaid work most of the time.
---
There are factions out there ,just not in game , search around on discord as I’ve seen many.
---
Vendor run (all 7 factions), 
---
then farm a little bit, 
---
craft a little bit, 
---
do some events and do some quests, 
---
explore.  
---
Along the way help out any lower levels I see. 
---
At the end of the night I’m *almost* over encumbered and can’t sell anything so I log off at the first of my vendor run for tomorrow  
---
Ginseng is so rare to find and I can't grow it 😤😤😤
---
1. As a 43 level player with over 70 hours in the game I didn't notice any *game-breaking* bugs. Of course you have the minor bugs, but not anything game-breaking.
---
2. Atoms are earned through in-game achievements. Yes, you can buy them with real currency, but don't do it.
---
3.It's probably the best community you will ever encounter in a multiplayer game. Bethesda is known for having a friendly and cooperative community thanks to mods that other players create. If you played other Bethesda games, you know what I'm talking about.
---
Hope I gave you atleast a little bit of perspective about the game so you can decide whether is worth it or not :)
---
If you’re a fan of fallout, I think it lives up to the Bethesda fallout franchise in this state.  The only thing it’s pretty much missing is the “choose your own adventure”-ish decision making and karma-related things you could do in quests in FO3, NV, and FO4.  Maybe they’ll bring it in, but I personally love being free to do whatever you want without worrying about entire faction being pissed at you and being locked out of certain things based on your decisions.  It’s a nice change imo, even if for a short time. 
---
I thought i had some but i dont i must of dropped it clearing inventory i can help you drop a nuke wherever i think i seen cobalt on trees in whitesprings area not sure just check what flora gives cobalt first all the other stuff u need u can collect from dead enemies even ones you didnt kill. Ill help u gather too. My gt is bombo420
---
Whitesprings is the only place I've ever found it
---
God Bless you OP
---
But the mod dosent even show up
---
Given the variation in what she's up against, she pretty much has to scale.
---
I don't live in WV - have only passed through - but I love Helvetia in the game. I've got my latest camp built as a covered bridge over the stream through town.
---
Anyhow, my bigger point is that I advocate repopulating Helvetia as a center of operations. It's an easy, picturesque town to build near. The Scorched are easy to take out and aren't more than a nuisance. It's not far from The Whitespring at all. And as long as we all remain scattered throughout the wastes in remote little outposts we're never going to take any one part of it back. 
---
If we focus on Helvetia and build out around it, we can have ourselves a town, facilitate trade, and restore some semblance of civilization. The factions that exist in the game don't matter. The BoS, Enclave, Responders, Raiders - none of them were successful - all we're doing is running around completing their Hail Mary quests and they all died anyway. We shouldn't be trying to emulate them in any way.
---
I say rebuild in Helvetia. 
---
I can't tell you how many times I got "stuck" in the game, and used this technique to get out
---
When you pass lvl 70 the damage scaling is damaged. Im lvl 125, my friends are 50 and 57, they can take more hits in regular metal armor than i can in X01 PA. 
---
It’s a paradox just the way it is 
---
There usually two of them at Dabney Homestead. Equip green thumb to double your plant harvesting. 
---
What do you mean? Level or gear scale?
---
Or packaged foods (Salisbury Steaks, Blambo, etc) without needing to capture Sunshine Meadows.
---
i'd love you to try get into my Foundation Camp you will never get inside :)
---
I've to do a rebuild soon anyway. I found loads of plans, including the reactor generator.
---
I saw a base like this last night, got in easy and well.....
---
Got a video a certain action triggered the event 
---
You mean set a scale that doesn't take players below a certain level into account?  That would probably work too.
---
Some cases the dupes are worthless.  Duplicates of travel agent or woodchopper are useless.    I was surprised you could get a dupe of those.   
---
If you're sure it's the right mod for the right armor, no idea, sorry.
---
That's one of two places I found them. Just would be nice to be able to grow it. 
---
Any caps is a good deal. Anti armor doesn't effect energy weapons and the Gatling laser specifically has reduced benefit from explosive. Explosive does add a blast radius to your damage but doesn't actually increase the damage like it should and does on every other weapon.
---
Ooh, at Whitesprings? Now I know of three places to find it
---
I asked and they sent me the specific items I had "exploited". It was all ammo and junk that I don't even use so Idk how I was exploiting them. They said I had over a million fuel which I have never picked up in my life. It took about 7 hours between responses but I have had 3 so far already in 2 days.
---
Doesn’t it seem odd to you that prewar restaurants were using dog food
---
Can confirm, it’s a ban. I got hit as well.
---
You're very welcome.
---
cool. ill get back to u when i get home.
---
sorry not home right now. ill message back when i am.
---
Good shit, lad
---
Can you post pics of your covered bridge? I’ve been thinking of moving my camp closer to Helvetia, originally planned a wall near one of the entrances with turrets to help hold off the scorched
---
I’m really eager for them to add faction system so I can make a Helvetian Guard faction that has Swiss-Germanic roots and is emplaced in Helvetia
---
Fair enough, I just meant in comparison to the actual single trigger pull automatic weapons. Technically the gatling was rapid fire bit still depended on the speed of the operator for repetitive action. No idea why I'm getting downvoted.
---
Hey man, I just discovered this, can I get a updated Discord link, if this things still going? Sorry for any inconvenience 
---
I'm positive, if I go to the vendor in Watoga it says I have it
---
I tend to drop all my unwanted ammo and building supplies in the artisan corner register at Whitesprings. for plans I like to check the map for a low level person and give them over directly, just seems a shame for plans to disappear in the world. 
---
Just tried the normal barrel, getting 31 dmg I think it was but the ROF is extreme, does melt stuff so fast the servers don't register it properly, I can let go of the trigger a second early and they still die :D
---
Durability is still the same amount of shots, but it does fire like 5-6 times faster. Maybe it would last one fight with the SBQ :P Found a furious 50cal today as well, that thing just keeps going and going with insane sustained DPS! 
---
In fallout 76, someone might try and kill you while you're doing quests, there's a junk reward if someone kills you. By your logic, there's a game right there with pretty similar PvP mechanics to dark souls, the only difference being dark souls is a good game, and 76 is awful. 
---
Dark souls can afford to have a shitty PvP system because it's an afterthought. There's much more to the game then just pvp. 
---
&gt;Dark souls is balanced
---
That's pretty much the only difference between the two. That's literally all that matters.
---
Double dmg if the enemy is at full hp.
---
I'm 2 caps jump from west tek. its my farm spot. Best part is if i leave the area and come back it respawns. i don't even bother going in sometimes because i'm just farming guns to sell usually, but inside is insane. safer to go in the back door because you can get absolutely swarmed going in the front. Just when you think you killed them all another wave comes out of nowhere it seems. 
---
I’ve wanted this for a while. Tried spending a few hours server hopping. Didn’t work. Back in December I moved my camp just outside the area of the bunker. EVERY DAY I’ve logged in, first order was to check the enclave vendor. To this day the vendor has never had it. From what I have read, I’ve come across maybe 50% of what’s available. the stealth boy is a pretty rare item and I’ve seen it 3 times. But never the jet pack. It’s been 12 weeks logging in looking. The RNG sucks ass. I just bought it off another member. 1k, was a good deal. 
---
I'd just make a run at Flatwoods to gather a bit of them. Equip green thumb when harvesting and super duper when cooking. That's about all the advice I can give. But, yeah, we should be able to grow all the flora and fauna we find. 
---
kill schorchbeats
---
Holy shit man you just brought back some ff11 memories with "train to zone"
---
Man, watching that trailer was awesome. My girlfriend and her sister were even interested until they saw it was Fallout. 
---
Thanks ecko
---
I personally use the overseer's camp. That way some newbies can get some stuff for sure right odd the bat.  
---
Edit: Just now I experienced a game-breaking glitch where my pip boy froze and I died from ghouls.
---
Yes they can. Set up camp on a mole rat spawn point. I could loot their bodies for meat every time I traveled back.
---
Same my outta PA numbers are 450 ballistic 500 energy 200 rad unless I'm in a nuke zone I'm solid
---
Awesome, thankya
---
I have 2 accounts. When i want to move stuff i open a 2nd game. gotta drop settings to lowest.
---
Just had something similar this evening.
---
Started a new character a few days ago, going for a melle build as they seem far better than my normal sniper build I would go for, no constantly farming ammo, and they actually pack a punch.
---
About level 12 or so, I'm going around exploring the forest area. Unlocking new areas on the map and claiming workshops for the rewards and plans. Start at the airfield and work my way back up to the prison and then towards the coast, back down towards the food processing plant. Probably have about five workshops so occasionally popping back to defend them.
---
Have a quick look on the map as a couple that were claimed are now free, due to the owners logging off. Having a scan of the map I see there is nobody in the forest or the Ash Heap.
---
Looking into it more, there are only two other players on the whole map, both fairly high level (compared to me) over the other side of the map completely.
---
It was nice, it felt like a normal single player fallout game rather than online.
---
The only downside is that when I next play I will have to try and grab some workshops again.
---
Ffs if you think that's hard, you want to try going for the Gauss suppressor! 
---
I lost one of my turrets in my c.a.m.p this morning, repaired it but it didn't reappear. I had to remove a roof piece to bring it back. So the bug that was there on release of the game may be back?
---
I'll help 
---
Add me

---
From my experience they seem to stack. I have 267 AP and going from 0 to full takes roughly 6-7 seconds. Thats using lone wanderer AP regen and 2/3 AP refresh on gear.
---
Its weird to me that they dont advertise it at all either. Like they dont even post it on Twitter. I just have to be lucky and hope I'm on when something shows up that I like. Really a bad idea if they want to make money off of the atomic shop.
---
I just bought the fusion generator plans at Harpers for like 200 caps. Best money I've ever spent just so I don't have to do the plant quests ever again. 
---
I follow this excellent guide from our fellow man:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ab81e3/fusion_core_farming_tips/
---
Nets me about 10 in 30min 
---
Ive had a tough time finding decent armor what is your charisma/luck. I want some sentiel armor.
---
You can also place your power armor inside and enter it
---
I guess they don't look much different to me lit or not and they were lit the whole time
---
Appreciated!
---
I forgot belching Betty.  Remembered it as t-60!
---
I'll help.
---
Thanks - I found one finally. I was hoping for the plans, but this will have to do.
---
Add me, thanks
---
AND there's a stash box there as well to easily transfer your extra stuff.
---
I've just fast travelled to Watoga Train Station, logged out, will add you now :)
---
It's to deter against NPCs, they have to follow a certain pathfinding and they seem to ignore foundations
---
Good doggy and can do a winning  combo !! I miss the mre meals in fallout new Vegas !! all a growing , hard killing  , Power armor rocking wastelander needs for yum yums !!! 
---
Nice I have completed it, I figure it was like white springs where the robots attack you if you attack them. 
---
I'm in! ryanburns003 is my psn
---
Well...I did not get any messages but thanks to a few guys on the servers we killed the queen. Good times had.
---
Cool, I'm just chillin in the silo. 
---
Speed demon is a must
---
They should make it like in Fallout 4 where they have grape, orange ex.
---
Them the server crashed. We lose our houses. What a good damn game
---
Lol ok
---
By the time the Watoga bots and Phoenix meet each other, you'll have already killed all of the Watoga bots in the area. Protectrons are slow so it's way faster if you kill them all as soon as they aggro Phoenix
---
Unsportsmanlike pvp
---
People say "I've gotten 100 hours worth or 200 hours worth." Before they got bored as way to say the game was worth their money. Which is fair, if you don't want to account for the fact lots of people have been able to put 1000+ hours into previous fallouts without the feeling of getting bored. Sure mods have helped the game but I've seen people replay vanilla fallouts like NV simply to try those factions they were locked out of. People are leaving 76 without even creating a new character because the content is so lacking. That speaks volumes of the lack of story and content this fallout has compared to previous games. As it stands there is no reason to create more than 1 character whatsoever. Seeing as how you can 1. Change special point allocation 2. Have your character transfer over to PvP servers and 3. There is no story/plot point that would compel you to do so. In fact after you complete the "story" you most likely would find doing it again a chore. If you're a fan of the fallout series you would know this does not even come close to living up the the fallout franchise whatsoever. 
---
Until they add more content I would not recommend buying the game if you're a fan of fallout. 
---
I actually had my first griefing last week. I spent a few hours questing. Gathered a bunch of junk and sold what I could. But I had so damn much I couldn’t stash it. No problem, I was already done for the night. Went back to camp started repairing my shit. 10 minutes later I hear someone jumping outside my camp walls. Check the map an there’s definitely someone outside. They aren’t emoting or anything so I went back to repairing. Next think I know the asshole has picked my locks and is running around inside my camp. I just stood there and waited for him to say something. He just ran around trying to hide from my turrets and healing himself. I figured maybe he really needed to access a stash or something so I emote hello. He walks to the other side and starts to smash my camp walls. I get pissed, jump into my PA and get ready to thump the guy and another player comes outta no where and smashes me. Like 1 shot dead. 
---
I couldn’t be bothered with PvP in this game. It’s broken and makes no sense. If I wanted PVP I’d play a PvP centric game like Apex. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019
---
I had that this evening.
---
I'm doing a melle character and was passing through and saw somebody had a camp set up nearby, they dropped me some plans for armour, I dropped them a load of ammo. Even if they don't use it personally they are obviously set up on that location to give new players a head start and I'm sure it will go to a good cause.
---
I'm in.
---
Do you want help in the silo?
---
Sounds helpful
---
Well I’m probably banned. Smfh this is stupid 
---
Yes, directly into the building.
---
Before setting up the layout fast travel/log in a few times and see where the game places you then build the camp in such fashion that the spot is inside the walls.
---
I much preferred having nice, decorated and open places people could visit and use but repairing decontamination arches got old fast.
---
Lol I don't think I ever even seen a Gauss yet
---
I've finished the silo. Waiting to launch. It seems like we're the only people in this server. Unless I'm just all lagged out.
---
Trade or drop off for noobies 👍
---
-8% damage from players per piece for assassin, -15% damage while standing still for sentinel and while sprinting for cavalier
---
a couple weeks ago for one play session on one server only I was getting drops of 20-34 every 10-15 mins for maybe about 2 hours on xbox 
---
I was grabbing a beer and missed the team invite
---
It doesn’t make any sense, I know dupers that are online rn and non duper’s that can’t login 🤔
---
Slocum joes bear overseers camp there's 3 next to bus..and maybe 3 around the building..get them.. server hop do it all over again 
---
True statements, both of mine. Do some research about the bobbles. I believed the same as you till I saw for myself.
---
I honestly have no fucking clue. I guess to see if I'm proven wrong? Haven't been so far.
---
4 charisma and 9 luck throughout almost all of my time played. My current armor isn't that good as far as primary affix. Its a mix of chameleon, cloaking, life saving etc. Random primaries but with sentinel. Ideally id love a full set of Unyielding/Sentinel but Ive never seen a single one of those drop.
---
Thx for the tip I never knew that
---
ooo. I've got to try this route
---
Lmao gon be real with you. sony sometimes an asshole.
---
Nice! I didn't know that. 
---
Daily quest at the Giant Teapot, requires 10 honey.
---
Skip to 0:35 I drop a certain something and he appears behind my buddy to ambush us later a few seconds watch and comment 
---
If you refer to the exiting power armor glitch there are also ways to counter that :)
---
I can’t believe how many people carry a shit load of junk. I killed a wanted level 58 player yesterday, he had over 200 pounds of junk...... ballistic fibre, stable flux, 1200 steel, hardened mass. I was instantly over encumbered and took forever to walk back to my camp. Now my stash and character are at max weigh. This is after a dropped and sold a bunch of shit. Word to the wise, if you are wanted. Stash your junk!!!!
---
Here we go!! 😁😀
---
everyone is still going for Assassin's Sentinels armor. im still unsure what is the "best" melee option.. im guessing bloodied with swing speed. 
---
Shit that never occured to me. Lifesaver.
---
Power armor and super sledge at the whitespring with everyone else to level up. 
---
Everquest...  damn zone trainers!
---
I usually log in, if I'm going to do my vendor run and don't have anything to sell i hop to west tek, grab enough stuff then hit flatwoods and sutton then camp mcclintock if i need springs. Then i pop back to west tek, its respawned, I then hit either watoga or the enclave spots, then harpers then back to west tek. takes under an hour to farm 1400 caps,
---
No joke. PvP is just the best way to get an ungodly amount of mats but it's kinda like a lottery.
---
