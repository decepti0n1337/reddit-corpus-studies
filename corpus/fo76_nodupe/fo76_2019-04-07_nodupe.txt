I'm 36yo, old gamer, but I have 0 issues with the shop. It's there, I use it with the atoms I gain playing, period.

---
&amp;#x200B;

Same as Magic Arena... is there a shop with real cash? Yeah. I use it? No. I still play Magic Arena? Yeah.

Here’s the link to my mad bomber. I use pistols, but it can work with any secondary weapon. Mostly you jump around and blow stuff up.

I might actually spend real world money on something like this.. 
---
As a uni student I value every dollar.
---
I actually have really good boxing gloves for player fights. Bloodied +power attack damage, etc. I only keep them in the hopes that I can do something like this on pc one day.
---
I like this idea but now I’ll have to clean out my inventory ore often XP
---
It's expensive, but those guys ganking you are rolling with very expensive gear, too. 
---
I will IM you

Whoa, hold up. 40. As in you own 40 sets of power armor. 40 individual chassis, 400 carry weight, half of your stash? Why? I get collecting complete sets but why would you want that many? Even if you had every power armor paint that would still be too much. I feel like this is why there's so much server instability still, everyone and their mother hoarding so many things they'll never need or use, and carrying them around everywhere. I don't want to sound like I'm telling people how to play because I'm really not, you do you, but I wish people wouldn't break the game for everyone else by trying to hoard.
---
Coding that has never been done in a Bethesda Game. Would be a completely new experience for them to do something like that. Let em time to actually fix the game :D
---
Advance Power Connectors can be bought from vendors in Watoga and Harper's Ferry.
---
Power Armor Station plans can be earned by finishing the Excavator Power Armor quest Miner Miracles (level 25+).  I believe it can be also purchased sometimes at maybe... Phoenix?  I cannot recall exactly as I got mine from the quest.
---
Not sure on Cooking Stove, I have had it forever it seems, so many vendors may carry it but I never look at known plans anymore.
---
I might just have to grind legendaries or trade to lower the price. Once we get the new vendors at WS, grinding for caps will be easier.
---
That's my bet. Otherwise I would stash all my extra garbage in the vending machine with an insanely high pricetag.
---
I guess I missed those. Still, Digital would be cool.
---
Its the complete opposite for me. His higher % numbers for the apparel are my lows and vis a vis. Then again my rng in this game is straight trash so that can have something to do with it as well. 
---
It will. Just letting you know what you're getting into so you're not unexpectedly frustrated when you see the prices. 
---
That's just Texas-lite 
---
I saw one on the market. Wasn't combat armor and was still 8K. Lol
---
I have about 3 left in my stash. When I remove one the quest doesn’t start, but I am able to drop it, pick it up, then the quest begins.
---
Digital would be very cool.  
---
You never go full Ghoul.
---
Cool. My GT is Schwiftywhisper. Add me, I'm at my camp
---
Do you have another picture? This is one restricted for me. ( I have a filter that doesn’t allow me to look at anything that has a single curse word)
---
I'm only 28 but I've been around since before playstation, having to own Atari or go to the Arcade to play was just how it was. I have no idea when it first happened but hearing of games that could get you in the #1 spot if you paid enough money sounded scuzzy and I wasnt a fan. Actually playing those games? Forget it. You just get wasted by the $300 players all day, no thanks. I see shops in every game anymore, and cosmetic or not it still kinda sucks. 
---
But the thing about it is this: if there were no shops, there would be no online gaming, no updates content, etc. unless you had a paid subscription. Imagine if Bethesda and every other game developer required you to pay a membership fee (much like you already do to even use an xbox or ps4 online) to play each and every game in order to provide them with the funds to keep servers running? It would be awful. With shops you get the option to kick in money or not, and they still have their funding. If you kick in, you get a little token of their appreciation (whatever item you buy), and if you don't, you get to keep playing for free. So when its cosmetics only, I think it's the perfect balance. No in game buffs keeps the balance between players while still giving them something extra to look forward to buying, and still giving developers the funding they need. 
---
Shops are stupid in my opinion, I miss just getting the game and that being it. All inclusive, just have to go find it. Then the next game in the set comes out, you buy it, all inclusive, and that's it. It is cool to get more game for free just cuz other people want to pay instead of grind though. 
---
hey man - I got 3 serums from you a week or two ago... thanks for that, by the way!  :-)   
---
I could use calibrated shocks &amp; motion assist servos for Excavator.  Would love them for X-01 but looks like that's one you're still seeking, too.  
---
I'll try to catch you online soon and see if we can get it done.  Can bring materials, of course.  Will look for you - thanks!
---
No spoken like a person that dissent accept other peoples inteptitudes 
---
Not really.
---
I think it shows a divide between the effort needed to create a game. Back when you and I were young, Nintendo games were $40-60, and had maybe a handful of programmers (Super Mario Brothers had six people, for everything). Now, games have massive teams to create the modern, insanely complicated game, some of them requiring continually running servers... and we still pay $40-60. The market may be bigger, but all those people need to be paid. It does not help that today's profits help fund tomorrow's games, so profit is a much bigger deal than in our days.
---
What gets me is how many folks confuse *want* and *need*. For example, Fallout 76 gives you what you *need* to enjoy and play, and offers things you might want in exchange for more money (or a great deal of effort). Meanwhile, you get something like Robocraft, that used to hide every item in loot boxes, requiring you to grind with subpar weapons in the hopes of finally getting something useful, or you could give into the temptation and buy a pile of boxes and hope for the best.
---
From my point of view, the latter is predatory. You cannot play the game in a meaningful way without spending money. Meanwhile, games like Fallout 76 or TF2, you can get along just fine without any additional purchase (yes, even with the repair kits. Or was the game uplayable without them?)
---
Your son also does not have an adult's conservation of resources (or, if you want to use old guy terminology, he "doesn't know the value of a dollar," from the point of view of someone who has to spend dollars on needs). Kids of any generation are generally the same, they don't see tomorrow as important as today. And unlike you, he realizes that atoms are meant to be spent on an inherent level. I don't know about you, but I tend to save potions and super stims for that moment when they could save my ass, only to never use them and instead find 50 friggen pounds of super stims later because I didn't want to use them just in case. I am generally the same way with in-game currency, I treat every purchase as if it matters, as if it lasts, as if it has meaning. I sat on my atoms for months until I embraced the reality that I don't need anything, so I may as well have something.
---
I don't think it's your son being gullable or wasteful, nor do I think it's as simple as "bad guy game companies greed greed arrrgh." Well... usually (fuck EA). It's just the reality of the industry, big money in, big money out, and if big money stops coming in, EA buys the friggen IP owners and kills it. Does that mean every cash shop is acceptable? No. There \*are\* predatory systems, things where they halt gameplay unless you pay, and that's garbage (many mobile games are like that, you *could* stop playing for a day or pay up, and that halts gameplay), or things where they dangle sweet deals for you to be able to play the full game. EA's early SW BF II was exactly this, and people rightly flipped.
---
So long as I need not pay atoms to access and play the game fully, I'll be content. Sure, I wish I had that sweet blackbird paint (100 atoms short xD), but I don't *need* it to be happy.
---
New to game...I will not be doing any building beyond what is absolutely necessary until this is stopped...my time is too valuable and my emotional health valuable as well...I play for me...if game upsets me...I just don't play...plenty else to do and plenty other games to pick from.
---
Oof I have two mini guns I could have given you. One has tse with faster movement speed. The other is just a two shot. I'm on ps4 
---
HOLY COW! The Bethesda gods have heard my cries! I just landed the T-60 BOS Knight Paint! My first! Woo hoo!
---
Pity roll, I know it! lol
---
I've been on the hunt for Calibrated Sjocks for my X-01 since day 1 of getting it...I've found multiple ones for T-60 though...
---
Yeah, I want the full set more so I can interchange with other sets if need be. But for certain items there are ways to bypass the cap, like with weightless armor you can use the (additive) lightweight mods to drop it down to 0. Weightless weapons also have 1% of their base weight + 10% of the weight of their mods
---
I actually own 42 complete level matching sets. The only one at all that I'm missing is level 35 raider. And I'm not sure why I have so many, I just love collecting them I guess. It started with 1 of every set, then I wanted 1 of every level for every set, and during that I figured I might as well keep a bunch of extras incase I find people that are missing parts or could use an upgrade since I was getting so many parts I didn't need, (I'm just gonna ignore the different paints factor..) And it progressed into this collection. At the moment I'm kinda just giving out pieces and sets to people that I find that are nice or just new players. So that I stay around the same number. Also if I keep them all on me, it's only 100 carry weight with portable power I think is the perk
---
I always use the veil..and afterwards, it makes a great doily for my tea..
---
I've crafter and scraped over 200 and still don't have the long range recon scope for it. I know it exists since I have it in mine currently via a mod. But if u want to change for a Better one on stuck. Haven't for a new plan in over 40 scraps so far. The last one I got was the suppressor.
---
i can see it being used to send shit post messages all over the server. including dead memess

Not true, both Battlefront and Battlefield didn't reach expected sales. 
---
Damn we need cross platform 
---
No kidding? The excavator quest? Nice! That is great to hear because the station is so expensive. Still might be better to buy though, I couldn't stand farming all those components.
---
I also remember finding the Cooking Stove on an alt. That was way back before the Vendor reshuffle, though.
---
Play One Violent Night and make sure not to build the ‘music meter’ too fast (so you get ghoul pileup for a full 20 minutes. You’ll end up knee-deep in chems (and meat piles). 
---
I hardly ever use chems but have so many it’s ridiculous. That plus collecting legendaries to compare different versions of weapons fills up a stash pretty fast
---
[removed]
---
Use class freak too.  It’s only -1 then.  🙂
---
It does drop. I have 4 of them. 
---
Lol! Too true. I use it whenever I'm creeping behind people so they can be gettin' creeped on by a creeper...
---
They're better off working for a different company anyway.
---
Still didnt solve the camper problem
---
No it isn't working as intended. The developers have continually shown that they have no idea what is in their own game or how it effects game play.
---
That's why people were able dupe items by the thousands.
---
  
---
That's why two-shot explosive weapons were nerfed, 
---
That's why heavy weapons were buffed. 
---
They  released heavy weapons in a state where they were incredibly weak, a fact which Bethesda was completely unaware of until months after release.
---
Same.  I have 4 T-60 calibrated shocks sitting in my inventory.  Took me a couple months to finally get two for my X01.  But I got 2 for my Excavator right away by server hopping at Harper's Ferry for a long time.
---
Yes, they do spring up here and there.
---
use class freak.. and then get more then 1 mutation.
---
1. Destroy someone's camp, get a huge bounty on your head.  
---
2. Wait for someone to show up wanting to claim the bounty.  
---
3. Once they engage, have your friend who's been hiding in the bushes kill them and collect their stuff.  
---
4. Rinse, repeat.
---
Rose is fine and all, but i kinda like more of the idea of the insult bot as the host. Maybe both? (One for appalachia and the other for classical)
---
If someone has a bounty they should not be safe in their camp...no lock should be able to protect them... their camp should become, let's say 20% vulnerable to damage....or scale to the amount of their bounty.
---
Tbh, I’m a high level end-game PvP player, and the last patch ruined melees ability to compete in end-game match ups. 
---
Melees been devastated by the last patch. There is no countering those handmade builds.
---
Stealthboys, and don’t get shot
---
Yeah I am a fan too. I didn't buy this game but I was just about to and I am so glad I dodged this bullet. It's sad to see a once great company sink this fast. It hurts to see a franchise dragged down like this.
---
I’m 37 and have no issue with it. I work a job that prevents me from being able to play for huge segments. Buying shit for another dollar means nothing to me. The 5$ that upset you is 15 minutes of work to me. 
---
I question your thesis based on that fact alone.
---
Are we talking about the aviator paint for the fat man? I'm looking at it in the atom shop right now and it costs 1000
---
Yeah it sucks. 
---
Been there done this.  👍^^^*
---
But if you are invulnerable, how long does it last. Is it enough to get a decent amount of space between waiting players ?
---
Never mind 
---
But thanks dude! 
---
Maybe they'll fall, like Interplay, and another company will buy it. Fingers crossed it's CDPR :D
---
Doesn’t matter. Might as well jump!
---
That was patched a while ago.
---
When I have the stash full I find a low level player, better I'd it is camp and drop 100p of unnecessary stuff. 
---
When you say effect your results you mean the XP you get from crafting ammo? AFAIK that's all intelligence would effect there. I find it really negligible at high levels and I'm just happy to make lots of ammo.
---
I have 9 Int and recently got Marsupial. The negative effect was too much for me and I had to get Class Freak to even it out. With 15 to start it really wouldn't be that bad.
---
Borderland has suffered far worse and been sold to the triple E... the Epic Evil Empire
---
Yeah, once the kinks got worked out, I ended up playing alot of NV. Probably more than Fallout 3/Oblivion. 
---
I really enjoyed the setup, felt like it was a unique take on the lone wanderer idea. 
---
There are few games that really provided me motive to accomplish something, and New Vegas made me want to hunt down the person who shot me. 
---
It’s difficult to obtain, but there’s a theme park mascot costume you can get, a full cat fur-suit.
---
The Mr Fuzzy Suit thing?
---
I thought I had posted a reply already but don’t see it - it was from my phone so maybe didn’t post so I’ll try here.
---
Concentrated Fire is good - though less so with such a low Agility. That said, you probably want those 3 points to swap in Glow Sighted.
---
What I didn’t call out here are the swaps - once you get these cards you are going to want to get some swap cards too mostly for scraping, crafting, repairing but also situational. That’s likely at least White Knight (normal armor), Power Patcher and Fix It Good (power armor), Ammosmith, Super Duper, Chemist and if you’re going energy weapons Science (whatever you need to put mods on a Gauss). If you find an explosive, you’ll want to swap in Demo Expert 5 eventually instead of Makeshift / Gunsmith.
---
For weight reduction, it’s best to pick what you’ll use and build around that. The best straight weight reduction these days is likely Thru Hiker, just because of how fast crap is spoiling and the great many things focusing on alcohol brewing. Traveling Pharmacy is also handy, but you can get by without it and you don’t want to take away from your melee effectiveness.
---
The real question for you - what kind of rifles will you be using?  If you are using standard ballistics that’s one thing, and I’d suggest NOT taking any weight reduction perks. If you were using Gauss, then I’d suggest you stick w/ energy ammo - Tesla Rifle, Ultracite/Laser Rifle. Batteries Included would also reduce weight from Fusion Cores, so also handy if you’re using PA. If you go that route, move some points into Intelligence for Batteries Included (likely the 3 from Concentrated Fire). 
---
No because I tested it u can chase them for about 10 second then just kill them then go back to the camping spot
---
Bit of advice: get heavy leather arms, heavy BOS combat armor chest, and heavy metal legs if you can - highest ballistic damage reductions per piece. Even if you stay away from the metal legs because of their lower energy damage resistance, the arms are definitely better. 
---
It effects your results in how much materials you get from scrapping - per the description of Intelligence. I'm not too worried about the XP at all.
---
It’s very easy to notice when it auto saves. It’s in the same place every other message pops up, top right hand corner, it will say “Checkpointed.” That’s how you know
---
You can go through life like that, or you can realize that you're the type of person who types "dissent" when they mean "doesn't," so maybe you are imperfect like the rest of us.
---
Yeah, it was fun being able to kill him with his own gun too or teaming up with the guy who shot you. I played it a lot my favorite part was how they had different ammo types that you could swap to on a dime for just about every gun.
---
I think I have about 500 5.56 ammo, you are welcome to it, I don't use it. PSN squintmanatee42
---
You are incapable to appreciate the extent of own intellectual inferiority, no point for me to educate a pigeon, bye.
---
A handful of unopened vaults...but I'm sure they are going to have dungeon/raids in most if not all of them.
---
Sure would be nice if (known) plans were at the bottom vs top. It's incredible some of the QOL overlooks in this game. 
---
You're awesome! I'll add you in a few minutes is that alright?
---
Yea that'd be great. Let me know if you have it for sure and what you'd want in trade. Thanks. 
---
I’m interested 
---
Thatd be cool. I'd just hate to have to do a protection mission if they wanted to go out. Too fast walking...too slow to run.
---
Let's see.
---
1 main account currently @750/800. Ammo crafter 3 power armor frames, 50 stims, 5 super stims 300+ extra plans ( I know get rid of them), I have no rockers,nukes or cores in my stash ( they are on my  toon (195/295). 
---
All my 4 alts are maxed 800/800 stash of crafting mats mostly lead and steel.
---
My second account has 3 alts on it with maxed out stashs full of 2 and 3* stuff for vending.
---
I am an avid altoholic and a card caring member of horders.-r-us. do I have an issue?
---
Which serum and quantity :)
---
I mean, they didn't set that price. That or $10 a month was the standard for MMOs for years before WoW came out. And yes, it paid for the servers, but also the staff maintaining those servers, including expensive game developers and systems administrators, and it paid for game designers, game devs, and project and personnel managers for development of the add-on content. I'm sure they also made a handsome profit, but I don't see why they should have just left money on the table like you're implying.
---
Yes, what we need to do is not buy any Bethesda games. That'll work for me alright.
---
I was going to replace it with Outer Worlds until they pulled that Epic crap.
---
So only people left are indie developers.
---
I posted a ticket and they just sent me a Walk through of the quest. As if that was remotely related to what I wanted from them.
---
Do you have talons? 
---
What do you mean?
---
Yeah my head was clearly in some alternate dimension where Bethesda actually does stuff
---
Loading Fallout right now, il check
---
Let me sit on my front porch holding a double barrel shotgun and a bottle of Nukashine so I can tell people that pass by my camp to “Keep walking boy.”
---
Camden park, vendor bot chad for the cooking stove plan. 
---
Could someone take pictures of the real turret CAMPS behind the golf club in real life? Curious how accurate they are to the ones in game.
---
I need to unload junk and aid daily from my PvP character. I don't get why people attack me with all this aluminum on them but I am grateful for it nevertheless. Or the guy who had so many stealthboys that I had to use a few just to get to the stash in the station they occupied.
---
My first two characters were before the vendors changed. It definitely made a mess of things. 
---
I had a problem with it, and it was fixed after a strange thing- I usually ported straight to Camden Park to try to trigger it with no luck, but then I ported into Welch one day and it popped up. After that, it pops every time I go back to Camden. Probably totally random and unrelated, but maybe worth a try.
---
For what it’s worth, the fireman helmet sometimes sold by the toy store robot in Whitesprings has breathing protection, but no PER penalty either. Good option if you like running around in Responder fire fighter gear. I’ve been told the doctor mask functions like the Veil as well, although it was by someone trying to buy my Veil at the time 😏
---
But yeah it is a bit inconsistent, anyway. 
---
Not the "keep everyone alive" aspect of the app. But more like a vault where everyone stayed inside for protection and only came out to trade or gather supplies.
---
Mostly marsupial and like 1-3
---
Never noticed , I’ve never had the problem of disappearing shit from my inventory and I’ve never payed any attention to auto save🤷🏼‍♂️
---
I'll be back on in about an hour at most. 
---
This is correct, it's just like games that sell xp "boosters" and then make the xp grind so horrible that you HAVE to buy the boosters just to play the game at a normal leveling pace.
---
I use a two-shot 10mm SMG (92 damage per shot) and 3500 rounds of 10mm won't last me long

I'm not overly concerned or outraged by repair kits. 
---
Everyone is assuming it's BGS trying to sneak their way up to true P2W, which could very well be the case, though I don't believe that. 
---
I feel like they are fully aware of the backlash that true pay to win items would generate. 
---
I feel like what they are actually doing is trying to feel out which mundane tasks they can monetize to try and capture some dollars from players who don't care about cosmetics. 
---
Like everyone's mentioning ammo conversion... If they limited it to non rare ammo, like converting 5mm to 308 at a cost of 3 to 1? Is that an advantage? Not really. Collecting ammo is mundane and just happens. We all drop 100's of rounds to free up space. 
---
I feel like BGS is just trying to see which of these mundane, non advantageous elements they can monetize, which I'm fine with. 
---
If the next step were a gun that truly gave someone an advantage I'd be more concerned. 
---
Second time it was mentioned. I need to go back and try that dlc. I left at the beginning of the island dlc.
---
Well give an update on what happened.
---
It’s a RNG game, it produces 3* as it’s expected to.  I guess I’m lucky but I thought it always produced a 1 then 2 then 3 star, until people complaining set me straight. 
---
The real issue is they are level 5 weapons , wtf ;) 
---
Thatd be interesting. Hard to communicate though.
---
It’s got the star and is chrome and yellow?
---
Anthem sold poorly, people have learned so it seems.
---
I guess my girls will get bored then. :(
---
shallow doesn't mean that the game doesn't have content, it just means the content stays about the same level of interest the whole game. 
---
Get your singles ready!

Thank you, you just saved me 500 atoms.
---
i can't seem to find you on xbox
---
The game is trash. Would love to have enjoyed it but disconnects, lurching movement, 8fps. It's just trash.
---
When was the last time you played this? I do remember it producing 3 stars back in the early days, but every single time I've played this in the last 2 months its been a plain wolf in the final phase.
---
It isn’t a guarantee. I have a camp just downriver from Dyer. Plenty of nights with all pods. Supposedly Heart of the Swamp event makes them open, but I haven’t had adequate opportunity to test that.
---
They've obviously been too busy working on ways to nickel and dime players to even think about working on player vending.
---
Marine Wetsuit Plan can be found in the train car west of Watoga Station and the barracks on the shelf by the fridge in Camp Venture.
---
Other places exist, and those two spots don't _always_ have the Wetsuit, but they do often enough to make a few server hops worth it.

They don't cut content due to time constraints and then sell it as DLC. That would be an absolute disaster if you tried that, pragmatically speaking. DLC is planned in advance, and it is funded based on anticipated income. If you convince companies to make DLC free, you won't be getting most DLC at all. AAA video games have been $60 retail for practically 20 years now. A $60 game in 2000 would cost $90 today and for half the amount of content. And we wonder why season passes are $30-40. It's because gamers refuse to pay more money for better, bigger games so publishers had to invent ways to keep up with inflation.
---
I'd drop it on Prime Fissure, myself.  I like that area better that Whitespring.

Theres that and the tattered mole outfit. Which is a dirty and partly ruined mascot outfit. Easier to get but not really as its a random spawn.

First, visible jumping TSE assassin sentinel are prey. They get easily one shot via Vats Crit that completely negates their armor. The real discussion is now how to play the hunger games, and the answer is that you don't really need expensive gear. Get yourself a S1 P15 E6 CX IX A15 L15 build, 1* bloodied combat/handmade rifle with automatic receivers, 1* unyielding armor set and these assassin sentinels jumping guys will be your food. The X for int and cha is because these depend on your team composition - I.e. I don't use lone wanderer at all so my cha is super low. There's a vast room for improvement in gear I specified but these crap items are enough to outmatch what's commonly considered meta.
---
Also, be aware that if your sneak is not defeated by enemy perception they can't vats you when you are sneaking, and that covert operative doesn't seem to work in PvP.
---
Except it is still happening. Maybe not to the same extent, but it is happening. It would just happen in the new mode, too. 
---
Your choices pretty much boil down to Fissure Site Prime or Whitesprings. FSP to trigger the Scorchbeast Queen fight and Whitesprings for level grinding/mass raw flux collection. The only reason you'd want to nuke anywhere else is boredom, desire to mess with other players, or you're in desperate need of a specific kind of flux. 
---
We paid for the box dude. Why they adding PTW shit to their shop. It's pure greed.
---
Broooooooo we got lucky today. I just found BoS legs at Top of the World on a bench! Now I just need chest! What is today?!?!
---
First of all, thanks for throwing in the random socialist jab. That's productive
---
Secondly, they've already nerfed XP in previous patches, nerfed white night and licensed plumber, and every nerf to damage is essentially a nerf to weapon condition (because more shots to kill = more condition loss per kill). Adrenal reaction broke because they were trying to stealth nerf it. It was no surprise that the TSE nerf was swiftly followed by complaints of weapon/armor maintenance, ammo crafting, and a myriad of 2nd order effects. 
---
Np let me know when ya get one.  I don't want to pester ya. 
---
I want to be able to sit on the toilet and read a magizine or look at my pipboy.

I don't doubt that. I only want my idea to be implemented when and if Bethesda is able to put a complete stop to it. 
---
I don't live in WV but do live in RI about an hour south of Boston and I travel there a lot for work. . While playing FO4 i was constantly amazed at how accurate the city was. 
---
That’s ironic I drove thru Charleston yesterday on a vacation trip and I wanted to see West Virginia so we drove thru and on our way I seen these landmarks and landscapes just like the game. There was a little 1 street ran down town that looked liked flatwoods to me. And oh my lord now I know why there not much flat or level ground.. because there is none in the real West Virginia. It’s ALLL MOUNTAINS. fantastic job recreating the shots!
---
Dune works good in savage Divide ;)
---
They could have released a more refined product by pushing back the launch and have a wider player base buying cosmetics rather than trying to cut their losses by implementing P2W mechanics with the remaining players because the game price has dropped drastically.
---
No problem. I like the way it looks but I mostly got mine for the goggles. I wish the store was better about that kind of thing. You should be able to properly preview a skin before you buy it. Before they had pictures I wasted atoms on the Vault-Tec logo statue not realizing it was gigantic. I bought it to fit on an end table...
---
Copy that stuck in traffic be there soon

Can confirm BoS Legs at one of the benches, and pocketed combat chest at Top of the World

Power armor targets still appearing too far to the right.

Boris? Is that you or is this that sneaky anatoli
---
No problem 
---
You only sit in FO4 to kill time waiting for vendors to open. In 76 we should be able to eat and drink, play with your pip boy, play an instrument, shoot and emote from sitting position. I'd like to sit on my lakeside perch and watch the rain fall and pop the heads off of super mutants who mess up my corn patch.
---
Hope so. That was the best part of the 4 storyline.
---
Those fuckers were crazy.
---
When you have quality games like division 2 fallout 76 becomes at most an afterthought.  
---
A week or so ago, I forgot it only produced level 5 weapons, I bitched about it and people reminded me that low-levels need legendaries too 
---
Also the idea that they would need a specific low-level mission is kinda silly considering their track record at everything else.  
---
I will however try it again next time it pops up, and if it’s all single star or less I will apologize. 
---
 
---
That might not be so far fetched. Notice the timing on Steam review censorship, right at about the same time as the Epic store shenanigans.
---
Wood armor then you can be a Groot clone lol.
---
I'm guessing the enemies will scale, like in an event.  If you're doing Uranium Fever by yourself, you might kill a dozen enemies.  Once someone else joins, the number doubles or triples.
---
I personally like having friends around to boost the chances for three stars.
---
I'm sure a seasoned player with a good build and decent gear will be able to handle themselves.
---
Nevermind. That link was horrible. 
---
the red rocket workshop up in the northeast is a quick easy option. 
---
I don't think I've ever played an open world game that renders depending in the direction you're looking at so obviously though. I can tell that my CPU is doing a lot of the work though, because with my stock cooler I'm pushing 70-80 degrees most of the time in game while my GPU is getting 25-40% usage which some decent temps. Part of my high temps on my CPU could be because its slightly OC'd.
---
Ex-cavalier here, made a new char when it appeared to me that what easily ate 'meta' is outclassed by visibility a denying builds. Bloodied sneakers shred me in a blink by quick series of crit headshots. Can't beat em - join em.
---
That’s cool
---
Are the silos real
---
Top of the world (ski poles), fort defiance (surgical tray) Morgantown hs (tv dinner trays), harpers ferry (coolant caps on ac units)
---
I was trying to form the idea where the whitespring chef would pay for any foods brought in, with some kinda market behind it to de-value the popular things, but I think it’s way better story-wise to have it against a closed vault looking to trade.  
---
Oh yeah I've learned that the hard way with PUBG, unplayable at low settings but very playable at all ultra for some weird reason. I don't have any active antivirus, just Windows Defender but yeah I cleared out my main HDD before I transferred Fallout over to it by deleting ESO and a few other games I don't really play.
---
You must have gotten some weird looks walking around in a gas mask
---
Oh, with the nature of the delay between your character acquiring something client-side and it being saved on the server-side, it is never really going to be completely stopped. Someone will always find a way to exploit that. 
---
Oh hell yes. Or maybe they could just give Raider Radio some more music than the elevator Muzak soundtrack. I suppose she’d need more lines, but again I’d be all for that. There’s a use for micro transactions: buy 2 minutes of studio time for Rose’s voice actor and crew, 2000 Atoms!
---
I’d guess the reason we don’t have DJs here is that they were used to deliver news, praise or condemnation to the player in the solo games. Can’t do that here, of course. Things have to stay static. But seems like something entertaining could be done. 
---
I used to live in Beckley and Thurmond is one of my favorite places in the world. Great area for fishing, camping, mountain biking. Glad you got to check it out and totally agree it would have been awesome to see it in the game. 
---
Yeah its too wacky in an unoriginal and out of place way. The BOS outfits might be where to start but again those can be hard to come by. You just have to find that 1 item and go from there. An eyebot helmet or gas mask to start with. Dont see alot of users with those.
---
Plans? Civil war reeanactor. Or me, if you are on Ps4. 
---
Worst thing IMO is that pretty much all of the horde events (except this one) in the forest / savage divide / toxic valley / ash heap will give you lvl 5 up to lvl 25 3-star gear. But the one single horde event that has multiple stages with several bosses and a "alpha" at the end does not, what is that about?
---
It's an event drop. I don't think you can buy the shielded. I'll make you a BOS or Enclave one if you want. Just bring the mats. 
---
Ye I only do PvE 
---
Always down for more Fallout adventures. Xbox IgRageclaw23
---
i got a full set of 1 star unyielding gear that I use specifically for turning tech data in, crafting, etc. Since I'm a bloodied build, as soon as I hop out of my power armor all of my stats are 20+, and I'm assuming that the luck bonus caps at 20, since that's where the int bonus caps.
---
So I went to all vendors in Ash Heap. They are all Responders. They had quite a few similar goods.  They we're not exact though.
---
Also, I wish this kind of feature could be extended to water pumps.  If I have a lot of cooking to do, I hate having to sit there and pump...wait a few seconds...pump...etc.
---
What do you charge for elder paint? It's tradeable after right?
---
This is the only time I would ever think of using binoculars 
---
I mean, I'm lvl 175 and have a much harder time fighting a handful of lvl 40 crickets than I do a lvl 91 deathclaw.  The deathclaw I can shoot in the back of the head and move along.  Crickets are nightmare fuel for a sniper.
---
I kinda hope the enemies have some variety, because killing one scorched after another gets dull quickly.  Maybe a scorched section, a deathclaw nest, a few mirelurks in a flooded area, some glowing ghouls in an irradiated area, etc.
---
We stopped there last summer while biking the Greenbrier River Trail. Ate at Jack Horner’s in Seebert and then rode to check out the park. Super friendly area. We’re planning to do it again this summer and camp at Watoga (we’d overnighted a bit south of there last year). 
---
bravo
---
I can craft that later on tonight after I get home. May need ballistic fiber and Flux if you want it upgraded though. 
---
We need rock salt loads for shotgun shells to complete the ensemble.
---
I’ll pay for that two shot mini gun my gt is MU113T M4N
---
Palace of the winding path but lowest level is 15. I may be wrong but that’s one place 
---
Indeed as melee-fu person I observe that the only tactical viability that remained for my melee opponents was to resort to exploiting respawn protection timer and events "teammate" flagging system. I think automatic fire critical shots should be made less viable even though I am overencumbered with caps, aid and junk playing such build yields me. If automatic weapons critical shots did not multiply damage, but still kept penetrating the armor effects, we'd be in a situation where its possible to sustain fire from such weapon while in vats distance for few seconds, and not the blink of an eye. My opinion is that cavalier and sentinel people should be taken down with about a standard magazine if shot without obstructions in between. Now I'm able to take four of them in one magazine. It reduces the variety of viable play styles and I want to see and oppose variety of creative enemies, not armies of bloodied sneakers.
---
As an older gamer I don't hate the shops if they are cosmetic stuff only. I bought stuff from the Atom shop and would buy more if they made more stuff I want available for your CAMP. I think the older players are more outraged about the p2w aspect of online shops than the shops themselves. Young kids are used to scummy EA micro transaction type stuff where p2w is commonplace.
---
This is really my biggest gripe. I have to remind myself a lot that it’s a game and no one other than locals care that it’s geographically insane. 
---
Has anyone tried to close all 11? Cuz I've only seen videos of people closing of main three. Plus I'm kind of pissed off at myself having only just now found out that there are actually 15 fissure sites, four being inactive.
---
&gt; It's a RPG with shooter elements
---
Fallout 3 and NV were RPGs with shooter elements.  Fallout 4 and 76 are shooters with RPG elements.
---
I don't mind it all that much because I assume it costs a good chunk of money to keep the game going for years to come. The free added content is a big reason I'm totally okay with spending a bit of money here and there on cosmetic items, I want it to keep going the way it is and not have to pay a subscription fee instead.
---
Ah! All you do is get the app, and sign up super fast and easy once you get in by clicking the link I’ll send you the server we run has self explanatory info in channels that explains what to do as soon as you enter 
---
Oh my God. Such bad advice for vendor runs. Get you a top hat plan. Make about 40 or 50 hats. Takes one cloth for each hat. So to clear out one vendor costs about 6 or 7 cloth (and you can usually find that much cloth in each train station). Go to each vendor and sell them. 1400 caps a day, hardly any materials used. No effort. I do this every day, takes about 20 minutes. Save the chems for when you need them. Scrap guns you find (do you know how heavy they are?) to learn their mods rather than selling them. 
---
Former Beckley native who now lives in Blacksburg - the fact that what would be WVU in the game has a giant VT outside of it amuses me to no end. 
---
Which lowers your perception by 2 even though it’s basically the same thing as the atom shop version.
---
Let me explain sorry if I came off differently I'm not niave they are there for them to make money. I'm not saying they are bankrupt or even close all I'm saying is they are adding extra things that we don't need it's stuff that some people may want. As adults we should be able to decide between a want and a need. Also please don't think I am trying to say it doesn't suck a little but I don't think there should this much outrage but also everyone is entitled to their opinion. If your opinion is that it's too much extra money for you then you obviously have a right to complain it's your right to fight for your opinion. I stated my opinion and maybe I stated it poorly I don't know but I feel like maybe I did. 
---
Aha! This makes so much sense, thanks for the "grabbing a random item people don't usually grab" trick. That's guna make a huge difference!
---
I like that gt
---
Go to your junk tab, then sort by component view, and then mark them for search. 
---
At least that can be accelerated a bit by finding a river or pond, but ya, still takes a ton of clicking
---
Says that name can’t be found :( 
---
I sell stuff on the market all the time. So I get randos showing up all the time. When I'm in the middle of something. With all the stuff for sale on a different character on the other side of the map. Shoot me a message first people! That way I can finish up and get situated. 
---
What did the person you were selling to do OP?
---
What do want?  A medal?
---
Pick up every desk fan you see, Charleston Harold is a great place for them.
---
I believe nuclear war has more impact on the environment, why don't just play a game about that.
---
Maybe just a trusty pup keeping watch. 
---
Nvm found you lol 
---
I think I pretty much gave this one up to a low-level event.  
---
The weird gun mechanic in this game of needing to scrap every gun you find only really makes sense if you also get a lot of legendaries that you then mod with what you learned from the scrapped guns.  They need to push legendaries at you at a low level in order to make that work, and I think this mission was to do that.  
---
Oh it fails at that because of the time requirements, I always failed this one as a newbie because I never caught it in time.  
---
Just build in a desert with no trees lol
---
Ehh, I'll keep my fingers crossed and keep hoping.
---
Today was I want that gun make my way to the guy ..... oh it’s only level 40, I make sure that all relevant people info is visible or stated in conversation 
---
I feel that. I’ve been put into that situation as well. I especially realized it during “Key to the Past” where I’m supposed to kill “Freddie Lang” for Rosie. I’m level 20 and Freddie is in high 30’s/40’s (can’t remember). 
---
The repair related posts ive seen were all to do with the white night nerf. That's what seemed scuzzy to me. Patch in a problem, wait a month, sell the solution in the atom store.
---
You got it.  I might be able to get on in about 20 mins.  I'll let you know.  Otherwise it will be late night or tomorrow.
---
Morgantown isn't too bad 
---
Alright cool

I’m also 24 and play on Xbox. Usually play on weekends and sometimes during the week. GamerTag “DomingDaDreaded”. (Made the tag 10 years ago when I thought alliteration was cool af).  
---
In fact the continuous changes to game maths were a great work to nullify the dupers. When duping was common, the market was all about TSE Assassin Sentinel. This is a good PvE gear and perfect tool to exploit world of slap damage, but in real PvP it's not that beneficial. The gear that I'm now hunting for - and for me survival means free junk free aid and lots of caps - was commonly considered trash when duping was rampant - hell its still often considered crap and sold for pennies - and hence was never duped.
---
We already reached post-duping economy and the items that were favored then will slowly gain the public recognition as to what is their nature. And their nature is that most of the duped items are 3rd tier now.
---
But yeah I'd love a weekend where exterminators bashing damage weapons were not a possible drop.
---
Gamers who can remember quarter-munching arcades, and how PC- and console-gaming were a glorious reprieve from such insidious business models.
---
I've used it on the SBQ running a bloody build. Never died either. Just kept blasting away. 
---
Depends on what you want to use it for.   Midpoint to ease the cost of fast travel.    Resource gathering.  Water gathering.  Etc...

Do you mean 400 since they’re cheaper than that at the enclave bunker?

I pretty much live on dogfood
---
Balance was better before the last patch. Destroyed melee hit connectivity. Get rid of this “one-shot” nerf.  Make automatic weapons rebuild vats crits at least need 1 more shot for a 1-3-1 sort of thing. 
---
This stupid nerf made melee and snipers useless and made sentinel even more god.
---
And make stealthboys reveal if you attack or take damage. (This one is easy)
---
Your lag or server lag but it was for 100% a lag - there was a delay between your actions and the results that came seconds later. That's encyclopedic example of lag.
---
They tend to spawn late in the Queen encounter. Somewhere \~10 minutes left on the timer. More often than not it's the wave after the Mirelurk Queen shows up to take your lunch money.
---
I thought it was they werent putting in non cosmetics that buff the player....what does the repair kit buff? Armor? Accuracy? Health? Damage? The answer....it doesnt buff anything. Hell i see it as a cosmetic since it gets your weapon or armor looking brand new (I know there is no visual change)
---
I got lucky and another player killed him before I got there but now I’m stuck in a no heal/no food loop with high level enemies attacking me over and over again 
---
I think this is something they broke fairly recently, not long before they added booze crafting.  Previously you would do the 3 mini-bosses and then it would spawn the alpha and his pack, after killing the alpha the event would end.  Now the event ends after the third mini-boss is killed and a wolf horde event is generated in the area...
---
I can't really complain about getting 2 events for the price of one, but yeah the wolf horde boss should really be a legendary, as should all horde event bosses and Leader of the Pack should have it's original Alpha back.
---
Well they still have that closed area in the Whitespring bunker to open so there is future content coming.
---
OK thank you so much for responding! My Brahmin kicks me and turns red so I am sure you're right.
---
You know that standard mode still exists, right?  99% of the griefers moved into survival.
---
How is a repair kit pay to win?
---
Hey now! This gun is glitched! Every time I shoot a round, ammunition disappears from my inventory!
---
Thank you so much for replying! I appreciate you both taking the time.
---
Gotcha my boy don’t worry lol 
---
Unfortunately, I agree with what a lot of people are saying.   Bethesda as a company has moved away from their player base, and more in the direction of "profit greed" model that so many large companies fall into.  
---
I have been seeing a disturbing trend toward what I see as "another Ubi-Soft", with broken promises, unethical sales practices, and a lack of connection to their customer.  
---
First, they say "we don't like microtransactions", then they say "Well, we'll do microtransactions - but ONLY cosmetic", and now they're backing over that statement, too.  
---
Not good.    But, as so many say - no one cares, as long as they're entertained.  They'll continue to support by buying products even when they hate what the company does.  
---
If you don't like it, you have to take a firm stand.   Saying "I don't like that, but I'll keep buying your products" is simply being hypocritical.
---
They go to places where most players are, for example the fas’ event, that was one of their targets
---
Lmao that made my day thanks!!!!
---
Ya that is a shitty thing to do. Part of the problem is the lack of ballistic fiber and screws. Make the scarce and charge atoms to repair.....
---
They are 5000 at the bunker but whatever
---
Just realized I said "whars" lol sorry
---
But you're not making any effort to find out. It's pure laziness and just plain shitty behavior
---
Oh yeah, I was thinking with the Hard Bargain perk. My mistake 
---
Literally anywhere. You should get into the the habit of exploring and discovering for yourself. Ifs a lot more fun that way. 
---
If you do it at Prime make sure you make the zone a little north of Delta. This way you can use the walkway to mow down everything other than the QSB until she lands. Another item is to find someone with a mobile camp and set it up behind Delta. Need a stash and all workbenches.
---
Psn Luckyjayhawk add me please
---
You have to actually hit back in adventure mode to enable PvP now.  A rando can hit you all they want with whatever god-level weapon and it does no damage until you shoot back.  If you have pacifist enabled, you're safe even if they try to jump in front of your shot/swing.  They can't hurt you by blowing up cars around you or anything.  You have to actively go into your settings to engage.  It's great.
---
Melee weapons hit connectivity broken indeed.
---
Snipers are the king now, but you snipe with automatic rifle. Playable like a semi-auto even for distances longer than vats. Ultra viable and one of such mandatory in a team.
---
Sentinel is worthless without stealthboys. With stealthboys it still mostly looses against good snipers, as if you are not sneaking your compass dot is visible for miles, and if you sneak then you crouch which is definitely not standing and hence sentinel ceases to protect its wearer, making it useless.
---
Melee builds should receive some "charge" skill/effect/whatever that reduces your damage received for a while then reduces you damage done afterwards. Charge, penetrate, secure position playstyle.
---
Agreed on stealthboys being means to cover ground not to maintain invisibility while shooting. They should disappear if you shoot.
---
Prime locations could be high traffic as well as already taken so you might have to find a spot off the beaten path. I keep mine a good deal southeast of vault 76 to save on fast travel expenses. 
---
They should add a cash shop item to do this with since your pretty much cheating the system by doing it, might as well make it cash shop p2win.
---
How can you tell?  Damage?  Is it possible your regular armor has effects that are upping it?
---
WE NEED 1 MORE!
---
Definitely and I'm loving that. I do inventory management and trading on adventure, when I'm planning to leave my camp I go survival.
---
I don’t think they will do a reboot or reset players on legendaries. I think they will though listen to player feed back and only allow new characters to survival and nuclear winter later this year. 
---
Hate to be that guy but you can buy them from most other players for 100 to 300 caps 
---
sorry, when people talk about mule alts, they're normally talking about separate accounts so they can easily store it without another player.
---
A pack of Gulpers MF.
---
I love their channel and I think their shtick is kind of hilarious, so they're an exception to this for me...
---
If I'm totally honest I've seen a hundred different people make their characters in games as hideous as possible and screw around, breaking the game in the process. Half the streamers I watch did exactly that when 76 launched. Nearly any game where you create a character is like that. I'm kind of over it. It just feels super lazy and like going after low hanging fruit. Ha ha, I'm ugly, let's roleplay this ugly character. Where are the people who spend hours combining styles to make the right look?! Seriously, I'm legit asking.

Guaranteed spawn on the road north northeast of Harpers Ferry...sometimes a death claw too.

Yeah I thought about that after posting 😂 but you’re totally vulnerable out of the vault in survival mode so I was half right.
---
I solo'd one last week with a clown suit and a rolling pin.

Are you on PC? I can teach you how to make this game easy.

No. What are your tips?

4k is a rip off to anyone since you could just farm for the recipes which can be bought now for 1.25k

Form players and what not

No your ideas better!

Pull in more from shelter, I think that was the 76 austin studio thing right?   You should go there to get a pet, maybe some processed food from their hydroponics.   They could send you on radiant quests to revive their fallen explorers

If only all 73 of them that I had on me weren’t inserted for one reward the very first time I did it.  -___-

BoS combat leg spawned at Top of the World for me 30 mins ago
---
Had no idea what to sell them for. I've seen weapons go for ridiculous amounts so I figured I'd go for a big ask. Not to mention they are 5000 from the vendor soooooo
---
That's not very nice of you.
---
&gt;It’s called the Greenbrier in real life. An amazing resort.
---
Fun fact: it's owned by our current governor (who also still coaches the Greenbrier East HS girls basketball team in nearby Lewisburg AFAIK). 
---
Thanks...we can only hope Bethesda comes up with some interesting ideas with the vaults versus just all loot dungeons. Fingers crossed.
---
What kind of build are you running?
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-map-of-resource-deposits/
---
You might want to be strategic and put your camp on a resource node so you can stockpile certain things like lead or junk. Also having a water source nearby will be beneficial for using industrial water purifiers and mass collection of dirty water to boil.
---
I'm overloaded on screws but still grab fans on instinct. The lower level grind is real.

Hi, I'm removing your post not being specifically related to Fallout 76.

Consider posting it to r/Fallout!

I'm down. Usually on sundays thru Tuesdays.

Gt: Explozive Force 
---
There are actually a bunch of spots that this work. Central Cranberry Bog, Northern Mire, and Southern Savage divide have the most spacious underground spots. I picked my spot because it allows for a vertical wall which is aesthetically pleasing. The only thing missing is one of those doors to the free state bunkers and my RP will be complete.
---
Nothing specific. Mostly rifles and melee. White knight perk maxed and some other stuff.
---
On now.  Can you join?
---
Building your camp on a junk node can help but it’s much more efficient just to pick up certain items like desk fans while adventuring.
---
Oh I haven’t forgot it. I’m only lvl 78, and the grind for materials never really end. Now I’m always out of Ballistic Fiber... and if lower lvls think screws are hard to come by just fucking wait 😂😂😂
---
Not to mention ballistic fiber is found in specific locations, and everyone is always looting them. Sometimes you’ll have to server hop to get a server that hasn’t been cleaned out at the hot spots like Camp Venture and Fort Defiance.
---
Nice, there is a good chance I'll see you then.
---
That’s not nice of me?...

Do you have the armor piercing and 20% damage perks maxed for your weapon types? That helps a ton. I can't speak for regular armor - I pretty much live in my power armor.
---
There are a few around McClintock too, and one on the bridge by Flatwoods. I definitely hope it turns into something more than just pee-lights. 
---
Post it here 15 minutes or so before drop and you will plenty of help for the fight (usually).
---
Are foxes tameable? 🦊
---
I'm holding on to them until the legendary vendor drops; I'm hoping to turn them into something worth having soon.
---
Do they now give the small power generator to level 1 characters then?
---
Because all my characters start with it (I bought the Vault-tec skin).  And I swear I remember not getting that plan until the Morgantown quests originally.
---
Sorry about that I role play as a Mole Miner building inspector I accidentally loaded live missiles my bad.
---
I have the damage almost maxed but not armor piercing. You can't use melee in power armor right?
---
morgantowns not a bad area for lots of mobs
---
fast travel to your camp from the map

White Knight helps a lot with the fiber.
---
Oh please, you grand-standing, commie scum. He earned them, thus he can have as many as he wants. Just like people who work. Work? You ever work?
---
Everytime i'm on that road it chased me, and I kill it. Scared me the first time i saw it around lv 35. Not so much now. Just annoying.
---
It depends on if you want convenience, or aesthetics. I camp way out in the middle of nowhere west of Watoga, because it's beautiful and I seldom see people. For convenience I would consider camping east of Top of the World, so you are between two different vendors. Either way I camp on cliffs/next to water so that it's easier to defend
---
I'd like to be able to set up a very small base, like just a large rent with some workbenches. I love my home and I don't want to move it but fast travel is expensive. 
---
You definitely can use melee in power armor, with the exception of unnarmed. I'd recommend a super sledge. An Instigating level 45 super sledge (very cheap to buy - most people throw them away) will one shot most of the enemies that are giving you trouble with max strength and all the melee perks.

Funny gulper story from today.  I'm using up my treasure maps around the mire and see a ** legendary lvl 46 gulper hanging off a tree just north of Dyer Chemical.  I'm excited and shoot it in the head with my instigating lever rifle.  It drops to 10% health, falls off the tree and proceeds to get away from me as quickly as possible.  I take out it's buddy and start looking around for it.  I'm looking everywhere, find it hiding behind a rock abutment along the river, shoot it again, health regen kicks in, and it takes off again.  I'm looking all over, can't find it and give up.  I get the treasure hoard at Crevasse Dam and start heading NW to Mire map spot #1.  The damn gulper is standing in place on the little trail heading to Dolly Sod's wilderness.  How did it get that far from home?  At this point I have a crit banked, and I'm not interested in playing hide and seek anymore.  I swap in Better Criticals and just splatter the damn thing with another headshot.  You guessed it, nocturnal wooden leg.  All that effort for a rock (or stick in this case?)

I actually disagreed with the people in this thread, but I’ve turned around.  BGS said they where making instanced vaults, what if you could find a vault that allows you, and only you in, you go in and there your choices matter. You control the npc’s inside tell them to build or maintain or whatever, basic fallout shelter mechanics.  That could be a pretty fun mini game in the main game, much like the camp is, and it gives just so much customization options to sell to us, and because its instanced just to us it would run basically entirely client side, saving server resources and allowing you to “go crazy” in ways you never could in the camp.   
---
It would be a little sad you can’t invite friends over, but there is the whole outer world for that.  
---
Golf Course mid map. It will save you money fast traveling to be mid map. Put up near water in southern golf course. This is far enough from the nuke hits on the club house and you can then put up a lot of purifiers for water and sell any excess. 
---
I suggested a bank system. Only useable at train stations.
---
Forreal, for pvpers one of those "are you serious, it's that simple" is taking down setinel builds. A lot of things early days were just downright annoying because a lot of things seem like bugs as well but are really just game mechanics that are hard to pinpoijt

Got you boy

Platform? I don't have it, but there is a nuke zone on my server.

I played this quest last night again and couldn't tell which was the epic wolf at the end was expecting a strong boss . Disappointing but got two legendary western pistols so might have to Rp a 🤠

This has been a problem for far too long now.  I can't count how often I don't get to loot the SBQ after completing the event.  It just keeps loading.  I have yet to receive a single ultracite plan.  It's extremely frustrating.  
---
That would be cool because I’m tired of loosing caps to players when I worked hard to get my caps up
---
Pistol build, luck n gun build, or a VATs based build
---
Do you stream or know anyone who streams and shows off cool outfits and such? I feel like the only one rabidly collecting rare outfits but I know I'm not.
---
Pleasant Hills cemetery has 3 3* safes and only spawns ~5 ghouls or dogs, super easy to clear and farm and the cap stash means you can break even fast travelling there each time the safe loot re-spawns
---
Happened to me last night. Making fusion cores at monangah power plant and after about 6 cores the server shutting down msg appeared. A few months ago the server would simply disconnect without warning. Blaming dupe glitch was popular disconnect reason but it seems fo76 servers just need restarted or whatever fo76 does when the server maintainance shutdown msg pops up.
---
It makes the most sense for common stuff like you mentioned, but also for all the stuff not worth selling. It would be really helpful for inventory management to be able to make 40 sickles in one go for the xp from all the mats not worth bulking.

I sold The Dragon to a vendor today to free up space. I did the same w an AA Gatling Gun. 
---
And you could send caps between players even offline via the platform and then when they sign on they can pick a character to give the caps too
---
Sadly no

I would use lock pick to make a withdrawal.

I've got a "business" that may be able to help.  Dm me.

---
Well what I meant was that yeah foundations are immortal, but you also cant destroy bases without getting a wanted level, which if you don't have tons of caps, is pretty much a death sentence because they're crucial to the game.
---
That option appears to not exists.but the mode have contacted me and told me the steps I need to take. Thanks for the help though.
---
In those situations, assuming it's not connection as you said, a vats crit to the head normally ends it.
---
I'm not 100% sure what you're talking about but you're welcome

I’m hoping they buff ammo creation for 308 or change the ammo type for the LMG.

What's your psn id? I can help take the trash out

Pleasantly hills cemetery has 3 level 3 safes scattered around
---
Should add in multiple spawn spots all around each station and further out. Have it where you spawn in with a stealth shield for 30 sec until you fire a shot 
---
I always make all my characters look attractive. Mainly because I will inevitably put them in outfits I find in the game. 
---
I don’t think you get wanted in survival. I’ve destroyed a ton of turrets and a few walls and never had a wanted level. I’ve seen a couple people with it but assumed they came into it from adventure mode.

The President had another secret bunker closer to DC. The VP had his own as well. The Greenbriar was set up for the House and the Senate. This was done so that all of the powers that be went all be in the same place in case of a direct attack.

I didn’t think the church of atom started until Megaton or did they flow into megaton after hearing about a undetonated nuke is just sitting in the middle of town

That’s fine and all. But what would you replace as the risk in survival? There needs to be a risk of something to lose.

We should be so lucky as to have more companies as great as Ubisoft. Have you played origins or odyssey? They are amazing open world games, the best in the series aside from my personal favorite of black flag. And I've never spent a dime outside the cost of the title for any of them, because that's how things work. If you don't want to buy something, you don't have to.
---
Way to late for that.....
---
Glad you got the joke.
---
This used to happen to me all the time before the booze update.  Scorched Earth fights have all gone smooth as silk ever since (on PC).  I don't even have to stand around and wait for mob loot to populate either.  I was playing on the same server today with maybe 5-6 other pals while chatting through Discord, and we coordinated nuke launches to keep the SBQ-BBQ going 4 times in a row.  (4 times was all we could eat) I think one guy DCed during the third run, but all four were totally stable for me, which isn't saying much because I have a 100mbs connection and the station is at the corner of my block, but my pal from rural New Hampshire with a 10mbs connection didn't have any issues either.  If she can do four Scorched Earths in a row while transmitting data wirelessly through a potato pancake (literally using her phone as a hot spot), BGS has clearly done something remarkable to improve server stability.
---
I want which fluxes tho
---
the merchants at the train stations have them? I'm level 43 but alright I will look for that.
---
Yeah I was with you until your second to last paragraph. Just seems like a real slippery slope fallacy to assume we’re headed down the path towards legendary weapons being sold because of a quality of life addition. These repair kits are not pay to win and you can say they’ll lead to it but that’s really just speculation.
---
 I think the community is woke on these issues and would never allow it but like you said Bethesda needs to make more money in the long run to keep their servers running and I don’t think the cosmetics are the cash cow they thought they’d be. 
---
This post killed me, I cackled over the kernels comment. Soooo true, they put so much effort and care into these games, and people are so ungrateful, it drives me insane. 
---
Hit me up whenever in playing. Usually log on during the weekends and at night during the week
---
Diabolical Scheme which would make BSG BILLIONS:
---
Increase CAMP size and budget by a factor of 3. Duplicate FO4 Homemaker mod items and charge 50 - 250 atoms for each unique item. Each purchased item should have a couple of variant colors included (not 200 caps for just the blue sink, 200 caps for the yellow, etc.)
---
People are building little sim homes and want a billion style options. And believe me these will be the whales you are looking for. Repair kits will look like an amateur attempt at milking your player base compared to awesome CAMP decor items selling like hotcakes. 
---
I'd say do a loose build and remember to balance decent damage with some weight reduction perks
---
It's not generational. It's just growing up. There's a psychological effect being manipulated by the publishers. The idea is to remove the real money further away and to break that connection. Kind of like how credit cards are debit cards make it easier to spend money without knowing it
---
I’m joined sorry I’m late
---
You are correct, the comment you’re replying to is mega helpful but leaves out 200 caps worth. 
---
Frequently spawns even lower than that right outside Harper’s Ferry. NE on that same overpass and before the motel where that bomb disposal daily event is.

Thank you so much! I really appreciate. You’ve been a big help and I will take your advice. You seem to know a lot about this game and everything you said makes sense
---
Alright awesome man I’m sadly waiting for it to finish downloading!
---
I've been involved in killing her once.  I did a bit of damage, tried to help, and ended up with nothing to show for it.  SBQ didn't drop anything at all for me and I really have no interest in fighting her again because it took too much work for no reward.
---
Its good to have a jack of all trades character to learn the game. I did that first then yeah deleted him because my cards were all over the place and i had decided i wanted to use rifles but then realised that making that change would be difficult so i started a new character. Well a few new characters that each have specific builds.

Definitely not beyond fixing and besides soon they'll have the legendary refresh that let's you reroll the character with some sort of special bonus for post 50. Easier than rebuilding from scratch.

Once your eight year old son spends $60 on a game, I imagine he'll feel differently about paying more of his hard earned money =p

They were implied to have sprung up around the bomb in Megaton, but then again, T-51b armor was flat-out stated to be the most advanced power armor made pre-war, yet Fallout 4 introduced T-60 and retconned X-01 as a pre-war design, so this would be a minor change to the lore by comparison.

I agree man. Kids that young shouldn’t be playing this game. And no one has any right to be butt hurt about ANY pvp interaction in a workshop.

If that was their actual parent coming to defend them in-game that is some delicious irony. How about you tru to parent them in real life?
---
Get the stimpack recipe, either by buying or getting it as a reward. Then make them. 
---
You'll get to unlock Chemist around level 34. That's gonna double the amount of chems you craft. 1 stim becomes 2, for example. You'll need 2 antiseptic, 1 blood pack (you can also craft these from tick blood and antiseptic), and one steel.

Aside from looting, that's the best way I've found.

No, OP is referring to the rock formations, not the extra table resource pits.

I actually proposed the idea. But only had about an hour left, and we were planning on launching a nuke.
---
Yeah but mini nukes were way easier to find

Exactly. But the thing that gets me is he said that we were scaring them. This isn't Barbie's beach condo Adventure the video game.
---
 Healing salves for up to level 30. Easy to make. 
---
Some parents just hand kids a game without looking at the rating of the game either because they're ignorant of video game culture or they just don't care if a M rated game is going to scar the kid for life.
---
To be fair, about a third of the cans you'll run across are aluminum. Tagging aluminum helps a lot; you'd be surprised where all it turns up.
---
Meh, I get enough stuff from just playing and killing things to net 1400 a day. And there are tons of chems I’ll just straight up never use so why not sell them? You’re right that churning out hats is easier if you can get the plan, but it’s not as rewarding to me at least. 
---
Like I realize it's a joke but it still hurts to hear
---
I did something similar at first, then challenged myself to build INSIDE the hollow part. Probably one of my favorite spots and builds.
---
That's a great idea but knowing Bethesda they will probably put in the Atom Shop  
---
People get addicted to feeling offended all the time because it gives them a high; being self-righteous and morally superior feels good.

Thing is my main can do really well with the crossbow. Granted I need to stay hidden and get sneak hits but it’s good for a hush hush run. Or like I’m doing now with a true hunter build.

If it does have gravity physics then it’s at a really long range I can map bots in Watoga across the city.

Get a Instigating crossbow and some other good effects and it can be really good.

I left about 500 in plastic scrap in a suitcase at Sunnytop station other day.. As a former shotgun build,  plastic scavaging is too hard of a habit to break. If I were a low level shotgunner this would make my day finding a stash of plastic at the station.

Hey u/masopinions I’m in the EXACT same situation as you it’s uncanny... perma banned in January in first banwave due to having picked up loot bags both intentionally and unintentionally and I guess some of those “Press X to collect all” made me go over the 100k trigger cap. I too have been frustrated for months waiting on there piss poor support. My account was then labelled as temp banned and not perma banned similarly to yours, however I got an email from support (after harassing them on twitter) which was a different email from yours by the way - saying they’re actively working on a fix to “safely” return our characters to the world and will email us as soon as it’s ready. If you wanna see the email I got last week for your own peace of mind, please do get in touch👍🏼

There is no level cap.  It's just that, after Lv. 50, you don't get any further SPECIAL points and can only choose to reallocate one at a time per level.  You'll continue to select Perk Cards every level, so if anything, it would be advantageous to have a good idea of where you want your SPECIAL to be at Lv. 50, and Lv. 30 is a good time to start thinking about that.

Yeah, it makes zero sense that the Alpha pack leader isn't even a legendary. I've got a low level char and have done 2 Leader of the Packs recently and was bummed to learn the Leader wasn't a legendary. I hadn't done it on my main, and thought it was. Kinda a disappointment. 
---
If you want to engage in PvP later on I'd say look into making a better damaging dealing build for whatever weapon you prefer. If you are more PvE than just have it with your cards honestly.

I'd be willing to pay atoms for the ability to instakill the SBQ. 50 tops.

Generally on MTX;
---
It basically comes down to poor education on the matter and MTX being standardized by publishers and developers in online and singleplayer games by now.
---
Most parents won't/can't educate their kids at all when it comes down to this kind of stuff because they don't care about games or have little to no knowledge. Most of them isn't even aware of MTX and such in those games because they simply have no interest in them.
---
Now the problem is, since most parents can't/couldn't educate kids on MTX etc. and publishers/developers have been relentlessly pushing this stuff over the years; lots of kids developed this sense that it's integral part of the game(s) and that whatever the microtransaction might be it's completely normal, whether it's a simple skin or a complete P2W element.
---
If you let in a really young kid into this world of games nowadays he won't make much of it, he will want to play a game that looks cool to him and then he'll see that he (well his parents) has to pay to unlock say a save file... he'll think it's normal to buy a save file. Then he goes to another game after a while and sees even more MTX, he can't make much of it except for it costs money.
---
The younger the kids nowadays the more normal it is to them and will be over the next couple years when they grow up. Kids are being taught that MTX is a normal part of the game, even if it's in a premium singleplayer title.
---
I'm talking about kids about your sons age, a slightly bit older kids as well. It's not really some kind of magical generation gap; it's just lack of education and what they have been taught by the games they play / will play.

I've had the game since beta and I still dont know what to use the technical data for.

You can literally shoot other peoples guts into oblivion in this Franchise and someone told their kids this is a ''Funny House Building'' Game xD? Of Course i'm not allowed to question other peoples familiy education so im not going to take this as argument. Kids play weird games and most of the time underaged, pretty normal thing, everbody has done that. Still i have seen pretty weird Topics on that in this Reddit and also in the Beth forum, where dude go over protective and Anti-Socialze People with Arguments like: ''You made my childrens cry so you are a griefing Cave Troll. DOT Finite. Knockout Argument." Like every Shooter Game you buy your kid. Like every Steam Account u give your kid. Like every Connection to give your Kid, u as a parent, should have known better, thats all what i have to say bout this.

I think if you prime the MG42/MG3 the yield ratio will be closer to 50 cal which is pretty good. You just need to farm for some Fluorescent flux at WS.

Demo works on guns with explosive prefix too, but it was nerfed so you won't get crazy extra damage from it. If a rifle fires a single bullet each trigger pull you need Rifleman perks. If it fires multiple when holding the trigger it needs Commando.

Sorta. The divide has more green and brown. Not really sand covered wasteland. But hey it's a game. Right now I'm rocking the Patriot with jetpack.

That's another issue our paint scheme should cover our packs also

Build success comes down to your preference. If your trying something specific and it’s not working then its not successful. But as long as you are happy with it that’s the success. 
---
Absolutely. There’s no reason to keep it low as it is now.  Sniper users don’t use much ammo anyways so why making it harder for LMG shooters. 
---
When the game kicked us out, i went to log on immediately to check his name on the social club. To my dismay it was all empty. When i entered a server again, it loaded the recent players met, but it seemed that those were the players from that new server instead, since there were no players with the name ending with #420. That is when i regretted not adding him earlier

They should have released it October 27th this year

Yup. 3 Star mobs can drop them. Sadly 2-3 star wood armour isn’t a thing so you just bend over and take it.

I hear they are working on a fix that you can buy in the Atoms Shop soon. 
---
I don't think builds are that important. Its great speccing a character so that you can one shot god, but I think it's more fun having a well rounded character. You might realize halfway through that you love auto shotguns or pure melee, and have wasted levels. Also, one random legendary might change your entire playthrough.

I would have dropped the nuke on the camp.

I already hear too much background noise (kids being grounded, dogs barking, car sirens, etc) I don’t need a feature providing more of that.

I make my favorite bases at whitesprings golf course. But I prefer the classic home feel. Create a farm house with a garage and have it on nice grass with trees and a pleasant view. Makes me feel like I’m not in the wasteland for a moment. 
---
My base currently sits on the golf course somewhere. It has for the longest time and it will stay forever. It’s my endgame base for sure.  I’ve just added little by little over time.  It’s a great place to hang out, great defense if needed, a place people can trade, and also get supplies, water, food.

No no no no.

I agree. I'm not saying that they can't play.  Because I definitely played rated M games at an early age but I never whined.

TBH I felt like it wasn't fleshed out enough. That plot like kinda came out of left field and didn't develop enough in my opinion.
---
Sadly 2-3 star wood armour isn’t a think... I’m glad it’s not, how much worse would it be to get a Assassin sent AP Refresh on a wood piece, like getting a bloodied SS +1 str rolling pin 
---
Someone might have killed it while you were gone.
---
I don't have to "find out". You're the one making claims. You have to be the one to prove your statement, not me. 
---
16 out of 17 kills on ranged build i have received nothing. Due to loot 'disappearing'. Apparently 'fixed' but I've watched the loot disappear on an opened loot screen. I won't do sbq on ranged anymore. At least with melee if your under the body you can spam take all and get a portion. Still manage to miss out on all legendaries
---
Well said 
---
I like her, but no Bobs in the Description. 9/10 :(
---
If you're spawning in water at your CAMP,  move the CAMP unit within the build area using the edit function - this will change where you spawn in relation to it, allowing you to more or less choose where you spawn at. 
---
Better than when I spawn on the side of a sheer cliff, halfway down.
---
Yep, and to elaborate, the receivers make a difference in the above determination.
---
I saw my first crab when I went to the mire doing freedom states quests maybe 7 - 10 hours of play
---
I didn't realize this either. I hadn't finished on my ranged but had on melee and thought it was a glitch. Well that's more inspiration to get it done on the 'glass cannon'
---
I think something changed. I always spawned in at exactly the same spot. Now it’s pretty random, sometimes on one side of camp. Sometimes the other....
---
But half the time I can place my camp? In fact this one time my camp was placed, I was on a team, got disconnected, reconnected to my team and my camp couldn’t be placed even though it was the same server— and no one loaded in the time I wasn’t connected 
---
Damm didn't know about these.. gonna have to check now

What good does it do to stop playing THIS game, and continue supporting the rest of their games?    That makes little sense.      
---
That will have zero impact on their behavior, and ultimately supports it - they're still getting your money, after all.
---
Nice! Welcome to crazy-town. I'm basically playing the role of someone like Trevor from GTA 5.
---
Embrace Atom' s glow
---
I did keep up.  Has nothing to do with things about the game, only to do with how people play it.  Nice try tho.  Still off topic, still wrong.
---
What’s your PSN, I’ve got a TSE minigun and I’m spec’d for damage. Also have the Empathy mutation
---
Well you see when girl and a boy love each other alot. 
---
Thanks! I heard about it from a buddy in my discord channel earlier today! Did you hear whereabouts in Top of the World it spawned?
---
I get an error when I click the link, did you delete it, or is my internet being screwy?
---
Upvote for making me chuckle. Yeah my character was wearing a matching outfit to me :)
---
This
---
So cool
---
I know someone who did his base entirely inside that column. Multiple floors using rugs and everything. He put some crafting station to clip thru the circle into the base 
---
CLOTH?  Aside from steel and wood, it's probably the most common component in the game.  If you are having trouble finding it, mark it as desired in your pip-boy junk section.  If you have done this, and are still not finding cloth, me telling you where to find shitloads of it isn't going to help, because the answer is pretty much anywhere except facilities exclusively guarded by robots.
---
I've actually never played the game. Nor bought it. I just like Bethesda enough to criticize. 
---
Why does every quest with a guaranteed must have 2-3* legendaries? Can't some quests just be of a lower power level? 
---
I didn't delete and I double checked to see if I made it hidden or something on accident but no
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/GfnsJ0u is the link the imgur app gives me.
---
The server costs aren't that large, and controlling the servers is so powerful in reducing software piracy that it more than pays for itself in the short run. The question is how long a company is obligated to run said servers when all the payment is upfront. 
---
I get so many random 3 star weapons that make me roll my eyes every time I inspect them after looting. 
---
Fudge. Must be my internet. This isn't the only one I've gotten a weird error on lately, now that I think about it. Hmm.
---
Yo, shoulda reported them, and followed up on the email that they were underage and breaking ToS on that account.
---
This is AMAZING.
---
Nope only one animal at a time

Can someone who isn't unemployed give OP gold? This is frikking AWESOME!

Are you on mobile or desktop?
---
it could be your browser. Or what ever it's trying to open in.
---
That would defeat every purpose of having caps in your inventory completely and is a bit illogical. Why would you go farm caps somewhere just for the purpose to hord em in your secret lair, where absolutely noone has access to it. With your idea should'nt they just go directly into that extrem super safe bunker? Exactly how Atom Points work.
---
Healing salves are good and easy. 
---
Just need blood leaf and soot flower. You can find a bunch by the Little Creek by the bridge near the overseer camp.
---
If not, get the Pharma farm perk

Is that a bug or intended since only 1 card of iron fist?
---
40 missiles destroyed your house? You built it out of toilet paper,? Get some cardboard walls and you'll never worry about missiles again!
---
On a serious note, you got griefed but you got friends here. What platform you on and anything you need in particular? If it's PC I got a ton of mats no problem. This will be a bad memory when the next patch makes homes invincible.
---
I got you. Cover the mats, no xtra charge. 
---
I actually love that this game draws in players of every age group.  I play with an older lady. Sounds like granny Smith looks. She bad was with her tse shot gun. I also have some kids I help on occasion.  Idk their age, but I can tell by their voice puberty has not kicked in. All do what's necessary to survive in the wasteland. 
---
Dont own workshops then
---
Wow, as a fellow fo4 hoarder, i dip my hat to you. That being said, don't get a head of yourself in regards to what or how many things can be shown before a server crash. From what I've read about up coming displays is they are allowing certain things to be displayed via display 'cabinet' eg a bobble head display cabinet. Im very much hoping this isn't the case and we can display anything but i think it will be tied to the stash system like the fermenter. 
---
So I found a live dog that was level one but I don't have any taming skills so it just kind of walked around and was cool. Location: fast travel to Harpers Ferry. Make a right and go under the bridges and find some stairs that keep going up and up &amp; @ veeeerrrryyyy top i found dog w/2 skeletons &amp; campfire pit
---

This.  Take the workshop, they show up during the defend event.
---
Thank you all for the comments/feedback. I appreciate it. I love a good discussion with differing opinions and viewpoints . I never imagined how many people would comment on the subject. I wish my market posts received so much attention. LOL
---
Every legendary, mutation and perkcard  thematic that has todo with ''Hunter'', ''Stealth'' and "Food processing"
---
Your Stats should be around a Perception(Enemy Detection), Endurance(Longlivablilty and Survival) and Agility Build(Sneaking).

Bless you.

More damage the less armor basically. 
---
So pretty OP rifle.
---
Division is upon us!
---
Np
---
I laughed so hard at the last part
---
Treat it like junk 
---
You don’t happen to have a pink asylum outfit? It was supposed to be a gift for a friend, we’ve been farming Defiance for weeks for it. 
---
Why are you blaming the kids for the adult's issue? Seems like that lvl 200 wasn't just some random. Maybe a parent?
---
Why not deal with the adult in game or report rather than come whinge here? 
---
They also heal you instantly and are a nice item to vendor if you have an excess number of them. 
---
so you'd rather remain ignorant if someone doesn't hand-feed you information. can you not think for yourself at all?
---
I’ve heard the suggestion to make Grahm the radio host, and have him give hints about to his current location.
---
Pvp exploit enabler except not just people with mules can do it. Now anyone can. 
---
Oh, good call. Works on mobile. 
---
It's not leather but just found deep pocketed Robot armor and Marine armor plans today
---
That's my biggest complaint. They fuck us over. Iso badly want to use a Mg42 ( an mg3 would be better) but the damage output is shit and crafting bullets for anything not .50 is also a major joke.
---
Cry for help for a shitty life. I just can't see a well adjusted person doing so just because. 
---
The pic is of my WIP that I'm trying to make look a little more 'real' and none floaty
---
Or claimed like the workshops...
---
Blew my mind first time I ran across one of these.  Really cool.
---
If you've seen then, report them. 
---
Alright guys it's time!! Join up and load in. 
---
Buddy and I call it the dead drop.  Always check the suitcases. We have joined the habit of leaving plans, ammo,  etc. 
---
O that sucks. Good luck
---
You need to learn to fucking read.  The kids had a camp NEAR the Sunshine factory, not in it.  I know that area well, and I bet dollars to donuts they had built right at that river edge off the bed in the road before the factory.  It's a common spot for newbies.   And if you're such an internet tough guy, maybe you should out yourself with your name and address here?  Nothing?  I thought not...
---
I mean I did.  I told him that I wasn't doing anything to them or their camp for them to be "scared" and that it was ridiculous. 
---
From the Top of the World FT location (the survey market, run straight ahead. You’ll pass the tables with mod/gun on the left, and the lodge with the raider vendor on your left. There is a workbench to the left that has a mod but keep going. There is a workbench to the right that has a ski lift pod behind it. At the bench, right next to it, can spawn a blue plan. That’ll be it. I saw about 5 different things before the BoS Legs, over about 10ish hops. A red plan can spawn to the right in the case. I was able to get the blue plan, and a few hops later get a red one, but I wouldn’t risk it if you aren’t sure
---
After that, turn to your left, and run down the street towards he fire traps. A little ways down is a place you can turn left into with a workbench. With bench on the right, there is another blue plan spawn there that had pocketed combat chest for me. Idk if both could spawn the BoS but you’d have 2 shots
---
Ah wow, nice! Thank you! I'll grab those up!
---
Ya. I am sure there are a lot of people who can understand how all the game mechanics will work and what their expected damage output should be for a given weapon... But as I said, I am terrible at that kind of thing so an on-screen number that tells me what damage I'm doing would help me make better choices on what weapons with what legendary effects with what chems with what foot/drink buffs to use.
---
I mean, the number must actually exist in order to calculate how much health the target should lose...it's just whether that number is even accessible to the client.  One would imagine it would be? 
---
I've got at least 3 of them from tech data. I'm similar to that other guy too, 500+ hrs playing since launch, not a single paint yet, nor a single science scribe outfit. I mostly get ammo and a stimpack, and I noticed you didn't include ammo as a category of loot?
---
You know your beard prevents a solid seal on that mask, right?
---
Blood for the Blood God ;)
---
That you Gus Chiggins?
---
I'm only for it if it's local only. Seen the game-wide implementation &amp; it was just an in-game discord server.
---
People say they want text chat as an alternative to voice chat between characters but the text chat mod on PC only proved people rarely used it for that purpose. Mostly trade hawking &amp; general chatter. 
---
Everybody's dead
---
It’s a drop off a random spawn.  
---
Well, the prevailing idea is that it allows the lifetime of the game to be controlled, rather than to control piracy. And a player-hosted version would reduce the desire to purchase premium items. It's a win-win for whoever collects the money.
---
I just wonder why Fallout + co-op didn't happen. In my ideal world of perfection, that would have player-hosted servers and complete modding freedom. And if it was Fallout 4 + co-op DLC, BGS could reuse every asset guilt-free.
---
THIS.
---
I'd like some Free State stuff in general.
---
Build a simple 2 block foundation camp that you can squeeze all of your crafting tables into, 4 walls, a roof. There are challenges: social- building workshops and camps. So build and move locations often. Anything that you think you don't need to do, You will need to do.
---
Awesome!! Thanks for typing all of that out! I'm going to go pick up some beer and buckle myself in for a long night of farming!
---
You know, you may be right about Watoga now that I think about it... 
---
In that case, I revise my suggested vendor-hop path to account for that:
---
Harpers -&gt; Pleasant Valley -&gt; Sutton Station (Responders) -&gt; Whitespring Station -&gt; Watoga Station -&gt; Watoga Shopping Plaza (BoS)
---
Thanks for the clarification there :)
---
There's also the other unique traveling Vendor Bot (I think it's an Eyebot) that can spawn at Charleston Station, but that one is difficult and typically requires server hopping. 
---
I want a group finder mechanic for dungeons and nuke silos.
---
Well it has two holes when I shoot it not in Power armor and one when in power armor
---
From memory with future DLC that's coming. A huge Faction revamps going to happen.. Apparently. Or something of that nature.
---
But both my friend and I are living in multi story 1x1 staircase cubes and I like it. 
---
It has been that way since launch. Know that doesn't answer your question. I've always just thought it was an oversight.
---
...what? If anything, your post is more of a “tough guy” vibe dude.
---
OP did nothing wrong. He didn’t attack their camp. Worst thing he maybe did was grab from an unlocked resource? 
---
You want me to out myself for saying kids shouldn’t be playing and parents should enforce it? Ok man but I don’t know if the public is ready for my bold opinion. 
---
No no no!!! We want beverage crafting and repair kits!! 
---
The link doesn't work on my desktop Chrome browser either.
---
Imgur has been weird like that lately.
---
I thought you were talking about Sentinel armor for a moment.
---
Abominations of all that is natural I tell ya!😉
---
How very strange, lemme see if I grab the link on a desktop it might be different.
---
I laugh in the face of physics. 
---
Sending you an up vote cause I laughed a little. Feels like some posts are just expecting to much from the game or want too much handed to them and I think you captured that well.
---
That's good. Thanks for telling me.
---
And it'll laugh in yours when Newton comes for you two!!
---
Bingo. It may not *technically* be an MMO, but damn. It desperately needs all of these basic features.
---
If he can get past the turrets he can bring it down. 
---
I really like that as well, but I don’t know how you would stop someone taking the vault and destroying  everything :(   With a workshop it sucks, but a persistent vault with people in it, that becomes a crime! 
---
That's what I'm hoping for aswell because if they ever add a system like in 4 where PA can be displayed but still count as an entity, I can see it being a big problem
---
Ya maybe, dosen't seem right to me 😕
---
That’s where I was confused. That’s good news because it will cover both of those weapons. 
---
He meant non repair kit post if that makes more sense.
---
Its just my opinion, but if your kid cant handle a game they shouldnt be playing it. I wouldnt let my kid play an M rated game without making sure they can at least deal with it, if they are gonna get scared of it they are too young, if they are going to mimic it they are too young.
---
Parents need to monitor what their kids are playing and make smart choices about it.
---
I can't walk through a camp I've built and see an over hang or platform without adding metal struts if it looks like that bit wouldn't hold itself up in real life.
---
It makes camps look janky and out of place.
---
when i clicked on the link from my desktop I got a Zoinks! So I grabbed the link from desktop I think the link is the same but I tried from the desktop and no zoinks this time [https://imgur.com/gallery/GfnsJ0u](https://imgur.com/gallery/GfnsJ0u)

---

---
Easy way or the hard way?
---
Are you sure it’s only Animal Friend 3 as the requirement? 
---
I’ve heard you need charisma 6 at least. 
---
Oh don't you know? Nothing can stop newton. For every action against him there is an equal and opposite reaction.
---
So be real careful else he Uses his F=ma to knock y'all down.
---
Yeah a YouTuber who does camp builds whose name escapes me atm built there and mentioned that if you didn't have marsupial you had to fast travel out, which was a turn off for me for a camp location.
---
I'm hoping they do full displays for any item if the right display is built, but the displayed items stay in stash so that they dont count as an item in the world. That way if they add armor mannequins or PA displays then they won't count as entity's and cause server lag
---
Yep; all you need is to swap out receivers based on Auto or Semi-Auto.
---
I got an auto AAE handmade and was able to keep my Rifleman build by putting on a semi-auto receiver, for example.
---
Yea I have no reason why you're getting downvoted. Because you're right. 
---
There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge
---
They are abhorrent monstrosity that laugh at science.
---
Move it back..u always spawn in 15 feet in front of the camp thingy 
---
Every game has a roadmap no? The timeline might have changed give or take a few weeks/months but it has to be part of plan from day 1. 
---
Lmao.
---
What is semi auto considered? This always confused me
---
I go fissure farming now for plans. Great xp, good swarms and 1-3 per beasts per travel. Duplicate plans even sell for 750-3k
---
I wonder if they only appear when they're a certain level because I went from seeing none to a bunch after almost 100 hours of play. Since I'm a higher level now the ghouls are higher level and drop better loot?
---
Treasure maps. A couple of folks have claimed to find them in containers in world, too. 
---
Lol yeah I seen what tour saying! Lol I have a feeling they have a lot of things planned and intend to add them over the next year!
---
Any way honestly can I hear both?
---
Alright thank you
---
Semi-auto refers to the ability to pull the trigger as fast as you can.
---
It's a good.move for sure. I had a lot of hops at the asylum when I was looking for worker uniforms so I took advantage of my time there.
---
Ok so it's under auto is what I wanted to verify
---
Not really a bug, but yeah.
---
How much do you want?
---
I agree
---
They supposedly spawn in the raider camp near the arena by top of the world at the armour bench or wait till someone offers them for sale from 3.5k-5k each
---
But he'd have to get in motion in the first place because I hear he is doing a lot of resting at the moment
---
If I’m not mistaken or misinformed. Isn’t wood armour of the more stealth based armours? Not everything needs to top tier and op. 
---
And a bloodied rolling would be very appealing to someone roleplaying as a chef. 
---
I see, thank you lots. Have they been going up for sale often?
---
Safety first. 
---
Nooooooo; Semi-Auto is the technical term for single-shot, hair trigger guns. Think bolt-action, if you could fire as fast as you pulled the trigger.
---
Fully automatic means you don’t have to let go, to continue firing.
---
Fair enough.
---
I’ve seen a few offers over the last couple days, if you’re needing some bos upgrades I could help you out on Xbox if you want
---
I think having a choice to local or regional would be cool! I don't have a mic and get sick of site hopping for trades and groups! Is everyone that plays on the same discord? How many are there?
---
Maybe they plan on adding something to it for a quest in a future update
---
I appreciate the offer, but I’m not really in need of that now...just want the ability to do it. Thanks again👍🏻
---
So then it would have to be like pledging alliance to one of multiple vaults and doing missions for them.
---
I cant even be bothered to farm them anymore. Last bunch of times we've been on dead maps, we farmed mats for a bit and nobody doing anything at all. Drop on whitesprings and everyone and their uncle runs down to one hit everything. I call them the Freeloaders and it pisses me off.
---
You you better believe he hears about these floating houses he will be in motion faster than you can say "the vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration a of the object: F = ma"
---
And you know once he is in motion he will continue to move at a constant velocity!
---
I think they like to monitor trades and the "community's" response to things on reddit and discord! It would be a lot harder to do in game chat! 
---
You're more then welcome mate.
---
Do u have the plan
---
Find cap stashes using the perception Fortune Finder perk (or just ask other players). The caps in them respawn every 24 hours (I believe). Visit them all every day to get more caps. Also use the luck perk that lets you find more caps in them.
---
There's also some locations in the world where you can always find caps, not in cap stashes. The Freak Show location has dozens of single caps sitting in buckets, along with a caps stash.
---
There's also a container in the forest near Flatwoods that respawns about 20 caps in it every day. It's not a caps stash, just a hidden footlocker in a tree stump. If you find the dead body in the fridge, his holotape tells you how to find this hidden footlocker.
---
There's also some enemies you can farm that drop caps. The super mutant behemoth respawns in the same location every 30-60 minutes or so and always drops around 15 caps. However, at lv30 you probably can't kill it.
---
Also beyond your level, but good to know: fissure site prime usually has some mega sloth bodies around it. These bodies always have about 15-20 caps on them. You can loot them every time a new body is there, which I believe is every 24 hours.
---
I don’t feel fertile soil deserves one.
---
The biggest problem is barely any of them are max item level worthy.
---
AWOL armaments is my favorite. Always level 50 sometimes three star
---
Probably get real good at pvp and play survival I probably made 60k caps sense it came out and that's on the low end
---
My finger is off the trigger I swear!
---
Seems fair considering the event has 3 different legendaries. The final wolf is a separate event so you get more rewards for killing 1 more wolf. 
---
Ghouls always drop chems..a good spot is inside Charleston capital building..server hop til u get ghouls..repeat
---
I'm hoping its provides some new gear, enemies, and interesting lore.
---
I think they are always good..for limb damage for example 
---
Asshole
---
Because if I destroy your base you have to get recourse to repair it. So instead of getting better weapons to kill me with your repairing your stuff
---
Found same! What a journey up there that was!
---
I grew up and hour north of Morgantown in PA. Grafton is not north of it as it is on the map and, given the game scale, the crashed space station should be Uniontown-ish I think.
---
The mixed-up map does my head in!
---
Well like you originally said, a bit of fallout shelter, so we would do some questline that gets the people of the vault to trust and eventually enact you as overseer.  As overseer you would direct the people to make different rooms to generate different resources to live.   You could then go out and collect resources for the vault, like in FS and just leave them be, or micromanage as much as you want.   Each vault would be instanced to a single player so even if you and I both did the original mission and enter the vault at the same time, I would get my vault, you yours.  
---
So regardless if 10 different people all went in the same vault, they would each get a separate instance of their own to fulfill? Brillaint!
---
Without a more focused build you are robbing yourself of doing more damage. I found a good balance of high damage with good quality of life perks. My melee does 1600 damage, rifles do 700 damage, and plenty of QOL benefits that make it fun all around. Without good damage the game is a little rough. You burn through more ammo, repair items more often, and have to farm junk more often rather than just looting along the way enough to maintain your stuff. 
---
Weapon artisan fixes them to 200%

Bethesda Clare’s about your well being. 
---
If you're on ps4, you might get lucky with the Recently Played With (or whatever it's called) at the bottom of the main Friends menu.
---
Because if enough people do, they'll be forced to either change or shutter THIS game.
---
I've been farming alot of low lvl 3* gear lately. They sell great
---
There are some arms up for sale right now king farts is
---
I can see that but that new event is also a horde event and horde events ALWAYS have a legendary lol 
---
Voice chat one on one OR area ie ESO would be cool if it were used for intended purpose of enriching game play but unfortunately I'd give it a day before it turned into an audio cess pool of @ssholes yelling dumb shit like someone repeatedly chanting something like MOO!!! MOOO!!!MOOOO!!!!:ie any hub city/town on ESO
---
No, but you can install a nexus mod that makes them glow and thus makes them easier to find.
---
Not on Xbox myself, but did you try uninstalling and reinstalling? Or even something as simple as changing your character's looks? It's a Bethesda game, so literally anything could be affecting anything, I feel like.  Different equipment/clothes, too much of one or two items.  Who knows?
---
You couldn’t teach me anything no matter how hard you try. And btw I identify as a longhorn cow fish, not a pigeon. Look it up

---
Southeast of Whitesprings is a location called The Vantage. Fast travel to this location then walk southeast from there. You will find a pond directly west of the Twin Lakes location. This pond has a guaranteed lv50 behemoth that respawns in it regularly.
---
What they need to do is give Erik Dellums another persona, say "Lone Dog" and then retcon the Fallout lore to insinuate that Three Dog took his name from an old radio DJ that made it though the great war and kept up the good fight 20 years later near the southern, east coast mountains.
---
This happened om the PC version
---
Funny 
---
Ask on the market subs
---
Exactly, you lose a chunk of the multiplayer, but you then gain that everything is local to the client, so you can do things you could never allow in the multiplayer game.  You could even go so far as “resources only go in, not out” and you wouldn’t even really have to worry about duper’s, as it would just effect their instance and experience.  You do need to figure out something else that the vault time gives you as a benefit though to replace it being a resource source.  
---

Good luck.

My guns break all the time. Generally I find that I either don’t have any ammo or the guns are three shots away from broken. 
---
I still won’t buy repair kits but I dispute the idea that guns aren’t breaking. 
---
I agree,  and yes I did uninstall it,  I created another character and haven't had an issue with it.  It seems to  some what related to my power armour  I think.  But I'll try to change my look tho,  thanks for the  response, I appreciate it.

Side note. Erik Dellums has gone to Comic-cons, dressed as Three Dog, and walked around in character looking for Fallout cosplayers. He'd take the job in a heartbeat.

That and all the entire set of rules to promote griefing and protect griefers. The multiplayer aspect of the game is truly toxic. They are singing ‘rebuild’ but really want people to murder and rob each other instead. Luckily majority of the players are awesome people and they had to remove slap-kill of pacifists. 
---
check pm bro
---
I hope you enjoyed your lil' trip around our state (assuming you're not from here)!
---
YEEEEEEEEES!!! Bring him back, PLEASE!
---
What the heck are u threatening him I'm pretty sure that against some sort of rule of Reddit.
---
I’m just wondering but have you ever seen someone where it on console?
---
What’s the 6 endurance points for?
---
They can't even fix the one they have in FO4 with creation club. Adding something like this to an online lobby would destroy it.
---
This is confusing me because, at least for me, this event always starts close to the vault in the forest. Not sure why that requires a three star legendary anything.
---
From what I've read over the past 36 hours, people dont want Atoms affecting game play. So I hope not.
---
10. Safes.. Why is it that if a safe has already been picked clean by another player,  do I have to go through the work (and about three Bobby pins) of picking the safe only to find the safe is empty.
---
It Really makes me not want to bother lock picking. There's no reward for it. 
---
lol things that need to be fixed or changed is not something that should be tied to political views. like rights for people is not a view its a fact.
---
Buy the previous three before you complete the questline for Rose and Rose will give it to you as a reward drop.
---
&gt; poor decisions based on profit rather than popularity
---
The game has no monthly fee; it is free to play forever after you buy it for, at this point, ridiculous prices.  Companies are in the business of making money.  In the case of this game, the MORE popular it is, the less money they make, **unless people buy things off the Atom shop.**
---
If people want love, they should get a hug from mom or dad.  Video games are an economic transaction, not a love letter.  We live in a consumerist society where people expect companies to love them.  This is ridiculous.
---
All i can say is I play for hours in end and onky repair my guns every other day or so. If you are having a different experience it must be a difference in play time, play style, or maybe build.  Point is you can play without needing a repair kit easy.
---
I would pay many atoms for this
---
They could have like a gang-run super mutant radio. Mad Dog Malone is in fo76 and they could have him be like that. 
---
Yeah. I hate seeing posts where everyone wants something different. Most are really cool ideas, like backpacks and such. But just completely out of the scope of what the game needs. Some don’t even match the gameplay style of the game. It’s just ridiculous by this point. The mods probably need to do something about it
---
Hang tough dweller 
---
This made me cringe at least three times. What a disturbing perspective this human has. 
---
Yeah I posted a question and was literally told "be happy it didn't reset all the way" like I should thank Bethesda their product didn't ENTIRELY fuck up, yeah okay
---
GOOD JOB ON TODD MENTIONING YOUR CREATIVE EXPRESSION!! WE KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.
---
Haha nice 
---
Haven't really encountered this issue. Are you using the perk that reduces it's breaking?
---
Something about those motherfucking GOLF SHOES! 
---
I think it's kinda funny that all these pre-war robot changes and no one thought "hey, it'ed be hilarious to have a non-human DJ who told absolutely horrible one liners and did jingles for various shops and services around the wasteland". 
---
I did not. Sorry, edited the main post and then lost my internet for about two hours. 
---
I am. At first I thought it was bugged for me and the game didnt register the card. But whenever I use the rifles they break faster than they used to. While the heavy weapons e.i. my 50. Cal out last them in durability
---
The thing is, i was stuck in a work bench loop, and the only part of the game that was "working as normal" was my push to talk button.  No updates, no health, no...nothing. 
---
I would love this!
---
It was there at the end of my log out time out/game crash when I re-logged. 
---
I HAVE had this bug eat shit before, though. 
---
umm most of us paid 60 dollars for the game... they made a ton of sales many millions the fuck.
---
.....but they have access to the know-how of ZeniMax. What excuse do they really have?
---
I eddited the post, but yeah, somewhere between the game fucking up on me and my time out/game crash it auto saved. 
---
I've seen some of these sites through my years of traveling through West Virginia, mostly around Harper's ferry and Charleston. The wife and I plan to stay at the Greenbriar and tour the bunker in June or so I'm really stoked about it. 
---
It appears not or the likely hood is insanely small. I've crafted quite a few just to scrap/learn and like I said I've also been scrapping ever piece I've found since this character was new. I haven't learned a new mod in a long time but I'm still missing DP, shadowed and maybe others. 
---
My profile
---
I seem to spot those a lot, of course. 
---
I kind of see what you are saying, and you know your kid better than I do, but children don't quite understand the concept of a budget and the value of money.  When I was 8, I'd want to buy everything I saw because I didn't get money, I thought $100 was a freaking crap ton of money, and I literally thought my family was rich because I got a $100 bill for my birthday when I was like 7.  
---
I love posts like yours. "Someone's angry at a shitty bug, they just want karma". No, I've had this bug multiple times, it HAS eaten recently acquired shit before. One of my first semi-decent legendary drops disappeared on me this way. 
---
Should I have waited until I was calmer to actually post on Reddit about it? Yeah, no doubt. was it Karma bate? Fuck that shit. 
---
If u kno where Yao guai spawn they drop deep pocketed and pocketed

Looks like it's a protectron. I've personally never seen it though.
---
Take your time. There's so much to do before you finish the main quest line. After that, you're finding things to do to keep playing. 
---
Yeah
---
Sorry forgot to mention

Gt u1smoothOpr8r 
---
I can sell you some cheap tomorrow
---
Seriously. Wtf
---
Do you seriously think there's a room full of servers at Bethesda hq or something? Bethesda neither owns nor operates "their" fucking servers, they're rented cloud servers from Amazon. 
---
I was expecting it but sadly it wasn't implemented. Hopefully it will be.
---
I got legs from Top of the World today. It’s true
---
Clarify this please. What is SBQ loot?
---
What’s your gt I’ll sell you some
---
Handmades depend on the reciever, as to whether they use the commando, or rifleman perks. Any reciever that says "atomatic" will benefit from the commando perks. Any semi-auto (hardened receiver, etc.), draw from the rifleman, and are shared between handmades, levers, hunting, etc..
---
Sorry, no. Don't have any of the outfits but the dirty and weathered but I have a few hats
---
I think it would be kind of cool if the radio host would announce anyone who got a bounty, and for what. They could say "username" is wanted for unlawful murder, or for demolition of property, etc.
---
A werewolf type of subcreature would be noice.
---
I hate running into kids while playing the game. When I encounter other players, I expect and hope to hear people who are at least 17, not some freakin squeakers. I immediately get pissed and annoyed when I hear a young child in game, like what the fuck??? How dumb are these parents letting their young kids play an online game like this??
---
Dang I’ll grind that I guess. Where exactly is this raider camp??
---
I wish horde event had an actual horde and not a herd.
---
Hey are you on now we are low on people 
---
So, Why does it look so much like The White House?
---
I want more tato variants.
---
I mean...,play how you like but those kids have just as much a right to play as you regardless of their behavior so long as they dont break the ToS.
---
Sorry, the wife wanted to watch the latest season if a show
---
Is this a trap?
---
I hope they make it worth while. If it takes at minutes to get through or the loot sucks ass I'll be disappointed. Hopefully it adds cool lore as well
---
If there will be a host, I think it should be a Protectron. Imagine in between each song hearing that beautiful voice saying, "PrOtEcTROn oN dUty" and reading out a mix of things the player accomplished (Including the main story, and a few important side quests like "Mayor for a day"), server wide events (nuke drops and Scorchbeast queen kills) and even some other things. Like everything in Appalachia, the radio show should be automated. 
---
Some examples of things that I think would be great to hear:
---
"Holy sh\*t, the world has ended for the millionth time. Grab your wife, your kids, and run to the vault before it's too late."
---
"A really big bird has been seen flying around Watoga... again. If you want to hunt it down, **good luck**."
---
"It's that time of the day where I read fan mail. 'Dear Potectron, go short circuit in the nearest pit and replace your self with a real person you worthless hunk of scrap.' As much as I would love to do so, the last person I saw had crystals growing on his head.  Safe to say, I'll be hear a while."
---
I just started.dumping everything. I get 99 crap legendaries for every 1 remotely worth keeping. No one has *that much* stash space.
---
I justvload up a few days before it go's live. No semse in stashing so much with 6 weeks still to go
---
No sir. Well at least I don’t think so. Just met this dude but did one round and he’s pretty chill
---
Ok. Im joining. Is it fists only? Armor allowed? What are the rules? 
---
Hi joining, I'm dad!
---
Ugh, hate when that shit happens. Or when you go to open the workbench, nothing happens, you go off to do other things...and suddenly, when you're surrounded by ghouls, BAM! Armor workbench menu. Haaaaate it so much, also hate being stuck in the workbench. Glad all your stuff is still there!!
---
This is what I was wondering. Good to know! Will look forward to testing it myself ;-) 
---
He will explain in party
---
Ok. Im queued up to join
---
It definitely is. The eyebot that sometimes spawns isnt a vendor.
---
What’s your gt? I’ll invite to party
---
Jesus.
---
Max pharma farma takes 3 skill points, and max starched genes takes 2. So you’d need 5 luck, not 4. But that’s fine, because you can easily drop intelligence by 3 and just swap first aid for weapon artisan when you’re in camp.
---
Awesome. Wish I had the creativity myself to have a backstory for my character. 
---
That shit is annoying
---
There's a keypad next to it. The code is in the enclave military wing in the inbox of the computer you register on. 478250 I think. Anyhow I found the enclave under armour shielded plan in there, but that was it.
---
Thought I was going crazy with how quickly my lever action rifle kept breaking recently.
---
Todd Howard - best buy yourself a few repair kits, only 5000 atoms
---
Camp damage hasnt been patched out of the game yet. Im going to guess you were running pascafist mode and thats why you coudln't hurt it. 
---
You're not alone that's how I noticed when I was clearing out the big bend tunnels
---
What's yours
---
I realize this is all personal preference and opinion, but I like the fact that this isn't an option.  As soon as people get damage numbers visible, they tend to fixate on that and a non-trivial portion of the player base gets elitist about it.  I personally really like figuring out what's good enough and what's not based on actual firsthand use, and not feel like I "have to" use a certain option over another because the damage numbers are better.  I realize that's all in my head, but for me it's a small source of stress that they've eliminated.
---
Todd Howard - underwater breathers are now available in the shop for 1000 atoms
---
FreckledWoogie I’m in your team
---
I dunno, I'm over 500 hours and I've seen quite a few. I feel like I've seen them the whole time, though. 
---
Lol didn't know that was you
---
Bethesda.net go to fallout 76

No worries hahah

Where did I say anything about love or any kind of emotional response..? You went off tangent a bit th
---
I would've came to you a lot sooner
---
Ash heap, a little ways south east of of the burning mine is where I have my camp setup with an extractor. 
---
Yeah that's a stupid statement. They've already stated they're making the camps of pacifists immune to damage.
---
+karma
---
What’s wrong with Charleston station?
---
My tactic is.. Find a few or buy them.. Use the portable water filters.. Use super duper and make diluted ones. Fastest way for me along with the perk that increases stim pack healing
---
Lone dog for President!
---
I feel like they are trying to market the kits that way.  I noticed this a few days after the survival update
---
What do you all think they should do about doubles for perk cards? The moment they allow a trade is the moment i quit. Lol joking.
---
Now that you can gift crown store items you can buy almost anything from the crown shop from other players with gold. The only thing you can't gift are houses I think.
---
Actually it isnt. The health number of enemies isnt even accessible to the client just a percentage that the bar uses. I had tried to make one using the data the is stored deep in some ba2 files to make a health percentage to real number mod but i could never get it to work.
---
I wish I was cool enough to pick on kids...
---
Thanks for understanding 
---
Animated drinking and eating. Its been done with mods before and very well at that so id love to see it
---
A juke box/radio station you can stream your own music through
---
this is just not true. you can spawn anywhere on the outer edge of where your camp is
---
If you go to your audio options you'll see you have three options: auto, area, team,
---
Auto is selected by default and will change your voice chat depending if you're on a team or not
---
If you're not in a team the chat will set to area and everyone can hear you in a certain radius around you
---
If you're in a team it will set to team and only your teammates can hear you regardless of where you are
---
As you can imagine if you select either team or area that will be the default voice chat you'll talk to regardless if you're in a team or not depending on your choice 
---
It doesn't have anything to do with age. It's what the person knows what is normal or greed. Young kids only play super monetized games because companies can take advantage of that
---
To this day, I don't even know wtf T-60 motion assist servos do. 
---
You give caps weight and force players to drop 100% of the caps their currently carrying when they die. 
---
Put them in the brown bag so they can get them back if not taken.
---
Any workshop too.  Easy aliminum.
---
3 lvl 50 mythical flatwoods monster ha ha ha
---
Scorched beast queen loot
---
I'd love to be able to check the pip-boy, and it'd be REALLY awesome if there were some eating, drinking, smoking, etc animations. 
---
Nobody seems to specifying. 
---
Survival straight up killing nets you 2x other player's level in caps + all said player's junk and a portion of aid. Bounties just posted caps + same junk and aid. 
---
Adventure has pvp limitations, shooting a player is an invitation to pvp but it doesn't start until the other returns fire. Additionally a player is open to pvp if they have a bounty or you contest their workshop. Caps are tied to bounty or 1x level, also defeated player drops all junk but no aid. 
---
I would pay ATOMS for these animations, too. I'd rather have cool animations while sitting than taking pictures. 
---
I had to do a lucky one, just a crit. Wasted two beers before I realized it just wasn't working. I server hopped and then it registered finally.
---
Yeah I totally get that. Like I have got to.level 110ish without it so it's not like a feature I must have. I just have sometimes thought that it would have been nice to know.
---
I often feel that my weapons are dealing different amounts of damage even when I have used the same weapon and items and am against the same enemies. 
---
Looks like someone didnt get to go to Wavy Willard's Water Park.
---
Ahhh ok. Thanks for letting us know. Guess thats the nail in the coffin for that idea 😁
---
Thanks again.
---
When you're heart aches I always find it easy to sing country roads.
---
Was on a sleepy standard server where I'd been just mass crafting ammo in peace with some workshops when some dude comes out of nowhere and kills me while I'm at the chemistry bench. Took EVERYTHING I'd just smelted (hours of stockpiling that was only in my inventory and out of my stash for the moments it took to craft) and teleported away before I could even respawn.
---
Saw him at his CAMP in the Mire. Plugged my mic in and hopped over. Came across him in an absolute shit excuse for a base repairing like FIVE suits of power armor with all of my shit. I told him how I'd been working on that pile for ages (he needed his excavator just to get home). He came out of crafting. Turned toward me, then went back to it. Told him to give it back. Nothing as he uses all my shit. So I blew the shit out of his Power Armor Station. With no reaction, AGAIN, I just went ahead and started leveling his base. He server hopped, but only after I'd taken out anything worthwhile. 
---
If he'd fought me for it fair and square, I wouldn't have done that. But when you can get ganked with very little warning at a workshop and have literally 0 ability to retaliate when they pick up and leave because it was "sanctioned pvp", you do what you have to do.
---
Honestly started just leaving my mic plugged in at all times now. People don't act like bullies as much when you have a voice. First time I made the mistake of having it unplugged somewhere "dangerous". Never again.
---
after leader of the pack you transition into a seperate event which is a wolf horde. horde events have a i beleive around 50% chance for the horde boss to be a legendary
---
If it eases your mind at all, my base has only been attacked 3 times in over 500 hours, and I just logged out and didn't have to fix anything. It's not great, but it's not so bad either. 
---
**WHY DO YOU TRUST THESE PEOPLE TO DO A SINGLE FUCKING THING PROPERLY? THIS IS AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, GET OUT.**
---
Yeah I logged out twice now. Gone through 3 old possum and I'll fuck with it tomorrow. So the daily turned into a weekendly. 😂 Damn bugs. 
---
Mods aren't allowed on pc. But I can direct you to the NukesDragons website. They provide you with a great layout of perk cards and what level to take them. 
---
First rule of fight club; dont talk about fight club
---
I know...I was just a little geeked. 
---
Just don't buy it, this is getting mad that other people are spending their money how they want to spend it
---
I am groot?
---
I remember the second time I logged in it took two crits to register, was a pain. Thought I'd have to hop again. I much prefer the dailies where you get and have to make a new recipe.
---
Lmao
---
There's a rare vendor that spawns there and if there's a camp it wont spawn.
---
You got a weapon? I just get armor that doesn't compliment my character. 
---
What's that? The most heavily used weapons in the game are breaking faster just before Bethesda introduces repair kits for real money? Gee, I wonder how that happened?
---
Isn’t Super Duper a high level perk? I’m level 22. 
---
That is probably never going to happen because, you know, copyright reasons. 
---
Yes, please! My best meelee gear is sitting in my sniper's stash while my melee char is using crappy gear
---
Yeah. This is the first time I've had this issue though. Hopefully a server resets or something by tomorrow and I'll have to go get some more aster for the Brew. 
---
I don't mean to be "that 1 guy" or anything but i don't think the SBQ is an accomplishment in this game. The reward pool makes no sense. She's a bullet sponge. She's only worth fighting if there is a melee spec to kill her. Her mechanic's seem lazy, there's 0 logic to the fight other then wait for her to land. 
---
Tbh though, i got the same Walking Cane from the Queen and its pretty badass. Troubleshooter, Faster Att Speed and Reduce Damage while Blocking. Makes running Silo's super easy. 
---
They need to either nerf melee or make the SBQ react to the melee damage she's taking and do something else. Like if she takes 80% melee damage maybe she should never land again. 
---
It’s not a camp. From the spawn literally run straight until you get to the workbench with the dead raider in the red ski car. You would have passed the raider vendor building on the left. A blue and red plan spawn in that area. The blue one can be BoS if you’re lucky. I got legs. Now need chest
---
Sometimes the SBQ body just straight disappears :/
---
Ah okay, wasn't sure if it would work like that cause I had it set to area and tried talking to someone the other day, but it seemed like they couldn't hear me
---
Thank you for the time and energy it obviously took to do this! Now I know where and how to get the rare T-60 paints!
---
No they’re not making money from the music, they’re building an in game player for people who own the right to play said music, I can’t be sued over copyright infringement if I play music on the the mic while playing the game apple cant be sued for making an iPod 
---
&gt; but in the latest demonstration competition before the bomb, the workers outpaced the robots when the workers used the excavator power suit.
---
Garrahan's Excavator Power Armor *lost* the event.
---
So, ditto, I haven’t received one off the Queen because the lag/glitches have prevented it.
---
But make sure you head to Watoga station after the event!
---
All the servers I’ve been on, the players head there afterward and dump any plans they already know/loot/ammo in the blue suitcase there.
---
Nice piece of in-game cooperation, it’s allowed me to get rid of excess plans that are weighing me down and I’ve picked up a few ultracite plans that way too.
---
Obviously this isn’t a solution tho, Bethesda needs to sort the server instability around the Scorchbeast Queen fight out, like, yesterday.
---
Like I said I have no clue what i'm doing or what this stuff is worth.
---
Robots
---
You can always listen to whatever music you want when playing a game, but when you are streaming music to others online you need a license to do that. 
---
Any mods that just have the type on them Calibrated Shocks, Reactive Plates, Etc are for Excavator PA. Easiest way to tell us if the status of them shows Black Titanium.

This is an excellent starting point, however some things are a bit out of date on it. Let me know if there's any specific tips you want. :)
---
This is eerily similar to my stealth handmade build...
---
But if I’m at a party and streaming music for others that’s fine 
---
This^
---
It seems that you don’t really understand how copyrights work. 
---
The flood of non-stop messages would drive players mad.
---
Dang, well that stinks. The closest I have seen a nuke to the SBQ was last night someone nuked Watoga. First time I have seen that. Great spot to nuke if you want violet flux. 
---
Where is it? Nice job !
---
Im hoarding my atoms for the day they release brotherhood flags and weapons. Some deeper brotherhood integration would be nice, and some brotherhood fortifications in my camp.
---
It's the one thing I want the most currently. Brotherhood camp skins for barricades and whatnot. 
---
I never found a workaround. I ended up just reporting the bug and moving on with the quest line
---
The quest description really is misleading, a normal sneak attack won't do, but you don't need a critical hit, either. What you need to do is a POWER ATTACK from sneaking (R1 on PS4), that does the trick.
---
Yeah, it would make the game a smidge more interesting with clan, etc.   I'm always looking forward to what they have in store for us.
---
Ok and will the plan spawn inside of the ski car?
---
Copyrights protect from the sale or free exchange of hard copies of non authorized people, as in I cannot sell bootleg copies of a cd I cannot set up a pay streaming service without paid authorization of the rights to said music, I cannot give out free copies of music I paid for, but if I steam music from say Spotify while playing this game and others hear it how is that different than if I were playing it at a party ? 
---
This and losing your quick swap weapon after fast travelling or entering a building. 
---
I don't think OP thinks it's the underlying infra that's the problem.  It's Bethesda's game server software that OP is frustrated over. 
---
What this guy said is very true. I finished the main story at 44 and now I’m 51 and have no will to play the character because he doesn’t really have a build (I’m going for a heavy gunner) and I don’t wanna grind to get all the cards I need. Definitely take it slow and enjoy it. And find a build you like lol.
---
Well if you own a store and want to play music for radio or spotify you usually have to pay a fee (i don’t know if this apply to every country) because it’s commercial use, not private. Also if a game platform is using music in their game, they need to pay licensing fees. The jukebox you described in the first post would be using a game platform for streaming music without a paid lisence. 
---
Never mind I found the place! Thank you for the help
---
It’s honestly so bugged all the tine tho I have issues with it every week.
---
I manually need to set to default then mess with the levels again
---
Good god format this
---
4th time I checked, I got the XO1 Jetpack. I then proceeded to use it on my lvl 40 chest piece because nobody told me it couldn’t be reused. Still searching for calibrated shocks. 
---
Lone Wanderer is different to most other cards, in that its ‘one star’ version costs 2 perk points to equip.
---
Like other cards though, the cost to equip still only goes up by 1 with each level, so the ‘2 star’ version costs 3 points, and the ‘3 star’ version costs 4 points. 
---
If it says it cost 4 that's normal.  Level 1 costs 2
---
10/10

Fissure Fissure Fissure

On pc and haven't had issues with the monigah plant, but my wife had issues with drop outs at the poseidon plant, 3 times in an hour on Friday. She moved onto other things and hasn't had a drop since. Weird stuff. 
---
When I'm bored I'll usually just rub one out. Good hustle.
---
I used to work in a CD store and no license fee had to be paid for the music we played due to the fact it increases sales in fact we could open any CD we wanted to and let people listen before they paid, a radio station indeed has to and has to follow specific rules of how much of a certain region of music has to be played and in this case Canada it’s I believe 15% Canadian content 
---
You may be correct, but multi billion dollar companies have a way with working deals and if day I had to spend 30 bucks to link Spotify to my juke box in my camp then I certainly would 
---
Oh my god. I thought they were saying something else and it somehow comically sounded like fuck it. No way. Mind blown.
---
I would kill my mother with a broken lawn chair for Responders gear. 
---
Raider camp pieces really are lacking
---
Ok thanks for clearing that up for me. I find that confusing, but it's Bestheda I guess.
---
I have yet to see many players using VOIP.  IF they are, its generally higher level 20-50 year olds I've ran into.
---
Thanks
---
I mean, its a open world fucking video game.  Is he going to do that to everyone that enters the area they are in?  I mean shit, grow a pair of balls.
---
It's sad to see what's happening to the gaming industry, the guy's in suits have taken over and all they care about is quick profits.
---
It just catches people out sometimes because for most other cards, the card level and cost are the same number. 
---
There is also the option to turn chat completely off.  But for new users it would be on automatically until they learn the options are in audio menu of the settings
---
I seriously cannot wait... just wish the rest of my friends were interested in returning to the game :(
---
What about the coefficient of drag?
---
Yesterday I lucked out. Level 3 safe at freddy fears house of scares and I found bos arm plans. 
---
I guess I'm the weird one. I love the blue/yellow.

Bought them all. Different strokes for different folks.

How is pure flux made?

Shit man, that's fluid dynamics, not ass whooping dynamics

Logged out in front of him, logged back in and he was gone... Not the first time this has happened either.

Thanks again

DUDE THIS GAME IS DISASTER
---
Good call Guess I'll be rebuilding tomorrow I already rebuilt a shed in anticipation of vendors
---
Winner made over 3k with only 100 cap buy ins!!!! Wooo! Success!
---
yea waiting for downvotes...

Not technically unloaded. It only happens to the equipped weapon and of you either fast travel or wait long enough the ammo will show back up in the clip. If you reload the ammo that is not visibly there yet will then vanish. If you are a server hopper and reloadevery hop you will loose a lot of ammo This way. But the ammo is still there. Takes time to show up for whatever reason. Easy way to avoid this and losing ammo is to log out with a melee weapon. 
---
Cool
---
Im horrible with acronyms. Whats AFK?
---
I have had 6 CHR before i was taming so i don't know for sure.
---
😂 not gonna lie this has been the funniest exchange on this Reddit, man I talked to newton he said "you do you boo"
---
Well you were playing in survival mode and people show no mercy on those servers so this sounds like it's your fault ngl if you chose to go on adventure mode you wouldnt be having this problem 
---
I just travel to a safe location then exit the server.
---
less adderall
---
Can I have your junk??...........nevermind. The other guy already a took it.
---
Tell him I'll be waiting to hear back
---
The cosmetic items would probably feel less scummy if they werent so overpriced. Let alone the fact that a good number are simple retextures of existing content or ported from Fallout 4. Going a little further, artificial scarcity introduced by "limited time" stuff -- completely unnecessary, it already takes a while to save up Atoms and I'm not accruing enough Atoms vs the content that comes out.
---
The items that give an advantage are definitely creating issues though. We could be mid PVP and your gun broke. I think "haha, gotcha" and then you're just like "not today, I paid with my credit card!" and suddenly their weapon is repaired and they win the fight they should have lost. We were also promised it was only cosmetics if im not mistaken. We were all excited for a multiplayer Bethesda game for Fallout/Skyrim.
---
The path this company is taking is a huge turn off for me. They charge $60, items are priced like it's a F2P, except the game wasn't free and some of the content isnt actually new. That's just FO76... In Skyrim/Fallout 4 they shut out modders from making a percentage off their mods in favor of Creation Club, where only some modders get selected with a 1-time payment. Bethesda then gaslight people into thinking Creation Club content is "mini DLCs" when really it is paid mods.
---
Their community managers' silence kind of confirms they knew the backlash was coming, they just dont care. While the anger may eventually die down, I have lost more respect from their company and will be considering this going forward.
---
Lol ok man 
---
dude i know they dont have to mercy but i cant understand this he just becomes friendly and hostile randomly what i mean is in random times there is a red arrow some times there is a yellow arrow on top of his head and i cant even give a damage to him thats the point i have the greatest weapons for my level 
---
Just logged in with all three weapons I used unloaded lol
---
I’ll try logging out with melee 
---
i dont know how to explain situtation
---
Will do √
---
Hey i had mad fun at the event. Some good good fights. Worth the caps.
---
yea a bunch of fallout 76 fan kids just hanging around here.Just waste your time in pointless games
---
What?
---
Look all I have to say is that you should double check the server you are in trust me it will save you caps your aid and junk
---
+karma! 
---
Thanks man! I'm so glad I found Reddit! And rather than using it to complain about everything trying to do stuff to make the game fun as hell let's do it again soon!
---
Shooting them? Amatures. I got a easy bake oven. Burn baby burn!
---
If the item itself is indeed Meta then yeah. Metal means it's the most effective aka the best right? Bethesda can determine what is best to grind for it. A few hours, days, weeks etc. They made the game so they can make the rules for it. Other games have nasty grinding for meta weapons or equipment so 76 can have that too. Would an achievement stating you grinded for it instead of paying for it make it any better? 
---
Will I personally grind for weeks or buy that meta item? No. I also enjoy games for the fun factor. I don't have the time for more than several hours a week for 76 or much else. I also have never bought an end game or meta item in any game with real money. It's not my thing. 
---
It is also important to note that adventure mode and survivor mode should handle paid items differently. I think adventure mode should allow paid items if bethesda wants to. Realistically it is now a single player mode with other people playing on the same map at the same time. If another player has the best armor and guns in the game, that won't impact my play experience unless they follow me and kill everything before I can. Then I can just use that block button or switch servers. 
---
Paid items in survival mode however should NOT really be allowed. It defeats the entire purpose of the mode. Hopefully they will make players create new builds so you can't carry items or gear over to survival. 
---
Iv been griefed like 5 times. You get stronger, you build your armor weapons and perks up, and the game gets more fun. Its a survival game. Survival is supposed to be a challenge. 
---
&gt;Save
---
duuuuude i have a 230 games in steam and i know how the servers works very well and i know how to read something. I cant damage him (not about low quality weapons he becomes a friendly just like you cant damage friends in your team) but he can...
---
__Good god format this__
---
I mean, if one branch at one location was working on the t-60, then even with military base info it wouldn’t be too crazy to think “ohh 51b is definitly top of the line.”
---
As for the x-01,  you could at least explain that retcon as it was a concept piece pre-war. But was far too buggy or costly to effectively mass produce.    post war the bugs got worked out and patches were applied here and there thanks to the brotherhood, enclave, or institute intervention.
---
And In 76,  vault rev-military join effort had some of the buggy concept pieces in the area while people cheered the innovation of the vault and celebrated the tricentennial.
---
Tl:Dr:: 60 was a base-centric secret project.    X-01 were PoC pieces that couldn’t feasibly be produced.
---
I only have it happen to the one currently equipped. I was hopping and found that it caused me to loose ammo by reloading. Stopped reloading and learned it eventually showed back up. Check your ammo levels next time and see what happens. I lost a bee hundred rounds before I figured out what was happening to me. Happens to me most times I log in. Not just if I were to server hop. 
---
Good luck! Hope it works. 
---
Upvote because I need BOS T51 paint.. And a damn BOS flag Like...  Just take my money Todd damn it.... 
---

???
---
dude you are right but i dont know did you get the idea ?
---
basically you cant damage friendly players right ?
---
so that griefer becomes a friendly in game (im not talking about his character and what he thinks about me) it just technically becomes a friendly and when he wants he becomes a hostile to me
---
Possible you were in an event?
---
Well obviously not if you were faming junk items in survival mode and the person you were fighting was probably an alt from a higher lvl player trying to have some fun 
---
Tin Foil Hat.  I swear it attracts cryptids and it looks really really goofy.  Can be found at Ft. Defiance and a few other places.
---
You're very correct thanks for pointing that out. I actually only put it at 4 luck for 1 rank of starched genes without realising you needed the both ranks to completely neutralise radaways effect on mutations. Thank you. 
---
Thank you. I'm not usually the type of person who writes backstories for the builds I make but i've been watching some of fudgemuppets build video's and felt inspired. 
---
Yes, the inconsistency threw me because for the other cards that go over three, each star equates to a level. But for some reason, not with this one.
---
I used to put my camp next to overseers when I had plans for making it a little marketplace. As for the shooting?... assholes?  Yea I'm gonna go with assholes
---
I forget.  You could get a higher level friend to share it.
---
Though you're obviously right because it's an easy and commonly accepted opinion... I think you fell right into what Skidderik was describing. He didn't say anything about gameplay or that you *can't* have a beautiful world with bad gameplay, but thats what you went for with your reply. He/she was stating that gamers call a game complete shit if everything isn't perfect even if one thing is done exceptionally well and exceptionally better than most games. They'll say its complete shit in every way. Yet some gamers go for the negative only and stick to it. As for your metaphor, no one fell through the map in this game besides when some people's modded games didn't work with a new patch, which was easily and instantaneously fixed for those who gave 2 seconds to find out why.
---
So yes a beautiful world *does* matter in this game since you do not fall through the map in this game. And yes, a game can have positives and negatives. OP did not state otherwise. 
---
I thought you were gonna transfer hi. Some children hahaha
---
dont have any idea
---
no i was 8 level and he was 12
---
Assholes that can't even hurt anyone lol 
---
Just dick heads that have nothing better to do 
---
I’ve not managed to beat her yet, I always seem to be with loads of other players but nobody seems to be able to do any damage at all. 
---
Only 2-3 bother taking her down the rest run around fighting scorched or collecting flora 
---
I’d hate if I managed it finally and got sod all 😅
---
It is still possible that the person you were fighting was an ALT of a higher lvl player
---
Im up to the point of reinstalling the game, done every trouble shooting step they have given me and said they cant help further.
---
That is strange, I fought her there on numerous occasions and she normally lands just fine around the V9. Well, a bug is a bug is a bug.
---
I don't actually care that they were playing, but 
---
" those kids have just as much a right to play as you regardless of their behavior so long as they dont break the ToS. " 
---
Their age -is- violating TOS. 
---
Elaborate please. 
---
Still unloaded after fast travel for me. 
---
Can I just ask why so many serums?
---
I think... they should put some kind of structure on the map, and if you occupy it you can broadcast a new radio channel as the host. Players would get a signal about a new radio channel. People have basically done this in previous games with their own dedicated youtube channels or what not for it. 76 is about emergent gameplay caused by players.
---
Or something similar after the first two or three way back when I have just dropped everyone of those holotapes because it's pointless
---
Thats not true. They are allowed to play with adult consent. Parents can give permission for kids under the recommended age to play.
---
For the record? I'm trained as a DJ, am Southern, and will work for cheap.  
---
Just sayin'.
---
the idea is to make them useful beyond levels 1-5 as it stand you can use materials of any kind at any level 
---
I see what you did there...
---
Yeah, Marathoner doesn't do anything in PA. Serendipity too.
---
no just be a cosmetic so we can use it with robot marine or combat armor
---
Oh i agree with you I was just stating that I would like your idea or something similar to it
---
same here its why there is such an outcry from fans
---
Pre-war money, my friend. pre war money. You get sacks of it.
---
It's all in caps with 0 line breaks. No one's going to decipher what you have piece by piece.
---
I don't disagree.  But hundreds within 5 minutes?  That's the secret sauce I want in on.
---
ah if there was to be more items added what would your choice be? more aid items more guns/ammo more mats like in the post or something else?
---
Actually, I would not be surprised if it's in the basement of that one medical building with the somewhat questionable equipment in it.
---
i cant see how that would benifit them currently but its good to remain vigilant 
---
I'm a dataminer. I know where the entrances actually are. There are 2 manholes in harpers ferry, one on each side of the town. 
---
May be a different bug then. For me, if I sign out or server hop with a ranged weapon equipped and then draw it the peapon shows an empty mag. But the ammo is still there and does eventually load after 40 seconds or so or if I fast travel, but I can avoid the issue by just using my melee weapon as my primary when I sign out or if I server hop.
---
I can agree 100% on this one
---
Fair enough. Having checked through the TOS,  I stand corrected. Though i also suspect 99% of the player base  is technically in violation of the TOS anyway, since the TOS require you to actually read the TOS and not just click accept &gt;&lt;  
---
Please don't tempt them
---
This is also a rated M for mature, I had kid tell me he wants some pvp restrictions on survival. Like WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. 
---
Lol, true. Haha. Nobody reads any gaming or social media ToS. 
---
Well I'll go make that change thank you for letting me know.
---
Silver is the only material which can be sold without bulking, has it's own dedicated resource collector, and doesn't require you to smelt ore.  With decent charisma and the better prices from vendors perk you can get 2 caps per silver scrap.  100 silver scrap weighs 5lbs and outside of some outfits/chems this weight to caps ratio is about as good as it gets.
---
The night tours are the best. I've been on 3 before and I'm planning a 4th for the fall! 2ish hours on each floor to roam as you like after a short tour with the guide. It is pretty creepy, though.
---
Heh, to be fair i usually do, just 'cause of that one time gamestation(?) put ownership of your soul into their TOS to make a point about no-one reading them &gt;&lt; 
---
He made a point and I made a counter point
---
His point was that the game was beautiful and that gamers complain too much. 
---
My point was that the game is hard to enjoy with broken gameplay. If it wasnt the one glitch I made a reference to it would be one of the countless other ones. 
---
I'm not telling anyone to not enjoy the game for what it is. But if you want to say gamers are complaining too much maybe take a good hard look at all the promises broken to paying customers. 
---
They specifically say it is the start of more to come. Read the article.
---
You really shouldn't play survival mode if you're new. The point of survival mode is literally to kill other players and get bigger rewards.
---
bee barrel that gives you hivescabs anytime you take damage it spawns a swarm of bees
---
So who do all those souls belongs to now since they are gone?
---
Awesome. thank you. 
---
May I ask if you have a screenshot of how the Paladin paint looks? :) I'm very curious to see, I got my BoS II paint the other day and was over the moon for it, now that I know there's a BoS VII ..well whew there's a grind ahead of me for sure! :P I can only find Fallout 4-screenshots when I search google for pics.
---
Dude is your cat ok it looks a little sick might need to get a mr.handy vet to take a look at him
---
Think we could get some -non-atom store Enclave paint too ? I mean, we don't even have any atom store paint right now either, but i'll be pretty damn angry if there is no free enclave paint given the 4(?) paint jobs BoS get as in game rewards.
---
Let’s face it, all events should have a 3 star legendary at the end 
---
Yea but if your a new person who just bought the game after the hate died down it's pretty funny to see them scatter.  Yes I'm an asshole, but an asshole who gives some aid items after im done having my laugh
---
My way of making caps :3
---
..username checks out. 
---
Pretty sure when they announced what they'd been doing and how few people had actually said anything, they legally relinquished all claim to them &gt;&lt; i'd have to google it and search, and i'm honestly not 100% it was GS and not somewhere else, this was freakin years ago. 
---
Agreed! They have had the atomic shop all wrong since day 1. They really need to work on some decent post apocalyptic outfits, handfuls of weapons skins and camp items. 
---
Yes it made me
---
Upset that I did the parade like 15 times and only got one legendary because it the sloth would freeze.
---
Lol. "Name checks out" perfect
---
Minigun gang💪
---
Thats why there is cooldown
---
I agree but it feels like them 'testing the waters' to see how much we will kick off over things, a week ago this subreddit was filled with "Thank you!" And "It's such a good game now." And now that repair kits are out it's clearly lost stock with its players, again. 
---
I just though it would be handy to say I see it as a minor symptom, the diagnosis could either me it's them trying stuff out and trying to figure out how to make more money from the atom store without going Pay2Win, but it could also be them trying to see what response they would get if they went Pay2Win, without going full Pay2Win right away. 
---
Only time will tell and posts like this might stop them leading towards Pay2Win and make them try something that's more beneficial to the player base to make some easy cash. 
---
I just hope we don't push them towards a Subscription based product like World of Warcraft.  
---
It’s different because it means the music is being reproduced on Bethesda’s servers. If it’s audible to others It then effectively becomes part of the game soundtrack for any players that hear it. Bethesda is a big company with lots of money, so they can and will be sued for doing that without a license agreement. 
---
If you pipe music into your mic on area chat that’s still technically copyright infringement—but it’s unenforceable. It’s also obnoxious. 
---
When you log into a survival survivor check the leaderboards that way you can see if people are PvPing or grinding xp. Server hop until you find what you’re looking for
---
It needs a barrel mod with a bipod to hold as a hip-fired foregrip from a certain anime like (this)[https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/826819056198934921/31F9A5EB7D323FD2433C2CAA65A225E16A669BD4/].
---
I don’t have a mic it’s bad enough listening to people breathing and eating, I’ve initiated contact with Spotify to see what possibilities there can be, both could easily work together to make that happen and as your original post stated about new ways to bring money in and my suggestion which was taken way off topic, a good cross platform could bring in the possibility of new people to both Spotify and Bethesda 
---
This looks pretty fun :)
---
Nothing better than when we can chat to a female gamer on a mic and hope to god mom doesn’t come down to our basement and yell at us 😂😂😂😂
---
I bet you're not telling the whole story
---
From keyshop (cdkeys); I think that those crazy offers we had after launch are gone now. Still, it is $10 more than it should cost us for this feature.
---
Things like this are why I love that slap damage was removed. 
---
This isn't a big deal. It's not a cosmetic but it's not in any way a pay to win item. It gives no advantage to people that know how to play the game. 
---
For real. I just looked at him and thumbs down, then went back to harvesting plants. 
---
How is this pay to win? 
---
For a second there I thought you were talking about actual real world tax havens ;)
---
I checked and the lists are both completed 17 out of 17 and 6 out of 6.
---
 But the side quest in the pip boy Data still shows Overseer's mission incomplete?
---
That's the HOA spirit! :)
---
Not gonna lie I try to reload and die lol
---
I'm not new new. Dude was only level 77 while I am 55. 
---
I’m now finally - unfortunately - to this place as well. No longer... “OMG, Legendaaaaaryyyyy!!!!What did I get!?l”. But now, “ok, what crap do we have today....”
---
I've been using an average max condition auto combat rifle and haven't been having any problems. At least not any that I'm really noticing tbh.
---
Evilness? Really? They're a business. The entitlement you people have these days is bizarre. 
---
How about your secondary weapon no longer on the hotkey after fast travel? I have my main weapon ready, switch to your backup and are looking at balled fists not the savior you were expecting. I always test the secondary weapon hot key and make sure all weapons are fully loaded.
---
With or without VATs? With VATs you can roleplay as an enhanced soldier. 
---
But survival based... Limit yourself to certain weapons. Decide whether you want to go sneak or not. To give yourself a challenge, do a bloodied build where you can deal great damage but once detected your are very vulnerable. Rewarding but somewhat difficult since you are a glass cannon. Use a crossbow! 
---
Or use a hunting rifle without VATs making for rewarding headshots. 
---
Utilize "carnivore" mutations to force you to hunt.
---
Make a small mobile CAMP
---
I just want to be as powerful. At one point the guy just sat there and laughed at me while my two shit explosive did some damage he quickly got me back with one shot.
---
Do you have chameleon? I've heard that messes with it.
---
Even he's mutations killed me. I want to have an even playing field.
---
I had a hell of a time, took me a week to get Officer after getting Knight Sgt. I've taken a short break before I resume the grind for Paladin.
---
I'd also suggest adding Monongah Power Plant to your list of places to raid for data. There's about a dozen cabinets in the control room that can spawn it and maybe 1 directly outside, the control room and at least two up a flight of stairs from the control room. 
---
I don't but I wish more females had mics on ps4 as well... Good luck ladies!! 
---
But you can buy the items with Atoms your earn in game. You're arguing just to argue. 
---
The public outcries for piterally anything now. It's a pout fest. 
---
And isn't it supposed to be in caps? 
---
I thi I the less time you take placing things, the more realistic it looks. Real short of lived in looking.
---
Sounds like that Level 200 had the White Knight perk equipped.
---
Yeah I agree, its like if I just popped a chair down in this room would I take twelve years to line it all up perfectly with the furniture? If the answer is no, there chair goes where I see fit.
---
If the answer is yes, well maybe you've got some OCD tendencies ^notthatthatsabadthing
---
Why the downvotes? I just want to have some fun instead of dying immediately. Can anyone give me some tips?
---
If your in a team you can hear each other from anywhere, but when you talk to someone who isn't in your team it is proximity, meaning it's louder the closer you are to them
---
How would NPCs solve anything
---
Yeah sure...
---
Or visible mutations....
---
Elder looks basically like the Knight rank with a different logo on the forearm. It's actually kind of disappointing. Officer and Paladin are black and orange and sentinel would be as well.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
More armor and weapon skins!
---
Times like that a nyah nyah emote would be better
---
Is that considered new? Help me out. I got 3 star weapons and some armor pieces. What am I doing wrong? I also got the insult bot giving me shit at my camp now.
---
Maybe as your own radio on your pipboy I think it would work, but streaming to your jukebox at your camp I’m dunno how the legal side of things work work! Definitely as your pipboy radio would be good!! 
---
Im level 65 and harldy ever die. 
---
The enclave and BoS vendor carries them
---
When people broke into the Dev Room and got the plans, I saw someone with the Elder paint and assumed it was just unfinished because it looks so...bland. That and it didn't match with FO4. I'll want to get the paint plan to complete the collection but I doubt I'll use it.
---
Man this screenshot is perfect. XD
---
Come to think of it the six pack rings probably don't exist in Fallout. Soda/pop and beer were shipped in wooden crates. Maybe booze stronger than beer was shipped in plastic?
---
What boggles my mind is that they're doing this in Adventure.
---
It's like they're "too tough" for Adventure but too bitch for Survival. 
---
"How can I grief without getting griefed!?"
---
Where?
---
This would have to be a cross permission platform, a deal struck with Bethesda and say Spotify for use with all Spotify accounts 
---
That’s always gonna be coming in! 
---
Adrenal Reaction(2) Healing Factor(2). Me "sleepy4792". 
---
Assassin/sentinel armor or else is what i hear
---
I'm level 18 and hardly ever die haha I killed a level 77 player a few minutes ago lol 
---
Yeah, (another way to make money) you’d have to download a pipboy app, same as fallout 4 that you would have to download and use that to stream to 76 
---
It's a good idea and I've actually been thinking about it.
---
However to balance it out, I suggest a hard cap to how many caps you can store in it safely. It should really serve as just an emergency funds stash rather than being a way to prevent players from earning caps through killing.
---
I had never heard about this. I loved jumping puzzles in Guild Wars 2 so this is intriguing. 
---
I'm also a girl on Xbox but I prefer to go solo for comfort reasons.
---
Inside the bunker, the vendor pass the code room.
---
Still need a power armor stand?
---
I figured it was. BUT on the off chance that .....
---
"Let's just pick on low level characters and see if anyone tries to defend themselves, dur hur!"
---
I got a drill and a 2\* underleveled Anti-Armour combat rifle....binned both of them out of frustration.
---
I agree there should be more! I would gladly lay down some atoms for them. :)
---
I need the mods the terminal has the plan to build it
---
#neckbeardproblems
---
First:  If you're going to play Survival, you'd better be in that mentality. No permanence, base building will risk base destruction, and your caps are fair game.
---
That said, I created a new character to play Survival on. I do not have a base, I use public benches, and move my camp any time I'm a decent distance from a train station and want a safe point to respawn/ fast travel to while I quest or farm an area. At level 9, I killed a level 88. Multiple times. Level doesn't matter so much if you play smart, shoot well, and use every advantage you can give yourself. I'm level 13 and I've killed dozens at this point, just by playing smart and stealthy, and shooting people in the back. I don't care about being fair. I care about winning and surviving. I've died one time, when I was killing the level 88 the third time, another player with Chameleon gear came up behind me and shot me in the back point blank. My CAMP unit was 30 feet away, so I came back and killed him (level 35) and got my stuff back.
---
Play like your life depends on it and you'll enjoy it more when you succeed. But remember that it's just a game, and given that Bethesda didn't think it through and let incredibly geared characters jump in and go against anyone, eventually someone will kill you. Accept it and move on - the only equal playing ground you get is the foundation you lay with good playstyle.
---
Hmmmmmm
---
Something something careful what you wish for something something?
---
Not everyone is a weirdo out here. 
---
I would gladly pay for it, Bethesda needs a constant stream of money to put the best effort they can into bringing us great stuff in game, and I’m not much of one for skins outside of what I can by with free atoms, maybe like a 5$ a month Bethesda + subscription get some cool extras for quality of life, like music and better camp budget for decorations and stuff (no increase to how many turrets can be used) something I would gladly pay to keep this game pumping out the good stuff 
---
I've gotten a couple pieces of 3\* armor..keeping for Legendary Vendor....as well as all other 3\*  weapons that I don't want.
---
Same here man. 
---
I will join  I wanna fight 
---
No, not that. I just like playing alone, been that way since I was a kid.
---
I've been dealing with this one also.  I hope they fix it on Tuesday.
---
You do realize that everyone past level 50 are basically the same level right? You don't get any more Special points after that, just perks.
---
You can get a build going by 50 if you plan it out and perfect it for sure before hitting 60.
---
you get mods by deconstruction afaik/remember. plans = how to build 
---
Gimme 3minutes
---
My bad 
---
Might be just xbox lol😜 I don't have that many issues with weirdos on ps4 thank goodness... Plus I play with a group of guys that are super protective of woman as they all are married and have daughters
---
I find that I encounter the mothman frequently if I have a camp in high areas of the forest region. 
---
When you join. Teleport to the overseer's camp
---
BoS vendor is in Watoga shopping center.
---
100%
---
I know only cosmetics are good but (like myself) with SO many cosmetics in the game you stop getting them, unless they are really good, there’s a lot of potential for this game and I hope the listen to what people want for purchases in the atom shop! 
---
I have 3 pieces of Weapon weight reduction and 1 (technically 3) Ammo reduction armors...2 of the  ammo reductions are in my stash as they take up the weapon reduction slots.  Weapon ones are more valuable...imo. I can carry like 20 Miniguns on me, no issue, plus my regular load out of 4-6 rifles, fatman, gatling laser and gatling gun
---
Only down side is that, if you're carrying a lot of weapons, then you get in PA, even with Calibrated Shocks, you could potentially be over encumbered.
---
Did you read the truck advertisement? It’s a Lobster Truck!
---
I'm not on now. I'll be on tomorrow afternoon. Eastern Time. I'll reach out to you here. Thanks.
---
Ive seen him in every region. Its random and usually in between locations. Ive seen him several times on the whitesprings golf course also.
---
I think the issue is more that you arent going into survival prepared properly, and not the levels. At level 35 I was doing ok for myself in survival.
---
Stop trying to scapegoat Bethesda just because you have a shit internet connection. 
---
worst is when it's a Gatling laser with like 10-12 shots left, reloading it swapping weapons and then back to the Gatling laser and it's back to the original 10-12 shots...
---
Will do 👍
---
Doesn't matter if they set that price or not, only a fraction was actually for maintaining the servers and the rest was profit. That 1$ per player paid for running the server, i already mentioned that, including the staff to run it. Not just the servers for WoW, but all there servers could be run on just WoW players paying 1$ a month.
---
Expansions were all full price or almost full price release. Covering it's own development cost and then some. Cashshop items obviously cost money as well.
---
Oh and i forgot to mention WoW itself also cost money to buy and came with only a 30day subscription.
---
The only thing developers were doing that was paid for by the subscriptions were content patches every 6months and ongoing bug fixes, tweaks and balance changes. However i don't believe players should have to pay for bugfixes so i am not going to include that.
---
So all the extra costs you mention i've already covered. Blizzard made an absolute killing with WoW. I'll just restate what i said before. I'm not saying this was bad or Blizzard shouldn't have done this.
---
I am challenging the idea that some people still have that apparently an online game needs 15$ a month from each of it's users just to keep running. WoW back in 2010 could've done all of it for 2$ a month, but as you said why wouldn't ask more if people were willing to pay it? So long as we are clear that that was not operating cost.
---
I just did this to my system today and make it runs WAY smoother now!  Thank you so much!
---
Now I am going to try this ReShade stuff.
---
Spawns in the mire around Abbie's Bunker and had 1 spawn at nuked fissure prime and seen 1 near  The Generals Steak house by the pretty Sundew Grove.
---
I’ve got about 3000 atoms to spend and I’ve grabbed a few things a couple pa paints the lever the alpine horn which I love, but knowing they’re possibly gonna go on sale doesn’t make me jump on them to get them when they first hit the stores
---
When will the update happen?
---
Fireproof, adamant skeleton
---
Been using a 1* suppressor Gauss repaired to 200% as my primary weapon since before the survival patch. An have noticed no difference. Course I have maxed ranked (5) weapon Smith always equipped so don't know if that helps. But I go thru about 1500 rounds of the Gauss before I even get to 125% durability. So for me it's not breaking any faster than normal. 
---
Thanks, it was a labor of love (that turned into a labor of annoyed, then hate, and finally desperation) 
---
Yeeeaahhh I went through the motions of getting rid of plague walker and reacquiring the ones I’d lost in the process because of this bot. Level 130ish when I finally got him, and that damn mutation messed it up. I found him a couple times since. Lady Janet’s soft serve is a better spot than the Charleston station btw
---
How do you know this? Seems very unlikely to me, since it would cost much more than operating those yourself. Contrary to what they often say, they already had experience with multiplayer games on this engine (Elder Scrolls Online) so having infrastructure and staff in place wouldn't surprise me. They just had to expand it (assuming they had it for ESO).
---
But even if we were to assume that they rent it from Amazon, his complaint does not become invalid. If current hardware is not enough, Bethesda either needs to throw more money, let us host games ourselves or improve performance of their netcode so that budget servers can handle it.
---
I'd kill for a "The Pack" themed Handmade skin.
---
I'd really like some BoS themed combat and sniper rifle skins.  I rock the BoS Bomber jacket in game and it'd totally complete my look....I also need a BoS beret...
---
I went in level 21 on Thursday and came out level 46 tonight.  It can be hard for lower levels so maybe consider going in a group.  
---
For me it melts I just fixed it and after doing a line in the sand event shooting maybe 50 bullets it's already 150% after doing the enclave bots in parade and shooting 25 rounds it was barely over 100%.  For all I know it could be a bug on xbox
---
There really isn’t a ton to develop with the Children of Atom. They’re a cult that worships nukes and radiation. Most of their backstory was covered in Fallout 3, so they were already a somewhat thoroughly developed minor faction by the time Fallout 4 rolled around.
---
This is my mentality. I don't care about my camp or caps. I just don't want to be one-shot killed or is that the whole point of this game? I know levels don't matter so I didn't understand why that dude told me if I'm new I shouldn't play thats BS. What advantages am I not seeing? Help me build a stronger character?
---
Kinda down to follow your unmarked quest...
---
&gt; they seem to always drop garbage for me
---
This is anecdotal. If you're looking just to farm, whitespring is your best option full stop. The reason it feels like they drop garbage is because it's where you get the most volume of mobs, specifically legendaries. Because you get the most loot there, you get to really see that the loot tables are garbage, not whitespring.
---
I totally played games like this as a kid. Sometimes with my step brother of the same age. We’d get into shenanigans and sometimes get spooked (people could be creepy in the early internet days). But ya know what? Nothing happened! We were not traumatized by the violence, no one’s griefing couldn’t be dealt with, and we got into trouble of our own.
---
Shit, we played Resident Evil and hacked Halo maps and Silent Hill and all kinds of stuff. Worst case scenario was a nightmare or a jerk we had to log out to get away from.
---
I started a brand new character in survival and played 80 percent in survival. I’m currently level 20 and have had no issue killing level 100+ it’s more challenging since I’m very ill equipped but it’s doable. 
---
I run into him lots when hopping lady Janet’s for the vendor bot
---
While it is beautiful (best lighting in a game engine ever, change my mind), my main point is that the world is so detailed compared to anything else.
---
Everything was put where it is manually, painstakingly designed and molded by hand. Now take this into the account when you look at the map size.
---
Yes the engine is dated and the framerates aren't great, but considering the size of the map and the, literally, unlimited draw distance, I'm not sure any other engine would do any better. 
---
I much prefer technology. The institute was the first time I actually contemplated a faction choice. The lack of black she white choices really put me in a dilemma lol
---
Seriously, so annoying. AND when I fast travel my "last used" weapon disappears so I have to sit there and set it up again. 
---
oh ..huh, well ..that was too bad, indeed :P I had hoped perhaps they would have some defining features like a --maybe not cloak/cloak'ish thing lol, but something other than another logo. In any case, thank you for the response (Y) much appreciated!
---
Exactly. Greedy CEO's ruined the launch so hard.
---
And it's not like Bethesda was needing the money, either.
---
Just look at the way Blizzard has been acting since Mike Morhaine left / got pushed out.
---
He had a genuine interest in the gamers, because he's a gamer at heart.
---
Fucking Diablo for phones. 
---
They just want your cookies.
---
The real stupid thing was turning on voice chat. This is an online game. Nobody has anything worthwhile to say. :P
---
Ya, it could actually have a lot of good teachable moments for growing up online.
---
Kids: “This person visited our CAMP and it startled us!”
---
Teach them that’s a normal part of online games and a good way to make friends when they’re old enough. Nothing to be afraid of if their intentions are good.
---
Kids: “This person griefed/camped/killed us!”
---
Teach them that this happens and how to report/avoid these people while learning not to take it too hard emotionally.
---
I know that’s easier said than done when I comes to parenting, but ultimately it’s better that people learn instead of being shielded.
---
Not sold any, its tradeable as long as you don't learn it.  As you have to learn the paint to get the next level of plans I am assuming these things are going to be pretty rare on the market place.  
---
 Weirdly Elder, the last one, is going to be the most common as this can be farmed, although it'll still be expensive due the shear effort of farming them.   Other stuff like rare apparel is a passive hunt whilst doing other cool activities, tech data is pure 100% ball achingly dull grind.  
---
 The other thing is, once the buyer learns it, they, presumably, have no chance at getting the other paints, so.... I dunno if there is a market other than a full set. (Hey, Cap Billionaires, I have a full set)
---
Form a squad that follows around OPs squad from a distance with binoculars.
---
Rare to find, plasma cores are used for the Gatling Plasma, which is a plasma version of the gatling laser. However, any energy weapon breaks way too fast (after about 2 reloads for heavy energy weapons). 
---
I feel that pain, 40ish for me. 
---
Apparently I missed them selling a golden gun skin for the .44 on a timer? I also would love a skin for the super sledge, ask long as it gets rid of the rocket roar when your holding it. Doesn’t even matter what it looks like.
---
That sounds awesome! They could use the Sentry Bot voice (imagine that deep voice booming from a suit of X-01 armor. More intimidating than coming from the obviously inhuman Sentry Bot), speaking in the strange style MODUS uses, like when he takes over Assaultrons and Gutsys in the Bots on Patrol events, where they gain his weird style of speaking, with the pauses and strange emphasis on this. 
---
And yes, they could operate in the bunker. I think instead of being a random encounter, it could be an event, where MODUS alerts you that an .... \*error\* has occurred, and that he has accidentally lost control over a suit or two of power armor, and authorizes you to eliminate them through any means necessary, and if parts survive, you can keep them, since the fabrication systems of the bunker seem to have no issue churning out robots and could probably make power armor as well. 
---
You dont have to add people each time... just screenshot your recent players then join if theyre appearing online. I used xbox
---
175?
---
I don't want it.
---
If there are people who really want it, I wouldn't be *against* it being added for them as long as I can 100% turn it off. If something doesn't bother me, I don't really care what is added.
---
Probably because they dont want us to get any good items. Ive lost a few as well and the other day if it wasnt for having subtitles on i wouldve walked right past a legendary mutant. 
---
It's a Protectron and it has 2 Eyebot bodyguards. Sells 2 unique CAMP plans (Nuka Cola Cap wall clock and Cuckoo Clock) as well as rare and unique clothing items.
---
He can also spawn near an Ice Cream shop elsewhere on the map.
---
because goofier items and paints are better apparently
---
Why? Presume you are referring to people killing you in PvP mode after event finishes?
---
I have been running nukes on fissure prime as much as I can bare (21x) this past week and have not really had many problems aside from the DC today where we dropped 3 in an hour on Prime with a shaky to begin with server. Since the booze update I have not had a single spinning wheel on the Queen, a few server stutters here and there but otherwise really smooth fights. I think a lot of people commenting might not have tried her since the update; it seems like no one is nuking Prime anymore unless I do it myself. 
---
Nice one! If I were a betting I'd bet the next drop will be very soon. (the universe needs to balance that bad luck)
---
I’ve always thought it was to make the prize that much harder to obtain. That said, they could have  had a more lore friendly reaction: hiding, even stalking, rather than running away. Have the supermutants whisper that you’ll never find them until it’s too late. Gutsy engaging stealth mode - that kind of thing.
---
There's also a Witch's costume  that can be used for this as well. 
---
Yeah, the post assumes that people know what to do with it, sorry, added a line to explain. but essentially - 
---
 Technical Data is found in Round filing cabinets, cigar shaped bins and some desks, Once you have completed the Brotherhood of Steel mission "Forbidden Knowledge" you can turn in this in this data at the basement room of Camp Defiance, there is slot in the wall that you can use. There is XP, Caps and loot to be had, the more you submit the more XP and Caps you can get (This max's out at 4 pieces)
---
I've got 3 Luck, and I seem to get one of the BOS paint schematics about 1:25 runs, maybe? I've gotten up to Paladin so far. Not too bad to farm.
---
I'm old and understand that $60 is far below what games should cost now, I have no problem buying stuff to help the games. Back when KI Gold/N64 cost $90 I wondered how much shit would be in 20 years lol
---
There was a workaround, which was if the sloth froze, to fast travel to Helvetia the run back to the parade where you could loot the sloth. I had to do this half of the times.
---
Still, there with both the sloth and queen when I helped kill them, but then got almost nothing as rewards, like a few 10mm rounds.
---
This idea would resolve all of the outcomes.
---
Yes, sorry, should of added a disclaimer that some Ammo always drops, and I did not track that.  Fixed. 
---
I finally figured this one out after I followed another player and he told me the deal with the code. So far I’ve only found that plan too, looks like it’s the only one that spawns.
---
It’s probably more like this is the first time they’ve managed to get their engine online, so it only has barebones functionality for now. :)
---
Other online games either had years to develop their features or were built from the ground up with multiplayer in mind. Bethesda falls into the former camp, as they continue to iterate on their engine.
---
I’m a girl on Xbox, feel free to add me: Love Me Hate Me. I actually don’t run into problems anymore with guys. I used to waaaay back on Halo 2, but I think it’s more common now and they’ve realized our awesomeness ;)
---
Yes, to the point where the game feels slow without it once you get used to having it. The movement speed and reload speed are a must for any build.
---
Doesn’t compliment your character.
---
Insults it.
---
Heh.
---
Also items that go to far on a list can they not end with the ellipsis because there are times when it’s something small but I would prefer a giant list or something that tells me everything that I can preview. 
---
No
---
It's worth it even without Class Freak
---
Is the food/water issue that bad? I keep hearing that it's bugged right now with Class Freak 3
---
No u
---
No.
---
😐
---
Trash game
---
Agreed, the downside isn't a special either, so it's definitely worth it.
---
A gaussrifle skin Would be cool
---
#No U
---
.
---
After sbq it ends and the high levels just mowed down 10 lowbies and kept them from their loot
---
even if bugged, nothing downing 50 mutfruits down your throat cant fix. The mutation is just that valuable.
---
*sprayes face with water* bad opinion!
---
K
---
Mine is my helmet always being unequipped
---
Honestly lowbies as you call them probably shouldn't be at a queen drop. Just makes the queen have more health and harder to kill for everyone else.
---
Silos arent even remotely hard once you have a proper build, just time consuming.
---
Hey, have any of them dropped since the new paint was added? 
---
*sorays face with water again* this game bad!
---
Hey, thanks for the down vote for disagreeing. Next time, I’ll remember that I don’t rate to voice a different experience. 
---
Players: We don't want this 
---
Bethesda response: You wanted this
---
My Man!
---
Maybe have them drop weapon plans. Great for low levels and high levels alike. 
---
Lots of people expected player vendors too but hey look what happened there.
---
Encountered him at whitesprings once, But I still have never came across the Flatwoods  monster.
---
Really? I've never seen one there
---
Top Work, So, for tech docs, I've only ever seen them in round filing cabinets, cigar shaped bins, blue metal desks and the wooden desks in the bunker, and of course Safes.  
---
 That would make Harpers Ferry - 3 Cabinets and 15 cabinets.  
---
Do you concur, or have you found any in the ordinary cabinets as well, as that would be a bit of a game changer. 
---
This is a battle we can't win. The uneducated, immature and children have got the majority amongst gamers. It this demographic that allows companies to act the way they do.
---
Next step on the horizon: losing ownership of your games. The future is rental. 
---
Repair kits should have been possible to build or buy within the Appalachia economy but they are definitely are not pay to win. 
---
Perk loadouts?  Nah,everyone knows how repair kits were such a heavily requested feature.
---
This is what I keep wondering over and over again. Zenimax would obviously lend resources to its own asset in order to make as much money as possible... that’s why it’s extra hard to imagine that BGS would not be using basic online systems like loot dropping at your level or item-for-item trades, since ZOS does them successfully.
---
By lowbies i mean people 40-70...
---
Shouldn’t they have spent years developing features before selling the game, then?
---
Thanks, added! I guess like the silo's they may be a pain for the main to farm due to the fast travel spawn point, but great for an Alt to farm.  Will check the other power plants as well.
---
Lots of players have these issues, even on high end hardware. So far, Bethesda seems to ignore it.
---
Yeah, it's really handy. Class Freak 3 doesn't seem to change it at all, but it's not that big a deal to eat a few extra meals. 
---
Only ever seen it at 45
---
It’s like the new brewing in game it just needed time to ferment 
---
GREAT MINDS :-)
---
&gt; you spent thousands on world of warcraft, but are against anything but cosmetics
---
Yes, that's absolutely right. I, like a lot of other people, do not want pay-to-win microtransactions in this game (or any game that I play for that matter), or in other words, MTXs that give in-game power. The majority of the money I've personally spent on WoW has gone into paying a subscription, which I mentioned simply to point out that not all of us "older generation" gamers think that simply buying the game once should come with a lifetime access to new content and free servers.
---
&gt; How the F are they supposed to get any more money then.
---
With *cosmetic* microtransactions. It works like a charm for Path of Exile, for example, and their prices are completely **outrageous** compared to Fallout 76. Difference (aside from the much higher prices) is, of course, that you can't gain the virtual currency in game in Path of Exile; any cosmetic MTX you want to get in that game you'll have to pay money for.
---
Seems to work for them.
---
&gt; It certainly won't come from you.
---
Well, as I said earlier, when the currency is available in game, for me at least it tends to mean that I'd rather grind it myself than pay for it. So, while I definitely have no issue paying for cosmetic microtransactions in games, there's not been sufficient reason to do so in Fallout 76. Maybe the solution would be to remove the ability to gain in-game Atoms? Although that would rub a lot of people the wrong way, obviously.
---
nice idea perhaps at a as a chance to replace a rare materials?
---
Slap damage doesn't exist with pacifist on, so if you're getting killed it's kinda on you now. 
---
(Most of) The people that still play fo76 aka Bethesdarians, can not be reasoned with. They will never say anything negative about the game, its all features in their minds. 
---
I agree with you though. 
---
My credentials: 
---
-Preordered 6months in advance
---
-Played(read: suffered) through 1 month of laggy and buggy hell.
---
-Logs in occasionally to get disappointed again.
---
They could always make it 8mm Mauser
---
Oh, okay, cool. I thought you were being smarmy.
---
Depending on what you're up against, one shot kills aren't uncommon. Be sneakier. 
---
I suspect they were not being literal, but if you need cloth that bad and you're on PC, maybe I can hand some over next time I have a pile going.
---
That's lame. I dont want people trolling through my stash and dont want them taking the stuff for free as it took me a long time to gather it all. Of course lol I plan on keeping the really good stuff for myself lol but I have anti armor, executioner, vampire, ghoul slayer, and furious weapons, several different legendary armor peices, various plans and ammo, some chems, and excess junk. I usually upgrade the weapons as best I can. 
---
Thanks! Added
---
Usually just wander in the vast land between locations away from roads and you'll find one eventually. The first one I ever saw was deep in the forest and I didn't know what I was looking at at first, until I saw two glowing red eyes. I was early level so I noped so hard out of there...
---
It does actually. Thanks.
---
I looked up the repair kits issue on YouTube, so at least I'm familiar with that now.
---
\**tosses a few spare screws OP's way*\* Problem solved \**thumbs up*\*
---
That would be cool too
---
Metal poles are so hard to place. Why are they so finicky? And you can connect them going down but you cant stack them atop each other?
---
Half height metal stairs would be awesome to have.
---
So about the placement logic, I don't think it's based on making structures that aren't too crazy, I think it's just based on the simplest way to define and store how a structure is assembled. 
---
As for these structures being unrealistic... I'm pretty sure the lore can explain all the problems away. How the heck does the C.A.M.P. device work anyways? Energy Waves or something?
---
I dont want people going through my stash but iv got too.much stuff, and pretty much all of it is legendary stuff. Anti armor, executioner, ghoul slayer, exterminator, and vampire weapons, cloaking  stuff, purified water, chems, some junk, ammo I dont use. I'll have a lot to sell and it will be priced cheap as I'm going to keep the prices to their stated value
---
I always support my porch, although the weird random "this pillar needs support" thing can make a mess of that too.
---
Excuse my ignorance but what it’s SBQ?

Its the honey badger???????

is this you? and are you still recovering from the bachelor?
---
Back pocket machete. 
---
I agree with everything you just said, but you can absolutely place the metal posts on top of one another, I've seen people use stacking posts to allow them to stack those staircases with the floor pieces.
---
Sorry dude, not me
---
I feel its needed on my pvp toon. Been leveling up another pve character with out it and it's very convenient to not have it. My vote is that it's a end game mutation to have, more of a hindrance for grinding and running the map.
---
Pretty sure there's no specific area where you'll always find him, but remote areas with lots of cliffs seem to be the best way to encounter one.
---
The deep south parts of the Savage Divide, pretty much the whole area surrounding Vault 96, has lots of cliffs overlooking areas.  
---
Mothman will usually spawn on the edges of these large cliffs 'stalking' players, this is how one will usually see you, and ambush you.  Now, I can't say for certain, but I do think that the more remote the area is, the better your chances of encountering cryptid such as Mothman, and the Flatwoods Monster is.  Incidentally, the Flatwoods Monster seems to share the same spawn zones as Mothman, but is a lot more uncommon than Mothman.  
---
But anyway, like I said, around these remote areas with lots of cliffs, if you spend your time just wandering and exploring, you'll most likely find one, but you can also just get really lucky and encounter Mothman in non-remote areas.  I've encountered around the Outskirts of Watoga, which is pretty unusual, since there are really no high places for it to hide and stalk you.
---
Just keep in mind that there is a variety called Stalking Mothman that will literally just stalk you, and upon sighting might attack you for a bit, but then after reaching a certain point will flee and vanish.  You can kill it before it flees, but I find it doesn't give the same rewards as the variety that actually attack you. If it's a vengeful mothman, then it will fight to the death.
---
that sounds like something he would say.
---
There is no axe 
---
Bro imagine playing the guitar with only one hand and shooting a hunting rifle with the other.
---
Fuck. Outta. Here. White. Knight. 
---
Would be nice to face 15+ at one time soloing and added 5-10 per other players.
---
That would feel more like a horde. 
---
Yeah the strange "no it can't be like that" glitches I get when building drive me up the wall, literally (looking at you weird invisible lip on foundation pieces.) Sometimes the game highlights green then, "nope can't do that, even though I basically said you could by highlighting it green"
---
Yeah, I don't think I've found enough apparel for the averages to settle, my guess is there is an equal chance for any of them to drop, and this would show in the data if I got enough. 
---
Weird that the aid dropped in a near perfect 25% each straight away. 
---
This dude https://youtu.be/M1IDmWI2e6U, next level building man.
---
Oh wow,  ok. Do you have one or you've just seen it?
---
.......its survival mode. If you want a safe space play adventure mode.
---
Actual interaction I had while working at a Stop where you buy Games:
---
**50+ Grammy and her 8 year old Grandkid:"** *puts GTAIV on the counter.*
---
**ME: "Excuse me, I need to tell you that this game is basically rated M for everything something can be rated M for, including *lists off list* and it's not age appropriate for this child."
---
**Grammy:** "Well it's okay we'll just mute it when he plays."
---
Rocking chair should rock too
---
Just put 4 screws in each one. Problem solved
---
this post was in response to bethesda saying they heard we wanted repair kits as an atom shop item
---
I've got a slightly different take on this. Due to the reality that this game is \_frequently\_ bugged out, corpses disappear, servers drop, there should be a chest somewhere reasonably easy to get to that contains all of your loot that was not directly collected.   
---
Have a robot collect it, and have it charge a fee for any items removed from the case... 200  caps per item, say? So you don't use it to hoard gear, but you CAN use it for missed plans, legendary items, etc. 
---
Well what playstyles do you enjoy the most. Do you like melee or range? Playing with others or alone? You like to try to sneak and shoot from far or be right up in the action blasting away?
---
Whoa, sorry I meant to type "Only ever seen it at 25, never at 45" but I guess my fingers wanted to take a shortcut. Downvoting my own comment sorry
---
I like to be right up in the action
---
Also, also, I get it you know, the c.a.m.p. device doesn't make any sense realistically, but those floats are just so hard to look at.
---
Agreed. 
---
Melee or range?
---
Range
---
Yup. Just dropped a few thousand caps on mutations on the market today. So much fun. 
---
If you have log onto your computer or goto a tab in your pip boy it would be non intrusive to your gameplay.
---
The scorched are like us. Picked up too many items and didn’t know which to use or drop. 
---
So wait, my main weapon which I haven't had to fix in well over a week (and is still over 100%) is breaking faster?
---
Do tell?

They didn’t become legendary by dying in battle.

 I agree with this. lol. I don't care if they fix the lore or not. 
---
2000c
---
Keep at in man, they'll drop. If the 5% drop rate is true then doing it 55 times has a 95% chance of dropping.  (19 to the power of 55 divided by 20 to the power of 55 \* 100 gives the odds of it not happening)
---
 Some dude lower down in this thread got his first drop after 300, statistically more likely to be hit by lightening and then whilst lying twitching on the ground, hit in the balls by a meteorite (Google could not work out the odds the numbers were so large) 
---
 This of course assumes 5% is accurate, I saw 6% and could of course been very lucky. 
---
Bruce Campbell is free right now lol. 
---
I am stealth one-handed 
---
Play the game before making claims like these
---
Um...heal yes
---
Put a space between the ":" and the item. Like this.. [PS4] H: 2000 caps W: One handed Melee Weapon
---
... If they're actually 10, they shouldn't be on the game, period. 
---
i remember seeing that sale a while back
---
Any idea other than one handed what you're looking for? I have quite a few 2 and 3 star one handed weapons. Headed to bed, but if you let me know a general idea what you want I'll take a look in the morning for ya.
---
Dont carry a bunch of aid. Dont even think about logging into survival with a pve build and luxury cards. Dont get to the top 3 unless you want to pvp and be hunted.  Been lvling a toon in survival  started at lvl 21 at lvl 42 atm. I am up about 10k from pvp. If your not geared stay away from pvp hot spots where there are teams.
---
So either a shotgun build or commando. Shotgun would probably be alot more fun. You need to take all the shotgun/commando perks to max your dmg output, any relevant cripple perk cards, then because you'll be right in the fight dodge perks like serendipity to avoid dmg, as well as endurance perks to beef your dmg resistance like ironclad. And strength perks like blocker to protect from melee dmg. 
---
-very important, if you are playing alone. Take lone wanderer perk. You can get it from the beginning and it's a very powerful perk card to have if you aren't on a team.
---
Anything as long as it does good dmg
---
Never used it, always put extra stuff in the cash register next to the robot
---
What doesn't make sense to me is why there aren't weapon skins that \_already exist\_ for 4 in this game. That's easy fucking caps right there, they could do color swaps off the nukaworld handmade shit and make a mint. 
---
Morgan town airport. You have to search a bit but there’s quite a few medical/drug boxes you can loot. 
---
Maybe lag on busy servers make the weight calculations not work very good. 
---
Maybe all those weight adjustments working together creates some difficult math for the server.
---
Content isn't THAT much difference other than survival mode. On average, more stable but also more grindy. 
---
Thank you
---
This! 100% this.    When I was 5 I was playing resident evil.    I didn’t cry about zombies or whine about it being hard....I just died to the first zombie maybe 8 times and said “wow, I suck at this :/“ then went back to watching my brother playing it, got bored and left the room.    
---
So long as they can handle it it’s fine, but they gotta be able to handle it.       I could handle it in principle, but couldn’t actually play for shit, as such I was “too young”.... yet somehow didn’t have that issue with Dino crisis
---
To clarify, no, my patents didn’t get me the game,  ffs it’s resident evil.  My brother got the game, either from a store that didn’t give a damn, or  he bought it off a friend.    
---
Ah! I missed it! I was planning on joining but it completely skipped my mind. Hopefully this isn't the last time you host one of these.
---
Beef up your two handed melee perks and get a higher level super sledge. It's the highest damage weapon I have and works great even for sneaking. 
---
I’m looking for one-handed
---
&gt;However, at least they seem to be learning from their mistake and are working hard to make FO76 something great, without trying to suck additional money out of its players.
---
You may want to hold off on that. Recent activities regarding repair kits selling on the Atom store makes me think we're far from out of the woods yet. 
---
a griefer straight up *NUKED* my camp. i built a fortifed community space for newer players with water, crops, benches and beds. mind you, my camp was north of bolton greens, east of VTU. nothing noteworthy therr except the crazy cat catcher house.

Read the fine print. Accounts have to be more than a couple days old or something like that before you can post there.
---
Thank s 👍🏻
---
This statement 100%
---
Idk if all rise counts as 1 handed but that is pretty good but I'd wait until you're at least 50 to do the quest so it drops at 50
---
Uh as long as you get maybe bloody or low berserkers you should be good with many weapons 
---
Sounds like someone is trolling here. 
---
Its useless because you can just manually use one
---
I’m 135
---
The syringer is the biggest lost opportunity in the game. This thing could be a full on condition and support weapon. Burning and poison, disease, long-range stimpack application. Could have it set up well for support builds going into raids that can heal buff and apply different conditions and debuffs. There are all kinds of lost opportunities here, could apply cripples, and slows, chills, so many uses this thing could have in teams. Its sad really. 
---
Railway rifle skin plz
---
r/unexpectedskyrim
---
Either Bethesda lacks the capability of fixing it without potentially messing up something else or low priority bug. 
---
Well, least u didnt lose your stuff yay
---
I’d buy a skin for it that was just “for anchorage!” Painted on the side.  Both a white English version, or a red Chinese version 
---
Take a look at this post ! Some ppl found golden /silver handmade skins (and other stuff) in the game file.

What about.... a railway skin that just makes it look like a junk jet?
---
“ a junk jet!?!?..... railway spikes? Huh, I guess that checks out.”
---
I just personally don't see the point its quite easy to use stim manually
---
Welcome to survival. If it's not your cup of tea, there's always adventure mode. 
---
2 handed mele weapon is ALL-RISE SUPER SLEDGE rewarded from Watoga "Mayor for a day" quest. One handed mele weapons like mole miner guantlet from uranium fever event. Death claw guantlet
---
... what level are you?
---
I'm not so sure, have you checked the Atom shop?
---
Just found it, although I couldn’t get inside, couldn’t work out how to get up there (I didn’t have my jet pack pa on me) 
---
My gauss doesnt use screws :(

---
 Combat Knives. You can find legendary ones but just my Serrated Combat Knife repaired to 200% hits 150, which is devastating as you cab do that 3 times a sec ... forever. ;)
---
 My Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife at 200% is around 185 and hits so fast the Whitespring Ghoul hordes just melt. ;)
---
I'm seeing people say otherwise but on xbox if I were to go and clear out west tek my gauss would be halfway depleted I honestly dont know if this omg xbox but when I play the game acts like I dont even have gunsmith equipped
---
There was one instance where I sold a Two Shot .44 at the Sutton Station Vendor on my first account, logged in on my Survival account and was able to buy it for that character.
---
I tried again with a Two Shot Black Powder pistol and some armor but no luck.
---
I'm assuming I was insanely lucky to join the exact same server between 2 character.
---
All rise is 2 handed and LOUD! Haha, but it is a sweet weapon.
---
If your looking in game, what comes to mind is the Blade Of Bastet. You get it from the Order of Mystery quest line. Look it up, it's a multi part quest, but you get the blade about halfway through.
---
You also get a unique full body armor that provides a stealth bonus and a unique accessory item that boosts the power of the garb and blade.
---
I ran this set on my 1h stealth build till about mid 40s when I had enough good legendary things to switch.
---
The garb and blade can be upgraded too, so it grows with you.
---
Look into pvp builds, depending on what weapon you use there are very specific cards you need to stand a chance in pvp.
---
Nice I’m looking to buy
---
Well that was a waste of time. No treasure. Entry is via the roof. Used a jet pack.
---
&gt;You do realize that everyone past level 50 are basically the same level right?
---
That's basically a meaningless statement. 
---
Special count may be the same but having access to all the right perks, build tuning &amp; having good gear with all the appropriate mods (both weapons &amp; armour) happens 10's of levels later. Maybe more. 
---
It's even harder if you're not a min-maxer with mule accounts. Good luck to a solo casual being anything other than fodder. 
---
Legendary quests sound awesome! 
---
When people have spent 60+ on the game to begin with they are not begging whatsoever...
---
RIP your radium man, i hate doing similar transfers and often rope my friends in to help with the really rare stuff. Hopefully we'll get some kind of account-locked stashbox to have in our camps, it doesn't have to hold a lot, it just needs to be safe!
---
Platform? 
---
Actually a good idea yeah and yes the all rise is loud but it's the first that came to mind haha
---
Thank you PC
---
Great thanks will check it out. Always worth a punt.
---
Depends on the 3rd stat. It's common for assassins sentinel to sell for 10 to 20k depending on seller and other bidders. If the 3rd stat is ap refresh it's pretty mutch priceless, I have seen a single peice sell for 50k.
---
Lol this is absurdly naive.  No.  Devolopment costs have gone *down* over time.  Devs make more profit per $60 game sold than they ever have before.  They cut content and resell it as dlc.  This is indisputable.  That's just the way the industry works now.  
---
All the bullshit about dev costs is just the excuse AAA game companies use to justify their extremely predatory monetization schemes.  None of it is true.
---
Never mind though, the op is lvl 100+
---
3 star bloodied gauntlet, or bowie knife may sell for 3000 caps. Furious, instigating, bolstering, maybe less caps. Try to get a mele weapon with "faster swing speed"
---
I just got one shot by a guy because the berry mentats failed, I was in WS golf club cleaning up the last few ghouls and suddenly a guy turns the corner right in front of me and one shot punches me.  The mentats were finding the ghouls but not the player who was just crouching not even using a stealth boy!
---
I think crouching in general is broken for PvP, I hear you can't see the top 3 players in survival when the players are crouching...
---
It's worth it without class freak as well
---
The be honest the real question is if class freak is worth it at all
---
This reads an awful lot like a cat fishing scam.

pics of the said loot
---
I played a level 4 today until level 6 in Survival. I stayed away from the popular areas and just picked up a bit of loot as I went. I didn't get into any PVP fights which probably would have splattered me over the map. It was pretty decent for xp I guess. 
---
If you have to ask, you're not ready for survival mode. 
---
 Yeah they did good work. But the game still looks like fallout 4 or something. Compared to red dead or gow4 it looks like a joke. 
---
I want to know how the 3 star Legendary Ghoul I fought managed to totally disappear after dying. One second he's beating on me, the next I blow him away and ... vanished. Not even a pile of flies. 
---
Thank you. My keyboard didn't react and I was afraid I will have to reinstall but it was just my Dualshock 4 connected to PC
---
What's the upside? All I see is an excuse to shoot people. 
---
[https://imgur.com/4F6QGun](https://imgur.com/4F6QGun)
---
pics of loot list not sure if i did correctly
---
Because Bethesda have repeatedly said it?  Because people have run packet dumps and traces?
---
*I didn't know it was loaded!*
---
So I have to pay you 2000 for you to kill the Queen?
---
But I just server hopped today and killed her 5 times for free.
---
8 for a queen kinda overkill no?
---
Sorry, I meant, how much would you charge to paint my power armor?
---
 My main killer is the Serrated Combat Knife. A completely stock weapon with a mod. The one hand melee buffs are what you need along with Incisor and a couple other things. I don't sell stuff. I usually give it away. ;)
---
 The Nocturnal 40% rules the night and I'll keep that. I have a variety of other Legendary knives, one 3 *, but they are not all that effective compared to my SCK and my Nocturnal. 
---
A radio host could also be an in-game way of referring to new content whenever appropriate, like sightings of new creatures or hints at questlines.
---
If everyone must be dead within Appalachia, maybe they're elsewhere, remotely managing the radio station to gather information on events there and trying to provide assistance to any survivors. We could have no way of talking back, but they could be watching from a surviving satellite or drone feeds.
---
Best dps?  Dont use laser weapons.
---
So, does he have better insults?
---
I will pay 500 caps for bethesda devs to be raided
---
Lol
---
Is this for PvE Or PvP? I’ve got some instigating stuff that’ll be really good for PvE and some bloodied and AA and Assasins stuff for PvP
---
Both
---
Nvm you’re on PS4 good luck man put those spaces in between the H: and you’ll be good.
---
I'll gladly give you some
---
Confirmed found that plan here
---
Way over priced. I've been buying them for 100-200 caps for months 
---
You can also find some leather mods here, but after about 3 hours, never found deep pocketed leather or combat limbs. Pocketed leather limbs, and I think 1 deep leather chest. Mostly trapper garbage
---
I was making a ghoul run at WS tonight and saw a yellow “get the supply drop” circle.  I almost didn’t go.  I ran over and it was 2 boxes.  Had 2 lmgs in them some and other good gear.  Pretty sure there was a 1* weapon.  Never seen that.   
---
How so? I've been playing since beta. I just want advice.
---
You know thats not a bad idea.
---
Of course itd be a pain if you were overencumbered but still worth it.
---
Maybe a new item; a token to trade in for an un-learnt plan? The plan and schematic system will need an overhaul beforehand but it may be nice in future.
---
Neec to type you system in brackets so example
---
 [XB1] Then need a W. Or H example
---
W. 1 handed melee 2 or 3 star
---
H. 2000 CAPS
---
Then in the body put what perks you want or willing to accept
---
Its kinda annoying but you'll get used to it 
---
I wonder if you've played the game if you dont think they're fixing it
---
I got a couple of dueling banjos out front, yall more than welcome.
---
that workaround doesnt work for me tho ( i already made the quest but it doesnt start again), i have about 15 tech data in my stash and i cant do nothing with them :/
---
Oh gotcha! Sorry, the way this works if I learn Elder it means I'll never see it drop again, I can paint anything up Paladin for free if you are on PC- IGN Ramblingpaul
---
I have put 200 hours into the game, I like the game, and they are fixing it. But you should play the game for yourself before making statements like that. 
---
Well you all sound childish as fuck, block him and leave it as that...
---
Well you all sound childish as f, block him and leave it as that...
---
My point exactly, thank you very much 👍🏻
---
Done and done. :)
---
What you and OP are still not understanding is that its purposely a mechanic in the game. If it was a glitch and being abused to destroy others camps, then yeah fuck em. But you just cant evaluate someones personal life through how they choose to play a game. Or think yourself as a mightier gamer because others dont think like the rest of you. Its just as bad as the people who heckle 76 players for playing an incomplete and void of passion game.
---
And again, its FALLOUT. Not Minecraft, not a half life RP room, or Stardew Valley. A universe where the world is destoryed by assholes and afterwards still inhabited by them. Some people find fun in destroying shit because it just so happens to be there, and why not? In a game based around the muddled morality of man, isnt it pretty cool to have actual fill the roles of those non existent NPCs? 
---
My fav is when a creature reduces to a pile of mush in long grass in the dark.....but on the bright side you can't find it to get the infinite loading wheel..
---
Ornlu needs to get up all into this shit.

What is DDoS
---
Tooooo fucking true! Charge into the golf club after an unacceptably long time loading in and......CLICK
---
My camp is in the lake near pleasant valley train station (Not one directly opposite, the one lower down with Brahmin in it) and I've noticed him appear a couple of times on a stone overlooking my camp just watching me! Worst encounter was yesterday when I was in my house crafting and my turrets started shooting and the whole house kept moving with these large thumps. I was just about to go outside, but when I turned around a huge mothman was there in my house! Was  different to the smaller varieties that just watched me but after shooting it a couple of times I ran and it disappeared by the time I got back.
---
It doesn't matter if I agree with him or not, it's about the idea of actually doing what your making a statement about. 
---
pretty sure someone raided the container you foudn the 1\* in
---
This.
---
Nothing worse than getting prepped for something like an SBQ, pulling out your big guns and then having to reload pretty much instantly.
---
It’s only the zero star ones that do this but it does seem weird 
---
imagine getting flamed by that roaster.
---
I don't think you know what a ddos attack is...
---
What are you on about? 
---
I have legendary 1 I'll check later
---
The OP has never played the game and is making a statement about it. 
---
perhaps they could add a engineer robot that trades "duplicate" plans of his for ones he hasnt seen before and in exchange he allows you to get a plan of your choice?
---
Go to avr medical centre. Lots of aid boxes. It's one of my areas I scavenged while lower level. With pharma farma. Near charleston
---
Make that two of us. I'll follow in case more sellers arrive. 
---
[deleted]
---
Lat night I hit uranium fever twice and on both occasions 2 out of the 3 marked legendaries didn’t drop any any gear. Wondering if it was just a server glitch or whether the drop has been tweaked.
---
So? He's probably on here often, reading the patch notes and everything. And anyway why does it matter to you if he's not played the game, he has the right to an opinion. You're sounding just like my autistic little brother 
---
I was about 200 hours in before I even knew there were super mutant behemoths in this game.
---
Hell some people have never met Mothman, but I meet him too often 
---
Instead of crippling players and forcing them to work their butts off to get a repair kit, or alternatively, buying them with Atoms, why not improve the terrible durability system? I usually just trash weapons after they break, and only bother repairing/modding a weapon if it has a decent perk tied to it. Otherwise, they are totally useless.
---
I was originally undecided about these being available for Atoms, but what next? Stims? Chefs? Ammo? Junk? Yes, all can be farmed, but if someone has more money than sense (sorry, I dont consider something like this "supporting" the devs, pure cash grab) and just buys everything.... well, it takes away the whole point of a chunk of the game.
---
I'm just saying that they should play the game before they make a statement about the game, it's common fucking sense.
---
I'm desperate reddit
---
There is no complaining about game world design. It's about game play design. But they will be making it better in time. 
---
This reminds me of the fallout shelter quest. Answer correctly or... Loose! Your! Head!
---
I don't understand what your issue is, especially as he was correct 
---
Yes that is exactly what i mean. But you know that model skins exist ? Those only change the model and no stats etc
---
I think you might be progressing too fast. I ran into a couple spots like that in the early levels and would just switch to side missions.
---
Well if he's correct is subjective, but I just told you what my issue was: Don't claim something if youve never even played what your taking about. 
---
You should probably wait to do the quests honestly. Don't be in a hurry to do the quest lines. Just work on leveling up and stay up north until you reach a comfortable level. 
---
Platform?
---
I didn’t do her quests until I was around lvl 25 or 30. I’d say slow down a little and do some farming or side missions.
---
Pc
---
How do I find out what I'm up against? Shouldn't I at least have strength on my side to counter one-shot hits? Over powered characters just murder me. Levels don't matter and I want to know what does.
---
It has gotten to a point where I just go on my runs and hit my macro button that does one thing craft by spamming E at Mach 20
---
I am the rare case of being a kid that wants even less pvp restrictions atm 
---
I feel like the fact you can't one shot with high dmg low Rof guns is bad
---
Hey could I get electrically charged? Tell me when youll be on, my gt is MrProGamer888
---
That’s an alright idea actually. Maybe the fighters could both be given a revolver with 10 ammo or so and be let loose
---
As i said, he's probably watched others play, been on here and read the patch notes. After doing that you really don't need to play the game to know its improving.
---
Yup, but now they break much faster and Bethesda want you to pay money to fix them on the fly.
---
Also could you tell me when you get the speed demon serum?
---
I'm just saying you can't get a feel for the game by just reading about it, you can't capture the gameplay, the storytelling, the glitches, the feeling in the game, and to make a statement like the OP made, they should really play the game.
---
Same! I would love a Super Sledge or Handmade rifle skin.
---
As shown in the list given in the post, yes I do have charged available :) il be on In 10ish minutes 
---
Ok I'll get on 
---
The number is always the amount of fusion cores in your inventory. It's literally treating them as projectiles. 
---
Logic 
---
Bethesda, please ban squeakers.
---
That's the upside. 
---
Ok. So the next time some Scorched, Super Mutants, Feral Ghouls, Over Zealous Protecterons,Mole Rats or horde of Liberators shows up instead and actually start to really attack their camp at random, like happens in game, then who are they gonna blame then and how are they gonna handle that? 
---
I haven't played for months now, but I was about to hop back in to check out the Wild Appalachia update. Things like this just drive me away. At this rate, I may never come back and it worries me that Bethesda will somehow find a way to ruin TES6 and Starfield, as well, despite being single-player games (I assume).
---
The only reasoning I can fathom as to why Bethesda thought this was a good idea would be one (or both) of two things:
---
1. They are in serious financial trouble and pissing off a majority of players versus not milking whales was seen as the lesser of two evils.
---
2. Regardless of their finances, maybe they saw an uptick in the playerbase and player satisfaction from the recent update and the Fasnacht event, so they thought they could get away with a potential negative and earn some cash, as well.
---
Regardless of the "why", I'm going to wait another few months and give them one last chance to turn things around. Fallout and TES (more-so TES) are two of my favorite IP's ever, so all of this truly saddens me...
---
I would have equipped my MIRV'ed two shot Fatman and just stared at the kids, silently ;-) 
---
Also imagine a skin for the power armor that makes you a super mutant.
---
I'd buy every player skin they give me
---
Hello, FBI? A Fatman is a nuke, not a human male appendage. 
---
They will wait for the player base to die down a bit and then release Faction wars content to bring them all back. 
---
They'd be stupid not to. 
---
I noticed this during the Fasnacht event while server hopping.  Problem is, I don't always remember to switch to melee before logging out.  Here's to a fix soon!
---
Yes I know, and that is why I made the suggestion that I did. Things can be changed, and I think this would make people a bit more interested in trying the mode if there was some protection that you were not going to be shot by someone level 150+ with a super scoped sniper rifle from 2 miles away, tis all.
---
I don't think there's a non-legendary version.
---
9 ballistic fiber and 2 pure florescent Flux for protective. I'm going to try to farm for shielded tomorrow, which requires 11 ballistic fiber and 4 pure florescent Flux. 
---
Hopefully they wouldn't wait that long. Because I think people would get a touch upset if they did that.
---
Yup, and I'd you have a fusion core generator or two, you might even be able to power a PC fast enough to run two instances of FO76 on one PC! :D
---
The team chat and team mechanics are buggy as all get out. Something needs to be done. More than a few times my team chat will cut out and I can no longer communicate. 
---
Its true, dont get me wrong i love the game but we got issues
---
Sorry, couldn't hear the question, I was running too fast.  
---
Is it affecting melee too? My deathclaw gauntlet's going down really fast.
---
Hopefully there will be special prestige level content when they add the prestige system for high level characters.
---
I don't trade with other players just on principle, mainly as I make enough caps selling to train station vendors on a daily basis.  
---
I do understand why some players don't understand why I decline the trade request, throwing up a confused or angry emote.  
---
It's irritating when someone gives you a choice and then dislikes your given response because it's not the one they wanted!
---
I am hoarding known plans until player vending actually happens, as it's been delayed.
---
I thought you were the person I was commenting to earlier didn’t realize this was your post. The way you phrased your post is totally legitimate I was just responding to the MrFyxet guy who was wondering why his post got downvoted, it was because he didn’t ask a question at all only was shitting on Bethesda and their intentions. Sorry I didn’t read your name when I replied, everyone’s entitled to their own opinion but it has to be presented respectfully or you’ll get called out. 
---
Hey all. Thanks for the comments. I'll keep being vigilant and scour the cliffs. Might wait til I've leveled up more before heading to Whitesprings though. This has been super helpful so thank you all.
---
I want to say no. I know for a fact that when I use my instigating super sledge to xp grind at west tek it doesnt break nearly as fast.
---
It's only with rifles and from what people are saying I cant tell if it's an issue on xbox or if my game somehow has a permanent bug to where it just doesnt register my gunsmith 
---
Please 
---
Got em /s
---
I have 3 concerns.
---
 1. Is it soloable?
---
 2. Can I finish it before I disconnect? That was a big issue for me with the silo. I would always disconnect near the end of the run and not finish the silo so I hope that isn't an issue with this.
---
3. What are the worthwhile unique rewards?
---
Handmade and supersledge skins are coming.  
---
Well apparently Bethesda are going to support F76 "for years and years" so it wouldn't surprise me if they took their time with things. 
---
I’d come if your wresting a yao guai
---
I thought having the ability to choose to call down a more valuable aid drop with harder requirements to get eg: more or rarer government codes, defeating a legendary enemy that's been attracted by the smoke and noise of the drop, beating other player to the rare goodies or holding off a wave or two of hard enemies before it unlocks.  Just a couple thoughts on how to make them more useful or interesting to bother with after low levels. More valuable crafting resources would also be a nice touch if they didn't want to bother too much with the aid drops atm.
---
Dude, "expected sales" don't mean jack when we're talking about EA. Google how many copies they actually sold and how many were "expected". They'd had unrealistic expectations from the start, simple as that. Both games still sold millions of copies, which can only be considered bad in EA's or Activision's world. So yeah, the guy's 100% right. If you generate enough hype or if the brand is undamaged and recognizable enough, the quality of your game doesn't matter at all. We've seen it with FO76 and we see it with Anthem now (that one mostly got its millions from Bioware's name).
---
Good thing you can buy repair kits now hey
---
When I restarted the game, I was at the Glassed Cavern.  All previous transducers had reset and no Taggerdy at the end of the line.
---
Recently started whittling! Pretty great way to spend a few hours relaxing and thinking. 10/10 would recommend
---
I refuse
---
Good. Fuck Bethesda and this bullshit
---
I don't think the Atom shop is a bad thing and don't see it any different then paying for DLC content like I have in other games. I like that the Atom shop has a variety of things that appeal to different people. I for one love to decorate and build my C.A.M.P and have moved 6 times so far in this game, rebuilding each time @ 4+hrs each time. I did the same thing in FO4...I have replayed that game 6 times, making changes to my settlements and game play each time. Others who like weapons and armor can buy what they want and those who like to interact with people make use of the emotes/poses, etc.

I remember getting my first Nintendo in 1985 when I was 7 and the games were just what came with the cartridge. Nothing more, nothing less. As games and the systems expanded they got more involved and the expansion of the Internet allowed various game developers to add things to games after they will developed or to appease players. Nothing wrong with that. Hell I can't think of anything that doesn't offer "add-ons" from my cable to streaming video service to the mechanic when I go in and so on...so I don't really see how this is different or bad?
---
After this amazingly helpful wall of text for really anyone, all I have to say is; since the first fallout game I played it's always been weight to value for me, cig cartons in fo3 were great cap to weight value.
---
We shall see won't we.. We shall see.
---
In Fallout 4, at the end I obsessively collected PA until I had up to 30 of them. Madness. In FO76 I have three and it's one too many. The mighty Excavator, the Ultracite and the X-01. On the rare occasions when I am in PA, 99% of the time it's in the Excavator, 1% the X-01 (it has a jet pack) and I never use the Ultracite. But I mean, how could I throw that out, right?  Cool looking paints might be the only reason I'd look for a T-series again.
---
I believe it's Lady Janet's Soft Serve in the northwestern part of the map almost straight north of vault 76, near the little turkey on the map.
---
Not really, T-60 was stated in Fallout 4 to be deployed right after Anchorage.  To be honest it would have been better if they had made it a Brotherhood of Steel unique armor as it would have made them a bit more imposing and also would have all around made more sense.
---
X-01 is just a case of Bethesda putting their "super OP" enclave armor into everything and anything they can.  It's actually pretty amazing it didn't make a "surprise" appearance in Far Harbor too.  It's also pretty difficult to say it couldn't be feasibly produced since apparently the Army was handing it out like candy even so one soda company could one up the other.
---
this,wtf is a kid doing on a game about the disasters of the wasteland like slavery murder rape prostitution etc 
---
But I cannot wait to destroy Enclave and Raider scum with my Brothers of Steel! 
---
I suppose we can work with the Responders... 😉
---
You took way too many chems... that’s a machete not an axe so obviously you will loot an axe.
---
&gt;How dumb are these parents letting their young kids play an online game like this??
---
because its easier to buy the kid a console or a pc and give them  a game to play than be a parent and do stuff with their kid 
---
Apparently some new "cool" looking paints are going to be added (No idea when). I'm trying to go away from the Excavator armor via my calibrated shocks in my T-60. I've always liked the look of the T-60 so it's my main set. So far what I've found is that paints are restricted to certain sets of PA. Which is kinda sad, but it's w/e. Having 7 sets of PA isn't too much of a deal since each one only weighs 2.5 LBS. Plus, I have a crap ton of weight reducing perks. 
---
So yeah, let's hope they add in some new dope skins. Maybe even some new PA if they can make it lore friendly.
---
I see that all the time 😂 Shoots me with a shotgun, drops a lead pipe 
---
weapons are breaking too fast and the enemies are super spongy welcome to craftammo76 with a side dish of repairs
---
enjoy
---
This is the answer. It has no animation and doesn't require you to be unstaggered. 
---
"Food spoilage, what's that?" [eats corpse]
---
Then someone else’s had there camp there 
---
Have you sent in a ticket yet? You should probably mention what system you are on and what perk cards you're using. Seems like others aren't having the same issue you are.
---
Yes but the amount of repairs I have to do with my rifles is asinine. The amount I have t ok repair to maintain was nowhere near this amount before the survival update
---
wooow,TIL
---
I'm seeing that now and I'm hoping it isnt Beth doing an underhanded marketing trick to get us to buy their repair kits.
---
I will send them a ticket when I have time thanks.
---
I don’t understand how a game can have such a broken end-game event. It’s been bugged since beta. 
---
You have to find technical data and once you find one you go through the quest and at the end it could possibly give you one has a reward
---
I got the BOS one from turning in technical data. 
---
There's your problem "contribute money to help the game development".
---
Microtransactions and digital currency aren't funding game development. By buying these things you're contributing to negative aspects of the game industry. Buying these things doesn't guarantee a sequel, it doesn't guarantee jobs for developers (look at the Activision and EA layoffs, despite record profits).
---
All it does is guarantee the next game they shit out will have more and more of this shit.
---
It's not new but sometimes they don't drop anything, where I have my camp now an enemy turret is placed( I built in an existing structure) the turrets load in before people so I built two turrets facing it.
---
Every time a new player goes near my camp or I login / logout that turret respawns and gets shredded by my turrets, its been great for 5.56 ammo ill tell you what.
---
I saw someone selling one for 35K in case you're wondering how much it's worth
---
Fine are fusion cores. Always seen to be empty when i equip.the weapon
---
 so dang annoying.
---
I have 8 waiting for vending 🤷‍♂️
---
Back in time multiplayer games had a mensual subscription. Now they have *optional* microtransactions. Games cost a lot to develop, and a lot more if they are multiplayer and have updates every few weeks.
---
Not saying that you should trust Bethesda outright, but it seems unlikely they are connected. Bethesda games are just kind of buggy in general. While some underhanded tactic isn't impossible, its not likely. 
---
And this is why we have crappy games and microtransactions. Kids don't want new bikes for christmas anymore, they want games and microtransactions
---
This has been happening to me since I started the game, every gun has about 10/20% ammo. Infuriating when it’s a Gatling laser and you reload it ready for use then it’s back to basically zero when you need it. There are so many tiny in game QoL problems that just piss me off and make the game hard work.
---
uh! uh! ... Fire Breather Thank-you. 
---
That was my initial thought.  Before there was even word of the repair kits I noticed my rifles were breaking faster except for my heavy weapons. 
---
I simply thought that when Beth adjusted the heavy weapons durability they somehow switched the numbers on rifles too, making them just as fragile as the heavy weapons used to be
---
At least legendary items.
---
clever :P but hey, then ..I guess I learned something new today too. Thanks for the reply (Y)
---
Leader of the Pack is so easy, I just go in with my Deathclaw gauntlet and don't bother wasting ammo.  
---
Easy XP and a stack of meat to cook off, it's all good in my opinion, but I do agree, the Legendary drop is useless.
---
Hey that's what life is all about, learnin' new things.
---
+1
---
No that’s lame. 
---
Pump-action shotguns. OMG.
---
They actually got back to me and changed my name!
---
No ive seen that map and use it regularly, i wanna know if theres a mao similar that shows where the little rocky outcrops are on the side of cliffs and stuff
---
Just gotta get that black cowboy hat and you're set.
---
I told a guy i have naked pics of his gf. Then i sold them to him. Good trade 
---
Also don't have any mutations that put off damage when attacked.  
---
Some users will melee until it sparks. The game considers this a retaliatory action, allowing the person to freely kill you.
---
I believe the fix to that is to keep pacifist on, though.
---
Id rather them delay sometbing and get it working properly as opposed ro release it unready and buggy
---
I thought i was on Behaviour forums for a second
---
If you are on ps4 u/quitjoshin can help you his psn is josh87r.
---
Heh, I was there just yesterday, but I didn’t find any notes. 
---
Radiation or goop, I want those bottles for my CAMP. 
---
I don't agree that FO76 or any Fallout game should be an 18 or M rated game, maybe 16.  
---
Don't treat the kids bad for playing a game above their age, some kids are pretty mature for their age, but then again some parents don't care enough about what their children play.  
---
Each to their own I always say, age is in no way a definition of how mature or immature a person may be, note I said a person, not a child, some so-called adults are very immature, especially in online gaming.
---
I...I'm twenty-six and I get very scared playing horror games. When I grow up I want to be able to play them without having anxiety when I gotta get up to pee in the middle of the night.
---
And also a pony.
---
Yeah, there are very few players that are still playing survival mode that's why you end up with same players in the same server.
---
That mode is just broken and unbalanced and they need to fix if they want players going into survival, lol even double XP didn't help in getting more players.
---
A workaround for your question is to check someone in your  server and block him from session. This will force auto matching to find a different server.
---
Maybe there should be a third mode. 
---
Adventure
---
Survival
---
U FUCKEN DRUGGOS
---
Yep I'd even pay to see that
---
The beatings will continue until morale improves.
---
Your brain is broken
---
Pro-Tracktron. 
---
Any news on what vending is going to look like? Literally a vending machine where you set the price of caps and other players come to your camp to buy? 
---
I'm surprised you hadn't thought to make a report before now. That is a pretty bad bug if you are using a rifle-based build. Hope it gets fixed for you soon.
---
Yeah but I doubt you whine to a parent about it.
---
I'm not a very smart person
---
Gets me killed in pvp after respawn sometimes
---
More crazy religious nuts to exterminate, spreading their faith, sorry I should have said radiation, just Freudian slip of the tongue.
---
"It's a feature" - Todd Howard 
---
&gt;  the whole server 
---
Are we sure about this part? On another thread i was saying that i tried to help down her on my first and only queen event, and everyone got mad at me because i'm too low level and don't have right build, saying that the event sould be made so only people who have finished the main quest line should be able to participate.
---
So my impression was that i won't even care about that event from now on, because anyway, i'm just a filthy casual that only has interest in exploring, looting and building.
---
They should add plasma core launchers
---
A fight club where higher level players pay lower level players to brawl it out in an unarmed fight ( or boxing gloves). Make sure to have a large camp with a dimly lit basement. And if course have someone giving away drinks
---
I love this idea but hate the 'We were entitled to this from the beginning' attitude. 
---
The game was already a hot mess at launch. We didn't need more features at the start, this game is all about evolving as it grows (hopefully not into a money grubbing shit show.)
---
Have I got news for you, Buck-o! Nah haha how fucked up would that be, middle of the night my dad's phone rings:
---
Dad: hello?
---
Me: h-hey dad, is mom awake?
---
Dad: *sighing It's your son, he wants to talk to you. 
---
Mom in the background: it's 2 in the morning! Has he been playing that stupid Nintendo game again?!
---
Me: no...I just uh.... Miss you guys.
---
Mom in the background again: just beep and act like it was a joke answering machine and hang up. I told you, you should have worn a god damned condom. 
---
You made me chuckle take an upvote.
---
And honestly if it was 2am I would only call my parents to help me hide a body....
---
Yes it was. Very well done. 
---
Are you talking about the supply crate we get from using a radio tower or something else?
---
Almost each time i use a req holo, someone steal the content from me.
---
church in point pleasant has lots of chems, also worth cooking the mothman eggs there since the omelettes sell for good caps 
---
I don't think I'd have to balls to call my parents that early for that. Pretty sure if I did the next time I'd visit my dad would be waiting outside with a toaster like a makeshift flail. 
---
It’s not in the game. It’s just a showcase of new and future camp additions. 
---
3 one stars and then not even legendary, I’ll try again if I see it 
---
Bethseda - we got you fam .. For only 1000atoms
---
It’s still there.  I hit it up last night.
---
That one, the one next to the bed inside, and the doctors bag.  I hit all three when I fast travel there for vendoring. 
---
Also hit up four aid spots by the gym before then.  One by the pool, one at the stairway up, and two (aid box and mirror) in the hotel room bathroom.  
---
Dont try to kill SBQ in survival without god roll weapons to kill all the other players. Survival is only for you if you have 1 or 2 friends and really good gear.
---
Perhaps you aren't the one to be hosting something if you aren't able to come up with an idea of something to host? Why should you benefit from the creativity of someone else? 
---
Buying, selling, questions?
---
Get god roll gear and one hit kill them back, or keep dying repeatedly like me. Just quit when there is no more double exp and leave the shitty game mode to die
---
Cool. Im on xbox. whats your gt. mine is Deviant Monster. I don't need you to give me stuff, (I wouldn't turn it down either) , but I would keep my eye out for you on servers so that I could maybe see someone wearing a rare mask. 
---
I don't play on console so I couldn't seen console players.
---
When you said hidden door I thought you meant the one on the 3rd floor of the resort inside with the wall that opens up. My omg factor was this close to being over 100%
---
That would be funny
---
i Juggxrnaut i
---
I'm on now :3
---
Gotta get a META weapon and assassin gear, preferably also get a friend with the same and then you rule survival mode. Good game mode
---
At what point in planning this did you say to yourself "better pack the gas mask and go to all these public places and government buildings"? Did anyone hassle you for that, or am I totally overthinking this? 
---
Yeh ok I’ve heard people talking about those. Where would be a good place to do that tho
---
Yeah its bullshit. Deffo a bug
---
Gatling lasers are fast, very fast, the mod you will need to get to do SBQ's and others are the beam focuser....
---
After the "energy" patch this weapon is great, and really fun to use :)
---
It's a great idea but with the atom shop adding repairs for atoms, and the early access for ES: Blades, I feel like Bethesda will likely add resources available for microtransactions as they don't seem to care about reputation anymore. 
---
Cool. I can't get on now. but I'll keep an eye out in the future. cheers!
---
It’s not so much I can’t think of what to do I just wanna know what people would enjoy and want to take part in.
---
I’m an old coot - turned 47 today in fact 
---
I grew up playing games.  I also grew up during the time when ratings were assigned to music and games (among other things). 
---
I personally never understood mature ratings for music - as who didn’t hear people say fuck or shit as a kid?  But games- particularly violent game - are a bit different. 
---
I’m a parent of two girls - 13 and 11.  They aren’t really into gaming but if they were I wouldn’t let them play an M rated game. 
---
In a game where mankind nuked the earth into near oblivion and rads are everywhere, we're worried about plastic.  Hmmm, okay then. 
---
This goes hand in hand for my request for sandbags as a camp item. 
---
That’s my interpretation based on what little they have revealed 
---
Trivia, boxing matches, some kind of competitions?
---
I'm 42 and a half. I don't have issue with shop in game anymore, but i had it in the past. I got used to it  but i still prefer when things are more on the cosmetic side in multiplayer games.
---
It’s not about repair kits it’s about anything what you buy with real money to progress in a game quicker more will come, this a tester 
---
I can craft you one. But not legendary. 
---
The junk jet is actually in the game apparently, just very rare.
---
I’m hoping you set prices on yours in your camp and they then see it on their own vendor in their own camp, if they buy it it just pops out.  Then we don’t have to reveal our camps or live in popular locations.  
---
Ok
---
Psn: Misterfruit88 
---
I mean, i think heafsshots should be 1 shot kill in PvP but as someone who is 100% on the receiving side of these 1 hit wonder weapons theyre boring as fuck so i dont PvP with those people
---
Sent u an invite
---
&gt;shielded
---
Census violence drops  shielded , got it last night :)
---
Good idea thx man
---
And then 76 re-retconned it as a post-war design (Enclave terminal)
---
It's 100% worth it even without CF3. The difference between having/not having Speed Demon (and Marsupial for that matter) is night and day.
---
I leveled up a mule character to get the various weight perks and the first 30ish levels until Starched Genes was agonizing. I felt actively hindered, coming off my main that has had both for months now.
---
I was there yesterday and had to fight 6 of them all by myself! Luckily I play a sniper character so I picked them off from the rooftops with relative ease, was a crazy sight to see though!
---
It's a super rare spawn, but the only time I've seen him spawn in the same place twice was outside pricket's fort.
---
Take the road north from the Philipi cemetary, and as you approach the fort on the right hand side where the rock formations start to pull away from the road. Right there.
---
What platform?
---
There is ne thing i Don't Believe at all in all this is when they clim the repair kit was " Something *alot of people* i've requested" . 
---
I am more than curious to see an actual census on how many people requested this, because i have not once saw someone request for them. 
---
This just looks like a blatant lie to justify breaking a promess.
---
If your bored on xbox you could make me some lvl 30 armor and a gun or two that would make my life easier. I only get on for like 3 hours a week.and it makes progression pretty slow and impossible, especially when I haven't seen a single legendary hun or armor piece I can use in 170 hours of playing. 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
I think you get kicked from the server because the whole server crashes, meaning there's nothing to return to. 
---
You can always try going to you social menu and joining your ecent players, that's worked for me when the Xbox freezes.
---
but what about my anti-US circle-jerk?
---
Swords are your best bet.
---
Have an upvote, squeakers are what they are good lord - especially when they get worked up.
---
There's going to be a "legendary corpse finder" mod for your power armour helmet. You'll be able to buy it from the atom store.
---
I usually play solo. But every time i launch, i try to get on a team with at least 1 other person before i do, for exactly this reason
---
I wish there was no crosshairs at all. Time to ‘get gud’.
---
I've died so many times because of that lol
---
Ha! Seriously tho....its a heavy weapon....aside from a few of them, ur shooting everywhere
---
Or wield a minigun like a melee weapon and then drop a pump shotgun
---
From what I've seen said your camp can be set to appear on the map as a player vender.
---
There are several plausible explanations for T-60 floating around, but i just wanted to say that X-01 and Advanced Power Armor that Enclave used are not the same.
---
It’s not that the devs aren’t doing exactly what hundreds of individuals each specifically want.  It’s that they’re directly contradicting what they said since basically day one: the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic only.
---
Flipping on how the game treats micro transactions - as a way to better express or visually entertain the players, vs. a means to items that have a direct effect on game mechanics - can affect the game on a fundamental level.  Not one mere repair kit, mind you: the choice of allowing the repair kit, or the ammo buff, or the xp boosts, or the latest elite weapons or characters/classes is what changes what kind of game we are playing.  And to do that after the release and sale of a game is a pretty shady thing to do.
---
TLDR: my real critique and stated case that switching to micro transactions affecting game mechanics is bad.
---
Assassine sentinal anything
---
Inactive ❓
---
Ugh it's just so frustrating
---
There is a door and stairs shown in the beginning of the video. 
---
Thank You. 
---
We could go even farther and get rid of Survival Mode that seperates the Community, and open up Factions for Players and make em more impactful to Pvp Situatons. That means everyone in a faction can shoot other People in Enemy Factions. It's in the Peoples Hand if they want to join some Raiders and go into a Open Pvp Experience or just joining some Trader Packs to peacefully trade with each other. Heck exactly like every other Fallout Game works somehow xD
---
The stealth meter getting jammed on danger when there's nothing around is always fun. The worst for me is the quick swap resetting to fists even though I never use fists. I wish they'd kept the arrow shortcuts from Fallout 4, I'm so clumsy at wheels.
---
I have like 50+ duplicate plans stored plan to put them in player vending machine when they arrive next week, maybe someone else will need them.
---
I build in the one leg then only above so creatures have less to attack and most times there is little to no damage to the base. 
---
On pc a 1000000 caps or a anti armor or bloodied item, on consol probably 5000 caps, seems pc users have lost the ability to trade with caps, im sitting with 50000+ caps and nothing to buy
---
Survival sucks. If you dont have the gear and the min maxed build to compete you either need a team or adventure mode. Sad facts
---
No. It's always possible that they're top secret, but I've never heard rumors of any in the area.
---
Nope. Don't have that. 
---
Worth it.
---
This is a good point, although I didn't mind subscription based games. If they kept the game worth it, I'd keep subscribing.
---
yeah the way you worded it was as a skin for only the combat armor i was referring to making it a cosmetic layer item like most outfits in the game sans the under armors like the vault suit
---
Not having to worry about overencumberance or loosing certain aid items wouldn’t change how someone plays??
---
Lmao this guy is sooooooo right 
---
I have played 300+ hours and not once did I say, wow I need to buy repair pack to fix weapon. Weapon workstations are all over place and in your camp, just carry a back up weapon. People are making a mountain out if a mole hill with this repair packs. If you release lootboxes with high tier weapon then I will have an issue.
---
I think the problem with the FO4 version was that it wasn't an online lobby.  The cameras put you in two places at once and the game wasn't designed to have more than one player.
---
No one should have to have a phd in fallout 76 mechanics and builds to find a level of success. The amount of min maxing and the fact that you either need 300k caps or insane luck to have a viable build is gonna limit the player base after a while. 
---
I agree. If it weren't for the fact that I have a shit ton of ammo. I wouldn't hit a thing with my 3* gatling gun
---
Getting a prized weapon or armor piece back into working condition mid-battle (pvp or otherwise) doesn’t affect a competitive part of the game?
---
was there last night, most of them charged at me  and the boss tried to run away 
---
I'm sorry to say that i'm not really into that sort of content in any games i play because i'm just a filthy casual that prefer to just explore, loot and build, but also because i have zero friends that play games.
---
Even if there's a matchmaking, because usually the group would ask me to plug a mic, or at least to listen to their voice and i don't like having people yelling in my ears.
---
Also, if it's like any other games i played in the past, i would get excluded from group and removed from the instanced area if they think i'm not using a good build or any other reason.
---
I prefer how it was in Monster Hunter World where i could send a flare and the people would choose to join me if they want to help.
---
This sure would be nice. I attended a nuke at prime the other day, finished off the SBQ and before I could loot, the server stopped. Tried to get back in but no luck. Did all that work, spent caps to get there, used stimpaks and radaway like crazy, all for nothing. When I finally got on another server it dropped into one that had scorchbeasts out (dude was shooting fissure like an idiot) and I almost died. Finally made it to watoga. Had hoped this was a one time issue but all day that day the servers were having issues. Checked my comp and it's capabilities and the problem wasn't there. But yep, please make looting the SBQ and such an automatic thing.
---
To stow a weapon:
---
Unloaded
---
Bolt forward
---
Safety on fire
---
Uncocked
---
Yep, had this happen every time I died in a SBQ fight.  I'd respawn with "6" loaded.
---
Yeah, the jet pack kind of stands out on my camo suit.
---
Those were only skins for existing generators, dude.  And you still had to know the plans to build em - no freebies there.
---
How do you have that many caps?  I thought the limit was 25000?
---
You agree that you don't have the game related knowledge yet yoy continue to pursue validity of completwly invalid thesis. The items that define the god-tier PvP builds are dirt-cheap and commonly neglected. The only think you need to dominate is good knowledge and a well organised team. I'm keen on sharing details on how to git gud but only to players that don't think they are experts when in reality they know shit.
---
No one wants your fallout 76 lessons dude. Go teach someone who gives a fuck. Survival is trash you arent gonna convince me otherwise even with your 1000 hours in game.
---
To store a weapon it must be
---
Safety set to fire
---
On Bethesda game day panel last week Tod said will trade existing legendaries to earn point. So I have personally been keeping every 2+ legendary I find, still a month away so stockpiling and storing in inventory is an issue in itself
---
Not really. If anything it might get you boned in a pvp setting. Think about it. Sure you might be able to hotbar the repair kit. But you have to select what you are repairing. Meaning menu time. 
---
Too bad it won’t be next week now.  Postponed until May. 
---
SBQ lands and I have to reload the Damn gatling laser every time
---
Also, maybe the repair kit is essentially just a portable workbench type thing. Only gives you the option to repair but you still need materials? Do we really know what it is yet?
---
Not sure about The Barrows but Patch 8 is this Tuesday, 9th of April. I’d assume this Barrows is a place revolving around the Lying Lowe quest
---
(Quick theory, the quest title gives me the impression that Lowe could be a con artist in some way)
---
I had a 3 star legendary drop a drill yesterday. A plain one. I'd almost rather have lost the body lol
---
The correct response would have been to simply exit the game immediately. To his eyes the camp would have disappeared.
---
Most of them I wouldn't sell over 300 caps. Look the Assassin Flamer, first effect gives you what, 10-20% dmg to Players, It alone gets beaten by TS or Explosive, that does same or more in all situations. And most of them have "Vats" and "none vats" effect- you can use Vampire in Vats and nonVats, but if you are nonVats, your most of the effects are useless. 6th weapon would be the best in this list, if you can actually use it in VATS, but as I don't use VATS, chances are you can't even shoot it without running out VATS asap.
---
And have a level 220 snipe me from the other side of the map with 100% hit chance? No thanks. 
---
It's balancing really.
---
Doh!
---
If consider myself a younger player (15) and I agree that if you aren't ready for online interactions, you shouldn't be playing.
---
Man the hell are these Devs Thinking, i was hoping with some and roadmaps fallout 76 ciuld bounce back. Adding gameplay items centered around cash shop systems HELL NO! Im not standing for this. Nope not one bit,    
---
Its ok Timmy, you can play, just don't aim for the head in vats!
---
So having your weapon working again in a few seconds is worse than your weapon not working?
---
Eating a deathclaw steak from your pip-boy mid battle might get you killed, but it doesn’t mean the steak doesn’t give you a nice boost!

The real question is what is enough? Lol If I were to guess, I would have to think I was in the 115-125 data range myself. Most of those recieved being ammo/aid drops. The one that really surprised me was a BOS Sheilded Lining Plan from last night. I didnt even think you got those from the technical data drops so they muct be on the level of getting a paint plan. So as for plans I got, itd be the lining and two BOS Initiate Paint. The initiate plans being over a month and half ago when you were able to get them still. Wish I hung onto the paint duplicate since that be worth quite a few caps now. Other than that, its always ammo/aid or apparel and a random ammo or aid item. 
---
But you don't become a legend for running away from every battle either. Untill you're a legendary coward.
---
The game is more stable. Only big additions were alcohol crafting and survival mode. 
---
They have tweaked some.mechanics, some for better some for worse. 
---
As for what is expected in the future of the game I would suggest you read the Inside the vault articles. And check out the roadmap.
---
Dungeons, more events, possibly NPCs and Factions are among some things on the agenda. 
---
Not sure what other info to give you that you cant find after a few minutes of online reading. 
---
Watching them kill a tabby cat in the wild changed that mentality for me. All wolves will burn.
---
I see what youre saying. But i keep food hotkeyed. No menu tome. If your weapon breakss it is smarter to run than open the menu. Or switch guns and repair up after the fight.
---
I _really_ doubt it’s a portable workbench, since they called it a repair kit and not, say, single-use personal ED-E companion.  Or “portable repair station.”
---
Patents should monitor what their kids are playing, so the kids gaming experience doesn't end up being upsetting for them because they're way over their heads in a game surrounded by grown ups
---
Hard to tell, at this point, really. Personally think the idea is fine, it should still cost mats. Guess we will see
---
It always mutates me too.
---
Didn't think about messages but you're right. Sad thing is if you played eso the first few years it was out, you'd see what I'm talking about smh
---
I want the red gun from Fort Defiance in my camp.
---
Yeah I know it's not an official location but I wonder where it was built , cus I wanna build mine there.
---
I’m not trying to get bogged down in the details of more efficient ways to buff in PvP.  I’m saying “main weapon can work” &gt; “main weapon cannot work”, and Atom Shop repair kits can achieve that.  That makes them an item that directly affects game mechanics and gameplay.
---
Do you feel I’m wrong in any of those assertions?
---
Near the whitespring gate west of the bunker entrance is like a 10% spawn rate. Or just wander the savage divide.
---
We really need this as a feature. It is also annoying when you claim a workshop and spend resources only to get disconnected.
---
Even some better emotes would help, when ever I’m trying to communicate something, the point never gets accross
---
I don’t really feel that you’re right or wrong. As it stands right now, we just see “repair kit”. Some people (you) disagree with the idea. Some people (me) don’t really mind it. 
---
I’m willing to keep my mind open to it until I get more specific details on what exactly it is and how it functions.
---
What’s this quick swap and secondary weapon people are mentioning — is that something different than the favorites wheel?
---
If you also want the floods monster, go far east in the mire, the only place I've found him.
---
There was a mod for text chat but unfortunately the last large dlc drop/update completely broke the mod and the creators haven't been able to fix it.
---
Sometimes but not always but yeah make sure to atleast remember 1 persons name so you can join thru your recents 
---
In my experience Thunder Mountain has one room with about 6 cabinets in it that I believe is marked as security, I wasn't able to find the usual cabinets in Poseidon, but that plant has some extra areas I haven't spent much time digging around in.
---
Monongah isn't too bad despite the fast travel point. Run straight up, enter through the turbine hall, go up the first ramp on the right and you're basically in front of the control room with it's dozen cabinets.
---
Im on PS4. I use a sniper, a handmade, and an auto pipe rifle. Played about 5hrs Sat, and noticed no dif. I havent repaired a gun in over a week. So unless it just started, its not an issue on PS.
---
They literally say that it takes no materials to repair an item when using a repair kit.  So no.
---
The vault Tec one just went out of stock in the atom shop. When you complete the BoS questlines, you can turn in data to get one.
---
Especially when you have literally just begun a quest, and boom disconnected! FFS.
---
So a plasma'esque Fatman?
---
Haha I love these requests without posting their system. Cracks me up how often it happens. 
---
Not only is it just another logo but it doesn't match the other officer ranks which is even stranger.
---
If there wasn't a pvp mechanic maybe.  But in online mmo where were about to get dungeons, there has to be some kind of balancing otherwise why would anyone play with anyone ever if you can just solo things by yourself.  
---
If this was a single player title yes give me all of the points, but online?
---
There has to be a limit, no matter how painful it may seem
---
That's part of my daily loot run, and that place can always be challenging, no matter my level.
---
I'm not trying to convince you as I already determined you are not candidate for high-class PvP. Survival is not for whiny kids and you won't enjoy it as it requires thinking, an activity you don't seem to favor.
---
I literally have dozens of people listening to my lessons. I'm jumping through various discords giving them, looking for most capable people there to suck em into my gang. In the last one admin has made a channel "the theory of violence" for me and my listeners. I have 7 candidates for our international section and I don't have the time to train all them, but one of those who I trained now earn caps from survival using crafted combat rifle. I loled hard when I learned that and gave him a proper gun. He doesn't use it because he's too lazy to get new ammo xD
---
My personal greatest trouble with survival is that I have to move 400lbs of aid and junk out of my main PvP character daily, to manage the profits I earn from survival mode. I enter stations contested by a group alone and push the group out.
---
Oh and I do all that while letting my enemies shoot the first bullet, I don't KoS people on sight, I don't have to, I'm only interested in defeating those who tried to hunt me down. I'm requiring my listeners not to shoot people who just spawned nor those who waved a hello emote. Spreading the competetive and friendly atmosphere.
---
“So long as you have a Repair Kit in your inventory, you can use it to fix up a piece of gear anytime, anywhere, and without spending any of your own crafting materials. Once you’ve got a Repair Kit, open your Pip-boy to find an item you want to repair, hit “Inspect”, select the new “Repair Kit” option, and then leap right back into the action”
---
It’s all right there in Inside the Vault.
---
HALO 2!!!
---
I posted this in the Bethesda Fallout forum and the first comment was how all “girls” were actually guys pretending to be. 🙄
---
I’ll add you! 
---
Yeah. Left on the D-Pad swaps to your last used weapon.
---
You can only buy them. From the vendor in the whitrsprings bunker. Good luck! 🤦
---
Oh so console only probably thanks 
---
I get that. This is the first online game I’ve played since ESO. Normally just do single player games. 
---
I don't know if there's plans, but the mods used to be available at  one of the Enclave vendors. 
---
Ew?
---
In the armory of the enclave? I'm there now and wanted to buy the plans but can't seem to find them 
---
Okay. Thanks for the info, hadn’t seen that.
---
Still on the side of accepting them. Do we know if it is one time use? “So long as you have a repair kit” 
---
Sounds consumeable, which IMO is more acceptable than a permanent item that repairs everything for free. 
---
It’s not a gamebreaking item. Almost guarantee some people will buy them and trade them for other things given the “atom” value (if they arent “soulbound”) 
---
There’s a potential for it to actually help game economy by giving things “value”
---
I’m atleast willing to see how it goes.
---
I lucked out and the first day I tried hopping I got two holotape game magazines in a row. 
---
Haven’t had anymore games though since.  And I have yet to find grahm who is my main goal.  Though I had responder vendor bot 3 times. 
---
Usually just a horde of random enemies though.  
---
No the real problem is one using a gatling laser as a melee weapon then dropping a combat knife 
---
I always end up swinging at a super mutant with my fist instead of with my black diamond lol. 
---
Just saw that you could only buy the mods. Guess I'll be going with the T-60 then
---
It's instanced, so if they're not there. You'll have to keep server hopping........... A lot. They will turn up eventually.
---
Right now there is no combat advantage between level 70 (enough to get to perfect build + must have QoL perks like weapon artisan) and level 500. The level 500 guy has a wider variety of roles they might build their character into, but only having onle role at a given time makes it so that PvP encounters between level 60 and level 300 don't have obvious conclusions. Due to other factors, i.e. ridiculous amount of caps you loose on PvP death if you are high level, most dedicated PvPers already run with alt characters under level 80.
---
Your flairs go perfectly with the question and response
---
I use a controller on PC.
---
Server hop near Charleston station over and over, kill the grafton monster, as he drops 20 caps each time, and maybe look for the vendor bot.
---
Thank you for your input. 
---
More like a fatman with bouncy plasma mini nukes
---
I think that your idea about the "collector bot" or something to that effect is golden especially the fee part although I think 200 caps per withdrawal is STEEP.
---
 You should make this suggestion into its own post bcuz I think you'll get lots of likes
---
You should always swing your PS4 with both hands.
---
Well that sucks then. 
---
Happy birthday.  
---
It is a big deal because they will inevitably have your gear break faster to push people to buy kits.  This will be incremental but it will happen.
---
I use lever action and handmade on my rifle build.  But in reality it will end up being which ever one you find your best legendary versions for.  
---
Before level 50, always go for the highest level version.  Once you get to level 50 focus on those legendary versions. 
---
I got a fucking vampires grenade launcher with better bash damage and faster movement while aiming. Its also level 25 for some reason.
---
Crashing is one of the most important features of this game since beginning. They are not going to fix it. It adds random fun to the game encounters.
---
This and the "missing required ammo" nonsense bug me. I'm carrying a ton of fusion cores. Don't play this game with me Gatling Laser.
---
Because guys what? I'm currently taking a break from Fo76 , I played a free offer for ESO and now I can't put it down. Seems like there's a lot of girls on ESO compared to Fo76. Unless they're just guys with girl avators. I noticed in Fo76 there was a lot of guys dressed up as girls, I'm not sure why that is. 
---
Nice, looks like your having quite the adventure, I always try and take a memorable photo at almost anything I think is photo worthy
---
"Enclave" 👀
---
I’m a very casual player at level 26 (stopped in December and just started playing again this week)
---
The defend workshop events picked me up 7 stimpaks in about an hour and only needed to be there for when the waves attacked and could stuff around doing other stuff in between. 
---
Plus if you stack up the workshop with turrets and do the floating builds places like hemlock holes gets you pretty easy XP with higher level enemies 
---
Could be a slow way of doing it 
---
Yes! Totally agree with you. As a Heavy Gunner myself, using the Gattling Gun and the Iron Sight is absolutely pointing.. If we could have the Gunner Sight from the Minigun, I'd be a happy heavy!
---
Or better yet, fixed the angled sight on the Gattling Gun.. Bethsda. Please!
---
There are reasons why they don't want us to have that option. Obviously duping,unloading in a container then logging back onto to that server to go str8 to that container to grab the 100s of whatever we/they put there is a problem to this day
---
This is what I'm wondering. If it's a one-time purchase with Atoms, and that purchase gets you a blueprint for Repair Kits, and you have to craft those Repair Kits with materials at a workbench then that doesn't seem nearly as bad to me.
---
Would love to. Im level 32 but I'd be willing to join to have folks to play with. GT: Sarah Oakvale
---
I'm not surprised at all. Is Pete Hines still MIA on twitter?
---
The promises of transparency and open communication are straight up bull at this point. They've rang hollow for a long time, but now it's clear that they just don't care to even give lip service.
---
Yup. Yup. I went to Watoga Emergency and has a *** Super Mutant drop garbage nothing legendary.  Went and collected as much as I could came back 5 mins. later.... ZERO. NOTHING.   Bug is still there.
---
Yeah i have a tse 50 cal...and i might as well not even aim.  The Lmg i have is like a laser...as long as you can compensate for the recoil. Its very accurate
---
Dude, that's pee. 
---
Your's would glow if you had like 12 mutations too 
---
OH MY GOD I JUST BOUGHT MARSUPIAL FROM MODUS CAUSE NO ONE WAS SELLING IT AUUGHHH.
---
I've been selling since 8pm lol
---
Game people to talk to and give you quests, radier gangs, rescue prisoners, help trapped people, help roveing gangs of settlers make a new home, have towns with more life in them.  
---
All the things you *can* technically do with robots but why would you care if it was robots
---
None sensible adult is no longer playing this game. Only kids with a parent credit card can fund this shit show.
---
When I would crash playing survival in fo4 (only got to save while sleeping) I would attribute the crash to my character having a heart attack or brain aneurysm. 
---
It saved me from smashing my controller from losing hours of gameplay because I couldn't find a bed on my way back home 
---
the Purveyor is a mole man right? Has anyone considered why he's doing this? Will we be inadvertently equipping his mole man army with better equipment for some eventual power grab?
---
Be careful dwellers! I believe we are paving the way to our own subjugation!
---
Yeah, he'll be a mole miner. The first non-hostile mole miner!
---
The jet will make you jittery 
---
Well, yes, that's what I meant! It's not on the 3rd floor IRL though, and it's usually open as it's being used as a ballroom :) 
---
Enclave bunker armoury. It's just mods not plans.
---
However be prepared to server hop. A lot. There are only ever 2 or 3 mods on sale at a time, and it is luck of the draw. Took me forever to find the jet pack and still haven't found the shocks (although I could have been concentrating more on seeing the jet pack to notice!).
---
At that level, I was leaning on the hunting rifle as the ammo was plentiful. Ammo is less of a problem now for my handmade so I use it 90% of the time. Better durability than the hunting, better recoil/accuracy, and you can pop off two shots quickly, meaning more ammo usage, but better damage in the same amount of time as one shot from the hunting. It's a bit situational though, and others swear by the lever. One thing though: I got the 5 mods I most wanted for the handmade in 8 tries, so it is a lot of screws but well worth it.
---
This is the thing. They're all operating under the eternally growing profits. But the thing is: sooner or later, that's gotta crash. It's not sustainable. And they just burned a whole lot of goodwill over the past four months.
---
Go through Fleetwood and the early quest locations daily.
---
Once you've hit the enemy you can use the hit marker as a point of reference.
---
There is only one summer trainee graphic designer left with FO76. Everyone else are already on another projects. Weapon skins are coming, but it will take some time.
---
Yeah but it has a crosshair until you aim and then the gun lifts a little and it vanishes
---
Ok I’ll Invite you 
---
More of a solo guy but ill give it a look. My character doesn't look very BoS though.
---
I'm surprised the mothman statue actually was a thing xD Loved to see Harpers Ferry and that little "fort" &lt;3 They did a great job in my eyes! You too mate!
---
The cowardly zero star legendary NPC's have a bug in their AI, been reported since beta and hope it gets fixed soon, started with Supermutants and now more (non-Supermutants) are showing up that way
---
I had one guy recently who leveled half of my camp and when asked about his reasoning, proceeded to say "the door was locked" and go into the classic tryhard spiel. I really don't get what they gain from it, I gotta say.
---
I guess it would make sense but shes just snnoying imo. 
---
That's what your alt is for, to learn from your 'mistakes' so to speak. The first play through is a meandering bike ride of chaos. The second time is a sprint in a luxury sports car.
---
As a little trick that works 75% of the time, if you start shooting **then** go into aim mode without letting go of the trigger the crosshairs stay there on screen
---
Unless its ultracite or has anti armor or something, don't use laser weapons.
---
I've always found controllers more cumbersome for aiming and looking around compared to a mouse. Really just cannot get used to them.  
---
The only reason I have one for my PC is driving in GTA games and flying in Far Cry games. Mouse for the rest.
---
Whatever works, amirite
---
I really love all the cool stuff you guys do, but I don't use Twitter. Is there any other way to join?
---
I think Bethesda get the message 
---
The stabilized perk in the Int tree when maxed out makes your .50 cal extremely accurate. While in power armor that is but still it's made a significant difference for me
---
Fasnacht man mask, can be found in a half busted safe in the bank at the new Appalachian trainyard.
---
That's awesome that more people are seeing the herd of behemoths. Just knowing that, that is a thing makes me want to go back constantly
---
What's confusing ? There's no such thing as OP build. It's about what you like 
---
I have found the same thing with my combat rifle. I don't suppose you found out any more info about this? You would think that if stalkers really didn't work there would be more chat about it. 
---
I run one handed stealth and my usual go to weapon is the Blade of Bastet and a vampire/+strength ski sword. 
---
There really isnt one particular place to find specific swords. You just have to grind those legendaries. 
---
**YOUR MOTHER WAS A HAMSTER, AND OUR FATHER SMALLED, OF ELDERBERRIES!**
---
Honestly at the moment, a lot of builds are seeming viable. If melee team up with some ranged builds, if not melee builds are like fish in a barrel.
---
That's a bold statement.
---
Underrated comment
---
completely annoying..but so was Travis in FO4, and he ended up growing on me
---
Oh okay. So someone just must have been through the area before me. Thank you!
---
I'd rather get a lead pipe. I have 500 shotgun shells, but lead is fungible for any kind of ammo.
---
Yea pick a style and go (or no style, works for a few of my friends).  If you are like me and want/need guidance, peruse some builds online then make your own. If you dont know about nukes and dragons, you will love it. Exactly what you are looking for
---
Personally I use a small piece of a Post-It note corner on the screen. I use a different weapon to put it in place and now just line up with enemies when aiming. Works great, and no issues. 
---
Corner of the sticky side, maybe half a centimeter. Just big enough to see, not too much that it is in the way. 
---
Scorched sometimes use weapons that are at zero (or negative) condition and they don't show up as loot. The machete was a backup weapon.
---
Mainly I play alone, I started a melee build but I realize that it is a mess for certain points ... I would like to focus on a build without atomic armor and with a handmade rifle ... There is some build you can take inspiration?
---
Turret =/= torrent
---
I don't think the zealots effect works on her. Your best bet is rapid fire heavy anti armor weapons, they tear through her.
---
Did you ever get it and was it u see level?
---
Sounds like you have the game installed on a fragmented disk. 5,400?   Buy a cheap SSD it will blow you away. And yes that clock speed is going to hurt too but not as much as the disk. Big open world games stream lots of textures and models, it's outdated to think disk access speed doesn't matter for gaming.
---
Fallout 4 can run on a machine a whole generation older than 76 can.
---
Yeah me too, but that's because I started using a mouse for FPS games with Quake and have a couple decades of experience. I've started using a controller sometimes for the past few years because it is a different experience. I'm way better at it today than I was a few years ago.
---
I just did it today. The loots alright I guess. 
---
Tipsy Test doesn’t give you the recipe.  The other one, Wasted On gives you the recipe to make it for him. 
---
The only way for you to finish Tipsy is to be able to make it yourself or find it somewhere.  
---
Schorchbest Queen
---
Double check your Daily tab in the Pipboy just incase it didn’t set the quest as active.
---
Hop server to cancel it and then talk to Biv again to start it if you haven’t been able to finish the quest as a result.
---
If neither of these work submitting a ticket is best suggested.
---
Thought I was the only one crashing at the SBQ. I'm so salty when it happens since I got a nice computer.
---
I've just got a stalkers combat rifle and noticed no difference in vats to my regular rifle, save it costing more ap. When you say not giving you 100% as usual, do you mean that it normally actually says 100% for your first shot? Or only that it always hits no matter what number it says? 
---
Just find or brew it. I have a WIDE assortment of alcohol i now keep in my stash (1 or 2 of each, but just for variety). Sometimes it still doesnt matter and i need to brew a fresh one (when the action of brewing is the quest) 
---
I agree with you to a certain degree. Owning a workshop costs caps and resources. Therefore people should have all the right in the world to lock the generators to protect themselves to a degree from unauthorized access. I also agree that it should turn it solely into a functioning place but if someone else wants it how are they going to claim it without PVP? Being forced to leave a session for a workshop doesn’t seem very fair and what if most of them are taken whilst session hopping? I believe me, don’t like PVP as the next person who thinks it’s dumb but in terms of workshop PVP I’m sort of fine with it.
---
In a post apocalypse world hair style and pajamas are way more important than weapons, at least that’s what the senile management at Bethesda thinks. 
---
I just booted up a copy of Quake 2 yesterday to try out the new RTX realtime raytracing rendering and it rocked!
---
By level 58 I was chasing scorchbeasts to kill them, the mid levels are the hardests, but you'll get through them with a slow and steady grind. Don't rush the game. 
---
No. No it isn't at all.
---
being able to unclaim a workshop is a no brainier, it should've been included right from the start.
---
selling your claimed workshop is something I hadn't considered before, and I like the idea..being able to set your own price could lead to some interesting situations
---
If you go into pacifist mode then you'll never risk becoming accidentally wanted again. Problem solved.
---
Indeed. Breaking the game is the point of Beta. There was no break between Beta and the real game. I saw no point in the Beta other than giving a preview of the game.
---
Boys lets calm down. Lets just crack open a nuka cola and chill out a bit.
---
I have like 30 air drop holos in my inventory right now though at only lvl 46. I feel like by 50 I would have every single weapon plan available. 
---
Me too. In survival mode. It was glorious. Even built a turret camp at Whitespring with no-one to piss off. Oh the extravagance!
---
Got any favorite youtube channels on whittling you'd care to share?
---
I totally agree with you, after the type of mentionned comportement came with education, if parents don't learn to their kids the respect, empathy and everything, in game or in real life these kids will be "bad" people.
---
For my case I'm 14 yrs old but I'm trying to be respectfull and everything but sometimes when i go back to my house when school is over, i see people witch are like 10-16 yrs old just putting their evaluation/chwen gum/trash in mail box of people, sometimes they are drinking alcohol and they are smoking near school, they insult random people, put music with max volume and many others thing.
---
Just to say that those people don't stick to the game to make fun of others people. Greetings from France (sorry for every mistakes in this post).
---

---
This is my unarmed build I can get up to 4k base damage 
---
Atomic armor? Not sure what you mean with that. But I run a commando build, Auto handmade, combat rifle, and an AA betters crit lever action. Good things to focus on if you want to be right in the heat of things, tank killer for the armor penetration, and some crit perks and anything that mitigates damage. I mean I have mine pretty sound ATM, can't really afford to move much around now as it's pretty affective. Can send you a pic when I get home this afternoon as reference.
---
T-60 BoS paints are badly reused assets in my opinion. No Brotherhood bodies in Fallout 76 are wearing anything other than T-51b. It's just plain though.
---
Cool. I'm thinking about getting one of those RTX cards later this year, but it's a hard choice with an mITX rig.
---
Why would I buy a workshop from someone when I could kill them for it?  
---
You're fine. The way to "win" in survival is to work on seeing them before they see you. 
---
And to realize that you are going to die. Sometime a lot 
---
Sure, you'll be able to buy "Return to last server passes" out of the Atom shop for 1k atoms. 
---
You have to spend caps to contest the workshop as is, so the owner could just sell it and save you the trouble. IF the owner doesn't accept, then PvP would be enabled as it is now. The PvP system wasn't mean to be replaced, it was to allow more peaceful and smooth interactions. 
---
Same reason all of the enemies have seemingly unlimited ammo and drop 1 round of .308
---
Truth be told I haven't really looked up many videos. Kinda just winging it. But i might give it a look and if I find anything I'll let you know!
---
My problem with Uranium Fever is that they're usually low level legendaries. 
---
My missiles go to the bottom of the river near flatwoods.  And the mini nukes. 
---
Essential PC mods for me are Better Inventory and Save Everything. There's also a Perk Loadout mod, but it involves setting up your decks on a separate website, so I don't use it.
---
Just a guess here, but I suspect they are testing different tractics to get folks to spend their free Atoms. Things like bundles, flash sales, limited time sales, cleaning house sales. Once they have figured out the optimal give us your Atoms cycle they will introduce the really cool skins and folks will pay legit money because they have already been sucked dry of the free Atoms.
---
Thanks, I would like it
---
It’s mostly aesthetics, I think. And they’re probably men playing as female characters. 
---
I'll help you man. Can I see your build? 
---
Usually DPS (damage per second) is more important than sheer damage. The Black Powder Rifle &amp; Dragon have insane per shot damage but the DPS is incredibly low compared to the handmade, gauss or lever. Used to swear by black powder until I realized 3-4 shots from just about anything else will do the same job much quicker. 
---
I'd pay atoms for that. Like only if he stayed at your camp like a good boy, and didn't give you serious tactical advantages. Like at most she could bark at shit and tussle with mole rats.
---
"Bark bark", *A potential threat is approaching our camp*.
---
"Hey cool camp bruh. OMG IS THAT A PUPPER??!!"
---
"Bark", *Stand down red alert*.
---
Exactly what I wanted to consult online and perfect my build
---
A totally unique opinion that needed another post.  
---
/s
---
I wasn't expecting the recipe. He has always given me 1 bottle of the drink to test for the quest. 
---
Very true. Kinda keep going when I see it pop up in the vain hope of a furious Gatling 😂
---
Yes its worth it, and I only use two class freak perks.
---
Indenting by four spaces makes your updates unreadable.
---
Server hopping didn't drop the quest which is unusual since it usually screws up all the other daily quests.
---
I had my camp around that same area and the same thing happened to me. I spawned into my camp, turrets are going crazy, and when I turn around the corner a huge moth thing is there. Scared the shit out of me because I didn't know what it was. Unfortunately, it also disappeared after I shot it a few times. I thought it was just a bug, but they must spawn in that area. 
---
Today is red ant lager - I'm pretty sure you can't find that in the world, right? Don't have the recipe either.
---
There are more than 12,000 species of ants all over the world.
---
If someone takes a workshop you don't want.  Just let them have it. 
---
One can put a listing up on here (fo76 bazaar) or the other online marketplaces. Think I saw some listed for 1k caps per leg/jetpack.
---
Ive gotten two jetpacks in the past months, and one calibrated shock. Random spawn at Enclave is very spotty. 
---
Because there is a loot table for generating the drop from each enemy. It's normal mmo mechanic. Otherwise they will never drop armor or more than one weapon.
---
it's a PEGI 18/M Rated ERSB game.  Kids shouldn't be playing it. Game companies really need to start following and enforcing this. 
---
No, I’ve done it every day since the patch.  He never gave the drink to me prior to it.  I keep 2 of every drink in my stash so I can always grab it when needed. 
---
?
---
Yeah I really wanted the plans so that I can craft them but looks like I might just go with T-60 instead 
---
&gt; I'm hoping it isnt Beth doing an underhanded marketing trick to get us to buy their repair kits.
---
Wolf!  Wolf!  I've seen a wolf!
---
Then trade for one. Sometimes they are overly generous and award you with the brew needed in the begining, other times it requires work and thought. Unfortunately, rad ant lager isnt all that cheep caus it is damn useful
---
I find it funny that we normally hav consistent responses on random threads from bethesda employees at least once a day, but not a single response from anyone since the repair kit leak.
---
I've NEVER heard a legendary gutsy say "fall back!". Just calls me a chicken shit commie and rips me a new one. 
---
Comparing ranges and follow up shot times vs. the bolt action, I find it’s hard to beat a scoped lever action for sniping.  I prefer the handmade with a reflex dot for mid range work, especially when multiple targets are engaged. The semi-auto action of the handmade delivers effective fire much quicker at those distances without the issue of excessive magnification that a sniper scoped rifle often provides. The lever wearing a high powered optic outperforms the bolt driven long guns and had proven to be the better long range choice for me.
---
Loyal and loving customers need to understand this is a business that has expenses.You arent gonna pay the bills with pink too-toos and fucking beehive hair-do's
---
Yeah, but it would be nice to also have this system, it wouldn't change the current methods.

I didn read past youre first sentance. You're condecending as fuck
---
Good! I'm sick of all of the negative posts and I'm excited about the repair kits.
---
What?  Duping that way doesn't work anymore.  You can use a friend in Social menu to return to the same server already, I don't see how giving everyone this option is an issue.
---
No limit = absurd God like FO4 characters with no true specification
---
The limitations require careful planning to get a powerful character. In FO4 your character was basically guaranteed to get OP as you weren't ever limited, every card was fair game.
---
The lock pick cards are situational, as are most of the repair &amp; crafting cards. They're only used a few minutes of each day &amp; shouldn't be equipped the rest of the time (Super Duper ain't gonna help fighting mutants).
---
Guess I personally like it. 
---
&gt;rad ant lager isnt all that cheep caus it is damn useful
---
I did a rad ant lager quest yesterday and it actually gave me -50 carry weight instead of 50.  Was odd.  First time I ever drank one.  Drank it, did the crit hit then went to fast travel back to Biv and noticed I was at 277 instead of 327.  Checked effects and it said Rad Ant Lager :  Carey Weight -50.  
---
Would love to see the pack rifle colours make a comeback 
---
Months of grinding? I find that amount of good shit or more daily without even looking for it. 😂
---
I got them, 3 shocks and 2 jetpacks, 2 of which I scrapped because of durability inconsistencies which annoyed me. Took about 7h for all of them.
---
I got it on my main character just to make sure it wasn’t under leveled, guess that knowledge will remain a mystery to me for now 
---
He never gives you the drink. You can get a random one as a reward for completing it.
---
Or right at the end of an event
---
I thought of selling someone a workshop ideas before but it thought of it in a different way.
---
Instead of the way you suggested I thought I could leave someone a certain resource I'm collecting. 
---
For example say player wanted one of my acid collectors but I didn't want to give up the workshop because I wanted the acid myself.  In addition I also have three acid collectors.
---
Why cant there be a mechanic where players gives me a small amount of caps to be able to own the resource collector for a small amount of time.  
---
Yes I can unlock it and let him take from it but then other players who didnt pay would be able to take it from the guy who bought from me. I also dont wanna group up with the guy because then he would have full access to the other two collectors 
---
Most of the time, it’s the server crashing so there is not server to return to.
---
That's actually a really good idea
---
Too many Melee scorched for the hive mind to think about anything else 😂 love seeing this , had some smack me with 50 cal before 
---
I consider speed demon to be one of the 5 essential mutations everyone should have. 
---
Server nukashine!
---
Semi-auto builds have become a bit frustrating, you have to carry around 3 or 4 inexplicably heavy rifles because they're all apparently made out of pot metal.
---
Apparently so. I've run into muties and scorched trying to flank me on several occasions.  
---
I also had Protectrons fail their morale check and run from me. 
---
Not nearly as ignorant and arrogant as you.
---
Collect tech data. Turn it in at Fort Venture. Rinse and repeat.
---
Or you can buy em.
---
Lever. Not only is the DPS terrific it just looks and sounds cool.  The ammo capacity (5) is a problem however. 
---
That's probably the worst feeling in the world. I spent an hour bringing up the power plant and setting up the workshop only to be disconnected 30 seconds after leaving to explore the world. I haven't touched workshops since.
---
Truth is the game was rigged from the start 
---
Yeah, I'm assuming they want to combine that with indestructible camps. That way we don't have to worry about putting ourselves on the map.
---
You have a mental illness. Need to stop talking to you before i get your autism. I checked your comment history. You actually call people "prey" and you are just as insane on other posts in this sub. Go be a sad excuse for a person on a survival server in your shitty game some more.
---
I’ve been hoping for this, I’ve mentioned before that we need 3 load outs: One for camp with passive skills, One for general use and One for power armour use. 
---
We could then customise each load out to our specific play style and switch between as needed. 
---
As a person playing unyielding bloodied sneaker I think I could be nerfed and still powerful enough, but leaving more viability for other playstyles.
---
I suspect that it's the side effect of having multiplayer. Compare the behavior to Fallout 4. In Fallout 4 you loot a gun from raider corpse and the gun disappears. This means you were looting right from his inventory. If this was the case in Fo76 then the first player would loot from the inventory and then there would be no more guns for other players eligible for loot. Bethesda decided that every player needs to have his own loot, his so called "instanced loot". Therefore the dead scorches has additional "inventories" for each player and the main inventory is inaccessible. 
---
The reason why every player can loot different weapon from each other and from the weapon seen ingame probably comes from leveled lists. Leveled list is a form type used when creating/modding the game. It contains set of items (or other lists) and levels when they should be used.Basically, there is probably a leveled list for scorched with melee weapons. Let's say "ScorchedMeleeList" that contains all the weapons like machete, axe, lead pipe, etc... this ScorchedMeleeList gets assigned to inventory of the scorched and then ingame a random weapon get selected from the list. I suspect that the secondary inventory for player loot is assigned the same ScorchedMeleeList. When looting, a random weapon from the list gets selected but there's no guarantee that it will be the same as the one the scorched is holding. There are probably no mechanisms to syncronize the inventories. At least there were none in Fallout 4...
---
I got downvoted to fuck because I basically said someone was being dramatic about the fact that they were ‘bullied’ on this game (someone fucked up their base and killed them) like wtf let’s not conflate real world issues with losing a fucking video game. Jesus. 
---
People say the AI is dumb but, yes, I've seen some tactical improvements with the creatures over previous fallout titles.
---
Because I don't have or want friends in this game?
---
lol you’re an idiot. 
---
Oh yeah! I saw one of those as well, noticed that I couldn’t pick it up but didn’t think twice about it. Can’t recall where it was I saw that
---
Looked for it as well. Haven't found it. 
---
The voip never works for me. I press the push to talk button hold and more than half the time no speaker icon. 
---
Tell ya what, for you, you're in. PM us for details. 
---
What makes it worse is the changes to adventure mode make it pointless. You can't hurt them unless them shoot first or back.  In adventure mode there is no reason to be worried about another player at all unless you are at a work shop( or pvp event).
---
It would be nice if such a feature was a toggleable option for that. You could divide it into three options: all loot, rare loot, and no loot. That way people can at least have some control over it and not miss things they want.
---
The lady talks up the final boss, then you kill him with one swing of you’re weapon, it’s honestly asinine.
---
Do a lot of folks use chameleon?  I bought a piece with my style of "run away and hide as fast as possible", but I'm not sure how well it'll work in survival.
---
and here is my low health unarmed build, obviously many similar things but as you can see we have many different perts. Neither build is "better" just works on our play style and experience. I never have any issues outside of nuke zones with armor/weapon durability so I dont run makeshift warrior (butt still have the 5 int so i can craft whatever i want).  My ABSOLUTE best advice is to check out a few builds of the STYLE you want to play, then remake the build to suite your play style best.  I couldnt take off through hiker for 50 levels, my buddy cannot take off good with salt, some builds are sick, but they are rarely "complete" because everyone's "quality of life" perks will vary (or be nonexistant)
---
I was desperate at the time for them on a side note I did not pay for them I found them eventually myself thanks though

This is the first time this has been mentioned and is definetley not in the list of topics already raised a mlion times and not to make more of. 
---
Yeah I have so much carry weight I honestly dont need reduce weight perks lol I have like 445 carry weight its crazy
---
Just start a new character to act as a mule to hold all your junk. Just use s friend to help transfer.
---
They could even have given it the full "we're Bethesda, of course it's going to be a dumpster fire when we turn it on, help us turn it around, give us advice on how you want things to work", they could have built a strong community (instead of the die hards that need to defend the game from the release state coverage it still gets).  
---
YouTube bug compilation videos would have been "hurry up if you want to use this trick or funny glitch, it'll be gone by next week", instead of "everything is on fire!".  
---
As it is, they're breaking their assurances that the atom store would be cosmetic only and are introducing game mechanic altering elements in an attempt to make us pay for their screw up.  
---
For the new generation of gamers, paying extra to play the game you've already bought is normal, so they won't even know to complain.
---
Yes, I was replying to the guy who said "There are reasons they don't want us to have this option" and providing evidence that is claim was nonsense.
---
Yea. Running bloody has many bonuses like that. If i get into any power armor not called excavator i usually acnnot walk. Lol. All 5 pieces of my armor are deep pocketed so it is like having 1 calibrated shock 😋
---
M'lion
---
Stop looking for guarantees. This is a rando looter shooter. You want a guaranteed legendary check the market place.
---
God damn it beat me to the edit. 
---
Yeah it gets crazy especially at the queen I can solo her in like 2 minutes unarmed build is super op
---
So you know a way of duping that still works?
---
Odd. So weird responses.  Sounds like some people are saying they go weeks without repairs.   I play for a couple hours and all my weapons (and armor) break.  Had a separate thread about it
---
Grafton responder bot thats in the middle of the town has trapper mods
---
Best fucking LPT I’ve heard so far for this game.
---
Shame I’m friendless haha
---
I've got some,wich ones do U want?
---
Easier said than done :/
---
To be fair.... I didn’t give a rats arse about ratings when I was 12-13. Games weren’t real social then I suppose. 
---
I had the exact same issue! I just couldn’t seem to find addictol anywhere and this is the first time I’d drank alcohol.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can give you a spare, otherwise the only place I’ve found addictol is on top of the fireplace in pleasant valley. The building with turrets.
---
Yeah it  was 1day deal
---
I still say kids parents should be finned if they are caught giving access to games like GTA V or any adult "ish" game like that to kids, especially if they are below the age rating, as well as the game in question being taken away from them.
---
... maybe its a scorched holding a machete with an axe skin he got from atomic shop?
---
I usually find mine with Pharma Farma equipped. I found some addictol laying about but sadly I’ve no idea where
---
I'm asking for a reason to do all the other events that give crap rewards with crap enemies. I'm getting close to lvl 200. There is literally nothing for me to do now except farm legendary gear and sell it on the market. I'm fairly certain that most people avoid almost all events because they simply aren't worth doing. I'm asking for a reason to do them.
---
This happened to me yesterday. It especially hurts when you have to build all the resources from scratch and you get kicked from a server or the game freezes on you. 
---
Oh yeah. I only had 2 from before. One I learned. One I sold. I have these four since the paints were added.
---
also if you are on xbox I can spare a couple for you
---
I've had that happen a few times. I've also had my bloody mess perk make the body parts fall into the void before I could loot them lol 
---
Watoga emergency services usually has some
---
Don't listen to him. Use them if you want.
---
I have them on my older character and I camped workshops for weeks I think they came from a random defend workshop reward for me.
---
If you use Pharma Farmer (or whatever the Search med containers for Meds perk is) they turn up pretty commonly.
---
There's a food that cures addictions, but I can't remember what.  Frog legs, or Scorpion Eggs, or something.
---
Thanks! 
---
Ok cool, found your question while I was googling it ;)
---
I always have level 1 pharma farmer, maybe I should upgrade. Thanks! 
---
I have can add all for the LA on XB.
---
That's my guess, moved my camp down further south for the time!
---
I can't think of one I'm sure is static and respawns. I know the other posters offered you some on Xbox but if you're on PS4 I can give you a couple.
---
Can't believe this isn't a top priority yet. Probably one of the most requested things.
---
Looks pretty close to my Super sledge build, add some nice mutations and you should have loads of fun👍
---
Yeh also does anyone have a two shot explosive weapon I'm up for trades.
---
I believe the red dot stays if you shoot in 3rd person. It’s how I aim long range with heavy weapons.
---
I’m not on atm [ps4 also] but can ask on reddit just look for someone with high karma and quickly scan threw their past post to determine if they are trustworthy.
---
If you can hang on till lvl 28 you can equip Batteries Included in intelligence which lowers them dramatically. You have to have them on you, not in your stash though
---
The ammo us easier to come by for me and I’m a heavy weapons build
---
When the legendary vendor drops my inventory weight will drop drastically and I won't know what to do with all that space lol
---
Strength and unarmed or two handed.
---
Meat hooks benefit from both unarmed and one handed perks.
---
Adrenal reaction, healing factor, marsupial, twisted muscles would be amazing x
---
Maybe those kids should be playing 4chan instead? 
---
The updated mod is beeing beta tested as we speak. Its been online in test since wednesday.
---
I am interested.
---
I don’t have the mods so I usually just pay people to put them on. I have the beam focuser, the prime part, and charging barrel, so is charging barrel the way to go? It’s highest damage but lowest rof
---
The radscorpion omelette does that. I've got a couple and I feel like even with Good With Salt they'll go bad before I need em.
---
I have personally posted about this topic within last few months but it's cool that this didn't make the cut as long as they are fixing other stuff. This would just make things convenient; glitches and bug resolution is more important 
---
So my brother and I got our first 360 just before I left for collage he was nine first game we had was Halo Reach. We play that game all the time because I knew he could handle what was in it. After 76 came out he wanted to play it. I came back home for a weekend and it feel to me to convince our mum. She had just shot down him playing fortnight (because it was battle royal, not how she said it but the meaning was clear.)  After we talked about it she agreed to let him play 76 because of the themes. 
---
76 is the story of the last people trying to fix the world and avoid the mistakes of the past. We trust him to understand the themes because he has shown to be worth the trust. Not every one should have that at his age, I should not have been playing this game(not just only for the time paradox) because I would have been a greifer. You won't always know wat your kids can handle all the time but you should have better ways to handle it then what was displayed here. Go play mine craft or something else on a closed server. (From mobile sorry if unreadable.)
---
Port forwarding may help 
---
Yup me too.  I need lots of tokens in the knowledge I will not get good legendary rerolls.  
---
They are the mutated remnants of the Huntersville farmers.  They never had anyone to train them.
---
They're doing the best they can man! Back off!!
---
That's awesome. Thanks for that.
---
Idk what it is...but i want atomic armor!
---
I use incisor, martial artist, and either slugger, gladiator, or iron fist (depending on your weapon preference) for strength (I'd recommend going for 15 strength). Then I do makeshift warrior and gunsmith for intelligence (not necessarily needed but makes your weapons break slower). Then for agility, I go for ninja, escape artist, and sneak to maximize damage. And, finally, for luck I do luck of the draw (because repairing weapons is a pain in this game). All of these perks are focused around weapon damage or weapon durability, although I would suggest going for White Knight under agility as your armor will tend to break quickly in close combat. I hope this helps. 
---
Right?
---
Trade with players for much less than that. Also, yes. 
---
I'm online now if you want some shocks 
---
Except there are too many assholes who would simply see this as a cap farming opportunity game mechanic. 
---
Unless the box is one way only accessible by the owner then it would be fantastic 😎
---
It’s prime and I’m just using it for the sbq. I’ve got all the heavy weapon perks, and the one that makes heavy weapons ignore 45% of armor. I think it work decently.
---
The other end. 
---
make sure you have starched genes 2 before you use rad away
---
I can get up to 4k base damage with shis build
---
Tbh, I feel like they should go down a list of each and every event and rework them - minor or major.  They have acknowledged event participation is low, and I think they should really look at why that is.  Notifications.  Remaining duration.  Glitches.  Weird enemy spawns.  Time invested vs. reward.  Long periods of time just standing \*waiting\*.  Enemy "waves" with one enemy.  
---
Truth, but I was thinking more of a owner only type of thing.
---
I'd give specific kinds of packages - like we get a choice of 3
---
Construction Drop - Steel / Wood bulk and other materials needed for camps and crafting
---
Survival Drop - Food Water Stimpacks Radaway
---
Defense Drop - random collection of ammo and grenades 
---
You know things that would actually be put inside of a military drop that actually make sense instead of random bits and pieces of random junk someone found and stuffed in a box 
---
Apart from the engine looking like a PS3 game.
---
And have this load outs saveable to our favourites wheel \^\^ ty
---
I hadn't heard anyone else reporting this, glad to know it's a widespread problem. I get it every time I play.
---
What's worse about it, is the way that enemies can damage and even kill you before you've even loaded them. There's been a few instances of loading in and my health suddenly dropping to half or lower, THEN the enemy showing up, THEN ALSO having no bullets and no quick swap.
---
the trick is the nuke drop, if you dont do it yourself so many people just put Prime in the middle of the nuke instead of the edge.  After last queen rework, I rarely see her dropped when nuke is centered on prime where the unarmed builds like mine need to come in PA and use different weapons (not the biggest deal for me caus I only picked up unarmed build well past level 100 so i just pull out my good Ole G-Axe and perk swap)
---
I like to think they're foil wrapped chocolate. Like those gold coins.
---
Pretty sure that's been done away with, and this site/sub would be the wrong place to ask.
---
Thanks for the info
---
Same thing that entertained people in NV and FO4, monster vs. monster, monster vs. player and player vs. player arena death matches. If only Bethesda would bring back those arena pieces to our CAMPs.
---
thats why a license for having a baby should be introduced

---
Yep same here and I hate when people dont launch the queen properly but they probably dont k me about us unarmed builds lol
---
The mire in the NE is a good place mid game because you need to g there alot but train stations are a good walk away. In adventure use it to save on fast travel so if there is a location you go alot build it near there. You can look up the resource map and find something you are running low on.
---
Hey class freak as well to minimize the negative effects.
---
Don’t pay more than 200 per serum.  Tons of people sell them for that much.
---
This is on my WTF list. The hand scanners being reversed. The grade on train tracks.
---
The little things.
---
I’d definitely donate to some of the excellent camps I’ve come across if it was a secure box.
---
Yup. Another way to do this is by making certain perks work passively. They will cost 0 to equip but will require some points on charisma, intelligence, etc. (you can’t have lvl 3 home defense with only 2 intelligence)
---
I think you'll find that incisor, which gives 75% armor penetration, will be more helpful than stacking slugger 3 times. I personally also use Blocker as well, leaving me 3 strength points for slugger, iron fist, or one handed. 
---
Oh crap. I'm dumb. Didn't even think of that
---
50 Fusion Cores? tbh: throw them away. There is a easy way to farm these:
---
&gt;!At the Workshop "Poseidon Energy Plant Yard"  North east from Charlston, there is a fusion core ressource thing and it can hold up to 3 and produces 7 per hour, when i remeber correctly. You might restart the powerplant to get free energy for that. Better than using flux!&lt;
---
10 to 20 cores are more than enough just for Power Armor. I usually go with 10 but because i prepared myself for survival and launching a nuke, i thought more cores might be good but i barley used some.
---
Storage space is a problem but knowing what its worth to keep, is key. Whats needed is the legendary vendor to get rid of unwanted legendary mods. Scrapping junk is key. Also keeping weapons is not nessesary, when there are not level 45-50 and aren't legendary. Look what you might else have. Keeping big amounts of Rad-away or other stuff is also not nessesary. When you have weight reduction perks, carry such items around. The game has different vendors from varios factions and each faction has their own caps (will get changed). Buying stuff at such a vendor gives him a bit of caps back.  
---
I think paying real money for more storage space is not good. I would rather have more CAMP Items to display certian stuff, like PA, Bobbleheads and Magazines. This can be limited per camp. You also could use a 2nd char and use it as mule, as it got mentioned before.  
---
Also don't keep unnessesary PA Frames. I had 10 or so and it isn't worth keeping. With renaming stuff, it might be okay to have a frame with every kind of PA Armor on it. 
---
No, the guy was talking like he didn't people to reconnect because supers would use it. Does he know something we don't?
---
I actually thought I could unclaim a workshop till a few days ago when I wanted to do it.  Kind of surprised (but not really) that it wasn't an option!  
---
I would also love for an indication on resource times.  When I first started I thought the lights on the machines were an indication of progress, and that the lights filled up over time (as it looks kind of like a loading bar).  Turns out it isn't :P  My suggestion is to make it one :D

Digital is a great format for this generation, but when you're dealing with a console it's kind of a pain in the ass. Even games that have been out for years will stay full price on PSN, whereas a physical copy will go for a sixth of that. Looking for a third party with a code they want to sell at a loss might be hard. Post back if you find any good deals though.
---
I hope they add higher level weapons...  They don't even need to add them every 10 levels :(
---
Probably like someone else mentioned the chance to attack a legendary enemy so then you have a chance to get a weapon drop that might make it worth it as well. I know personally I don't ever really need any mats or aid but a chance to find a better weapon or plan might make me do them. But your idea works for probably the majority of people I'm just a hoarder so I don't run out lol

Seriously, i gave advice to extend their life.  Why would someone down vote well intentioned advice? Downvoting here is for rule violations.  Thats ridiculous!
---
What's your gt?
---
tbh, i dont care about "YOU" but that is just deciding to go to war without your airforce for no good reason.  Drop the nuke so that the nuke dropper is most likely to complete scortched earth, aka proper nuke placement.  
---
and if anyone reading this doesnt know what I am talking about, look up online for nuke placement. It pretty much just includes Prime within the blast zone's bottom left edge (leaving open the drop site).  That way, players can get to and start scortched earth MUCH faster (the timer starts right away, have as many there as fast as possible.  It also allows the queen to easily be pulled out of the nuke zone to get housed.

Recipes go for 2k-4k and serums go for 75c-200c join a barter group on FB and get them.

At the Top of the world, behind that, is a bunch of cabins. One of the cabins have wall turrets installed for some reason. In the bedroom of that cabin is a small table next to a chair. On that table, there is a high chance of an Addictol spawning. I usually go there. 
---
As someone already suggested, Watoga Medical Services is also a good choice. On a good day, I can find 3 Addictol in there with lvl 1 of the pharma farmer perk card (under luck).

Sounds awesome!

---
cdkeys has always been a good one for me but PlayStation don’t have the same campaign as Xbox do. Xbox will sell games as a digital copy on game cards whereas PlayStation tend to only sell on their online store. So finding digital copies for PlayStation is practically impossible for cheap.

Had the same idea. I also thought that maybe the camp owner can donate stuff to players that visit the camp. Maybe even a little minigame to win prizes. I think with the player vendor machines, people might open up their camp and offer a nice place.   
---
It's a good feeling to find a open camp, when you are too heavy  
---
I am wagering on the fermenter from nukeashine being the prototype for the vendor interface which is why it of all things was the first expansion. The issues with it is probably why pc vendors we're pushed back.
---
I can't find you can you join SEANZY 123
---
I have gotten 2 x lvl 25, and 1 x lvl 35.
---
trying to join you but failing 
---
Sent an invite there
---
I wish we could have a player hosted radio system, but people would ruin it within the first hour. 
---
I'm all for having insult bot or Rose as the host. It gets a bit lonely out there sometimes and I think having a host would give it some life. 
---
Well, maxing out Strength is a no-brainer.  You'll also want at least 5 points in Luck for Starched Genes and Bloody Mess, because there are some awfully good Mutations for melee players that you'll need to reach high damage (Twisted Muscles, Talons, Adrenal Reaction).  The perk Radicool is also essential.
---
The way you get damage into the thousands, however, is with Bloodied weapons which rely on being very low on health, using rads to keep your HP low.  That gets into the realm of evasive perks, like Serendipity and Dodgy and flat damage reduction like Lone Wanderer.
---
In PvE, this isn't necessary.  Most enemies will fall quickly as long as you're doing &gt;500 damage.
---
please resend
---
&gt; Having 7 sets of PA isn't too much of a deal since each one only weighs 2.5 LBS
---
Sounds like you're running the perk that reduces weight for power armor parts. If you're keeping them in your stash they weigh 10 lbs since perks don't apply to your stash. But it's worth it for me too, it's 60 lbs in the stash for all the ones I am not  using at the time but I wanted all of those sets. I have them all kitted out with mods except ultracite, those plans are slow going. That was my project for a while.
---
Stop by any time!!
---
on way to you
---
Power Armour srry
---
Don't worry, I heard it is in the works.  It will be an Atom shop item that will do that for you.   Only 5000.
---
Shower thought...whining in reddit is the same as whining to a parent.
---
thank you
---
Because some people are whining ungrateful infants who throw all the toys out after one issue, instead of sticking with the game and showing a little loyalty.
---
Don’t keep items you don’t actively need.  You can always get them later.  I dump stuff in the suitcases at Charleston and Whitesprings all the time.  You can use up those fusion cores just go around in PA even at 21 if you want.  Add pieces of PA at your level as you get them.   
---
Ironcally when I was tech data server hopping earlier I ended up on the same one about 8 times in a row. There's a lot of 40mm grenades in one of those ammo boxes now. 
---
 Anyhoo, yes. I really don't bother running silos anymore as I'm sick of it dcing straight after. The amount of blast zones I've seen lately makes me think I'm not alone.
---
Yes Bethesda, we really need a feature like that, added to the Atom shop of course.  10000 I am thinking for such a useful feature.
---
Yeah idk. There is this weird support to make this game like Minecraft. There are way more kids playing this than there should be. If they want to play, fine, but crap like this is obnoxious. like that post that hit the front page with gold silver and platinum whining about how someone made their special needs kid cry. Maybe they should be playing something that isn't completely online and rated M?Even more obnoxious are the fucking white Knights. "You're scaring these kids." Christ, throw a "m'lady" in while you're at it.
---
Something I love about 76 is how friendly and fun the community is, but some are just overly sensitive and dramatic.
---
I'm just some rando but for what it's worth I don't think that's something they intended on players doing. It also sounds like it would make the game even more monotonous. I would just learn what to and what to not hold onto. Realistically most of the weapons and armor you find pre level 50 are going to be trash. You don't need hundreds of anything, really. I've started throwing out junk I have so much of it. Same for ammo, if you're not using it then it's pointless to keep.
---
Fuck 'em, go kill stuff. Even if you just put down the regular scorched and other mobs there you're helping out. Just be sure to hammer the queen for a bit to get your reward.
---
55 on first character is still fairly fresh, the game is super complicated.
---
Supposed to be? IDK why it would be.
---
But some people have issues reading text in all caps, it looks like you're yelling the names of the weapons. The bigger issue was lack of line breaks which you've taken care of.
---
Somebody nuked Whitesprings last night and I had a mob of ghouls chasing me, one if which was a there star legendary. With the help of the Whitesprings sentry bot I would have no problems. His health was finally so low that I could have thrown comrade chubs at him and he would have died. I pull the trigger to finish him... -server disconnected-
---
I was really looking forward to selling that next piece of wood armor to a vendor for 4 caps
---
I wish they were. I stopped doing them and accumulated so many tapes. I just drop them for others in a common area (hopefully they can pick them up).
---
Looking to buy and where can I get the plans
---
that would be a good addition. btw what is the new skin you're talking about? 
---
I'm from Chapmanville!
---
Thematically, with the strike breaker robots, that town should have been Logan or Matewan. But they wanted to include the exhibition coal mine so that's why they did it. 
---
Unfortunately you don’t need to release full completed games anymore, they just need to ‘fix’ them as they go (Whether or not they can keep the player base is another story). I don’t think I have bought a game in a long time on console that doesn’t require a huge download just to make the game playable on install
---
Oo I would like shielded. I'll help you get it. 
---
Or, if you like the Gatling Gun, your still don't have sights even after you get the sights.
---
Someday they'll fix that bug.... Someday...
---
Just have it an option, instead of just saying "claim this for 30 caps" or whatever, it could come up with "buy for X caps" or "Pay X caps and PvP" the buy option being whatever the current owner would sell it for and the PvP option being how it is now
---
If you are able to drop them, have you tried putting one in a container (file cabinet or something)? 
---
I think if I can display both pa and a random collection such as “mr fuzzies” I’d be a happy man
---
I'll help give your osn 
---
Handmade is great at all levels.  
---
Yeah that’s how I got so many cores [spoiler] that workshop is insane. Also one uranium ore, lead scrap, concrete and aluminium and water. 
---
It’s free basically considering the protection quest is easy and most of the mats are already there. [/spoiler]
---
And I suspect why people aren’t even interested in trading for them. Someone refused 10 cores for a single laser rattling gun which seemed insane to me, they then scrapped the gun!!
---
Iam still demanding Maxons Battlecoat 
---
Take off starched Gene's when your about to drink the mutation then put it back on so you dont waste your 2k caps
---
Progress your character up to level 100-150, you'll be able to adjust it to meet your needs, and you'll learn ehat you'd like in the meantime. When you get there, only then you'll be in position to create an 'educated' build. After level 50 you will be able to take points from your special stats and put them elsewhere so these utility perks might come in handy even if you perfected your character for combat in the future. Nothing is lost so far IMO, and I'm very deep into meta research.
---
Simply put, having a team fixes this issue. People refuse to group up. 
---
Thanks I sent a PM
---
Farm and server hop at the watoga emergency center. It's as the name implies you'll find a metric fuck ton of aid items. 
---
There definitely is a stress relief in scraping or selling stuff in the fallout franchise. But a lot of tension before you do it!
---
It’s the most enlightening experience to understand hoarders.
---
Only if it is an option to turn off, i hate seeing these numbers in games
---
The sarcasm is strong in this one
---
Just the chassis? I’ll do that actually it adds rad resistance right?
---
I think the carry weight benefit is negated by its own weight?
---
They're in the atom shop.
---
I don’t suppose you remember how much it was, just Incase it comes back?
---
no, im asking what the skin is. 
---
Reminds me of a post where a guy let his special needs kid build up his base, after a few hours it got “griefed” and the kid was in shambles. And this guys has the audacity to make a post complaining about how could people be so mean. This game launching with pacifist was a big mistake in terms of establishing normal interactions with players. You can not play this game in a bubble. 
---
So, to be clear... I'm not arguing for the repair kits being in the atomic shop.
---
But didn't they say deluxe kits will drop in the world, specifically from high level enemies? I mean, isn't it as simple as Bethesda adjusting the drop rate and including lower level enemies in that pool.
---
I think that ideally these kits should be craftable items and maybe the plans should drop from high level enemies.
---
I'm sure they've been told not to engage on this one. 
---
The fact that these eyesores exist just adds fuel to my "why is camp building so restrictive" fire.  
---
Seriously, thee exist but i can place a floor unless its snapped to a wall, or stairs unless theyre on a foundation, or a wall unless its on a foundation, or the wooden fence/railing piece unless its on a floor tile ect...
---
Definitely worth getting, even if you have to buy it
---
It’s a big you’re gonna have to make a new character and reach lvl 50 again
---
I can hear many Abe Simpsons in this thread. 
---
They haven’t done it yet and they probably won’t. Welcome to the broken game that is fo76. 
---
Hrmmm I do like that gun what's the issue with it?
---
The thing is i know people build these becuase of the no clipping rule that bethesda have, just allow people to place structures where they want and its their fault if half of it is underground or inaccessible or whatever, theres a budget on CAMPs anyway so its not like they can build more by clipping things together

Garrahan Excavator Power Armor Paint Set, available on the atomic shop
---
Exactly. There's a finite number of potential customers, who have a finite amount of money to spend. That can't be kept going eternally. Sooner or later this won't work anymore. And when you have companies like EA, who close a studio for their game selling ONLY 6 million copies then you know that this point was reached. 
---
Good news everyone! 
---
Weapon skins? Where tf are the hairstyles? We’ve had the same 3 since Christmas... unless there was a limited one I missed as I took a month break to play some other games. I bought the megaton because I thought it was awesome really brought me back to those Fallout 3 memories. Would love more. 
---
As has been mentioned bloodied with either 40% swing speed or power attack damage. And unyielding armour, which boosts your strength by up to 15. Whiskey is now very easy to craft, and gives you +6 strength with party boy/girl for 3 minutes. You can get 60% melee damage from food buffs which last 30 minutes to an hour. Blood on the harp magazines are super rare but they increase melee damage for an hour, twice as long with curator, and melee or unarmed bobbleheads as well. Radicool +5str, bloodied mess +15% damage, nerd rage +20% damage. Repair your melee weapon to 200% for increased damage, seriously my lvl 40 bloodied ripper does over 700 damage at 20% life when repaired to 200%. I also use Chem fiend and psychobuff for +3 are and 25% damage.
---
All this stuff can be expensive though, but if you've got the caps buy unyielding armour with either 15% damage reduction while sprinting per piece so you can safely make it to your target, or 15% damage reduction while blocking which if you've also got on your melee weapon stacks to a reduction of 90%, which means you can literally block bullets, start wars style.
---
One thing about the X-01 was that it was shown in fallout 2, but wasn't ever seen until 4, because it was still a prototype.
---
T-51b IS the best pre-war, but the X-01 was never commissioned into war. All the X-01 we find/craft are final prototypes.
---
The sights are completely out of alignment, like the whole gun is rotated 20° to the left.  The sights affect stats, but are useless for actually aiming
---
I rarely get disconnected or experience much in the way of bugs, but when i do, its at the worst times possible
---
Agreed. It would be a the same song over 100 times with obnoxious sounds from trolls. 
---
I think it’s good choosing tracks, but I feel it could backfire with trolls. It has to be a NPC in my opinion. 
---
All mods can be learned from scrapping 
---
Well aren't we fortunate enough to have macros 😛 us poor console jockies over here
---
All i want is active friends on my buddy list.For the group buffs and some people to talk to from time to time while playing. Not much need for actual grouping aside from future content or to save bullets.  But id gladly help anyone. Would be nice to have someone save me from server loss.  95% of my time spent is taking over a workshop and making houses/compounds.(Which is why i loathe the atom shop.)  Everyone i started with is gone. The first 2 months were great and i had a booming buddy list but out of those 20 i remain. Everyone i meet quits within 2 weeks its as if i catch them on the tail end of their nosedive. Its pretty hard to get anyone to do anything besides thumbs up anymore. That's if they aren't already dc'ing or running cause they think its troll time. Im on pc and i still play. Sometimes i wonder if its a curse to be on pc because so many people use discord and watch some form of streaming tv on another monitor.  At this point its like watching the universe end while your stuck eternally drifting in space.  I can't do much more than wave as everything goes away. 
---
Would love to play but I’m on PC! PS4 is still on 5.05 (for home brew not piracy!)
---
I've taken 2 friends to launch their first nukes on the queen, and just as my own... Theirs each ended up causing a server disconnect and a waste of a nuke. Haven't played in 3 months bc with the queen being the only endgame content, and being unable to fight her, I don't see the point. 
---
Downside: can’t kill mole rats unless you knock them unconscious and bring them to the overseers camp
---
Report the level 200 for grooming these kids?
---
Very cool seeing the real places. I was just the hotel (in game) this morning. 
---
I think maybe tricentennial is the enclave paint...
---
I don't know about duping and I was not implying anything of the sort. :/
---
We need to be able to walk and spring while in a chair too.
---
Why? 😂
---
I've had a scorched one handing a minigun at me wearing it like a glove, and they dropped a dandy boy apple and a switchblade....
---
Don't buy the recipes. The serums themselves go for anything from free to 200 caps. Pay no more than that.

Cateyes gives -2 prrrception if a radrat or spool of cloth is within visible range.

Do you actually fire your cores?
---
Can*
---
Then rethink how you approach these drops... I use them to hunt over bait. Request a drop, hide close by with chameleon, and then kill the person who comes and picks the lock.
---
&gt;magazine
---
FTFY
---
You screwed up the spoiler.  
---
Cores are pretty worthless. I think Bethesda orignal planed it, that there is a bigger fight on them. Because PA is also not good for PVP (a lot of people told me so, after i cried that survival is broken), it's even more useless. Laser Guns are also not that strong, so a gatling laser is not a weapon that you use all the day. Sure it's very cheap to get cores and use it on a gatling laser. Cheap ammo with a gun that you can just spray. 
---
I got one from an vendor in the mods section
---
Looks like idiots downvoted you for being honest. Have an upvote.
---
You get 3 addictol when completing the guided meditation event. I think you can start it up whenever.
---
Oh i get it 😂
---
I’m seeing a lot of this, where was your camp at? 
---
I check Watoga BOS vendor and both Grafton bots everytime I log in. They're the only places I found them.
---
Sounds interesting 
---
By "take a stimpak" I mean using one, not looting one.
---
Because zero thought was put into this lazy asset flip of a game.
---
The serums work either way.
---
Almost five months and still have the map up. My husband finally started playing like two months ago too so it's proven really useful. Highly recommended.
---
So they didn't fix the server crashes in patch 6 like the patch notes claimed? What a surprise. Glad I haven't wasted my time or bandwidth giving this travesty another shot.
---
Gauss always wins, better damage output with the perks. You vat crit headshots with the gauss your damn near one shorting everyone, especially if you got criticals loaded
---
What does whinge mean?
---
The upper management are clueless to what gamers actually want half the time; just look at the dick head in charge of EA, he doesn't play games if he doesn't have to and only cares about money. 
---
this is actually a really good idea, i don't really like the night vision perk as much because you have to sadly crouch for it to work smh so constantly crouching just to see because it's too dark could get tedious
---
They won't spawn there since a few updates ago, as far as I know you can still find them in random containers or for turning in tech documents
---
Morale check?
---
I only get that slider for a split second whenever I'm spamming both the space bar and the enter button with two fingers each, because I have to craft 500 boiled water so I can then craft the rest of the stuff, which I then shit out onto the floor after eating half of it for no reason.
---
Do you have marsupial and twisted muscles
---
No...but you're putting them *somewhere*...
---
Also being able to see in the dark isn't worth a perk slot in my opinion :)
---
Not if you have starched Gene's lv2 
---
came to say this lol
---
Theres also a spawn in the tree grouping south of the Veiled Sundew Grove in The Bog. 
---
There is not much details on it. All we know is that it is coming later this year. 
---
It’s up to you civilian, you’re brothers and sisters will have your back but if you choose to fly solo on ops that’s your call. 👍
---
Ah, you're right. I'm going to get more coffee, was thinking of the dense mod
---
You don't need to take off Starched Genes when you take the serums.
---
Yes I have them 
---
This is essentially what I currently do but it would be nice anyway more so when it's a moving target
---
Same here. Should hold on to the workshop for players for upto 10 minutes to allow to reconnect to last played server. I stopped doing workshops as almost always dropped out after purchasing and building.
---
Nooo they couldn't cut content... Yet they offer bundled limited edition art work with the same content they put in future within it! That's just fallacy. I won't sit here and scour the internet for you. But there are actual statements in interviews where they talk about ideas in video games that they just didn't have time to add or finish before release. For many games over time.  I mean there's even situations where future content assets are sitting dorment within a released game.(This one i will do the work for you. [https://disclockedcontent.fandom.com/wiki/List\_of\_games\_with\_on-disc\_DLC](https://disclockedcontent.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_games_with_on-disc_DLC))
---
A 60 dollar game now takes in so much more money these days. Why? Because the internet. Back in the toysrus days a game made 30% after cd/cartridge,box manual and shipping and retailers cut. Today most places like steam-xbox will take that 30%. Now of course that doesn't account for retailers today. But the sales are so poor gamestop is going under.  Whens the last time you went to target and saw people in the gaming aisle. Maybe like 2 kids bored waiting for their parents. Not to mention companies themselves are producing their own online stores cutting that cost down even further. Im sure theres a few games like mario or sonic that sold such massive amounts during the dawn of gaming. But 
---
can we please get a emote that says "RESTART YOUR GAME"
---
400 atoms 
---
yeah but if you have enough time to install the mod you might aswell just use discord
---
I don't know that doesn't make a lot of sense, if they were hyping vault raids, but delayed it a month then ok; the vending machines haven't really been hyped so doing something this dumb wouldn't be warranted.
---
Sent request 
---
Look around in Big Al's Tattoo Parlor, the top level before you go through the secret door. There's a receptionist-looking desk that always has an Addictol on one of the lower shelves. If it's not there, someone took it already, just server hop. 
---
eh it didn't cost much and I don't use PER anyway, if it was constantly active without requiring to crouch I feel as though the perk card would be a must at night. If not add that mutation at least make that perk not only active while crouching, would be great 😔
---
I might make a PSA post about this later. I build camps all the time and was testing something last night when I kept getting that same error and knew I shouldn’t. I think I may have figured this problem out. Unfortunately there’s no going back once you get the message (that I’ve found), but this might help with CAMP placement going forward. 
---
What from I’ve tested, it seems to be related to where you place the green C.A.M.P. item within your build area. If it’s in a spot you initially couldn’t place your camp, you can’t later move your C.A.M.P. box to that spot. This happened to me a lot of I placed my camp at the edge near a no build zone but in a green area I could definitely build in, then placed the actual C.A.M.P. item outside of the build area. Hard to describe without seeing it visually. 
---
What I now do is put my camp wherever I can build. Then if I want to move the C.A.M.P. box, I’ll pull up the pipboy first and act like I’m moving my camp by hitting L1. Now just see if that spot is still build appropriate. If it is, cancel the camp moving and you can safely move your C.A.M.P. box there 
---
What are the other 4 on your list?
---
Put points into strength. Thats it. Melee is sooooooo OP in this game. Yeah you could do bloodied but that is annoying and unnecessary as enemies already melt without it. 
---
I wish there was a serum/consumable/perk/helmet that highlighted dead lootable bodies. In tall grass at dusk in the cranberry bog, it's almost impossible to find them if they're far away.
---
This, it’s annoying having to reequip every time.
---
Got You 
---
And entering and exiting my power armor!  So so so annoying! 
---
Not yet 
---
Clarksburg has a chance to spawn lvl 15 raider power armor in a tower on the east side next to the shooting range if your looking for some low lvl armor
---
Which vendor?
---
Holy fuck that'd piss off soooooo many people. I wish they added more bulk options though for the junk like fiberglass and asbestos.
---
People still play this shitty ass game LMAO
---
Report the 200 for harrassment. You did nothing to those kids. Even if you had....it's the game. They can't handle it, they shouldn't be playing it.
---
I don't know if I should be impressed or disappointed
---
As others have said, it's about generating loot in a multiplayer game, but imo it's still unacceptable. 
---
It's possible to know what an enemy carries and pass that to the loot gen table, use that as the base loot, and then generate things like random ammo, some gunpowder, some caps, and in the case of legendaries, more weapons or armor. I don't even know why it would be difficult.
---
I’ve never heard of these , but you’re right , I’ve just looked them up on the wikia😎
---
Nope, serums work regardless of starches Gene's.  Did it yesterday muself.
---
I am not sure either... 
---
I can't believe this is still an issue on a AAA game
---
No, you essentially get a few free shots, but 10-12 shots from a gatling laser/plasma is just a waste of everyone's time.
---
&gt; Haven't played in 3 months bc 
---
Just to be clear, a lot has changed in the 3 months. The rate of DCs is nowhere near what it was in early January and the queen doesn't glitch much anymore.  I can only think of one "flakey " queen fight in the last several weeks and that was on the third nuke in a row. 
---
I totally get that, and stand by what I said. The They are more than welcome to vent their emotional shortcomings on the pvp server. 
---
There are also countless Fallout players who have no desire to be bothered. They enjoy this game for different reasons, and the desire of one person to destroy stuff doesn't trump their desire to be left alone. 
---
The camp-destroing idiots can run amok on the pvp servers. 
---
might be. but check to make sure you have the perks loaded and active... ive been known to switch perks around for crafting .. get distracted and then realize after ive been doing something else ( looking at you SBQ) that ive had my crafting perks on the hole time
---
Seems like crashes and disconnects are happening more frequently since they launched survival. Just last night I d/c twice and crashed to dashboard twice in a span of 2 hours. Once it could have been that I tried to do things before being fully loaded in. But the other 3 it wasn't. Love the game, just frustrated because it had been better. 
---
also love it when i get full on food and water, catch a disconnect, log back in and already down to 50% food and 50% water.. in 30 seconds.
---
I meant world design not graphics but k
---
That's another disheartening angle. Most people don't put any money into microtransactions beyond one or two purchases––they're profitable usually because of, 'whales,' the players with poor impulse control who spend thousands of dollars on microtransactions.
---
&gt;I hope they fix it on Tuesday.
---
Hahahaha, you sweet summer child. This has been an issue since launch, I've simply learned to live with it, because I don't expect it to ever be fixed.
---
Chameleon armor pieces are good most of the time, but depending on them to hide you after you've been spotted isn't the way to use them. Using them to ambush is good, but they also make noise every time you cloak. I was in Morgantown HS and heard a guy cloak before I heard his footsteps. Hiding in darkness/shade/covering bushes beats cloak in most cases.
---
Why would you want it fixed? You can carry extra, I don't see the problem.
---
I just tested artillery on someones base and got 240 bounty. So yeah it’s a maybe
---
Or make the gear you get scale to your level. Level 40? Handmade rifle or LMG with some 5.56. Lvl 100? X-01 PA or fat man hell even ultracite shit.
---
Or be able to recharge them in the fusion generator? I only use 1 wind generator, but if you could recharge cores, I'd use the fusion again.
---
It's standard extra is 100. The extra 100 that happens is a repeatable bug that when you log out. Then in in your excavator you have an extra hundred as long as you don't step out of it. 
---
I’ve got too much adhesive and not enough screws ;-;
---
Many of us are on discord because this games' chat client sucks ass, sometimes you can't hear a person, sometimes they can't hear you, and if on area you can't hear them if you travel, and if on team you can't hear the people on area... so discord. 
---
If you want to meet players, I have a PC discord, it's not really busy but it's not dead either. There's also the filthycasuals discord, it's in the sidebar of that sub and they have a channel for each platform
---
You rip their heads off and it just makes you feel a certain way.
---
I’ve got that perk card where my gun randomly heals itself when I shoot enemies 
---
I've seen a lvl 15 and a 45 there...
---
I can confirm its bugged for me, but no way I could go back to not having it. It is 100% worth it. 
---
Doesnt work on pc 
---
If your Excavator armor has calibrated shocks on both legs the armor should give you an extra 200 lbs. carry weight. 
---
It’s turning games into less something for fun and more just a manipulation program to get people to keep feeding into it. 
---
I didn’t know if the 200 extra carry weight was a bug or if it was supposed to happen and just usually didn’t.
---
You will have to buy the game again, they said that. But I would guess since the game relies on a login that we might be able to use our current account. Could be wrong though.
---
 That is really sad
---
Maybe, but you deserved it for making a base at whitespring
---
omg for sure. I don't know if this started in a recent update, but I don't remember it being like this before...
---
believe me, ive been chasing excavator shocks ever since i got the suit, no luck :(
---
It's been a bug since the start. It's hard not to exploit it to carry more stuff, but it's problematic since you get used to it then there's a fix and everyone cries.
---
If you like, look for calibrated shocks for excavator in the town of Grafton. You can buy the plans for just under 6k and get another 100 carry weight legitimately.
---
Consumable effects (like carry weight from ribeye steak) did transfer between servers until a recent patch. I'm hoping there's a bug and it isn't intentional that they don't anymore.
---
I'm curious, why are you using a wind generator instead of a fusion generator? Don't tell me global warming.
---
So In other words you’re looking for an easy way to play and win? Man you’re gonna hate from software games then 
---
We'd like you to go first in tonight's game. 
---
Just saw the plan for them at the Grafton responders vendor. 
---
They’re young and stupid....unfortunately some don’t grow out of the phase 
---
Yeah, just be level 100+ with an explosive shotgun and you own the server. 
---
It's an issue in more than just this AAA game. Battlefield is full of bugs and issues. Red dead online, be it still in beta, disconnects me all the time
---
I guess we will soon get a First Aid Kit as a "highly requested feature by the community", at 1500 Atoms each that can insta heal all your ailments and top up your heal, and an "Improved First Aid Kit" that will be obtained "for free" that will make you immune to diseases for 10 minutes, dropping at a 0.03% rate from Scorch Beast Queens.
---
Biggest joke is the gatling front sight, decorative purposes only lol
---
The mod is beeing reworked and entered beta testing last wednseday. It works fine I tried it. You're right bout discord, but for having tried the mod, it is really better from ingame.  
---
It is game changer, and indeed I don't understand how bethesda decided not to pull a text-chat coming with base game.
---
I would totally add you if you were on xbox.
---
Sounds awesome! Two past 50 and trying to level a charisma medic now.GT JackTalzin
---
I’ve got 16 for 500 caps. rfxcginnie
---
My base wasn’t at Whitesprings
---
The reload is quick though
---
That's what I'm hoping for, invincible camps.
---
Ah, the way your post was written, you made it sound like your base was there. My apologies
---
You’re not going to get much sympathy here unfortunately after saying you had a camp at whitesprings. That is generally frowned upon...especially if you have turrets. 
---
Is that on pc? I've kept up with the updates and changes as I speak to the guys I used to play with. They say there's been a ton of improvements, but queen nukes still aren't great. 
---
lol wtf? is it not obvious that tons of things have been added to the game? are you gatekeeping having positive opinions about FO76? lmao. 
---
It isn’t even that they get unloaded. They come with a random amount of ammo when you log in. You can end up with an empty mag, or only three bullets will be missing, or thirty. 
---
It doesn’t make any sense. 
---
It happens with ammo as well,  I always make sure my character is well fed and hydrated and guns are reloaded before logging out. Lately when I load back in I'm down to nothing on food and water and my guns are empty...
---
Yeah this isn’t true. 
---
Well why not.  
---
To be honest, I've pulled a nice looking camp right near the Pleasant Valley station at the junkyard.  
---
People that come across randomly give me stuff OO ! its incredible. Someone gave me two mutation serums , another dude gave me a legendary, stimpacks etc :D  
---
people in this game are nice at large. Ok few grievers here and there but at most people are very nice.
---
I’m predominantly a rifle player also and I too have noticed this. Wonder if this was a silent “intended” change with a recent patch... *glares at repair kit announcement*
---
Food has been spoiling faster too as of late... *glares at announcement of fridges down the line*
---
The enclave have access to the X-0. Obviously in fallout 3, the Enclave in D.C improved the X-01 over 200 years.
---
25 years after the bombs dropped, the Enclave in WV just had the prototype on their database, which we can take.
---
I would love to have an assault bot following me around!
---
Yeah I know what you mean. There are just so many shitty parents out there in general. I remember when State of Decay 2 was coming out and some parents were livid there was no option to turn off the swearing for their children. I'm sitting there like are you fucking serious? You are fine letting your children play a game where your character can be graphically ripped apart but it crosses the line when they can hear the word fuck? 
---
Damn, I didn't know that. I guess I just started paying attention to it once it started to negatively affect me.
---
Ya, on PC. I've been playing since the last week of the beta and it is, subjectively,  way more stable now. 
---
The stealth bobble head gets clenched in your buttcheeks. It prevents the clap of your ass from alerting the Scorched. 
---
Man y'all really splitting hairs...so instead of saying, "awesome, this non buffing item will save me a minute of my time" ...y'all acting like this is activating god mode tier and giving you the biggest advantage in the world. How about instead of assuming and causing chaos over something the community asked for...wait for shit to go wrong and then complain....and there is always the dont buy option.
---
I'd guess marsupial, healing factor, carnivore/herbivore can't think of the 5th

Sony announced Playstation will only sell digital games through the playstation store
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/playstation-stops-offering-game-codes-retailers/%3famp
---
IDK if existing codes will still work? I'm thinking they won't
---
Then it’s likely a bug with the specific quest item, I hope there’s a way around it at least if bug fixes is going to take it’s merry time 
---
But only wastelandish outfits pls Not that cartoony shit 
---
I wish the jetpacks actually shot out jet like flames not the ones we have now
---
Cheers for the reply, not sure what you mean by "port forwarding"
---
Because your character tilts the gun when they hold it, the sight isn't anywhere near where the bullet will go (the bullet also leaves from the wrong barrel, but that's another gripe altogether). They literally just need to move the sight 1 barrel over, and it would be perfect (or have your character actually hold it upright, and fire from the proper barrel)
---
Same thing here last night. Complete waste of time, effort, materials and ammo
---
I played from the release till about mid way through January. Since I had a kid I can only binge games, and disconnecting 20+ times a night, getting flare guns and 1 star loot from 3 star enemies, and wasting nukes just got old. Playing an entire weekend and not getting a single useful 3 star despite killing a couple dozen 3 star mobs just made it not seem worthwhile anymore. As soon as more endgame is implemented I plan on returning... But being unable to participate in queen kills made me uninstall. 
---
No thanks. We don't need another long winded post about someone being upset their kid got 'griefed' and someone were all such meanies. Afterall letting your young disabled daughter who cannot handle violence play Fallout is totally normal.
---
Fuck it, I've been considering this for a while, and you've motivated me, I'm doing it now.
---
10.  V.A.T.S zero damage bug.
---
Exists for sneak melee, cant speak for other builds.  If a hit is registered to quickly after entering V.A.T.S., the hit will register (i can see the 3x sneak notification) but apply no damage.  Waiting 2-3 seconds after entering VATS seems to avoid this bug.
---
This really sucks, because 2-3 seconds in V.A.T.S. is an eternity.   I could do a couple 360 spins and still have time to manually mouse over a target in those 2-3 seconds...
---
I run a shotgun and auto rifle build and I have gunsmith 5 on all the time.  I’m deathly afraid of getting into a firefight and my gear busting up.
---
[port forwarding info ](https://portforward.com/fallout-76-connection-issues/) 
---
🙂
---
Buy a fridge only 2000 atoms!
---
Well lucky you ! My ass still hurt from that 3 star super mutant with minigun :(
---
Except 80% of the time, me and my teammate both get disconnected at the same time 
---
Bank those motes!
---
The mod is missing one huge feature: server chat.
---
Sure it has clans etc, but the only real chat options are Global and players within 100m. Global is too populated, 100m is pretty much no one.
---
+5 strength shirt only 800 atoms!
---
Btw this sale only lasts for 15 mins so if u don't have atoms you better buy em!
---
Were there a lot of robots in Whitesprings IRL? Did you grab any golf outfits to sell?
---
That sounds great.  I won't be able to get on for about 4 hours does that work for you?  My gt u1smoothOpr8r what's yours? 
---
Yeah dude.. fucking same - was so stoked to see the patch note that was set to address legendary drops but after 30+ 3 star kills and NEVER getting a 3* ... 
---
I’ve gotten loads of 1 star shit.. but off almost always 3star mobs
---
Very few 2* out of thirty I would say 0 are 3*,
---
2-3 are 2*
---
I must just never see it then. Lately I don't see many nukes except for whitesprings. Must just be me. I also don't server hop to find nukes or anything really. Ruins the game for me.
---
I have marsupial and had to fast travel out. 
---
800 atoms... that’s too poor for my taste
---
How about maybe 10,000 atoms so I can drop some real skrilla on some Raf
---
K 😂😂
---
Rfxcginnie on now and probably later. The flux isn’t going anywhere. 
---
I personally love getting all the way to the end of the silo to launch a nuke and just before the last wave of enemies the server crashes
---
Any form of battlecoat would be fine regardless of faction as long as we get that fine shearling sheepskin longcoat 
---
(Maybe an armored battlecoat set that lets you craft a regular battlecoat over the typical underlinings like the operative underarmor, soldier suit and others, then able to choose whether the wood, leather, metal, combat and scout armor sets could be a visible aesthetic kind of like the UCO mod on Fallout 4
---
P.s. my favourite UCO combination was sturdy metal arms and legs and a heavy leather chest piece over Maxon’s Battlecoat)
---
I built a “camp” and a staircase as close as I could then marsupialed my way to the roof where there is a drop in. There are also an outcropping in the side I could not get to. 
---
How exactly do you decrypt the codes?
---
yeah man today alone i got like all 1 star and a couple did not drop anything, i wonder if its due to one shot kills?
---
The treasure is inside you. 
---
I wonder if the third person mode allows the dot to appear when aiming?
---
The speed at which they’ll toss a grenade always shocks me. I saw one come from behind a building last night and I swear he must have tossed it from behind the building!
---
I'd say less than 50 pct of my 3* legendary mobs drop 3* stuff. Not to mention often it isn't max level. Even off max level ghouls in whitesprings. 
---
I cried laughing at this. 
---
I used to do this in the vertibird in fallout 4!
---
:O I'm shocked, I'll update the info and guess I'll dropping the data in. 
---
Noticed that too, when I run up one something that just spawned and I 1 shot it, it seems to drop some wonky shit.. like yesterday killing scorched I got multiple regular scorched that I seen spawn and killed fast and was getting as an example
---
2 duplicated broken hunting rifles
---
random ammo, like 6 .45, 3 2mm, 4 2mm explosive, etc
---
I’m not sure what’s going on with this shit but it’s pretty annoying..
---
I still haven’t seen anything solidifying if luck or something is affecting my shit drops (only run 5 luck)
---
If the server crash, you wont be able to return to it no matter what...
---
very true
---
Seems like the beam splitter broke my laser rifle way faster.  But that was before the energy weapon buff. Seemed like the beta tuner was bugged.
---
Oh I getcha, yeah I'm a non power armor build but didn't really base mine off any specific build. Running without power armor will be much better than with for pvp.
---
God i just hate it when the lock pick crash comes after claiming one of the fusion cores work shops 
---
My rifles are working fine, they last a while even without the 200% repair, now my double barrel shotgun used to break pretty fast but now that use that luck perk that repair you stuff when you hit things, I almost don't need to repair my shotgun anymore...
---
I hotswitch between two a lot and it’s really irritating. If you manually select the two, the game will “remember” for a while, but it’ll forget even if you don’t fast travel
---
K thanks
---
Yeah, shocked at the BOS Sheilded Lining, Its not dropped for me yet. I'm updating the post to reflect it. 
---
Thanks, I'll update the post. 
---
I love this community. Cant wait to watch this!
---
All it would change is some minor minutia. A couple of minor convenience items won't change what you can do in the game. It won't help you get better gear or kill anything faster. It would be nice to just have them in the game normally, but not having them won't my game any different. Plus Atom is easy to get for free. 
---
Buy this power armor paint job and each member of your team who has it gives you +50 damage resistance, this sale ends in 10 minutes 
---
They said rhey would put them in but after the backlash there maybe hope. But no they are not in the game
---
He/she literally got so upset over a post, they literally went to litter styrofoam. Oddly enough foam plastics were just outlawed in my area.
---
***I won't forget the day /u/PM_TITS_and_LOCATION decided to litter foam plastic over a post on the internet, then brag about it on the internet.***
---
I am a lucky bastard, my monitor can put up a crosshair for me, works like a charm. But this needs to be fixed.
---
Pc gamer quotes this in an article FYI 
---
I've tried both the splitter and the focuser in an automatic laser rifle.  Honestly, the focuser was the winner due to increased deterioration and split damage between the 4 beams with the splitter. Of course, YMMV.
---
I personally don't see them backing out on this one. I don't think you'll get a definitive answer until the update. Even then, if the Feedback is bad enough they may remove them again. 
---
"Repair Kits are our first attempt at a utility item like this, and we plan to make adjustments based on your feedback, so we hope you'll share your thoughts with us when they go live later this month."
---
but was it efficent in mid/close combat? good damage? easy hit without aiming? do damage becomes higher the closest is the range as for balistic shotguns?
---
206 down 68 up. Nice try though you garbage can.
---
Really? Do you have a proof? Haven't heard that yet. 
---
You are shooting in the center of your screen, it's not hard to figure it out.
---
Yeah I've had multiple CTD's as well, also times when the entire game will just freeze for no apparent reason and I can't even bring up task manager to force close the game. 
---
It's like a love hate relationship with this game honestly. 
---
I can confirm that I just did it this afternoon (2019/04/07) and I didn't find a single desk fan or antique globe. Tons of battered clipboards though.
---
I know we only need 2 more motes to summon, and that I have 13 on me, but first I realllly want to invade with nothing but primary ammo. That's cool right?
---
Feel free to submit a trivia question to be asked of one of tonight's players. Maybe your question will be the difference, literally, between life and death. 
---
Mostly black and maroon, I like it over the original yellow and black.
---
I live this idea!
---
lol that post was so strange
---
We should each be able to add items and caps to what we are offering, and once both parties are done, each side has to confirm the trade. 
---
But then again that has so many points of failure. They’d need to work in protections for people trying to change the trade at the last second. 
---
For me helping a lower level player clean out site Alpha so he/she could launch their first nuke and then just before the end i got disconected. The sad part for me is not being able to share the joy of that firts launch. 
---
It would be nice if only for a stop gao measure they let us pre-build workshop scematics and keep the resources similar to camps. So if we get disconnected we can just call up the scematic and not waste extra resources.
---
Hope you're enjoying!
---
DnD term. It means they got "scared". Which was rather funny because I didn't think that robots could get scared and run. 
---
Long story short: was in Watoga. Shot out two robots. The third turned around and started running away. Killed it. Turned the corner and two Protectrons were shooting two other PCs. They spotted me and started running as well. Weird times. 
---
Hey I know this is 15 days late 😂 but I don’t think sentinel has even been found yet. My self I have all the paint from Initiate to elder but I still don’t have sentinel. It was found in the dev room on pc so I assume it’s obtainable 
---
Man, yesterday for me was *rough*.  Just to give a rundown:
---
* Spontaneous disconnect.
---
* Sound completely cuts out, have to restart.
---
* Freeze myself with Cryolator during SBQ battle, have to kill myself to fix because the effect is bugged.
---
* Crash during SBQ battle.
---
I did get a Bloodied Gatling Gun out of it though...
---
is the same for plasma splitter?
---
No it was "A fallout 76 update has removed your base" but what I think it was, Is I was to close to a future underground preexisting dungeon that we dont have access to yet...its cool i just wish the gane told you that its a resteicted area BEFORE putting a lot of time into building 
---
Can't really remember.  It should be miles better now with the buffs
---
No sense keeping so many cores. Just dump a bunch, it's pretty easy to take Poseidon, power it up and hold it. Also you can wear the power armor frame on it's own and it'll give you the resistance bonuses as well as losing the 10lbs from your inventory usage that it weighs while you're wearing it. 
---
I started farming whitesprings and keeping every 2-3* legendary I found
---
My stash was full in a week after I cleared everything else in there out
---
They wanted to prevent people from server hopping a disease off 
---
Hey if thats what the free market sets the price as.
---
What perks and what level are you? 
---
Hope someone will give use more details ;)
---
shitty coding and lazy design. 
---
I'd be interested. I'm level 114 gamertag is MaizeScarnut
---
As far as I am able to explain it, the cards show up once you have picked enough cards for that level.  I have the same issue with my Heavy Weapons build.  I won't have all the cards I need till I am 65
---
And the market is free to go play something else. The system works. 
---
Im level 30 but have over 10 levels saved for rifleman perks starched genes and some others
---
Oh my god look a legendary switchblade in the dirty toxic water I must get it
---
*Pressed e
---
*Drinks water
---
Fuck
---
While they are at it, can they also add a few more mods to the .50 cal? It's my favourite heavy gun but it only has 1 mod(yeah I'm not counting the prime receiver)
---
I agree.  Like I said, by placing such weird restrictions on this stuff, which were probably intended to force players to build in more plausible ways, it actually promotes the complete opposite because no one wants to deal with it.
---
Foundations are one example.  Other things like not being able to have half walls "floating," the weird restrictions on non-foundation floor placement, the rotation of interior versus exterior wall snapping - it's not random, it pains me that someone actually put thought into these bizarre rules.
---
As a heavy gunner: never had an issue with that. If you really, *really* have a hard time landing your shots without an on-screen aiming helper, you can always switch to third person, there's a targeting indicator there at all times.
---
This ruins my plan i dont want to waste my levels on useless perks has it always been like this?
---
I've seem people complaining about text spam in other similar posts... Once i had to complete the Fasnacht event while listening to NSync because some guy had it playing in his room. I also did while some guy was having a fight with someone else...  
---
"Yeah, you can just mute the guy"  
---
Yup, and the same applies for text chat!  
---
We need text chat ASAP!  
---
Fallout 76 is all about "Fallout with friends" but i can't make friends because i can't communicate with them... (no, i cannot use i mic)
---
I hadn't noticed it during PvE much, and I mained a heavy with long reload times. But, had the stealthy drop on my first PvP encounter in Survival to test my assassins flamer that I modded to the hilt, I pulled the trigger and nothing.... Dead as doornail due to the misfire. Twas a formative experience that helped me grow up. Now I will never forget to reload again.
---
Yes, Incisor is an absolute must for any melee build. 
---
Despite it all, I love the game and I'm just off after playing for a few hours. 
---
Rn jus look for players in that server, go to recent, and join game 
---
No clue. I haven't tried out plasma weapons yet bc they're not hitscan.
---
Just find the blueprint, then build a bunch of low level ones with super duper and scrap them
---
Seems like everyone I talked to yesterday was having major server crash issues. I had a few servers crash even when there weren’t any nukes on the server. 
---
Nope, have a bunch of skins for the most useless weapon - knife.
---
Don't question it too hard until it starts shooting bullets.
---
I laugh when I saw the pink castle bed
---
Now I want it. This is sad
---
I'm surprised it hasn't yet, I'll have to see if I can load it, it would be like the ballistic first from NV
---
It is not negated by its own weight. 
---
Also you can use raider power armor starting at level 15
---
yeah its always been like this
---
you have to level into cards. so if youre level 30 but you have 10 points saved your card level is still lvl 20. your level 30 card wont appear until you spend that level 30 point. 
---
forces you to pick cards that you dont need for your build to finally get to the card you need. best thing i can tell you to do, is level you stat you need to level anyways but pick a card you know you will need.. 
---
for example put 1 point in strength, then key over to intelligence and pick up another gunsmith card to level up gunsmith. you dont have to buy a card where you bought the stat point if you didnt know that.
---
I think loadouts would just workout easier for them then trying to reprogram passive.  Although i do agree though.
---
Ok cool. I’ll message you 
---
There is no pacifist in survival mode.
---
Yeah, here, at least for the last three points, the server was still running because I was able to rejoin friends.  The sound cutting out was new to Patch 7 and has happened a couple times before.  The Cryolator freezing the user is something I've mentioned before, but haven't gotten any comment from Bethesda about.  Basically, it applies a slow-mo state on the player that seems to have no end.  Even if you kill yourself, you'll still glow blue like you have the effect, so that whole thing is just broken.
---
The game is screaming for end game content right now 
---
I caught your sarcasm 
---
I would be doing the same thing but I never see nuke zones anymore
---
Been there! Ugh!
---
Ammosmith and Chemist 
---
Yeah someone at bethesda has actualky been paid to put these restrictions in the game, and im guessing it was by someone who never or rarely ever builds anything other then a square
---
Ok :)
---
I believe dcg has best dmg but considering bot can get up to 2k dmg it doesnt really matter which you use
---
And make them shared loot again, not instanced.  I hate that they made these drops exclusive to whoever gets there first, it should be shared to encourage more people doing them.  You know, a social thing like the game should have more.
---
:)
---
Lots of theories...  1-they remember the proud tradition of dumping on every fallout, and are passing the torch, 2- the fans think this will improve the game, not kill it (sometimes right, sometimes wrong) 3-this happens to every game because no game is perfect and has legit flaws, you just notice more when its yours, 4-it is really cheap to hire a troll farm brigade (see European and US election, can cost 10-100k to get huge internet presence), and competing games are trying to bring each other down
---
I would say it is a little bit of all...  some legit fans who just always complain (1&amp;3), some are trying to improve things(2), and some negative advertising from competitors(4).  Can be hard to tell which is which, so just trust your gut if you like the game, and try to keep your voice in the fray but not lose your mind.
---
And add plans to the loot pool 
---
I could spend a long time trying to explain it but honestly, I would probably just confuse you. thankfully SaukPuhpat has actually made a step by step guide on how to do it because he's a legend! 
---

Good luck!
---
I have GTX 1060 And intel core i5 7500 and 16gb of ram and this game is abysmally slow. I use all low graphics with textures on medium.
---
And why does everything under level 40 drop a pipe pistol 
---
I have a lot of radiums that I have to share between my toons, I have considered this long and hard! 
---
If you have an Nvidia card, try updating to the latest drivers and uninstalling all the other non-driver stuff that comes with it.  It helped stability on my machine.
---
Honestly, if they start putting shit in the atom shop that affects actual gameplay beyond cosmetics I'm just going to uninstall and not look back. I have dropped maybe an extra $20-$25 in the shop on top of the $60 I paid for the game, since I've got around 200 hours in it I feel like that's not too crazy and that I've gotten roughly my money's worth when they're not accidentally rolling back updates and shit, but there won't be another dime or minute spent if they start using the atom shop in EA-like ways and putting in shit that actually affects gameplay mechanics and costs atoms like these repair kits, as opposed to something that people have been asking for like a free-to-download fridge plan so our food doesn't spoil at such an insanely moronic speed. 
---
If it's a repair kit plan that costs zero atoms? Fine, that's rad. If it's a repair kit itself that costs atoms that you have to buy over and over again? Oh HELL no. Bye bye, see you later.
---
People wanted a Fallout game were you could kill kids and face the consequences but it turns out it’s a far more annoying hassle than anyone could have predicted.
---
I see it about once a day. 
---
Typical libertarian...hey wait a minute.
---
**Porcupine**
---
\+Enemies that get too close to you take significant bleed damage. 
---
\- Equipped armor loses durability overtime (Class Freak slows down the degradation)
---
**My version of Plague Walker**
---
\+ Poison Aura that scales with number of diseases. Does enough damage to actually be meaningful. Negative effects of diseases are 75% weaker.
---
\- Diseases last 50% longer and cannot be cured with items (Unaffected by Class Freak)
---
**Chemical Blood**
---
\+Chems are 50% stronger.
---
\- Much higher chance of addiction. Withdrawal effects are three times worse. Addictions cannot be cured with items. (Class Freak reduces the addiction chance and severity of the withdraw effects).
---
I remember back when they had that Well Rested week, Well Rested stopped carrying over from one play to the next.
---
I've had this glitched for a week. I've tried everything suggested and everything else and the quest won't clear. I also can't get more BIV quests. It sucks.
---
Power Armor negates any bonuses from armor or underarmor that you're wearing. There are mods for your power armor that increase strength, carry weight etc that you can find and add, but that's about it. This includes legendary bonuses, ie. chameleon armor will not work when you're in power armor.
---
Maybe it's intentionaly a way to limit server hops.
---
Not sure if a lot have seen the problem where legendary mobs are dropping syringers and drills instead of legendaries but I have been seeing this occur more often 
---
I’m down. GT is BALL STR33T
---
It's just happening constantly. I've never really had it this bad until now. But thanks for the response 
---
I've been trying to get the dense mod for a few weeks now with no luck.
---
If only that part of the market would go play something else....   
---
Cool ideas :o I think chemical blood should be 100% stronger for 3x worse withdrawal effects tho 
---
I'm not sure if creatures do this. Deathclaws certainly don't
---
as much as I don't like the epic games fiascos, at least it is coming to steam eventually, and apparently is also available on win10 store if you want to use it immediately. Personally, I'ma just wait for the steam release. 
---
it sucks because 3* are rare enough especially on a full server then you kill one and either get nothing or it is a 1*star maybe 2* but rarely a 3* at max level. wtf haha
---
Or if they removed all weapon benches in the game...
---
And even after those 10 minutes if no one has taken the workshop why not let you reclaim it for free at least?
---
I've been playing the last month. Definitely many improvements, lots of bug and exploit fixes. Still a fair number, but not unplayable. I've found it enjoyable enough to keep playing at this point. 
---
Great idea but instigating wouldn’t have been ideal because players are rarely at absolute full health
---
I understand the spam and the toxicity concerns people have about text chat but theres always the option to mute people or disable it and never have to see it again. On PC text chat is a MUST HAVE for online games like these.
---
Sweet! Hopefully I’ll be able to join in time!!!
---
Login is worse. I'd say queen loot and such things hardly lagg at all nowdays for me at least, and slap damage was finally removed.
---
Those stars aren't for his drops. ***The're the souls of those who fell to his roasts.***
---
I think we can safely assume they've gotten the feedback.  What else are they going to say?
---
Best comment I saw the other day: 
---
every 3* is a legendary insult bot when it drops an instigating pool cue or a drill
---
Limitation of an online game not maintaining a local cache to prevent tampering and exploitation of game world would be my guess. 
---
Requiring everything to be loaded afresh from the server will depend on the LAN and WAN route to server resources and may cause significant lag.
---
This is just a guess on my part.
---
Gotcha i had to pick some cards i didnt need but its worth to get to where i need to be thanks for the explanation i thought it was different
---
Third person. While aiming you get a dot.
---
you dont have to remove starched genes to add in mutations, ive never removed sg when adding new mutations on 3 different characters.  
---
sg only keeps you from gaining new mutations for the environment (rad farming and so on) or accidently removing them from using radaway. serums bypass sg and are unaffected by it.
---
I’ve got a pretty basic base and that takes quite a bit of time to load in. I’ve noticed that it seems to take longer since the last couple of updates.  Maybe just a coincidence.
---
Depends on what you call improvement.  In terms of quests, there's only been the one real addition (Fasnacht doesn't count).  Many events are still flaky.
---
Stability varies from patch to patch.  I'd say that Patch 6 was the best stability we've had, but Patch 7 was a mess as far as I'm concerned.  I can't honestly say that the game is more stable now than it was back in November because of that.
---
lol or a 3 star friggin berserker lol
---
Climate change.
---
Especially with Speed Demon.
---
Haven't heard of 1. I'm down tho. 
---
Ah actually I didn't have a targeting hud on my helmet, but your suggestion gave me an idea. After I stepped out of my power armor, the problem went away... Interesting. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Lmao god rolls SS and +Str on a berserkers wood board lol
---
Nobody talks about the real negative from speed demon; if you move while a stimpak is active the slower regen buff gets eaten up in seconds.
---
I've never seen it from turning in tech documents. 
---
But we're too dummy thicc to sneak past them most of the time. All that time spent in the Vault really added mass..
---
Because *EVERYONE* uses the sledge and leather armor 
---
lmfao
---
https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-76-PC/dp/B07DDD9VK7?th=1
---
"Extra" keys aren't really a thing, and if they are, they aren't going to be free. 
---
As a heavy build, the best advice I have is either Get level 1 pacify, or an exploding gatling plasma.
---
Game Show Gauntlet. Fun.
---
Ah - for some reason I thought underarmor was specifically for wearing under PA.  So instead, it's another way to improve non power armor builds?
---
Depends a lot on the server.  It's not a bad way to ascertain how "healthy" a server is.  If your CAMP loads relatively quickly, that's a good omen.
---
I’d be up for that GT is DerpyNerd155
---
Eh, I farm it without nukes. still yields 3-4 legendaries for me per run
---
This has happened to me once.  Spawned right as the nuke was apparently detonating.  It took me a few seconds to realize what was happening as the screen was just white.  Always something fun in the wasteland.
---
I killed about a dozen mothmen when doing savage divide maps and ha e only seen 3 flat wood monsters in 600 hours
---
Boy, I got so many questions wrong on that quest
---
Mostly because they ask several Fallout 3 questions in addition to questions about 4
---
The Trinity Tower question was pretty funny, though
---
"Who was trapped on the top of Trinity Tower?"
---
"Bill Sutton"
---
"I have no idea who that is. So...Lose Your Head!"
---
Watch out for those windmills. I hear the noise from them causes cancer 😀
---
*Bang* *bang*
---
i would love to appear off line :/ my friend list drives me crazy. im not playing becous of it
---
I have about 160 hours and have only seen the Mothman once, never seen the Flatwoods Monster :(
---
Happens for gath laser/plasma, equipped or not. Each time I pull those out I have to reload.  
---
Has started to happen with my .50 machine gun too now. After first spawn 000 bullets in the gun. 
---
I have seen mothman twice in the past week as a spawn where the first responder bot can be by Charleston Station. One time it was even the middle of the day. 
---
10,000 caps!!!!
---
Post this request in fallout filthy casual too will get you a few members.
---
I don't know what is with the  fallout community but its like some of you are  uncle tom to capitalists get my wallet out for anything blah blah blah. Of course we want to pay for dlc ive been paying for it since warcraft 2. Hell i  bought all the content from 3, new vegas and even spent the 200 on a fallout  4 pip boy edition .  Ive bought the building bundles for 4 even though i mod the hell out of the game. I own 4 copies of the old series now between original,steam,mini nuke and free download. I have a NCR hoodie,2beer cups,some wall art and  three t-shirts. Fallout is my god damn mantra. They are making money like they have an in utero feeding tube to my bank account. 
---
I do have a problem shelling out hundreds of dollars on  a concept used on games i play on the toilet with my phone though. P2W isn't for me man.
---
AAA company not making money. What are you saying they have released zero data on sales. I guess i can give some examples of how to make cash on a pay to play. 1...pay to play. Here's some more. For example I guess opening an atom store and shoving in items people want at a fair price with compromising integrity. Or you can start gouging your long term user base until you lose them but hook some  kids who don't really have a concept of money,rackets and gambling dressed up as loot crates. Maybe a few loyals like myself will shell out a  little. I know i bought $40 worth just to bolster the low build options and unwillingness to do some of the job like  atom dailies. I hate myself for doing it though as i feel like i didn't get my moneys worth. SO yeah i guess sleazy money tactics is one way and they even work to an extent. This ones destroying my trust and making me look outwards to similar games with a better system.  
---
Short version.
---
You know this thread has a large list of atom store products they would be willing to buy. Most of them are assests from fallout4 or things we can see in game untapped the market. So id say start with that for money.  Instead the choice to manipulate the market and whore out repair kits which was and may continue to be nerfed by them is a low blow to people clinging on to the fallout teet. 
---
Bloodied unarmed.
---
Seen the flatwood monster twice in the toxic valley and once in the savagr divide. If you see purple or orange enemy or blasts that should be him
---
so its not just me... i feel... *validated*. i am a heavy weapons class. got bear arms going. power user. batteries included. all the heavy gun cards. bandoleer. a mass array of high output armaments. im a walking war crime. but dont let me swap a weapon... i can practically hear the benny hill as i fumble through the touchy ass weapon wheel selector, pick the wrong weapon a couple times, think i got a good thing going with the gatling plasma or laser, just to realize i need to reload all the while getting smacked and diseased by mook as ghouls.
---
thats why the gatling gun and 50. cal mg stay on hotswap. i can trust them. ...*more so*.
---
Returning to last sever? Sounds like somebody is doing the duping! But seriously, they probably removed or didn't add that, because 95% of all duping methods involved server manipulation with static objects and crashing your client. That's probably why they will never add it.
---
Nice try but wrong game.
---
Pretty much.
---
😂 it’s not the wrong game. You can turn it off. 
---
As far as I know the Deathclaw Gauntlet has a base dmg of 55, and the Power Fist is 58, level 50
---
I've noticed that when I load in, people are already inside my very own base, and using the crafting benches before I can even move or even see my camp. It's funny watching people floating in mid air and swinging a hammer while the base loads in a bit at a time. If I jump up to where they are, I fall to the ground.
---
There are several. Just search Reddit for "fallout discord" you will find several to choose from. The one in in doesn't allow me to create an invite, otherwise I'd post it here. I found it through the sub.
---
SOrry I believe it was from one of the railroad vendors... can't remember which one.
---
It's under the mat in front of the door.
---
All excellent ideas especially the locking of favourites. I’ve lost quite a few things by mistake while playing.
---
The social ideas seem like they could be fun but would require these areas to have  a universal truce.
---
You can find a wise mothman if you do the event at the light house (path to enlightenment). It can be very difficult to do alone though.
---
You're not, but never fear avid consumer, for Bethesda is adding repair kits to the atom store soon.  
---
Praise be to atom, we are saved.
---
Usually I can grab at least one person by saying I have radsponge to share, but yeah having to use a gameplay mechanic for an unintended reason instead of there just being a direct solution for that is a bit annoying.
---
Ok cool 
---
Because Bethesda is extremely lazy when it comes to fixing even minor things that most developers would get done in a day
---
I killed the moth man 7 times last night, it spawns by lady Janet’s soft serve which is a spot I hop on for cwr and the vendor bot, flatwoods monster spawns outside my camp on the lake se of Fred’s bbq
---
Hard drive speeds effect this. SSD users load significantly faster. I load in about 10 seconds with dual nVME SSDs. 
---
I plan to get an SSD but it seems like it just needed some tweaking with the settings. Its a shame I have to run it in potato mode. I looked up a YouTube video to see the benefit of an SSD in open world games such as Fallout 4 among others and it does get rid of the microstuttering but for Fallout 76, it seems that the only benefit is load times. I figure that the game gets choppy when trying to register events across the map as its online and what other players do matters to an extent. My CPU has an even load across all 4 cores and OC'ing it doesn't seem to change anything other than making it run cooler by \~10 degrees Celsius. Yeah it was just 5,400; I took an external drive I used for my xbox and installed it in my PC because I didn't want to clutter my OS drive with games given that its a standard 7,200 RPM hitachi drive. 
---
At the rate this game is performing on my rig though, I don't think I'll be able to do a SBQ fight without my PC overheating since I'm using a stock cooler, which would also make watercooling a planned upgrade for the future.  
---
for some reason that makes me want a Severed-Scorch-Arm-Holding-A-Machete as an Axe weapon skin...
---
Damn, that's a pretty good setup and it still doesn't run like a AAA game should? This is actually sad.
---
Nice, I'll have to keep that in mind 
---
What animal escaped from the West Tek Lab in Fallout 1?
---
What was the location name for West Tek in Fallout 1?
---
What is the final challenge in the Temple of Trials in Fallout 2?
---
According to the Fallout Bible what is the fate of Dogmeat from Fallout 1?
---
The biggest thing I look for when playing a PC game is performance and they cut around it it seems.
---
Do you mean survival mode? 
---
There was a hole in the roof. He had to jump on something and then jump out I think. 
---
His YouTube channel always starts with a cartoon dwarf opening up a dungeon door, but I can't remember his GD name.
---
Unfortunately, that event is the only reason I've ever seen a Mothman :( Thanks for the suggestion though!
---
Unacceptable?   Um.... ok.  So a legendary Wendigo attacking with screams and claws while wearing a loin cloth should drop what?  A +1 CHR crotch armor?
---
The RNG rolls are far better thean whatever they are actually using, so I'm cool with that.
---
I found one after continual hopping for about a week and a half. The bad thing is, I got 5 marine, 2 trapper, 2 robot, and 3 leather dense mods in that same time. Combat seems to be the rarer one. 
---
You get the plans from turning in Technical Data at Camp Venture after joining the Brotherhood of Steel. 
---
See when vending machines ever comes around I am toying around with offering/advertising free fauschnut donuts. 
---
PRAISE ATOM!
---
This is a long overdue vital feature we need; along with locking items so we don't accidentally scrap/sell and Fast Travel Mats for Camps.
---
The user doesn’t even know what they are complaining about.  Just wants to complain.  
---
FML
---
Don’t give them ideas. 
---
And not to mention a rude and inappropriate way to name the headline. 
---
Happy birthday, sir! 🥳
---
It's not a fire axe. It's the new Fire axe machete skin in the Atomic Shop. Only 1200 atoms. 
---
Ya, dudes can walk into and event without fast travelling and kill you over and over again. Survival mode is trash. I only play it for the legendary weapons.....then head back to adventure mode. I can't afford to lose 300 plus caps when I get popped.
---
Doesn’t appear to work on any brew station crafts.  
---
Honestly I just join a server with someone on my friends list, find an out of the way static container that can hold unlimited items (not all can) dump them in there and hold my breath and hope for stability as I switch characters and join the same game again.  
---
So far have had one loss of maybe 30+ swaps, and it has certainly made my enjoyment of the game higher as I rarely have true “wasted” drops, and I have ammo, glorious ammo (well except heavy gunner, nothing can keep up with that).
---
Unfortunately real friends I could trust holding items have all left.  Work with what you’ve got!
---
The SBQ fight isn't a "use whatever you want lol that lead pipe will really drain its health" fight. It's not debatable; Energy and Heavy weapons are still weaker in comparison to say rifles or other weapons. If you're gonna use an energy weapon, especially in the "final boss fight" you need to make sure it's being used properly. Strange words coming from someone named "TheMetaKing".
---
YES!  I remember someone saying it had to do with a fix to stop dupers.  But yes...  now I always have to "pat my coat pockets" after a loading screen to make sure I have my back up ready and haven't lost my "gloves."
---
In that case I've found a guitar sword that was second best in damage. And you can use it in power armor.
---
robbin
---
At least one point in Conc Fire is a must for VATS headshots. Otherwise you can only target the body. I like it maxed at 3 because of its increased accuracy &amp; damage output.
---
I still do manual sniping without VATS so having one point in sniper helps steady aiming. 
---
Lol don't carry things you don't want to lose. Easy I have over 100 stims and rad chems safely waiting for my injured ass
---
There are adults that act like that tho.
---
There have been a ton of topics so far about aid loss in survival. Since you are just piling on to what everyone else has said about this poorly thought out garbage, you should have known this going in. Event protection only works for/against people that are in the event. This is true in adventure too.
---
0/10 sympathy for you dying and losing all your chems just so you could make a gripe post when you should have known better.
---
Are they nonlegendary?  I believe the duping fix also cause hotswap issues with the legendaries.  Let us know... I might switch to a buffed nonlegendary as emergency back up then.
---
If you are on x bone I can sell you a  BOS one.
---
The annoying Alcohol dailies made me realize this recently and it makes me sad. :(
---
For example; yesterday I only had 1 Ant Lager and don't have the recipe so I couldn't respawn the ants to kill 5 by channel hopping so I didn't finish it.
---
Oh they already have the ideas alright. 
---
1. Hostility isint needed I'm just trying to be positive. 
---
2. Energy weapons do more.damage against the queen then most ballistic weapons.
---
And 3. The queen is not even that hard. If the man wants to use a lead pipe let him use it who cares. 
---
Joined and can see you launched a min ago
---
Agreed, there's literally no reason to sit down at all right now.
---
They'd be useful if i could call in all 50 of my tapes at once and shotgun them at flatwoods, hopefully killing 2-3 people
---
You can see it in the atom shop. 
---
 I'm about 50/50 Mothman and Flatwoods so far. The Flatwoods Monster is out there but will just disappear at the drop of a hat. I know what he sounds like and Stealth out immediately and can usually get him. He needs to be overwhelmed when you attack, or he's gone .
---
i did the other day over in the mire.. finally got that challenge done to kill all the "special" guys
---
Nice collection, here's mine! :) https://imgur.com/a/Qikn2qm
---
I can't tell if this is bait...
---
?  No it wasn't.  It happened about a  month ago.  A quick google search shows that.
---
I’ve caught a glance at a flat woods monster but really couldn’t see anything but something glowing and then the game labeled it for me when I scoped it. It disappeared soon as I shot so I still don’t know what it looks like. 
---
use all night long with it
---
Can someone tag the community managers for this 
---
I'd be +1 for more radstorms.
---
They already can based upon the area that the drop is in
---
"I don't care if this BETA test is meant to work out the very issues I'm complaining about! BGS should have been able to predict all of these problems."
---
Hahas.
---
I am at work but always up to help ps4. Tal0nkyl0r
---
Ps I'm lonely and wanna adventure with others
---
You have clearly never tried a bloody ranged build, it is quite effective if you have the correct gear. Unyielding still helps with more PER (VATS accuracy), AGI (action points), and LCK (pretty much everything in the game). If a player is rocking a ranged Unyielding build, then Bloodied+Explosive is the best combo to have on a shotgun. Instigating+Explosive is very effective while playing solo, but is still really only better than Bloodied if you're able to 1- or 2-shot enemies. Which yeah, I can do that with pretty much everything super mutant-sized and smaller. But while playing with friends, Instigating becomes much less useful because Instigating requires you get the first hit on every enemy you attack. Unless, of course, your friends also have Instigating+Explosive shotguns....
---
If you reload and server jump or enter a new area, it loses the info that you reloaded.  I always reload and check my hotswap after loading screen.
---
Not to mention the cost in aid has been discussed at length, and brining your entire supply of chems is just stupid planning.
---
How about instead of a workaround we ask them to fix the base issue? 
---
I'm not sure why you're being so sensitive. The kids were enjoying the game. ... Not bothering you. 
---
Some higher level player, maybe a dad or older brother, asks you to stay away. 
---
The correct response is to say "OK. Sorry. Wasn't trying to bother them." Then continue doing whatever you were doing with your team. 
---
Seems like you are just as fragile as you're making out the kids to be. 
---
Thanks, I really only started having this opinion recently with the release of Blades. So much inventory management with how little storage they give you unless you pay by using gems or whatever. They also don't give you as much for playing as other mobile games do. 
---
Not sure this would be the case unless our game worlds are in fact held in a local cache. I’d love to find definitive information on this subject.
---
I have an SSD dedicated to FO76 and sometimes my camp loads like a slug always.
---
I’m in queue. 
---
Leader of the pack and wolf horde are two seperate events. The end of one just triggers the other. Horde events in general have about a 50ish percent change to have a legendary boss. 
---
Yeah, totally random. I've seen him in the wild 4 times. 3x in the forest (he likes to visit my camp) and once in the savage divide. I actually saw him the day I left the vault!
---
Seen the Flatwoods monster twice; once in the forest (again, near my camp) and once in the toxic valley, just south of the space station. And fyi, my camp is up the hill from the overseer's camp, a little bit closer to the highway that goes by Sutton. It gets attacked by random enemies constantly. I built it there day one, and I'm too lazy to move it.
---
That's stupid. The 200 didn't harass anyone. The OP is just a whiny baby. I have seen people here claim that they have a right to level random camps to the ground, because the like it. This guy just asked that the OP go on his way. 
---
I mostly meant that if you're going unyielding/bloodied you may as well go melee because it will benefit more
---
I haven't seen ANY of the dense mods, so you're doing better than me.
---
76 megatons of caps
---
Never have any of these issues on PS4
---
Also, carry lots of things you dont care to lose.  I think if you have 10 stimpacks and 100 dirty waters or spoiled items, it's going to drop less stimpacks.  That's been my experience. 
---
I could see some comedy value if it did :P
---
Thank you!
---
THIRD CLAW OPTION?!?!
---
If you have a friend who has finished the game, have them make you the BoS Recon rifle. It doesn't cost them much it mats and you can get a new one every 10 levels for more damage. I've gone through 4 of em on my way to lvl 50 and the recon scope is so nice for solo sniping.
---
Agreed, I don't even pick them up anymore. I won't waste my time going to the site to use them, then waste more time travelling half way across the map to get it (seriously, why can't it just drop where you requested it?), just to find some basic, low-level weapon/gear, and maybe some food or water (it's been so long I honestly don't remember what they drop). So why bother letting then clutter up my inventory?
---
I was thinking the same thing lol did I just eat that 😂
---
“We hear you. But just don’t care”
---
Yeah, you haven't seen that?
---
Greenhouse gases do not equal radiation...
---
Reminds me of Diablo 2's mosquito swarms dropping heavy plate mail :D
---
High level bloodied melee build. Tired of raiding and my original group has taken a hiatus until the fall.
---
GT: DunwichCultist
---
It certainly has some risk involved for sure.
---
But having a more barter/trade type system could increase trading and the building of a community type feel.
---
Right now the trade system is built on trust....
---
I know, right?!?!
---
What are iguana bits made out of?
---
Just finished the quest, I'm on still though and would be down to play!
---
Shhhh
---
Everyone's all up in arms about this controversy.... Because it's a baby step towards pay to win.....
---
I think BGS is simply testing the waters to monetize some of the most mundane aspects of the game that have so little impact that they fall closer to a cosmetic/convenience than p2w. 
---
I get being worried, but creating outrage based on an assumption about what lies down the road is a bit much. Be worried, then outraged when they offer true P2W options. 
---
Ahh the internet, where most things can be answered with "Up your butt" 
---
They're in.
---
From what I've read the shop ones are advanced and they're adding regular ones to loot tables.
---
Yeah, I'm waiting patiently for the ability to rename our stuff.  I can see collecting complete sets of armor and giving away to lower levels but its too much of a hassle right now to sort through my T-60, T-45, T-51, Raider, X-01, Ultracite and a couple more frames (that hold alternate pieces).
---
I was lucky enough to get the Adrenal plan in a SQ fight.  I've been making the serum and giving to random lower levels and dropping a serum (and unwanted Legendaries) in the WS Railway blue luggage stash.  Paying it forward for all the help I've gotten including the brown baggies with unwanted goodies in front of the golf club during a nuke event.
---
(Hitting my 25,000 cap now so thinking about buying the Marsupial or Speed plans and giving away those serums)
---
Looking forward to see how Player Vending works.  I can see placing my CAMP close by the Overseer and giving most of my stuff away on the cheap.  
---
This still hasn’t been fixed?
---
Okay I thought you truly didn't know that, cuz I've seen some stupid people on a lot of gaming subreddits ask for stuff like that
---
I doubt they'll do that due to duping fears.
---
Watoga train station and the BoS one at the super duper mart can sell it. 
---
Can you read? That's not at all what I said. 
---
Yeah, they're wondrous for photo mode
---
Yeah I've seen a couple of those too lol
---
Very little has been fixed.
---
I was thinking "oh god not only are they stupid their a tree hugger too"
---
If you want to play in steam, you are going to have to buy game again- This what they told in Twitter when some one asked, if they have to buy game again.
---
Bring a new meaning to trading them hmmm your face is dirty but the rest of u is clean and u want to trade a little man I can stick in me bum....
---
I just wanted to drop by and say how the hell does my guy in full power armor get bit by a ghoul 1 time and get bone worms? I could see if i was running around naked.
---
I’m interested in what you mean by that.  Though I know know that duping has increased the volume of valuable items in the community, but these items are being sold already.
---
How would have a reading option compound that issue?
---
Except Bethesda is Karen.
---
Also should mention i play at 2560x1440. Oops!
---
Is she dead or should I stay in queue?
---
I’m having this issue with the paired keycard 3 - I’ve hopped servers a dozen times and it’s not spawning in the safe 
---
I don't think it exists. There are some weapons like the junk jet, compound bow, etc that were in the files since launch but can't actually be found. Pretty sure even the dev room didn't have them
---
We will be using this question tonight, thanks to you. A shout out will be given in your honor, Hivemind56.
---
Only to fetuses
---
That's not the issue though. I have more than 20 disease cures but some diseases I don't mind waiting out. The problem is that the positive effects from consumables disappear when you leave the game even if you have an hour left of those effects.
---
Let's say it's some young teens, who are playing and obeying their parents and not getting on the mic with anyone.
---
Let's say the level 200 is an older friend or their dad, and he drops by and tells you to beat it or he's going to come one shot your whole team and take your workshop, along with some of his friends. Would that make this more acceptable?
---
The guy just politely asked you to leave. 
---
Stop whining every time something doesn't go your way. The 200 didn't do anything to you and the kids didn't do anything to you. 
---
If you climbed around in my place uninvited and wouldn't take off, I know quite a few people who would gladly hop servers to come chase you off. I personally think pvp is stupid, but I also think if you're playing, you don't go into someone's camp uninvoted without risking consequences. 
---
Please PM us the answer to your 4th question, and we will be using it in tonight's event. Look for your shout-out on our Twitch stream during the show.
---
Thanks it should have been additive or multiplicative (like a mechanical advantage). Both make sense to mind either the chassis provides mechanical leverage or the power source drives some motors with a fixed max torque (additive advantage)
---
No just no.... they gave him a fix ...
---
Yeah, the only problem with this is that the plans seem to be impossible to place.
---
Bethesda pls fix
---
Haven't tried other heavies but with the harpoon gun I've found it's better to enter 3rd person and use that "sight". TONS more accurate and better vision than the gun's actual sight. 
---
Maybe they were RPing too hard..
---
Rile 34

Which enemy faction from fallout 4 has assultrons?(gunners)

What was the flaw in the masters plan from fallout 1?(super mutants are sterile)
---
Which game was the flamer introduced in? (Fallout 1)
---
What was the name of the masters cult in fallout 1?( Children of the cathedral)
---
In version 1.0 of fallout 1, how many days did you have before mutants attack the vault, if you tell the water caravans about the vault.
---
Traditionally games with duping problems do it via player to player item trading.
---
At least now duping isn't something everyone can do. 
---
Of course they could implement a system that can't be exploited but i don't have much faith in then actually doing that.
---
Since I have the perk to make them last 2 hours... It just means my anal cavity desolves the boy in twice the amount of time!
---
Is your special spread the same? Also tank killer doesn't deal more damage, just ignores more armor.
---
thats where i found mine, it jump scared me so badly 
---
I find it annoying that there's so much pre-war money in those drops.  But I also think it's hilarious that the government is literally dropping money on the problem and hopes it will fix it.
---
The game needs a lot more groups like this guarding the wasteland (I would join, but I'm on PC).
---
Camp plans are sellable.  Oh- you mean like a blueprint?  That’s a cool idea!
---
Could be both. You ought to get a reward for completing an event, but they just need to fix the queen issue. I think the challenge is just that queen events are so huge, with so many independent creatures and drops that it strains the system to its limit. 
---
I don't know if it's a coding issue or some sort of server-side memory issue, but i'm guessing they have had teams working on this for a while now. 
---
Getting rid of the doopers was helpful, but obviously didn't fully solve the issue. 
---
Mutations, also where he shoots versus where you shoot. Also armour raiting on whatever your shooting. Idk how in depth of an analysis you did but you still have a few unaccounted factors that are messing up your numbers.
---
Yea lol, I always laugh when I see those types of posts
---
Excited to watch!! Can’t wait til it happens on Xbox also!!
---
The shitty practice is suddenly deciding that a bunch of regular items are actually going to be limited-time months after they were released. Good luck earning the atoms needed to buy all those items in a week by just playing the game.
---
Your HOA will be using the Master's cult question tonight. You will receive credit, and glory.
---
I dont think alot of people would agree with "free to play" I could Bet you they'd up and quit.
---
I only server hopped back when the Fasnacht event was active so I could play it as often as I could.
---
My issue is that when I'm done playing for the night and hop back on the next day, I'm still suffering from a disease but the positive effects from the meals I cooked were no longer active even though they still had more than 10 minutes left on the timer. 
---
I consumed a bobblehead once and had an hour left of its effects, and got kicked from a server not long afterwards and the effects were gone once I logged back in.
---
Adventure is almost perfect now as a PvE world. A lot of kids that play games don't have a sense of what's fair or not. 
---
Hell I met a kid who didn't know survival was pvp, he thought it was just a hard mode according to the YouTube videos he saw. If they can't process this information, why are they playing?
---
I laugh then shudder in pain
---
My first spot was on lead/junk deposit in toxic valley- it was good place for mid game as I needed lead and all kinds for junk to build PA and such.
---
Now my camp is on acid deposit- So far it is the best spot for late game, because...1) it is other side of the map away from Vault 76, means I am spending way less on traveling. 2) Acid is key to easy bullets. Lead and Iron aren't that much of a problem if you find out the correct build/equipment to use when making them. 3) Natural resources around you- meat, water, wood. 4) No scorchebeasts near the camp. 5) train station 1 cap away
---
They said fridge at the end of this weeks ITV. Now you know as much as we do.
---
no one cares about your sympathy. survival mode is dumb and there prob can't be enough posts about it.
---
It's the other way round.
---
BETA is an excuse to release garbage.
---
So nothing has been revealed yet?
---
Yeah not really into ESO I like elder scrolls but ESO feels more like 3d diablo than skyrim. Problem is I got low level gear someone can benefit from but they aren't on reddit or in the discord. 
---
It just works.
---
Yeah I wouldn’t appreciate free to play, I often feel at high pop and with already little content it’s already way too crowded
---
I couldn’t imagine the amount of capital they’d need to invest to consider making that sort of population jump.. 
---
We could sell our creations yes !
---
I have a legendary main and non legendary swap and it removes my swap weapon everytime I change into/out of PA or travel into a building or fast travel.
---
I get diseases quickly because I don't have the perk that prevents my chances of contracting a disease. Also, radaways increase your chance of getting a disease and I'm almost always using them.
---
I don't mind catching diseases though because I always have the Pharma Farma perk card equipped so I have more disease cures and antibiotics than I can even use.
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
Kill fireflies.
---
I've seen mothman in the wild near Huntersville more often then anywhere else.  I used to have my base just up the hill from the broken overpass on the right hand side of the road just before the graves.   This was before the Mothman event, about 3 months ago.
---
I used to encounter mothman as I started on the road to go down hill, across the broken overpass, and then the straight stretch after the sharp right turn.  I would meet mothman along that stretch.   Over a month of playing I had about 3 to 4 encounters.
---
Do you play the game? Or are you just a lurker. We're coming up to the 8th major update, and there is a roadmap for continued updates therefore suggesting they haven't given up on the game.  
---
I'm on there every day, and every day I see new players come into the world.  I'm sure there are people that would love to believe the game is dead and Bethesda don't care, but that's just not the case at all.
---
Coming to an Atom Shop near you for the low, low price of 20,000 Atoms!
---
are they? I havn't even seen any yet I thought that came out tuesday?
---
Yeah this is really too bad 
---
Modus blessed me with a extra jetpack mod the other day, have it nicely stashed away, never used or even opened the box, just send me a msg what you think is a fair price :)
---
Are you set up with the right cards and gear to counter the E factor?  U using the dense chest mod?
---
Healing factor + Medics handmade/combat/assault rifle, only need stimpacks for healing crippled limbs.
---
There is a simple trick that works (sometimes) when a vendor has 0 caps, simply try to sell him something for 1 cap, it will show 0 on his end, but a second later he will restock to 200 caps. I've done this countless times, but it only works occasionally.
---
Yeah but I mean the loading of my base inside the world that is already loaded
---
I might do this just to get rid of the 40 weight in Fluorescent flux in my stash box. Thanks for the idea!
---
Complaining about getting killed in Survival is hilarious. If you don't want to die, don't be on the Survival server?
---
Global Warming is a myth.
---
Any truth to the rumor that Explosive will be buffed to around 60% soon?  
---
How about being able to load up multiple drop requests in order to improve the quality of what is dropped (like if you use up 20 of the supply drop requests you get 1 2-star item guaranteed)
---
They'd probably have to increase server capacity and get IMPROVE the server stability. I hope it doesn't get to free to play though.
---
Yes sometimes it hurts to laugh lol
---
Ok so I did a log of Legendary farming and I figured out its not just Legendaries that do this. It specifically Sentient type creatures, Super Mutants, Scorched, a few others like gulpers. Not Robots or Ghouls. They don't have to be Legendary. 
---
If one of these mobs is nonlegendary but is carrying a legendary they will act just the same. "RUN AWAY!" 
---
I was bale to see this behavior over and over. Ches down the non legendary who flee and guess what, they were holding lol. 
---
So it seems to be any sentient to semi sentient creature who has a legendary on them will flee. 
---
The bugs lies with the Item in the inventory and how the AI handles that, not the title. 
---
It doesnt seem to effect creatures like Snallygasters, Wolves, Instects, Mirelurk ect. Or Ghouls and Robots. 
---
If you spend several hours over a few days visiting only the areas legendary mobs spawn with non legendary mobs, specifically the sentient and smeisentient you can reproduce my findings. 
---
Wow, I'm stupid. I don't know how I put west coast instead of east coast, but I somehow did
---
Sent out. Have a good show.
---
people really need to re-read that part they didnt say the fridges and other things were coming to atom shop they said other community ideas like fridges ect... 
---
Oh shit, that's even better
---
Damn. I was literally about to make this same post. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE. 
---
Yeah you could get out by jumping on to tiny ledges and all of that but ain’t nobody got time for that.
---
Alright dude, I’m about as maxed out as you can get.
---
Dense, around +400 DR, Fireproof 3, dodgy, I run a cav/sentinel-Assassin mix (3-2), lone wanderer, serendipity. I also have cola-nut 2 on and pop quantum’s to run through it, but it still kills me.
---
Not everyone, but some of those guns to crazy dmg 
---
If it does go free-to-play undemanding my money back
---
I think the greenskins in 76 are weaker and less fierce than in 4 but I figured that's because they're still "fresh" and the commonwealth ones have been around for years
---
You aren't made for competitive PVP mmo. You have no idea what you're talking about and what you want simply isn't what this kind of game will be. Period. I'm sorry. Play a match based shooter. 
---
That's cool and all, but what about placing said blueprints? For example, my CAMP is built inside a cave. If I made a plan of it and sold it, the person buying it would have my exact set up, and unless he built it in the exact same cave, he/she would have floating structures everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love this idea. There's been some amazing CAMP's I would love to copy ideas from, but how would this work so once placed, the person wouldn't have to go around their CAMP to clear away unwanted structures?
---
I'm not sure my character could pull off [this look](https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/supremes).
---
I’d say replace lone wanderer with dodgy and suppressor
---
Without a subscription service, something like this is bound to happen. And it should. Otherwise we won't get updates. 
---
And baby ducks
---
Very nice balanced melee build. Started a similar melee build recently, but with more focus on stealth and less damage resistance. You can sacrifice some damage resistance points for something like Adrenaline, otherwise your build looks good to me.
---
I no longer have this issue. I’ve more or less quit playing that game since this post. Keep saying I’ll play again, but it’s been over 3 months. 
---
Fallout 4 didn't have any shoe slot for armors because cosmetic outfits weren't a thing then. I doubt they'll do it because it would require fundamentally changing the way apparels work in the game.
---
You madame or sir, are a genius! 
---
You’re right i didn’t think about that 
---
If someone offered me 3k atom caps to make up for making this game free I'd tell them to fuck their own hat
---
started in patch 7 for me on pc several friends if not all also got it
---
100% agree. 
---
I don't think Bethesda really supports alternative characters mostly because it has been abused
---
They could even put this in the Enclave bunker (maybe in the Command Wing).
---
You can still get into the Bunker pretty quickly if you know where to go so it wouldn't be too much of an inconvenience.  And it would prevent abuse from people who would just create a new rule character.  You can still use this for a mule, you'd just have to put some effort in.
---
I for one fully support this idea and will throw hundreds if not thousands of dollars at it if this is implemented
---
I don't mean I see less damage in combat, I mean when we trade, we see different damage numbers for the same rifle.
---
For mutations I have adrenal reaction, marsupial, healing factor, chameleon, bird bones, grounded, carnivore, and speed demon.  I also have maxed starched genes and maxed class freak perks.
---
Both of you unequip all of your cards, log out. Log back in and reequip them all. Then retest. 
---
The lone reader/listener
---
Just get some junkies weapons and roll with it. 
---
I'm very happy with the outfit I'm wearing but these could be really nice additions.
---
Yeah but you can’t actually make a character in survival. So anyone you see in survival isn’t really new. 
---
I can imagine a group  of dwellers wandering Appalachia looking like that lol
---
If you kill fireflies, the Mothman will hunt you down. 
---
Go to the Hunters Shack in the Mire and do the repeatable Queen of the Hunt quest. You’ll get the Flatwoods Monster eventually.
---
maybe maybe not
---
They don't care. They'll take their quarterly bonuses and when they can see the end is near, load the company up with debt and then golden parachute out to do it all again.
---
Cant you just aim for the middle of your screen?
---
No, really. I'm not being sarcastic.
---
My shotgun can refill my whole health bar in a couple shots
---
Great idea. It shouldn't be impossible to implement especially that we have the option of returning to our team's server.
---
I have like 100 of those tapes waiting for a reason to use them.
---
The rebuilder
---
The server failing/dying and disconnecting everyone is a separate issue
---
He was a pretty good offensive lineman for the Bears that sometimes played running back in short yardage situations.
---
you will loos it, to learn silencer for one type of weapon you will need to craft the weapon and scrap it, over and over until you get it, silencer is often the last mod you will learn..
---
 How many possible endings are in Fallout New Vegas?
---
No, if you remove the silencer you will not learn how to craft it. If you scrap the weapon you have a chance of obtaining the recipe for the silencer but chances are you wont and you'll be sad
---
Never seen one, approaching 400 hours. 
---
My Vault Dweller is Ashton Garvey. Decorated police officer with three bravery awards. Seeing the dilapidated state of the world, and people barely managing to survive, he wants to start a group that will help people rebuild, and provide safety against Appalachian threats. A group that will protect people at a minute's notice. In his favorite garb: a Western Duster and a Ranger Hat from his pre-war days, Ashton goes around helping people build CAMPS and start farms. Wanted to move to the Commonwealth after retirement but the War happened.

---
If those posts had actual ideas, then I agree. The posts that suggest a few more fast travel points, or a suggestion on how to better implement aid drop are what we need. Not more posts of "this game mode is poop."
---
I like this one, thanks
---
Great Idea!  We'll add this feature to the Atom Store for purchase momentarily. -Bethesda 
---
I’ve never been more confused in my entire life 
---
You mean 10k atoms it's like 10 pounds for 1000 atoms.
---
The mission you go through when you stumble across the camp and then are forced to go through it again to access the brotherhood elevator?
---
grr.
---
Guessing you are coming back from not playing in a while and used a mod or two in the past. Delete you custom ini file you created for the mod list and it will work fine.
---
And I've had mothmen attack me rather frequently, including once or twice teaming up with a damned Flatwoods monster
---
think i scrapped 20 handmades before i had all the mods :)
---
A great football player, nicknamed the fridge.
---
1* gets bagged quick or Vendored
---
The Pioneer
---
I feel the opposite about handmades. I repair to 200%, play my entire session and it’s at 150%
---
Atta boy, keep em sheltered so they won't know how to handle anything when it comes!
---
&gt;no one cares about your sympathy. survival mode is dumb and there prob can't be enough posts about it.
---
Yes, true, but anyone who speaks up about it can only expect to get down voted to oblivion here and 90 percent of the feedback will come from sycophants defending the game.   The people who gave 76 a chance, saw it was a broken mess, then gave it second, third and fourth chances have finally given up and moved on. 
---
You probably are just too young to get the joke. There was a player for the Bears named William Perry and his nickname was the fridge.
---
Yeah, since one troll can ruin a good thing. I just wish we didn’t have to designa game that way. 
---
The Witcher 3, GTA V, Just Cause 3, the Far Crys,and hell even Metro Exodus have huge detailed worlds with not even a fraction of the problems 76 has. 
---
The Waster
---
I would do the same because I pre ordered the tricentennial edition of the game and I regret not canceling it in the beta because I was like " It will be all fixed before launch" and I was very wrong
---
The Reclaimer
---
OMG, it's you, been around apalatcia i while, seen your work, shame on you :D
---
And I'm gonna check lol
---
All the springs.
---
Our rifle-related perks are the same, both of us have all 3 rifleman perks maxed.
---
Rarely from other vendors, sure. From the atom store, no.
---
A server repair kit perhaps?
---
Thank you all for the help
---
Its drops from Events though. It's not like Stims are in short supply. You just have to look for them
---
It’s funny that the proprietary power armor isn’t already Garrahan branded.
---
That's kinda weird.. I haven't install any mod for fallout 76 and I plays it almost everyday :P
---
yeah, at one time there was suddenly a "vacuum" inside Sugar grove, lol :)
---
Did the same with the Gauss rifle, same thing, last mod learn'd was the silencer :/
---
What did you find a cave? All the caves ive seen are already marked as location.
---
What I end up doing nowadays is bulking all my stuff and going around and giving them to younger players if they want it, simple stuff like ammo, aid, mats, etc. 
---
My challenges are bugged for the location, it says to locate so and so, but I have and I am able to fast travel to them on the map but my challenges won't update so I have about 5 that are glitched.
---
Also nice collection :) 
---
Don't buy ammo! Craft it!
---
I run a hospital south of Morgantown, free healthcare for Appalachia! - SnipingSmalley on xb1
---
Who was the inventor of Jet?
---
Which village from Fallout 1 is later known as the capital of the NCR?
---
Who is the religious group that started in Megaton?
---
What happened to Joshua Graham after the First Battle of Hoover Dam?
---
Who is responsible for Super Mutants in the Commonwealth?
---
Even if they couldn't add fully interchangeable shoe slots, they could at least give you recolors on an outfit. Buy Sequin Dress at regular price, upgrade/unlock Sequin Dress with black shoes for another 60 Atoms.
---
They could also simply hire me as a shoe consultant to make sure the original outfit shoes have some kind of bearing on the rest of the outfit.
---
Yeah there are lots of ways to heal , was more so thinking about pvp and born survivor, still worth having though.
---
Yup, I am indeed running said perk. Makes life a lot easier. I'm sad that perks don't apply within stashes, but I understand the balance point for it 
---
And drugs and drinking!
---
But at least there's no smoking!
---
Sure it does
---
I found one in the Enclave vendor area along with a Radaway recipe. YMMV
---
same for me. i got a mix of vanilla and legendaries. doesnt matter, im losing the hot swap. 
---
Sounds like we both like to do some community service then. :)
---
Unscorched
---
Sadly I am on PC so I will not be able to help you.. sorry :/. I would if I could 
---
My only way around this is have someone on thw team so if I lose it they get the claim at workshops 
---
100% agree OP. 
---
If they don't care, they wouldn't be completely silence.
---
It is one of the way to express that they care but nothing is final at this point yet. They just need time to discuss and replan.
---
Are you guys at the same health? Adrenal effects weapon damage. Also is your friend wearing unyielding gear?
---
I wonder stand that, I am just saying the negative stuff would go too but they dont want you server hoping if that was the case.
---
&gt;BETA is an excuse to release garbage
---
While giving those using it some feeling of exclusivity/ elitism ("I played it  there first!")
---
You can buy the stimpack recipe from the Whitespring Bunker medical vendor. Is costs ~1000 caps (maybe less if you chem it up). It requires blood packs, antiseptic and steel to craft.
---
I spend 60 bucks on after launch, I know that isn't anywhere near as close to the tricentennial Edition but 60 bucks is 60 bucks
---
I always thought my friend liked using bobbleheads a lot, now I know why 
---
I know just poking fun. 
---
I’ll be on that at that time and would be down to help. GT EvilBrad3884 just shoot me a message when you’re getting ready to start. 
---
Enclave medical wing can sell you those plans. i got my stimpak. rad away, and most of my other chem plans there
---
How is this possible ur base appears when u log in
---
Nice, what was your method? The distressed effect looks pretty good. 
---
except the globe is in fact cooling 🤮
---
If you put what it is and what platform your on there’s a good chance you could find someone to do it for you. There are some very nice people on here despite the fact that we complain a lot. 
---
/u/Valseek

---
I got a metal chest piece off a friend last night that had 100 something ballistic reduction. I might be missing something but that was higher than my Vanguard BOS heavy chest
---
Unfortunately nobody can control who shows up so the point is kinda mute. It wasnt a problem killing it.
---
Rather caps have a greater value so it would still be an option
---
Yes and now that you have seen my work and know my intentions fear me and spread word of my dubious actions!
---
Yuri the Wombat
---
Probably that. Or maybe because I’m English and don’t know a thing about American football 
---
This is survival mode beta where they are accepting changes. If beta suggestions aren't for you, you probably shouldn't be here.
---
I just got the BOS IV but I never got III.  
---
We're both at least 80%+ health.  Neither of us in unyielding armor.
---
It is associated with Bethesda, even tangentially, and therefore glitchy.  Merely uttering the B-word causes issues.  
---
Otherwise yes, get some Post-It action on the screen. Use a gun with crosshairs to get it lined up and you are more golden then you already are. 
---
If u wanna flex u just gotta get the jumpsuits..supreme is mad corny now anyway
---
In just gonna guess you're gonna be able to buy a "basic" fridge plan from the atomic shop but an "improved" one can drop as a rare reward from endgame quests.
---
lol :D
---
Yes they are.
---
Mate you on pc? I'll sell you stims. 10c each
---
Same on PS4
---
You drop a bunch of aid items on death in Survival mode.  It is intentional 
---
Mageirocovore:  you gain 2x benefits from all pre packaged food, no benefits from meat or veggies (and a corresponding elimination of their benefits for pre packaged food).  Mageirocophobia is fear of cooking before people have to look it up.
---
Vendors should rarely have it. The Atom Shop should never have it. 
---
Machete? Wtf are they holding a Gatling Plasma and then dropping a sickle? 😄
---
Not even relevant to the point. Its about giving players a few seconds to get their rewards they helped earn. 
---
By your logic events in survival mode should be ffa damage wise also.
---
I haven’t had any luck getting it from events. Do you know which ones are more likely to drop it?
---
Thats an awesome idea :o
---
Weirdly I don't know that I've ever gotten an incorrect ranged weapon drop from a scorched, whatever they shoot they seem to drop.  But melee has always been a different story.  But for other mob types it's a lot more consistent even for melee, super mutants for instance.
---
I imagine it's just a bug with how the loot tables are setup right now.
---
Read please. Its survival mode. Slap damage does not exist.
---
The hoarder or the wasteland cook lol 
---
One of Many? The Same Ones. The Equals. Commons... Because you know...  every player is doin the same Storyline simultaneously and saves the world somehow like every other Dweller. Oh... wow like a  Swarm intelligence! I never thought of that like this before. This game is about a Battle between two Swarm intelligences!
---
I'm not trying to pick a fight with people who server hop. I try not to but I understand why people do. That said, whilst there is so much server hopping going on, server problems should be expected. Its down to BGS to do something about drop rates and provide enough opportunities for good loot encounters. But, Its also up to the players not to take the @!ss so much. 
---
I’ve had it drop like 3 times from Census Violence in Cranberry Bog.
---
My base can take 1 to 2 mins to fully load in for me after I appear, and I'm usually in high traffic areas like train stations (whitespring). So when I load into a map, I can sometimes see people using my stuff while I'm still loading in, and textures are appearing.. usually during that whole freezing and stuttering stage. Its weird that they can see/use my camp before I can.
---
Legion
---
lol you didnt read that at all did you?
---
The guy who is always short on materials, stocks them up, does a quest and is short on materials again. So... the lone wandering mobius string
---
If you were to gather up everyone who has asked for free shit and/or special privileges in PvP modes of Fallout, and lay them out across the FO76 map, how may times greater than the map would said stack be? 
---
I don't understand weapon damage at all. People talk about doing hundreds or even thousands of points of damage per shot. 
---
At Fasnacht I picked up some over-leveled gear that I cannot use for a long time, and the damage is about the same as the same kind of stuff that I picked up at level 10. 
---
What makes a 50 point damage rifle into something that does thousands of points of damage? Or are there weapons with much much higher base damage and I just have not found them yet? 
---
It still takes me 3x shotgun rounds to put down a level 3 ghoul so I am wondering how I am ever gonna contribute to killing the SBQ!
---
I’ve always though the women’s dress shoes were pretty 50s accurate, which, yes, is hideous.
---
I know this has been a long time since u posted this, but can I ask where this is located ?
---
Thing is my screen is big and I sit close and can't see the sides clearly so the middle isn't that obvious
---
I have to reload my weapon everytime I load into a new server. 
---
Better than killing it and the corpse falls thru the map 😓😅
---
There are cabins and lodges all over so the model is already in game.  👍👍
---
I think these Community manager people  probably are not allowed to talk yet, but for sure they all have seen the backslash. At the end of the day they are just the messenger of Bethesda and they act the way they are told to act...
---
I had to do the same daily quest 3 times because it kept crashing and I'd lose all progress.   That is super frustrating
---
My son made it for me. It's a heat transfer. Ink reversed on paper, heat transfer to the shirt. Yeah, he worked hard to get the distressed look just right. 
---
That's some communist shit right there.
---
My buddy and I are unable to add each other as friends by typing each other's names in. The friend requests are never sent. Irritating. 
---
Doing the last part of the brotherhood of steel quest I fought off 3 Bravos before getting into the caverns, about 1/3 of the way through my TSE gatling gun broke. The fully I picked up a decent legendary assault rifle along the way, between that and my homemade I made it through. 
---
Basically aside from longer quests like that to crazy boss battles there isn't much of a need for them. What I would like to see is a "nimble" hands mod/perk that allows you to use the crafting stations while in PA
---
In FO4, one YouTuber did a bunch of tests and found that the order in which you acquired your perks affected how they stacked. There were sometimes drastic differences between the same perks combos.
---
Next time you test this, add your cards back in the same order. 
---
I'm glad I came to check out Reddit before playing again lol Have they fixed the carry weight at all? It was annoying having to go through your inventory every ten min or so and try to decide what you should drop.
---
Happens to me constantly 😡
---
I’m not convinced.  All of the ideas listed (ammo conversions, junk right to stash, unspoiling food, repair kits) seem to be convenience based items going against the grain of the “Vision” Bethesda seems to have of this game.  That is, these are pay for convenience items.  Though as a one time atom fee, I can certainly earn those if really want them.
---
No. Just no. 
---
I’m a big fan, been playing the game at least a little bit just about every day since launch. I would stop playing and never look back. 
---
The predatory mechanics necessary to make a F2P game profitable are disgusting—and Bethesda employs all of them in Elder Scrolls Blades. They’d do the same thing here.
---
If they need to change the free vs paid atom balance (and I’m sure they do) they can do that easily. Take at least half of the current challenges and change the rewards to things like repair kits, super stims, rare components etc. Create big challenges to award things like CAMP refrigerators and ammo converters, diverting focus from the atom based challenges. This will stop the bleeding and allow them to intro more compelling cosmetics.
---
Players have large balances of free atoms. I’ve gotten everything I want from the atom shop, two accidental purchases as well, and I’ve never been close to needed to buy atoms. No one I play with has ever purchased atoms either. It’s definitely a problem they need to solve. Going F2P isn’t the way. 
---
Yeah its become habit to me everytime i load in to hit reload immediately.. equip second weapon, make sure its loaded, then get food and water back on point before i even make a move..
---
Go so tired of hittting second weapon only to throw up fists cause my toon evidently forgot she carried a second weapon for 9 hours the day before.
---
Stop with your gatekeeping bs. It's not called "People that haved luck with RNG - Mode". They can make such a mode but also for players that didn't had luck on rgn (or paid money). 
---
Put up a post. I'm sure somebody can sell you it. But in my 700 hours, I've only ever crafted Stims if I happen to have the supplies on hand, usually for vendor runs. They're so abundant in the world that I can't really justify needing the recipe
---
Yes, they're made out of a delicious and perfectly edible plastic like mache substance that can be flavored. 
---
They always use vehicles as their shells also in fo4 far harbor.
---
i have a collection. never used one.
---
Can we just go ahead and rename that stealth bobble the Ant-Man bobble in that case?
---
Nevermind that, who let you out of your locked quarters ya old coot
---
Thanks I will definitely have to keep an eye out for it
---
But take more damage from canines
---
I have been swung or dived at, been completely missed (untouched)and still gotten a disease.
---
I make shirts too, please emote thumbs up at him for me!
---
Estelle 
---
And if they bring back giving your weapons names she would be carrying around 
---
-Bea Arthur (her silenced .45 cal sniper rifle)
---
-Betty White (her recon silenced piercing. 50 cal sniper rifle)
---
And
---
-Rue (her Dragon, because you know its loud, does a lot of damage but attracts too much attention)
---
I've noticed a lot more diversity to the plans I've been finding too, so I'm thinking something might have been tweaked in the last patch but since they didn't list it in detailed notes, it's purely anecdotal til they confirm
---
Thanks for sharing, this is great info! Have you by any chance tested with a weapon that has the +15% critical refill legendary effect to see if that can take you from a 2-1 cycle to a 1-1 cycle before you get to 34 luck? 
---
Fair enough argument.  I can see your point.  Finding exploits and cheering are thing I stay away from, so some of this duping issues are new to me.
---
The Scrapper
---
I have a TSE gatling gun and I can clearly see 2 bullets while In PA
---
I know is not like is hard to kill them cause I one shot them is the principle you know
---
It's not the fix we want or need, but if you go to social menu and find the name of someone that was in thebfight with you, click join game, and you should join right back, unless the entire server died.
---
Psn.

Keep up the good work. 
---
Flex required. Where is the location of such jumpsuit?
---
Do you have a C:\Users\jacob\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76\Fallout76Custom.ini from something else?
---
Check and see if that file exists, if so, delete it or rename it.
---
No, no I have not. Is it unlocked via scrapping? 
---
I don't find many DCG lying around
---
They do, but I have found that not everyone has or wants caps.
---
Then if must trust that you will get what they say they are offering.
---
More realistic suggestion- real clothing system
---
Aka shoes shirts pants etc.
---
Mix n match
---
lol yeah I had that feel, except I was playing Friday the 13th and over the voice chat, a couple of 10 year olds (maybe, how the hell would I know) were griefing people with Jason and demanding they speak to them in voice chat. When I started attacking one of the not Jason players, they started screaming and calling everyone the n word. So my take there is that if you're fine with letting your kid play a super gory rated M game while they're screaming the n word at strangers online, they're okay getting beaten in said game. 
---
Should have killed that guy and razed their C.A.M.P. to prove a point. 
---
This is the only logical response. 
---
I'd be very interested in finding out but as is all I can say is spam the messenger in the savage divide!
---
The ultraflex is the whitespring , forest camo and BOS jumpsuits..all expensive and rare but once u see them u will kno what I mean..check out the market subs
---
And a one moment please.
---
I'm shocked how little people care about what exactly they're buying, but then I remember that they don't care what the kid is playing as long as they are quiet, out of the way and don't bother the parents. They'd buy a popular game about being a serial killer eating your victims if it meant a little peace and quiet. 
---
That may be the best case scenario... Cause we’re all just walking wallets.
---
I got mine pretty early in the game but rarley can craft them but i got enough through normal gameplay. Selling it at the Atomic Shop is a no go. They should rather make it a gurantee drop for some quest or so, like every other item that is kinda a key item. 
---
This is still a problem!? I haven’t played in months but I figured they would have addressed at least that...
---
Da Bears!!!
---
To do this bethesda would need to take off the clipping from items and allow us to place anywhere.  
---
I dont care if i place my pre built structure and i cant access a room because it is now underground, maybe i like the look of it like that
---
Make a list of what to grab and get them while exploring. Eventually you'll have more than what you need. Since I actively started picking up for screws and springs I now have almost 400 of each. 
---
Problem is once you get the items and mods you will need very little moving forward. My plan now is to keep 200 of rare items (screws, springs, etc) 100 of everything else (except acid, lead and steel). So I can still craft ammo and bullets.
---
A hungry, Overcucumbered, and, thirsty boi.
---
I already bought some plus i dont like wasting the energy on it. Easier to buy it and get back to playing. 
---
If I told you that, and you built in the same cave, should we ever be in the game together at the same time, one of us ain't getting their CAMP, LoL. I'm kidding, I don't care. I'll just go to another server. It's in the mountains northeast of the Abandoned Ammo Factory, the workshop with the machine you can make ammo from. There are 2 entrances. The lower entrance is on the south face of the mountains while the second entrance is up on the rocks on the west face.
---
I haven't killed a sbq since tse nerf and I'm 210 lol. Got tied of wasting ammo and armour damage. Good job!
---
Theres loads of unmarked caves to build in
---
Not really, There are laws for a reason. Laws prevent the child from buying the game on their own because of the Adult nature of the product, why should this be able to be any different then if an adult would buy cigarettes or beer for a underage person. 
---
They're not dumb. They don't care what the kids are playing because every second they're shooting mutants in Appalachia they're not bothering the parents and noticing when they keep drinking that smelly red stuff in the fancy bottle. It's an in house babysitter. 
---
"But it's a great perk!"
---
"It *is* a great perk, Phil, but we just can't call it 'Savoring Anus."
---
Get this man an award.
---
I often find them in the bunker and white springs 
---
If they make this F2P I’m out. That’s not what I signed up for.
---
NPCs aren't real people, why does it matter if the thing that gives you a quest is an NPC or a robot? The whole thing is we need more quests. 
---
Totally in agreement, this game isn't rated for children. Not all media needs to be consumable for children and safe for them. Adults should be allowed to have some things as adult-only spaces. A lot of us play these higher rated games to play with other adults, not children. If they want a game for children to play, get them a children's game. Fallout isn't, and never has been, intended for children.  
---
Feels like some parents just let them do whatever they want and expect other people to take care of them so they don't have to. It's irresponsible to plunk them down in an environment not intended for children and expect them to be catered to and protected. 
---
Dude ditch the fusion cores..
---
The Solo Settler
---
It's not about releasing garbage. It's about implementing ideas and systems then  having the player base test these systems to find flaws.
---
And before anyone starts shouting "SO WE'RE UNPAID BETA TESTERS, THEY HAVE PEOPLE TO TEST THESE THINGS"
---
Yes you are. You chose to be. And a few hundred people are going to identify problems/exploits/bugs significantly faster than a small group of testers. 
---
Expecting BGS to have a squad of testers of decent size to test this stuff does not make fiscal sense. 
---
The Hangover
---
I would say your AP drains faster so you have to rest more, you know because cats sleep all the dam time
---
I’ve seen this recipe in Enclave bunker a number of times.
---
Like saying sorry when you accidentally throw a Grenade at somebody’s CAMP when you’re actually just trying to wave? Or shooting them when you’re working on a bad guy together because you used VATS? I’d like a way to be able to say sorry to the robots too. I accidentally shot one once when I was helping kill a bad guy, and the robot turned on me! I didn’t stand a chance! Lol
---
If you're on xbox, go to recent players, view their profile, and click join game from the xbox menu. Might work on playstation if they have a similar system.
---
Amen to that. 
---
I'm on PC and everything takes a minute to show up for me. I'll be getting killed by stuff I can't even see yet. I'll have to sit and wait for my base to load in every time. I'm on a cliff, too, so if I forget to log out in power armor I fall to my death.
---
I play at my native res which is 1600x900 and average 60-90 frames but the stuttering ruins it for some odd reason. 
---
I'm fine with kids playing the game as ling as their parents approve and know what the game contains. I however, will not alter my behavior in any way. I will kill them for their caps or junk. I will destroy their camp to incite pvp etc. I do thus to any player. I have zero discrimination. 
---
If an underage kid wandered into a bar, are the patrons expected to act differently? Or is the child out of place?
---
As someone who compulsively sticks random objects up his ass, have my upvote.
---
&gt;Complaining about getting killed in Survival is hilarious. If you don't want to die, don't be on the Survival server?
---
IMO i think you are charging too much for ionized meat. its not useful for making flux and its only good as a snack
---
Nothing is real but people would be more attached to a human with a lufe and personality as opposed to a robot that is manufactured and replicable.  
---
Is anyone going to run into a burning building to save a toaster? No.  
---
Is anyone going ro run into a burning building to save a person? Yes.  
---
At the end of the day, yes it needs more quests, but id rather be helping a 'person' than a 'robot'
---
You need therapy...
---
Thanks! I'll let him know. 
---
Pretty sure this is the Bethesda approved response.
---
Add something else to the wishlist: Ham Radios can be used to contact nearby players. Activate one, it turns on a radio station that the player can speak into to spread a message, like requesting help, letting people know you’re looking to trade, etc. 
---
I've just learned to wing it, I land about 50-66% of the shots I am when mid ranged. Long ranged I just hail mary and hope.
---
I haven’t failed any SBQ fight since the TSE change.  Did two fights yesterday and there were a dozen plus people there including level 30s just standing around.  
---
I would be happier if I could turn in like ten of them for an upgraded, legendary crate or something like that. As is though, they're not really a great end game tool but if you remember they are utterly fantastic 1-50. I think I've picked up about four total Handmades from the game world and two of them came from Aid Drops. A lot of my higher end tech came from then until I was able to craft them myself much later on. 
---
10/10 would call in again
---
Sometimes, it doesn't just work.
---
He said a CAP donation box, not a BLAST CAP donation box. 
---
Maybe you'd better lay off the stuff...
---
Three separate times in a row ?
---
Underrated comment.
---
Yeah I haven't played much recently and was wondering "what's he talking about, I thought they did work properly."
---
Its multiplicative, not additive, you don't get 115% damage protection ever, it just reduces the final amount so much that it barely goes through DR, and even after the armor there are many ways to negate damage further - serendipity, dodgy, dense mod, fireproof perk etc. 
---
There's already that as a perk, it's extremely underwhelming and it takes up two spots. 
---
We'd like to use this tonight. Can you please give us the EXACT measurement, certified by an accredited independent  quality assurance laboratory, within the next 2 hours. Thanks in advance.
---
Oh yeah stablized is great. I think explosive actually lowers accuracy in my experience between my tse gatling plasma and my suppressor one. The weakness is power armor which means no legendary perks. 
---
How about cat-like instead of cat eyes. Can see in the dark, moves silently at all time, but a -2 Endurance buff, because cats are kinda weak
---
Don't know what platform you're on but I got mine for 200 caps each 
---
Or soloing the nuke silos and having it crash right at the end 
---
The unlucky responder
---
I'm afraid to say you probs my won't get them back. I have had issues with this in the past and I was told several times that they cant restore lost items :(
---
What console are you on. I have some mutation serums if your desperate.
---
Yeah scrapping. You can always buy the plans and then craft, scrap, repeat. 
---
You're doing it very wrong if you're expecting a big baddie in the literal starting area a stone's throw from Vault 76. It was always meant for new players and they are indeed a challenge for low levels. That's why you're always getting 25 and under gear. 
---
Alright, search for ultraflex initiated
---
It's a snack that doesn't degrade.
---
Why can't you dilute super stimpaks into 2 normal stimpaks? 
---
I know, it sucks because it only works while crouching and I think it makes more sense as a mutation :o
---
Same. Enclave vendor sells them all the time.  
---
You got a link to the video? I am interested in watching it if you can find it.
---
Thats would be good for stealth builds :o
---
What family's holotapes do you follow through in Fallout 3?

---
VATS is so back-asswards in this game. Every. Single. Goddamn. Time. Me and other playerd in adventure are killing bad guys together (especially during SBQ) VATS targets every other player on the field and hardly ever the bad guys. Then in Survival I can never get VATS to work on another player even if they're in plain sight right in front of me.
---
Vampire typically works better the faster the fire or swing speed. Since it’s an incremental increase, the more hits the better. With shotguns if all the pellets don’t hit, you don’t get the small increase. 
---
Thanks for your support. I did not get any loot from the queen that time, probably because i waited to long. I was only there for ingredients for a Biv daily anyway (but it spoiled to fast so someone gave it to me, big thanks to him).
---
1, the one where you fight for the dam
---
That is exactly who is downvoting you. Nail on the head. Some people just refuse to be told they are wrong.
---
Workshops are fine as is. You can literally just leave the server until you find a free one if you don't want to fight someone, every time. The idea is that the resources are there for anyone and if you want them at the same time as someone else does, you're going to have to fight for it. They're not supposed to be endless resource fountains you don't have to work for/defend. 
---
If you want to gain mass resources, you can take over half the map and let the loot come raining in but you should not be able to monopolize it. If there was a pile of gold outside your front door, eventually someone is going to show up to claim it permanently. 
---
That's nice of you, I wanna do the same but for some reason they either ignore me or just run off (thinking ill kill them or something?) Yeah I've had some challenges bugged aswell, like the last disease one, so currently 21/22 on it :( 
---
&gt;I swear I'm losing aid items on that character as well.
---
I’m fairly certain you are mistaken. 
---
Just 3k Atoms? For people that paid the launch price, this will be a big hit in their face. Also this would screw things up, because exploits can be used and the items can be washed clean and then get sold at various places. You can't trust any trade, because it might be an illegal optained item and prices will drop.   
---
I'm not totally against f2p but Bethesda should present a way, that most people can agree on. 3k Atoms are just not worth it. One Idea for me might be different amounts of atoms, based when you bought the game, like 10k on launch, 5k when bought after 1 to 2 months and 3k when f2p becomes an offical topic. Paid players or later "premium" members should have certian advantages like more xp, more caps, more storage space and other things. Also free players should get heavily limited Atoms for free. Some Milestones are okay but not like its now. Also free accounts should be limited in trading, so if items are illegal obtained, it won't flood the market directly and having free accounts to abuse as mule also should be limited.
---
A couple days ago i made 2 large purchases of some very much needed junk and a fellow scorchbeast arrives and kills me. So i make way back to get back my much needed junk and the server crashes and leaves me with no junk and the loss of the caps i spent to get that junk, i just put the controller down and walked away.
---
Worship of Atom is already here, in your heart friendo. Embrace His glow. 
---
Well, sometimes i wish i was into PvP. Lol. But that loot isn't worth much anyway. Currently...
---
I kind of wish it was just like the fo4 system where we would set up all exchanges to complete a trade at once and the game would just take or pay the caps difference automatically 
---
The golden girls, I love it. 
---
Happened again today, but not while fast traveling, happened when respawning during a SBQ fight.
---
I try not to kill the ones who are glitched out. They're peaceful, what kind of person does it make me to waltz through Appalachia killing the only other friendlies out there for their crap?
---
And sometimes I get a couple unarmed low level scorched outside my base. They just creep around, peeking in my windows, groaning. They give an unexpectedly chilling atmosphere to my happy little inn, I love it.
---
Maybe one way to do that is to put a Bank in Whitesprings. Or make the one in morgantown actually function as a bank. Basically where you can access a pooled account for all of those characters. Deposit items on one, pick them up on another, so you can plan and customize the way you want your separate characters to work. Tie it to your Bethesda account and not your selected character.
---
You can jump up the wall and get in there. There is a you tube video. Or get marsupial mutation
---
lol you guys come up with the most random requests. 
---
I imagine the coding would be a nightmare so I wouldn't hold your breath. 
---
It’s funny - for the reason mentioned above, I initially thought it wasn’t enough. Appreciate the feedback. 
---
No, thats not the idea. The idea is that once you own it, theres no option AT ALL for you to sell or relinquish a workshop. 
---
Out of all the annoying mechanics in this game, this one drives me the most crazy. Bobbleheads and magazines were awesome in fo4. You could collect them, display them... at Starlight Drive-in I had a whole room in my camp dedicated to them. In this game, instead of displaying them, we eat them??? Who thought this was a good idea? Why fix what wasn't broken??? (As with most things wrong in this game, I blame Battle Cry.)
---
They really ought to replace it entirely with something else completely and free up the slot for something people would actually use, I agree. But considering how valuable they apparently think it is, the negative that comes along with it would probably also suck at not be worth it. 
---
At least you can rejoin a server if you were a apart of a team. Crazy story my cat laid down behind the Xbox on the power strip and hit the reset button lol. I turned everything back on and to my surprise there was a rejoin team option. Never even knew it existed. Allowed me to go back to my nuked whitesprings I spent the morning nuking. 
---
Whitespring would be a nice spot for that. Morgantown has a bank building we could be given a quest to get running, and of course Watoga has enough robotic staff and underutilized buildings that that would be another great area for that.
---
neither does dog food
---
That's both an interesting and an unfortunate weapon. On one hand, a two-shot grenade launcher weapon sounds amazing, but the breachload aspect completely hobbles the damage output. And the VATS hit chance hobbles it further because (I think) the best damage comes from the area effect, and not from direct hits in VATS.
---
This is a nice novelty, in my opinion. Does anybody have any good ideas how best to utilize this weapon? I'm sure it has value I'm not seeing.
---
For dealing with the vendors, that would be idea for sure!
---
That could be another way of going about an improved training system
---
It does for the harpoon gun, but I'm haven't tested with others
---
Marsupial and healing factor are the obvious ones. I also include scaley skin, unless you're a berserker, I guess. And talons, which is free unarmed damage, useful even if you don't play unarmed. Especially if you don't use unarmed.
---
This is how I feel do I have no clue what it's worth
---
Not sure TBH lol. I'll remember that for the next time it happens, thanks!
---
You think the rngessus would be kind enough to give me the heavy metal torso?
---
I'm a pa user so I dont need it anymore, but I have a friend who can barely survive outside of the vault.
---
I personally think that this feature is something we need more than repair kits. You can increase the durability of your weapons/armor via perks in-game but there is not a quick way to change your perk load outs. If only Bethesda would listen to us.
---
You have to pony up some caps just to attack the person, regardless of if you even gain control of it. They're not going to be adding in ways for caps to change hands outside of an interaction that was already meant to take caps out of economy. 
---
Relinquishing is as easy as logging out to the main menu or simply not putting up a fight. You're asking them to rewrite code for a mechanic that you can already do without it. I'm all for suggestions but ground them in something that makes sense for Bethesda to spend time/money on. 
---
I have a kid. He's 9. He's not allowed to play Fallout, but I DO let him get on to help me mule items. He thinks it's fun. That's the extent of his interaction with the game. He can go play Fortnite on Playground if he wants to actually play something.
---
"Underwater Breathing Bobblehead"
---
I just want to rock flip flops or slippery while in a bathrobe, tee shirt, shorts and shades. Is that so much to ask?
---
Trading, ya mook. Ya trade for your equipment. You have missed very fundamental features of this game. You don't know what you're doing and you refuse to learn the game. 
---
1st of all I didnt downvote you stop being child about it. 2nd I wasnt saying repair kits are goodninwas making a point about the way people are handling the situation. 
---
You look real mature right now my guy.
---
Can we get the same ping system used in apex legends with an emote/ voice ?
---
Been to the emergency roon yet?
---
We also need a Goodbye emote. :(
---
This has happened to me twice after a server disconnection. I've had to exit out the game completely for the bug to be resolved.
---
They're all synths anyway.
---
i am one of the suckers that bought the game at full price when it came out, because i am a huge fan. played all the fallouts to death. but with 76, i just see a failure. call me entitled, but i am not happy with the small little tidbits of "improvements" that do very little to alleviate the tediousness of the game. i am being punished for playing the game. energy weapons are terrible even after updates (i waited forever for plasma weapons to be fixed.... is it too much to ask for an entire weapon class to work at launch?) armor and weapons lose durability so quickly that you have to specifically farm to maintain gear, especially automatic guns (durability loss per bullet what kinda game design is that?) repairing arms, armor, crops, turrets. and dont even think about using ultracite ammo, because if your guns already need thousands of ammo to take down the queen, how are you going to get all the flux needed to make so much ammo? it's just painful to think that we are being punished so hard for using better gear, which is kinda the point of the game, and then we have to farm so hard to upkeep them.
---
and then i see free games like warframe pushing out massive gameplay changes and huge content packs, and then i see fallout76 and without even reading patch notes, i know that energy weapons still can't compete with ballistics even though their ammo is heavier and more expensive, and it just makes me sad to see that they added a few new emotes and cosmetics in the store and pretty much nothing else of what i found enjoyable in fo4.
---
i wish they'd remove durability altogether honestly.
---
i am honestly happy that you still find pleasure in this game though. but i come back every patch and am continuously disappointed in how meager they change things.
---
Our faction " The Remnant" treats each other as equals, everyone can have their say, there's no tax, we help each other out with missions and equipment whenever we can.

Here's a link

---
We are ps4 only 
---
That's not right dude. If it is then sight your official source. Its not 15% × 15% over and over as that would actually reduce the affect.
---
 There are several reasons why I can't log off a server, and besides, this change would be so minimal that it would take probably a matter of a few hours to make, and it's such a good quality of life change 
---
Precisely, but it also makes you vulnerable to stealth attacks(in survival), meaning you have to be good at stealth as opposed to just getting a buff
---
Lol let’s not overthink this thing buddy
---
Yeah.. hopefully, you know, fix the game. 
---
I'm still going to play it, I love fallout, but sometimes bug and glitches make me sad.
---
They down voted you because it is the truth. The PvP in this game is more unbalanced than in Dark Souls. They should just make PvP remove all weapon and armor legendary effects. Having something like 3* legendaries with an insane RNG impact PvP is ludicrous. Overall, the structure of fallout and its mechanics was never meant for PvP, and will never work. They should have just made this game a CoOp RPG and be done with it. Half these people stacking gear and perks to kill people without it would not last in COD, Halo, or Battle Royales where the playing ground is constantly even. Your post shines light on the fact that they need to exploit broken PvP/legendary mechanics in order to be good at a game, and so they down voted you.
---
I like to think we bonk there head but it breaks, we throw it away and it didn’t happen. 
---
Yea those were solid value in FO4 as well I think (assuming your FO3 wasn't a typo?)
---
Though, I think the main money maker (at low levels) in the prior games that caught all of us by surprise... was the Prewar Money now having **zero** vendor value. :(
---
I mean sure... you can still make money off it if you collect it, scrap it into Cloth, and *then* convert it into Bulk Cloth... but holy time-consuming-endeavor, Batman!
---
Oh, so unless the change is made on exactly the same day, it's completely impossible for the change to be a deliberate way to increase revenue?
---
\*Sigh\*
---
Another one of... "those"
---
IT IS: \*Technial Data\*
---
FTFY, how many times are we gonna go over this!?
---
Did this never come to fruition? As of now, the interactive map only has five plan locations listed.
---
Some do. About my third week in, my team was trying to kill a glowing deathclaw at Whitesprings, and we had to chase him all over the place. I don't think we ever actually caught him!
---
I can get behind this. One of my favorite HGTV shows is Barnwood Builders and love the log cabin look.
---
I just use the hello one
---
It’s probably why we have different views because I’m new, been in a month now. I’m not saying it’s a great game either, your right about everything you said. Thankfully the bugs are pretty low now, and I haven’t got to the end yet and are now where near using ultracite yet. I just see that I’ve had money’s worth, probably 70 hours now for 10 quid!
---
I did mean 3 but I carried the practice with me to 4.
---
And yeah prewar money being essentially worthless destroyed all my money making business from previous games.
---
Hell I was so used to it being valuable that I was trying to sell it at launch and thought I was encountering a glitch 
---
Little did I know....
---
I guess you have to regularly be at your base. My base always loads within a few seconds of fast traveling there. 
---
Also if manage to get the civil war hat plan I hear it sells for crazy caps and only costs 1 cloth to make.
---
I'm talking about when the game just booted and you spawn in the world for the first time since the game has launched on your system
---
Just a reminder that server hopping unclaims a workshop
---
Just remember you absolutely have to wear raider armor or else you're just a griefer not a raider. /s
---
We also need to be able to view who you killed last and who was the last one that killed you. 
---
I’m down to kill the SBQ, too.
---
Got keycards, if it helps.
---
Are you saying that if all of my pellets don’t hit, then it doesn’t heal at all?
---
I still load the entire base after about 10 seconds, but it is server side so network speed will have the largest effect on this. 
---
They go in the ass
---
Make sure to get them bloody mess. Gotta have the geniune fallout experience 
---
True, but there are several other reasons why I wouldn't want to server hop, and what happened to fallout being about multiple choices to solve a problem? It wouldn't hurt anything, and the normal PvP system would still exist if the owner declined the offer or didn't respond at all to it. 
---
Yeah but that's what I'm talking about. Thise 10 seconds of your base not being there
---
GAMMA GUN, boys, GAMMA GUN! There's only so much radiation an Ass'n/Sent player can mitigate since those Damade Reduction affects don't change radiation damage. A radium rifle for back-up with VATS crits and pumpkin grenades wouldn't hurt either.
---
Ill join in if you drop one. My server has too many lowbies for me to.
---
Huh. I was wondering why I've been dying more often. But yeah, it takes more strategy. I spawned into Uranium Fever (before the event had begun) and I got killed by a spawn camper. I spawned at the event again and ran toward the train station. The same guy chased me. I hot a crit hit with my mutant's explosive dragon but it didn't kill him, he just kept coming. So I continued to run away but hid in a bush (chameleon armor), waited for him to pass, and nailed him with my bloodied meat hook and took him out.
---
Last one's in. Shout out forthcoming.
---
There are better legendaries out there. Better ways of finding them. Let go of The Whitespring. 
---
I make people explode into blood sausage. 18 seems fine to me. 
---
You want to have rampant cheating and abusive players?  Yeah sure make it free.  
---
I might have some if your willing 2 wait a few hrs
---
Amen! At least access pip boy or go 3rd person. 
---
More weather I general would make the atmosphere feel more turbulent and not so damn placid.
---
I recently restarted. Your carry weight is still pretty low but the storage limit on stashboxes is up to 800. I think they also adjusted the weight on a few items so it’s not as much of a hassle.
---
I’d love to be able to plant the crops I need for brewing
---
That makes perfect sense. Well at least it was upvoted a few times before it went negative.
---
You cannot ever make a quiz without that question being there :p
---
So what is the price of each individualize item then? Does there exist there a definitive value set for the community  to fallow that is not based on build or personal opinion?
---
Cool, I'm pretty much free all day
---
I kind of headcannoned them as being like pez dispensers, in that there's candy inside of them that you eat.  But there's way more hilarious answers here so let's go with those.
---
&gt;I’d love to be able to plant the crops I need for brewing
---
I agree with you 
---
Events and workshops. I keep having to dump stims and super stims and radaway at the overseers camp or train stations or giving them away to people to keep my inventory at reasonable levels. I literally never have to make them.
---
As far as I know, they will implement a new legendary system for players who are 50 lvl and beyond as a part of one of the upcoming DLCs.
---
Healing salves
---
Video game prices have not changed much in over 20 years though while everything else has inflated. Players don't seem to want to pay any more, while they already get many hours of entertainment for a very small amount of money.
---
I don’t care either way.  I have gotten my money’s worth.   I am more concerned about them keeping the game running for years.   
---
1. No idea.
---
2. No, yes.
---
3. Yes.
---
NOT THE DUCKS
---
Maybe I need to change my outfit, looking combat ready all the time isnt maybe the best when approaching people, but yeah I'm gonna wait til the raids gets released then I'm hopefully pulled into it again. I wanna love the game but there's so many issues that needs to be resolved.
---
You sure you’re playing the right game?
---
Totally agree with you, I launched my first ever nuke on site prime and before I got there, like 2 meters away from the location... my game crashes ! 
---
I also had a problem where I read the poster and the quest wouldn't activate. I exited the game and restarted the next day, same problem. Anybody have a solution?
---
Yeah, their support is the worst I've ever seen. 
---
Define raider?
---
May this be usefull?

You could sell the workshop as it stands by coming to some arrangement and agreeing to leave the build zone so they can contest it. I get that some people aren't interested in PvP, but there are work arounds currently (such as just server hopping to relinquish control). Most times people want a workshop they'll just server hop until they find one where it isn't claimed, so I buying them will be underutilized. Further, when most people contest your workshop they just want to kill you. They don't care about the resources. The multiple choices are already there. Lastly, in the event that you're killed for your workshop, death is very, very inconsequential in adventure mode. If you die, you just respawn somewhere else and that's the end of your confrontation. 
---
You're asking for less PvP confrontation when claiming a workshop pretty directly warns that it could potentially pull you into PvP. If you don't want the risk, then don't claim them.
---
Cool idea!
---
Hey dude, right there with you. I'm looking to casually rp as essentially a firebreather/freestater/responder esc faction
---
As of now I try and pick up bystanders with "quests" that involve rebuilding workshops and getting powerplants up in running to help make free and open resource areas for all wastlanders.

This- first time I was in there (with out the quest marker) my buddy was fiddling with the terminal unsuccessfully I was running in little circles playing hardcore parkour- and was somehow on the other side of the locked fence looking at him as he finally came through the door 
---
There's a plan spawn at Grafton Steel -- northwest corner, standalone building where the armor workbench is, it's in one of the open lockers. Not much else around there, but worth mentioning; I've received a couple good armor plans from that one. 
---
Spread the word wanderer

How many kids do you have? Is it enough to tell other people how to parent theres?

No. You have some big ideas and want to force them on others.

And where is there a law that says  children can't play mature games? Like anywhere?

I’ll find a good rom than drop . I’ll drop my GT when I find one and we’ll take her down

Did you guys start it yet?

Everything's a dildo if you're brave enough
---
Nothing to do with one shot or letting their health regen. I tested this extensively. 
---
We are in Bravo, just starting the process. 
---
That’s right, we should call the internet police on them 
---
How is that fair though? A low level player who want resources is obviously never going to be able to protect themselves from a level 200. And no, it's not fair to avoid PvP because many a times have I been in my workshop and without warning, I get one shotted from behind, without no notification of intrusion. I don't want to deal with that. Side note, it's not as simple as it sounds. Junk collection is a big deal, especially later on for maintenance on gear which you'll use more often. So dying still has a significant impact
---
Deezers lemonade from fo4

They did. You missed it.

I agree. That's not okay, as long as whatever fix can't be exploited somehow for infinite buffs.
---
That's boss of you, thank you so much for the offer!  I managed to get most of them, I just felt bad because my buddy put in alot of effort getting them for me.  People like you are what make the reddit community such an amazing one, thank you again!

I've noticed that I'll go from 60 FPS to 1 FPS and then crash. For no reason.

I get in on this, too?

I finally get the nerve up to try to launch my first nuke and when I get to the nuke zone, game crashes. I run solo. Very disappoint.
---
I've found it hit or miss, this time definitely missed!
---
I would love to get more building sets and this one would be perfect!
---
Once you've got all the camp plans you want, plans for armor and weapons you want. You can't really use them for much.

I'm on ps4, will be on here soon

Luck setting has absolutely zero effect on drops. It only affects the condition of the loot so who cares, head to the benches with artisan perk you’re all set.

Play the game before you say it's been improved.

So what does the idea solution look like in your eyes?

I gotta have workshops cause I sell lead and I need acid to break down my lead ore. But yeah it’s a bitch when this happens. Pisses me right off.

How is this a market place if there is no defined value for any of the items made available for sale?

There are a thousand parents right now starving or beating their children. Stop assuming everyone is a good parent because they managed to have sex.

In relation to building and modding energy weapons you will often need the 'Science' perk along with 'Science Expert' and 'Science Master'.

 The ones where my CAMP budget was f-ed up I was told to check my firewall. Then asked if my computer met minimum requirements. I've got over 500 hours in game, and my CAMP budget is fucked because my deathclaw kept dying and resurrecting and every time it'd add 10% to my budget, and they're asking about my firewall and PC specs? Gimme a break. 
---
Maybe. I'm wearing a brotherhood science scribe outfit and medical goggles. I was gonna do that before I joined a different discord. Which in turn gives me daily missions to do to keep me busy. 
---
You're warned that claiming a workshop can pull you into PvP and you have to agree to it before you claim it. You agreed to it, so that's fair. If you don't want to lose your junk on death, you store it. I have a level 320, so I understand how important junk is and how easy it is to safeguard yourself from PvP and losing it.

None of them render the world the way Fallout does. They are very limited in draw distance. 
---
I suggested this a month or two ago. 
---
I called it Decks. Ties in with perk cards
---
You get 3 decks per character. One and level 1-2. One at level 30 and one more at level 50. 
---
Each deck can be named and contain any perks unlocked and maintain their positions. Decks can’t be identical. 
---
This way you can have one combat, one crafting and one utility deck for each of the main needs in game. 
---
&gt;they bitched when the bag they bought was the wrong material
---
I feel like that is a perfectly reasonable thing to complain about. If a product is promoted as X material, you buy it at the asked price and instead get product of a much cheaper and lower quality material, I think people can be upset about that.
---
Wow, yeah, yours was more miss than hit!
---
Sadly, up until this post I really hadn't put all that much thought into where I find certain things such as this, taking their eventual turning-up in a container for granted...
---
That said...  
---
I can't say \*definitively\* that I've looted any Technical Data out of Tall or Short \*square\* filing cabinets; however, if I had to take a lie detector test, I'd state that I have at some point and be completely confident I wasn't lying.  
---
Though I asked my friend who has a solid memory and she stated that she recalls with 100% certainty having found Technical Data in at least *one*. As she recalls the thought of "it's about time I find this in a filing cabinet!"
---
I concur on also having found them in the round filing cabinets *(blue and orange, tall and short),* such as in the Charleston Harold, where I've came out of there with at *least* 2 in the past. 
---
As well as the desks in the Bunker, which... until you called them Wood, I thought they were metal; alas, after you said that I do indeed remember them being wood. I mention this due to the relevance of me bothering to count and list the Desks in my Harper's Ferry report, because I checked them due to thinking they **were** the same kind as in the Bunker :\\ So now I have to call into question whether or not the gray metal office-desks (which match the square filing cabinets) are even a location they ever turn up in...
---
BUT, I have a location or two that I can check which I think has as good of chance as any to have one turn up in that style metal desk, so I will go take a look-see and find out...  
---
*Up-up and away!!!* ^(\*vanishes\*)
---
Who said they were? That's not even close to the same thing and you know it. 
---
Thank you for your helpful reply!
---
Ya, I didnt mean for this to turn into a fight, I just thought that it's weird to talk about a game you've never played. The game has improved quite a bit, but there is still plenty of issues with the game that hold it back.

I sold a level 50 bloodied gatling to a vendor bot by accident yesterday. Left the server then realized the horrible mistake. 
---
Hey I found that cave a while back, cool place to set up in.
---
It’s not useless because “just manually use one” requires an animation and you can’t do it if you’ve been staggered. The perk just uses it and doesn’t have the stim animation. 
---
&gt;t of them I wouldn't sell over 300 caps. Look the Assassin Flamer, first effect gives you what, 10-20% dmg to Players, It alone gets beaten by TS or E
---
It's unfair to compare this weapon or any other in the game to anything with one of those highly sought after effects. You're values are based solely off of your personal opinion  of what the item itself is worth meaning the legitimate value of my items is brought into question if you can just sate the amount of which you'd like to  sell it for I can  what's stopping me from simply pricing my items at what ever ludicrous value in which that I see fit? I hardly think this is the best way to sell my items with me being able to sell my items for real money at this site here.
---
  [https://www.u4gm.com/fallout-76-items](https://www.u4gm.com/fallout-76-items)  Of course the trustworthiness of this site is brought into question as I have not heard anything about it fallout 76 is already pay to win so what's stopping me from selling my items there aside from the chance of me getting scammed? 
---
Dog Food gives 10% food at base. 30% if you take the time to swap a perk card. Ionized meat gives 20% food base, double with carnivore. Both weigh the same.  I'd say there are many clear benefits to carrying meat over dog food that justifies a higher price.

You're assuming the person has no children, and if they do they still shouldn't be allowed to teach others on proper parenting. People learn from other people. You assume everyone knows whats best for their children by themselves and should never be governed by the million other people around them. However, there are known incest pedophiles, children beater/killer, generally terribly bad parents out there. But yea who has a right to teach them how to raise a child.
---
Do you get it?
---
iihatefaces
---
&gt; They get the same amount of caps and aid drops  
---
Has this been changed from adventure where the Caps dropped are tied to the player level, because in adventure if im level 150 and I get killed by a level 20, I lose 150 caps, if I kill them, they lose 20 caps
---
I came up with the idea awhile ago aswell. I didnt think to much about it tho, but that would work verywell. Why cant bethesda give us something useful like that?
---
Weird, I’m just clinking the share button on the imgur app, and it copies the link, I’m just pasting it onto Reddit 
---
I accidentally stumble upon him aswell, instantly bought all the recipes 😂😂
---
Actually, I never assumed how many children anybody has (though I'm now assuming that you have none- prove me wrong)  
---
People do learn from other people. Yet another hollow argument. 
---
No, you do not have the right ever to tell a parent what is best for their own child. We arn't talking about molestation. That's straw man shit at best. 
---
The only problem with a radio host is that they usually talk about you, the single character or events you might come across later in your journey. If we did have a radio host in FO76, what would they talk about? Everyone isn't all on the same quest and the radios are all connected to time so you can all be listening to the same song at the same time. If we did have a radio host though, they could talk about big events going on at that time like scorched earth, hoard events or if a nuke is falling and where it is going to land.
---
This is just what I think
---
Dont log into train stations, watch the top 3 dont be one of them or by them. If you want to grind a toon in survival dont spend points on luxury or pve perks only pvp perks. I just went from lvl 21 to lvl 45 in survival semi fast, I also won 3/4 of the pvp exchanges I got into 1/1. I have done a lot of pvp on my main though. My point is considering my gear is crap on my low lvl except for a decent weapon I do way better in pvp than I probably should. A high lvl weapon does less dmg to low players, it's been ingame from the start and been tested. If your having trouble in pvp as a lower lvl its probably your build, points extreamly important at low lvl pvp.

Yeah, Idk. I started playing Fallout 3 when I was in 5th grade. So I mean, I could handle it. I think some kids are able to handle M-rated games. It really depends on the child. I turned out fine. Some kids are able to differentiate from reality and fiction. I was one of those kids. It should be a parental choice. My father bought me fallout 3 because he knew I could handle an M-rated game. But some kids can’t. It should be up to the parent’s discretion, imo.

I'd love to be a farmer so I'm on board with more crops

Yea, we all cried a little inside about that :(
---
And indeed, being able to craft some clothing is a good money maker. I don't know if the Civil War Museum *(due-west of Palace of the Winding Path)* is a stop worth making due to the limited number of clothing items that *do* spawn there, but I suppose it's worth mentioning at least.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the only way to obtain the plans for crafting those civil war clothing items is by doing the related events, yes?
---
Make sure your resolution is set to 1080p and full screen. The game by default is in windowed which causes massive lag and it doesn't do well at higher resolutions either.
---
Join on me . Two people at Charlie now

And some parents realize their kid is able to handle M-rated themes. It depends on the kid and the parent’s discretion.

Despite all of that, what would be the harm in having this new system?

same even tho my camp reached budget..and I'm to stubborn to leave my current area in the savage divide
---
You can get the plans from random spawn locations.
---
There is one just up the road from the overseers camp most people use.
---
You just run up to find a civil war reenactors body and they have a chance of having the plans.
---
Give me the naughty nightwear!
---
Haha I recently moved to a little waterfall/tree area that I'm really trying to make extravagant
---
What does that mean
---
Their  dropping on SBQ and already in the process join up ! 👍
---
What about durability? Does it make them last longer before they need to be repaired?
---
There’s a lil cave on the road above harpers I’ve seen some dope bases in that one
---
Here's is a youtube video someone made showing a few random spawn locations
---
https://youtu.be/YRP02uM6hIc
---
Important to not that if the re-enacter  doesn't spawn in the location **dont** loot what is there and just leave world and join a new one(server hop) more or less until you get the one you want.
---
Oh and pray to RNGesus that he smile on you.
---
I found the civil war dress and shirt plan but no hat plan after close to 200 quantum leaps(my pet name for server hoping)
---
Ooooooooooooo!!!!!!! I'm excited for new content!
---
Nah just here and there! Always a discount on something tho :)
---
Nobody liked Carrington either. 
---
And you can get a recipe for Red Ant Beer from Biv, which gives 50lbs
---
I've seen people theorizing about what possible future content the door could be used for, but this is the first time I've heard of someone glitching to see behind it and discovering something.
---
Do you have any screenshots?
---
I have the issue in power armor where I will switch to a shotgun and it won't let me? It says I can't in PA. I have to open the pip boy and select it to switch. It's a pain when fighting the SBQ. It sometimes works though 🙄 it's all good I'm use to it.
---
Another issue is my Vats doesn't work until I'm right up on the enemy, this is only in PA. Another bug I'm used too.. 😊
---
He's trying to say that he should keep both affects when logging not just the bad one.
---
Typically there's a free item coinciding with each update.
---
Will try.  Ty
---
Do you know if being on a widescreen screw with the game as well?
---
Maybe it’s not on the agenda. But upvoting should get attention to someone. It’s a good idea and should be made known. 
---
There's a pretty well-missed cave near vault 76 that sometimes has a dart board above a small top hole entrance that leads into, that I've seen one or two 'survivalist' bases in.
---
Some people are crazy good with that building stuff.
---
I agree. 
---
We're a buncha nobodys lol. No one wants our ideas they just want repair kits from the atom shop.
---
It's really fun when you find out a super mutant was shooting you with a semiautomatic... super sledge?
---
I don't have any off the doors because it happened quick,I will try to see if I can glitch again to take  picture but im 100% sure there is vault door.
---
They have several vaults. They planned to open some so you could start a character at a different vault. Dunno if thats still a thing but I do know they are making Vault 94 a high level raid. 
---
There’s another one on the same road in the mire. It’s by a power pylon and it has an underground home already built in it that you can put you base in.. there’s a lot of buildings you can claim as a base you just gotta figure out base glitches to be able to build some glorious ones in em 
---
You gotta put them waaaaay up inside your butthole, Morty!
---
Joining. 
---
I use a wide variety of weapons and gunsmith seems to increase anything that isn’t melee/unarmed, expect pipe rifles. It definitely effects explosives like the missile launcher. 
---
That’s why you don’t give up/in keep showing that you know what your talking about. 
---
Made a low level alt, stopped leveling at 60, went hunting high levels in survival, 25k caps in 4 days. :D
---
You kinda quirky doe :-)
---
Also been thinking this the last few days with the constant switching out I now have to do lol
---
Very true I just set up on a little truck and shack just outside of camp venture and just trying to get the base to work with that was a nightmare.
---
I can't imagine the issues with building in a cave.
---
I guess I'll give that a go next
---
Got app. 25 of them and rising.. I think sending signal from one of that towers and search the box for 25 mins and loot a hunting rifle is some sort of stupidity... 
---
Combat rifle for me. Good at all ranges. Can lay down 5-10 shots for each single shot from a hunting rifle. Hardened and silenced. Instigating if you can find it. Paired with mister sandman perk will clear a mob of anything in seconds.
---
Finally someone who understands
---
My current base is below white springs on the snake icon on that building. I have an entire home made in that building. Trying to align floating walls without foundations on that home was a pain in the ass 
---
Quite annoying. Luckily there is a mod for this on PC at least. 
---
They’ll be in the atom shop in a few days. Just wait till then to see what the details are. 
---
Pretty much TSE Handmades for days.
---
If you’re looking for someone just to anchor you to a world and share perk cards of varying usefulness, I’m your guy.    You’ll likely get gifted multiple workshops as I bounce between alts.
---
I am likely a horrible person to group with on a roam around basis.  I often think “I’ll do this today” and 3 hours later have still not completed it. 
---
Msg me if you want to be friends with someone that is likely a horrible person to group with!  I’m also a horrible self promoter!
---
You asked him how many he had, as if he has no experience. Fucking shit too many people can't think beyond one moment at a time. Use the neurons!!! pathetic.
---
I'm not sure what you are trying to point out. Dying in survival is literally not the problem. Why i said please read. Lets try this again...
---
When you enter a event you cannot hurt other players until the moment it ends. Most events end with the death of a legendary. SBQ ends the very second she dies (or at the timer end when you fail). The second she dies the 13 people around you who you were just fighting with and were invincible to player damage immediately become hostile and can kill you for caps and guard the SBQ corpse to keep you from your loot and FARM THE PLAYER TRYING TO GET THEIR REWARD FOR CAPS UNTIL IT DESPAWNS.  
---
The killing and dog eat nature of survival is great. I have no problem with it, I've made 3k caps doing so.
---
The problem is it is clearly an easily abusive situation and people who fought with you, spending thousands of rounds and resources now get nothing for helping you and lose 100s to 1000s of caps trying to get their reward.
---
Do you understand?

On way

tried this, scrapped foundation, walls and ceiling, still there.
---
Rip, once again PC wins.
---
That’s it, I’m doing every messenger event I see. I love crafting armor. 
---
1) 200 caps
---
2) 300 caps
---
3) 100 caps
---
4) 200 caps
---
5) 0 caps, I would thrown that out right away
---
6) 100 caps
---
7) 300 caps
---
8) 200 caps
---
9) 100 caps
---
it just vanished when i logged out and back in a day later
---
That scales with the players doing the quest too would be nice
---
lol I like ur style..I as well would make a horrible campaign..I try not to set courses for my sessions..I just roam and let the fall out gods take me where they may..add me iihatefaces 
---
Their the descendants of the sloths that broke out the garrahan estates. 
---
Pc -&gt; mod
---
Ah I haven’t checked that place out yet
---
Oh I can imagine I used to have my place built *right* in front of that little concession stand. Till the game ate it for no reason.
---
(Chameleon) 1. I'll be on around 7p.m. EST. Forgot today was Sunday family business.
---
You still got him?
---
Nobody speaks unless they’ve already teamed up. There a huge need for expanded emotes. 
---
I think your just in denical.
---
It’s pretty cool. Really good view 
---
Whether your at your camp or out adventuring, we need loadouts.... switching 10cards around every 2 mins sucks. 
---
Hm, might have to remove the door mesh so I can walk in and see.
---
Iirc there is an estate near the excavator armor mine place that talks about it. Either the guy made them, like the deathclaws were made or he studied them or something.
---
Ah I was just kidding around man but thanks!!
---
I’ve seen them maybe 25% of the time when fighting SBQ
---
My house version 1.0 starts about a minute in...dont know why I I'm closer the bear killing footage
---
https://youtu.be/OiWt0EZDvyk
---
Yes. Very yes. 
---
I did my first a couple of weeks ago, I know that feeling you've got right now, it's still fresh for me .
---
CONGRATULATIONS!!
---
I've been looking for a good waterfall to place my camp by..like an unnecessarily big waterfall something a house should not be by!
---
I'd read somewhere that they were considering opening the vauktd and putting human NPC's in thr game and claim they came ouy of the newly opened vaults. I don't remember where I read this, so it's probably just a fan theory, but that'd be awesome.
---
Hahaha what's your gamertag? I'm on now so you could check out my spot
---
My issue is sometimes forgetting to take then back off haha. Ill switch class freak for super duper then forget to put class freak back on lmao
---
i like the idea of repair kits, on the service they seem like a generally useful little product but outside of blatant greed, there is Zero reason for Bethesda to take the Fallout Fan base for granted and monetize these things, they have always had "we can shit on consumers and still make money while doing it" but this is ridiculous.
---
For me the most insulting part of this is bethesda stating "We read tons of feedback and suggestions from the Fallout 76 community, and Repair Kits were a popular request that we wanted to get into players’ hands" was this game so underdeveloped purely so they could us basic game features under the guise of servicing the fans?
---
How would they implement that? Not gonna happen. 
---
Technically yes but I never bother since maxed out gunsmith takes up 5 points and that's a lot of points to take up for a perk that's best for crafting and modding not fighting and shooting. Instead I use weapon artisan (which works on every weapon in the game) to repair my stuff to 200% and then I don't really have to worry about weapon repairs maybe every other day or so.
---
That being said gatling energy weapons after the last few patches do last a lot longer than they used to but are still not imho a very effective weapon compared to their ballistic cousins.
---
My girlfriend and I bought atomic points for cosmetics yesterday... I suggest you all do too.
---
Hmmm i just left him. I can go see if hes still down there
---
It's only happened once for me with a deathclaw, but it was so unusual that it's one of those things that ends up being memorable because of it 
---
Thank you :). It was hectic. The hardest part was navigating the silo and the "ok wtf the I do now" parts haha. Grats to you for a couple of weeks ago :)
---
It’s not cost free. It sucks time from other things that need more focus. There’s still plenty of bugs to fix
---
Magazines are also a question. I can only think of one way I've read a magazine and was unable to read it again.
---
I know a lot of people are very pro class freak, but if you are carefully choosing mutations and not going all in and getting them all, then most of the negatives for your melee build don’t impact you all that much, and you can get 3 free points.  
---
I have multiple specs I flip between on my melee, but as a 2her soldier most things I’ve noticed don’t live long enough to bother with defensive perks.  I do have them in prep for multiplayer content, for instance I swap out suppressor and tenderizer situationally.  
---
At this rate bag packs will probably be Atom shop items.
---
iihatefaces..I should be on a lil later!
---
It's a post apocalyptic wasteland. Everything should be possible to sell.
---
Thats good
---
Cool! I'll send you a friend request
---
Didn't get a crash at the SBQ today, got a respawn, but the screen was black. HUD was there, but screen black. No audio, no view of the playing field. Was still taking damage. Have had this happen when day traveling, but never during a respawn. Jumped for 15 minutes hoping I might get out back on the same server and get one shot in since I'd already went through a thousand bullets trying to take her down. By the time I got there it was done. Learned my lesson, always friend one person before the battle behind.
---
Any word on this?
---
dope!
---
I'm sorry. Xbox One
---
Thats cool I will have to check it out
---
All the time lol! "WHY THE FUCK AM I OVERWIEGHT!?"
---
Yes i do, you're my last hold.
---
Gt: RocheClip81 
---
I can see maybe skins lol. Don’t expect for them to only be AS items. They’d come out as P2W for sure that way. 
---
I haven't had any issue
---
I've been wondering, if when I see a scorched with an axe do all other players also see it with an axe or does it randomly load a melee weapon locally.
---
If I'm respawing into WS I have PA on and ready for the Nuke meaning I have the aid and perks set. Ready to go every time I go there. The one time I died there spawning into a nuke zone without PA taught me quick.
---
Id like to have a heads up for servers with nukes on them or players in silos about to spawn a queen 😎👍
---
&gt; so you could start a character at a different vault
---
Because it's wrong info.
---
Haha I really hope they add presets. 
---
That Garrahan kid had a weird thing for sloths.
---
They heard ‘’Country roaaads... take mee home’’
---
And then they came.
---
Same with Fog Crawlers.
---
About 40 seconds I think and 2-3 missiles I believe 
---
I like one rank of concentrated fire in PER and one rank of gun-fu in ACT to auto-aim mobs in VATS
---
Ha!
---
Also check if your game is running on your graphics card and not your integrated graphics.
---
😳
---
Source for either wrong or right?
---
I assume you won't be able to sprint with it on. That makes the most sense to me, anyway. And I know that doesn't sound like much, but it'd actually affect a few perks that I'm sure get steady use by plenty of players. 
---
My guess is someone doesnt like the word raid. I'd imagine it to be a dungeon but when you say raid I guess most people would associate it with WoW or destiny. Still no reason it should've been downvoted if it is the case
---
You know that makes a lot of sense
---
&gt; They’d come out as P2W for sure that way
---
How is that news at this point?
---
Thanks Formula, updated accordingly. I'll keep updating as I get more data from you kind people. 
---
You crinkle the juice inside the bobbleheads.
---
The numerous ITV blog s where they said the Vaults will be raid dungeons.
---
I mean that song pretty much made me realize its in Fo76 West Virginia I belong.
---
Oh ok my bad. Guess the guy was pulling my leg. Maybe it was to cover up the high level raid bit. But i did say I dont know if thats still a thing haha. Better then the unexplained downvote though, so thanks I guess. 
---
It is an awesome feeling. But you really should try to befriend at least one or two other players that are on when you are. It's got some very satisfying results.Sharing knowledge is the number one thing I'm grateful for when I team up.
---
I love Sanjay. He's so jaunty and just wants to use his engineering skills to make you stew.
---
THIS!!!
---
Maybe different versions with different carry capacities. Each version may have increased negative effects with increase in capacity.
---
what and reward beth for threatening to break thier promise? It's thier own fault pushing the game out before it was ready, and why no one wants to buy thier cosmetics as a result. They have no right to try to be profitable until that travesty is a distant memory, and every fuckup like this just refreshes these old wounds.
---
What are you remnants of? I was part of a gang called The Wetlungs who were taxless and stuff but I left after they started using artillery outposts to attack others camps. I had a group of beta players called the Bohemians that were all about stories, questing, and helping new players but we fell apart when the level 300 24/7 grinders started greifing us. I've been around a long time (first beta) but a break caused by that means I'm only level 58 now.
---
On that little shelf by the armor workbench?
---
Yea I’ve been tweaking on mine. I don’t run all the mutations, I don’t know if they showed on my list I posted. I run  the adrenal, speed demon, twisted muscles, marsupial, scaly skin,and healing factor. 
---
This has been a problem since day 1. Really, this is the worst problem. Server stability will never be 100% -- please implement.
---
Happened to me twice in a row.  Solo all the way to last room, and disconnect.  Made it all the way to the launch commanders for the second time, disconnect.  That was for my first ever launch.  I didnt try again for 2 months I was so pissed.  So many resources and ammo used to do that alone, not to mention the few hours lost.  Was ready to snap my disk...
---
There was no Mothman mask. Do you mean the Owl Mask?
---
Elsewhere in this thread it mentions that one of the paint numbers is missing, I have to be honest, I've got the plans, which are named and not numbered,  but I have not used them yet.
---
I don't tell parents how to parent their kids. 
---
I parent mine. You parent yours.
---
That doesn't however mean most people aren't shit parents. Which they are. Unengaged, selfish, lazy fucks.
---
You would get the standard mods almost any rifle in game for lever action except for the prime reciever just by scrapping.
---
Same for marine though they are harder to come by and some you need to find the plans to learn.
---
I dont know how many marine torsos I scrapped but I've been scraping them since lvl 100 and I'm just starting to get the buttressed mod for some of the pieces.
---
It takes time but it is annoying how long it took to finally get the buttressed mod for my marine set 100 levels later
---
I think they’re trying to skirt the line between what is obvious and what players might have to think about first. Some people don’t think repair kits are P2W while others do
---
I think the only thing pushed back was the vending machines. Could be wrong.
---
Was the junk decorating supposed to be in this patch? That would make the pushback of vending less painful 
---
Following for more info as well
---
You can add me, I’m BonerDude12
---
that’s it
---
Yes please..
---
Have you stopped defending this game finally? 
---
Along with the game resolution, check your internet speed.  I've noticed my ISP running a little slow these last two weeks and it has affected the game similar to what you described. I know it's not the game because while I play FO76 on Xbox, I've noticed some lag on my PC when I'm trying to do homework (teleconference).
---
Ik its autocorrect 
---
I'm "sleepy4792" Xbox One. Look me up if you see me on. Level 89.
---
The closest thing to this right now is grouping up with someone and hoping that at least one of your group mates doesn't disconnect with you. You have the option to join your group back when you go back to the main menu.
---
I'm trying. I'm a bit unsociable irl and online. But I am trying haha. I do give out purified water to any low levels that I see though. That's my little way of sending some love!
---
Maybe. I don't know because I haven't messed with workshops since it happened that one time.
---
Wtf are we turning this game into GTA online now? What’s next, a flying motorbike and clothing stores?
---
I believe they’re Enclave created. In the Science Wing of the Enclave Bunker there’s a wall with pictures of all their experiments... including the sloth IIRC
---
Sometimes they do, they are giving out wall decoration portraits of Todd Howard all next week.
---
What if the vaguely worded "increased utility" of the backpacks isn't actually increasing your carrying capacity but instead function as a conduit to your CAMP stash making them not exactly useless but not nearly as neat as I think most players would want them to be.
---
A few updates ago I lost my plasma projectiles on my Gatling Plasma. My accuracy has gone down considerably because I can’t lead my shots anymore.
---
By any means no. It’s just a way to add a feature that we all really seem to want. And add more content to a feature that will see a lot of traffic. 
---
You can't join recent players that are neither your friends nor part of your group, or am I missing something?
---
There are no laws, at least in the US or Canada that prevent kids from playing any games. Some local areas may have laws requiring them to show ID but those are few and far between and most places just do it as part of company policy for good PR.
---
 ESRB ratings are not law either, they're not even controlled by a government agency, it's an internal rating system run within the gaming industry. It's used so parents who have little to no knowledge about games can make decisions about what games they think their kids can personally handle.
---
They can be useful for trading and helping others.
---
I fully agree, it is the same when I use the steaks as a food source to increase my carrying weight if I have just consumed one before I log off or get disconnected (which is happening fairly regular now) then when I log back in I still have the rad worms but my weight has reverted back so I have to consume another one.
---
I have one I can toss you. PSN: EddyNasty
---
It takes a little bit (minutes) for it to reload, and 3-5 projectiles are fired. In the past before the camp budget update, you could have many. I had 8 and the barrage lasted for 5 minutes. 
---
This system is pretty bare bones. It wouldn't take all that long, and would make the game just a little bit more smooth as a result
---
I have had to leave the lobby and join a new one for it to work. Half the time the requirement or the drink changes because its glitched
---
Like accessing some of your stash on the fly but not being able to add to it? Interesting mechanic
---
Give us the choice to pick servers
---
Pretty much a blood bath. I assume it’ll stay that way until the stupid leaderboard is removed. 
---
i like your idea more
---
You can take over a power plant in 15 mins if you pay attention to how to run one. Then grab the workshop and hook up the fusion core generator. Free 100% cores. I toss anything less than 100% away because they’re just no shortage of cores when you make them. 
---
I've definately done if before on Xbox, but most of the time they're either all in the same boat as in their server crashed too, or there is simply no recent players for whatever reason. But you can join strangers games, maybe dependant on their privacy settings?
---
Agree
---
Yes, but it is a super exploited cave bunker that abused a lot of glitches to make the build work. I still think it looks nice.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/YpTzw7x
---
Seems to me the weapon that Scorched was wielding should be the one instanced for everyone. No need for a list.
---
This is so perfect for my style, YES
---
Kids or not, if people don't want online interactions they shouldn't be playing online games.
---
Mercury in the hat?
---
Took all hats off and reloaded the game, must be permanent damage lol
---
Yeah, trying logging out and back in and doing it again. Might help.
---
I never defended the Atom shop. I tolerated itm even liked some of the outfits because of free Atoms, but not any more.
---
The parts of the game I do defend (and will) are the bs that people say about there being no story, and the lore being retconned, and all the world being boring, and all the crap that people who have never played said. Credit where credit is due, the exploration aspect of this game is great. The social side is something I never knew I wanted but I love it. Paid cosmetics? Whatever? Going back on the promise of cosmetics only shop? That's where I raise the flags.
---
Also I do love Fallout in forms and media. so I still love the game, so I am a bit salty about the recent repair kit fiasco, hence my snide remarks about the shop. Will I stop playing and/or make a dramatic post about quitting the game? No, because then I am the only one who loses. I'll be sad if they do go through with the p2w stuff. But I'll play. But I'll sure as hell not spend a single cent in the store. Free Atoms, sure.
---
We all knew this was coming.   Online games like this exist to *squeeze* players.
---
The paradox is that the worse the game does, the harder they squeeze the players that stick around.
---
Darn radiation. 
---
Bloody mess in luck? This effects damage of all weapons. Does one of you have that?
---
Just change your appearance give yourself back your hair.
---
What sense makes the vault door there? Around the space station, i couldn't find anything about the lore, like when it crashed, if people survived the great war and so on. Crashing right onto a vault might be pretty rare. Maybe it was on purpouse to lock the vault or hide it better. Maybe the people on the space station knew the vault and if they can enter it easily and crashed it there, knowing it might be the only possible chance to survive it or they just wanted to seal it off, because the experiment was too bad to get released. Maybe the people inside the vault wanted to secure the entrance better, because they don't wanted to get released by the other vaults and die.  
---
Maybe its Vault 69 and the people on the space station wanted some fun but this leads to the question where Vault 68 is, because i think both might be close together. Maybe these are both vaults and we open just once and the people are so horny, that they randomly appear and try to duck us. Maybe we can see them in the distance, how they try to duck a deathclaw. 
---
It would be interesting and i hope it releases some human NPCs, that we can interact with and learn more about the lore.   
---
They were originally coded for the Atomic Shop when they were first datamined earlier on.
---
Did you ever find an answer to this?
---
It's a blessing from atom
---
Nobody is going to boycott or anything.... but new games come out every day, and a game has to stay good to keep players from turning their head to whatever the new thing is.
---
I enjoy the game.  It’s not perfect, but it’s not as bad as whiners make it sound.
---
The atom shop repair kits?  Not game-breaking at all.  They won’t negatively affect anyone’s gameplay - it’s not a pay-to-win scenario.
---
As for downvotes without replies...suck it up, buttercup.
---
Survival is kill or be killed. You know this. When the event ends, defend yourself. Survival is abusive, it's why I'm not on it. 
---
And the only wig available is a crappy pompadour.  What’s a ghoul to do?   On a serious note, submit a ticket.  That would drive me nuts. 
---
I second this idea.  Maybe we could build a Doppler at our camps or a perk itself would be good.  On the note of weather though I would like darker nights and more intense weather!
---
I’d kill for just 2 extra points..,
---
Starting about a month ago they add a free item every week
---
I can get behind this, it would be more useful than the “dying of rads” vomit emote 
---
store your walls?
---
That is the best suggestion yet.  
---
The fact that VATS will always target friendlies over enemies is baffling. Whoever programmed that needs to be stuck working on radroach lighting effects until further notice.
---
Says no match found
---
The raider armors from FO3 as full body outfits would be badass. 
---
I feel your pain
---
It sucks when I'm checking the power armor spawns and I hear his stupid voice! For not one but 2 events in that area
---
I see your point as valid, I just don't think it's as high a priority as you do. I'd like to see other things prioritized, like fixing food spoilage, fixing the assaultron head damage bug, etc.
---
Interesting thought! What benefits would you hope to reap from that (perk)? 
---
Ahhh, that is it.  He has bloody mess, and I do not.
---
But the sight is pretty hard to see through. All you have to do is place it just left of what you’re shooting and you’ll hit it. 
---
Walk the fence to the left of the terminal. Theres a air purifier you can jump on to go over the fence. Doesn’t require marsupial or anything. 
---
Good run boys 
---
It's been that way for a little while.  I don't know if it's something they intend to do every week.
---
A player base wide collection type of thing would be cool. Like you need to raise a crazy amount of resources and they would build the new bank. 
---
Hanging out in radstorms. I just happen to like the audiovisual effects in them.
---
It means a higher level player entered the server before u
---
Alright dude. Thanks. I wll up my game and try to get more scrap and make shit to scrape. Thank you! 
---
The Giggling Granny
---
Because Bethesda logic.
---
It is awesome scenery for the most part.
---
I've been copy/pasting this whenever I see someone make a post about cross character storage. I just like the idea and keep wanting to share it.
---
I'd  like to see a main menu option for transferring items. A sort of  cross-character stash. By doing it from the main menu it would also keep  the extra items from needing to be loaded on the game servers, which  seems to be an issue the game has and way stash limits we low at the start. A way it could work is:
---
* Main Menu item for I.T.E.M.S Box (Inventory Transfer and Enhanced Management System)
---
* I.T.E.M.S opens up a menu with all items in it on the right and your currently selected character's S.T.A.S.H. on the left.
---
* From here you can move inventory between STASH and ITEMS. Since it's not on a game server, there's no worry about large quantities of items hurting much.
---
* The I.T.E.M.S. box would be tied to the player (not character) allowing all your of your characters to share the same I.T.E.M.S. box inventory.
---
* There would be no reason to limit what you could put here other than to try and keep the illusion of scarcity in a post apocalyptic world so hoarders could rejoice.
---
The first bug they encounter was hilarious, the same thing happened to me my first time.
---
I agree it's not high priority, but it's one of those quality of life things that bugs me sometimes. But what's the assaultron head bug ?
---
It's because u had two of the same hat or headpiece and I equipped one of them..put in any other headpiece and take it off..problem-solved
---
Cloth is great for making the CW hat though
---
I totally gatling snipe in 3rd person 
---
Nicely done 
---
I haven't had any trouble. Just keep your camp hidden, and removed from any fast travel points. The mire is a great place. 
---
Also, if you make it into the top 3, don't stay in your camp for too long or else it will be found and destroyed.
---
That sounds good. Lower carry capacity and you lose some ap. Higher and you lose more ap. Highest and you lose all of it. Then again, I don't see Bethesda leveraging being able to use vats against, well, anything. 
---
And good to know I have them all for lever, than you! 
---
What level are u
---
My belief is one of two things: Either the backpack is either a direct link to your stash and functions fully as such (lame, imho) or it's a carrying capacity/stash hybrid: you get another ~50 pounds of portable storage but you can't draw weapons or aid items directly from it but neither do you lose anything stored in your backpack on death. It'd be a great addition to survival mode where safely carrying any quantity of junk or aid to and fro is an ethereal concept at best.
---
If you have the resources and the ability to craft them I suggest crafting the armor or guns with the super duper perk equipped.
---
30% chance to get an extra item free and just scrap em all ti get the mods.  I did that and that how I was able to get the buttressed mod for my marine arms
---
And look for armor that has mods you want out in the wastes.  I've noticed if I scrap armor with mods already on it theres a chance to learn the mod it has.
---
So was it confirmed that Bloody Mess was the difference?
---
Ah don’t feel bad. I’ve bought games at full price before and played them for a couple of hours before realising they’re not for me. Money down the pan.
---
Regardless, it sounds like you’ve got your money’s worth.
---
Make a quest. 
---
Meet *insert clever weather robot name*
---
Build a weather radio, beacon, and terminal. 
---
Radio installs on Pip-Boy so you can listen to cheesy music and weather facts why being told when and where stuff is.  
---
The beacon is fired into the sky and measures the weather with varied predictions. 
---
The terminal is for logging data. 
---
No new perk and still have same function. 
---
But good idea. 
---
Don't mean insult good Intel, but der :P
---
I think the Grafton Mayor is worse, if only because you graze the radius of his stupid events every time you go to the Grafton Station vendor and you'll typically trigger his events twice if you go from there to the inner Grafton vendor.  His voice, which is sometimes processed and other times isn't, is also a poor fit for a Fallout game.  Both him and Sanjay sound like Saturday morning cartoon characters.
---
There is some really great voice acting in the game from the Overseer, Abbie, and a few others.  I can't help but feel it's undermined by these other, more frequently heard characters.
---
Yup. A blue plan and a red plan spawn. You SHOULD be able to get both, but I wouldn’t risk it. Maybe took 10-15 hops before BoS legs popped. I was so happy
---
I basically only ever use the finger guns emote.
---
They made it so it doesn’t eat all your ammo, but it does so much damage it gets the damage bug (all damage is reversed). Still an unusable gun
---
Also..the mr fuzzy costume and mask is a dope flex..as well as the hunters longcoat , flight helmet, BOS hood, and medical goggles..BOS fatigues, BOS underarmor (both), military fatigues, ranger hat is 🔥as well
---
I remember seeing a scorched running around with a flamer. He’d hold it by the nozzle and beat people with the tank.
---
I prefer the DCG. I think it swings faster and the difference in damage is negligible.
---
It works well in eso
---
Hey I'm lvl 200 and I just noticed haven't really scrapped until the uh recently buffed the scrapper so scuuuse me Mr.:b
---
Downside: Makes everything look even more washed out of color than it already is. Vision reduced to 20/100.
---
I’ve avoided survival and that’s one of the reasons why. I can’t stash my aid items cause I have too much and it’s full. That might get me in to trying it
---
Yep, that's what I did when I got a 6,300 cap bounty put on me. I found someone on the subreddit who would kill me and split the bounty with me.
---
Its really not abusive once you learn how to handle it. When my timer gets too high i go home, make a staircase and jump off killing it to reset my timer and bam good to go. Double xp right now has made it excellent.
---
If you don't play it you really shouldn't think you understand it on more than a base level. Ive met many players who do not kill you on the spot. Ive also learned how to deal with fast travel farmers and event hunters. 
---
Killing after an event is not the problem. Its that players  need at least a few seconds to fast travel out after one of survival will only be about pvp which it isnt meant to be. (Just look at the weekly quests, none of them are even pvp related)
---
There are perks that lower the weight of weapons and aid items and ammo
---
Also you can save and buy calibrated shocks for your excavator armor, which gives you an extra 100 to play with
---
Launched my first nuke today too. I thought it might be way harder. I just used my sword, a gatling gun and a Laser rifle. I thought it might cost way more ammo and i might strugeling with condition and so on. I launched it at whitesprings but didn't found that much of interest. The enemys where pretty rare and i only was able to stabilize one flux, because people where stealing the stuff. Don't know if it was the wrong time or so. Sadly i missed the impact, because i needed to go to my camp first to store stuff away. Probably it would be better to go right to the train station.   
---
Doing it alone is a great feeling but it would be probably better to have people to play with and doing stuff together but i'm not such a social person, especialy with random people. 
---
Trying is the most important step. 😀
---
I was hoping there would be aliens there. Perhaps several aliens boarded and killed some of the human astronauts. In a last ditch effort to regain control of the station the remaining humans launch a counter attack but lose control of the ship and crash land next to a vault they had been in contact with.
---
Their excuse is probably something about the "in-game economy" or some bullshit.
---
Players have that mutation by default. Why do you think we always fall on our feet when we drop off of a cliff?
---
i think you would enjoy putting a nuke mine right aroundor under the crate
---
The could also be called "Outfits from the Future".
---
We can only try to try 🙊
---
I actually do the opposite and stock up on everything - I pretend I'm a Mini Boss and try to make it challenging for other Players to kill, and I like to put a 1500 Cap Bounty on my Killer. It's like sharing the wealth :)
---
77
---
Lol I'm level 218 or something.. Dunno really. Haven't played in like a few days. High level issues like I have too many caps and in order to motivate to play I have to buy something good. Nothing good I wanna use has come up. 
---
Raven Rock/Mt Weather.
---
I'll be on in a couple hours..I think we t gonna be doing SBQ about 4 times
---
I have a camp with crops and water that is a self sustaining and completely safe. You are welcome to take a look if you are on xbox.
---
Found BOS chest plan on a random wendigo at Smith Farm in Toxic Valley. So the item exists in whatever loot pool that area RNGs from
---
Just take over and defend workshops. You’re almost always given a bunch of stimpaks. 
---
I wish I was drowning in caps.  I spend too much caps for weapons and other things I decide I dont want.
---
I'm not very responsible
---
Haha same. All I needed was the stimpacks I brought with me. Also missed the impact because I had to unload weight. I've seen plenty of others though, so no problem. I'm also not a very social person so I understand!
---
I'll give u 1k for the bloodied plasma
---
It's on the way. Wouldn't surprise me if that was one reason to put off player vending.
---
&gt; dropping at a 0.03% rate from Scorch Beast Queens.
---
Still better than the rare Farsnatch masks lol
---
Yeah, that would make the most sense as to why they pushed player vending back.
---
Did u do this already
---
oh my god I'm dying
---
And become more successful in the process.
---
I've been having tons of trouble with Imgur lately, it's not just you.  If I change the 'gallery' to 'a' I can see 1 picture on most posts.
---
Worked for me only for sneak melee attack... NOT sneak shooting attack
---
You saying there should be laws governing parents to following your definition of morality is the very example of telling parents how to raise their children. 
---
 Cool.
---
Hope fore the best haha. But no really I'm going to start making friends so I can have a group to raid with in future! And now I know how Nukes work I won't look like a complete noob so that's a bonus haha
---
you have that wording backwards i believe you want it instanced
---
Use the 200% perk whenever repairing and use gunsmith it slows the breaking by like 60%
---
See, the last few times I've done AWOL Armaments, I haven't had a Legendary show up at all.  The same thing happens with Census Violence and the Enclave Bots on Parade quests.  Sometimes there will be one, other times nothing.
---
The only event that's a guaranteed 3\* for me is One Violent Night, which is why I end up doing it whenever I can.
---
Can't you just die, respawn, and it's gone?
---
I only have one of those hats, but when I took it off another hat was still on.. Took about 4 times loading in without anything on my head to get it back to normal
---
Why were the Thunder deployed in Appalachia?
---
You get a 25% buff to damage but also suffer an accuracy penalty.  It’s still a good effect but they nerfed it awhile ago... used to do 2x the damage (2 bullets)
---
I have gunsmith maxed..I guess I need 200%..thx bruh
---
No worries pal. Got to stick together in the wasteland :)
---
I have no joke 166. Bring in the bulk goods!!!
---
This happens to me a lot..if u mess with it..like store it in your stash and then back in your inventory..ur next server reset should cure it..it gets glitchy sometimes
---
Who was the Lead Instructor at V E S T.?
---
This is my recommendation for all people until they add this feature. I'll always just throw out a couple of team invites to people when I know I'm actually going to be playing for a bit, makes it a lot easier to rejoin if I accidentally glitch out. Transfers the workshop ownership over to the new team leaders but when they leave, it goes back to you. 
---
Makes doing SBQ a lot easier, even though seems like those are getting rare these days. Even white springs nukes are down. Might have to finally go complete the nuke myself just to get another queen drop. 
---
INDEED FELLOW AMERICAN
---
This is Son E. Skies, Appalachia's Eyebot in the sky. Today in the mire we have a 2% chance of sun with intermittent radstorms throughout the day. For those in the Toxic Valley though, its time to put on your swimsuits and gasmasks. With an expected high of 300° and not a cloud in site. Stay tuned for future updates. Now we will go to our survival pro Techie Ron.
---
What's fallout without a few glitches to keep it interesting lol
---
Take an upvote. 👍
---
Im currently in the process of modding the hell out of my TSE handmade. Should I invest in modding the combat rifle too? It has a damage value of 80, which compared to my handmade’s 129 DMG and my lever action’s 134 DMG is... not very good. 
---
I really love Fallout. I bought a tricentennial edition, and a copy for my girlfriend. Even with all its flawes i like playing F76. I hate beeing lied, and where the implementation of this p2w crap leads...
---
But we can send a warning to bethesda: I have suspended playing Fallout 76 at least until Bethesda adresses this backlash and correct it's decision (Hopefully this week with the next inside the vault). I hope many other fans will join me. If they see a significant player drop of next week, it might persuade them to reconsider...
---
For me personally, if they decide to integrate the repair kits to the atom store, i'am considering leaving F76 for good. It does not make fun, if you wonder why gear breaks so fast, food spoils so fast or whatever if they always can sell you the solution on the atomic shop. Then imbalance is no more Work in progress but a business decision. 
---
I'm usually down to play - add "QuasarSilva" and feel free to join in when I'm online!
---
I find my bloodied explosive combat shotgun breaks super quick too I think they fucked the rate up or something I can’t even play for a half hour with a 200% repair I swear lol 
---
Yup- when I had my CAMP on that little dam there, used to take pot shots at it sometimes. Pretty consistently spawns there. Right after a truck with a safe in it, and another small pickup. Often times you'll be running down that road and just see two cars there but it's like oh crap...one of them is moving. 
---
Same. Worse when it's a bloodbug. Impossible to find. Even more so of it's a pile of ash or in pieces. 
---
I hope they come with an option to hide them, the one shown was very ugly!
---
i would love to see  all the wall types and such from FO4 and its DLC's
---
if it is the one with +1 perception, it just breaks fast as shit.
---
Yeah that was my inspiration first. But then I wanted to go higher. Here's an album I just put together: https://imgur.com/a/5ItMsnE
---
Yeah I tried this too. I did a sneak punch, sneak sword, sneak ripper. They didn't work. I did a sneak vats, sneak scope, sneak hip fire. Nothing worked lol 
---
So I let it set over night and it worked this morning. 
---
Yeah I am aware with that however with that being said it's not like this is removing something and making it pay to win the game went 5 months without a repair kit I don't think it will die because they made it pay to win
---
Lol it drives me nuts..only half way into beating the queen it breaks..gun is such a beast tho
---
Ha..I wish..it's a 2*
---
You gotta shove these bobbleheads way up your butt /u/OldMrAbernathy  , waay up there.
---
I do kno that wearing different hats will cure it tho..equipping then unequipping
---
Can this game please die a slow death?? 
---
I use the mod to do it on PC. It's a tiny bit powerful so I can see why they haven't done it yet.
---
When fighting the SBQ I have a loadout for rifles including damage perks and VATS targeting. Let's me do great damage while she's flying. As soon as I see her go into her landing animation I hit Tab-&gt;T-&gt;2-&gt;Esc. Boom, just as she lands I'm fully respec'd into huge unarmed damage. Took 2 seconds max to do it. I do this all the time when swapping between weapons in different scenarios. I also use it to keep weight reduction perks on and quick swap to damage and defense builds as soon as I see enemies. With how quick I can swap, I'm half sure I could use it in PvP provided I could find cover for 2-3 seconds.
---
If there was a vanilla one, it would be best to only have it usable only at team C.A.M.P.S. or Workshops although the PC mod makes it a moot point unless they issued bans for bypassing game mechanics.
---
Likely. Not sure. My best vampire weapons are an SMG and swing speed switchblade. The enemy has a tough time doing more damage than the rate I can heal. I had a shotgun and frankly didn’t notice much with the vampire designation. 
---
I tried that but sadly to no avail.
---
Pros: improved low light vision and either: rodents below your level flee in terror or +2 agility 
---
Cons: -2 STR and increased damage from canines.
---
Two shot is one of my least favorite ones to pair with a vats build. Just my 2 cents. 🙄
---
Why is that?
---
If the only effect is the two shot, I wouldn’t build around it.  I have a two shot handmade that I don’t really use, preferring to use a ghoul slayer since I do whitesprings a lot.  I have a gauss rifle for sniping and that ghoulish handmade for close up.  I hear the lever action can be quite good for range.... sounds like you don’t really need the combat rifle if it’s just a 1*
---
They appear at max level, on whatever character you happen to be using, and you can trade it.
---
I think the repair kits are more meant for the pvp servers to quickly repair your gear in a bind. Not so much a pay to win thing
---
I’ll have to find some place to sell it then
---
dope..add me iihatefaces 
---
also give the pump action the sights that are unavailable
---
Just because I don't do Survival doesn't mean I haven't done it. I made #1 on my server a couple times. I just don't like the attitude there. 
---
You not being killed is nice, but most people don't seem to have that experience, and I certainly watched a bunch of people get killed right out of the vault. 
---
I've watched people camping the Overseer CAMP. 
---
I've read tons of posts about people being killed over and over and over and over and over before they even load in enough to bug out. 
---
I don't do Survival now, because I don't want to deal with that. 
---
Events like SBQ are what they are. If other people can start killing as soon as the event is over, so can you.
---
You miss a lot more shots in vats with 2 shot. 
---
Deck would be a good name if you could come up with a decent acronym for it.
---
I like PACK: Perk Adjustment and Construction Kit
---
It is. It also spawns a Mothman as an encounter, got two of him last night when farming. Was finally arrived to complete the kill each cryptid challenge as well felt good. 
---
Would be nice but I doubt it. Logically it’s weird to hide a backpack lol. Plus more incentive to buy skins from atom store
---
When you load up the game it can sometimes take a bit of time to load.
---
It already has on a lot of items. Take serums for example. I could say I'll sell you any serum for 300c/each, 250c if buying bulk. I guarantee someone would pop in the same post and undercut by 100 caps within minutes. I've seen people undercut as low as 75c per serum and the damn things contain 1 flux per!
---
When I say continual, I mean *continual*...
---
I second, thrice and fourth this.
---
i realy hate being forced to use voicechat. One reason being that my main-gamingtime is when the rest of the Family is asleep, another being that i dont have a propper microphone and last but not least i Sound totaly ridicolous through voicechat. Like a Heliumfilled hamster getting stepped on by an elephant.
---
I wish
---
They also increased spoilage on food items to like 4 minutes soyou shouldn't bother carrying them any more
---
Nice, I didn't know *he* spawned there too, probably jumped 100 times there and haven't had *him* pop up yet.
---
It’s worse. They lose 40 and you lose 300.
---
Yep that was it.
---
The problem is that they start with repair kits (it's not very important) and continue with more important stuff. They said that Atomic Shop Will contain only cosmetics or CAMP stuff, and here it is, the first P2W item
---
I mentioned this last night on the thread about weapons not being loaded when you jump servers/fast travel.   I've had this happen for a while now.  I have to make sure everything is working now (bullet loaded, last used weapon is on the hotkey). So...  yes. This is an issue!
---
Pay to resolve a minor inconvenience doesn't roll off the tongue quite as well. I suppose if you plan on just sitting on a train station roof all day I can see an advantage.
---
Thanks, Went with the DCG!
---
Dweller. Engineered. Card. Kits
---
Yeah use the weapon artisan perk (max it out) when repairing weapons, it's been working great for me.. 
---
I tried the team trick the other day when I got stuck but didn't have the option to rejoin with my team. It would only give me the option to join with "friends."
---
I, personally, would just sell the combat rifle. Even  with legendary effects the combat rifle, and assault rifle for that matter, kinda suck. 
---
We will know exactly when and what when released. Roadmap says May 23rd.
---
You have to look up their profile on Xbox, and join them there. 
---
You were never meant to be able to buy everything with just playing the game. I mean technically you could but that would undercut the point of the atom shop.
---
This isn't rocket science, but you are doing your best to make it seem like it's.
---
If that's true we can expect an atom-store item to buy that will temporarily "fix" it soon
---
Instead of cat eyes it can be called feline mutation  :o
---
Dang that’s sweet
---
🙄
---
I'm in the same boat at level 240. But there's plenty of reasons to do any and all events without them spawning a 3 star. I never have to farm for healing supplies. Almost never have to make ammo. Never worry about purified water. I get mods unlocked faster than scrapping. I get caps, junk, mods, plans. Doing those other supposedly worthless events gives me more basic supplies than I need. Which leaves more time and less grind to do those precious few that offer top level gear. 
---
Your asking them to cater the game to your own priorities.  
---
Trying to upvote more than once.
---
I wasn't expecting him, honestly. Seen a Dark figure and big red eyes, knew it was him. Shot him with my sniper and he poofed. Server hopped, and there he was again in my next instance. This time he wasn't getting away and used my TS Fatman and one shot him. I wanted to be sure. Didn't get the Responder vendor but I did get 40 atoms from it. 
---
What legendary effects are better for my build?
---
Quick make new accounts. 
---
That’s no joke. I have that one, I’m lucky to get an hour out of it in a nuke zone, even from 200%. 
---
I might do that. I think a steep fee would be critical to keep it from being abused...instead of having all your vendor-loot in one spot at the end of the day, it's only there so you have the chance to get that missed plan or 3* legendary. 
---
What a massive improvement for BL1! I fired up my ps3 to export old characters( it looked very dated) to my ps4. Wow, what a joy returning to play BL1 again. A couple co-op inventory bugs but major creature comfort improvements. 
---
I downvoted to bury this post forever. 
---
I think the most unfortunate part of the change is  that enemies cant use the legendary drop they are holding like they did in 4. I will never forget the nightmare of fighting with a supermutant primus with an explosive minigun.
---
I remember my first solo attempt. I, like you, have no friends so it was really my only option. I did it unarmed melee, so I used a bit less ammo than you did.
---
The worst part was I don't use PA, so when the rad area came about I was about 80% in the red and ran out of Rad-Away. Had to redo my entire perk setup to one that worked with high rads/low life. Was a great experience. Congrats.
---
Because you have to apply salt. 
---
Junk rat. Can consume scraps and can see all loot piles. Normal food does not help with hunger
---
This exact thing happened to me at the antique shop. I was so disheartened to be one ant off.
---
Yep...after capturing several places and have multiple mining facilities running...then server crashes out and I lose all my shit, the caps I spent, all of it...kinda lame
---
there was no indication that they would break there promise of never putting non-cosmetic items in the shop. You can only indicate a certain greed from this behavior. Lets be honest here, we are getting less and less content with each new generation of games. content is gated of to DLC's, ingame shops, players are throtteled down, you get half the game with the standard edition today. Games make today more and more money from less content. And if all the f\*\*\*\*\*g money in the world is not enough they just lay of some people...
---
Skyrim's never been fixed either and how long ago has it been released? 
---
Do you have chameleon armour on? I had to take it off and land a sneak without it to get it to register
---
Yeah I thought that was the case but for him to say its unfair to the lower levels?
---
I'd love a rustic log cabin in the forest zone. 
---
Lol sounds like yours was a self imposed challenge. That's crazy times haha. I came with sooo much stuff I didn't need, but least I know next time I can take it a little easy with the inventory. Respect for your efforts!
---
They kept attacking my claimed munitions factory workshop, even though they're supposedly not in the game yet. 
---
Only thing we've been told is that we'll be able to scrap and sell legendaries and that it takes * levels into account  somehow. 
---
Most recent interview there was reference to being able to do something to make a desired result more likely somehow. No real details on that.
---
There's assumptions that it's some sort of ticket or token system, so myself and many others have started hoarding otherwise low value legendaries.
---
It's not a solution but general advice to help mitigate the problem, put a rad suit in your favorites wheel. Until such time as the issues is addressed it's the best way to keep from dying from that situation when you're not a PA user.
---
FO3 and FONV allowed caps to be stored in containers I kinda forget why that was used... 
---
Sweet! I was going to throw in that for me, as I gained Levels Enemies grew weaker, and that the Rifleman build is a 'Late Bloomer' in my opinion coming into it's own at around Level 80 with a good Legendary.
---
Man the first time the mothman saw me was around launch.
---
I was coming up behind the castle in Berkeley Springs, crouched level 15 aneaking along when I see [caution]
---
"I'm on a cliff with nothing behind me? Maybe the game is bugged?? " see a black mass on the tower of the castle. "What is that" scope in, name pops "Stalking Mothman" "Mothman is in this game? That's co-" 
---
Flies up in a cloud of black and a sonic boom.
---
"Shit I guess the Mothman is super mysteri-
---
Massive impact behind me, blue force bubble spreads everywhere, he screeches me into oblivion.
---
Pull out my Kremvhs Tooth machete " let's go Mothman!"
---
He annihilated me and disappeared.
---
He has hunted ever since.
---
Mad respect for the Mothman ever since.
---
Haha So you actually saw them? Was hoping to get a look but didn't get the chance
---

This week, Charlie is 35775253.
---
I was 'meh' until your last sentence then you got me 100% on board.
---
Anti armor or bloodied if you’re a low health build. 
---
Know the feeling and it sux, it even occurs in Adventure. Its horseshit. Its a wasteland, survival of the fittest imo!!
---
Yeah man I feel it. This happened to me (solo, ammo,time, resources, etc all lost) about 3 weeks ago and I haven't played it since 
---
And the point of this post for the umpteenth time is to send feedback to improve survival so more people want to play it... people who like it but want it better, so you don't belong in this conversation.
---
Thanks, I may swing by. I’m Xbox too. 
---
Can I join? I’m level 63 
---
GT:ItsCharlie141
---
It's a system designed to prevent one shot kills, so automatic weapons are most heavily affected. 
---
Health goes up but not 100% each time, simply because you're trying to do too much damage all at once. 
---
It's not a "bug" it's the intended results, which you and many don't like but it's not something broken. 
---
Thanks for the PM, added to the show. Listen for your shout out. May use the megaton question, too. 
---
You can just open the exchange item menu on a corpse and see that there is a shit load of gear you can't see. A super mutant usually has something like 56/0 for weight and all you can see is a hunting rifle, 4 rounds, and a cap.
---
Apparently its notnsurvival of the fittest but instead survival of the sweet spot between powerful enough to rebuffed and and weak enough not to.
---
That was initial thought. A P2W item. Pay 2 Want. 
---
Yea, they gotta fix that. 
---
so you see 1 frame per second or does it completely stop (freezes) then crash?
---
yep same with the laser musket there quite a few FO4 cut weapons that are still in the games files/FO4 that isnt in FO76
---
Watch the video. His health returned to the level it was before I shot over and over. It is absolutley broken. There is a difference between not one shotting and only doing 1 damage per shot with an endgame weapon because you are too strong 
---
Everything is overpriced as is due to duping. Give it some time and it’ll come off it’s high. 
---
I’ve found the mod for it at the Watoga station a couple times. Haven’t been able to find it recently though
---
Anytime 
---
L O L
---
Except it's not Pay to Win. YES they lied and it's not  a cosmetic. Its a pretty minor convenience. The ones from the Atomic shop only repair to 100%, which is less than the ones you will get in game that do 150%, and both are less than the 200% that you can do with perks at a workstation
---
I built my camp on the lake at the middle/ bottom of the map and there was this beautiful cabin through the woods next to the lake that taunted me. I had to move because my camp wasn't nearly as majestic as it no matter what I did :(. 
---
Well, most stable flux sells for \~30 caps each. Only violet is significantly more expensive. 
---
Surprised people are willing to do trades for 75 caps though: It'd be less hassle to run through a couple of cap stashes.
---
Ammosmith+super duper=insane amounts of ammo
---
Looks great, thanks for posting pics. 
---
Well they told me never to ring them if I was in jail, ergo I should ring them before the cops get involved :p
---
They would still probably kick my ass though.
---
This! Todd himself said "you'll not even see a server", but it's constantly thrown at our faces that we depend on servers and just by disconnecting for a few seconds, the losses can be tremendously game breaking. I don't know how many times I just secured a workshop just to have the game die on me or get disconnected. I just stop playing. Actually, that's what happened to me the last time I played, like two weeks ago. Didn't even got the desire to play thee game anymore after that. It's disheartening. Joy killer.
---
Smoker / jerky hut CAMP item when???
---
Is it still at random I thought all vendors had set items 
---
And an endgame player going after Lvl 4s should be incredibly nerfed because that either makes the person a bully or an ass. 
---
It is far less nerfed against another end game character. So I don't understand the point. 
---
Also yes, a lvl 200 has had 120 more levels worth of experience and time to farm weapons and gear and caps, so of course they should be expected to not lose to what is assumed a less experienced, less equipped player. 
---
Weapon artisan is a must. Also check the weapon mods as the setup might be reducing it's lifespan. Easiest way to improve it, if you haven't already, is change the stock, usually to forceful I think ( improved bashing one ). Won't really affect performance but usually makes a massive increase on weapons total health.
---
Once in awhile a gem of an idea.....
---
No idea. 
---
First the eyes....then the videos
---
Video games prices have changed. New releases used to be around £40 in the UK (£50 for some).
---
Now that's £60. Then there's the season pass, another £30, or the Gold, silver or Deluxe versions of games. Games easily cost £80-100 today.
---
Your argument has been debunked thoroughly previously.
---
I mean, it's not a real P2W, but if they introduce elements like this and everyone is happy, they'll probably sell other real p2w ítems in the future
---
Weird.  I checked it on my phone ten minutes ago and it worked.  But I'm back on the computer now and neither link works.  I would explain why, but I don't use Imgur enough to know :-)
---
Just found your post dont know why I got downvoted. Honestly weapon artisan is a god send for most weapons but in the issue I had weapon artisan just barely extended my weapon life at the time.  But I do appreciate that advice it was helpful even if I didnt need it
---
Thx bruh I will have my boy mod it for that 
---
I will post another video then. The same thing happened between myself and a lvl 84, and 84s are just as strong as anyone else. It isn't level based at all like you say, it's just an overarching bug. And to the last thing you said a lvl 2oo and lvl 80 have pretty much the same gear as everyone has the same lvl gear, perks, and special after 50.
---
Even with perks, I played overburdened for like 40 levels before quitting this stupid game at level 85 or something. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
It's so disappointing :(
---
Wait a minute, I thought this is either a visual bug or some kind of auto stim armor! So in fact, I’m dealing too much damage and this new one-shot-mechanic triggers?
---
Won't it be similar to those? Maybe not as many people as in WoW, but other than that I don't see why not call those raids.
---
It could be just me but it seems 2shot weapons in general break a lot faster relative to other similar weapons without the effect
---
I'd definitely be interested in seeing this vs someone of higher levels and with different weapons because if it's a bug more experimenting is required to see what is actually broken vs what is just intended results of the devs that might need adjustments. 
---
The Virginian Virgin
---
I thought the dupe wars were over???
---
Correct. They stated that it was intentionally added to Survival mode to prevent Someone from just one shot killing everyone. 
---
wait till you see them beat you with the barrel of a minigun then drop a combat knife.
---
I am glad that you mentioned this. I wasn't sure if it was an issue with server hopping (which causes it to forget too). It is a minor, but annoying inconvenience. It usually happens in a similar situation with me. I hop out of my armor to use a workbench, and then I come to an area where with feral ghouls, or scorched and reach for my Tesla Rifle... oh wait it's not equipped. Ouch.
---
Subjective I know, but how is it not?  It's like buying XP Booster packs because grind is horrible (Not in this game, but others).  If you are able to run along much longer and cough up a couple dollars real cash then it gives you an unfair advantage.  Turn it into PVP focus and you can clearly see someone with a bank roll can quickly repair gear while in prolonged fights while someone without can not.
---
If they want to FIX it then these should be craftable in game.  Problem mostly goes away, but is still lopsided cash grab and unfair advantage.  
---
What are we winning? 
---
i had seen a the death claw at the pwoerstation near watoga run away from the ants and chased it from the cran berry bog to the mire
---
S A N J A Y H E R E !
---
Coming soon to an Atomic Shop near you...
---
Just a heads up I just got my shower the other day and it takes a bunch of flux to repair as well! Someone came and destroyed mine before I even got to use it and had no more flux to repair it. I store it now when I’m not there. 
---
If you’re just carrying a bunch of salt around, should it negatively affect your health?
---
considering how its only 0 stars who do this i can assume that they are just legendary cowards
---
The repair kit is the first step. This is a sort of "testing the waters" thing. Judge the outrage, see what they can get away with. If they start with this, it gets worse and worse because each subsequent addition is seen as not being much more of a problem than the previous item. So people don't get as mad. 
---
It progresses, and soon there's unique, powerful gear you can only get in the atom shop.
---
I am level 115 and was at full health both times I got one shot.  So something is still not right.
---
My TSE handmade does not break as quickly 
---
Yeah the plan list definitely seems to have either fixed or the chance of these items were increased as of patch 7. I am getting tons of plans where I should have gotten earlier in the game. Congratz on those plans since I haven't found them yet (lvl 200). 
---
Bethesday confirmed racist!!!11!
---
They have the tech support guy as....Sanjay!  
---
I feel you on this, im tired of putting countless hours and materials into building up a workshop just to have the game crash n lose EVERYTHING i worked on, this is one of the main reasons i dont really play it all that often 
---
It's not really like buying an XP buff
---
The Bobbleheads are stuck on your helmet ;)
---
Mole rats are the assassins of the wasteland. While you played soccer in the vault, they studied the blade.
---
Moving your camp will fully restore all broken objects with no material cost. Move your camp like an inch and your Decontamination Arch will be good as new.
---
Although placing everything back into their original spots can be annoying. 
---
What weapon were they using? Do you know for certain it was a single bullet or could they have been using an automatic?
---
lvl 426 here. Had to start new character to play survival.
---
Using bugs to work around bugs. The Bethesda way.
---
A friend wanted me to ask what was the strangest?
---
Give me your caps.  I will be your bank.
---
Definitely not
---
Exactly 
---
&gt;Only thing we've been told is that we'll be able to scrap and sell legendaries and that it takes \* levels into account  somehow.Most recent interview there was reference to being able to do something to make a desired result more likely somehow. No real details on that.There's assumptions that it's some sort of ticket or token system, so myself and many others have started hoarding otherwise low value legendaries.
---
ive been doing this since release since i assumed that this would be a feature eventually
---
I just want to play with all the cool xbox players I see on here. Idgaf about fortnite crossplay, give me minecraft and fallout crossplay, sony
---
My biggest gripe too!! My husband is so sick of hearing me complain about this. I'm so happy to see I'm not the only person that finds this more than just a little annoying. I wish I could upvote this 10000000 times!!!
---
It shouldn’t take long to hold your breath and normally you’ll have lots of AP; getting longer breath is completely a waste, at least for me. And I agree on 1/3 conc shot, that’s why I didn’t say dump it entirely :) I’ve heard different things about it boosting damage; I see the accuracy boost and take advantage of it sometimes, but I’m not sure if the baseline boost from long shot would make up the difference anyway.
---
Not sure how you went down in one hit. Unless you were open for PVP. 
---
Please Bethesda. you told us, that there will never be non-cosmetic items in the atoms shop. Pete Hines said, they would not cross that line. Now, this is just the beginning of pay-to-win. I'am scared, that this is just the start of the end of this game. For me it certainly will be. If this is going p2w i will stop playing, because it sucks the fun out of Fallout 76. 
---
From here on, Every imbalance will be not a fault but a business decision. Food spoils to fast, we have to solution for only 4.99 USD a week. New questline to hard? Buy a damage buff for only 3.99 per 24 hours.
---
No Bethesda, from now you have lost my support. I will be very cautious if a buy another BGS game. And certainly i will never buy the premium Pre-sale with another copy for my girlfriend before a game even launches...
---
You will lose so many fans that it will seriously hurt Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6 and even the next Fallout.
---
Just a text glitch. Been happening for weeks. 
---
the crosshair disappearing isn't a bug, you are "aiming down the sights" so its supposed to go, its just that the heavy weapon "aim down sights" sucks hard
---
Same here. As someone that would always keep their decontamination arch out, never again. I’ve had it destroyed by nukes a couple of times and just by random enemies another time. And breaking from my normal routine to grind for more flux is absurd. So once I get it re-repaired, it’s only getting placed temporarily when I need it. 
---
I guarantee that in real life he'll be dead in 100 years or less. Take solace in knowing this.
---
well it would add a immersive concept to the game rather then a obvious random loot drop it becomes a wow this would be what people actually would have stockpiled
---
they could even make a event out of them - like take 25 requests and merge them at a special location that allows for a mass air drop that players defend while enemies try to shoot down the cargo bots the more of them you keep flying the more of loot you get - would give people more team oriented quests and be a cool use for that cargo bot swarm we see near edge of map sometimes 
---
you can't find without gun. You have to go back to workbench, repair stuff and then keep fighting. Or pay money to bethesda to not pause your fight. It's P2W in my book, or P2P at least
---
Two-shot does fire an extra projectile in a different direction. It seems to be based on weapon accuracy (which is much worse with two-shot weapons), and the spread is much larger with hip-fire than when sighted. I'm not sure how this works with VATS, because you can't shoot walls with VATS.
---
If you land both projectiles, you get 125% nominal damage, or 136% hp damage after the damage resistance calculation is applied. I'm not sure whether a single-projectile hit is always 100%, always 63%, or sometimes 25% and sometimes 100%.
---
Two-shot isn't a great effect now due to the accuracy penalty, but TSE weapons may generate two +20% explosions rather than one. Undocumented mechanics.
---
Oh snap, like the giant ones from Fallout 4?
---
There’s a paid loot box that lets you revert in the store. 
---
If I move my camp it will never go down again. 
---
I'd love the log cabin / the industrial pods we see (white and yellow not sure what they are called) and the bunker style concrete 
---
also windows should have a broken and unbroken version on any build (and brick houses should have glass or no glass)
---
Whats SBQ?
---
In one of the mansions there is a habit for them. The series of cages and accompanying holotape suggests that there were a large number and some how came in contact with FEV contaminated material. The result is what we see in the wasteland. The science is a little shaky but it removed my confusion.
---
Wondering if it was another method they implemented in order to deter server-hopping.
---
Lol nope it seems. Haven’t played since December and people still complaining about the same shit. Almost feel bad for these people.. as someone said in another post the people left playing this game are the battered wives of Bethesda.
---
Well when they bring out the vending machines out where you can create at your is going to be a real big hassle 
---
Yes. Exactly that,  know no that there is a lake that is like a guaranteed spawn.
---
But the first time I saw one I was level 100+ and My camp was on whitesprings.
---
I felt the ground shake and heard a sentry not explode.
---
Went to go see what's up and boom
---
Lvl 80 behemoth and a bunch of lvl 60 warlords.
---
Fun fight, but terrifying experiance.
---
I’d kill for some institute power armor paints, but we probably won’t get them due to it being a few hundred years before the institute was even thought of
---
It's being 'abused' anyway so if they can't stop it why can't they just embrace it?
---
Ooh yeah, forgot about that one. I assumed they had some issues with loading it up (like the assaultron head infinite clip glitch) but then they left the assaultron head anyway and there are even double/quad legendaries of it
---
Believe what you wish.
---
Blueprint would be the alternative. 
---
I dunno. I think this would make the game too easy. If I knew I could just ft back to camp, unload my scrap and gear, and quickly travel to my exact last spot in the wilderness the need to have to ration and occasionally drop stuff to stay within carry weight would be gone. That would strip the game of a lot of its urgency and a vital survival mechanic, imo. 
---
Hi - Level 98 solo player and it's the last thing left for me to do. You might have inspired me to try :)
---
I can't tell if you're joking or not.
---
They probably will make us pay for it hah
---
LOL..  Reinstalled FO4 last night..  Might have to wait for the next major patch to even try again.
---
I’ll invite you 
---
Finally someone says it, I thought it was just me! I've been working my way around this bug a long time, although it's somewhat recent as it started with one of the last
---
Here is how it works and how you can "fix" it (more like working your way around it): Whenever you equip/unequip armor, clothes or even grenades and mines, your "secondary weapon" will unequip and be replaced by your fists.
---
Get inside powerarmor? Fists. Just put on a fancy hat you just found? Fists. Thrown your last Fragmentation Grenade? Yup, also fists.
---
You have to re-equip your "secondary" stored weapon again anytime you do any of this. Sucks but it's the only way around. Put it in your favourite wheel and remember to equipo it back again whenever you change your armor, clothes or throwables.
---
Hope it helps.
---
Convert them to ultracite cores! 
---
Posted another link to this happening with a higher lvl player. No he is not stim spamming as this is in survival where that is not possible. 
---
Vault 68 could be in different state. For example #75 is in Massachusetts, so different state (even if nearby). #87 &amp; #88, #95 &amp; #96, #111 &amp; #112 are different states as well.
---
I’d rather they work on blocking lower level players from entering Scorched Earth, first. Chance of disconnect doesn’t even matter when you can’t do the fucking event because there’s 5 level 40’s standing around in shitty power armor not doing anything except increasing her health pool.
---
I’ve failed after six nuke launches so far because of this shit and let me tell you it got old after the first one. 
---
I was only in the mid 60's when I did it.  You should have no problem. Bring good amount of stims/health and ur good to go!
---
That’s the opposite of what happened with duping.  An influx of items drives the price down. My point was if cross platform happens, there will again be an influx of items and drive down the prices on all items. People aren’t going to pay 5k caps for a serum recipe from a PS4 person if they can get the same thing from someone on Xbox for 2k
---
Lots of assholes play the game. Soon your camp will be safe with pacifist on.
---
And what about entering the game from your  last location and instantly dying of radiation from a blast zone?! Yeah..
---
Should I message you when I start the pc branch. I only just opened the PS4 one so it might be a while 
---
FWIW, I'm 99% sure that level 5-10 legendaries can't have more than 1 effect. I've run Fertile Soil and LEader of the PAck dozens od times and have never seen a legendary item with more than 1 star. I would love to be proven wrong, but I don't think I am.
---
Cool I’ll invite you. Your build would fit a death squad we have 
---
Destroying an object in another player's camp marks you as Wanted, which allows you to attack/be attacked by other players at any time outside of events until the bounty is claimed.
---
Holy mother of Mercy!
---
Yes! Perhaps it could have the "well rested" bonus only last like 20min, forcing you to nap a lot. 
---
Do you know how multiplying works bro? .15 × .15 is .0225. So that means with just 2 pieces I would only have 2% resistance and with one more I would have less than a percent. Your claim literally cant be true.
---
What you all doing to crash the server ? I rarely have had a crash server heck I think it’s been months. HHaha I guess it’s just luck 
---
Upvote this folks
---
You launching soon?
---
I've had the same problem recently, while it was fine before. Haven't found a workaround yet. My internet connection has some minor packet loss so I was wondering if they'd changed the networking when they introduced Survival.
---
Goto nuke zones, kill the mobs. Collect hardened masses, glowing masses, and high radiation fluids. Then run around and pick the nuked flora. 10 raw + 1 each of the masses and fluid will make a stable. Recommend super duper and green thumb.
---
Oh damn
---
Boof it.
---
Stew made out of Communist Chinese spy poop.  Seriously, read the terminals below Mama Dolces....
---
Thats would be funny 😂
---
I have already stopped playing. Suspended for sure the next week. If there is no clarification/comment and rectification i'am considering leaving F76 for good....
---
Looks cuddly.
---
I really want a laughing emoji, it’d help to piss off griefers
---
u/knyfenU 
---
I feel like I remember the issue being that some people were exploiting bobbleheads by server hopping with 15 minutes left on them to reset the counter.  This might have been an overly heavy-handed fix for that.
---
Get the rope!
---
I think it depends on how you would use it. if you were to use it as an automatic or as a short range semi-automatic, I would recommend the furious explosive, however if you were to use it as a sniper I would recommend the two shot explosive.
---
Lever action is my primary sniper. Good rate of fire, good damage, reasonable reload speed. Downsides is it doesn’t have armor piercing mags, so it ends up slightly lower damage than the hunting rifle. But depending on your build, you can hit high enough damage that it doesn’t matter, you’re still oneshotting stuff.
---
Handmade when you aren’t going to be oneshotting things- for me and my bloodied vats sniper build, the handmade comes out only for queen kills; everything else the lever action is more than sufficient for.
---
Lever action is also great because .45 ammo is very plentiful. I haven’t had to craft it in ages. 
---
Looks kinda like a death claw lol. Should be fun!
---
So your saying that if you try to don't much damage the game doesn't let you do any damage? That sounds like a pretty big bug.
---
Cant wait to eat it lol
---
LOL!!
---
G R R R R A A A F T O N ‘ S MA Y O R H E R E
---
STFU and eat shit and die lol SMFH... How about that? This was just about his OP. Which was a question which we have are OWN opinions on. My first was just simple, now this one is very very simple for you a simple minded person I guess "person". So what Facts do have that show that "BY FAR" that PVP is the most popular (LMAO) games in world??? Because that makes complete common knowledge sense when a simple Google search shows the top 3 selling games in history are NOT PVP games...  And I bet you don't know what the 1 PVP game that is in the TOP 5 even is. So before you ever try to think, again cause harm to that poor excuse of gray matter in the otherwise think I am the troll, please just don't. And yes in again as I said IF you could read And listen the LORE of the game says to REBUILD and the OVERSEER says to do what the Others did and kill fight each to the death again... there are even POSTERS with it in the ATOM SHOP you STUPID FUCK!!!  How that for for IN FUCKING GAME LORE!!! DUMB ASS.
---
It doesnt allow you to attack people at will, it means any player can attack you for full damage at any time, the wanted player still only does "slap damage" (which should be 0) to other players unless they attack them
---
The inequity of caps lost is a major reason not to level up, though leveling up is an encouraged.part of the game, hence the atom rewards and extra experience earned in survival.
---
Yeah because 115% flat damage resistance wouldn't heal enemy hit.
---
Its way more complicated, and while I'm not 100% sure how exactly its layered its definitely not additive. Look at this in such way:
---
I do 100 damage in a hit. Then 75% of that is removed, leaving me with 25 damage done. Then 40% of that is removed, leaving me with 15 final damage. This is how it works. How you described it is fundamentally not how it works because its mathematical nonsense.
---
Think of how many shots you expect to take to kill an enemy and go off that. Furious starts off weak and builds up to quite powerful by the 10th shot. Twoshot is max power right off the bat, but degrades faster and has accuracy issues, and max power is lower than furious. From a pure damage perspective, If you’re killing things in 10 shots or less, twoshot will be doing more damage. Past 10, Furious will start to pull ahead. 
---
Doesn't matter. Kids should not be playing mature games to begin with. There is a two reasons why that rating was there. It's to prevent the gaming company from getting sued by ignorant parents and it's also (an attempt) to protect kids from graphic content and terrible influence. Fallout is, in no way, family friendly and all parents should know this and avoid the franchise until their kids are 18 if they actually give a damn about their own child.
---
Man I’ve ran around a few nuke zones today picking stuff and forgot all about green thumb. 😣
---
Desperately want
---
Someone took it then
---
Wouldn't duping make things underpriced?
---
Looks like somebody else may have found it.
---
You should add Grounded to that list. As a melee user you're not missing anything by having reduced energy weapon damage, and the +100 energy resist is super helpful in the silos.
---
Maybe I'm wrong but you definitely are as well.
---
In an interview it was stated that you can scrap legendaries to get tokens. The tokens can the be used to reroll legendary perks or modify legendary weapons. The actual sytem though wasn't discussed.
---
forgot to add, nobody was near it, and if they were they wnt in then out with their only goal to find my stuff
---
I've contracted diseases before from *shooting* a diseased enemy before they can even touch me. It's very inconsistent sometimes.
---
Honestly, I think the haters are still exaggerating the bugs  a bit (as they always have).  I started playing again a few weeks ago and I've only disconnected once since then :) I'd say it's MUCH improved since launch.
---
How about they turn off the smoke after the crate has been emptied. Please.
---
Ahhh.
---
I am surprised more people have not up-voted this one. I have had this happen to me a couple of times. I have even been killed once before I could get into WS, and then get kicked from server. That sucks. You die, lose your loot, and come back to the game glowing. "(Perception) If I listen carefully I can hear my genes crying."
---
Oh man. I completely disagree. I think some kids shouldn’t, but some kids are able to deal with mature themes. I played Fallout 3 when I was 10. I was fine. Never got scarred or anything. Are you saying my father is a bad parent for buying me Fallout 3? I don’t think so. He understood I was mature enough to play a M-Rated game. This is just difference of opinion, obviously. But I think it depends on the child and the parent’s discretion. 
---
By the sounds of it, don't play survival
---
It's pay to win if your on a PvP server and they can fix their gun and you can't 
---
&gt;back to where I was exploring at no extra cost.  
---
This is the bit that would make this OP, I can undertsand travelling back to last location if you cant remeber exactly where you were, but you should pay for it like with every other fast travel
---
It’s killed my love for building defenses or decorating. Every time I make an effort to reinforce the ammo plant the server commits seppuku.
---
Scorchbeast Queen
---
So what it looks like is happening is it detects what it determines to be "too much damage" pauses new damage from being applied until it times out, same timing between when it stopped taking new damage and started again regardless of lvl. 
---
Seems like the damage modifications might need to be adjusted but it's definitely doing what the devs intended. So not a "bug" per se. Just something that might need to be adjusted. 
---
Frankly, they said that they only allowed people to bring their existing characters into survival to test bad interactions and glitches but they eventually intend on having survival "campaigns" where all players are starting new characters, at which point this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
I only use a brand new character for survival, and I'd recommend the same to most people. It's definitely not geared for people rolling in thinking they're going to be God tier, and stomping everyone.
---
Someone else must have been around just off the radar I have that problem sometimes people start stalking me and wait for creatures to kill me then steal my loot bag
---
Imprezobus out
---
Thanks man!
---
Energy weapons still have significant issues. Armor piercing effects don’t work for them. They can’t be silenced. Ammo for plasma weapons is very rare and fairly expensive to craft. Plasma ammo is somewhat heavy. Mods have weird effects and nonsensical ammo counts (going automatic drops the magazine from 30 to 18...) The laser sniper requires a charge-up mechanic like a Gauss (or so I’ve heard, I haven’t actually played with it)
---
Also ash/plasma goo piles can’t be searched with Butcher’s Bounty. 
---
In short, the game is easy enough that with a solid damage build like bloody VATS, you can still make it work, but there’s quite a few ways where it’s sub-par compared to most ballistic options.
---
hrrgh, overseer. i’m trying to sneak around, but i’m dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks is alerting the scorched 
---
Bad luck. I usually fight off molerats. But, could depend on where it lands.
---
The game is an M rating for violence/gore/horror, but the interactions are dependent on real people. Normally, you can see  if the person you're talking to is a kid or not and adjust yourself accordingly. It's impossible to know who is behind the avatar in a video game, though. This is probably a situation where private servers would be ideal. Then the dad could just get a private server for his kid and their friends and let them go to town walled off from any unknown players.
---
Isn’t it the Jersey devil?
---
It's definitely pay to win. Here's an example: you are defending your workshop. You might not have a repair bench, it could be broken or you might not be able to get to it. When your gun breaks you are out of luck. The guy attacking has repair kits and can just fix his gun and keep fighting. The repair kits are definitely p2w and will open the door for more.
---
Would you like to revisit this statement now that repair kits have been revealed to be purchasable through atoms?
---
thats an asshole kind of thing to do xd
---
They added the keyword that blocks Super Duper to all the booze records so no, it does not work.
---
I guess is because every other daily/weekly since the release of this new crafting mechanic has been booze related...
---
Moreover I think they might have crippled Super Duper itself... It doesn't proc for me nearly as often as it did before the DLC release.
---
I’m level 54 and am stuck in what to do as well. All I do these days is hit whitespings, launch nukes and blow bases up😂
---
Just fight people within your level range. Low level people generally won't come after you. So now you both avoid each other.
---
"... It just works!"
---
That’s gunna be neat 
---
It isn't duping. Anyone can buy recipes/plans and make things.
---
There’s an extended bar and a curved bar mod. I forget if they’re learned from scrapping or not, I’ll check later.
---
Btw you’re probably not doing as much damage as you think; the grey is how much damage the queen has taken *in total* while you are damaging her; since you’re constantly damaging her, you’re seeing the sum total of everyone’s damage while you’re attacking. 
---
no
---
Awesome! Thanks for the tip
---
Awww 
---
SSD will shorten load times, but it will not fix the freezes.
---
Xeon 1231v3, 1060GTX, 16GB, SSD
---
Wait until they buff energy weapons to penetrate armour. When that happens, they will be more than viable and may even become a meta
---
Wow that is some bad luck 😂 not normal at all. 
---
Think of it this way. If you over damage your target to a certain degree; all the extra damage past their maximum health will restore. So you want to use something that you have to hit them with twice or more. Like furious stuff.
---
If that's the case, the only explanations I can think of it that OP and the level 40 were in a team and the level 40 initiated PVP with the level 80 or that OP was actually trying to trade with someone on a Survival server. 
---
Normally yes. But if you have something that someone really wants you’ll jack the price up to rake in more. 
---
It’s really not hard to dupe a ton of stuff and sell it to the game and repeat that for a nice profit and then buy enough stuff to push that wealth around filling others pockets. By the time it fills full circle everyone that bought something using those caps can benefit from it. This making the market more priced as they have caps that really shouldn’t be there. 
---
It isn't a duping issue. Players can make serims legitimately. The issue is supply and demand, period.
---
I would be totally down. Lvl 33, GT is Navaru
---
Todays games have less content? Haha you obviously never played old console games. I started on Atari 2600. All games even up to first gen xbox have way less base game content. Hell most old consoles never had DLCs. If you are talking about PC I could care less. Never played PC games and that is a totally different world.  Gamers these days expect more and more from base games and have no idea how lucky they are.
---
Unfortunately gear tops out at level 45 or 50, depending on the type. Pump action shotguns and raider armor top out at 45, for example. At level 50 I jumped into legendary farming. Why not, right? 
---
It isn't working as intended if it is making people invincible man. I get that they didnt want one shots but this what not what they wanted to happen I'm sure.
---
Yeah i found that out today and was disappointed. 
---
I say as they crash let them burn
---
2. They Only spawn in the inventory of the character you competed the challenge in
---
All explosive guns break quicker. TSE will break twice as quick.
---
Funny enough, I recently lost speed demon trying to get rid of an accidentally picked up Empath mutation, and it’s not a big loss for me. But I’m in power armor with a low health build and Emergency Protocols torso, using heavy weapons, so I already have the speed buff from EP, and I don’t reload all that often with heavy weapons. 
---
How much do you want for it.
---
So no endgame build allowed at all is what I'm hearing? All endgame builds do more than enough damage to make this happen. 
---
Look, I know it isn't what "makes sense" but it's the same mechanic they've used in a number of other ways in the game. It is "as intended" just needs adjustments to balancing to make it "fair" but also functioning. 
---
Not really on failure points.  This is solid idea.  All that needs to happen is both sides have to confirm AND if either side changes what's in the trade box it automatically unchecks the confirmation box for both players.
---
If it needs adjustments then it isn't working as intended 
---
It burns each word after you read it 
---
TSE breaks three times as fast because it shoots double bullets and it's explosive. I say 3 because the normal wear and tear is also added in there.
---
Tbh if gear rewards cap at lv 50 then cap rewards for PvP should also be capped to level 50 ie 100 caps. 
---
This would be awesome 
---
There's only one setting that works, took me ages to find that out. 
---
Preset to Medium, change field of view, but do not change the sliders for render distance. This gives good performance and keeps VRAM from overloading, but it will not fix the freezes. Bethesda not addressing this issue, tells me its something they can't or will not fix.
---
Yeah, I just bought a Level 40 vampire LMG for my HW guy to be my stimpack. Heals me up in a second or two with that insane fire rate
---
At a guess, I thought they put it into a patch to discourage server hopping. That'd be fine, but it seems there's still a lot of disconnects happening to a quite a few people. 
---
I agree with that it's just me finding it tedious and annoying having to spend 40 caps to go back to mire or cranberry.
---
Nope, because the better version is a drop in game.  Not to mention, repair kit is useless in PVP.  So what Win do you get?
---
Ah nuts...i was ready to grab me some wool
---
You're not understanding what is being said.
---
Either way, simple solution, create a new character for survival only. Easy. 
---
If it's that balanced towards low level players then you should be able to get tons of caps and lvl up quick, right?
---
I like the idea but it should apply to both adventure and survival. It won't matter much though since player will just go through a wall.
---
You problem is you are still playing fallout 76
---
Only 20? There’s more than 20 mods, you need to craft and scrap like 100+ handmade to get them all. 
---
Armor is even worse. I’m at the point with a few armor pieces that I can craft 20-30 armor to learn 1 mod. Sooooo many resources burned. 
---
Thank you 
---
I’ll give you 700 
---
Oh, how I love these "good" times in online gaming... not.
---
I'm playing years online and all of the interactions I had with other players are more or less like the one mentioned above...
---
Only 2 of those were good ones.
---
You have a looong memory! 
---
Is there a reason you needed to carry so much stuff you were over burdened? You blame the game but the issue is likely how you play. You don’t need to haul all that stuff around constantly 
---
Yeah chems have their own, Chemist
---
Use the contractor perk, it cuts down flux costs by half
---
Pretty sure that’s a ranger station.
---
Uv,  because I've been to West Virginia and these people eat up the "Wilderness" Decor like you won't believe. 
---
See that's the problem, let's say I do create a new one... what happens when I level up to much again? Just create another? And another ? And just keep resetting progress forever?
---
No freezes for me at nukes, none. Tons at whitesprings, but no significant load on the system. I'll get it in combat or when stationary browsing the inventory. 
---
Then idk man
---
How did you get that in? Did it glitch out and spawn into the world, or is that some screen in the game files?
---
I'd like to know, too. also, why does food spoil while offline BUT disease timers pause so they run full course? it's intentionally made harder. 
---
The crossbow is great for RP, but not a very good weapon in general. It's stealthy but not nearly as powerful as other silenced weapons. It is super badass to take down a super mutant with though
---
Why? Does it recharge them? I am almost lvl 200 and I have never gotten plans for a prime Gatling laser which uses them, or the prime receiver for an Ultracite gatling laser.
---
Unless there’s a speed difference, which isn’t listed (both are “medium”,) power fist. Modded up they have the same base damage, but the power fist mod adds a small amount more armor piercing. But with 3/3 Incisor, your actual damage difference isn’t going to be all that significant, I wouldn’t sweat it, use whichever has the better legendary effects. 
---
Tried out whitesprings and it was definitely laggier and my CPU had increased usage but I went back to my home which is over toward the eastern side of the map and it calmed down.
---
Yes. Actually I think that's exactly what they intended. That's why they're even creating a new system that rewards you for releveling character post 50 instead of continuing to lvl higher. I think they realize that this is just an issue with the way they handled lvls from day 1
---
&gt;And an endgame player going after Lvl 4s should be incredibly nerfed because that either makes the person a bully or an ass.
---
That's fine, but I've had the same thing happen when I fought a level 178.  I was level 220, but come on.    The distinctions are absolutely meaningless with characters past level 100.  And it wasn't a simple matter of me attacking him for the hell of it.   I was attacking him because he had acquired a hefty wanted level (I assume because he messed up someone's camp).  And what happened to me happened in adventure mode, but I'm pretty sure they said the PVP mechanic had been changed for both modes. 
---
It's annoying, for sure. And one reason I'm always poor af in this game. Lol
---
Should I delete
---
Thanks for your input, on the fallout 76 sub.
---
Gear caps at 45-50(depends on the gear)
---
the scorched beast parts are really just for cooking, they give you different benefits and you can make food that takes each individual piece.
---
 For better gear, places like watoga, white springs(haven't ran that in so long personally) WestTek, uranium fever, any horde event will give you legendaries to farm for better gear.
---
As for what there is to do, that comes down to the individual, you can start a shop, grind out legendaries, or what I do, pvp, I became a raider on survival mode and it's kept me enjoying the game more than I did prior to that. Endless fun if you know how the pvp I'm the game works.
---
Yes they are! Pistols have mobility and crazy vats crits. Your just not using them right. Try dropping concentrated fire and using modern Renegade and Crackshot. Thank me later
---
I went from 50 to 80 by hanging out at white springs looking for a couple legendary items worth a damn. I’m still looking 🤪.
---
Survival mode was kinda fun, but I don’t like seeing my supplies and my money dwindle from one shot tanking level 40’s.
---
Honestly, there’s nothing left. I have no idea how people make it to level 100.
---
I have, just had to do it very lowkey. Have to have it out in the middle of nowhere and hope for the best
---
So one block base building does work in the real world. Thanks for sharing the pic!
---
Neither
---
I had this same glitch. When you first log on immediately drink. Then as soon as it says to land a sneak attack do it. It has to be all done immediately upon log in. I was told this after trying everything suggested for a week before this worked.
---
Max’d out level 50 versions show the same damage on a third claw DCG vs a puncturing PF, but the armor piercing on the PF should put it slightly ahead. 
---
Oh fuck yes! Heading there now.. thank you so much - this made my day!
---
Its more playable now, took me quite a bit of digging but I found [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b05q1g/any_solution_to_my_problem_fps_drops_stuttering/eicg9l8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and it helped me quite a bit.
---
Well theres the UVDA thats the only political party that meets the criteria
---
If it's a prestige system then that is different but we are talking about what is in game right now. It's broken as of now unless you are lvl 30ish
---
I've never seen one. Seems weird there's not a serrated/dual blade for it. It's a sweet weapon but basically unusable except for RP. What are your legendaries? I've never even seen one drop
---
If you find the model/textures to an enemy or item you can edit the files and swap them with a currently existing creature/item to see what it looks like, this is how we were able to see the 4 leaked power armor skins
---
oooh ooh! 
---
also allow all energy related damage mods with the armourer to use the fusion cores supply with useage of fusion core anti drain cards 
---
Performance is fine. If that is what you want, then go ahead. Hell you can even use the controller.
---
It wasn't that much stuff. I constantly struggled to figure out what it was without consulting the Internet. I carried all my clothing, and like 10 guns. Admittedly, I'm a hoarder but the game is designed to have you constantly haul junk for repairs. 
---
It depends on your hardware.
---
Lone stranger

Lone stoned ranger

---
Why are you here?
---
I just start s new character. This will be my third that I just levelled to 50. I'm hoping that down the line DLC makes all my unique characters fun to play again.
---
You can definitely tell a bigdifference on ultra settings. Obviously things are always gonna look better on a beast PC. But I say go for it
---
They look like anal plugs and you "use" them to "enhance" your body.
---
What did you think where they go ?
---
If he killed you you hit back 
---
What issue?
---
Online games work like that. 
---
My camp is highly visible and gets leveled Everytime I go on survival, yes I rarely end up in PVP. LoL
---
It probably dropped on a random encounter. The worst I ever saw was two Col Gutsy's, but that was in the Bog
---
Yes.
---
The less you carry the less you lose. Sorry this modes too hardcore for you chris kyle
---
Just tried on both my characters, except both had their secondaries weapons empty. 
---
I hear you on the Mayor.  I just want to unplug him.
---
Guns are heavy, you don’t really need to travel around with more than 5 or 6 that you use regularly. Also clothes add up in weight. You gotta utilize the stash more effectively. If you are still having problems, sell some shit you hoarder!
---
For yellowcake, fluorescent, crimson and cobalt flux you need to head to a nuke zone at whitesprings, radberrys for yellowcake, nuked rhododendrons for fluorescent, nuked glowing resin on the trees and nuked silt bean plants for cobalt, and nuked aster flowers round the hotel entrance for crimson, and don’t forget to equip the green thumb perk or use an extra flora magazine  
---
The mode was broken before launch because of duped weapons and gear.   I guess there's no way to please everyone, but for those of us who don't want PVP to be a complete shit show that it currently is, I wish they would have a mode with no legendary gear and no mutations.  Not everyone wants to play that way I get it. But not everyone wants to play in a world where success is largely dictated by RNG- where every other player has TSE and leaping around like kangaroos.
---
That seems to be the direction they're going with it. 
---
Currently uncapped lvls is too hard for them to manage and balance it seems
---
No they didnt, but we know what causes the bug now.  When you place your green c.a.m.p. do not move it again, let the green box lie where its set.  The bug is if that moves it misaligns your camp.  Ever since I stopped moving it, my camps have been safe.
---
I've found artillery useless. It always seems to say I'm out of range or too close.
---
Did the game tell you if someone took your loot bag at one point, or did I imagine that?
---
Need something 
---
I want to tame one. Please let me take it. 
---
The fact that you are still referencing TSE tells my your info is outdated. The meta is still explosove but TSE is garbage now compared too other explosive weapons.
---
A plain level 45 double barrel shotgun gets about 250 damage with seven points of shotgun perks and max Bloody Mess. Bloodied + adrenal reaction + nerd rage gets you over 800. Switch to an unarmed melee weapon and you can stack strength bonuses (unyielding, radicool etc) plus mutations for damage numbers in the thousands.
---
Since two-shot and explosive were nerfed, the really big damage numbers come from stacking low-HP perks and effects. The base numbers aren't everything though. Stealth and VATS crits are also strong.
---
God they should have made all the cultists worship this thing instead of the mothman. 
---
I like furious. Two shot is a beast, but furious ends up doing way more damage on an enemy if sustained, especially if they're armored
---
What difference does your lvl make? All gear is lvl 50 and below and your perks and special are capped at 50. Your level is nothing after that.
---
Pay to win means paying real money for in game benefits. Whether or not the repair kits are literally making someone win or not is irrelevant. Paying for any advantagous mechanic is bad.
---
Thanks for sharing. Now I know what tonight’s nightmare will be. Really, thanks...
---
Ah here we go again with someone telling me that what I have seen with my own eyes countless times never happened. 
---
Yeah, that's super annoying, especially if you're in an area where there aren't any radstags or Brahmin.
---
Oh no smh that’s fine, believe I’m a guy, doesn’t really matter you know? That’s funny though 😂
---
Someone had plague Walker on and gave you a disease while you were around them.
---
Add epicduck00
---
I knew I shouldn’t have made myself dummy thicc 
---
That's literally just a reskinned deathclaw. Look at it... it's a deathclaw in every way but the paint.
---
I know this isn't helpful right now at all whatsoever, but I have several lvl 40/50 pistols you can have. Lvl 50* two shot black powder, lvl50* two shot single action, and one other. I play pistols myself, I'll see what else I have.
---
You mean the uh.. the camp box thingie right? Weird, annoying but thanks good to know
---
The mayor is hands down the best NPC in 76. My camp is right next to Thunder Mountain,  I hear *beep* this is Squire Rosen,  Thunder Mountain is offline.  Repeat Thunder Mountain is offline....  Like 25 times a day 🤣
---
1k
---
Really nice!
---
Did I say it never happened? No. Its nerfed to hell. I said your info was outdated dude. Calm down.
---
It’s more of a joke Challenge 
---
Ehhhh no thanks 
---
I like Sanjay. He sounds like he's tired of all this Responders bullshit, and is just sarcastically faking his enthusiasm.  I don't know if it's deliberate, or if the voice actor just showed up for work tired and hungover and farted his way through the script.
---
If you dont know what issue Im talking about you are lucky u:
---
Basically, I got a popup when I joined a new server telling me my camp could no longer be placed where it was placed, the boyo ninja informed me of a fix hopefully it works 
---
Ah the little read "Harry Potter and the Nuclear Fallout".
---
Everyone, that looks really baaaaaaaad to run into while running low on gear. 
---
Bethesda says the improved repair kits are “rare” in game, meaning you have to spend time looking for them. And the last “rare” items (Fasnacht masks) had such an abysmal drop rate that made people think they didn’t actually exist. But, if you have the money to buy them directly from the atomic shop you never have to stop looting, leveling, grinding, pvping. You are paying for an in game advantage with real world money, how is this not pay to win? And please don’t respond with the generic “it’s not actually winning,” you are old enough to be on reddit, you should know by now that p2w doesn’t mean you immediately see a victory banner across your screen.
---
Bashing low level robots with a protest sign was huge fun for me (it was a daily challenge once) now I just want a legendary protest sign lol 😂
---
Some times if you dont see it you have to go into the mission tab and re select it then it will show where it is.
---
Some people are saying this is happening because of a recent patch, and I'm sure they're right because I've only recently started noticing this issue. 
---
And you're right, if the timer on both negative and positive effects are the same, they should both be active when I log back in the next day to play again.
---
I have more disease cures than I even need, I just think some diseases aren't worth using cures on so I let them run their course.
---
Yep happy to. Why waste atoms on a repair kit that is inferior to what you can do in game. I always repair my guns to 200%. The mats are so plentiful it’s virtually free. 
---
lvl 0 Wall Safe in Huntersville just produced a Technical Data... lol
---
Back to the drawing board on safes and their lock level playing a role!
---
Yeah I remember running around Far Harbour in FO4 and I get to a town on the south east of the island, and as I check VATS to see if anything was around the car to the left of me just stands up, takes a swipe at me and then spawns it's hatchlings. Almost never been so scared in my life
---
Someone near by used Berry Mentats, it’s been having that effect for a while but I’m sure it will get fixed at some point.
---
Buy those repair kits from the atom store when they come out. 
---
Higher level players lose much more caps since you lose double your level. That's the balance.
---
5 or 6 is still a bit much for guns in my opinion. 2 does me just fine.
---
It's useful for tracking hours played. Though yeah, I honestly think it should be like 4000 atoms or something wacky. 
---
You only get packs every five levels. Not every level. So if you didn't get one at level 20, that's a problem. If you didn't get one when you hit 23, that's the game working as intended. 
---
U need a 25k weapon and each armor piece should be 25k each..hence 150k while in the wastelNd..anything less is unacceptable
---
Make rifles and scrap to learn mods.  
---
It creates a full charge ultracite core which power armor treats just like any other core.
---
It does cost pure flux to craft though ;)
---
already got one this morning but am looking for one for my wife will pay 3000 if your interested
---
Yes, thanks for stating all the obvious. All I ever did was sell shit (3 things at a time because of the idiotic bot cap limits). My stash was full of junk. The only things I enjoyed about the game were collecting outfits and admiring the landscape so being overburdened helped with the latter. 10 was a rough estimate and might have been 5 or 6. It's been months. They need to start putting out official instruction guides that list everything and warn you not to join up with randos so they can launch nukes while you're struggling to get back to the silo after being killed inside. Oops, nope. You didn't make it and all your shit is stuck inside because the silo is on lockdown. Kewl. There were many things I disliked about this game. 
---
But, the atomic shop kits mean you get to loot, level, grind, or pvp without stopping to worry about farming up junk to repair weapons.
---
Damn, I'm trying to get rifle man perks
---
Not on right now but I think it's limb damage, 40% swing speed and +1 strength. Was hoping to find something like the machete mod that adds bleed and poisoning and looks awesome
---
I can't agree more.
---
I'm level 121 seeing others at 200 and up going wow can you imagine grinding for another 100 levels. I didn't get any PA (excavator 45) until I was level 50 something. I'm currently looking for plans for other PA. There are places I haven't discovered yet so I'm just taking it easy and grinding..
---
Its so annoying i spec'd out of rifle on my SBQ killing character and stick strictly to meleeing the adds because I got sick of changing from my super sledge to my bare hands 
---
That'ed make it a much more viable set of armor, for sure. 
---
If you die like fully die without respawning there will not be a loot bag..for example..I once fell through the cracks at a fissure site and the bag was gone forever which was so frustrating because I just found a bag with 200 fiber optics..I just got mad again thinking about it
---
If you're on ps4, I can do all the mods if you just cover the mats. No other charge besides that. 
---
Sam and Dean killed them all.
---
“Everyone use A TSE” is such a shit argument, they are so bad, they have crap accuracy and durability and you don’t know what you died by unless the person who kills you tells you 
---
Ah, that makes sense. So you reskinned a deathclaw into this?
---
A recyle bin for junk that others can pick through would be cool. Like suitcases at stations.
---
The vendor bot in Grafton has lever action plans, just make guns to scrap and learn mods
---
Playing from the start, faced a lot of problems just like everyone who played all that time. For now, game looks good, nice performance, now fps drops, new events, some new items, balance. I have to try it I think, ure gonna like it 
---
Its all RNG based, so the only way you can get explosives is from legendaries and even then they have to be 2-3*. Or you could one via trading
---
It's Bethesda; were you *really* expecting anything else?
---
It's a novelty bottle. Unscrew the head. Quaff. Could be an autoinjector, too. Not everything has to make your browneye blue.
---
There are a few options beyond "someone took it". Maybe it didn't render in (this happens all the fucking time for me, i can sit there for ten minutes and it will randomly pop up in front of me)., or it could be bellow the ground, or...
---
Yeah, the comment you linked has another linked within. That's the one I was referring to.
---
Lots of people bought TSE from glitchers
---
Illusion: 100.
---
Also I have 20K caps and rising. I hear the cap max is 25K so pretty soon I might be in the boat of what to do 😊👍
---
My answer to this is covered already above and you mention it in yours. They drop in loot. So the argument is chicken and egg. Which comes first. So you spend. Or loot and not have to worry about spending. There are far more important things to spend atoms on in the shop. 
---
Sweet lord, I've got to say, I simply don't have the will to do a thorough check on safes, going to update the thread with "A chance to get tech data from all safes"  
---
What? I'm confused, what are you saying? 
---
yea I understand that part, just trying to find the best location for the flux (where the most would be on the map)
---
I mean... one can hope.
---
Illusion/Conjuration: 100.
---
Good looking out.
---
2mm Electromagnetic cartridge is one of the cheapest ammo to make as it only requires steel and lead (5/15)
---
WTH
---
I think this issue is an unintended result of a recent patch. 
---
I don't server hop but when I log off at the end of the night and log in the next day, I want the timers I have on all my effects, both negative and positive, to still be active if they were active when I logged off.
---
You can feel them jiggle inside for twice as long... it is truly an amazing time to be alive
---
This is correct..and ironically..FEs are worth 4 times as much
---
I tried to do my first one alone but during the repair the pipes part a random good samaritan appeared and started mashing robots.  I was pleasantly surprised.
---
*stabbing intensifies*
---
U do this yet
---
If you’re on PS4 I can get you some tonight
---
Happened to me at the scrap yard.. Built it up for hours and was mining black titanium and bam, disconnected.. 
---
Every level you get to choose one card. Every five levels you get 4 random cards, as well as choosing one card. 
---
10mm? I can mod it the way u want it
---
Dayum that's a pretty brutal supply drop
---
I’ve been looking also with no luck. I scrap so many weapons and just keep getting the same mods. My rifle is my fave!
---
Not yet, probably in an hour
---
Sorry you had such a rough time. I’m loving it pretty much constantly. I never get disconnected and the only glitches that really bother me when I’m defending workshops and the attackers spawn underground. 
---
100,000,000,000% agree
---
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
I have a lever to snipe. I want to try out an automatic build to see how fun it is 
---
It’s pay to win no mater how small the advantage is 
---
Aaronholt homestead, top left hand corner 
---
Why would the Jersey Devil be in West Virginia?
---
What'd he say?
---
Are you actually dropping it, or using it and then placing it? Also, I've had several times after using mine where I had to look away and back and it was there. 
---
I think the cost comes from rarity. TSE were duped so much they are everywhere. FE are harder to find.
---
Was it over-repaired and your BOS not? I can over-repair even raider armor over 100.
---
Normally i wouldn't mind doing some awful grind to get a platinum trophy or something, but some atoms...... don't think so.
---
Hmm. 
---
Can't believe there was no interest at all. 
---
He said I'll pay you to assassinate bethesda devs
---
I dont know what you mean
---
Weird. It works for me so I usually just change my weapon and change back because it’s faster
---
If you have one rifleman card you can just pick it next level up, to upgrade it.  Some have not known this.  Of course you will need the other 2 cards also.  
---
I've seen on XB1 spots in corners where you can crouch then walk sideways into to appear inside Valley Galleria workout actually using the doors. Nothing is textured correctly and you can see all the area around you as the walls are invisible. Found it by accident but haven't checked if you can shoot out or how visible you are. Just kinda happened, checked to see if it was repeatable, then went on my way. Didn't even consider survival mode actually. Might be something similar. 
---
Absolutely the reason..I need an AAE lever or handmade but I kno I'll need to shell out 25k caps
---
Every time my workshop gets invaded the game has been saying it’s sheepsquatches for the last few week. I hope to murder them often. 
---
That’s exactly what I said haha I love it 
---
They use more durability than normal weapons 
---
U need the best equipment money can buy
---
I agree with the idea. We should have it on both.
---
You tap the head too hard 
---
Thanks for the cause. I thought it was fast travel because that's when I notice it. 
---
Every Male toon in the wasteland will be walking like https://giphy.com/gifs/season-4-the-simpsons-4x4-l2Jejg3QC43oU8dMI for that CHR bonus
---
That's a particularly obnoxious one that wastes a lot of time. I found out that mostly I enjoyed challenges but then was booted enough during long hikes or prohibited from completing them because the creators clearly didn't bother testing fundamental bits of software they released to thousands of people and realized the company is unethical and can suck a bag of dongs. 
---
The above video shows the same glitch with a player the same level range. Many low level players are seasoned Ayers with new characters. The caps drops between low level and high level players are an incentive for low level players to go after high level 
---
You farm the 2 or 3 star legendary enemies. Look in all the containers around the train station because some people dump free stuff in them. You can buy them from robot vendors. I literally found a TSE handmade in a suitcase.
---
What gun would you recommend in the same class?
---
Same 
---
Great suggestion!
---
Say it again for the people in the back
---
Yes, for $11.95 ^^^each
---
how about a text chat so we can communicate like in most games like this?
---
It's weird how all the new weapons have almost no mods, like they forgot they existed.
---
What do you mean bye that 
---
They didn’t say they drop as loot, they said they would be part of SBQ loot and when you take on in game content. None of that suggests that when farming behemoths or mega sloths that I should expect a repair kit. And they said they would be “rare.” Do we really need to look back to Fasnacht masks to see what Bethesda consider an acceptable drop rate for rare items. They have confirmed that you can pay rwm for immediate access to a 100% repair kit, how is this not p2w?
---
You clearly hate this game and don’t play anymore why are you even on here?
---
Why AAE over other options?
---
Yeah. Not sure why that can't be done. 
---
7600?, ;)
---
I heard nothing but great things? I'm not a bloodied build otherwise I'd look for that as well I have 2 TSEs already 
---
They can't sell something unless they sell it. Of course items will come back, there's money to be made.
---
If you're dropping it instead of placing it you almost deserve this fate. 
---
I'm getting pretty solid performance on my standard PS4. Rarely get the fps drops, the game is wonky when loading in for the first 30 seconds but it's not always that way. They really, really improved server performance and I almost never get disconnected.
---
I've got a two shot, faster fire rate western you can have. Psn is murdomcsalt
---
U can go on the market subs and ask someone to put the scope on for u for caps
---
ESO just hit 5 years. If you play the average 8 hours a day you would be there in half that
---
They'll come back as vintage items or in sets I'm sure. Probably at full price or 20% off. There's no reason for them to take items out other than superficial scarcity, so I'm sure they will rerelease them
---
I sorta thought he would be like ' ^_^ omg its sheepsquatch &lt;3' but this is more ' OMFG ITS FUCKING SHEEPSQUATCH, HIDE YO KIDS, HIDE YO WIFE!!!1!!!!'
---
If you don't mind me being 24 ((in game and in life! XD)), I'm playing a lot of 76 on Xbox at the moment.

Wait.... is there another way to get into it?

Juicehead had this picture in his latest video. The creature itself looks like some pure nightmare fuel
---
Missing the poitn completely. Also can out do that with rifles. 
---
Hmm at level 200+, I think i have it, but thanks ;) 
---
You have to learn the mods for each weapon you scrap. They're weapon specific. You only learn lever action mods by scrapping lever actions. 
---
I saw what u posted originally learn how to read u douche
---
If it's a legitimate Vault door, like the big gear, that's new. 
---
It had the door that couldn't be opened, but there was nothing but mountain texture behind it.
---
For me that is still loot as I do any event I can get my hands on. It’s pretty simple. You see it as p2w. I don’t. You won’t be able to change my mind. Save the effort for someone else. 
---
They said the server performance was up 300% but after the last hotfix I swear it's back to how it was months ago. Very unstable in the last week. But the game is great. You just need to have patience. 
---
Hey sweet, now I can tell u to go fuck yerself and learn how to read threads because someone answered already moron. But thanks for that awesome sidebar! 
---
You *can* on PS4.
---
So, what a deathclaw would be if it were a mammal instead of a reptile? 
---
Level 200 asking noob questions.,learn how to play u nerd
---
they should also fix the wrapped cap to work with the gas mask like it did in 4, just saying
---
As silly as paying a monthly Internet service fee to a console manufacturer, when you already bought the console and already pay someone else for Internet access.
---
Lol like nerd is an insult, considering we FUCKING Rule this world u all enjoy, dumbass
---
10 guns? I mean a carry weight of 220 is fine, that allows 4 guns heavy armour and a loads of loot, Chems, food etc. Nobody needs 10 guns haha. By the way, I discovered at around level 25 that around 1/4 of my weight was gunpowder which i never realised was not in the junk pile! Could have been your problem.
---
I think it would be hilarious if I could get a drill hand and still hold another weapon in the other. I wanna be a big daddy from bioshock
---
They should fly you out to Bethesda and have you pick any staff member to provide you with sexual favors. 
---
i dont have a mic, but ill gladly play. have a level 83 and 19 right now. add me whenever: lnvictivus (first I is a lowercase L)
---
Sure , I’ve just come off Xbox for the night but I’m a medic always happy to help. GT: KnowledgeHound 
---
Lmao admitting he's a nerd..have a good day..u have been reported 
---
Lmfao 
---
Where can I find one 
---
This made me think of Garbad the Weak from the original Diablo. Watch, this dude will drop some crap loot, then shout, "thiiiiiis too gooood for you! Must kiiiiiill you!"
---
https://youtu.be/saHaGl2D_JI
---
Check out the video, tells you where to nuke for specific fluxes.
---
Suck my dick 
---
Lucky you, I’ve had 3 disconnects this weekend and it’s hung 3 times. Even so, that still doesn’t stop me playing, I like it.
---
How often do your guns break in the middle of a fire fight? personally I've only had it happen a handful of times, and you know what i do? I switch to my backup gun.
---
In all reality, if you have to use a repair kit during a fight you're screwed anyway. It doesn't sound like you can hot key it, you have to select the weapon from your pipboy, inspect it and then hit a button to repair it.
---
Good heavens yes! So many times I have tried to communicate with someone (not everyone has a mic @bethesda) even those that have mics (like me) cant always use them because of kids playing dogs barking and gunshots in the background.
---
Lol ur feelings hurt I win 
---
I'm level 56 and haven't completed a lot of the quest lines. That's what I plan to do.
---
I plan to collect different types of PA, which takes a lot of resource gathering. I'm working on finding my ideal armor as well.
---
Also, I just rebuilt my camp and am working on trying to wire it with conduits for a clean look (although I am pretty close to top budget, so we'll see).
---
Nope because I started itching all the ammo to that was not for any guns I carried. I think my Max carry weight was like 1100 lb or something. Tempted to fire it up and see what it currently is but that requires an update that I don't feel like doing and I'm actually not sure I didn't delete game.
---
To ruin lives.
---
Worthless. Except when a clown masked fool tries to hit me in adventure mode. I just turn and vomit on them !
---
If you have a powerful PC then why the hell did you buy it on Xbox to begin with? 
---
This is the "due to an update it can no longer be placed" right?
---
I like building near stuff and I've been getting so agitated thinking there were bigger imaginary borders than there should be.
---
My in game name is Wombwithaview69 (yes it's stupid but I can't change it)
---
god this is so terrible. i cant fix it and i cant play like this.
---
what a waste
---
So...it’s just a deathclaw?
---
It can take time for it to show up when first loading in. It’s taken mine a good minute before it showed up after placing it.
---
Also are you using it to place it or actually pressing the drop from inventory button?
---
I think i just sheeped my pants 
---
I'm on late night and have a lvl 123 but I need to power level my lvl 10. Hit me up GT: PaPaLuvU... I have steel and a little aluminum lol
---
I question whether they're dupers at that price, but i do see 75c to 125c a lot on Looking for Group pages. 
---
Not ammo dude, gunpowder. In the misc menu. Weighs a lot!
---
I was in RobCo yesterday and a 3* super mutant master was glitched inside an inaccessible room, along with 2-3 other super mutants. I was able to kill them all but only the ones who weren’t legendary had body parts sticking out of the wall, like some sort of freak teleportation accident. Feelsbadman.jpg
---
Are they finally making pacifist mode to where if you have it on then there can be no pvp including your base?
---
Are you expecting someone to say "no, I don't think this game should have any content past level 50?" Of course this game needs more content, it's got like 1/5th the content of any other fallout game, it's a big empty world with a bare minimum of quests and story. Everyone on earth thinks this game needs to   
---
1) be less glitchy  
---
2) have content. 
---
Buy the plans from a vendor and make them yourself.
---
I know Grafton train station has the plans.
---
I like it. 
---
The shear terror of it.
---
You shoulda seen em before the bombs dropped, YIKES!
---
&gt;“Everyone use A TSE” is such a shit argument
---
Of course, especially when I see TSE everywhere in survival making short work of people and countless players here on reddit are still trying to acquire one for PVP.  And  I see it in action daily because it's my team mate's weapon of choice and he routinely slaughters players with it but yeah it's a shit weapon.  Of course. 
---
I pointed this out to friends early this week. Even if you left the game on non-stop since launch, you still wouldn't even be half way there.
---
I've wondered why all weapons don't have around the same amount of mods.  Then you have ranged weapons that have an unnecessary amount of indistinguishable barrels and other parts. We should be able to customise every weapon to do specific things and be good at something specific. 
---
...I'll take cash. 
---
Honestly, I don't use purifiers or turrets, I don't need to, so I only need to power lights. At 12 power the windmill more than covers me. I always try to live in spots that seldom see enemies, but if any do come, they go for the squeaky generator first. The wind gens are super cheap to fix.
---
Also, the aesthetics and sound files are pleasing to me. Whereas the fusion generator is ugly and I don't like the sound, neither do enemies it seems to me. After 1200 hrs in the game I find the FG is more attractive to mobs. That's just me though, not downing anyone else's preference.
---
Oh woe is me, people are picking up on my puns
---
750 and collect tomorrow (around this time)?
---
Wow, honestly didn’t expect you to straight up admit your are just not interested in trying to save the game. Also, please explain why you don’t see this as p2w. You are trading real money for an in game buff/boost. Would it be different if you could pay $1.99 when repairing any weapon to put it at 300%?
---
Yes I know. 
---
It's in the kitchen and keeps my beer cold 😁
---
Wow I literally just put the game down for the same reason. Everything the same. I’m playing on an Xbox One X. I entered that building 5 times now. Even after a restart it crashed. Before it crashed the first time I was in the building and everything was fine. 
---
It's really there as a timer for how long you've played, especially since unlike Steam, Bethesda's launcher doesn't have anything like that.
---
Or you can give me yours.
---
Really... I will login and try it. I have a lot of flux. I need to get more violet flux, but the others I have in ready supply.
---
I'm guessing future content.
---
You do get one for completing the story though, it has 5% VATS hit chance or something. Pretty meh
---
I have the plan what do I do now 
---
Unpopular opinion: I love the Grafton mayor. 
---
It's actually like this on adventure mode right now for Xbox as well. About 5-10 secs for farma pharm and just super choppy fps.
---
Farm screws
---
Same. I was able to enter the first time and was waiting for a friend to continue the quest. But he started having the same problem so we quit for the day expecting it to sort itself out the next day. But now it's happening to both of us.
---
This sounds enticing
---
After tonight I won't be on until next weekend
---
GT is same name as here. I'm on now and always looking for more people to play. If level matters, its 71 that'd easily drop my original lvl 180 something character 
---
These are random buildings across the map. I open the map to see where these 2 to 4 hour longest life players are. I go to them. I see there are other players trying to find that #1 player who has lasted for 4 hours. As soon as the other player starts leaving the area, the #1 player magically runs through a wall and starts shooting from behind. I start shooting him then he runs back into a building with no possible entrances. I inspect the building by moving closer to it. That's when I see a body part sticking out a wall. There were a time I died from a Gatling Laser gun that was halfway sticking out from a brick wall on the side of a salon shop. The player clearly knew what he was doing.
---
&gt; Also if you dont want PvP then just play adventure mode.
---
Why that is sooo profound. And original. Nobody's ever  said that on here before.  Did you come up with that on your own? 
---
How dare you
---
I end up doing the opposite when it's a younger kid, teenagers can play it so long as they aren't assholes for all I care, but small children shouldn't be on and I'm not censoring myself in a mature rated game just because a child is around and can hear me, so I end up just telling them to gtfo because their parents aren't doing a good job, I've met 5 year olds playing this game and they couldn't even grasp the concept of having hunger and thirst meters to keep from dying.
---
Do you want people just afk on servers with moving left-right macro? Because that is what will happen if there was big reward
---
Been a few patches.  Only big thing imo is the survival mode for harsher  PvP experience. Can be fun but still needs tweaking when spawning.
---
New quest and a legendary vendor bot coming out very soon to spice things up
---
Yes, please.  It's fine if it's not for a while, as I get on to play very sporadically.
---
Oh, interesting.  I thought it was how much *I* was doing.  Well, that's misleading then, but it makes sense.  I know the Ripper/Buzz Blades hit several times a second, but it didn't seem like it should have added up to that much.  And indeed, when I use the Ripper against other things, it takes them a while to go down.
---
The Buzz Blade though, hard to say.  That thing was a touch-of-death against pretty much everything when it was over-repaired that one time.  But I could never get it back to that point.
---
Judging from the animation files it seems like it's going to have unique attacks including kicks and an aoe attack of some sort, so it may move differently as well.
---
It might be like gulpers in a way, they are reskins of deathclaws as well but you likely wouldn't have noticed unless you looked at them really closely.
---
Capture workshops and do events. You get awarded lots of them.
---
Would've been cool if it was something insane like 10k atom points or something.
---
So cows turn into two-headed Brahmin, and sheep turn into... this?
---
my normal lever action rifle breaks way quicker than my tse shotty. my guess is that its a bug with the gun since it feels like the condition degrades from 100 to 0 in about 45 minutes
---
On Xbox you can search "recent players" and find people you've bumped into recently. If they're showing online, you can piggyback into that server through them. It's a little bit of a long shot most times, but during queen fight, you're bound to be able to come back through someone still there.
---
To be clear, this is only a suggestion to get around a serious ~~bug~~ oversight that's been ignored FAR too long. I'm not at all ok with the devs failing to implement a "rubber banding" feature, as they have in place to re-enter a team, to keep a player from losing their place in events or workshops the player is involved in.
---
Giving you an upvote for not stealing his loot and doing an obnoxious emote over his corpse.
---
You're showing as not online. Can't join.
---
Wait... your angry that I said if you dont want PvP then play the game mode that gives you that option? Wtf? 
---
Couldn't find a match with that gamertag
---
Would be cool if there was a 10 level range in which u can pvp with
---
I would love this, hanging out at camps is fun even when not crafting
---
Vats headshots and criticals. Sentinel and cavalier can't block vats crit shots.
---
Yeah I just read that. I don’t really care for PvP, and the 25% XP bonus doesn’t sound that alluring to me TBH
---
I’m level 25 and I’ll play with you. My gamertag is Quackhorse71678, and I’m active mainly on weekends and 4:00-5:00 PM most weekdays
---
Lol! To be fair it is to be expected in that mode. Don’t get me wrong, when in adventure mode I love helping ppl out and what not. But in survival mode I’m all Raider. I shoot, claw, blow up anything that moves. Cause I know it’s s shoot first world.
---
Try now, sorry
---
Been having that problem all day. Sold a few things and had to keep logging on and off. Let me try joining your game
---
That post pissed me off. I just decided not to comment because I didn't want to be negative, but I couldn't help but think it read like someone coming up with a story to earn sympathy for something that is literally a feature in the game. If they did any amount of research beforehand they'd know people can destroy camps, maybe don't let your developmentally disabled child play something *designed* to have conflict and drama. I only say "drama" because I remember that coming from Todd Howard or Pete Hines when they said they wanted that element to be part the game. Personally I hate people being able to destroy my camp, and I'm looking forward to the pacifist camp update, but none of that changes the current state of the game, or their responsibility as a parent in that situation.
---
I have a 3* lever action which is an absolute beast which takes forever before needing to be repaired
---
Lol ammo plant fun.  Couple weeks ago disconnected after seizing it fighting off defense quest of mole rats. Settle in and wipe.  Next server took hold within seconds of capture TWO scorchbeasts defense quest!   Whittled then down with defense repairs and running out to distract them from attacking. Then a 207 (I’m 100). Who obviously sees the two scorchbeasts initiates a hostile takeover. At which point I didn’t care just let me kill this last scorchbeasts. He stops. Instead of helping. Kills me.  I came back he went back to taking it and I killed the last scorchbeast which was just before he took it. So at least reward and looted corpses. I left and hunted scorchbeasts to the north of there at that rift for awhile.  
---
Smart.
---
Great ideas. Would happily trade some if the bonus carry capacity for weapons like that
---
No I don’t care for the XP myself either. I still mainly treat that mode as one giant multiplayer arena which can be fun for a bit here and there. But that’s it really. Just a nice way to test out your weapons freely against harder enemies lol 
---
Omw
---
Oui
---
I wish I could super upvote this!
---
Has anyone else gotten notifications that their workshops are being attacked by sheepsquatch just to get there and have it be something else? It happened to me a few times and I raced back because I thought I’d get to see this guy 😂
---
I found them no, but can't currently get in.
---
Hmm?
---
Did you own a workshop. If so his friend initiated taking it and he killed you. He simply saw who owned the turrets and then found you on the map.
---
I WANT HIS HEAD AS A TROPHY!
---
Really?
---
*springs 
---
What she drop for y'all 
---
Bloodied automatic railway rifle 👀
---
This roughly tracks with my findings Dragoneer, and I'm luck 11,  at this point I don't believe Luck has a weighting in the loot drop, if anyone wants to test I'd be delighted to be wrong and will update accordingly. 
---
I have the same impression of the Mr. Farmhands in Flatwoods.  "You need to reboot the server... again."  Okay, at what point do we just shut them down completely?  They clearly don't do anything but malfunction and start killing things every hour on the hour.
---
Jokes aside, I hope they eventually add a "time played" statistic on the launcher. 
---
Better yet, add an in game terminal for your camp that keeps track of your stats! 
---
- Time Played
---
- Scorched Killed 
---
- Nuka Colas Drank
---
- Caps Acquired/Spent 
---
- Shots Fired
---
- Nukes Launched 
---
- Times Spent Listening to Take Me Home, Country Roads
---
I'd love to just sit there and go over stats and random stuff. 
---
Oh yeah. StabbyStabbyStabby.
---
There needs to be emotes for if you mic isn't working or have it off. Also "hold up"
---
But for that level 45 shotgun, what’s the damage listed in the weapon specs? I’m still unclear if a level 5 double barrel shotgun has the same *listed* damage as the level 45 version. 
---
So far from what I have seen, base damage does NOT increase with weapon level, which makes me wonder why weapons are level limited at all... but that could be just the luck of what I have found I guess. 
---
(Regardless it’s clear that perks are critical and I don’t yet have any that boost damage on weapons I care about. The stock 2x stealth boost is all I have right now.)
---
Stash increases, u can see what you've already learned for recipes and plans, moving camp is less of a PITA
---
Strong likes!
---
On the trailer video you can see a power armor helmet sitting there amongst the weapons. Cool.
---
It's gonna look scary when it freezes in position and doesn't drop any loot
---
this sub sure did forget about their hatred for the repair kits quickly...
---
Your imgur link is working for me. 
---
Just use the gun in 3rd person - little dot stays in the middle of your screen.
---
If you hit the button to drop the frame (like the same way you'd discard unwanted junk) it will *normally* spawn it in front of you, but it's just like dropping items the game no longer treats it like yours (I think). The way you're supposed to do it is actually activate the frame same way you would use a Chem and then it will show an outline of it that you can then place in the world. 
---
And today I finally found and bought a X-01 Calibrated Shock. I genuinely laughed out loud. 
---
Just keep grinding for the time being. Your only real good chance.  Until the legendary vendor bot comes then maybe you can get tokens for one
---
Honestly? I doubt many people would bother. You're spending a shitload more in power over that span of time than you'd get back in atoms. 
---
Yeah I think  I get that. I just wish there was PVP with a purpose.   Just stabbing a random stranger to death feels dirty.    Teaming up with fellow Brotherhood soldiers to take a power plant from someone is a more worthy cause,  because I'm doing the Brotherhood's  duty to make sure dangerous tech doesn't fall into the wrong hands. 
---
Same with not letting anyone else have the ammo factory. 
---
I guess what I'm saying is I'd like PVP to be faction based. Choose a faction upon entering into your world, with all other players in your factions marked  as friendly and unkillable, with all else being fair game. Something like that.
---
This would be awesome but I think the lore buts would have a shit fit. 
---
4months of 1400 caps per day per character
---
Nowadays many people use the Civil War top hat plan to turn cloth into 30+ caps each. It’s not new but it has only been common knowledge for a few weeks.
---
Where can I farm screws 
---
Great idea. Lvl 102. Profshade2
---
Nobody knows. Answers to this question are going to all be pure speculation.
---
Desk fans, globes, and toys.
---
Do tell...
---
Be careful what you wish for.  Such a request is destined to become the next "Legendary" Drill. 😋
---
Wow. How sad it is for you to search back through a person's history to make such a point. I really do pity you.
---
However, to respond to your question, as knowingly obnoxious as it is to quote myself, I think it speaks volumes to my current perspective:
---
&gt; When there's a real issue, I'm with you but until then, let's not cry wolf. 
---
When we get to decorate our camps, does that mean we can put bobblehead up now?
---
I'm of two minds with the Mr. Farmhands.  On the one hand it would be easier to just shut them down but on the other hand they maintain the crops outside the center so we have a constant supply of tarberries.  I think the Grafton Mayor is a much clearer choice, just shut him down and smash the hardware.
---
I'm adding all of you. If you see  Inbredpoet around the wasteland give me a wave or a shout.
---
It's about damn time. Maybe this will make PA less of a joke in PVP. 
---
No, screws. You need more screws then springs.
---
Check Wallace in harpers, the vendor bot in watoga shopping plaza, and sometimes the enclave vendors will sell the mod cheap 
---
That’s what I gathered.  Thanks for the post. 
---
There is no farming for explosive weapons. I've played for over 300 hours and never got one from a drop. Then I found one for sale at the Watoga station.
---
Not saying this is you but some people also blame the servers when it is their own internet connection which is the problem. I recently upgraded my internet to a faster speed and since then I have only experienced a disconnect once in the past month. 
---
It's for knuckles
---
I found a Bloodied Gatling Gun yesterday that makes a pretty satisfying sound.
---
I like stabby Combat Knives.
---
But I think my favorite weapon is the Mole Miner Gauntlet.  It's comically oversized, looks badass, and does a lot of damage.
---
Ok cool I’ll invite you 
---
It's be great to be able to team up for quests and not be hostile, and then after the loot is divided there be a timer before all hell breaks loose
---
Why not put up something of value as collateral and I'm sure you'll have a line of people show up. A meta legendary weapon. 10k caps. 
---
It just like in the advertising posters for the armor. Instead of yellow in the posters its navy blue
---
Ok then what 
---
I use motion-assisted servos -- increases strength by 2, and thus melee weapon damage.
---
That would be faction pvp. It would benefit a Rpg Game like Fallout more than a Deathmatch Server.
---
Are people mad at you about the shotgun
---
That's actually a good idea and meaning for it.
---
Fictionally or literally?  Fictionally, I can understand that the Farmhands maintain the crops around the building.  Literally, I'm pretty sure they grow without their help. 😊
---
I run bloodied build and my bloodied tesla rifle does like 650, works great for clearing hordes, even muties. 
---
My laser rifle does around 250 but with beam splitter that hits 4 times so it's about a thousand. This thing breaks fast as fuck though, can probably get 50 shots out of it from 200% with gunsmith 5.
---
On a different character I have a Bloodied Gatling Laser with a prime reciever that does 230 per hit, it hits about... 5 times a second maybe? I dunno. 
---
Still looking for a bloodied plasma, I want to try the flamer mods. 
---
Maybe that’s the estimated time they have until the next fallout game. 4ish years? Maybe? 
---
I mean nah, this is an actual cryptid reported to exist in real life West Virginia. Dunno if that’ll be the explanation in-game
---
For real, NEVER power more then one plant.  Every time I've gotten 2-3 up, the whole server crashes!!!  Also, if you're playing on Xbox (dunno if ps has this feature), you can hit the big X button, go overhp
---
Or you could just play an actual game instead of this excuse 
---
Craft rifle. Then scrap rifle.
---
So pretty much everything that was in previous Fallout games?
---
I found the trader at camdim park sold a lot of mod plans for the excavator 
---
Since the kids can buy prepaid cards these days its hard to control what they are playing especially on pc.
---
Shit, was that in Fallout 3 and 4? I must have completely missed that or just forgot... 
---
Someone probably is, they made a comment about me "going back on my word" just cause I said it was gonna end at 7 my time, and you happened to come in with exactly what I have been looking for lol. So no shit I'm gonna go after the rare outfit I've been wanting to trade
---
People have made their own lists, but IMO none are complete and things change with every patch.
---
Here are some player-made lists:
---

---
You have to eat those too to gain their power.
---
Funny part is they didn't even make an offer lol
---
That's what I mean. And from a lore perspective  I think it makes more sense then just a bunch of players hopping around though the air and swinging death claw gauntlets for no particular reason. 
---
It happens its cool tho dont let it get to you
---
Man, that would be sweet.
---
Supposedly, as part of a future update where you can decorate your CAMP with things from your Stash.
---
Functionally of course.  The lore and their name suggests that they were built and programmed to maintain the crops.  They could grow without them but they grow better with them.  They just have a huge programming bug.
---
Pretty sure you can access your stats from you pip-boy, you 100% could in 3 but not sure in 4 
---
Yeah doesn’t make much sense why you can’t really.
---
Recon scope doesn't have a lever version and I'm pretty sure it doesn't have a handmade version either
---
That's a large point of this game...
---
Yummy.
---
I play usually late at night est. LiteralGlarg
---
If someone says bidding can end at anytime then obviously it can end at anytime... However if you give a specific time, such as 7pm EST, then you should honor your word. That's just me though I have integrity... Not everyone does though.
---
Huh, I don't remember that. Interesting. I need to go back and replay 3. It's been a while. 
---
People need to be able to see all the legendary effects on a weapon or armor in the trade screen. It just has to happen. Then we need to be able to do item for item trades and some kind of confirmation before trading finishes to ensure they're handled appropriately and people aren't getting screwed.
---
I don't mind which way they go with this just so long as it's consistent. Either all effects follow you or none do.
---
The loot in the aid boxes isn't great, but sometimes the paper bags left by your quarry are wonderful. I picked off a level 7 who came to loot my aid box, and that guy had so many bulk materials I was amazed. I hoofed immediately to Flatwoods and turned a very nice profit.
---
Fantastic! My gratitude is knows no bounds :D
---
Surely, after a little consolidation, we'll be one step closer to understand all there is to know about crafting :3
---
I'd also like a gift emote so we don't have to keep shooting or awkwardly loitering around a paper bag on the ground.
---
I cant upvote this enough!
---
Yeah, you can see how many people &amp; animals you've killed, stuff like that, pretty interesting at the end of your play through 
---
Ya I really don't understand the low payout for that one. You should be given a much greater reward for showing that level of loyalty to a game.
---
Lmfao. It's my sale, my choice, not yours. If someone comes in offering something really fucking good, the bidding can be closed by the seller's choice early, if they want to. I got integrity, you're just bitter about it for some reason. Acting all entitled
---
This is not even close to a deathclaw model.
---
100% parental supervision is key.
---
Lol I have done that so many times and then took there stuff and killed them when they came back and i make so many caps this way
---
Epic
---
You'll never win an argument against someone's sense of entitlement. Boundaries, people.
---
The problem is not the repair kit the problem is Bethesda starting to sell stuff that gives u benefits in game
---
In some time we’ll be getting damage or experience boosts
---
What? Take away the back spikes and the tail and this is just a reskined deathclaw.
---
No thanks 😨

Someone made this quite a long time ago, and it's missing some stuff and has a few discrepancies, so don't take it as gospel, but \*on the whole\* it's a very good resource.
---
It says the Curved blade is learned from scrapping, the Extended blade is not, only from plan.
---
I don't think 100% for everything. But I thinknyou need to judge if your kid is mature enough. I played Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and more as a kid, but I always knew it wasn't something to be scared of.
---
Couple things...
---
For one, don't ever drop. When you drop an item, even a PA frame, that item ceases to be yours. If you get disconnected, it's gone. If someone is walking by and decides to jump into your armor, it's gone. I mean, unless they're nice.
---
Secondly, if you're actually placing the frame by hitting the activate button and choosing where to set it down it could take a bit of time to show. I've had this problem since the last patch, actually, where I place my armor and it doesn't show for like a solid minute. The first time it happened I freaked out.
---
Just be careful. And patient. 
---
LOL yup
---
Very true
---
He is risen! All bow before him.
---
I was scared the whole time some high levels were just gonna bust in there and launch it. See ya noob 😂
---
Don't place it like an auction then just say u want offers
---
Also,  suit up before jumping into the zone
---
Actually wasn’t thinking of that promise they made when I made the post
---
Thx for reminding
---
You needed at least one piece of chameleon to deny them the VATS, but sneaky bloodied is a great build. 
---
Got my first last week..500 hours..and it's a gun I don't use 
---
Good point! I'll start doing that, thank you
---
I see nothing wrong with it. It’s like a buy it now option on eBay. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I mean failure points in terms of coding it, not so much with the checks. I feel like revamping the trade would introduce bugs that would take a few patches to get right. 
---
I hit 1032 this morning 
---
Awesome! First time meeting someone from here.
---
That makes sense, wish they had put Beckley more to the east somewhere. I would have loved to seen them include one of our local towns in game. With Logan so close to Blair Mountain, it would have been a good choice. I hadn't even thought of Matewan, but your right that would of worked perfect too. Maybe even more so considering the strike in game.
---
Now that's what the Wendigo should have looked like 
---
🎵ANGEL OF DEATH, DESIRE🎶
---
So you said wait until they add P2W mechanics. Well, we’re there. You have to either defend that atom shop repair kits aren’t P2W or say they you are fine with Bethesda adding rwm transactions for in game buffs/boosts.
---
It's two lines of codes referencing to Weightless and "Unbreakable" legendary effects for power armor
---
God daaaaamn!
---
Because morality is what is judging the content. As opposed to cigarettes and beer being dangerous physically.
---
Better internet does help, but even those of us with great connections have some patches that are brutal for disconnects. My wife and I have noticed the latest patch has felt sluggish compared to before, but fewer disconnects than a few patches ago (only two disconnects this week).
---
Awesome . And .tasteful. Not tacky. 10/10
---
The worst part about it is just waiting on load screens to go through, and then every time you server hop, that weird 30 second stage where the world's still loading despite the fact you're in the game.
---
It tastes like chocolate*
---
I think it's important to supervise and know what my kids are playing. there are online Minecraft games that are no where near appropriate for kids. but yes an arbitrary game rating or arbitrary age arent what's important to me, it's supervising  them and seeing what they can handle. I stand firm on 100% supervising them but that doesn't mean I stand behind them 100% of the time.
---
Add: franklinmcmahon 
---
Current plan is to find a gattling gun and drop all other weapons off.
---
I continued farming cores and now have over 60 🙈
---
All but cavalier play style is all about a having a minute of non-vatsed invincibility combined with high mobility. My unyielding sneaker is able to stand a shot while sneaking. My cavalier couldn't.
---
I also favor a theory by which more than 3 assassin prefixes are a waste because I believe chameleon and one more to be mandatory for all non-weightless-sentinel builds.
---
I hate loading in and my gun not having ammo needed. 2nd weapon not.loading is a lower issue but still one.
---
Ah well yes that makes sense. I feel ESRB ratings and the like are a good guide. I guess it was different when I was a kid back in the 8-32 bit gaming eras.
---
Depending on the heavy gun you will want all the heavy gun perks in strength, bloody mess and one gun army in luck, and stabilized in intelligence. If your into heavy energy weapons specifically grab power user to double your fusion core ammo and batteries included or if your only interested in ballistic weapons grab bandolier. Bear arms is great if you plan to carry more than one heavy weapon at a time. Adrenaline in agility is great as well since heavies can mow down multiple targets rather quickly.
---
&gt; **If you find the model/textures to an enemy or item you can edit the  files and swap them with a currently existing creature/item to see what  it looks like**, this is how we were able to see the 4 leaked power armor  skins 
---
There is a perk that does this
---
Good run.
---
It’s done! Thanks everyone!
---
Ok? So you could slap this on a radtoad and it would look like this but in the shape of a radtoad? 
---
Hey umm what the fuck 
---
Before the war Bobbleheads were a popular way to smuggle the really good chems
---
1.Stealth boy Mk3 lasts 90 seconds and there's a perk that quadruples the time for stealth boys
---
2. Cavalier gear reduces damage take by 15% per piece worn..... a piece can be assassin and cavalier at the same time so 8% + 15% per piece
---
Yea... I have like 80 of the in my inventory. Lol
---
Yea, another thing that he does is only tell negative parts about games. I almost feel he bought the t-51 helmet and bag just so he could make fun of it and how he BRINGS IT UP EVERY SINGLE TIME HE MAKES A VIDEO. Plus he reported about the "unstoppables" promotion they had where you could get a suit and have 15% more health. He reported that 3 weeks later after it ended.
---
Btw it was very enjoyable. Nothing new as I said, but a well put together video. Checked more on the channel too :)
---
Now you are talking :D. Sign me up for your newsletter!
---
Quick work, great placement, thanks!
---
Damn I just bought 5 for 800 each
---
I am on the final-ish quest...finding nuclear codes and all. Part of the Enclave. But I am solo and level 35, 100 hours so far, and wondering if I am ready. I have build up some good melee and armor but I wonder if I should wait until I am a higher level. 
---
You found a TSE Handmade in a suitcase?!?! What? You lucky MF lol. Wonder who would discard that for free like that 
---
they can be a good guide. I don't always agree with them at all though, it's a case by case basis for each game and each kid for me. I try to inform myself of the game or play it before my kids do.
---
I find it funny that games were pretty gross and graphic when they came out (FINISH HIM!) and our parents didn't seem to care a bit...if only they knew about AOL chat rooms and A/S/L ...
---
That would be nice! No real tactical advantage but power armor is spendy to fix.
---
Let me shoot at things from my bed. 
---
And I raaaam.  I ram so far away.
---
Exciting, I haven't seen any sheepsquatch? events in the map. I am ready for the new stuff :)
---
That would be awesome! Would make for a great longevity setup for sure. So much you can do. Like stop the enclave faction from setting off a nuke on a BOS base all the while everyone is getting swamp with mutants and scorch
---
All i know is that there's a cooldown between mutations you can get, maybe they made it global wise.
---
Lol yeah chat rooms were pretty bad back then, not sure about now but I doubt much has changed.
---
Hate showing up and seeing water or fusion core or lead etc.. when you really need it.. and it's locked..
---
At my CAMP I have free open access to all crafting areas and have a water purifier and some food to anyone.. 
---
I also have my private reserve.. but I don't see the point in being a tight ass for things like that.. also when I did lock it away.. I noticed people just went through the walls until they got it anyway.. not so much now..
---
Bethesda has lost at least 50% of its consumers through their own idiocy, back handed marketing campaign and complete lack luster of a game. When he says the few who are left he's right.
---
Yeah but it sucks :)
---
Did they? I thought I noticed my food spoiling faster. What if it’s cooked? I could have sworn that my cooked items weren’t spoiling, but now I’ve noticed that my ribeye steaks spoil rapidly. I like to keep them handy for the carry weight buff. 
---
Lone Wanderer only has 3 ranks; however, rank 1 costs 2 points so rank 3 costs 4 points. Is this what 
---
You were asking?
---
No one cared but that guy.
---
The laws are in place because of the populations view of what they perceive as moral or not. These laws are in place regarding alcohol or tobacco for different reasons, and the laws are very different in other countries. How would you think it right to punish those whom are responsible for the content their children experience? How would you feel if your government told you that you couldn't play fallout because it is too violent. You would be ok with rolling over like that? Check out if China can purchase Fallout 76 copies from non-black market sources.
---
The law is whatever those in power say it is. And if a Parent or Guardian is ok with their dependent minor playing a violent game, the U.S. government us fine with it. That's why the ToS states that if you are under the age, and your guardian/parent is assuming responsibility, that it's ok. It also says "the age of majority" if it is DIFFERENT than 18 where you live. Which means it is different in different places. 
---
So, nice try you dirty commie.
---
Maaaaan 3rd one today I’ve just missed 😣...guess I’ll pick more flowers. 
---
There is a mod on Nexus that already does this.
---
Maybe a feature that listed the last say, 5 worlds you were in and how long do you can try to figure that out, and then join it.
---
Also maybe tell you what 'zones' are which on them map or something, or somewhere on your screen. 
---
The guy's handle is vinylicpumagaming. I searched a bit and couldn't find the video by some key words but you will hopefully have better luck. 
---
My psn is ryanburns003 thank you I'll take them !
---
It doesnt matter.  Cooked still lasts longer but it goes bad in less than a playing session.  I've switched to alcohol bufftats and garrahan armor for the weight buffs now, meat is uselessly short spoilage times.  When they made the change I first noticed because I suddenly had 37 spoiled meat and no more weight buff foods.  
---
Sweet baby jesus, that is freaky looking! 
---
I'd be fine with them retconning it in a patch later it would be such a good idea!
---
Is it just me or was the Overseer's personal mission really well done? Isn't it a story you heard a bunch of times in So.WV? 
---
Integrity would be keeping your word, which admittedly you didn’t. Expecting someone to hold true to their word is kind of a big deal to some folks. Case in point — the mass amounts of comments here from people upset Bethesda is not holding true to their promise of a cosmetics only cash shop.
---
Look to the right buddy, the subscriber count, then realize reddit's only a portion of the game's community, now go back to bitching about how much you want New Vegas 2.
---
My lever action breaks incredibly fast.
---
Lmao! That’s so sad and awesome! Go get yourself a lottery ticket right now with that kinda luck haha
---
Word. I'll be on at like 9pm EST tonight, I'll add you later.
---
Not for xbox one x.
---
I was the same. I made sure to wait until I was confident I could do it. Over prepared and all. I heard some people have done it solo in the high 30s but I was mid 60s. Just to be sure lol. Also because I wanted to move my SPECIAL points around and get/rank up some perks.  The main thing I used were my stimpacks. Because it was the first time and I went in completely blind, I spent more time running around trying to find the correct path, so I used more stimpacks then I will have to on my next launch. I can't answer if and how it changes based on your level but I did hear it does get harder with a group. I guess you'll have to let me know if you do it at that level haha. Good luck whenever you decide to try!
---
would make the overall experience much more enjoyable
---
Yes use the perk to repair to 200%
---
How have you not been arrested?
---
There’s an exploit where pipboys last forever
---
No. Check the link. Towards the bottom is a roadmap for leveling. So you know what perks to pick out when you have the option. 
---
The map shows at level 4 your specials should be
---
 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 and Lone Wanderer is the perk card. However in game I don’t have LW but have the specials it shows. 
---
So did mess something up or is the roadmap wrong is what I’m asking. 
---
this sub has mods that are keeping that shit under control...
---
Highly recommend it. The elevated mansions are some of my favorite locations in the entire game.
---
Has happened to me twice. 
---
Yessss, how does an online game with an economy based on cosmetic items NOT have more slots???
---
I know the answer is "because FO4" but honestly I think it's in their economic interest to change it eventually... sooner rather than later pleeeease
---
It should, yeah.
---
Thing is, whoever datamined this grabbed the model/textures of a Sheepsquach and slapped it onto a Deathclaw. Of course it's gonna look like a Deathclaw.
---
...feel free to smack me on the head if it turns out Beth shoved a new model onto Deathclaws animations without any changes, though :P
---
Yeah, in total probably spent like 10hours arranging cards lol
---
Why wouldn't they come after him when they are pretty much invincible by the game mechanics?
---
When I got mine I had to server hop. Seems you can only get one every few in game hours otherwise. I used the waste dump by whitesprings that has the rad shower in it.
---
You can in fo4
---
Lucky...
---
Kill them, they are satan's spawn..
---
Definetley. That is the agreed strategy guardian. 
---
Thanks for the response. I am aware that stealth boys can provide this effect. 
---
But it was my understanding that shooting, meleeing, getting attacked (even if you don’t take the damage) breaks these effects. 
---
Assassin + Sentinel/Cavalier drastically reduces damage, yes. But bloodied builds counter that effect, because even if you reduce 90% of 1100 damage, you’re still taking big chunks of damage. 
---
So unless my understanding of these game mechanics is completely borked (which admittedly I do not think is the case), there was some other factor that was at play that I’m unaware of. 
---
This is just a video game, unless you're a sociopath there is no reason to take solace in the fact that eventually a human being with struggles other than your own will die.
---
Fo3, new vegas, fo4 and fo76 all do the same in regards to clothing
---
Its a pain
---
Up the butt, allllll the way up
---
Weird… considering…
---
Haven’t played in 2 months so no idea how it is. Sorry.
---
Did you mean stealthboys?
---
If so, that’s completely fucked and I’ll open a support ticket with the footage I have. 
---
Hi. I sub, I don't play. I like to keep up with the news because I had high hopes, but didn't enjoy the game enough to even keep it installed. That number ain't everything. 
---
Where exactly is this? I can take a look
---
Just repair the base. It’s cheap. 
---
or at least as a start, make perks like lockpicking, hacking, etc, be passive
---
Did mine prolly a month ago..
---
Expected the same thing.. hardest part was the repairing the pipes I thought..
---
Awesome though.. keen on nuke runs now.. haha..
---
Have you thought about just buying the serums? You can get them from 75-100 caps nowadays. 
---
It won't be limb damage and 40% swing speed, just saying 
---
I’m not a hater, so please don’t get my question wrong.
---
I dropped out after really getting into it from the start, bugs and all.  What really took me out of the game (I dropped a really heavy destiny 2 addiction for this), was my like “millionth” time running the nuke plant and owning at least three other workshops and getting dc. I could hang with small bugs and glitches, but the amount of work I was putting in, for minimal returns just got me jaded.  
---
The heart of my question isn’t to shit on the game at all, because I really really enjoyed it.  It’s that, after everything I didn’t even have the chance to hold it down, because I’d get a dc (probably server crash because of the broken plants ‘my theory’) to where I just didn’t want to come back.
---
Basically, for me, it was “why sow a field you can’t reap?”  Killed it for me.  
---
I still love the game, but I won’t come back or touch it until the most fundamental gameplay gets fixed or axed.
---
You can craft the level 25 no frills rifle to scrap
---
So fucking scary
---
Its at Space station when you come from Vault direction it should be on your left,there is like one peace off station and when you go in its there 
---
While that is true, there is alot of kids that doesn't give a flying fuck about their parents' electricity bill. 
---
This question needs answering 
---
After rushing things with a previous character, I currently have a level 51 character. Just finished the second helpings quest last night, then got the Somerset Special (level 45) and Perfect Storm (level 50) this morning. Currently on the Into the Fire quest.
---
Currently my weapons are fully moded perfect storm, assault rifle, auto-pipe rifle, Somerset special and serrated combat knife. I also have a decent level 35 ghoulslayer (30% damage bonus to ghouls) pumpaction shotgun.  I put the typical damage, armor pen, and reload mods, plus short recon scopes on all of the guns, except the shotgun. My perks are focused on 1h melee and auto rifles.
---
I decided to begin the main quest at level 50 to see how good the reward weapons are at their max level. By the time I reached level 50, I'd scrapped everything to learn just about every mod, so was able to further improve the reward weapons. Also, now mobs are dropping level 50 weapons and armor. I figure by the time I get further in the quests, I'll start running into legendaries and get even better drops.
---
For now, I am looking forward to the level 50 Black Diamond. I really enjoyed it at level 15 on a previous character.
---
Alright I'll see what I can find thank you! 
---
Not really sure why workshops dont persist every time you take over that workshop...
---
So the guy who said this is nothing like a deathclaw model is just blind? 
---
1.  I love your descriptions of the clothing.
---
2. Every game needs a clothing system like Saints Row 2.  You could literally dress in layers.  Undies, shirt, jacket, jewelry, the works.  We need something like that.  A slot for every piece of armor and a slot for the same pieces of vanity clothing.  The tech is clearly there, as evidenced by our ability to mix and match our armor pieces.  It's just a pipe dream, but damn it would be so cool to do this.
---
Ah I see what you’re saying.  I’ve only used the roadmap once and I had the same issue with cards not being available when the roadmap said they should be.   Hey don’t know if it was the roadmap or me either but I’d like to know the answer as well!
---
Prove your numbers with verifiable facts.
---
Otherwise your just a liar when you say stuff like that. 
---
More than one time for me my friend.  I really stuck it out for a long time.
---
How many golfers you got?
---
It’s not called a raid because I don’t think it’s going to be like a raid in other games. Fallout can’t handle the kind of stuff like a Destiny raid would require, like different people going to different spots to activate this special thing that allows you to damage the boss. My guess is that it’s just going to be like the mission silos, but even more difficult 
---
Awesome stuff! The hardest part for me was finding my way through. I ran in circles for a good 10minutes at one point. Missed one of the doors for the tunnel after the pipes and was like do I go back wtf haha. It was all a blur really though. I was just excited to be doing it solo and hoping no one came in and ruined it. There were two players waiting outside the silo but when I checked they were only level 40's so I think they wanted to come with. I was well deep in at that point!
---
Woah buddy, youre talking year 2025 betheda stuff right there.😂
---
Also, stuff ages whenever you log out and back in. So if the server drops, you've probably lost a bunch of food too.
---
This is why Tse weapons are so good because they avoid that mechanic due to having multiple damage sources
---
once there is a pinned megathread about it, any topic that gets made about repair kits after is deleted.
---
If they remove the repair kit and all traces of non-cosmetics in the atom shop, I hope they are tameable. I'd tame one and name it Grogar
---
Do the atom shop challenges, trade, take workshops, do events, farm legedaries, explore in great detail, do every quest, change build, launch a nuke, create a new character, role play, help newbies, make a new camp. The list goes on and on and on. The games so huge I don't know how people get bored at level 50
---
I just hope it doesnt reuse mechanics like breaking the mainframe cores and then rebuilding them in the next room
---
I took a long break and just came back too. 
---
The game is so much more polished now. Maybe it’s just in my head, but I seem to be finding more legendary enemies now. Lots of little bugs that were annoying are gone. 
---
While I was away my subconscious was working on my build, so I’m respeccing and then going to launch my first nuke too. 
---
Ah, thanks.
---
also if it's done on console, they don't use hardly any power. neither does a tv, for that matter, but you can also just turn that off.
---
I think the cults may be switching to a trinity model in the near future...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqt8pPT8woI THE OFFICIAL THEME
---
Youtubers are toxic. Just ignore them. Sensationalism  is not news.
---
Right? I just don’t want to wait til 70 or something for a complete build if I can get it done earlier. 
---
Probably a Dev,
---
I found other guns like Two Shot The Dragon, Two Shot Western Revolver, Explosive Shot .44 Magnum, Furious Minigun, and some other guns. I bought a Two Shot Explosive Harpoon Gun from a vendor. The gun sucks, but I still have it in my stash.
---
or you can read what he said better
---
everyone dies eventually, it's literally only a matter of time, and that matter of time is generally 100 years.
---
Enclave experiment 
---
Awesome good luck! I feel the same but funnily enough I've crashed more in the last couple days than ever before. I was fingers crossed it didnt happen during the launch attempt. I got stuck on a terminal at one point and thought oh no here we go but it was just lag lol. I respecced along the way as I kept levelling, it was one of the reasons I waited. Good luck when you undertake the mission and happy nuking!
---
Yeah just looked, there has been, from this calculation, 3456 hours since launch, so yeah, not even half way, also a great day to have done this calculation
---
There are definite crash activation points in this game. I stock up on fusion cores at Poseidon. I took it and have held it many times for an hour or hours. What I tested myself on several occasions is IF YOU make it without crashing through the power up and one defense. If you head to the train station to have a little trip you HAVE to walk to the left of the fence NOT on the road. There is some frame\loading activation point for the area to the East there. Every single time I went that way and headed East into town ON the road even just to pass through to the dam bridge I’d freeze somewhere in between or at beginning. However I have NEVER frozen going to the left of the fence. Up over the road into the grass and down into the train station. Then if I want to go east I headed in the hilly woods overlooking the roads. Once I traveled literally on a huge circuit even up to the fence offed out of play in the north and back around and down. Also, one little trick to watch for instability in the server which I’m sure most players know is how the delay of VATS to hit gets longer and longer. That’s signs of a pending crash   
---
And I do think since they limited the number of items which probably includes players and monsters the game server can handle. It’s best to loot every meat pile you see. Even if you dump or scrap anything there. Those add things the server must now track. I noticed increased stability and less crashes in Poseidon Power Up quest when I began just picking up everything from those bodies and the fly animations and like disappeared. Anecdotal info only of course. But my shots would get faster again. Etc. Xbox BTW
---
My ex?
---
It may have similar requirements, but I doubt it will be the exact same. It will probably be stuff like “kill all enemies to clear the lockdown near the entrance”, “find the two keycards to open the door”, etc 
---
I don’t use it except I have a build for nuke drop sites/high rads - I’m a stealth sniper though, it does seem nice but a pain in the ass to maintain
---
Power armor was never OP
---
?????
---
Yes I’m sorry. I was playing with a guy like 2 weeks ago. He said he did a glitch where he was invisible forever, don’t know much else besides that figured it would get patched fast but you know Bethesda. 
---
I’m also just assuming it’s stealthboys cause he was in power armor 
---
can confirm. I did this with ALL of the Rider armor skins. Also you don't even need to change the texture files. The meshes actually link to the texture sets IN the mesh itself.
---
I said this right from the start when I saw such a huge time played had such a small reward to it, it should be 7600 atoms, since FO4 is my most played game on steam and I only have 1311 hours on that, I'd have to play years and years worth of FO76 to get 7600 hours and at that point we should be rewarded with a fuck ton of atoms, especially when it will only buy us a few skins or repair kits in the atom shop
---
I personally love my 2* junkies explosive gatling gun. I'm not even equipped as a heavy, but it's just so goddamn fun blowing up lines of cars or watching scorched fly. I'd say the lmg is also super satisfying, but it has no mods and is the biggest ammo siphon I've seen since the spray and pray. 
---
Yes
---
I don't have chameleon armor on but I do have a sneak buff on my chest armor. So that might be it. Thanks
---
Ok cool. 
---
I'm going to try it for sure.
---
#MMMmmmmmMMMmmmmmmmm
---
no, it's more like if they say anything, literally anything even if it's unrelated to repair kits, people are going to flood their post bitching about it.
---
it is better to be silent sometimes than a non-commital "yeah we see you" response, because it's essentially the exact same thing.
---
Power armor was never op. I use it cause i love it but most good players font use it
---
Make it like the power plant events where you can fix up a weather station and everyone has the option to see it on their map
---
Thats what i thought lol
---
Wow lol 
---
No problem, knowing the problem is the only way to somewhat avoid it. It's funny that you can fast travel and log out alright but changing your hat screws it up.
---
I use a lot of grenades so the first days after the bug was introduced were really gamebreaking, every time I switched grenades or runned out of them I got my melee or ranged weapon replaced with useless bare fist that at most can block.
---
I thought so too, it hit home a bunch of times. A lot of stuff in the game hits home. They really did their research.
---
Can you prove any of this, if not it is just pure speculation on your part. Also the 180k on this subreddit are probably a small percentage of the true amount of people who play the game daily. 
---
3 days since the last Bethesda employee commented on anything, radio silence is well under way here
---
You know, all the guys run over before they run out of lube
---
Cant tell what im suppose to see
---
Or Insult Bot!
---
What is that? I can’t see it clearly..
---
Shit; repair kits? I've been out of the loop for three days.
---
What is it?
---
Please take your upvotes and keep moving. Thank you.
---
He said they would have to have the canvas made, which implies that they couldn't get any that was already made.
---
Guess I should have spelled it Mr handy whored
---
1: Not sure, someone else fill me in.
---
2: Yes, sadly.
---
3: What platform
---
The mods announced that they’re deleting any posts relating to the repair kits now, cause people are just using it to ride the karma wave. Don’t think that people aren’t still pissed about it, they are.
---
Some people drop stuff when over encumbered. How would the finder know?
---
Plus, come on, who could resist a bag of screws, adhesive, black titanium and ballistic fiber? I would have left the rest.
---
If you were always gonna pick that trade, what's it matter? 
---
What’s the vendorbots name? I need to find that!
---
Me too. My lever action doesn’t survive clearing West Tek. Gonna save this post and try OP’s fix. 
---
The father, the son, and the holy goat
---
It's always a Enclave experiment 
---
How the hell are you so lucky to find those haha. I've never just "found" one of those high quality weapons. The only thing I've found was an explosive nocturnal gatling gun, which pretty much sucked if it was daytime, because of nocturnal, so it was very situational, so I just sold it haha
---
It's only good for melee grinding gouls or nuke zones.  It really should not be used for anything else unless your s pve hoarder.
---
The whole system can be buggy. I just farmed mutations on my second character recently. You can still only acquire one mutation per server. When taking rads, sometimes it'll stop the radiation damage for a few seconds and resume after a few seconds. Sometimes you'll get a mutation and it won't show a notification, so always check after you've taken a lot of radiation damage. Sometimes you'll get notifications pop up that have already been displayed previously so it can get confusing. This is just like when you log on you'll often times have a bunch of notifications pop up from a previous session. You can still get all the mutations, aside from having both carnivore/herbivore of course. 
---
I kind of like the frustration of trying to communicate with a limited vocabulary.
---
Just my two caps worth....
---
I was thinking if it's not for knuckles, it's for a tire iron. 
---
Sorry guys I didnt realize how bad the quality was. It's a skeleton riding a tricycle.
---
I made a thread identical a week ago. Even suggested to use the "curator" perk to activate this ,like starched genes does for mutations.
---
I only got 2 replies: one guy just didn't care,one agreed.
---
Pretty much nobody gave a shit.this feature was so litimed since the beginning that is not even a problem how poorly it's designed.
---
It’s the most beautiful thing in the game!
---
Speaking of, anyone selling serums on Pc? 
---
Got it and the western duster. Look out varmints 
---
I accidentally did it once when I  had chameleon armor on and I spam crouched and accidentally used a stealth boy and I was walking around invisible permanently until I crouched again and I lost it.
---
Hello
---
Do you know how to use reddit add me psn NickNoPicks16 
---
Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.
---
&gt;And you can get a recipe for Red Ant Beer from Biv, which gives 50lbs
---
That wild be more awesome if ants weren't stupidly rare. 
---
Sure, it's an item that repairs your gear to full condition. Some people enjoy aspects of the game that don't require us to tediously repair crap. It doesn't heal you. It's not like stimpacks are being put in the atom shop. Also it's available in game. So why waste atoms if you can get a better version in game. Whats wrong with giving players more options than less? How is it pay to win? Repairing my gear to full condition without Fix it good or Weapon Artisan? You think if I can repair my own gear on the spot that you will get rekt in PVP? Nah. Also, atoms are available to get in game. Some of us have a lot of atoms and not through purchasing it with money (I'm sure some dumb dumbs think you can only buy atoms with real money.) So now I can use my atoms for something more expendable instead of sitting on it going to waste because i'm waiting for "Glamours". Would you like to respond with your own opinion? 
---
People tend to dump stuff in containers near the door of Whitesprings Train Station and at Watoga Station.
---
so a reskinned deathclaw?
---
Very interesting /s
---
I use it because i like it but simple armor is better in 80% of the times.
---
Don't get why some people were downvoting you for asking a fucking question lmao. 
---
It would take 316 days and a half anyway. If some one is crazy enough to be willing to do that for 7,6 bucks in Atoms, hell just let them have it.
---
They were only a couple levels behind the roadmap for me if it’s any consolation
---
So how would you have it work? would it be better if they removed the rewards for claiming a workshop or had a timer that doesn't let you reclaim the workshop for x amount of time? or would it cost caps to relinquish a workshop? just trying to flesh out how it would work cuz if you could just unclaim it people would exploit that to get the rewards for claiming it. 
---
Most likely someone who farms stealthboys. 
---
Pretty sure those are left-over effects from 4, at the very least the increased durability is. 
---
It's only there for the LuLz.
---
You guys have a serious problem with fev.
---
No one PvPs in power armour because it's too expensive to repair. I think the hit box is bigger too. 
---
they said they'd delete posts over 2 days old and post that have nothing substantial like "game bad pay2win". 
---
I guarantee you bethesda knew you'd all stop posting about it after a few days, start talking about the new update and then they'll put the repair kits in the game anyway.
---
Cane here to say the same thing
---
*thumbs up emote*
---
Do you ever use any other weapons?
---
Happened to me once, was scorched horse, thought about posting but I didn’t have pics so I figured I’d be called a liar.
---
For once I'd rather it not be confined to a megathread with tiny comments that nobody reads.
---
100% they're waiting for the posts to die down. You all get excited for sheepsquatch and THEN the repair kits get put in.
---
In Survival you can hear them coming from a long distance… and with a bloodied comando or sniper build… well, PA it's not OP
---
Karma works pretty good for reddit trading
---
In the roadmap that showed what we'll be getting in Fall of this year there was a small picture of the Vault Boy waving at a robot, so I think it will be like Automatron (the absolute best Fallout 4 DLC, fight me).  
---
I certainly hope so anyways, I miss my buddy Bunsen, a Protectron with the Mr. Handy jet, a Shishkebab and a Flamer for arms, and a cowboy hat from a mod.  He was easily my favorite bot, even though he wasn't the most powerful, he was loyal.  Hoenstly may do another Fallout 4 playthrough just so I can use him exclusively as my companion.
---
Lots pvp in armor..what’s pisses me off with vats is it locking onto downed turrets..ughhh screws me every time 
---
Terrifying
---
I’m pretty sure the shotgun heals per pellet because when I hit a flying scorchbeast from far away it heals me a little bit and when I hit something with all my pellets it heals a lot. But you don’t have a problem with the heals not happening sometimes? Curious
---
Should’ve nuked their camp and the level 200 cuckboy
---
Base damage does increase with weapon level. Craft a lvl 1 pipe pistol vs the highest lvl pipe pistol you can and you will see the difference immediately. I'm at work right now so I cant check, but it is possible that your damage modifiers (rifleman, commando, etc) only change the listed damage when you actually equip the weapon.
---
Did you eat any firecaps or mushrooms before this?
---
“they said they’d delete posts over 2 days old and post that have nothing substantial like “game bad pay2win”
---
This is a good thing, it prevents spam and karma whoring. They also said they would be deleting posts that didn’t contain any new information to limit duplicate posts. What exactly did you expect, the entire subreddit to just be filled with anti-repair kit posts until they change their minds(which won’t happen)?
---
MONARCH TO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD!
---
Wyd on this sub 
---
I only played a couple hundred hours of the Witcher 3 and that was a great game I liked.
---
I mean this is fallout children have automatic immortality 
---
No? He asked what they were doing in an area that they were allowed to be in. You seem offended. 
---
I hope so. 
---
Yeah, they really need to add this to the list of options when you are in your inventory. I wasn't aware (on XBox) of the ability to place PA using A, as the only option that shows on the screen when looking at PA in your inventory, is X for Drop.
---
Lost a set of Excavator Armor and a set of X-01 (due to glitches/crashing) before some googling revealed what I should have been doing. Easy fix I would have thought.
---
Idea! The next cryptid they should mention nothing just slowly drop stuff about it in the game! Make it passive and make it run if a player is close. Give us a real cryptid hunt
---
"now everyone like up for your vault exiting coffee enema!"
---
*Mr.Handy approaching*
---
"Warning! The coffee you are about to receive is *super* hot!"
---
didn't had to delete it, I saw the picture perfectly. 
---
 316 days one of  the servers will have one player less. That's not ok
---
I havent yet but hopefully will be with targeting hud and stealth boy mod
---
It doesn't work with other players.
---
Imagine coming on that thing in the night xD
---
Totally agree.   
---
Add playing on pool tables and the dart board too.
---
For the love of God, this. 
---
Dang well looks like i wont be buying one
---
I believe we can still be injured from things in the environment, exploding vehicles..
---
Ive literally had this issue since launch.
---
I have a pretty big camp with a bunch of crops, as long you build stuff away from high traffic areas your camp will be fine.
---
I have no issues with my handmade rifles. Maybe your rifles have crap initial durability. 
---
I will definitely shit my pants if that thing is fast in any way shape or form...
---
You can push numbers 1-9 on your keyboard if you use PC, easier than the wheel imo.
---
Dude whats the mod called
---
Thanks for the tips. I just never noticed it spoiling so fast before. It’s quite annoying. I need to find a better way to manage my weight and stash load. 
---
That would totally defeat the purpose of vendor limitations like this, though.  They took out bartering for a reason, so you could get craploads of loot without breaking the economy and constantly clearing out vendors.
---
Not like the raiders have a problem with killing people 
---
I started a new character, and I have seen nothing but pretty much full servers on level 40's and below. So something is right
---
I see them pop up at lucky holes mine occasionally. Try there next time you log in.
---
[Strong loved that]
---
You are correct, I just looked, it's the Stalker's Sickle. 40% swing speed, 100% vats accuracy at 50% cost and +1 agility, not strength.
---
They been gifting small stuff with pretty much every update, hope it stay that way...
---
Make some poker tables and make the damn Pool table playable. Call it Nuka hold em and Nuka 8 ball. Hell I'm not asking for my full rooftop basketball court to work but it would be nice too ;-)
---
He's been trash clickbait for monetization since this games release. He has no real interest in it beyond his channel. tell youtube you don't want to see it and ignore it. 
---
Outrage news on the game won't trend forever (I'm sure views are already much less) and he'll move on.
---
Unless it was some Diablo level damage where you’re doing billions of damage per hit lol
---
Good to hear!
---
The mothman leader
---
They clearly wanted caps to be less important in this game.  They are not used much and you can’t acquire them quickly.
---
Fun idea: the bank gets attacked as a server event once every 12 hours and the we have to defend it or everyone who is logged on and has caps invested in the bank loses 3% to 5% of their caps.
---
&gt;until they change their minds(which won’t happen)?
---
This is literally why companies never change their minds. Because you put up with it.
---
Omg... It’s beautiful 😍 I hope they roam in hordes, and I hope they drop some fun things!
---
 If you see a person in that picture you must want grahm on a runway lol
---
Haha not this time
---
I remember seeing that door in there and wondered what would be behind it, can't say I was expecting a vault hahaha
---
In a way I feel you , but fallout 76 entertains me in a different way in comparison to fallout 4 so going back would be pointless 
---
I have to suit up before I zone home since I'm on a river and it spawns me mostly underwater which gives me parasites every time I don't
---
thanks, got a deal working for one for 2k
---
Thank you for letting me know such a show exists!
---
A bit of everything tbh, were are the remnants of the  cultural past of America, Great Britain and the European Commonwealth. also some of the remnants founding members came from a now dying/dead player faction, we were  the only active members left after the previous update nerfs dwindled the faction player base 
---
Yes workshops will get you killed every time, just a matter of time. You can't do anything but hide if you don't want a desperate PvP wannabe to murder you and destroy your stuff.  Workshops are a necessary evil for fusion cores and acid. Thinking about building on an acid vent as I truly hate workshops and the PvP murder build players. BSG needs to make PvP only available in survival.
---
PC!
---
It's a blessing from atom.
---
Note: I accidentally deleted this comment, dont ask I'm really stupid, but in all sincerity thank you too whoever gave me a gold medal.  Didnt think that comment would even give me a medal at all.
---
Dual scorch beast is how I lost the plant recently. Four people came to take the plant, abused the one person flags while the others protect him thing. Killed them anyways, only for a dual scorch beasty attack to start. The beasties seemed obsessed with bombing me and ignored the other four. Finally gave up on the facility, killed the two beasties and started fighting the attackers only to be disconnected. ;_;
---
There really are some awesome situations and fights that come up, if they’d just stabilize the damn servers.
---
I’ve witnessed our great lord in person at the lighthouse, as many know, us cultists do a ritual there every time the fireflies come. 
---
If your lucky, you may see him there yourself!
---
I’ve come face to face with him once outside of the rituals. 
---
As for that flatwoods fella? Apparently, around Abbie’s bunker. Once saw him near white springs lookout and fissure site. 
---
Deep it said it was deleted until now I am stupid :b
---
Def not how I did it
---
Stupid question but do you need any made? If you have lead and steel, I'm sitting on a lead deposit for the same reason 
---
I'm not bored in any sense, I was just curious as to what other people do at 50+.
---
For example, alot of people keep saying "hit up whitesprings" and such but what do you do at white springs? As I didnt really do much there leveling, so what makes it a hotspot at 50?
---
Well, there are a lot fewer than who were originally playing it, thata for sure. Still, there are a dedicated cohort of players.
---
I, being the insufferably stubborn BoS fanboy that I am, made it to around level 20-ish before marching off for Abbie’s Bunker and throwing myself into their questline in the Cranberry Bog region.
---
Level 86 now.
---
No regrets.
---
I feel they could be a little bit more useful if there were reverted back to their original state where everyone could get something from a single supply drop. I do enjoy your idea.
---
I play both so I can see the benefits and pitfalls of both but I get where ya coming from amigo - have fun in the Commonwealth :)
---
It's just rng. I've picked up two explosives. One sucked, and one was a Junky's handmade. Now I find that I can't get addicted...
---
Nah, I'd like to think of it as a lifestyle choice 
---
For future reference, it comes from completing Signal Strength. The first of the quests that come from Rose.
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
Only if I miss, then it doesn’t heal. 
---
I'd give them wiggle room for that. Lets say your arm is injured or your durability is 12% maybe theres some sort of hole or exposed area. Since this game doesn't detect those stats as a reaction to getting "bit" or said exposure. Ill let it slide. Disconnected from their god awful issues and left with the rot,  lowered food and water and no buffs. Now you made me angry.
---
Nobody PvPs in Power Armor because its trash compared to good armor. My Ballistic/Energy resistance is higher than my friend in Power Armor. Also, your Armor is unequipped in PA so you don't get your Legendary effects
---
Huh?
---
This is a method. It's fun when you do it.
---
I use plenty
---
Right but at least its something we want.
---
Lol.
---
I'm gonna have to save up caps for y'all!
---
They do occasionally pop up there, and there's usually some at the substation north of Watoga (if the death claw doesn't get them first), but those are basically the only consistent spawns.
---
I feel like they should be much more common in lower level areas, and for realism sake they should spawn at places where food is served/made like mama dolce, the pub in Morgantown, the dairy company, etc... 
---
Exactly
---
Lots of enemies and legendary enemies that are easy to farm and drop a good amount of legendary gear which you can sell if it's nothing you'll use. (With the upcoming legendary vendor you'll also be able to trade them I guess). You'll also level quite easy there :)
---
Yeaaah. And those kids will probably be legally able to drink by the time this actually works. 
---
Can we tag some Bethesda peeps? I don't remember the names.
---
If you look back at the camp e3 video there is some kinda robot pod in peoples camps too. I would love robots because I seem to have a curse where everyone I friend just goes offline forever also I would feel okay with using a robot as a bullet sponge (no offence Evil AIs) 
---
Thats just not an excuse.  They can easily come up with cosmetic microtransactions that people would be clamoring to pick up because there's already so much backstory/ lore for fo76 to go off of.  There can be cosmetic only micro transactions and still make enough money for updates
---
(Don't even get me started on releasing a half baked game at full price and then using microtransactions as an excuse to finish the game)
---
You can farm the Ghouls for xp and legendaries. Also players tend to hangout there, and do trading around the golf club. There's also good junk... All and all its one of the best well rounded areas in the game.
---
Walking to my camp in the mire at 3 a.m. just got scary..... 
---
When you say "made out of Communist Chinese spy poop", the poop part it's like, not litterally poop right?
---
I read the terminals in [the secret communist base below, wow those guys were pricks and shot their own people](/spoiler) but I don't remember anything shady about the food itself.
---
I'd love to see a server list implemented too.
---
Baa
---
Nah. Mothman isn’t a radiated creature, he’s just a cryptid. Same with sheepsquatch. 
---
Contrary to what it seems like you believe, the sole purpose of this sub is not to brigade Bethesda when they do something you don’t like. And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the normally active community managers have not responded to a single one of the repair kit posts. This means one of two things.
---
1.) Bethesda doesn’t give a shit
---
2.) They are instructing their CM’s not to say anything about the subject, which means that either: again, they don’t care, or that they are preparing an official statement.
---
Ah, so much better!
---
Able to move your camp to a lead deposit? You're welcome to use mine if you need to 
---
Oh it was epic for awhile. I kept two turrets up on the loading dock and kept repairing the static base guns  but drawing the beast fire by running away from the guns. They probably did the most damage.  Then I’d go in to heal and they’d wipe out the guns. Rinse repeat. Best damage of course is getting them to damn well land!  But those by guns can do some damage to them. 
---
And the one guy had actually wanted me to come back for my stuff. But I simply enjoyed that fight and adventured north finding the unmapped rift. And a cabin. But after two scorchbeast kills there ammo running low I couldn’t even get in there to poke around because it spawned a third!  So run time. Junks easy to find. Good battles not so much. 
---
I'd settle for a perk card tree that shows enemy HP bar and damage ticker as well
---
JAYSUS CHRIST ON A CHRISTMAS THEMED POGO STICK! That is frightening!
---
Kinda unrelated 
---
I know all those rare moments where I thought, damn son. I would have won that battle if I had a repair kit. Where were you when weapon repairs kits ruined the game. Show me something thats a actual tactical advantage and i'll concede. Most people run around with a ton of backup weapons anyway, I don't really care. More power to you, REPAIR KITS ARE MURDER.
---
I didn't read it properly, sorry. People still do all those things though 
---
They’re very different cryptids. 
---
PSA: "Mr Handy Horde" is what the OP is joking about
---
lol the outrage. This is just something for  the paypigs to suck up. who here doesn't carry 2-3 back up weapons anyway.
---
Guess they died in the blast zone and other players took their junk??
---
PSN Savage_dadpool
---
If you ever see me online I’m game to get together and take down a scorchbeast or clear a couple high level areas with you
---
Could be old files otherwise get prepared for people roaming around with 3-star legendary power armour.
---
HOLY MOTHER MARY ON A GO KART!
---
Alright, dope. What does that have to do with my original point that saying the game is pretty doesn't invalidate everyone's criticism of the game design as picking through Todd Howard's shit?
---
It kind of defeats the point of the joke though :\
---
Could do it at a train station when you’re being killed a lot. stealth boy, drop PA, run and hide and wait for someone to stumble upon it
---
A Sheepsquatch helmet would be cool.
---
Yeah if you go back high level it’s always 45. 
---
Looks like a smaller version of the fiend from Witcher 3, or a Leshen
---
I mean I could t care less about cap farming, I just meant have they added new content
---
I'd love to see that. Given the fact that on PC, the vast majority of good gear flat out \_cannot\_ be had with cap trades anyway, due to this fucking moronic 25K cap max purse? It's nuts. 
---
That one guy walking against the walls to prevent the afk timer will always be in our hearts.
---
Honestly, YouTubers are worse than game journalists. By a WIDE margin. 
---
Time for some sheepsquatch stew.
---
I hope it’s tameable, I need this at my camp
---
Friends, but they have all stopped playing.
---
How much per bullet?
---
A level 67 one shotted me and my buddy today. First time that happened. I'm a level 16, buddy is level 13. 
---
Said the guy had a perk to get criticals on toes? Haven't confirmed that yet.
---
I thought if someone shot you unprovoked it wasn't supposed to do much damage.
---
I am level 280 and I found this player shot them about 10 times in the head with vats crits took like half his heath then he turned around and one shot me with an explosive gun which instantly took away like 600 caps. So I don't play survival things need changing but they should prioritize pve content because that's what this games fans seem to like. 
---
Good tip! It always happens just as you are getting attacked... I noticed a bug where if your weapon breaks it gets stuck as the last weapon used and tells you you gotta fix it. You can equip another weapon then another weapon which should reset the last weapon but you keep getting the busted weapon showing up. Annoying!
---
I’m surprised Bethesda is pushing their PvP so hard. No one really cared for it at launch, why they continue to try and push it surprises me
---
Spoiler Alert:
---
Daily: kill 76 sheepsquatch while wearing a sheep outfit
---
Daily: kill sheepsquatch while drunk on moonshine (0/20)
---
Weekly: Complete events while wearing a sheep outfit
---
Weekly: Level up 76 times while wearing a sheep outfit. 
---
Make optional though, some people don't like them
---
A mission that rewarded his skull and horns as a helmet would be badass.
---
It’s a responder bot, pretty sure that is the name you can see the group in the background 2-3 eye bots a pack Brahman and the protectron  robot (vender). As far as I know he only spawns at the Charleston station and is a rare encounter to have. Can take hours to spawn. Sells rare outfits and two plans. 
---
 Not sure if I agree.  Regardless you would be getting the same amount of money for the items sold and the vendors would only have the same amount of total caps.  Right?
---
Basically how I did it. Except I went from 38-52? grinding Fasnacht trying to get that goddamn jester mask. Emphasis on trying because no one got that shit haha!
---
&gt; because it's too expensive to repair. 
---
That's not really the case anymore, especially with Power Patcher 3. With Fix it Good 3 + Power Patcher 3, PA takes so long to break that you'll have gotten the materials required to repair a full set several times over by the time you do need to repair it.
---
&gt; I think the hit box is bigger too. 
---
I'm not sure about that one. Has anyone done testing regarding this?
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
The real reasons PA is not advised in PVP is:
---
1. PA pieces can't have legendary effects. This is probably the biggest one.
---
2. PVP damage scaling makes everyone not stacking as much damage mitigation as possible die in 1-5 shots even with very high DR/ER/R resistance numbers.
---
3. Stacking armor penetration is a popular choice in builds.
---
Basically, PA's high resistance numbers means squat in PVP and it can't have legendary effects so there's no point in using it over legendary armor pieces that have decent rolls. 
---
You are aware that there are multiple servers running at once, on which there is the possibility of multiple nukes being launched at once, right? The possibility the people you're talking about know who you are, is very slim, especially since there is so much looting going on in nuke zones (of dead players and enemies) that they wouldn't know they even took your loot, unless they killed you and took it. In which case, they probably killed more players than just you so they still dunno who you are.
---
Anti-armor doesnt effect energy dam.
---
When you finish the main storyline at ~25. 
---
Save the best for last? Hell no. Lets do this...I respect your choice haha
---
I ran for the maya to be the first person on pc to join the enclave my pip-boy now permanently says that the 2nd quest I started is bunker buster. I guess everyone can play how they like this is the beauty of this game.
---
u/lonewanderer
---
if you use chameleon armour and spam the crouch button when you stand up if done right will keep you in chameleon even when standing or running so you can permanently be invisible until you crouch and wait for the chameleon sound effect then when you stand up the effect comes off and your visible again.
---
Works with PA too if you spam crouch then enter PA you will be invisible in power armour without having to use stealthboys and the effect is permanent till you exit PA. :)
---
Thanks. I wondered why the level 35 stuff  I found looked just like the level 5 stuff!
---
I’ve been revisiting fo3, 4 and nv since hitting an end to active quests in 76. I seriously miss the NPC interaction. I know it was all scripted and the interaction is really fake. I still miss it.
---
I keep hoping the BOS will storm into Appalachia with a vengeance to try and put an end to the Enclave. 
---
Maybe one of the other vaults will open and inject a mass of population.
---
So?
---
I've already had notifications to retake workshops overrun by Sheepsquatches, but they're gulpers when I show up.
---
Don't use rad recover chems.  Use a shower.  Equip Starched Genes 2 any time you lose rads.  Do your mutation farming at the Emmett Mountain Disposal Site just inside the door to the underground area.  Make sure to clear the 2-3 spawns in the nearby area and don't go down the ramp.
---
I'm almost certain the "timer" where you can't take rads is related to a petrified corpse's radiation effect wearing off after it crumbles, at least at the site I mentioned.
---
If it helps, here's a tip:  Wear power armor.  Park the power armor at the "hottest" spot next to one pallet of barrels.  Get out of the armor and go stand on the same kind of spot by the other pallet.  You can take &gt;22 rads that way and it speeds up the grind.
---
Emmett Mountain has a decontamination shower right next to the entrance by the barrels.  You can rack up mutations really quickly there.
---
Ah well.  Glad it is more stable, but do wish it didn't make me act OCD as a cost.
---
Mack Beth say milk make humans strong, stronger than super mutants!
---
...I mean, at least you're trying to push a little RP into this. But "cohesion" and "raiders" is like "herding cats" and "raiders that aren't just griefers". Not something you see often. 
---
So why post this?
---
No, they are clearly suppositories - much faster access to the bloodstream than the oral route. 
---
I destroy camps of players just farming and not doing nothing else
---
somone needs to higher this guy over at bethesda game studios and make him director of ideas. 
---
Try this but with smoked mirelurk fillets that take boatloads more materials and are supposed to last 90 minutes, unless you die or disconnect. So... it’s a good day when they wear off naturally. 
---
You do realize that the gulper is technicly a reskinned deathclaw as well. Just because it is a re model doesn't mean it will not have unique gameplay. 
---
True. It's easier to just connect your fusion generator to the extractors.  Back before most plans were available from the vendors, it was the only way to get generator plans. I would do poisedon over and over and get fusion plans to sell. Anymore it's not worth it.
---
I would love to read about its lore.
---
Wendigo in folklore had goat skull as a head and deer antlers.
---
I don't think tom Howard needs any more ideas to milk real money outta us for non tangible shit (which he then claims is limited - it's fucking virtual and not limited!!)
---
I agree, to a point. If you disconnect and go back in, unless you get right back into the same server, chances are you'll be put in another server where the workshop hasn't been claimed or the power plant hasn't been powered up, in which case it makes sense. But yes, if you do manage to get back into the same server after a disconnect, it should still be your workshop. There should be some kind of time limit to get back on before the workshop is abandoned or power plant shuts back down.

I got one buddy with 1300+ hours logged
---
Ok . I'm level 67. Gt Riolus31
---
Hard to say. I started an alt, and once it leveled enough to farm properly, he got wayyy better stuff than my main. He picks up tons of ts weapons, bloodied, etc. meanwhile all my main picks up are wood armor pieces and legendary rolling pins
---
No. This has happened with some buffs for a long time now, months in fact. It’s probably to do with the fix to the carry weight exploit. It still sucks. 
---
yes - for only 40000atoms

Good finally someone who doesn't demand human NPCs for fallout 76 because with my disordered ass I can't understand the story though dialog but I can though environmental storytelling and since that was the focus for 76 it's superb here, I would be fine if they dropped NPCs but kept the same level of detail with the environment but I don't think that's the case based on how Fallout 4 was for me.
---
It happens when you die, too. 
---
Yes, they should.
---
But, fuck, could people stop making the same post every 30 minutes?
---
Yep I have a scavver build, and pvp build so far but it takes some time rearranging those cards
---
Auto loading gernade launcher

If still needed you can add me. Level 188 and usually play daily. BigBangTheory73 
---
it's related because I refuse to play this game anymore until they get it through their head that non-cosmetic items in the atom shop are not acceptable after promising it'd be cosmetic only, so I'm not going to get to experience the Sheepsquatch until then.
---
Gets on all fours and moves as quickly as a Radstag.
---
This is 5hours old bud.
---
Because I wanted to...
---
Chess would be very easy to do, a turn based game. Maybe have like designated tables for them
---
YongYea has proven himself time and time again to be a sensationalist over a journalist, choosing to report the popular opinion under the guise as news and not objective news in general. 
---
Plus I'm pretty sure when I sleep at night, he crawls out from under my bed and punches me.
---
I’d shit my pants period.
---
Its a glitch thats been going on for a while. There's a notification about sheepsquatch attacks or hordes or whatever, but when you get there its not a sheepsquatch. It'll be something else.
---
If you're on PS4, I'll buy the ultra-light leather limbs
---
Berry Mentats. YW.
---
yep! legit quoted your comment :) - google it
---
Yes, please. Even with a mic, there's sometimes a language barrier. Expanded emotes would help greatly.
---
I am not. Sorry I forgot to put my platform 
---
Don't do bobble heads kids
---
Hey. Im on almost everday. Evenings during the week. Gamer tag Hardcorezen99. Been wanting to team up. Mostly play solo. Lvl 45 and a lvl 10 Im trying a Pistol Build with to make things a bit more challenging.
---
So far ive got a camp/crafting build, pvp build, and pve build.
---
Okay?
---
i think it was left out for either making the game feel more unique from FO4 or because they felt the laser musket could make an interesting weapon to be released later
---
More like an Arktos Pharma experiment ;)
---
You should have dropped some spoiled meat on the toilet
---
I’m a little disappointed. Tbh it feels very much like a death claw 
---
I was thinking something similar as well! 
---
Aye, fair enough.
---
True but i dont like that i get highlighted as well
---
Hyperbole -- Hi-per-bole-li.  Your word for today. 
---
Should just unlock the whole atom shop at this point.
---
i feel like they could take your advice and rework the event at the morgan town airport with this feedback
---
I'm fairly certain that some of the in game cabins were built with the set, which is almost guaranteed to be released at some point. [The cabins at Watoga State Park](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/24/c2/bb/24c2bb456551db640f97cc46286f6d21.jpg), IRL, would be a great build set. I would love a similar rail, support beam, and mossy rock floor piece in to go with it.

Sexy

I predict my wife and kids will be woken by the sounds of a teenage girl screening like she just got her first puppy... and a foul smell.
---
Energy weapon gang, I run a TSE Laser Rifle, Instigating Plasma Sniper, TSE Tesla, and TSE Gauss. They're still slightly behind ballistic weapons but not by much 
---
I love pistols but I cannot for the life of me find good legendaries for the .44, western, or 10mm.
---
yeah i hadn't heard about that change since i left sometime in mid january and i hope they revert that if they dont it would be nice to see the flare be extinguished once it was looted
---
Yeah, yeah, you miss being the center of the world.  we get it.  Maybe tells us more about you than the game.
---
I have a bloody plasma rifle if you're interested 
---
B-b-but there is no morale skill in dnd
---
Bump for reminder!
---
You can still shoot us friend requests for when you get there. 
---
that's the issue with a lot of drama-following youtubers. they feel they have to remind you about every slight Bethesda has ever done while pretending the good things never happened to make you want to raise your pitchforks and torches all over again. It's scummy and manipulative (which I believe is a word YongYea likes to use a LOT if I remember correctly)
---
I read that totally wrong whilst skimming through...
---
Oh please no. The last thing this game needs is toxic dick, I mean DPS, measuring.  
---
The shoes with the vintage coat are ghastly 
---
So the Kirby butterfly 
---
Asked and answered. Find something to do, start over or quit.
---
I was thinking the same thing, it would be a pain in the ass to retro-actively apply the changes to existing outfits, but honestly its been a player thing FOR ages, besides angering some modders who did it first and the entire bethesda stole my idea backlash it seems LESS painful and MORE lucrative to do it now than down the road. 
---
If i remember right (highly suspect) the engine already supports 50-ish item slots so really its a question of do they want community cash for cosmetics or do they want to pursue other forms of items for revenue.
---
Got something better to do then shitpost on reddit?
---
It does.
---
Nice one. Grats!
---
One handed can be good. I tried it out and it was fine. But then I found a level 50 instigating super sledge. Then a level 50 furious buzz blade. Both at the Whitespring.
---
I know that doesn't help, but there ya go. Lol
---
half is not "few". Also you have no evidence of your numbers, and there's a saying that goes "90% of all statistics are made up on the spot". If you don't understand the meaning of it, 90% is obviously an exaggeration, but also the main point of the statement, as biased people trying to make a point will exaggerate their findings, skewing the numbers to fit their agenda.

Tom Howard? Todd or Rons less successful sibling?

The Enclave is actively recruiting for the Xbox cell; we have a few, but hope to grow!

Regardless, GT TheGr8Nekodamus 
---
Well, it's more like churned than brewed.
---
Looks like it needs a hug. 
---
&gt; because people where stealing the stuff. 
---
Stealing what stuff?  Get one hit in and you get the full inventory.  Even when you getb no hits you get mass/fluids/irradiated meat out of most corpses/meat pies. 
---
Valid point.
---
Can’t tell if compliment or
---
I hunt 3 star enemies. Events. Specific locations, random spawn points. I server hop and do every event on the map. If the loot is good I stay on that server and hit my prefered locations. If not I hop into the next world.
---
Harper's Ferry and the surrounding area. Generals steakhouse, Robco and the surrounding area. Westek. Maybe a pass through watoga. Those are a few.
---
I firmly believe the whitespring loot table is crappified to make up for the abnormally high legendary spawn rate. 
---
Stacked log walls and Forest green tin roof. I want more natural building to blend into the woods with
---
I'm so happy to know I'm not the only one annoyed by this 
---
Yeah I have totally disregarded that challenge, and use it to track how many hours I have clocked.
---
I mean, it has what looks like a fake cannon. Also, having a flag out front if hardly a weird thing there.
---
There is another house in Davis Creek (suburb of Charleston) that is more pronounced of this style. It's legit like 9 feet from the ground to when it spreads out. I'll see if I can get a Google map of it real quick. 
---
Hoping for something like this too!
---
Do you know by how much? Is it the best plan for combat armor?
---
I’ll Probably just claim a workshop tomorrow, get some lead from that 👍🏻
---
Yup, Emmott Disposal. Plus almost 50% you clear out mole miners and get black titanium, and there's a legendary deathclaw further in the dungeon.
---
How many bullets can you sell?
---
I'm on Xbox.
---
Grahm will buy it for 1k, but turns all other vendors hostile for 2 hours
---
Hey Guess, if you just google where Lead nodes are and pick one to make a camp at and set down a lead extractor, you will never run out of ammo. I run snipers, handmades and .44 pistols. Have 2000k+ of each round. I have to shut off the extractor generator because my stash gets too full with all the lead scrap I extract. Its awesome. 
---
to give you a better example on my combat armor chest piece which is heavy armor the next down from Bos is polymer which is 82 ,81 armor with BOS it's 87,86 so not a ton but some
