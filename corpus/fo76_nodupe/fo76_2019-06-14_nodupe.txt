Oh im not doubting the next big update.
---

---
What im really worried about is after that.
---
IMO this update is what really worries me for the future. Like I said, I don't think its any coincidence they have a free week with battle royale. That wont attract a fallout fanbase will it?
---
We will get our npc dlc. And I am sure it will be a big and buggy update. 
---
I bet after that we will see a lot of BR updates.
---
---
---
Hey there! I’ll help you out if you need it.  :)  I can offer aid, ammo, armour, and a hand in helping with combat. My PSN is radiationdaddy — feel free to hit me up anytime!
---
But women get the thumbs up?
---
The ritual masks are about to hit the atom shop, looking foreword to those myself so I can’t miss those.
---
I think that the success of this mode can only be a good thing. Beth have show through Wastelanders they are committed to expanding the Adventure mode in EXACTLY the way even it’s most devoted fans wanted. Having popular modes of play that are less development intensive (I assume, happy to be corrected) will help fund such efforts going forward. I suspect the game will continue to have things bolted on taht but everyone will like, but widening the appeal of the game widens the base of players prepared to support it which widens the capacity of Beth to continue expanding it in all ways.
---
Especially with the prompts at the main menu of how to quit the vault to get to BR. What is that about? Aside wanting Fortnite players.
---
Energy weapons are calculated against ER, energy resistance. Anti armor only reduces 50% of DR and is useless on energy weapons. Check either with awareness, or get 1* AA wnerfy, turn on damage displaying and compare it to crafted same energy weapon.
---
&gt; Many games I don't fight anyone until the final circles.
---
Does that... work? With Squads being the only mode available now, surviving on stealth doesn't seem practical. You might make it to the top 10, but it's extremely likely that you'll end up in a 1v4 situation, or going up against people decked out in better guns and consumables than you because they've looted a squad or two on their way to the final circle.
---
Oh ok. It has a quest marker on her but nothing will trigger, it would just say her generic dialogue and she's clipped to a wall 😂 I'm so lost now.
---
Lol I just think of South Park with that word.
---
If they are, the only thing to do is trade them for scrip
---
What’s the quest say that you have marked?
---
Uh huh...
---
Hmm, John Henry the super mutant... traveling vendor that only sells hammers and railroad spikes.
---
That's the quest where you have to get all the bug parts, yeah? If you do the Campfire Tales event (triggers at Camp Adams after 6 or 8pm, can't remember!) the majority of the creatures needed spawn as part of the event. You should only have to go to maybe one of the little circles to get a final piece.
---
There's a quest you (should) do after level 50 if you're 2 handed melee (because of legendary weapon it gives) that makes those assaultrons neutral. It's called Mayor for a Day. It's a nice weapon otherwise, too, but it drops at your level.
---
Scrap everything you're not using until you've learned the mods (unless you're selling it to make your 1400 caps, it's a tradeoff), and bulk the excess junk and sell it. You'll want to be able to mod those legendaries when they drop.
---
The map markers should be something players can do upon an area of the map to indicate 'come at me bro'. Current map markers are useful for this, but immersion breaking for everything else.
---
'The Missing Link'- Complete Rose's Quests to gain her trust
---
Very glad your trading issue is resolved!
---
It's possible that they've all muted themselves. Do you have the ability to test this with a friend to see if you can hear them?
---
I'm noticing that starting some time last week, there is a 50/50 chance that day's challenges are reasonable. I wonder if they're tracking completions to see what's considered unreasonable by the overall community. I know people have been (rightly) pissed at the exceedingly improbable if not impossible challenges for the last month or so.
---
I got mine by building a fertilizer generator.
---
Did you ever figure it out? Tried to do it last night and the same thing happend to me.
---
Its a fad that sadly Bethesda are chasing with the fallout franchise. Which depresses me as a fallout fan and somebody that hates BR.
---
She turned me into meet....well I got better.
---
No problem. Hope it helps.
---
Your camp will not be featured on fo76 cribs.
---
Camps are for flexing.
---
Maybe try a bit of adventure mode without VATS and similar guns from NW. just play and kill enemies as if they were other players and you can’t VATS. As you play, adjust the look sensitivities slightly until you find a zone where you can comfortably aim at and hit enemies.
---
&gt; Also, make sure that you claim that we both are Beth shills, and support cheaters at the same time! It brings me great joy! 
---
What bothers me is you mentioned both, as in 2 people. So are there really only 2 mods?
---
Area is an audio setting
---
No need to hold them under if they're tied up!  Witches float, so if she's innocent, she'll just sink and drown.  Witches can't breath underwater though.  Just float.
---
Balanced where they don't have a two shot, infinite ammo, explosive Gatling laser.
---
It’s broken af I’m not made since I left the game on Nov 28. 2018.
---
But what I’ve read from players it’s a Hackers Paradise that Battle Royale
---
They need to put their team to help of security of this game if they’re going through with this and let it survive like ESO or if they’re going to kill it. 
---
Hope not this game needs love and interest from Bethesda and not just send team B to supervise it.
---
... Both as in at the same time, not both as in two people
---
Shoot, I forgot all about role play. My character must be absolutely sick of corn soup by now.
---
You can craft all the unique items, the Tricentennial 10mm, Axe, and the Vault Boy stuff are all Atom shop things you already own due to having Tricentennial edition, you can apply the weapon skins at workbenches and craft the outfits in the Armor station.
---
They all mattered for me when I got 10k I was done
---
I played the game for most of the beta, and pretty often after the game released. I stopped playing by Christmas because a) I got RDR2 b) The servers were still garbage and c) There was just a lack of things for me to do. Since the E3 announcement, I’m back in the game and enjoying it
---
He also forgot to add the duffle kerfuffle, the ability to access other users Bethesda accounts and the stone cold silence from Bethesda while they were dealing with the shell shock.
---
Those of us that have truly enjoyed the game started panicking when we thought Bethesda had abandoned it.
---
Your favorite president.
---
That if I'd waited a year I could have picked it up for twenty bucks.
---
I think you should definitely get XP boost for downing and killing the same Target. The kills without the downing just means you're finishing people off which can be the easiest thing in the game honestly, if your team is knocking them down.
---
What does tagging them do exactly
---
You just need to look at fortnite.
---
That game started as a co op thing, and only had BR added after the success of PUBG.
---
Now look at it....
---
Like I said. Its no coincidence that a free week started with a damn BR mode. With the clear instructions of how to quit adventure to join BR its obvious imo what Bethesda want.
---
Same here. Got the e-mail from My UPS saying a package was on the way and was confused. Today i got the support e-mail saying it was sent out. Neat surprise!
---
Yeah, everyone basically painted it out to be the next No Man's Sky and acted like this was the end of Bethesda. 
---
Meanwhile somehow Anthem got a pass, probably because most people didn't care to actually play it and knew that it was Bioware's desperate attempt to appease their EA overlords.  
---
In addition there was drama over stuff like the canvas bags, and that was blown out of proportion again by the hate machine that was being propelled forward by Youtubers like Jim Sterling who rely on outrage drama to get those views up.  Hell there was one point where a big scare was created over a trading exploit _that didn't actually exist_ and had no actual evidence that it was real.  Yet people jumped on it and blew it out of proportion because they wanted it to be real and wanted to use that to further push their narrative.
---
Now they're basically scraping at the bottom of the barrel, taking the low hanging fruit of insulting Bethesda for making a Fallout BR mode (because enough people dislike the BR craze) and going "dUrrr HuMaN nPcS sHoUlD'vE bEeN a BaSiC fEaTuRe" as if they somehow didn't understand the original premise of the game.
---
Nah, I mean that some claim we are both things.
---
There are a lot of us, and we all put in hard work! It’s just that a lot of it is behind the scenes. We have a great mod team, and this sub requires constant supervision and care.
---
Throw her in the pond!
---
They're OP, so they skulls be super rare. You can stand in the storm and take less than 1 rad/sec, so if you've got a couple radaway you can survive the storm for quite a while.
---
Should it not have been "claim that we are both Beth shills, and support cheaters" not "we both"
---
They’re attached to your actual account, not per character.
---
Yeah because most atom shop outfits don't count as under-armor, they get taken off when you equip armor. The VTU tracksuit, Grafton tracksuit, Football outfit, etc are under armor, which will stay on under the wood, marine, scout armor, etc. It's just that they cant be equipped for nuclear winter.
---
There was a single car that had been rebuilt and was missing only a couple of components to run properly.
---
Same
---
Until this changes, I highly recommend building around existing in-game content in unmarked locations.
---
Lol I wish. Sadly I am a human that works for Starbucks.
---
Yeah I can, thanks for the help!
---
Lol I fuckin wish.
---
It makes it so that items with the components you search for have a magnifying glass next to them. 
---
So say you need aluminum, any junk items you find with aluminum in them will have a special icon when you go to pick up the item.
---
"The herbavores can have it too, but make theirs not as good."
---
Vegans already have it bad enough without meat eating gamers pushing their bias into video games :-p
---
I don't want no mutant tv crew coming into town scaring off the customers. Besides the fo76 crib for Kanawha Park is the underwater chem facility run by beefbellies. All there is above the water is a  doorwaytunnel going down. Its frakking sweet. Good prices on mixed chems.
---
What other quests do you have?
---
Megasloths are bigger, slower and easier to hit. And they don't shoot back. 
---
I actually use sniper rifles a lot in the main game. But that requires sitting still for a long time.
---
The other thing I typically use is melee. But I was having trouble even hitting people with this awesome Grognak Axe I picked up the other day. Guy was running around like a chicken with his head cut off and somehow still aiming and hitting me with a 10 mm while I swung and missed. Felt like I was playing The Show instead.
---
Blueprints can be buggy. There are some good YouTube videos about how to build camps that are consistently "safe". The easiest way is a foundation attached to stairs that leads to another floor, but some people don't like that aesthetic.
---
The comma after shills implies it's separate, hence the comment.
---
I've heard stories on here of people opening tickets with beth support for this exact reason and being refunded. You should try that if you're not a serial atom store refunder haha
---
How does the whole camp thing work? I'm an adventure vet, but I have no clue about base building in nw
---
Nuclear winter is great and all but i'm pretty disappointed that there was no mention of the vault raids that are suppose to come with nuclear winter and the prestige system that was advertised on the road map. Can we get an update on these next week on Inside the vault and when we might expect to see them please?
---
It doesn’t work all the time. However, as everyone is forced into the same “server” you get a lot of people  who have either lost a squad member due to lack of coordination/solo or duo players who have coordinated and made it to the end. There have really only been a handful of times where it has been a 1v4 situation and when it has, I almost certainly lose. Most of the time however it’s likely it is a 1v1v2 or something similar. Best advice for that is hide if at all possible (if that’s the style you are going for) and let them fight it out.
---
Who is this prick of which you speak op?
---
How long have u been playing?
---
Ha, yeah. Last match I was in only gun I found early on was a .44 revolver and I couldn't hit shit with it.
---
Pipe revolver is okay becausw it can double dip as pistol and rifle (gets bonus from both perks). If thats unintentional and will be patched, it will suck. But I agree with rest.
---
Why do survival?
---
I mean... looks like your english is quite solid.
---
Problem is - from my experience, an average of one player per random team is using his mic or reacting / listening to your calls. Sometimes two, sometimes none.
---
Bulking only saves space with aluminum and lead. Otherwise, it's the waste of plastic that is saving you space. Just bulk those two and what you're going to sell.
---
My question is more basic - where the heck do you get guns? How did the other guy spawn in with a combat rifle while I had nothing? LOL
---
They're cheater supporting Bethesda shills, not grammar nazis
---
Yes, so needed
---
I bought a plan after saving up, but thanks anyway!
---
They probably won’t stay in the game til the end anyway, no worries.
---
That was never a thing. Only rumors that were proven false. It does not increase at all.
---
I like the synergy of bringing two useless features together to make something new and arguably useful.  Now, maybe I won't drop/ignore the huge stacks of pre-war money you get from government supply drops and Mr. Prize-Bot.
---
Yeah Oxhorn got a ridiculous hatemob after him for daring to show the game in any positive light.
---
Yeah survival it sounded fun
---
Snipers are a strange situation when it comes to NW. they don’t do enough damage to completely take someone out. IF you manage to hit them, you have to hit them again before they shoot back or stim. If snipers were balanced to be strong enough for one hit kill headshots they’d be a lot better in terms of risk/reward payoff.
---
Melee is awful in NW. Unfortunately, I’m unsure as to how they could balance it to make it more in line with guns, without giving a major advantage to melee users?
---
That's the only one for the main quest and side missions I have continue overseer's journey. The miscs have no relation to rose quest. I'm thinking it might be a glitch or I accidentally dropped the her syringe and her barrel mod for it. Is it possible to drop quest items?? Sorry for the questions, haven't played this game since launch.
---
I wonder what they talked about on the way up
---
The AI can use doors and stuff, never heard of them taking the lift though, lol
---
yeah, the hate train was super strong for 76 and Bethesda as there is no way 76, a game that has content and was semi-playable when it came out had a lower score than Anthem, a game that had no content and still isn't really playable
---
Here for a possible answer of how the heck you even get them.
---
No. I'm not here for a petty argument over whether or not it's mostly positive or negative because it's highly opinion based and unconstructive. I'm just pointing out that the positivity around this game I much much larger than it was a week ago.
---
Go to Watoga, follow the main road north. Eventually you’ll find a billboard, the entrance is around there.
---
I had a C.A.M.P. there, I assume it’s the area you’re talking about.
---
No you can’t drop quest items, I remember being stuck on part of this and it turned out to be because I had a quest I didn’t think was hers but was. Hmm..
---
PSA: if you log out the workshop is no longer yours. It’d be ridiculous and unbalanced to just let someone take a workshop and set it up with an insane amount of defenses and be able to log out and let it keep gathering resources for them.
---
They are the Whitespring resort planters. Unfortunately pretty expensive but you can make CAPS pretty fast selling purified water, knowing where CAPS stashes are around Whitesprings and having the CAPS stash perk on. (There might be easier ways to make CAPS but that's how I do it)
---
You get them as a random reward for doing the dungeon event at Arktos Pharma. We could team up to do it if you’re on ps4.
---
You go to atom shop and toggle it as NW outfit
---
If you haven’t played since November all I can say is use the free trial now and you’ll realize it’s much different. And if you watched the announcement you would see the game is far more than a battle royale.
---
Why do people always forget about the time they doxxed their own players? That one was massive yet nobody remembers it.
---
While in nw wait lobby go to atomic shop and select what you want
---
No.  Ghouls are made from living humans exposesd to ridiculous amounts of radiation, not shot-up corpses.
---
So after I just got checked out for my mini stroke I had. That’s good, I knew from the start this game was going to be rough. Given it to was that teams first fallout game, first multiplayer, and anything like this. I’m not arguing this game should of had more development time and the whole bag thing. That’s been my only major problem with the game. I’m glad people are giving this game a chance unlike the majority of YouTubers out there who are still shitting on this game.
---
Workshops are lost upon logging out. If you came back to the same server you could get it back but have to pay caps again.
---
Get one claimed when you first start then wait for the defend mission. After that just stop by to unload and head back out exploring!
---
Probably discussed how delicious I was going to taste.
---
Yeah, that's something I've even noticed with one of my friends who initially enjoyed the game until they let all the drama dictate their opinion on it.
---
[removed]
---
Look for the quests “Flavors of Mayhem” and “Links to the past”
---
Well then I guess I'll try that my next round
---
You’re a little late on this one to reply (almost 3 months.....) For one it’s open pvp you have no pvp flag to turn on or off so people can still kill you super easy if you are low level and they a much higher level. When I looked into it recently, last month-ish) despite the patch notes saying it was updated to not show a “longest alive” tracker on the map, it still did. You could still see little Timmy who was level 5 down in Flatwoods for example so al it took us anyone searching for kills to make their way there to kill him/her.  Maybe the upcoming patches have / will change it but until then it’s a griefers paradise which makes new low level players (or people rolling a new toon just for survival) pointless for “survival”
---
Awesome :) Let me know how you go
---
I guess that makes sense, suffice to say i wont be touching one until its hella worth it. 
---
Also no spoilers, im trying to go blind as much as i can 😁
---
FYI, you don’t retain your workshop when you log out, unless you log back into the same server and no one else has claimed it. 
---
Never expect to hold your workshop for even the entire gaming session. Unless you’re guarding it very carefully, it’s easy for someone else to claim it. 
---
Your ‘permanent home’ should be your CAMP. Find an area that suits your needs (location for vending, location for tactical fast travel, and/or with some valuable resource spot within range), and make that your own. 
---
Workshops are temporary; CAMPs are forever... unless you can’t find a server where your CAMP will be placed.
---
How long will you be on? I have three I can give you, no caps required. I won’t be on for about ten minutes if you can wait. PSN ID is ChibaBlackClinic.
---
Too bad you are not on xbox I have them in my vending machine for 40 caps each
---
Exactly, having them barge through a door is normal but god when that elevator door dinged open and they came charging out I shit my pants.
---
If we're going to keep asking for budget increases, can we move away from the C.A.M.P. acronym cause the small and portable image that the name implies becomes pretty much meaningless when people are making manions and forts.
---
I was thinking about that last night. Maybe they will with the full version.
---
Look at his battlefield 5 videos. Just gold with the amount of stupid
---
Microsoft may rent servers to 3rd parties but that does not mean they are on the same network. If they were any issues would effect everything and that just does not happen. You can't think of all microsoft servers just the ones being used for xbox.
---
I almost feel like a sniper would be a great support for a coordinated team. Like if you had a couple people with automatics going forward or some melee people soaking up damage and then a sniper pitching in damage from the back. But need people with headsets to make it work.
---
You have to toggle it as a favourite in the atomic shop. Took me a bit to figure that out lol.
---
I can picture the emote now. 2 people and a mob standing together. Lightning hits mob and arks to p2 who turns to ash heap. p1 shrugs and SORRY pops up.
---
Yes they will, this is just an alpha version
---
I think it would be epic
---
That can happen sometimes, but so far I’ve never permanently lost one. It’s annoying and a bit scary, though.
---
Aww, thanks so much for the offer! I'm on PC unfortunately :(
---
Thank you for this amazing open world. Thank you for keeping it updated. Playing it daily for a month now.
---
I mean, a good 3/4ths of the map is forest, there's far more plants to eat than there are animals.
---
No spoiler but claiming a workshop is a good way to get plans. So in a sense they’re still worthwhile.
---
No there is no option for underarmor just apparel.
---
Don’t forget the milk.
---
I’ll be on all day pretty much, I’d appreciate that.
---
You can contest it from anywhere in the build area. Might suck when they leave server though.
---
Wow, thanks for the tip, I will look into that! :)
---
Well my order of the tadpole is completely bugged out so I really can't get mine.
---
Are you sure? The vault 51 jumpsuit is considered under armour, and it’s in the atomic shop. Granted it’s part of the event, but still.
---
Tag anything you are short on. You can akways un-tag it later.
---
You will often be suprised to see that overlooked junk actually has what you need.
---
Ex: most toys have lead. You need lead for bullets. Also pencils.
---
Just got it for $17 :). It's a HUGE update download though. Won't be able to play for at least a day :(
---
Lol great thread
---
I have the plan for sale at my camp. Cheap! On PC.
---
They are working on it.  At least 3 other black and white maps have been leaked.  This is currently a sneak peak for 1 week and won’t be back for a little bit after the week.  They will fine tune it, work on trying to fix problems and glitches then fully release it, hopefully with more maps at that time.
---
I will love playing in Charleston and the mire, where there are way more ambush spots.
---
I thinking you may have been collecting the wrong wood, I also did that for the first time I did the event.
---
Well clearly you burn them at the stake, and if they die, they weren’t, and if they don’t, they are.
---
Same!
---
I didn't see the option for it under underarmor
---
I killed a puppy when I was 10 and the thrill made me feel more alive and fulfilled than i've ever felt since, but it's been over 10 years, so you should assume I'm a changed person.
---
I believe it only happens at night time
---
What platform?
---
Totes, learning how precious it is, especially for fast travel as a person without caps, but... Atm as a lv11, my camp is the savage divide after having a nukashine and being over encumbered &gt;. &lt;
---
Xbox one
---
I would scrap for the scripts
---
Scorched?
---
Too busy, myself, eating corpses to care if they add this or not.
---
I got them confused. Sorry about that! Don’t mean to spread disinformation.
---
no, you don't get what umbrella means, all exploits are cheats, not all cheats are exploits.  like how all rectangles are squares but not all squares are rectangles.  by definition using an exploit is cheating.
---
No worries!
---
There are small sticks on the ground marked kindling to pick up, not regular wood. There is a difference. They are in the zones around certain trees.
---
Thats a freaking awesome idea and a great way to keep those who die early somethng to do while thier friends play. just run around as a level one ghoul tht respawns as fast as you die.
---
Hey! Oh yeah that looks cool.
---
It's careful and somewhat tedious placing of the higher foundation. I put a half wall on the lower foundation next to me so I can get the height right and snap a lower foundation in front of me. Once placed you can select it again and slowly bring the height up to line it up with the half wall. That way the walls and roofing all fits nicely.
---
Hope that makes sense.
---
PS4- it’s been good for me, and nice to also see some low levels joining in. I’ve mostly been on NW myself, but adventure has been pretty normal
---
Yea I totally meant royal jelly
---
haha i get the whole calling people cheaters and them not being a cheater.. But come on there is no way to say that guy was not hacking...
---
Probably not
---
Well i didn’t knew revolver receives rifle perk too. I thought it’s only for pipe one, not pipe revolver. 
---
And yes, if that’s true it will be patched sadly :(
---
Trial was real version i think
---
No, he just wanted to PVP. I bet he wouldn't even have checked the factory.
---
I know what umbrella terms are but it's not one, they mean different things. Codes would fall under the umbrella of cheats, exploits and glitches do not.
---
If you take the home defense perk you can build much better turrets so its not a huge deal. Ya the lvl 4 ones suck but they act as early warning. Tge lvl15 ones shotty and the mighty rocket turrets tho... Wooo. Been killed buy a bunch of those just trying to shop in Survival. 😂
---
Not ghouls. Completely different beings I believe. The scorched cake from a virus or fungus I think and Ghouls come about because of extreme radiation
---
That's heaps good
---
My theory is this happens when there's a lot happening in the world you're in. Your system tells the server you're out of armor, but the server is busy working out 16 TSE toting players dealing to a SBQ over at Fissure Prime. Meanwhile you're packing yourself because your armor isn't in your inventory or in front of you. Has happened a couple of times to me, just wait a few, but eventually either shows up, or the auto return activates and it shows up in your inventory.
---
Oh ok I remember a quest marker linked to her quest to go to the second floor on that building she's normally in which also disappeared and flavours of mayhem isn't there. 'I'll check for 'links to the past' tomorrow because I'm feeling sleepy. Is it alright if I dm u the updates tomorrow?? Thanks for trying to help
---
You can always fast travel back to Vault 76 for free. Also, you can free fast travel to anyone you’re teamed up with, or their CAMPs, and also to any friends in game. Also to any workshops you’ve claimed. 
---
With some planning ahead, you can significantly reduce your fast travel costs. For example, if a target location is closer to one of those points above than you are currently located, travel to the free point first then fast travel for caps to the final destination.  And eventually you may want to get Travel Agent (Charisma 1) at or after Level 26; 30% discount on fast travel costs.
---
Yeah
---
Yeah, sorry dude. Your options for underarmour are currently vault suit or naked. That's it
---
You got Bethesda’s attention and you DIDNT mention that we wanted 
---
•Working stoves, sinks, showers, etc like what’s in vault 51
---
•Wallpapers, freehand junk decorating, and just about everything you see in vault 51.
---
My good sir you wasted this opportunity 😔
---
I’m thinking no, would be a bit strange having two different versions of the game live, so I feel like everyone will get wastelanders regardless of their progress. But I could be wrong
---
Sure, it’s fine I know her quest confused me too and I was lost after I did her raider trials.
---
Camp can be upgraded and moved as needed right now myself have a nice spot up in the toxic valley with a junk and lead minor.
---
Its ok I made an edit on the post with some screenshots to show you what I mean.
---
That would be more of a Zombie then a Ghoul. But I agree with turning into something to keep things interesting and playing in the game that you are currently in.
---
I'm just worried the launcher's gonna bug out on me and decline that I have the full game once the trial is over even though I bought it.
---
I kniw i was saying you could use the scorcged because they infect the living akin to modern day zombies. Fallout ghouls are a mutation caused by theradiation and the fev virus if i recall correctly
---
I thought Reddit only held stuff for a week. Learned TWO new things today!
---
You're welcome!
---
If it does then reinstall i guess lol
---
It's on a virtual network in all the same physical data centers, running on shared hardware.
---
The reason issues don't affect everything is because they have data center, regional, and global redundancies. Hardware fails every day, but you never see Google, Amazon, or Office shut down because of those redundancies - pull the plug on a server, kill an entire data center, nuke an entire region, and it doesn't matter because the services just flip over to the backup location automatically.
---
You can think of it as one network, because at a physical level that's literally what it is.  All the differences are virtualized.
---
For what it's worth, I work with this stuff doing software develoment every day. I just wasn't sure if Sony was offering something similar or only doing gaming and their own servers on their network... But judging by the fact that they're entering into an agreement with Microsoft to move their game services to Azure (announced last month), I'm assuming they don't.
---
I feel like smgs need to be moved to guerilla and add couple more semi auto receiver to them. This way a semi auto smg would benefit from pistol perks giving more options.
---
And play style. +%40 damage to Non-auto rifles is *beastly* for sniper types.
---
This sounds more like a special event that could temporarily take place around Halloween.
---
Throw em off a cliff, if the fly theyre a witch
---
Biv is amazing!
---
I’m at about 900 hours so yeah I’m a fellow addict lol
---
“You’re wrong it’s broken af but I haven’t played it” 
---
Okay.
---
Sweet zombie jesus, I want this so much. Especially the crafting!
---
Haha he deleted his comments. Such mysterious. I'll let you know if what he told me works :)
---
40 scrip at the legendary wood chipper ;)
---
You mean like half the mobs in the game when they spawn?
---
I know you can see the "help me" emote on downed targets, at least those you have downed.
---
No, My points are taking away gameplay elements that existed in FO4 that made sense and gave the world some grounding. If you're the target demographic, I understand now why they changed these things. Didn't realize these things would be so above and beyond for you.
---
Here is a common cheating way right now.
---
Last week I saw group of player with very similar ID (lets say player\_1, player\_2, player\_3) fighting SBQ. 2 of the lower level( still level 100+) act like scripted (Move left. Stop. Move Right. Stop. Shoot a bullet. Repeat). This is the 3rd time I saw someone doing this kind of things in month. Repeat 3 times in the same server then switch server.
---
It is very common in East Asia server. This is the 3rd time I see someone to do it recently.  I am a trader so I can easily 'guess' which region I am in by having a huge friend list.
---
I sure hope not. There’s no way I can take down even a single scorchbeast by myself much less a damn queen.
---
Thanks! Glad it's helpful.
---
This is a common bug.
---
Happens every once in a while, really slows downs trade for many of us :/
---
Only way to fix is to relog, or switch server.
---
I know right!
---
The launcher or game?
---
It’s not broken at all. If you haven’t played it then get out.
---
It's such a simple trick and building is already glitchy and sometimes limiting, hopefully they wouldn't deny us the simple pleasure of floor corn.
---
Meh. Ain’t no thang. Ppl hate when you like a game. Hate when you don’t. Hate the truth. Hate the lies. Hehe. Such a miserable generation.
---
I actually switch between fp and tp constantly during the match depending on what the situation calls for
---
Hunting rifles are only good if you have superb aim. Unless you head-shoot targets well, you'll get nailed during your reload animation between shots. If you're not headshotting most of the time, go with a combat sniper instead.
---
*Nuke goes off as you fly away* if you happened to collect the briefcase but didn't use it
---
They turned me into a newt.... but I got better!...lol
---
Why wouldn't they? So far we're just having a sneak peek for nuclear winter so that might be why
---
"Bias." Excuse me what.
---
You realize how stupid you look right?
---
They're also useful for short term cover. I have a small easy bunker, all doorways and floors, for when I know we're going to stay where we are for a bit. Two doorways next to each other is enough to provide almost full cover to you, so it can save your life as a place to duck and stim into. That said, it \*does\* make for some wonderful schmuck bait.
---
Exactly!
---
GIVE US WORKING SINKS, showers, and toilets for our camps! Lol
---
Lmao... Yeah without pack rat perk you are pretty much an anchor in the water buddy 😅
---
It'll cost ye... just like all "special" floor options and I presume paints/wallpapers to come. I wish that not everything other than the most basic sets wasn't likely to just end up as atomic shop items.
---
Or have birdbones.
---
Build a bridge out of her!!
---
Because VATS is what makes a game an RPG and not a looter shooter.
---
Just got tracking number for mine
---
Thanks im going to do that now, I play The standard version, and ive bought many Camp items in the past with atoms, but i never touch cosmetics because power armor pain costs too much and unless its something(like the new power armor helmet) that really sticks out i have no need.
---
Yes. Better.
---
*Nuke goes off as you fly away* if you happened to pick up the briefcase but never used it
---
Since most anything can be muled between characters anyways there is no real reason not to have a shared stash or a mail system.
---
I thought the patch notes said something about spawning right next to their vendor machines (if you're teleporting to a shop base). So far I've ended up at the very far edge of several such bases, and in water far more than all the bases I've visited to this point combined :(

Armor shouldnt be a big deal till your level 50. Pretty much why you don't see anyone selling lower level stuff. On all 5 of my toons I always just used whatever I found and replaced it when it broke. Sometimes I went without pieces for a while. Also, the craftable leather armor should be enough if you can't find better. 
---
Point is, don't look to hard for a great level 30 piece of armor when in a week you'll be looking to replace it.
---
Never thought of doing that
---
Sniper here. A few tips for those who like to fight at max range instead:
---
1. Watch before you shoot: Most players will not see you at a proper sniping distance. Don't pop off as soon as you see a moving target. Wait and be patient. Check for snipers.
---
2. Take down Snipers: The biggest threat to you is other snipers. If you take them down first, the others generally must charge you to attack you.
---
3. Small moves are big moves: Side step one body length (minimum) between shots. Standing still means your target (or their buddy) can line up a head shot and down you.
---
4. Leave downed targets until all targets are down: Like OP said, downed targets are like catnip to many teams. Down a target, check for threats, and if there are none, wait a moment and check on that downed target. Odds are good that someone's going to be standing there reviving their buddy, and often they're in the open to do it.
---
5. If you don't need something, don't go for their loot. You think downed friends are catnip? You should see the rush to check duffel bags. And odds are they're going to stand still for at least a second or two while they search said bags...
---
6. Move to the edge of the circle. Stay on the outer edge. The fire protects your back, and might even disguise your movement.
---
7. Stay out of towns: Your targets are moving into them. Your targets are watching them as they move in. Don't be there.
---
8. Sit in the bushes. Bushes help break up your shape, making ti harder to spot you. Crouch down in them bushes.
---
9. Don't move. It's much, much harder to sport a player in the trees and bushes if you're not moving.
---
10. If your teammates are suicide bunnies, don't follow all that close: They won't help you if you go down, but they make wonderful bait.
---
Last game I had was a wonderful demonstration of most of these.
---
I set up on a hill near Arktos Pharma. I''m in a bush, just in front of a long stretch of clear downhill, then going into another set of light woods and then a road. A team of three move into draw range, running through the woods to one side of the road. I watch and count. Three people, one hunting rifle, one AR, one combat rifle. They're checking the town ahead, using the trees for cover... from the town, not me.
---
Took a moment, and headshot the one with the hunting rifle while they scoped out the town. Instant down. Let them be, swapped to the combat rifle. Took a couple shots, but they took cover, took a stim, and then stepped out to try and line up a shot on me. Headshot, down. Back to the first target, and there's the AR user, trying dutifully to rez their buddy, right in the open. Easy headshot.
---
Then the fucking scorchbeast showed up and shat acid on my entire mountain before I could down it.
---
Even in NW, fucking scorchbeasts.
---
I thought the partnership with microsoft was only for streaming games.
---
The purveyor has been fantastic.
---
Wow, talk about idiots/jerks.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I always leave mine open (a) because sharing is caring and (2) why fight over it. I'm not interested in pvp in adventure mode, so those open extractors will just share the wealth rather than spur on a land war in Asia.
---
Literally just realized that about 10 minutes ago.
---
They should dual-class those.
---
It doesn't have to be a lot either. And there could be a daily cap, like maybe you get 10 per win to a max of 50.
---
I have no way to mule anything
---
Don't let 1 hacker make you take a break.
---
Through a friend that is. It is just a hastle.
---
Only reason I commented like I did is that there are different circumstances and letters sent out. Some were banned some suspended. Many think it’s the same thing and it’s not. 
---
Those banned for duping are permanently gone and they can’t even play other connected Bethesda games. 
---
Suspended doesn’t mean they duped but had an item that came up on their check (most likely ammo). 
---
Now some of those I believe maybe found them and didn’t dupe but I also think some new exactly that they were duped but didn’t actually dupe. Like the one post about the players hunting duper’s down and taking their junk.
---
Why to cap rewards? Are you communist or something?
---
Millions. My main character ate nothing but dog food for 700-800 hours.
---
Ok thanks man!
---
I got caught inside the map early on in Flatwoods, and decided to just wait for someone to kill me. I lasted almost the entire time before a glowing mirelurk Hunter killed me with acid. It was the. Biggest xp I ever got from NW
---
I was wrong about this game too. I was very worried about other people ruining the experience. So far the only problem I have had with it being multiplayer is that I will often find quest areas already cleared out of enemies. All the other players have been helpful though. No trolls so far. The community seems nice.
---
Yeah. Having not played apex myself I've heard the ping system is awesome.
---
I get through a lot myself but, wow. What can I say except "Good Doggy"?
---
But 52 Player fire ring hide and seek is fun! Especially when I use photo mode to lie down and I place a mine by me
---
I've been wondering this myself. I ran it for a bit. If anything maybe it sort of fills the vats but never actually returns it to 100% seemed like I could never catch it actually working.
---
If there could be a running data page with live numbers of data somewhere, I’d LOVE it
---
As mentioned repeatedly herein, pacifist is your friend unless you want to pvp.
---
And by that I mean get omgwtfbbq'd by a bloodied build who's bored while you're talking to a vendor or anything at all.
---
And gives you the ability to perform actions whilst in the chopper. Like teabagging
---
Thanks for the help
---
That's why. I didn't want to fiddle with food so that was the most convenient way. All my friends would pick up dog food so I'd never run out.
---
The exp earn rate is quite low. A guy posted on this sub earlier that he’s level 27 after 37 hours after playing from 10Am-2Am and some other times
---
Can you buy this twice?
---
Banpocalypse
---
Anything less would be uncivilized.
---
Np. You play on ps4 right?
---
That’s why you don’t play survival during your first days in
---
So strange...I may actually take it off but I love the idea of it.
---

Werll, the datamined upcoming Charelston BR map is much, much smaller than the current Faltwoods map and could be perfect for this.
---
We have vertibots so the games engine can handle it
---
I also vastly prefer FO3 to NV, I don't much like NV to be honest.  
---
I also dislike BR games, can't stand them.  But this one feels more Fallouty then I expected.  I like it.  The timing is of course intended.  New sneak peak Durning a free weekend.  They have bills to pay after all.  
---
But, that being said, they will update where the money is.  So if BR is bringing in the atoms they will focus on that more the Adventure/survival.  I don't see that happening though, it's fun but there are a lot of BRs out there and this one is different enough to appeal to the FO base but I don't know that it is really all that appealing to the BR community.
---
So far their update schedule has been a good thing, I bet on that being the norm a bit longer.
---
Time will tell though.
---
The tunnels under the freeway!
---
If Bethesda wanted to kill adventure they wouldn’t be devoting a huge amount of resources to adding NPCs in Wastelanders. That a huge structural change to gameplay and requires a huge investment in story writing and voice acting, with doubtless a game’s worth of new quests. If NW existed in isolation you might have a point. It doesn’t, and your predictions aabout Bethesda’s motives are directly contradicted by what they are intending to roll out. They could have bailed on this game or slapped on BR and little else. That is the opposite of what they are doing. The sky is not falling.
---
You stupid fuckers need to look up what NPC means and stop saying the E3 announcement is Bethesda answering fans 5 months later.  For the simpletons out there, NPC means "Non-Playable Character" and refers to any actor in-game that you can interact with.  These include the robot vendors, Graham, Rose, the frackin Pied Piper Eyebot, etc.
---
**In short, there have been NPCs in FO76 since launch.**  It was a baseless complaint then and anybody repeating it at this point is only granting credence to that lie.  If they said that FO76 had no *human* NPCs, people would have just assumed non-human NPCs like we were given and been cool with it unless they had complaints at that point about the lore of there being no living humans on the surface.
---
what's the point in playing this game as a builder then? that's literally one of the big features advertised for this game and it is still sorely lacking. not only is the budget incredibly limiting without any indication at to what costs what there are still game breaking bugs that don't even allow connecting roof tiles to walls. i find it unacceptable. but I may have the unpopular opinion on this.
---
I'm US and got a notification today. I saw some people got notifications a couple weeks ago too, so they're likely shipping in batches.
---
At this point I wouldn't worry yet. If a couple weeks pass and you don't see anything about another batch, and don't get yours, then it'd probably be worth contacting them to follow up.
---
There's no rules in the wasteland. You're certainly not under any obligation to make killing you easy.
---
Same here. I loved it in FO4. Remember just walking into a crowded base and going from guy to guy with full vats. Definitely did not see those results in this. I may have caught it once actually fill it but most of the time it seemed like it just started the fill process, then again I was standing so it should have begun anyway...made my head hurt chasing the results lol.
---
Pretty sure the laser grates only stop humans... had that happen with ghouls before there
---
I got that from a previous interview from right before E3 with IGN where he called the launch a screw up, and including what he said in this most recent one.
---
They're already working off of false information.  There have been NPCs in FO76 since launch.  This is just another troll/blind believer beating a dead horse.
---
U sure it wasn’t on an animal?
---
Agree.. I played to Overseer 8 on a lvl 5 character, not realizing my perk loadout was the only thing I wouldn't be considered a lvl 50 character for (I can wear max armor, use max weapons, max heath and stamina).
---
I started over but haven't gotten a single gold perk card. I assume this is because Ive already gotten those levels before.
---
You can tame almost anything, anything’s smaller then death claws and mega sloth can be tamed and stay at your base. Anything bigger is befriended and won’t attack you. They will follow you but if put in your base they will act like a pet. there is perks you can get that make it so if you aim at a creature lower then your level they have a chance to become tamed
---
Yeah I do
---
Send me your GT and I’ll send people your way!
---
I'm a true fan of Fallout, since the days of Fallout 1 and I'll say... I've been enjoying the free week of 76 and plan to pick it up here soon. I can't say I'm sad to have missed the launch, but I've enjoyed what I've been playing so far, and I'm now looking forward to seeing where the game goes.
---
Oh wait, guess that just makes a regular ol' fan. Ah well, at least I'm good for some screws.
---
Haven’t played any other game since launch other than a bit of fallout 4 here and there. 900 hours in, I hated it at first, but started playing around January. I’m glad I stuck with it, I can see how much it’s grown and all the exclusive limited time stuff is well worth it. Just wish I could get my hands on those Christmas packs 😭
---
Yeah I hope for new players they have to kill the SBQ to progress. And the option for current players to join that world if they want.
---
I think they just don't want to be taken down for dropping names like other subs.
---
Have fun!!
---
I don't use a mic and I can always hear people who do. Never toyed with the settings.
---
It's true. The amount of "If this turns out to be battle royal I will..." comments were just silly.
---
Although I never expected a battle royal tbh so hadn't formed an opinion other than mild '*won't try that*' like I've done with survival.
---
Best I found is the $30 from Bethesda. I do see some cheaper versions on Kinguin but that can be hit-or-miss and they offer to charge you an extra $3 for "Buyers Insurance"... which is kind of bullcrap.
---
If I don't find anything by the end of the week I'll probably just buy it from Bethesda.
---
Yeah i came across that one aswell, it's at the lighthouse right?
---
Yeah play Adventure mode and it's impossible. You were either playing on Survival or a liar.
---
I don't do it on purpose :( Friendly animals shouldnt be impacted by Poison Aura :(
---
Yep!
---
Do the main story, grind areas that have large amounts of enemies like Whitesprings and West Tek
---
Yeah survival is open game regardless of level. Leve doesn't matter there.
---
And if in adventure. Just don't hit back or claim a workshop and you'll be fine. Players can't hurt you here unless you consent to PvP by fighting back or claiming workshop
---
Grieved how, if I may ask?
---
&gt; This is exactly how it went down, people got pissed because it wasn't top shelf AAA
---
EXACTLY, yet Bethesda pushed it and advertised it as one. That is why people were pissed about that.
---
&gt;was essentially Fallout 4 with no NPCs and an online component and just lost their shit.
---
Yup, 16x the detail! 4x the size!!!
---
&gt;It was buggy as hell, but it's mostly stable now. 
---
ROFL, no it isn't, half the player base is still unable to Arktos without CTD, the BR servers can be crashed by a single player placing their CAMP down if it is large enough. Half the challenges are still unable to be completed, things they promised months ago still aren't in the game like decorating your camps with junk and display cases. ETC ETC.
---
But good to know...thanks for sharing observations.
---
Scrap
---
Out of 1200 hours or so, I looked at them when I was level 10, but never wanted to part with my caps. That would be a great idea though, or pay with Silver/Gold scrap, put all extractors to use
---
johny, you mean me or primetime?
---
I'm guessing they'd specialize in guerrilla warfare, sabotage and infiltration
---
I forgot those even existed. I'm probably carrying around 15. I tend to just find them in my inventory.
---
Flatwoods would probably be decent to grind early on aswell.
---
You can exit the game the start menu
---
The no npcs the first year makes 1000% sense when you look at the story. I always figured they’d add them once I learned the story, it was perfectly set up for them to return.
---
Have to give it to the devs though, they are pretty good at giving up on zombie games.
---
We are! I started a new character alongside him and I've been guiding him around the forest. He's in love with the world lol
---
Probably doesn't care if it's free this week.
---
Your fault.
---
People are not playing it for xp though. People play it for fun and excitement! Sure, some hide, but that is their fun, but most don't. There is no need to fix what is not broken.
---
Never noticed that. Ive got the lone wanderer perk, so ive been dodging teams for the most part. Time to make friends i guess :S
---
Yeah but.  He's hacking and public shaming has it's place in society.
---
The Mistress of Mystery quest is the best one in the game IMO.  The Sheepsquatch quest is good too.
---
I like playing with a team but I've had my most successful runs solo. Find a big gun and a good lurking spot, then wait for visitors. Made it to the final teams twice last night and got great xp.
---
Cough cough* Port over do it yourshelf mod bethesda cough cough*
---
Two guys in power armor started demanding that I fight, beat me to death and stole all of my stuff.
---
Also make signs an item you enter text, not indiviual pieces.
---
Just take it easy pick your perk cards that best fit your Play style scrap weapons for various attachments and pick up that junk and scrap for building materials and only pick up anmo you need as in this game ammo has weight to it
---
Preach. I bought the power armor edition, and i did it for, drum roll please....
---
🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁
---
The power armor helmet. Which is badass and looks cool as shit on my shelf. I didn't even realize something was "wrong" with the bag at first. The only reason this even became an issue to begin with was that it gave people justification to be pissed at Bethesda. But nobody, i mean just about NOBODY gave half a fuck about the bags until haters realized the advertised material was wrong.
---
I was caught in the middle of the road just standing there, I figured surely someone would see me and kill me fairly quickly. Maybe I was actually under the map though, who knows. The point was is that just being alive is a fairly decent way to progress, which isn't necessarily a good thing.
---
You wanna play together?
---
I think so. It makes zero since to play the original main quest how you do with NPC around. Unless they conpletely rework it, which i think takes too much of the experience away. I think it'll be server separated, OG main/New Main.
---
You can't sell ammo to any vendors but you can sell them through your vending machine. Fusion cores can sell for a few caps but set all other to 1 cap.
---
But when it comes to early game ammo like 38, 308, or 10mm, nobody buys that; we all have a surplus. I just give it away to new players of which there are many now. I've just been stopping by the overseer's camp and dropping off all that ammo as well as chems and stuff in her tote and the toolbox.
---
Wearing excavator pa you can farm lead ore at lucky hole mine. Craft gunpowder with acid from hemlock holes, farm west tek for steel or theres iron ore deposits little ways southeast of top of the world. Craft your own ammo so youre not bothered by anyone.
---
Was asking because I believe this may be an issue only for PS4 players
---
Gt Tanaas
---
Pretty much how it is in any BR. Playing it safe easily gets you top 5
---
That's awesome. I'm so glad to see so many new players there are this week. One of you should set up camp near Lucky Hole Mine and the other should set up camp in the Toxic Valley by Hemlock Holes and the two of you could make a killing selling ammo.
---
I would like this, that way I could add the stuff I bought from the Atom Shop to my camp.
---
Yeah, we are a friendly bunch 😁
---
Happens occasionally. Give them some credit though, they went through that whole dmv ordeal just to try and murder you.
---
Thanks for the advice! I was all over the place with my skill points and now I'm lvl 45 and struggling like mad. Probably keep the character and start a new one.
---
Read the updates. Log in and see for yourself.
---
The laser grates were already off after I took it up. I was just blown away that they were on the floor below me and somehow not only managed to get themselves into the elevator but also apparently press the appropriate button to come up to where I was.
---
Need a free body guard
---
He also travels around, like the other Mothmen.
---
Go to adventure mode first. Sounds like you went straight to survival.
---
scrap for scrip
---
If you're in adventure mode, make sure to set yourself into pacifist mode. That will prevent a LOT of hassle
---
I normally don't, actually! But I freaking *love* maps and geography, especially in video games, and I wanted to see if I could find the texture for the map you see during Nuclear Winter, and find out if it was the full map or just that region. And in the process I found those other maps.
---
It says outfits. You bought an underarmor. Cry me a river.
---
Oh word, I was in the menu and started getting hit be a guy in power armor as his friend stood in the doorway. When I came out of the menu I punched at one of them in reaction and tried to run. I didn’t realize if I didn’t attack them I couldn’t get hurt
---
Not all witches float though, my sister in law sure as hell doesn't.
---
You can get really good Overseer xp just for surviving and making it into the last 10 alive, more than you receive for just going Rambo and killing a few players before dying. Work on your hide-and-seek game and you'll level up fast enough.
---
There probably will be. This is just a sneak peak. I do wonder what the reward will be though.
---
Info is a little sketchy, and the wording is ambiguous, but it reads as game services, content-streaming services, plus some hardware and AI tech sharing:  https://news.microsoft.com/2019/05/16/sony-and-microsoft-to-explore-strategic-partnership/
---
With the statement of "gaming and content-streaming", if they meant game-streaming and content-streaming, the grammar is usually "game- and content-streaming" (the hanging hyphen on game indicating multiple hyphenated items have the same ending part). 
---
Either way, the fact that the two are teaming up, and using Microsoft's servers for the server bits, and Sony's hardware for the hardware bits, indicates that both companies clearly understand each other's strengths.
---
Server hop at tanagra town. 1/3 times it's a giant sloth that drops screws, 1/3 times it's a deathclaw that drops gears, 1/3 times it's a fog crawler. You can also run to toxic waste dump just a few steps north to kill 2-3 deathclaws.
---
so much. rite now is the sneak peek of nuclear winter battle royale mode. I'd give that a try. its alot of fun. survival mode is dumb. but in adventure their is a bunch to do. learn about and hunt down an imposter sheepsquatxh. fight a real sheepsquatch. join the scouts and get a backpack.  go into the burrows under harpers ferry. go underneath arktos pharma and fight a lvl 100 alpha predator. their is so much added and more to come in the next few weeks.
---
Well guess what? You don’t know what they’re going to do either. So stop acting like you know anything huh? “You are never getting un banned” your opinions are not facts brah, please stop the full stops after every few words also It. Is . Incorrect. Grammar. And. Annoying.🤙🏼
---
Oh lol feelsbad
---
Brotherhood storyline!
---
I feel like if its obvious cheating (instant death upon render or incredibly fast aim bot) then these people should be shamed. Moderators on Reddit should make a judgement call if the person is actually cheating or not. If they believe them to be cheating the post should remain if they don't believe it to be cheating the post should be deleted. Bethesda is notoriously slow when it comes to banning players, we as a community should know to avoid these players. Unfortunately for our own sake as players.
---
Second take.... let Cannibal players harvest strange meat from corpses that they can consume raw  (but take 15 rads) or consume cooked (and take 5 rads).
---
How would I go about joining the scouts? A backpack sounds pretty appealing
---
I'm level 32! What's your psn
---
Not much since the mods are the important part and most other armor is easy to find
---
It shouldnt have to take a whole server to kill somebody! Do you not know what the concept of server balance is?
---
hmu is you nuke
---
Hahaha I’m just imagining a wendigo registering for an ID and waiting for its number to be called.
---
 Op better? 😅
---
Yeah seen it consistent I do farm the fort and any ghouls you miss have a tendency to follow you up
---
it shouldn't strong enough to kill them super quickly unless you have 1000 diseases.
---
There was the vault DLC in FO4. We participated in those tests. We could even use the test items afterwards, from memory. Like the bike.
---
This is a first in 76 though.
---
No way! I kill Brahmin when people sell non legendary weapons at their camp, then transfer the you've been insulted note to the dead Brahmins inventory
---
Ok then equal efficiency but you have to chase and shoot or melee the plants first.
---
Even if it's one bullet per dollar, that'd still be worth it to me. :)
---
I mean you are the one who said it. You just called yourself a dumb ass lmao
---
How is the game so different from fallout 4 though? All it is is the fallout 4 engine with a few other players and stripped out systems. That's it? That sounds more like people were hating on it because its just a repackaged stripped out fallout 4 than because its so wildly different? 
---
Wheres your proof most people who have issues with the game just voiced that to "look cool" because it's still 2005??
---
I just gave some fresh out of the vault noob almost all my .5p ammo cause dropping ammo takes so long! They also got a new level 1 .50 hunting rifle with recon scope and suppressor, and two heavy leather armor pieces. :)
---
No. Just no. It is not wrong at all to destroy someons stuff and take the workshop. It's a gameplay feature, a public resource, meant to be fought over. To advantage you. Don't try to shame for playing the game.
---
Wasn't it the institute? I must be remember8ng wrong.
---
It's been requested many times and I fully agree :)
---
Trolls gonna troll I suppose.
---
Yeah it's a NW reward, level 8 I believe.
---
This is really lovely to hear. As a mum who experiences the same time challenges (and also spends a lot of time at work!) it's cool to hear the community feels the same way I do. I'll make sure this gets passed on to the team!
---
This subject is getting almost as bad as "Is Fallout 76 worth buying/coming back to?"

Got any well trusted RL buddies than can log in and check for nice stuff for you?

I did that when I had to go away over easter and didn't wanted to miss any eggs. When i came back my camp budget was filled up with rabbit plushies carefully hidden everywhere. Fun and annoying, but I never missed an egg.
---
So you're a bored internet nerd?
---
Ok, the small foundation with a large second floor is a legitimate way to have a big moveable base?
---
Yea but ask the guy from vault 69 if he agrees.
---
Welcome!! Please dont feed the griefers....thank you
---
These are cool tips! Thanks for sharing. Number 2 is my go-to strategy haha.
---
Dude wouldn’t bother making a new account character, they’ll unban eventually. I got an email a month ago saying “we are still working towards a safe way to re instate the characters without issue. But be assured it is being worked on and you will be updated via email as soon as a fix is live and confirmed.”
---
Except it is??? That's how shit gets changed and for the better?? Are you new to how humanity works?
---
i finally got this quest out of my log, i recommend tagging what you need in search and coming back to it
---
Nah.  As someone who sucks at multiplayer,  this will turn me off the game mode as it will turn everyone into a try hard.
---
HE DIDN'T GRIEF. You are meant to fight over workshops! Griefing is totally different.
---
As someone who enjoys 76, it was absolutely deserving of the harsh criticism it got at launch. Automatic weapons slowed framerates to a crawl, enemies would constantly become invincible, the game would crash at least twice in a play session, enemies from far higher level pools and areas would spawn in places like flatwoods, PVP was always on and even if you didn't want to participate the other players could deal chip damage to you and kill you relatively quickly, scorchbeast queen didn't drop loot at all sometimes, camps would break for absolutely no reason. 76 had a very, very rough launch.
---
 This is the post about my process I was talking about in the updated original post. As I said before **DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS UNLESS IT IS SUGGESTED TO YOU BY ONE OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES OR TECHS.**

I'm just sharing this because I could not find such information when my problem first began so hopefully someone else who ends up in this situation might be able to get it solved faster with this information or atleast know they are not the only one to experience it.

=============&gt; \*\*\*PORT FORWARDING PROCESS and CONNECTIVITY SOLUTION BELOW\*\*\* &lt;===============  
---
To be on the safe side I did a little research on what I would need to do to Open/Forward a port so that I did not cause an issues or damage to my router or network. I was told that I need to set up a static IP before doing the forwarding so I did that first and than the port forwarding process. After the ports were forwarded I did a few router and console resets and finally a few login tests.  
---
=====&gt; Setting up the static IP  
---
I followed the instructions in this Youtube video ([**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVInhZWK\_pQ)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVInhZWK_pQ)) to set up a static IP on my console.  
---
I pressed the Xbox symbol on the center of my controller and went to the "System" Tab &gt; "Settings" &gt; "Network" &gt; "Network Settings" &gt; "Advanced Settings"   
---
I took a picture of all of the info on this page. This is the info I used to set up my static IP address.   
---
I selected "IP Settings" &gt; "Manual"   
---
I entered the IPv4 Address that was on the page I took a picture of, the Subnet mask that was in that picture, the Gateway that was in the picture, and the primary DNS. I did not have any secondary DNS info in the picture so I left that option empty.  
---
When all of this was finished It said I was connected to the internet.  
---
=====&gt; Forwarding The Ports  
---
To access my router I followed the steps on the following page ([**https://portforward.com/spectrum/rac2v1k/)**](https://portforward.com/spectrum/rac2v1k/)) for forwarding spectrum routers and I also checked the user manual for routers just to make sure I was inputing everything correctly ([**https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/modems-routers-wireless-adapters/)**](https://www.spectrum.net/support/internet/modems-routers-wireless-adapters/)).  
---
I looked on the back of my Router for the "Router Login". I entered this info into my search bar on my computer. I entered the Login and password provided on the back of the router on the "Spectrum Router login screen". From here I went into "Advanced" (Tab) &gt; "Network" (Drop down menu) &gt; "WAN" &gt; "Port Forwarding" &gt; "Add".  
---
From here I input most of the information ya'll provided me in the previous message about opening ports. For the first port I forwarded I input the following information:  
---
For "Services" --- I entered "Fallout 76".   
---
For the "Public IP" --- I was unable to adjust it so I left it alone.  
---
For the "Port Range" --- I entered "80".  
---
For "Local IP" --- I entered the IP address listed on the advanced settings page when I set up the static IP. (IPv4 address that was in the picture).  
---
For "Local Port" --- I entered the "Port" that was listed at the bottom of the picture of the advanced settings page when I set up the static IP.  
---
For "Protocol" --- I chose the protocol that was listed next to the port in your previous message ("TCP" in this case).  
---
For "Status" --- I had it set to "On".  
---
After all of this was entered I hit "Confirm" and than "Apply". I repeated the steps for each port that was listed in the previous message, changing only the "Port Range" and "Protocol" as needed. All of the other information was the same for each port.  
---
\*The router would kick me back to the login screen every few minutes so I had to input the information and apply it at a decent pace to in sure everything was applied.  
---
\*\*I was unable to input "3000-3010" as a port range (the seperating character had to be a "." and that did not work either) so I just manually input all 11 of those ports (3000, 3001, 3002,3003...3010) following the steps above. In the end this totaled out to "13" ports opened with the "Fallout 76" service name.
---
No, It's reviving a downed player. Though we can do both.
---
I mean, it’s an open world game where you can be who you want to be. Coincidentally being an asshole is a profession
---
Yup. If you're on PS4, add xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero) as a friend and you're welcome to visit my camp to see an example. Could also team up and go to a workshop cuz it'll let you build with other people... I think that's an easier way to understand it. I spent many hours doing it in FO 4 and \*still\* find the interface confusing sometimes.
---
Yup, definitely agree. Lots of posts on this.
---
This one gained a lot of traction: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzaabb/make\_vault\_51\_accessible\_in\_adventuresurvival/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzaabb/make_vault_51_accessible_in_adventuresurvival/)

I posted this one before but no one noticed it LOL: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz7exc/vault\_51\_staging\_area/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz7exc/vault_51_staging_area/)
---
Same. Let others rush in and take em out, I’m happy to pick through the wreckage :)
---
Lmao at this. The high level guy had every right to try to claim it. You don't know what he needed.
---
STOP POSTING ABOUT YOUR DAMN BAGS FFS
---
Not gonna day where but I’m almost certain you’ve been close to the second tape already. (I didn’t find it for months, myself)
---
Lock picking level is 3. Guess that’s not it either.
---
I love dropping spare Power Armor Chassis (with no pieces though) at the front door. So, if it had pieces it probably wasn’t me. 
---
What else am I gonna do? Scrap them for... nothing?
---
Kscrizz. I’m usually on.
---
Good point my flat mate could do it :)
---
Same here, they were locked, until they weren’t.
---
PC
---
Thank you
---
Something generally has to make some kind of sense to really have staying-power.... or so I thought.
---
Yeah it broke, won 2 matches today.
---
You lost me at 2.
---
Power armor is horribly under powered.
---
I think blueprints work across CAMP, workshops &amp; NW, no?
---
If so, just compartmentalize as much as possible. Make a shop blueprint, house, generator room, etc.
---
Does for me, even with only 1 disease. Turns them instantly red if I walk anywhere near them and within a few seconds they just fall over dead :/
---
System?
---
Think about it. They can’t just take items we earned from progression away so yes, progression will most likely stay.
---
&gt;power armor is far too strong
---
I stopped reading here.
---
Except that you didn’t because you couldn’t kill level 5 or lower cause pvp doesn’t start until then. Beta included. 
---
Source: played beta. Pretty explanatory.
---
I didnt realize it made a difference, Its still an outfit what benefit do you have in being a dick?
---
Its a pointless question. Because I feel like it. See?
---
Yeah, sadly griefers do exist. Unfortunately everyones reaction is to fight back and defend themselves without realizing that's exactly what you shouldn't do(adventure mode anyway). If you ignore them eventually they move on. Worst case you block them, log off and back on and you will be loaded into a new world without them.
---
Ofcourse this doesn't apply if you claim a workshop. Just claiming it is enough. They can contest it and kill you, regardless whether you fight back or not.
---
I think OP is offering a tip, not asking for them.
---
Alright I can be on tomorrow but for now I'm done
---
Sounds like something a total jackass would say. It's not even like, a good or classic saying.
---
Also, fuck em, like what you want to like their opinions don't carry shit for weight.
---
Yes, I know.
---
What a lovely opinion.
---
Hard. Means any game joined has potential for rotten game ruining piles of crap.
---
It happened with COD. And it was so very tragic.
---
I'll be back its just massively disheartening to legit players
---
To make it a realistic suggestion lol it is there paid currency after all...
---
In my own opinion, the game is very much what you make it.   
---
Until human NPC's get added, it'll be a lot of the same throughout your journey. If you don't care about anything thus far, you're likely not going to care much about the rest. I personally didn't mind the lore too much. If you dislike it though, you might want to find other activities to do rather than worrying too much about that. Leveling, grinding out materials, crafting, etc.  
---
I liked it, myself but understand it might simply not be your cup of tea.
---
Honestly this game is underrated at times
---
You mean that vendor camp I visited that had almost 2000 serums and 100K ultracite 5.56 ammo for sale was a duper?
---
because bethesda committed consumer fraud
---
Yes they are... atleast on xbox I know they are
---
While this might be true, not everyone is as informed as you. Dont be a dick and explain to them so they know better the next time.
---
Big Bend Tunnel
---
I haven't hopped in yet, but do the weapon skins transfer in to survival?
---
It's a slow build, it picks up the story progresses. Can understand though if its not your cup of tea.
---
The incentive to kill people is that it’s the most effective way to loot as long as you’re good at shooting.
---
Thank you.   I am new to this game.  Dude randomly gave it to me cause he knows I'm gaming again.  I love the concept, but I do find it confusing to play.   I don't understand what is going on with the suits and the mods.  The tutorial videos I find are geared for more experienced fallout players.  I will be on tomorrow to figure my base out and I'll definitely friend you.
---
There's lots to do other than the main quests. Go read the posters at any train station to start the Wild Appalachia content.
---
Substantially better, I would definitely get back on!
---
It's just the airport, the watoga station lighting, and the exterior of vault 51.  Not many other changes.
---
I don't have that one or the stone benches plan (rare grahm plan). Only 2 I'm missing. Not sure if it's out, haven't ran a search on the forum either.
---
Delete what?
---
Toy trucks and cars. Desk fans and typewriters the paper offices and sugar grove.
---
Google "nukacrypt".  They always have the current codes listed.
---
I would say game but im ps4. Dont know how that works
---
Here's a biggie: In "One Violent Night," DO NOT play the instruments to lure the boss faster. People use the endless waves of ghouls to grind for Legendaries, and you will REALLY piss them off if you hasten the end of the event!
---
Wait until there are five minutes or so left on the timer, THEN start making a racket.
---
Oh my goodness thx so much
---
i hope everyone sees that these posts are literally just ads
---
You said “this subject is almost as bad as...” and added links so I figured you were throwing shade at OP for doing the same thing those other posters did.
---
By most accounts the plot's not that strong right now, but the atmosphere is slowly building. It was a horrible start filled with bugs and instabilities; but that gave a lot of time for feedback and for the players to express what they want with this game, and it may be that the next few months are part of a slow reveal of some decent storyline. It's a worthwhile game as an immersive atmosphere, especially if you want to fight radzombies while armed with a giant candycane and gun that shoots snowballs while dressed in a sheepsquatch mascot outfit
---
Play adventure mode, people are nicer there.
---
If we get a flossing dance in FO76, I will be selling off all of my gear for 0 caps.
---
It is the pre-beta.. hopefully in time as long as people keep bring it up we may get lucky
---
Server hopping just worked for me too! Thanks!
---
Workshops are kind of a waste of time.   
---
Scavenge, scavenge, scavenge. You can roam through buildings and loot it of everything you need for screws and such, then rinse and repeat. Get more doing that regularly than you'll ever get trying to control a workshop.
---
Minor bugs?  Surely you are joking.  I’ve not given up
---
Tanagra Town might be a little dangerous for a player who doesn't even have his excavator armor yet.
---
Maybe you guys are higher level with better weapons. I’m not arguing that power level should be on par with regular players armor. But there shouldn’t be any cases where it’s literally unstoppable as I experienced.
---
And make AP infinite it’s so annoying in nw
---
Free trials or switches to f2p make modders, hackers and cheaters pour into a game. It's just so low risk, because if you're banned you can just make a new account and start again. A massive surge in cheaters has pretty much happened in every game that lets them in and they always find new ways to cheat faster then the devs can stop them.
---
What do you mean? All you gotta do is install bethesda launcher and press download.
---
It doesn't have to specifically be "Infection" - you can just say there's a group of survivors trying to hold out against an oncoming Ghoul horde and the dead players just become Ghouls for gameplay purposes but the survivor they used to be isn't actually infected or anything.
---
Kill all the things. You will emmet more xp killing than through questing. Events are the way to level quickly. Especially if you stick up on stew from Mama Dolce's.
---
On Xbox?
---
Ah
---
This.  Also, fast travel to events and do them. Good xp and rewards as well as you make back your travel cost in caps most of the time (as long as you aren't fast traveling from one corner of the map to the opposite each time)
---
You
---
But there are more then enough perks and weapons to make any non PA build more value then a PA build. It should feel like and act like a walking tank not a walking smart car.
---
I completely agree that perception outside of rifles is basically useless... night eyes, night person... wtf...
---
Also Shroud is a Fallout fan. He wasn’t playing for advertisers or views. He was playing bc he was genuinely exited
---
I can help. MoonlightCowboy, I'm on right now for a little bit. HMU
---
Yes
---
Yup unfortunately. Hopfillt back up. In a week or two
---
Nah they should make it the entire map
---
No, that was not my intention.  I just...typed kinda sloppily and in haste without being verbose enough.  I can see how I could've given that impression.
---
Honestly it wouldn't surprise me.
---
I had to use the playstation store in the internet to get the free demo option and install from my purchased games on my playstation. It may be the same for Xbox?
---
Fair enough. It can happen.
---
Idk, I feel like that would be way too much walking and running.
---
Happened to me around 12 30 ish
---
PS were bein dicks about it.
---
There's a place on the southeast side of the white springs golf course, a bit north of a fissure. You can farm junk there and collect a variety of raw materials, including screws and gears. Lots of interesting things spawn nearby as well.
---
I was just thinking about this exact thing. If I got into the game now. Then I'd only have x number of months to fully explore "vanilla 76". 
---
I would hit this same conundrum on Warcraft. It feels like you get left behind when you want to take a break for a few months. Then it takes forever to catch up because no one is doing the old content anymore. And you can't group up with higher level people because of all the restrictions. It just snowballs from there.
---
Agreed. Also, if the player who owns the tamed creature/Brahmin is in pacifist mode, neither should be able to be damaged by other players, just like their CAMP.
---
Sony is kinda beinge reluctant about cross play with console. There are only like 3 games I know of that have ps4 and xbox cross play. Many other games have pc to Xbox or pc to ps4 cross play available, but sony doesn't want to have cross play with many xbox games. I think todd howard at one point said sony wasnt being very helpful in the process.
---
&gt; My shop desperately needs a Mr. Handy.
---
That’s a funny way to spell sentry bots.
---
you just need to know where to look. the capital building and vault tec university are good places to gather those items.
---
Agreed. It really, really sucks to make it all the way to the last 2 teams standing, die and have the other teammates get SO MUCH MORE xp for winning even though you all came in 1st. This has happened so many times...
---
Nah 4 times the size of fallout 4 is perfect for 52 people to have constant interactions
---
I’d be good with having different camp stashes having separate contents, sort of like vending machines. 
---
In FO4, I kept weapons in a footlocker (before displays were added), clothing in a dresser, etc.  Would love to be able to do the same thing in FO76.
---
They are dicks about everything dude
---
I actually didn’t know the brotherhood had a storyline in 76. What level should I be to do that quest?
---
Yeah so in the early days, every vendor faction had 200 caps and could only be found in specific regions on map....
---
A few months back they they added a vendor bot of every faction to the whitesprings resort to make it easier. So no you don't have to travel around the map and can find everything in one location. They also combined all factions into 1400 cap pool between all vendors.
---
Tankier than non PA players yes. But there shouldn’t any instances where you can literally out heal damage. I suspect my troubles are more level based, which is still not good. It was blocking easily more than 80% of my damage (60 damage weapon showing like 7 damage) There’s no world where that specific instance in pvp is balanced or fair. Especially when he’s only gotta hit me in return once or twice. PvP should ALWAYS be simple. You shoot them before they shoot you and you shoot them more than they shoot you. If they’re just standing there stimming while laughing at the strongest weapon I have. We’ve got a problem.
---
Bethesda wanted to but Sony didn't as far as I know.
---
What an idiot. People can spectate you, and you’re this careless while clearly using exploits. Banned for sure
---
Oh cool. Where do I go to trigger those quests?
---
Poses for pictures &gt; emotes and dances
---
Truth.
---
Perhaps having it be within a certain timeframe? 5 minutes, or until it comes up with the 'Final Teams Remaining' thing.
---
STAY AWAY FROM MY BALLS 🏀
---
When you look at the page is there no select option? Or if you scroll down to look at the more into part, does "install: x" pop up in the upper right corner?
---
It would be fun but they would have to make it like 80 players and make the times in between storms way longer
---
It shouldn't take a whole server to kill one guy dude wtf? Do you not know what the concept of balance is or are you just not wanting to see it
---
Agreed. IronZur is a really good composer. Bethesda is really lucky to have this guy work for them.
---
Oh right, Xbone.  No such luck though, I’m afraid.  I’ve grounded it with posts and stairs to both foundations and floor pieces, and nothing frees them up.  If I could get a foundation block up there to directly touch the bottom of the mesh stairs, it might work, since I think that’s all they’re naturally meant to connect to, but I don’t know of a way to do that (especially in a way that isn’t the sort of glitchy exploitation that got me into this situation).
---
I've experienced this several times when it hasn't even been a legendary vendor or a vendor with unique items. Just some random train station and a person who doesn't wanna spend a few caps to go to one of the many nearby unoccupied vendors. One of the times I'd just walked up and initiated trade so it wasn't like they'd been waiting for any significant period of time.
---
What's up at the moment is just a demo.
---
I'm surprised that it isn't. But this is still just the testing phase of it, not the full release. They've been taking our suggestions to heart a lot lately regarding this gametype.
---
Maybe it’s a duck?
---
Spend some time on the hog farm. You will figure it out. Lol.
---
No. Your earned xp is yours
---
Heads Up to x.. Henny.. x fir all the great stuff.!
---
The discs are coded but if you’re playing on the same machine anyway it should be fine
---
I'd recommend storing your junk more often.
---
Really? I would think the 90% weight reduction alone would make it desirable.
---
Become a merchant.
---
Mistress of mystery is awesome. Run around the dried out lakebed on the east side and you’ll run across some stuff ;)

Nope

IGN Sgt\_OKeefe. I can ride shotgun with you. I'm lvl 240 so firepower won't be a problem.
---
On the porch of a house on the high street of Flatwoods is a body that has the second Colonel tape. Definitely give it a listen.
---
The engine was never designed for online mutiplayer, much less cross-platform multiplayer.  
---
It's kinda amazing they pulled **this** off to be honest.
---
People are cunts.
---
Probably more of the same.  This game is pretty reliant on the player being self-directed.  That's just how it is.  It's not going to take you by the hand and lead you on an epic adventure.  It is what you make of it.
---
I’ve been playing NW during the trial and not understanding why my special is rising!  
---
Look to Reddit and find this shit!
---
Fucking BOOOOOOOO.
---
I've had them show up, but I assumed they just spawned or glitched in. Did you actually see them come out of the elevator?
---
I don't think "Forgotten" is the right term
---
Never.
---
I always liked the game.
---
&gt;  It kinda screws with the plot of the game if you come out of the vault and theres human npcs all over the place
---
Fallout. Fallout 3. Fallout 4. All games where you come out of the vault and there are humans and settlements. It's obvious in 76 that the Responders were active while the vault was sealed, and that the entrance was being watched by other less savory folk. Had the Responders and company not been wiped out/forced from Appalachia, or had the vault opened earlier, there would have been people (human NPCs) all over the place. 
---
&gt;I *wouldn't* say *they're* shit out of luck, they can start a new character to play with *their* weak ass friend.
---
That doesn't sound like fun at all.
---
Of what?
---
I figured I just needed to know where to look, that’s why I felt a bit lazy. Is buying them in bulk worth doing? I really don’t know what else to spend caps on tbh.
---
I quit giving a shit what others thought a long time ago, so yeah, fuck em
---
Im on in 10 mins join my server i have a base near some water... Maybe bring couple of landmies? I think i got a few.

Yea the thing weighs 1 pound it’s less than my melee weapon 😂

MoM:  In the southwest of Charleston, you’re likely to have come across the AVR Medical Center during Fallout 76’s main quest. In the alleyway on the northern side of the main door, you’ll find the body of a “young woman” wearing a tattered dress and carrying some old-world cash.
---
Sheepsquatch:  Reading the Sheepsquatch poster at a train station.  Be warned, though - the final part of that quest is one of the hardest things in the game.  You'll need help.
---
I'm xbox one as well. Dm me your gt and I'll take a look later if you're on
---
They’ve been disabled internally according to the community manager
---
I agree. I’m excited to continue exploring it
---
Have you tried \*deeply breathes in\* simply walking away before it kills them?
---
They're cheaper now, but still kind of useless depending on the workshop. They're good to farm plans with, and a few have special machines.
---
Was about to post this earlier today. Only I’m on pc wanting to play with my Xbox friends. That would be greaaaaat
---
Atom cash and plans, mostly.  Though some do offer a good supply of acid to those of us that need to make 10000 rounds of ammo every few days.
---
They are good for farming materials if you need them.. the ammo factory especially.. you have to defend it about once an hour but if u keep it moving you pull in alot of ammo, lead, silver,oil and I think steel and or aluminum.. so of you are trying to farm and you have a few hours to be on, and the server dont screw you over they are great
---
Fallout 4 was originally designed to be Multiplayer but the map wasn't big enough, so the up the map sized and just used the same thing from fallout 4
---
Are you familiar with how poison works?
---
Figures, I just moved three points so I could level the Grim Reap Sprint perk... good grief.
---
I killed 12 people in one game once, crazy shit
---
Yes, it is.
---
Unfortunate. Hope it fixes soon
---
i have a problem with picking up everything. 
---
With the cannibal perk, i never need food but still pick up everything.
---
I used to think pack-rat was a useful perk, until i realized true hiker reduces so much weight in food.
---
As long as I have a power armor frame, I can still make it to a train station to trade in my items.
---
I think the final teams remaining option would work well for this!
---
See after reading this I feel like I'm doing something wrong somewhere or something
---
Tried at American peak times &amp; its even worse, can wait over 20 minutes for a match :(
---
Hopefully more resources put into it on final launch
---
Hell yea. I’m off for the night but I’ll be back on tomorrow.
---
I built a compound... 3 buildings 1 giant tent.
---
It's only the airport, it was changed a bit ago.
---
I'd imagine they'd charge pre-war prices though. 
---
Remember, in the fallout universe inflation was crazy high pre-war. Magazines like scout's life were $30+ when the real world equivalents are maybe $5-$6.
---
So charging like two or three dollars a bullet would make perfect sense.
---
I'll do a massive loot run for a few hours and see what happens I'll report back later I just got done work
---
$30? I saw $70. Is this a regional thing?
---
Sadly everytime I tried to kill someone they put all their junk in there stash, I was desperate.
---
Nah, probably not, those numbers aren't THAT crazy, especially if they have been playing since BETA.
---
You can go above level 5 in the beta, if not it was pretty early for the games release.
---
That’s a no.  Ha.
---
You’re better than me. I’m constantly the dude in power armor getting offed in one shot by a pipe pistol.
---
Can you explain why you would normally down vote this?
---
Tesla coil for wireless power like Tesla was trying to do back in the day.
---
Oh I had no idea. I never even used water a industrial before. Completely new territory to me.
---
One thing to consider, especially since a lot of newbs will make this mistake, is to keep an eye on Gorge Junkyard this week.  If you see that it's owned by a low-level, maybe keep an eye on things from time to time.
---
Nope, i only had two neons, welcome home sign a d kill laugh love, scrapped and still nothing. I don't even have signs and letters plan
---
Upvote , upvote , upvote! Let's get that Bethesda reply!
---
Sometimes just being there to revive down team mates is more useful :) 
---
I'm not very good either
---
That just sounds like multiboxing, that isn't against bethesda's ToS. They actually have multiboxing built right into the game letting you open up multiple instances of the game on the same computer.
---
You said exactly what I’ve been saying since launch in a more informative way.
---
I see you haven't played much.
---
Possibly. I mean they wouldn't trust that many people and would most likely fortify any city to absurd limits. Example Harpers
---
(Has Left 4 Dead Flash Back) GET TO THE CHOPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
---
That's not how this works. Fallout 4 was intended to have a multiplayer mode but it wasnt developed beyond much of really anything. Fallout 76 took Fallout 4s base and added multiplayer to it. 4 didn't have a single thing in it to do multiplayer.
---
Anyway the issue isn't the engine or resources. Its Sony and Microsoft wanting/not wanting different things. Crossplay isn't so much an engine feature.
---
So false advertising is okay then? That's fine with you? And how Bethesda handled it? So if you go buy a car tomorrow and instead of a nice new 2019 Honda you get a beat up 2002 one with 400km on it, you're okay with that? That's not a "big deal" to you apparently? Companies should totally be able to market and advertise one thing and then ship a different and lesser quality product without even informing the customer or compensating them? That's okay is it? 
---
I don't think you quite understand how the world works here my young friend. It doesn't matter that you personally only bought the collectors edition for the armour. The indisputable fact is some of the money you paid went towards the bag. The bag you received was not the bag that your money was supposed to go towards. It doesn't matter that you don't care. It doesn't matter what you think because that is objectively indisputably false advertising and that's not okay. And how Bethesda handled it makes it even worse. 
---
Exactly what does looking for fuel for the "outrage fire" do? I've never understood this stupid idea that people complaining about legitimate issues are just doing it "just because" as seems to be the only reasoning crazed people such as yourself can give. 
---
Also can you please provide proof that you speak for "most of the people who bought the collectors edition" please? Because if you can't thats just you making baseless assumptions 😉
---
You're entirely right, had the vault opened sooner there would have been NPCs, but it didnt. It opened after they were all dead and 76 was the last hope. And again your right, all the aforementioned fallouts had NPCs, but none of them had a quest line where the oversear went wandering around wondering where all the people went... for a game with supposedly not enough content it is it really that much work to play to the point of npcs returning to west virgina rather then just have them be there creating a  plot hole? Not being willing to play to that point is just lazy. From that standpoint, why cant you have liberty prime as a follower as soon as you leave the vault? The most destructive character in the game is given a measly two minutes at the end of the game blah blah. I enjoy disagreeing with you. Thank you for the disscussion.
---
What about a Cazador nest?  I don't want it to be too fast or survivable.
---
How much was the Ultracite ammo?
---
Every day I go into 76 and scavenge items and sell them to the vendors in whitespring and take the 1,400 caps. I have over 17,000 caps now. I have being getting caps from containers and super mutants as well. And events are a good way to earn caps and other stuff like junk and plans.
---
Ain’t witch huntin’ if ya already found the witch.
---
Lol, "good person" my ass. Your history shows you defending Nazis and saying that you feel people are more likely to be targeted because they're white. "People target me." If everywhere smells like shit, check the inside of your nose. What a scumbag.
---
I also find that one of 76's appeals is that it's kind of therapeutic way to unwind at the end of the day.  It's not so much an epic RPG as a toy you can endlessly tinker with, sort of like a city in Cities: Skylines.  Some days you might run silos and find the final boss.  Other days you might tend to your shop.  You invent little goals and set out to achieve them.
---
I know I never said it was I was just stating what I heard
---
I’m targeting the newer and returning players on this post. Hell I did not know about it until I was looking around there one day. As for the cap amount I forgot to put that on the post.
---
Yup. After I saw them running around downstairs through the floor grate. I heard the elevator ding and thought it was another player but alas, ‘twas the monster come to eat me.
---
That everyone with issues with the game and the "youtubers" were just mad it wasnt fallout 5 and had never played the game. Proof? Evidence to back up your claim?
---
Yesss please.
---
Those are my balls too, and I'm sharing them with everyone.
---
The tick is super slow, in my experience I've never mistakenly killed a brahim with plague walker.
---
A newt.
---
Strenth (9) - Walking Arsenal: All weapons weigh 75% less
---
Yeh man it gets intense especially when you play solo
---
Fuuuuckkk you made me realize i need a pvp build for NW.
---
We aren't needy and gonna use a good suggestion that has been answered to be a begging
---
There's a sprint cap speed from what I understand.
---
At least someone here has their head on straight and knows something about consumer protection laws and cares about them, thank you for being sane.
---
It gives those players unfair advantage by having 3x SBQ loot each time tho.
---
I’m about to be a newb. Just got the game today and it’s downloading right now
---
The flare gun would be perfect for this. It should put a marker on everyone's map.
---
Good shit man
---
Agreed. Also the sidebar is not visible while using the reddit redesign.
---
Ahh, that makes sense, I can understand why that would be useful for you. Though for real, I had no idea English was your... second language (unless you have others) I’m assuming?
---
My best game I killed three ppl with a power fist and got shot to death
---
The post wasn't about those things, even though they would be cool to have. I just wanted to thank Bethesda for listening.
---
Daaamn... 😳
---
That’s perfect! I routinely check for events. It could be like a separate event marker.
---
There is pretty much everything you mentioned except text chat and even if you are on PC just buy a damn mic lol
---
I play with a controller on PC. I'm sure I'm the most useless :D
---
Yeah unless you were actively playing prior to patch and then post patch, you would never have known. It's a good tip for the newbies or players who haven't been on since prior to the patch. 
---
One thing i might consider adding is maybe a disclaimer for the newbies. If they take the wrong route into whitesprings, they are going to be some ghouls dinner 😂 safest route would probably be to follow the railroad and approach from East side.
---
You could have stood close to where the bag was and drop a bullet. Your stuff will move into the new bag.
---
The keg is in the files and shows in the build menu but the plan is not in the actual game yet.     There are a few threads out there all wondering the same thing and coming to the same conclusion.
---
Stone benches was a huge huge pain to get, that one took me from launch to last month to finally get.
---
I put so much junk in that trunk.
---
You can buy it with atoms too
---
Really?
---
It's not part of the OST.
---
Neither is the music in Arktos or the Burrows, for that matter.
---
Huh I don't see it there
---
Just remember not to ads while in the bushes. It marks you even with chameleon mutation. I learned that the hard way
---
That's not an answer. Why does Bethesda get a free pass from you? I'm legitimately curious as it makes no logical sense why someone would just settle for something instead of wanting something to be better than just average. Settling like that is bad for the product, bad for the company that made it, bad for the industry it's a part of and bad ultimately for the consumer who spent money on it. 
---
So why?
---
Happens to me all the time :( I feel awful when the Brahmin happens to be in the same area the fast travel spot it.
---
I feel like if you didn’t think maps were exciting in previous games then this one will bore you to tears. 
---
But I’m a huge fallout fan and even though it’s nowhere as good as the others IMO, it’s still good and I enjoy it.
---
They get vomit and a grenade launcher. I’m all about equal treatment.
---
Yeah, [it may have been mentioned once or twice today](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=canvas&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=day).
---
I'm level 54 I can possibly play later tonight :) I know quite a bit and can help you out a bunch my psn is NotBanned_
---
yeah, but not when every loads in at the same time.
---
HE was talking about as soon as he gets in, people are at him with a gun, doesnt happen like that, you are invisible until you get a weapon
---
If I were you, I would keep playing the trial to try and answer your questions. I think it works through Monday. 
---
Personally, I'm a little let down by server disconnects and lack of living human PCs in the early game, the few hours I played.
---
Yeah, but it was like 3 months ago... there are a lot of people waiting for the Steam release, since they don't want to be stuck with Bethesda Launcher.
---
Yeah. I’m basically out of ammo, gonna spend most of my night collecting lead to re arm.
---
The fact that r/fallout did a full 180 on the game after this update even though it only added a mode and a couple small fixes should make it pretty clear it was just a trend. And how about the trade stealing bug that never existed yet had dozens of posts from "victims" ?
---
Cool story?
---
It isn't against Bethesda's ToS because they are still playing those 3 characters. So they "earn" those 3 loot chances because they are playing the characters.
---
You should go check out other MMO's there are people on WoW who literally play 5 characters at a time, or on Eve play 20+ characters at the same time.
---
Multiboxing is a long standing skill people use in MMO's, and it is completely within the rules.
---
....I mean learn by doing 😂
---
This isn't a debate. How you feel about it doesn't matter. The fact is this: if this sub continues to witch-hunt, it will be banned. 
---
Your comment would be better sent to reddit support, as they are the ones making the decisions on this subject. Our mods are only protecting the integrity of the sub.
---
&gt; So false advertising is okay then? 
---
I didn't say it was okay - I said that in the majority of cases it didn't happen. 
---
&gt; The indisputable fact is some of the money you paid went towards the bag
---
It's pretty disputable. I'm disputing it right now... I'm sure that in some cases people may have ordered while the ad stated the fabric, but certainly not all, or even most.
---
&gt; Exactly what does looking for fuel for the "outrage fire" do?
---
Let me put it this way - I'm happy to hear complaints from anyone effected, and totally uninterested in people having a cry around a topic that impacts them in exactly no way, just because they don't like the game.
---
&gt; Also can you please provide proof that you speak for "most of the people who bought the collectors edition" please? Because if you can't thats just you making baseless assumptions
---
Can you provide proof you do? At least I have the advantage of being one of them.
---
&gt; my young friend.
---
Speaking of baseless assumptions, I'm over forty you presumptuous twat.
---
Come to my base on pc. I have 2k each i cannot fucking move
---
Don't play survival, there are a lot of friendly people on adventure
---
Noooooooo!!!
---
😂
---
How about a petition to remove the macrotransactions period?
---
Damn
---
Nice was wondering how good that would be in here.
---
I normally die first lol
---
Dear god yes
---
Rads make it taste gooder
---
&gt;Is there alot of unique places to explore / find in 76? Past fallout game maps had a lot of boring nothing in them.
---
There ~~is~~ are ~~alot~~ a lot, yes.  But if you thought the past Fallout games were "a lot of boring nothing," you'll probably think that here too.  Fallout 4 was a pretty dense map with lots going on.  Fallout New Vegas' map was very empty and dull though, I'll grant you that.
---
&gt;Is there unique outfits / gear to find or aquire, and are they adding more?
---
There ~~is~~ are, yes.  Don't know if they're adding more or not.
---
&gt;Will text chat come? Have devs spoke on this?
---
No plans that we're aware of.
---
&gt;Is there group content in this game or is everything solo-able. Is there content that pushes you to group up?
---
There is some content that pushes you to team up with others.  Not most of it, though.
---
&gt;What else do devs plan to do with the game?
---
Google "Fallout 76 roadmap."  Outside of that and the E3 thing that just happened, they're tight lipped.  We'll know when we know.
---
Haven’t seen the thing drop yet
---
I play with a controller too and finish top three more times than not. But usually I’m the only one left as my team dies off the back without finding a weapon. NW isn’t super reliant on good aim and more about positioning and perk loadout so if you focus on that you will win gunfights.
---
Damn 3 in a row I've barely got 2
---
I am quite happy with the 2* wood chest I got off the sbq today, thank you very much
---
They are adding living npcs actually
---
If there’s one, I’m sure there’s more.  .., and bicycles, they are all around the place. We should be able to use them as well.
---
Never know I was ok with a controller on PC with titanfall
---
I still like this game
---
You don't have to take rads, put on a hazmat suit.
---
Tbf I played like 3 matches and died within the first 3 minutes each time. Mostly because I'm still figuring out the mode and where to drop, and I queued solo like an idiot.
---
Gonna get my headset out and try again this weekend :)
---
Because I have more important things in life to worry about?
---
Ah he's not winning or camping to top 2. If you win you get plenty of xp to level (around 1k). I looked in the challenges and it shows how many games played and it said 17. I'm level 17. Even if you added the wait time and said 30 minutes a game, that's less than 8 hours. I saw a level 35 today
---
FYI, your fascnacht items/plans are locked to your character not your account. It's obvious I know, but that means if you start a new character there's no way to get any of the fasnacht plans/gear for your new toon.
---
Yeah. As I understand it they will be rolling it out in phases with the NW quest line.   I imagine it won’t be too much of a break in play time though.
---
And people say Nuclear Winter won't kill Adventure Mode. Yeah right. Might as well rename the game Fallout 76: Battle Royale.
---
You ever try to make chicken noodle without boiling the broth? Cold soup is hardly the best....
---
Happened to me yesterday.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Found one earlier. Wiped out my first scorch beast easy as lvl 19.
---
Bummer im super stoked for that game too - I hope that gets reported and tweaked before launch
---
Ps4 and I can’t get the stupid fasley accused mission to complete. Just got around to it cuz I never put on a prison collar.
---
Did it work today?
---
It's either this or the season pass. For Fallout 76 the microtransaction system works considering that the game is going to be getting DLCs for (I think) the next 10 or so years. Can you imagine having to pay for each new DLC for Fallout 76?! Nobody likes having microtransactions shoved down their throat, but Bethesda has to monetize this game some way (which I have nothing against).
---
&gt;I never said it was I was just stating what I heard
---
That's the same as saying it was, otherwise you should say "From what I've heard..."
---
I'm no expert but when my game gets laggy I unplug my xbox for a few minutes. It usually works fine after that. Maybe you need to clear the cache?
---
Maybe
---
Hopefully they add some more shotguns and pistols in the wastelanders update!
---
I feel like this is a huge improvement to the game, a few friends tried the game on the free week and the complaints were the same: combat feels clunky and aiming is shit. 
---
I'm at the point that it's not a big deal for me, but for new players, especially the ones who come from another shooters, this is a huge problem.
---
If anything, that'd be excessively capitalist.
---
Of course we need more shotgun too! :D
---
Basically, yes
---
Whenever I find one and desperately need ammo, it doesn’t have what I need. It would be great to know what would consistently be in there!
---
I think I broke the game I tried it before and that didn't work
---
Yes, it's not a game where you can hoard things to your heart's content, but don't be concerned about scrapping.  You see, unlike in Fallout 4 where having perks like Armorer automatically enabled you to craft any kind of armor or mod you wanted, that stuff has to be *learned* in 76.  The way you learn it through scrapping, acquiring the plans, or buying a mod (a one-time application).
---
Ultimately, any weapon or armor you can scrap at a normal workbench isn't sacred.  When you eventually start getting Legendary gear, any non-Legendary version will be outclassed, and that's the stuff you'll want to repair and mod.
---
For Mutations, what you had is called Marsupial.  Mutation Serums really aren't that hard to time by anymore thanks to player vending, where you'll often find them for around 400 caps.  But to keep a Mutation, you'll need Rank 2 of the Starched Genes perk in Luck.  I think you may need to gain a handful of levels before it becomes available to you, however.
---
You can turn auto fill off.
---
the image.
---
Wife.....
---
If only I wasn’t a console pleb lol. My laptop would commit suicide if I tried running this game. 
---
May I ask how you came to have so much??? Just over time or did you have a  solid method for farming. 
---
I just need to them to craft handmades to scrap for the modifications, and also for repairing all my armor which gobbles up all my gears and screws. I couldn’t imagine having excess gears and screws!!!!!
---
No
---
I’ve played a lot Apex, Ping System is awesome. You should give it a try!
---
they both 100% do.  look up the definition, they are virtually the same, a cheat is any form of gaming the system, whether by external tool or exploiting design flaws, either way is cheating.
---
Have you gone to the exam location
---
That's one of the most ignorant fucking things I've read in a long time. To paraphrase a famous quote, "everyone in this thread is now dinner for having read that. I award you a downvote, and may Todd have mercy on your soul.
---
Don't look too deeply into the server disconnects.  This week is kind of an aberration, since there are so many new players flooding out of the Vault and spinning up new world instances.  In the handful of weeks prior to this, it has been very smooth sailing.
---
Ok we can do this all day, good to know I getting English lessons on Reddit
---
Something a witch would say! *draws furious flamer pitchfork*
---
Son we just made it across the street.. let’s not throw a party till we’re out of the city..
---
Hey! So I use a Bloodied Explosive handmade. Do you have 5 tanks in demolitions expert?
---
If you’re on xbox I can make all mutation serums except scaly skin.
---
thank you the wikis are incorrect on their facts then
---
Use the Purified Water to dilute Radaways. 
---
Wear a Hazmat Suit. 
---
Equip Lead Belly. 
---
There are so many better uses for Purified Water that it would be silly to waste it like that.
---
I'd be fine with this if the Brahmin didn't become hostile for no reason.
---
I hope your right. I think I've accumulated over 2 hours of loading times today
---
Only items purchased in atom shop carry over to nuclear winter. So you'd need to buy some glasses or whatever outfit first.
---
It will probably happen when nw is launched
---
Nil lag issues, just long wait times for matches &amp; it exited me out the last couple of times I did eventually get in.
---
I can go into adventure with nil issues, its just a nuclear winter issue
---
I still don’t have my backpack! I’m using Good with Salt.
---
You mean the card icon disappears from your name on the team list in the HUD, or your teammates say it’s no longer showing on their side?
---
The icon and the buff disappears.
---
Welcome to games with a br component.
---
Why
---
When you have a .50 machine gun and still can’t land a shot. I’ve been pretty good at healing though.
---
She's alive for sure. I mean stimpacks bring us back when our leg is sticking out backwards
---
Why not
---
As a lose guide, you should follow this level based map. Will help out by avoiding areas way to hard to handle. Rose is typically the spot where stuff gets tough as you will eventually venture into savage divide and across the map where enemies can reach level 90+ 
---
I'd suggest explore the safer regions, you might have missed some side quests. Also participate in world events, those will give you supplies and xp needed to level up.
---
hah, sure, I guess I prefer to form my own opinions instead of following along with the crowed of babies online that want to complain about everything.
---
Maybe she didn't actually die in the holotape, perhaps she recovered. I would be dissapointed if she was dead, I really want to meet her as an NPC.
---
My camp is o ly 20 percent full and it still takes minutes to load on startup.
---
I respectfully disagree with this this map has more variety then any game before by at least 2 times as much
---
To add, you have to click on the items you bought in the atom shop. A bomb icon will show on them.
---
Couldn't of said it better myself. Been cleaning up all week.
---
i got it off the dragon is that the only way to obtain it?
---
I didn’t even realize you could get it, but I got it and was completely in awe of how effective it was.
---
Pretty much the same. I found it actually got worse at end game due to the lack of good end game things to do. Kill the SBQ, kill the sheepsquatch, try to do arktos pharma without crashing. Repeat.
---
I put a junk collector at my camp.
---
the damage numbers are cool because now i can finally see how much damage the server is ignoring
---
I just never wanna cross play with PC that ruins so many games
---
Oh HELL yes.
---
As far as I can tell, it's still there.
---
The exam location is different for physical and knowledge
---
*Hek
---
You see a mini nuke in the top left corner of the item so you know if its equipped for NW
---
Look at the comments on the reveal back when it was announced at e3. People saying they wouldnt play it because it wasnt fallout 5 or that cus it has multiplayer some youtubers boycotting for same reasons.
---
No, I got it off a Nuclear Winter Terminal weapon drop.  When you hack the terminal it usually gives you a choice between revealing enemies, a piece of nuke code, or a stimpak.  However sometimes it gives you the ability to get a weapon, and that is what I got it from.
---
Just got indent to menu &amp; hit resume, didn't boot me this time :)
---
Remeber that one time a fake bug came up? People were posting about a bug where players were able to steal your gear if they traded with you. The funny thing is it never actually existed in game. I liturally saw comment after comment of people saying it happend to them. They hated the game so much they were willing to lie and create bugs when there were a plethera of actual bugs to complain about. It got really rediculious in the beginning.
---
You can get it from the Nuclear Winter Terminals.  I didn’t think much of it until I arc killed an entire squad with a single mag.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/0OXJajN
---
Yes please. My house would looked much better decked out with more atomic shop items and items I hang up to consider personal trophies.
---
Yeah I see your point but I want my 6 floOR MANSION FULLY DECORATED duh
---
Get a backpack from the pioneer scout. It makes playing so much easier if you don’t use power armor
---
It’ll always stay white just don’t shoot at it!  I feel like it’s sort of a preview for what’s to come.  Wait til you kill your first one!
---
Welcome to the grind. Pick a weapon you like and get the perk cards that increase its effectiveness. Learn how to smelt lead from lead ore and how to make gunpowder from acid and cloth. Start hoarding ammo. Don’t put a bullet into it unless you can’t kill it easily with a melee weapon. It’s 1000x better to grind up a crowd of scorched or liberators with a sledgehammer than to waste ammo on them. Keep making and hoarding ammo, you gets tons of XP from crafting lead, gunpowder, and ammo. When you have lots of ammo, start visiting sugar grove, national astronomy and Morgantown for scrap and to get into squabbles with decently leveled enemies. Keep your eyes peeled for a good legendary weapon that’s in your preferred class.
---
This is the official Fallout 76 subreddit, so...
---
Not sure, wasn’t working 12 hours ago. Will probably try in a few hours.
---
Despite the downvotes, I think it's reasonable they lose their brahmin when they sell crap nonlegendaries.
---
People are seriously selling the worst they can find just to troll people into fast traveling, and loading just to find garbage.
---
Their lucky I cant destroy the machine..
---
You can’t lol dude above is confused
---
I'm on xbox and I havent heard anyone
---
Chug a bottle of booze and sell sell sell! Food expires and you will have way too much drugs and waters so sell it all to the bots for fast travel monies 😁
---
That'd be cool, there's a functional locomotive in Harper's ferry.
---
Or just have a icon on the new unlocks, or highlight the new camp unlocks
---
This really needs to be a thing. Some events (like the enclave cache) or random encounters (mr. prize bot) will give you a huge wad of pre war money. Government supply drops and safes are essentially guaranteed to have some. It feels like they were setting up a system for pre war money trading in this game - except it's worthless because pre war money has weight (quite a lot of it) and gives you one of the most common and simultaneously useless resources in the game
---
Or maybe, just maybe there's a whole bunch of people that listened to the reviews and thought the game was a steaming pile of shit. Then they get a chance to play and realize that isn't the case.
---
Nah, youre right. BGS is obviously paying hundreds of people with names like cumbucket69 and PM_me_ur _smegma to hype their game.
---
Bethesda should make an archive of everything that's been in the Atomic shop
---
What if when they arrive, they’re like plastic or cardboard, lmao.
---
Ahh gotcha that was my misunderstanding. But yeah with the scorched it’s a really cool idea
---
Isn’t it the 17th?
---
That's there but they are still all mixed in with the items you havent. Its just messy. Not game-breaking by any stretch, but definitely a desired QOL improvement. It would just help make the Atom Shop more player friendly.
---
Bet it is a f2p account too. So he won't even face any repercussions.
---
Grab a friend.
---
I agree with you, but this post wasn't about those issue, even though they deserve more attention than the Atomic Shop's issues.
---
F
---
As far as I know I’ve never had a problem with it, most often if I was doing a white spring run it came in handy as a lower level
---
Yesterday i set out to find lead... Got distracted by how ugly my camp was. 4hrs later and broke from buying plans i got a home i can be proud of... And still no lead.
---
It didn't lead me to believe that. She was hurt bad for sure, but she lived.
---
Gimmie a nickel
---
This was suggested in May or April , and Bethesda responded. Can't find the thread tho
---
thank you sooooo much I feel dumb for not realizing that
---
so... no rewards after 100?
---
Hey, the ammo machine has a very clear purpose - it baits you into thinking it's the legendary machine when you're far away at a station you don't visit often
---
All my junk goes to my constantly breaking armor. I swear my chest piece breaks every half an hour.
---
No cross play. It's too easy for people on PC to cheat.
---
Everyone has that, but i think it would be nice if there was a tab of all of the things you own
---
"but if you want to buy new games it may be best to buy a console (and F76) in Canada so you don't have to purchase from an EU store."
---
Covered it 😉 Just don't see why anyone would want to keep a different regional code platform around 🤷‍♂️ Might as well sell it before moving if you ask me - again, just for the fact of new games and not being forced to buy from an EU store.
---
The dude is using multiple f2p accounts. He doesn't care if he gets banned. It is why like 3 very similar names have been doing it.
---
That's just stupid.
---
Now I feel like I have to buy an outfit just for NW
---
I will take photos of me sitting at train stations sitting on a bench waiting for someone using the vendor.  I try to collect photos from every train station.
---
How so?
---
Private Servers could lead to crossplay.
---
Sugar grove and national astronomy can net you 40+ screws and gears. Take every desk fan and telephone you find.
---
Not sure if he is "pro" but I enjoy his content and he is generally good at Fo76
---
The Wanderer
---
Probably shroud
---
What happened?
---
You can still see if they have been banned or not by checking the name of the character. The dude in this video has been hacking all week. You can even google his name and find dozens of videos over the last week of him doing this. Bethesda isn't banning him...
---
I think it's fun. So since I'm more than no one, than your terrible logic is already invalidated.
---
He thought I was genuinely trying to insult him.
---
Honestly I havent even played FO76 since around thanksgiving and completely forgotten the whole bag thing.
---
In general, yes. At least in adventure mode. I've stopped even hiding from other players and it is a rare experience some one tries to shoot me (like less than once a day). People have gotten a little less generous now that we have player vending but in general at worst people leave  you alone.
---
Damn man, I'm only at about 15 hours!
---
Yeah but it was mostly like this even when you could try to kill some one else.
---
It has been atrocious
---
Sure. What's your gamertag?
---
Same here.
---
Well, there’s the “phone a friend”method... hypothetically you call a well equipped associate who walks down the center of the street while you place small caliber / fast hit / easy recoil rounds on target.  Afterwards your companion crushes their skulls, thus sharing the XP.  
---
Granted, not as satisfying as the solo accomplishment, but it does work for some who use multiple characters to obtain a desired level or specific weapon perk access.
---
Is it really that easy???? I’m definitely just lazy then lmao.
---
Quite a few comments here, but I'll throw this out there. If the pre war cash becomes a "currency" in that respect, dont let the scrap all hit it.
---
If carnivore worked like cannibal, you'd have edible bodies on 100% of the map with both perks equipped.
---
Ah ok thanks, so no glasses in the shop.
---
There's a small terminal entry that explains it. 
---
ZAX got X02 plans shipped to the Vault by impersonating Braun and sending a message to the Enclave, who were presumably developing it. 
---
It clearly never got into mass production, and we can assume that in 3, the Enclave were forced to resume working on it
---
Good stuff!
---
I just got an email from Bethesda, with the same tracking number, definitely confirming this is it.
---
Are we sure giving new players nukashine is "friendly"?
---
I support this cause.
---
No way. This is half the fun of the game. It used to be fun destroying camps but they nerfed that. Now I have to get my jollies by visiting all the camps on the map and killing their pets. 
---
Some guy was working on his base the other day so I had him follow me to a brown paper bag with cat meat in it. Then had him follow me to said cat. Dude was pissed. I ROLF'd hard.
---
I won a couple games with randos today.. [https://imgur.com/QkvQmYS](https://imgur.com/QkvQmYS)
---
It's not too hard, launched a nuke too, dropped a couple of codes for a guy with the case. If you want to solo, boring but you can play the bushes too. It's not like you get something special for winning it anyway.
---
It's a skin for any power armor, like the Plague Rider skins
---
SMGs do count as auto rifles in this game. The .45 smg is amazing with commando, I've taken out entire squads in power armor by popping a stealth boy and psycho and pushing with that thing.
---
Its not that bad of an idea. Ever since the new wave of players, I'm having a significantly harder time grouping and selling/buying. I think the better idea would be to balance Survival to be more difficult PvE wise.
---
She turned me into a newt!
---
The descriptions for the Power Armor skins aside from the Inferno skins mention Ultracite, and in the files they're set up to give you skins for Ultracite. I'll let you know if that's actually the case once I unlock the blue camo paint.
---
Brahmin Cows are the new Chickens.
---
Ahhhhhh I see
---
I don't think so, you don't even see other teams emoting in vault 51.
---
The game was awesome for my first hour. Then it turned shit because it became a lag feast. It is not all bethesdas fault because there is a weapon clonning glitch and people are exploiting it to clone weapons probably on macros till the server exceeded their memory.
---
Still their fault because the bug was in beta and it took them months after the official release to fix it. It basically lost all reputation by then.
---
Also all the lies about better graphics when dataminers showed that bethesda was too lazy to even rename their assets from fallout 4 and skyrim. You get things like dragon grounded animation or raider movement etc in fallout 76.
---
The company was lazy imo and as a paid consumer inwas sorely disappointed
---
Exactly or this. I guess I’m in the minority that wants the whole map to be a little harder? Idk I would just like to see the forest with some higher level enemies and even nuke that area in general.
---
Emart51
---
if you want cool stuff, build less turrets food and extracters/water purifiers... you can build a HUGE camp if you don't have 5 or more turrets, 3 water purifiers and a glue farm...
---
Not right now though. At work
---
"Game improves as time is spent developing it. More news at 11."
---
/s
---
It just shows you what Bethseda really cares about!
---
Somebody get this to Bethesda!  Upvote upvote upvote!
---
There's a terminal you can access at low levels, it does say the Overseer's status is unknown compared to a everyone else who's marked as deceased. 
---
There was also one person who's job or fate was [REDACTED] though I don't know if it's relevant.
---
You probably just need to slow down. When you enter a location like that take EVERYTHING. Loot every file cabinet, crate, desk and toolbox you see and look under, over, and behind things. For Sugar grove for example you’ll probably find 10-15 items out in the world that contain screws but 15-20 more that spawned in the lootable containers. Especially the toolboxes, sometimes you’ll find toolboxes that just have 7-10 screws sitting in it
---
I dont understand why, after I place an item like a floor, the next one goes back to being crooked and wants to place in every last spot I want it...  EVERYTIME.
---
Then make a post about those issues you listed, I'd upvote it
---
The current map runs a hell of a lot smoother than in adventure. Stripping out everyone's inventory, every loot able world object, and removing most of the AI mobs does wonders for streamlining things.
---
No, but 20/20 is I believe heavy for limbs. 68/68 for chest
---
I’ve not seen such receiver either - and I’ve intentionally collected them all.
---
.38 and .45 caliber plans for the auto and revolver pipes (including semi and full auto variants)
---
.308 caliber in the bolt action pipes - which are horrible for follow up shots simply due to the sheer recoil.
---
The vendor at Grafton train station has all the plans for sale if you were searching for a specific set to mod without scrapping.
---
A newt?
---
Lol least I'm not the only one having issues lol
---
No problem haha.. I just did it myself. New player also. It’s pretty easy you shouldn’t have a issue.
---
Eeeeevil shenanigans
---
Gotcha. When do you think you will be on?
---
Monty python quote! Lol the old with hunt scene from the holy grail.
---
Pretty sure it would do what it already does currently..  and that's remove the "tree" or something a little later than it should.
---
Ether way, it takes a long time to load our camps not because if the camps in general.  I just narrowed down to a 15% budget camp, and it still takes minutes to load each piece
---
30 more!  You get 30 per machine.
---
It gives 30 more
---
And what about all the broken cameras? If they were handymen, they should have been able to fix them!
---
Oh thanks. I looked through the top posts and new posts and didn't see anything.
---
Without a small cap, this is just going to promote cheating and camping. The mode is supposed to be fast and fun. If it's worth too much people start trying to win it any way possible and that means sitting alone in the forest waiting out the timer.
---
I've seen camps with 4 machines. Dont know if there is a cap on machines. I have 2.
---
My character must be dying to see a dentist after all that nuka cola and sugar bombs
---
Oof never thought that way &gt;.&lt; got 3 perks points into reducing the weight of food and water
---
Check out the reddit fallout discord for people to play with in voice chat discord.gg/falloutreddit
---
I haven’t had much time to tweak my build, just focusing on playing and earning as much xp as possible. Psycho + commando  for the SMG is an awesome combination. Have had 10+ kill games just with that.
---
Yes. Getting tired of disconnects.
---
Wait you mean you don't run the ghoulish, cannibal and carnivore combo?
---
And what else floats?
---
You touch a man's brahmin, you might as well touch his woman. Damn rights he should become wanted.
---
That would be just as good ha ha
---
Yeah what gives with all the broken cameras too? Somebody out there was making a killing repairing them I’m sure
---
Just a Level 2 trying to grind for the power armor skins. As for the story, my first fight from my first game was a fist fight where neither of us could hit each other
---
Taco bell
---
I kinda like the game despite not really liking the survival aspects (hunger/thirst/etc), just not sure if it was my latency or the servers giving me a hard time in combat.
---
Of course...but why not make it run better in **the main gamemode** too?
---
A few power armor skins a bundle of atoms that come with the elder battle coat
---
I vote for this. I have been having so much fun and I've actually made friends with people that I've matched up with on there.
---
Don't remove it please.
---
That’s good news. Plan on opening up a small storefront near flatwoods to sell all sorts of junk. Thank you!
---
Stealth crit sniper is easily the highest damage output in the game as long as you don't get detected.
---
 Protip: when using vats, hold down spacebar so you fire your crits as soon as you get them, you will be filling your crit meter very rapidly with some of the luck perks.
---
Yes I think I saw the perk cards had Babylon prefixes in another data mine
---
What would be in the 70s or 80s for er and dr without being legendary?  I got it once as loot and it was red
---
Left 4 Dead 3?
---
There's a bit of kudos in getting an interesting scoop like this too.
---
Their probably still going to take it down and maybe address a few of the minor problems. The community has also given some feedback I hope Bethesda will add to nuclear winter.
---
We dint receive burning damage from drinking boiled water..  so I'm going to guess it's just as cold as purified
---
Uh yeah how about those raids?
---
I'm guessing they're being delayed because the instancing isn't done yet...
---
Using a survival mode scenario prob wasnt the best idea to persuade them to make this lol.
---
I cant tell you how many times I've wanted to say "I'm sorry" through and emote though
---
Did you beat the queen or sheepsquatch?
---
Rewards from SBQ
---
Also ability to switch to first person view while spectating? Or is it supposed to feel like you are a camera following the player..?
---
Insult bot got me for first time today, I was turning in BOS technical document and I hear a robot.... He walks up and tells me he would attack me but he can't hurt me anymore than life already has. Burned randomly by a robot &gt;.&lt;. Would def be a cool feature if you could send one of the bots to someone for a fee or something.
---
&gt; Come on man, this is common sense 101 
---
Modestly rude there.
---
That said, it's a point of view thing. "Complete" could mean "Win" or it could mean "Play as far as you can." For a daily challenge, the latter would make more sense. As it is, it's a challenge basically unattainable outside of insane game play times or a certain degree of luck. The problem is, completing that challenge might well result in a power powerful opponent, which means odds of others completing becomes even lower.
---
Reboot game
---
Everyone seems to think the game is the same as it was at launch.
---
You have big famous youtubers constantly and still today jumping on the "Bethesda man bad" train. I'd name a few who have recently done this but I don't know where that falls on the rules.
---
Tldr: big people still give it a bad rep even with its progression
---
So when the weekly challenge on tues came out I managed to complete some in adventure mode. Milk a brahmin worked. Last night the scoreboard said I got 4 out 5 challenges complete in adventure mode not survivor. I milked a Brahmin again today and I completed the challenge and I got the salt of the earth shotgun. How about challenges like this in adventure mode. Not a fan of survivor mode
---
But... If I can't kill Brahmin, how will I express my passive aggressive rage?
---
The thing is, you just die easily regardless. Even with a full god-tier set you’ll die. Quit bitching for more nerfs.
---
 sneak crit builds are great for bosses because you fight them in a group so you can remain undetected and score endless sneak attacks
---
Legit cried when my brahmin died
---
The Silver Shroud?
---
Yo dude you should add me: tamiasrodentia on psn. I need more friends who have mics!
---
Same thing happened to me I was doing literally the same mission and all I just heard was some weird movement happening and I was not thinking about it much it just gave a me a bit of the heebee jeebes, but I was like"it was probably nothing" then I moved up stairs and a wendigo and his feral buddies just popped up out of the elevator and scared the crap out of me and i literally almost peed myself because I was not expecting that to happen at nowhere and it killed me.
---
While wearing a tin foil hat
---
Anyone got solid aiming tips??
---
My shot is just terrible but I suspect it could improve on 3rd person. So I'm wondering what do you all do.
---
Churches!
---
as a long time player, I have noticed more lag/disconnects this week than in the past three months (still only a few), so I am assuming that all of the free trial folks are giving the servers a workout.
---
Disembodied doll Arms?.... exactly.
---
Awesome!  Great way to make caps
---
I saw a player build a whole camp in Nuclear Winter. Metal walls and everything wtf...
---
Well I’m glad it wasn’t just me at least. They took basically all my shotgun rounds and stimpacks to put down.
---
You'd also have to kill those bodies, and the density is far less than the plant life.
---
There's more than likely more trees in the forest than there are enemies in the game.
---
ok but when you “complete” the match by not winning and you didnt get the challenge, the logical point of view would be that you have to win a game. 
---
it isnt supposed to be easy. its a challenge. does it really make sense that all you would have to do is queue into a match to get the challenge?
---
Placing first gets about 500 exp
---
I only use excavator armor so I've been grabbing any near complete chassis I find in the higher level areas and dumping them at the overseers camp with a full core. Either they turned fusion core spawns up or it's related to my brief usage of a gatling laser... but I've been flush with fusion cores lately.
---
Do the mistress of mystery quests.  They give out great xp for mid 20s low 30s. Miner miracles is another good one to look for.
---
You need to shoot me to start pvp
---
That sounds amazing!  Thank you for answering my questions.  It isn't Fallout unless we have an animal companion.
---
Was it maybe like a rust color? Probably reinforced.
---
Find a group to run with. This game isn't a solo type of game. Atleast in my experience. It's boring solo, but I have a blast shooting stuff with my 7 other buddies
---
I had no clue this was a feature but god damn im happy it is
---
Wont work.. I can't revive you if were enemies. Need a big drop but just enough to go down but not die
---
I've mainly had the hiccups related to the occasional xbox game freeze, which put it more to the base xbox one console than anything with 76
---
Exactly!!!! I want that paint job for my excavator armor, but 1800 is wayyyyyyy too much. I can see  say 600 but 1800 is a lot of scratch. Lower your price for this paint job, or increase the atoms to 50 or 100 per challenge please
---
Of course this guy posts in T_D lmao
---
Personally, I just realized how spoiled I've been by speed demon and marsupial. Yet to see those in Nuclear Winter either.
---
That's not the final holotape I don't think.  &gt;!I believe the final one is once you launch a nuke anywhere other than at the Prime Fissure Site.  If you launch anywhere else you can find one at the nuke site entrance where she chides you and your fellow survivors for being idiots and blowing each other up.  There's also the fact that she's narrating the trailer for the new/upcoming DLC.!&lt;
---
If you are a ranged build, you can farm Grafton Days fairly easily.  Train the monster to a choke point; my favorite was the metal shed with a fusion generator between the train station and town center. This will get you exp and maybe some better gear 
---
An easy junk run was going up to the hunting lodge and going clockwise to the trailer home, public pool, and clarksburg shooting range to scrap the junk.  Dont go to the farm just east of the lodge without scouting first.  Otherwise the baddies are fairly easy and you can conserve ammo.
---
Lead can be had in gyms from barbells, but thos are like fishin holes, some are favored secrets ;)
---
If I remember gunpowder can be found on raiders or in many ammo boxes, with ties nicely yo your Rose quests since they are all around Top of the World.
---
From my exp and what ove seen from others, the Rose quests tend to be a hanging point.  Good luck.
---
Hi! Beebz420 here, thanks for the shout out! My friend found this post when they googled my username for some reason. 
---
I am so glad someone enjoyed my Whitespring night club! I wish I took more screen shots of it.  I am currently set up near Fort Defiance in a strip club! Feel free to come check it out 😎
---
Oh the battle coat, is it limited time?
---
You need the actual armor piece, before applying the mod. For BoS is combat armor and for robot is you guessed it robot. It's your decision if it's sturdy, heavy or light and if you have the plans ofc.
---
bring back the raider excavator power armor skin!
---
https://i.redd.it/sihoyun3o1921.jpg
---
Now it's just spawned a 'they are only doing this because the game is failing' narrative
---
Scout armor paints.
---
There is no point and it would waste resources to create.
---
or both
---
Thats what it was.  Wasnt legendary so I scrapped it
---
Oh?
---
Thanks for the guide! Someone started the event and i only joined after the bugs came, so I didn't know where the kindling was, and the only other player left, so i was stuck clueless wondering why i can't fuel the fire with wood.
---
I’d like to be able to see if my teammates have Stims or Radaway. 
---
I know they can compile all Stims into a number (how many Stims it says you have when you hit right d-pad) I just wish that number would pop up if I was at the map for my team
---
It's a pre beta whatever that means. 
---
But still I don't see why they can't keep it going and work on it at the same time. It's not as if they have to take down adventure mode to work on updates for that. 
---
Of course if people are level 101 before the full mode comes out that isn't good.
---
I hope sneak peek is referring to all of the player that get to play for free right now. They get a sneak peek.
---
Okay thank you! Yes I did just beat my first one and it was awesome but I had no clue that was a reward thank you!
---
I get this too, I feel like every match it tells me I level up and thats just not the case.
---
That would be an interesting server wide event. Someone has to go and power up grafton steel and at least one power plant in order to produce new steel railroad rails, and someone else has to take over a workshop that produces wood or farm a shitload of wood to make railroad ties. From there, players have to take rails and railroad ties and walk the railroad from station to station, repairing breaks in the line. As a reward, every station they connect becomes a free fast travel point for the entire server.
---
It was the SBQ thanks
---
Np ^^ enjoy. They're nice for emergencies.
---
Yes but you have to buy atoms to get it
---
"Face palm" emote
---
It sucks, it says I’ve leveled up in adventure at least 3 times.

---
Use a stimpac diffuser
---
Fucking...why is this never explained to the player?? I'm level 73 and I'm just now finding out what that means
---
Preach it brother
---
I play with my 9 y/o. It's really great.
---
 Come to me.. Im at grafton damn. We will get this
---
Would be very cool if you could (like with vegetable starch Turning into advhesive) something that requires a bunch of steel and some plastic and you could create like a “precise mold: gear or precise mold: screws” and it could yield a bunch of whichever you were looking for at a healthy cost
---
Dang, thanks for letting me know
---
I would recommend being level 50 at the very least!
---
Those exist now
---
I'm using a card that uses 40% less AP when sprinting. And a card that regens AP 60% faster. Not a bad combo. It's all how you stack your builds.
---
You will need to get to level 50 to have your max number of perk points.  And even then, you still might not have all these specific cards.  4 co-op level 50 players won't need "team" perks so I wouldn't go with more than 4 on Charisma.
---
I hope to see the emote/communication changes as well, pinging alone would be nice. I dont really see the problem with the run AP though there are perks already you can take to fix that. I assume new match will be in the game at full release.
---
I just figured it out by mistake. Picking flowers and was getting 4 per plant! Made 100 healing salves that day haha
---
Why? Just sell it in your vendor store. I make anywhere from 3000-5000 caps in a 3 or 4 hour play session just buy crafting and selling ammo.
---
(QUICK UPDATE) after countless hours of reinstalling the game and reloading I've entered the servers. If you encounter this problem, I wish you the best of luck fellow friend. It will be a long one. No clue what I did but 8th time the charm? Amirite?
---

Shoot a Radstag with a syringer.
---
I put the money forward it just looked so good, but again there were a few free things
---
4 is the cap for up to 120 storage, also keep in mind that they will only see the inventory of the machine they are looking at so keep them visible and organization is nice.
---
Shoot a wolf with a syringer.
---
Not gonna happen man unless someone literally carries u through the whole process.
---
So frustrating. It’s hard to be tough in survival. People that are tough worked for it. 
---
It’s the easiest it’s ever been to get to that level too. You could get everything you need to be, at a minimum, competitive in survival with like 30k caps? 
---
Which, is easy to do now, just takes time. You could do it in a night if a buddy was helping you. Otherwise it would take a week or two. Many of us, I think it said on a poll the other day over 40%, have played since the BETA. That means that 40% have been playing for a very long time and probably deserve to be a bit scarier in the wasteland.
---
That’s probably what it is..how else would the area affected by the fire be restored for every round. Also they’d run out of people 🤣
---
Shoot a Yao Guai with a syringer.
---
You know people complain about legendary effects because they are random, right? You know having better luck with legendaries doesn't make you a better player, right? You aren't actually stupid, you're just playing around, right?
---
Yea, by growing that extra tongue, you get double the taste!
---
Yes like a rust red.  It looked like jagged diamond plated on the front.  Like pointy
---
Plus the firestorm is perfectly circular.
---
I don't think they should take away legendaries from survival, but I think a mode that has no vats and no legendary gear would be pretty awesome as well. Hopefully if private servers become a thing there will be a few.
---
How do you reboot a game? Or are you saying to reboot my xbox?
---
I would love a refrigerator. Then you need to worry about people picking the lock and emptying it.
---
Yeah, I should have gotten a few levels, but I have not.
---
hard to understand downvoting a comment like yours. ty always for your hard work for this game
---
That’s it?
---
Doesn’t seem worth hassle of this back pack mod
---
Possum Badge (Musician)
---
Complete the One Violent Night event. (Done it 3 times but didn't get credit)
---
Yeah i did it accidentally while inside the bunker... made for an interesting time. 😂
---
Play a bass.
---
Because you still touch yourself even after PSN said not to
---
Hey Dummy, go trade with people r/market76 has everything you could ever need. Check people’s vendors. I’ve had a bunch of good drops in all of my time playing, but only a few that work for me. That’s the point, you trade your stuff away, and get better stuff with that! 
---
RNG is a bitch when you’re just one person, but not that bad when you’re using the community to your advantage.
---
Play a snare drum.
---
It’s definitely possible. I started the trial day one and I’m currently level 48.
---
I’m lvl 200 and have died plenty to other players with better gear and or skills. I didn’t complain . I practiced, got better gear, asked others how they play, and now I am good. Most of the ppl that complain are kids. The want everything nerfed to the way they play.
---
Make it a daily or weekly challenge and I could see that being a realistic possibility.
---
This is the best advice ive seen on here, the Mistress of Mystery questline isnt hard, with the exception of grabbing the sword for low levels. It will get you lots of levels and a great storyline, I would start here.
---
Play an acoustic guitar.
---
👍👍👍

At that point it'd be best to just tie it into a daily NW challenge.
---
Play any musical instrument at the Nukashine.
---
Play any musical instrument at the Rusty Pick.
---
This would be good.  I won my first game last night, but only because my team was amazing.  I did my part, but they carried me to the very end and gave me the weapon I needed to take out the last guy right after he got them.  They deserved the win just as much.
---
Props bro! Of course, no one walks in and is good. I like this game because it hasn’t completely given up its RPG elements.
---
Someone once said to me “I love PvP in this game because it’s dynamic, it’s always something new, new battles, players, locations.”
---
And I couldn’t agree more. A lot of players are similar, but it’s still a very personal experience.
---
The meals created perks like +20 carry weight or a +20 crit damage are great reasons to create food. Or +15 melee damage or +2 str in my opinion are worth it. The s’mores recipe not so much. And the scorchbeast meat grinder is next to impossible
---
Play any musical instrument at Watoga High School.
---
It’s been on sale numerous times since it’s been out. Just a few days ago Amazon has the at $17, and it’s been lower.
---
ty friend
---
Another issue is that the storm is to fast and takes to much of your health when your in the storm. The storm should not go 2× faster then you can run. When you got 5 seconds of running your not going to get out the storm like come on man. Just look at black ops 4 with blackout
---
I do, but some ammo just doesn't sell regardless of the price
---
Just to check you have 9 charisma and the people on the team dont already have the perk or trying to share it?
---
A lot if people lol. And there was a sale, a few days ago at least. That's when I bought it
---
Jesus, how? I got this like 4 days ago and just level 22. Is there a good xp farm?
---
yes.best thing to do it hop servers doing the campfire event. it occasionally rewards you with a badge
---
A fireplace “wall” piece for our C.A.M.P. would be pretty awesome. I’d love to have a big old fireplace on the wall! (A few different variants like a cabin style, a modern looking one, and maybe a ornate one)
---
Otherwise, some mountain man looking outfits would be really cool! 
---
I’m going for a trapper/mountain man look with my home and character right now, and it’d be awesome to have something like that (luckily the imposter Sheepsquatch outfit is pretty close for now!)
---
I have 5 char, using Magnetic to get enough to share
---
I don’t see private servers coming anytime soon, if ever. 
---
And isn’t that essentially NW? I’m never bothered too much by VATS. I do think that Auto-rifles and Crit Savy-15 luck combo needs to be looked at, but that’s a personal gripe I suppose
---
I believe this happens if your base charisma is lower than the share threshold. If you buff your charisma above the threshold it will allow you to share the perk as long as you stay in the pip boy. Alternatively if your base charisma is at threshold but you are suffering from addiction or your charisma is otherwise debuffed (blight, etc) it does the same thing. This is all speculation so don't quote me on it, but this is how it seemed a few months ago when a friend and I experimented with charisma sharing.
---
Try carrot soup. Or blight soup....
---
Mmmmm good.    🤠
---
Then it really would be Fallout Sims.
---
Holy shit block of text. Add in a TLDR lmao
---
There is a point, certain world events like Arktos Pharma are very hard to complete and when half your server is under level 50 its hard to even find a team to go do the event. High level servers would make it easier to do raids and Hard Solo Events without having a premade team.
---
system?
---
Haaaa
---
Damn okay I’ll leave them then and server hop for the event 😂 thank you!
---
Maybe it was the free-states members pre-war doing a little reloading at work
---
4 with Green Thumb or without?
---
I’m roughly lvl 18 I believe, if you don’t mind that I ask but what special perk would I need to put points into for that perk. I’m not fond of killing the mega sloth and it would be awesome to try and tame it.
---
I don't enjoy the calamity of NW. It's too chaotic and random and short. I enjoy the slow stalking and hunt of survival, but I totally understand people being turned off by the people who have meta builds essentially being unkillable by newer players/ non legendary using players.
---
I think I saw a leak of other map cutouts, I think they will do a changing map with seasons if I had to guess. Keep in mind this is just a teaser a trial, kinda an open Beta for the mode to find out what they want to do for final implementations
---
"I'll get you my pretty, you and your mutant hound too!"
---
You can. You create a party at the menu before you start the game mode.
---
I imagine the Charleston one would have to have fewer people. Or maybe it’d be a quicker mode for solo queuers
---
Plus there is a shimmer everytime you start a match like the simulation is finishing loading up around you
---
Mistress of Mystery was an amazing adventure story.
---
This makes me wish we had worldwide servers, because, my friend, I would stop by all the time. Thank you for sharing this, you beautiful soul ❤.
---
They aren't random when everyone is buying the same duped gear. That's the caps he was talking about spending.
---
I'm sorry for your loss, but glad you got to share what you could with him. Stay strong brother.
---
Vault 51s door is open so I think it is a nuclear fire storm
---
Pc or console?
---
That's really rough. My bloody melee character is loving it, hopefully you can find it cheap somewhere
---
This has bothered me a bit too, mainly with the clothing and armor section.
---
I've noticed this happens when buying things at a vendor now too
---
Im at the hot dog place.. Let these gouls down me then you kill em?
---
Not everyone runs the same gear, but to get unique gear is a lot harder and more expensive. But the duped sets that are very well circulated are good but they’re not the best.
---
That's your invisibility at the start of the match, though.
---
I want the boxing ring!!!
---
I buy physical copies because I think the cases look nice all lined up.

could this be your issue
---
Thanks :) It just feels like there needs to be some other ways of temporarily connecting with others to help out, and ways to find help if you don’t know a lot of other active gamers.
---
If you're on ps4 i have one i can sell to you. I'll never use the blood thing anyways
---
It’s on sale for PS4 I think.
---
Why do they all have “babylon_” at the beginning?
---
I just checked tonight.  
---
Inert flex is 25% thirst and weighs 0.2.  Purified water is 25% thirst and weights 0.5.  But....  with a max Thru-Hiker perk, purified water weighs 0.05 while Inert Flux weight remains at 0.2. 
---
So, the weight of purified water is affected by the Thru-Hiker perk and the weight of Inert Flux isn’t.  
---
You would need a level 2 Thru-Hiker for purified water to weight the same as Inert Flux.  A level 3 makes purified water 4x lighter. 
---
Basically, if you run with max Thru-Hiker then go with purified water.   Anything below that and your probably better off using Inert Flux.
---
From data-mining, it's supposed to fill the AP bar immediately. If it doesn't do that then it's probably not working at all.
---
Happening to me too starting a couple days ago. Frustrating as fuck
---
Heavy BoS armor is still the best. Scout Amor is getting popular because you can finally get legendary versions of it... Marine has always been a popular alternative to Combat. People tend to use armor for the legendary effects they have... Defense stats usually come second.
---
That's on you then to put together your own team. You can join high level players and invite high level players.
---
Exactly! Love the whole post man. I knew the free week would bring a ton of this. I hope no balance changes come due to the free week.
---
I m sure ur the exception and not the norm lvl of someone who just started playing

Leatherworker has an incredibly low drop rate of death law hides. Can only be found in crates.

FO76 Final Raid Boss: Making Friends.
---
If on PC I'll sell mine.
---
I'd say that's within rules as well. Even though we can guess they are probably dupers fishing for the hot weapon type effect to mass produce. I'd still like a legendary fingerprint on ** &amp; *** items. Erase anything with the same fingerprint INCUDING the original. Don't leave them with a seed weapon to start all over.
---
I was just thinking about editing this. I need to be more specific I don't have  any friends that play this game . I would like to meet people in game randomly and be able to quickly and easily continue playing in a squad. Right now I would have to friend them they would have to accept it then I would have to message them to go to the main screen so we could Squad up. Not that it is impossible I just think it would be nice if it was a little easier.
---
I gave it another try, and it seemed somewhat  better,  but not amazing. I ran into a few more interesting things, met some people, etc.
---
From the description and past games I knew that. I just cant seem to ever catch it really working, which is why I stopped running it
---
that did used to be a glitch with marsupial and the boosted mutation in party perk, it was fun to fight scorchbeasts in the air with melee
---
The "physical copy" is not a disk, it is just a code. So just buy it and add the code.
---
I fully support a way to make Pre-War Money useful and this is great
---
I've been playing since the beta but my advice is, being well rested, do feed the people for canned meat stew, use butchers bounty and cool everything, take workshops for the easy initial gain plus the fairly easy defend events after.
---
Ooooooooooooooooooooohhh  
---
\*feels dumb\*
---
I agree with part of that, but if you're buying it on Reddit from a high karma user, there is a good chance it is not unique even if it wasn't mass duped. Not saying all high karma traders are dupers, but most eventually get the stuff.
---
Like most fictional media I wouldn't assume someone is dead unless you see their lifeless corpse. And even then sometimes they're not dead. She'll be involved in the Wastelanders DLC for sure.
---
Oooh! I’m not very good at combat. I’ve really like BR but basically just hide as much as I can and occasionally get a kill in but that got boring quickly. This would totally bring me back for more!
---
Nice.
---
I want to use purified water with cooking because I have around 95 purified water in my inventory, and I constantly check my purifiers (a habit I picked up when I started playing).
---
Don't feel dumb. I had to be told.
---
Jesus well like the person above said I’m just gonna server hop for the event I’m like 2 away for the armored backpack.
---
I started yesterday on the free trial and I'm having a blast. If any of you see me around (Sotalia), come say hi, I would love to team up with people.
---
Simple question with a simple answer, yes it can it gives you 750 radiation resistance so you take way less rads than you would normally...
---
I agree I suppose. In my experience, the best, and most unique items go very fast and typically very expensive. I browse the different markets often trying to get those golden posts, it’s definitely possible. I’ve gotten some of my most prized pieces of armor like this. It’s really skyrocketed a lot too since the new vendor came out, people have better luck than me I suppose
---
YES I'm so okay with this. Maybe some pre-recorded audio in between songs like 3 Dog. I'd turn into a 24/7 broadcast often for that (a new version for FO76, not the current 24/7 broadcasts)
---
Your individual loading time isn't affected by your camp size, this is true. But Bethesda has already said that it's a matter of having all of these camps across all of these servers sending and receiving information to and from the same lines of code. It's just too much to have implemented at once and still have the gameplay and framerates consumers expect.  It's easy for us to say what they can and can't add, without understanding the relative load on the game from the perspective of the devs. We're talking about having individual camps recreated on the fly to exact specifications of the player, at the same time as its loading everything else that's happened on that server. Even if they could get camps to function that way, it would effectively lessen the ability to accurately render anything else in the same way the game does now. Look at ARK or some of the other mmo betas (because this is still in beta tbh), and the differences between them and 76. The differences are what make 76 feel and look like the Fallout it desperately wants to be. Now I'm not saying its impossible,  not at all, only that Bethesda is never going to do that much. Look at their history with fixes and updates, eso and fallout 76 aside, they don't have a running fix service for their games, and eso is only just now at where it should have been at launch. 76 will follow the same story of half assed patches and nerfs till they finally figure out what the hell they're trying to do with it. Imho
---
Yeah I've been thinking about this alot and I assumed it was a simulation but the  way they talk about the storm makes it seem like it's supposed to be real which makes zero sense.
---
Yeah, that one always makes me laugh.
---
Dude, try paragraphs. I want to read it based on the beginning but you make it hard to read.
---
For an unfair advantage, this would be a disadvantage. You don't get anything for making your camp look better, just use more resources.
---
Scout Armor has higher ballistic DR than heavy BOS if modified to polymer and it is close on energy damage, so I guess it depends on how you define "best."
---
PC!
---
You r welcome
---
New fridge might be nice.
---
Played for awhile at launch, have been and am still excited to play this game down the road.  A bit more time though.
---
I spent 30 minutes doing a power plant daily, trying to find my way around the maze of a plant since it was my first time.
---
I finally get everything repaired, find the room with the console to restart it.  Then suddenly wham, my fourth server disconnect this week.
---
No xp, no rewards, nothing.  Just 30 minutes of my time and ammo completely wasted.
---
Masculine costumes. There's a lot of unisex ones or women's. But barely any masculine ones.
---
i suggested this at least 4 times now...they wont listen and a good amount of the player base will start to cry that the increase would unbalance the game. Others say just bulk your junk (as if i havent done it yet) and so on............  
---
i hope they will increase it, but i highly doubt they'll do
---
I havent seen it posted on here yet
---
I've had this happen to me too. I've noticed sometimes it will even say you leveled up even when there's no way you could have, like if you just leveled up and couldn't possibly get enough xp in that one game.
---
It's free to play for the next 4 days, so there's nothing to lose by trying it out. I ended up buying it after playing overnight.
---
M79 + Frog Legs
---
Thank you.

I got that weapon and I left behind my TSE Shotty build and instantly made a new one the second I got the Monster.

abandon quest and try again?

Why are you using stims in a fight anyway?

Dont rush the main quest. Many of the rewards are nice, but scale to your level when you do the quest. Wait till level 50+.
---
Do the reapeatables too
---
Make it something you can buy from personal terminal.
---
Tried it about 30 times doing it now currently actually
---
Hmm, sounds promising.  I always run into the issue of not doing enough damage with the M79 though.  Like, it takes more than one grenade to knock people.
---
I definitely agree with what you’re saying here. I’m absolutely loving this game mode.. also agree, the bugs are minimal and im impressed! Three things I thought would be nice would be a ping system, primarily for enemies.. if you could crawl when you’re downed soo that you don’t always get thirsted, and maybe a differentiating noise between enemy and friendly footsteps.. soo hard to tell them apart then bam someone rounds the corner and tears me apart with a 50. Cal lol. All and all though this has been a truly amazing battle royale experience. Soo much different then anything else I’ve played and I really can’t complain even if the things I mentioned never got changed!
---
I really, really need a pot or cauldron as a helmet, for my Cadwell from ESO cosplay.
---
If you're on PC I had the same freaking trouble. If you want to buy the game straight through Bethesda then click "learn more" on the launcher rather than "buy now". For some reason the buy now takes you to a place on their website to look for retailers but the learn more will take you directly to a page where you can easily purchase the game.
---
The current roadmap is only for the first 100 days, I'm sure a new one will be released once this round of content is completed!
---
True, but my guess is Zenimax wants to squeeze as much sales out of it first before handing a bit of the cookie to Valve. My guess is it will go to Steam after the summer, roughly a year after it first came out.
---
I haven’t played it NW but yes
---
Yeah i thought they will release it but I think it’s next Thursday
---
No venders? They seem to be taking up a heap.
---
Very small rocks!
---
Kinda like the demon vs Slayer they are bringing to Doom Eternal.
---
You find the 2 people that sniped each other yet?  Somewhere up north by steel plant I think.
---
Do the two daily ones too. They can drop badges as well. I've completed almost all the other ones. Tedious but not impossible.
---
Did they fix being able to stack this with 2* Good with Salt?
---
To comment on this. The fire goes out so ludicrously fast, with the enemies that it’s hard to hell to even figure out what that kindling looks like or where it is if you haven’t done the event tons.
---
I’d love to see some better weapon skins.. feel like they’ve been kind of underwhelming and not for many guns!
---
Whats your gt? I mainly use xbox but I'll grab it for PS4 character because I need a main weapon for him.
---
How much do you want for it
---
I mean you can pop behind a tree. Which during the death that made me post this I did. I tried to heal and reload, but the animation stopped my reload, and left me defenseless.
---
lol i have 2 buildings..1 garage 1 main house...not really a valid reason :D
---
The load times are ass and just because everyones in at the same time doesnt mean someone doesnt get to a gun before you
---
It never shows level on people who are lvl 0, it only starts showing level after you get Overseer rank 1 or higher.
---
Uhhh that’s not how it works lmao
---
Lead belly here. What are rare?
---
I love this idea. When I first started playing I thought I was just lousy at finding enough caps. Nope I know it's not just me who has trouble at those machines. 
---
Sounds like a good idea to me!
---
When did they say they were going to release it in a month or so.
---
While we're throwing out ideas, how about getting a slider to turn down/off the title screen and atomic shop music ):
---
whoops, 4 vending machines. knew I was forgetting something.
---
Yea no vats was a big surprise
---
Look, I know you work for Bethesda and all, but, I’m something of an expert at not killing other players, so, yeah... maybe you could learn a thing or two, just saying.
---
There have been so many times where I've had some little level 5 come along in my camp and kill my Brahmin and I'm just like ***so help me god if they make it so that puts a bounty on you, you'd be dead***
---
No offense but its just a "glorified" bloodied gauntlet, effects are average for me...
---
They look like one!!!
---
Damn that's crazy. How many stimpaks did she have?
---
It's basically Ring Of Elysium though
---
Things were... rough back then
---
I know right? The atom shop has so many great choices that are really worthwhile purchases, so the only real problem with it is checking what I actually have left to buy!
---
Not sure, kinda chaotic neutral
---
Got em lol, but yeah it's true also they are gonna be the next best thing once they fix the mods everyone is gonna want them...
---
The thing is you clearly don't understand sentinel and how it works stacked with the assassin effect.  Literally makes you indestructible by standing in one spot. That or you do get it. You get it and you think your hot shit because of you BFSS DCG and bullshit armor. All I want is equal opputunity for players. Take your shit some where else man
---
Yes you do
---
I'm on xbox, thanks anyway.
---
Great tips, thanks!
---
Had some great games today and ended my night with a 9 kill win as the last member of my team. Wiped out a whole 3 man squad and I can say exactly what made it happen.. stay in cover and plan.. I hid momentarily, equipped a few grenades and hit them by surprise. Quickly switched to my pipboy and popped about 4 chems. Ran out with the 50. Cal and tore those guys apart. This isn’t like your typical battle royale. It’s soo nice to see stealth and strategy be effectively implemented into this game mode. Honestly loving it soo much! Hope it doesn’t take long to return and a few small things are fixed for the better!
---
Ohh yeah I know i wasnt the only one lol... Yeah n i like to match sides up too in my inventory then i go back to the other side and it messes it all up
---
Goals
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yeah, it’s a bit strange how it works to be honest. But now with multiple modes available it does someone make sense to have the party setup at the main screen. Maybe. Hehe. 
---
Also if you add friends in adventure mode you get Atoms each time I think.
---
Pop a nukashine and have at it.
---
Imagine if it still a disappointment lol
---
If you own an item from the store then go over it in the store and “favourite” it, next time you play NW you should be wearing it.

---
Here's a guide to get you started. There are many locations a pet can spawn.
---
I'm typically not into the whole battle Royale thing. My personal belief is that Bethesda is staying too far from the expected gameplay that has made fallout an icon for many fans of the rpg/fps/adventure genre. Fallout has never been a fps quick match kind of game. It just isn't in the DNA. 
---
But considering that the br mode can last for 20 minutes after waiting 5 just to start a match, having something to do aside from just quitting after you get ko'd is something this mode needs.
---
I'm also not a fan of straying too far from the Canon for a game that is as lore rich as the series, but considering this is the way Bethesda seems to be hell bent on directing the series, this would at least give some of the non COD/fps fans something to do.
---
I'm not totally opposed to having a niche mode, but I am really concerned the IP of fallout in general is shifting towards a more casual main stream audience.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sc2xLsZbtE Here's a guide to get you started. There are many locations a pet can spawn.
---
I would like to nominate myself for these awards. I only keep my hair the freshest with my clean toilet bowl water.
---
A vault tec expirement actually
---
I've been having problems with it too. I'll get the misc quest to talk to the robot then it disappears entirely
---
Cool thank you, if people wanted to can they kill my pets? I only ask cause of the few “lovely” people at the bottom of this thread.
---
Oh man, can so relate!  I suck without VATS, though I have managed to kill the odd player before getting killed myself lol.
---
All I see is scrip fodder! Seriously though, do you have a sensible build that uses wood armor?
---
Perfection.
---
100% agree, want it so bad
---
Probably because all the overload on servers because of the free week
---
They can yes, unfortunately. Your pets can die if random npcs attack your camp, and the pet can outright die from seemingly nothing. Haven't had a pet more than a few days.
---
Haven't used these thing even once in nearly 300 hours. This is a great idea.
---
I scored one from a vending machine, though that might be harder now with folks busy with NW.
---
Sadly no.
---
Oh man that kinda stinks, well it is the wasteland after all I guess.
---
So... don't give people incentive to play, because it will tempt them to cheat?  
---
Why stop at Atoms, why not remove the cosmetics, people might wanna cheat to get those, no?   And while we're at it, I like getting new perks; how about we remove the perks so people don't cheat to get them? OH, and the new story content that's locked behind overseer levels, we should scrap that, otherwise we're gonna have people cheating to unlock the terminals.
---
And don't get me started on Wastelanders, they should drop that altogether; it'd suck if the game was ruined by all the cheaters in brings in...
---
Are they continuing the Survival mode lengendary unlocks after this week, or can I look forward to never having to enter a survival lobby again?
---
Good luck with that man the nuke silos are no joke
---
Isn't that just the fiberglass variant?
---
Yeah, just saw that. Good to know, thanks!
---
Thank you Valseek, today Ive played for the first time with zero disconnection. Thank you all for the support!

This post is 5 months old but you just saved me from having to follow my friends to use their bases. My down arrow key is broken so I couldn't build.

thx op
---
They couldn't be traded, it was illegal.
---
It's about time I get what I paid for a year ago.......
---
That's understandable. If only Bethesda listened to suggestions 😔
---
Did pipe revolvers get added to the legendary table?
---
Yeah that makes logical sense.  Wonder if all platforms have it as bad as each other.
---
Craft Plasma Grenades.
---
I hate it when people say "use a microphone" i have a loud window ac in my room and i just get told to mute my mic because of the noise. I cant win lol
---
He was probably using Cheat Engine, and he set the value of whatever the game uses to determine if the player is live or not to 1 or True (eg. #alive = True), so that no matter how much damage he took (as HP would oc have a separate value), he never died.

IKR, they should totally add a game mode where everyone wins; god mode for everyone, no weapons, no fighting we all just prance merrily in the woods waiting for the timer to... NO TIMERS, you can stay as long as you want!
---
Or....I shoot bugs from the roof while you do the manual labor. If i have a ts tesla that can wipe out everything, im not on log duty.

It used to be fun trying to survive at the golf course when 1000s of them were spawning all the time.
---
Yea, I watched the floater destroy an entire pub last night.  It was hilarious, and I hope they get banned.

Discover locales in the Savage Divide. (stuck at 4/5)

There is literally a person in this thread that posted a comment telling them to kill themselves over it.
---
It's not for everyone sorry you didn't want to stay with us in Appalachia come back and visit sometime pal happy gaming!
---
whats wrong with the mods? i modded all my pieces to polymer and deep pockets.mind you it took a while to find the right mods..like which ones are limbs and which one are chest..

So then outline how the extra stuff to render isn't going to end up causing problems if everyone's (already large and intricate) camps suddenly grow 50%.
---
I have a two story hotel, with bar, store, vendors, individual furnished rooms, a smoking room, reception, two outdoor decks and small farm. And the store has shelves with plushies/globes/etc on them...     
---
I'd like more to work with too. But seriously, how much will be enough in a world with limited console rendering and memory constraints.

Harvest different herbs (stuck at 11/12)
---
Haha you idiot, that’s not how it works. 
---
1. All of that gear you mentioned, only has a 75% to work. Each piece, so you’ll always be resisting some, but you won’t be resisting all, all the time.
---
2. Dmg Reduction by %’s is always a depreciating value. It’s not *X - 75%* its (((((X - 15%)-15%)-15%)-15%)-15%) so you really don’t know how it works.
---
3. I’ve never been Bloodied, and melee weapons are at a massive disadvantage against god-tier armor but I’m still a melee player. But crits go through all of that armor regardless. And I haven’t even mentioned staggers
---
It does not “literally make you incredible.” 
---
Quit being a whiney baby and just play the game better. You’d be better off asking for tips and learning how to get better than going on here and demanding all of the players that have played for a long time be brought to your level. 40% of the players in this game have played since BETA, and if you haven’t played that long, you probably won’t be as well equipped or skilled.
---
&gt; make the mutation worth looking at for more than a second
---
I admit your suggestion would be cool, but the Carnivore is pretty awesome as is; with Cannibal and Lead Belly it's you're near filled up on a single corpse with no downsides whatsoever, and even without them it's still crazy good, the no herb rule is near meaningless considering how often you get meat, and the 2x bonus and 0% disease chance is amazing.
---
Harvest Fungi, Plants &amp; Nuked Flora. (stuck at 9/10)
---
they will probably slap a [prototype] all over the armors and made it plans-only like the X-01, not from world drops
---
I understand that treatment for the X-02, but the X-03? shessh, they better come up with a solid retcon, because this is the T-60 all over again.
---
Ya but why not risk it if you have excess stims? There's no guarantee the enemy will hit, especially on console.
---
They did indeed
---
Takes 2 for me, but with frog legs, I don’t get hit at all. Combining with heavy gunner reload, grenadier and demo is ideal.

You're fine with all the video game murder, but the video game meat eating is a step too far?
---
Usually if I go to a camp with powered vending machines and they either have nothing in them or take 10 minutes to find, then I can't guarantee the life expectancy of your brahmin. Seriously people if you want people to buy your stuff, don't hide your vending machines and actually stock them.
---
Yeah, I heard rumours, but nobody seems to know the details. Do tell :)
---
Have fun with other games! Depending on your platform, if you want to give it a go again, my squad and I will help power you up and you’ll have a good time running a survival server with us!
---
Bye! Good luck!
---
A mutant costume, a scorched costume, a mole man costume. A yowie suit. Every type of hat you can think of. A unlimited supply of paint to paint everything I own including structures. A NPC, that I can have in my camp the talks to me and I can task like crafting items.
---
I may in the future, but I'm gonna take a big break from multiplayer for now. Thanks for the offer.
---
yeh you can get from Hack able Terminals in NW.
---
its a bloody op as weapon atm.
---
Boxing ring is coming. Saw a datamined atom shop post when the update initially came out that showed it in there as an item for purchase probably next week? Or maybe when they eventually release NW
---
If you’re on Xbox and bored, hmu sometime, we always playing. GT:Rocky Two Milli
---
Upvoted, because it seems like these are half of the camps with powered vending machines.
---
Psn is ascarin1988, euhm make me an offer?
---
I agree, but just keep in mind through in game lore and stuff in fallouts, 30 dollars isn't much. A burger costs like 45 dollars lol.
---
Two times its happened on both my character's now i just have empty vending machines
---
really enjoyed your story
---
That would make the match's shorter though.
---
I have the perk card for heavy guns and it doesn’t feel too OP.
---
20% to all sources of xp
---
Funny you ask what's wrong with the mods then you answer your on question...
---
ive seen them outside of my camp every now and then, they get harpooned and feasted on
---
the game took a big perfomance hit with the NW patch, I'm getting like 35-50fps AVERAGE with a GTX 1080 on 1080p, pre patch I was getting (almost) rock solid 60-80fps ,and like you said, the CTD are back with a vengeance.
---
I understand the manouver of the free week and the sneak peek of the BR mode, but damn, the perfomance took a big hit :(
---
Considering how much atom you get for doing daily and weekly tasks, it's literally just a gameplay loop, not a hardcore cash grab. It's the equivalent of grinding for cosmetics in destiny and nobody seems to be complaining over there.
---
Up from whitespring bunker entrance
---
Stop it, I need a photo so I can finish this stupid mammologist badge.
---
i just thought thats the way iys meant to be..so thats the only problem? not really a big problem considering the mods are cheap to buy..just keep buyin till u find the right one

---
I dont have many caps on my PS4 so you have to tell me how much you want so I can try and get them as fast as I can
---
Okay thank you very much, I've been running around the vault like a jackass trying to find crafting stations or anything of the sort
---
Guess I'll hang out there tomorrow. Thanks!
---
Yes.. However i wouldn't expect it till late this year. After this wave of dlc gets added
---
I understand and accept that some folks like double xp, but is there a way to turn it off if I don't want it?
---
I think his point was that cheaters in pvp ruin the game for everybody in it, which is especially frustrating in a battle royale where you can spend half an hour to die unfairly. In PvE, all they are doing is ruining it for themselves.
---
Mmm give me the 5 star legendaries. Or legendary level ups
---
They regularly spawn on top of the Enclave bunker. If you walk directly from standing on top of the bunker to the white spring station, you’ll almost certainly spot one. 
---
And if it’s for the scout challenge, you can shoot it and then take a picture.
---
3k sounds good to you?
---
There is one in the grassy park area between the main entrance of whitesprings and the parking area near the laundry mat. Almost always see one there.
---
Don’t you see how you’re part of the problem?
---
You can put a waypoint on the map and your team mates can see it. Clunky but that's all we can do so far.
---
Its an online game. Someone prob triggerd them being near a high lvl. Then ran away. Lol i spent a lot of time just sprinting down roads when i would get one on me.
---
That should not be the case all the time and if it is... I'd move but thats just me.
---
Thank you, yeah that's how I got my fox photo. Still have it in my library.   😂
---
An hour long battle royale with strong ass enemies, diseases and fast full sized nukes (like 10 seconds from warning to drop) would be Fucking sick as HELL
---
Thats fine. I'll hop on tonight and get the caps and tomorrow, I'll buy it. Thanks
---
Have a good done, hope you come back one day. :)
---
Yes, this has been my experience on PC.
---
Thank you, I'll try there too.
---
Yeah.  I cleaned up a match and won with it.  I am in awe of how OP it is.
---
We need it in all modes ffs. Damn streamers raised a bunch of shit about push to talk and they got in a month.
---
Ok that's good for me, just metion the gauntlet in the friend request if you want.
---
Well, the lowest scorchbeasts are level 50, and most areas outside of the forest are rated for higher levels than 26 so...
---
The pre war money idea is marvelous, seriously before 76 I made sure to keep all of my pre war cash because in some games it was worth more than caps I'd just trade said amount for the item I wanted  without spending a single cap
---
Very annoying.   I noticed the same thing
---
Oh no put it back.
---
Which means you could get more matches in once you die.
---
Thanks
---
This!
---
Hmm, good to know.  I’ll have to try to get RNGeezus to bless me.
---
Suppress your mutations with rad-x, and the chance of getting the disease in general is super low, so it can literally take minutes of the damn thing hitting you over and over to get it. They do specifically have to be "Diseased".
---
Thanks, I really appreciate the response.
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Instead of that little path between buildings go around to the grassy area. I think there is a bench and a lunchbox there.
---
I think you have to have seen them in your weapons range
---
The plans are a drop from the arktos event. Some folks are selling diffusers at their vendors
---
r/unexpectedwarframe
---
Because with a melee I can't see them until I'm right on them on my compass
---
yeah people where calling out for this and for ghoulification ever since launch i think its would be very cool too but balancing it would be hard
---
Oh, a picnic while I wait, good idea!
---
Or better yet another idea it’s a complete solo game mode the sole survivor.
---
&gt; Removing these posts decreases visibility on an extremely important subject, and we don’t want that at all.
---
Then how about this crazy idea, stop knee jerk deleting entire posts on the subject regardless of their actual content?  I posted my experience with someone flying through the air and under the map auto aiming at everyone in range and didn't explicitly name names here but hadn't censored their name in the video links.  Whatever mod took the time to go in and delete just the text of my post but leave the thread intact to die with no context outside of the title could have just as easily removed only the offending links while allowing the discussion to continue.
---
Or if we need a better example of how the mods here are overreaching and overreacting I could just share my experience from this morning concerning my literally theoretical friend "SuperhackerA" who briefly got me a thirty day suspension from the sub.
---
Okay, I will, thanks!
---
Yes, caps for kills, xp for time, both for wins
---
I just won my first game and I didn't fire a single shot. My team got wiped out the first 2 minutes and I just stayed in the bushes on the edge of the fire and at the end  bunch of people died in the fire and I won. I constantly get top 5 without firing a shot.
---
and i hate it. it‘s not showing the game in the best light either
---
Dude...
---
That would be logical. Logic is not allowed in the Bethesda studio.
---
 Nah, the blackbird is a nod to the SR-71 Blackbird, a legendary plane.
---
Thomas Edison would like a word with you....
---
It is worth it enough for nuke zones, but there is a bug with wearing a bandana and power armour plus lead lined back pack = no radiation. Depends on how often you need to heal and how often you eat, I switched completely to herbivore
---
Yeah, I got two friends to try it and they have CTD multiple times in just two days.
---
Ahhh interesting. So if I have a sniper equipped it’s more likely enemies will show up on my compass? I’ll have to test this out.
---
I've seen plenty at the Savage Divide.
---
I think it's to avoid too much power disparity. Another solution is to allow the creation of perk load outs so you can swap them easily.
---
Dammit there is some really cool shit there...
---
Yesterday i made 4 sets of heavy combat armor fully moded it with BOS, ultralight. 4x The fixer, 2xsemi .45, 2x auto .38. Fully moded, 4x shielded vault tec underarmor, 4x combat armor helmet with bos paints. I found a group of 3 guys .. lvl19,21,21. Man they ran away when they saw me in my black T60 so i kept spaming hearth emote.. they were soo happy when i gave them stuff.. i gave everyone 4k ammo for their weapon and fast traveled away.. told them to enjoi the game.
---
I was thinking about experimenting and building some pop up structures for use in different scenarios while I screw around in adventure mode. I was discovered a few things recently that might help turn a battle for me.
---
I've played this almost every day since launch day. I had about 900 hours in on FO4, so I really wanted to give it a chance. Yes, things were buggy in the beginning, but I can see that they tried really hard to make this a great game. I've had a ton of fun, and there are some really great players out there. -mroboto
---
What if they gave these points every 5 levels like perk card packs? Don't let my dream die
---
*coughs* Anti-raider rules *cough*
---
I have that list.  Got it from a body tied to 51 that's been in the game already for a few weeks
---
I've found even just a foundation with 1-2 walls can bait players while I sit behind a tree a distance away and they'll run right up to the structure and give me an opportunity to take them out.
---
Pete Hines is a great guy. I really like him.
---
Actually I'm a level 87 and I have trouble getting enough junk as is. You shouldn't assume how much someone has based on their levels.
---
I agree I know it's to balance the in game economy but I think it's pointless alot of players by now have more than 15 to 20k on them and I'm here with like 4k
---
Yea this should definitely be a thing. And anyone who just wings it and dies early on never spectates until the end anyhow. I’ve also went down in the final 10 and had my team win a few times so I feel you on that.
---
 This is awesome, thanks! Hopefully our levels carry over to the full release.
---
"The Bethesda reps revealed human interaction with a clear dialog tree"
---
You mean like every other Fallout?
---
Wish the same thing man, cross platform so I can come by every time. All the best wishes to OP.
---
i have 20k every three days, it‘s insane. i could have more if it wasn‘t for this shitty tax system which takes 250c from every 2.5k sale away. 
---
what are you selling at your vendors? i have a bit of EVERYTHING and it‘s always booming. the vendor bots get 1.4k per day aswell, it‘s not that hard to sell your junk every day. :)
---
That small donation helps to feed and shelter a scared and hungry deathclaw. Everyday dozens of deathclaws are brutally killed for sport. For less than the cost of 4 nuka quantums a hour you can preserve their natural habit while protecting them from wasteful vaulties and ensure that future generations will be able to witness their beauty.
---
Maybe scale budget to level (to a point)?
---
That's what I thought we were getting at launch.  Instead we got gimped CAMP building.  I've build 20 story skyscrapers in the Murkwater Construction Site (fun to jump off the roof).  Incredible modern lofts on the beach in Far Harbor with angler plants casting a nice glow over tidal pools... In FO76, the entire build mechanic fights you every step.
---
Is this like asking for spoilers? Because you definitely find out as you unlock holotapes and terminals in vault 51
---
I get the grind blues. I basically gave up on the storyline and just went to do fun events and explore. Then I got a decent gun and it all started working better. I just hit 50 with my main character. 
---
What other games are you interested in? (If you don't mind my asking)
---
Yeah, I'm often in situations where there's so much background noise my team can't understand me.
---
I have a little bit of everything at my camp from plans to ammo to junk I'm lacking weapons and armor tbh I haven't found some interesting weapons people would buy plus it probably doesn't help that I'm on super late when I get off work where it's less populated on the server
---
PC? Aside from the PlayStation network being down for several hours today it’s been really good this week. It’s weird to me how much variance there is between platforms and stability. Sucks with all the newbs playing this week
---
I've known about this "bug" for crops for about a month or so. There are also a few other very small but  cosmetic bugs like this I simply don't want to tell anyone about in fear that it'll get fixed... 
---
For example, if you've clipped about 10 to 20% of a foundation into a cliff side, you typically can't get a full wall to place into the clipped area, but you can get half walls to place where full walls normally wouldn't Full walls. Half walls have greater clipping potential than full walls for whatever reason.
---
Check player vending machines.  I came across the one I got that way. Good price as well. Keep your eyes open and visit ones with weapons.
---
Scaring the new people is so fun. I decided to be a sheepsquatch and lurked in the shadows (while crouching so they don't see my name)  and then following them everywhere. It's really fun when a new person above level 5 hits you though. They got to learn somehow?
---
It's good to drop something you're not having fun with! I hope you have a good time else where then friend! &lt;3
---
Well its simple really, its 50 because they.....you see if you carry the 4 and multiply it by the amount of perks available you get....so 50 is the most logical choice because its an even number and.....look, 50 is the greatest number ever made and the largest. end of discussion!
---
This inferno paints look like they’ll be great for Raider players when Wastelanders comes out.
---
I've played all the modern fallouts through a few times, I occasionally play multiplayer games like Minecraft, CS and R6. But RPGs are my bread and butter, I haven't found a good rpg that I won't play at least once. (excluding jrpgs, too long for me.)
---
Me three.
---
Thanks for responding, I really appreciate how nice most of this community is.
---
YES... I want the entire glass building set.  That was my core building material.  A 4 story floor to ceiling glass wall in my living room facing the sunset would be awesome.  Glass railings around stairs or balconies so you don't fall three stories by accident.  It would be nice to have lighted floors and ceilings like in FO4 too... Used that A LOT.
---
you have to have the 2 melee mutations to make it shine
---
I've heard it as being overpowered at high levels, but that also could have been patched out.....
---
I bet you work for Bethesda
---
You’re allowed to build camps in NW with blueprints from Adventure mode.0
---
I had ghouls do that same in the same area
---
I've got one I'd sell. I've seen them going around 5k in the marketplace. So I'd like something around there
---
They're invisible(-ish) if they're stationary and have a piece of Chameleon armor, which they probably do. The bushes in Fallout are pretty good cover too though.
---
PC?
---
Cool! Remember to post pictures once it arrives.
---
P
---
Just got my tracking order, should be here in a week.
---
No problem, depending on what platform you’re on you should just need to press A (Xbox) or X (PS4) on whatever item you want to use and it will put a little Nuclear Bomb symbol on it and you’re good to go
---
I would be honored to come by and pay my respects. What's your gamer tag?
---
I agree with everything stated here.
---
What an amazing reason.
---
It's the most powerful if you don't use PA. Make sure you have both talons and twisted musles. For perks, iron fist, incisor, martial artist  and bloody mess to max out your damage. With all of that, you can one-hit any common infantry with an instigating or bloodied Powerfist/DCG.
---
You joke. But as a construction worker we do have explosive nails. You take a special hammer and nail. It's got a charge equivalent to a 22. And when you smack it it drives the nail into concrete
---
Right now there's one positive and one negative thread on the hot fallout 76 page as well as a few not popular question posts about the game. That's it. I wouldn't call that a "full 180" whatsoever especially as that sub had basically forgotten about the game mostly before E3. No matter how bad or wrong something is you eventually just get tired of talking about it. That has nothing to do with the game's state itself. 
---
Fallout 76 also did not just add a beta mode what? It's a free trial nothing else with a test run, I wouldn't even define it as a beta, of the BR mode. But the full game is merely on a free trial. 
---
Also can you please link to official conformation there was never a trade stealing bug? Because I don't ever recall seeing such a thing quite the opposite I thought I read something from Bethesda about it being looked into. However I could be wrong on that I'll fully admit. 
---
But that's just one small instance and example out of many, manyyyy bugs and issues so that's not saying much. 
---
Again I think it's incredibly stupid to try to pass off all of the very legitimate criticism of the game as "lulz h8ters just h8ting cuz its cOOl" especially as criticism is HEALTHY and GOOD for anything, especially a product and video game. 
---
I'm really not sure why some of the people here are so offended that people have some issues with their clearly favourite game. It's like anyone who says anything bad about the game ran over your cat or something it's pretty sad how some very...dedicated players respond to it.
---
Do you really need a detailed reason?
---
It happened to me too, double check your inventory. It was visible on the ground for me but in my actual inventory.
---
Still waiting to hear about mine
---
That's like saying you can store boiled water in a fridge to make pasta
---
wow that’s pretty cool, and handy.
---
Yep its there, thanks!  What a weird bug
---
A little elaboration would be nice.
---
Maybe even just a "I think bethesda should remove stealthboy cos its poopy"
---
My game crashes everytime I talk to her. Just started side quests instead.
---
No  duplicate/rng perk cards! How can this be a competitive mode?
---
The ramp foundation is literally 1 half wall high. Just snap a ramp somewhere on the lower level and get a foundation where you want it while extending it off that ramp. You can then place concrete or wooden stairs that clip right through foundations without issue. After that you can just remove the ramp. 
---
If you want to raise or lower foundations without ramps, you first need to place your floor of foundations, pick what foundation you want to change the height of, and then remove the adjacent foundations (add them back later) to prevent it from snapping. Something about the build menu controls that a lot of people don't know about is that you can raise and lower objects on the Z axis. For PS4, holding L1 or R1 will move the object vertically without changing the X and Y position of the object (which allows it to stay in the exact same spot and not collide with other foundations). I imagine it's LB and RB for Xbox. For PC... I have no idea.
---
Yeah I got it, I just got the E3 exclusive pack and wanted to show off my Elders Battlecoat lol
---
It's a skin: "Feed the flames with Power Armor Hellfire paint!  This is a unique skin that completely alters the appearance of your Power Armor, and can be equipped to all Power Armors."
---
the glass cannon bloodied build is what a lot of people use
---
Dude I've been trying for months now around 1 month after game release
---
I'm pretty sure you can hear enemy players emote, but not see the emote.
---
Brutal. Hope you get it figured out!
---
So the "crowd of babies online" don't have an opinion then? Anyone that says anything bad about 76 or something you like is just a hive mind without any ability to think for themselves because you said so? 
---
Are you saying the millions of people online and on the street right now protesting in and for Hong Kong are just a "crowd of babies online that want to complain about everything" because that's a massive "bandwagon" as you'd call it "hating" on something? That's what you're saying right? Or is that okay in that instance because you'd support that?
---
Haha Nice one, I got that too as soon as I seen it, pretty sweet coat.
---
Tnx but they aren't helpful
---
Scorchbeasts like to patrol that ridge to the west of Whitesprings. Probably not a great place to put a camp unless you're farming them.
---
If someone enters and penetrates your base you can move it and it will remove all the structures associated with the old base.
---
Nearly everyone serious runs bloodied, I run a full health build but that’s a good general rule. 
---
If you’re interested in being a full health build, I would go for AA and vats crits, and a executioners Gamma Gun for the bloodied folk.
---
And Tesla Rifle is king
---
I was worried this was going to happen.  I assume BSG increased server capacity for this free trial, but maybe they weren't expecting the sheer number of new players?  I quit playing last night (never really s got started) when I was booted from server twice in a row spawning into the game.  I'd also get hard freezing using my PIP boy, crafting bench, or simply being in-world walking around.  This required me to log out/log in to Windows to unfreeze the game and relaunch.  First impressions are important and if new player get frozen or kicked every 30 mins... it's not going to bode well for keeping trial members interested in the game.
---
So at launch anyone who criticized the game only did so because they were still mad that it wasnt fallout 5 or had multiplayer and the games launch was flawless and the game was in a 100% perfect state and was the best thing since sliced bread then? That's what you're saying? 
---
Also if the youtubers boycotted the game how did they also manage to put up lots of "hate" videos on the game that everyone just "followed" as you people claim? How can you boycott something if you post about it??
---
Excellent. Thanks for sharing the info. Where did you find it?
---
Agreed what system you on i might be able to get brain bombs recipe for you if on Xbox
---
Would help to add which platform and timezone you are playing...
---
It breaks the game, completely invisible people running around firing at you and your team.
---
If you have one in the end of the match, you've pretty much guaranteed you've won the entire game.
---
There is no item / perk that counters it.
---
i used to have the mutations that increased dmg at lower health, ill probably join in on a bloodied build aswell, thank you!
---
lol yeah I pissed off a PUBG or Fortnite player because it just lost a vote oh well I know it isn't popular opinion to not like these game modes but whatever my opinion stands it isn't for me and holds 0 value to a adventure mode player the same way fortnites BR mode holds no value to a Save the world mode player.
---
Hell yeah lol
---
I just want a different inventory system for it.
---
Wait... 
---
.44 bull barrel and radium rifle glow sight...
---
Are these available in adventure? I was looking for years.
---
1. Omg I hadn't the critical thinking to know how sentinel worked although I'm staring at a piece as we speak. 
---
I'll just stop right there I really don't feel like going back and forth. I've literally never played a game of survival. But if you think running around with a melee CRIT vats someone makes you "good" this is really a sad situation. Survival is broken. The only reason it hasn't been revamped YET is because they're focusing on other things. I'm very well equiped but I'm not dealing with getting spawn killed at....dude fuck it think what you want. Even if I had a sentinel set to go with all my BE shit I wouldn't play because it's not a very competitively fair environment. NW is on the right track.
---
Can you still dupe it when it's on the ground like this? I thought they patched non bagged items ages ago.
---
I'm on Xbox yeah
---
I think that is the correct way to approach it. It seems a lot of people are enjoying the mode,including myself. There is more to Nuclear Winter than just the BR, as shown on the roadmap. Nuclear Winter just also happens to be the name of the game mode as well. As long as Bethesda doesn’t take the BRs success as sign that we want more pvp focused updates, I think we’ll be good. The future is looking bright in my opinion, we have human NPCs coming in the future as well many other updates that will cater to the more hardcore fanbase.
---
When you unlock these items in Nuclear Winter by gaining Overseer XP levels, they will appear as owned for you in the Atomic Shop. That description is the Atomic Shop description that accompanies the Hellfire paint.
---
People are way too sensitive these days. Though a plush bear riding a motorcycle might be “cuter”, and might be better for this day and age. Though way more messed up scenes exist in this game, and the ones before it.
---
Meh, wider audience, more people offended. Back in the day, it could have been a half-rotted, radioactive corpse and people would have been fine with it. But, you’ve gotta happy-up the game to sell more copies. I think the happy stuff (aka vault boy and American commercialism) contrasting the really dark, depressing stuff, being used as a satirical device, is totally lost on the younger kids playing this game. And probably most parents glancing at the cover of the game box.
---
Note: This is not a game for younger kids... “parents”...please stop letting them play it.
---
🤣
---
Yet you still took the time to write out a fairly length comment in full defence of the game and it's state? So clearly you don't I guess? Or how hard would it be to say "I expected imperfections but it's still not okay they're there" or something? Defends the game to an extent but still can be read pushing Bethesda to actually go up instead of just sideways in their game making.
---
The rule of thumb states you’re allowed to beat women with a stick that is not at thick as your thumb.  That’s basically the same thing as shooting a mini nuke at her corpse.
---
yeah, PC. i heard xbox players are having problems aswell, but not as frequently as us. nothing against new players, honestly, but i can‘t wait for this week to be over. 
---
WoW system is much better balanced: play for free until you‘re level 10 or smth. makes much more sense
---
My issue is I out survive my team to end up with a 2 V 1 in the finale of the NW round only to get killed and get around 660 XP and 39 caps.....39 caps for placing seconds are you serious? lol
---
Unless you want to put a certain roof over the stairs, or certain walls near the stairs, or if you happen to remove a wall to place a different kind there but find out that now that wall would be floating whereas before it was snapping to the stairs just fine, or if you want to place something below the stairs but instead they wind up at the top of the stairs or even on the roof that maybe you were able to place, or if you place something wrong upstairs and need to remove it, but now it's somehow a critical part off the structure and you can't remove it, or the stairs...
---
Those 2x1's are arguably the buggiest items in the game. Every single thing I said above is a legitimate bug that occurs with those stairs that I have personally experienced.
---
They don't price match competitors any more. But they still price match their website if it's sold and shipped by [walmart.com](https://walmart.com), in stock and not sold by some 3rd party vendor.
---
if that was the case, take 20% instead of 10 &lt;3
---
Good thinking. Some people are too curious. However I did notice some people building a larger structure one time and it was hard to get a bead on them. I suppose you would have to coordinate with teammates so you don't get trapped inside your own building.
---
Yeah well if you expect everyone to have equal chance of  killing everyone at any given moment then this game will be nothing else but a battle royale like Fortnite. Grinding and getting better is an essential aspect of this game and that’s why many people who like PvP chose FO76 over your typical battle royale game. 
---
The solution I proposed is perfect in terms of risk/reward and balance. You are still willing to play fallout in the classical way of collecting stuff and hunting legendaries but it’s up to you if you want to use and it risk to lose it. Even the best player with the best gear ever will eventually die one day, he will lose his shit and he won’t have the god monopoly forever.
---
Yeah none of the things worked. Still having issues.
---
i just sell everything that‘s more than 1*. and it has to be max level. 2* armors for 299c are booming
---
I've rolled back until November already. Still having issues. RMA time?
---
they aint based on american militias which tend on the far right wing, but on union strikers and such, their closest thing the uniformity is how common they use blue collar outfits.
---
Can I upvote twice?
---
thanks for the images, i have a question, do the power armor skins inly apply to a certain power armor or will they work with any? like the pink sprinkles one, could i use it with any power armor?
---
how do i equip level 3 perk cards if my character is a new character with level one everything?? i cant use my older high level character right? i dont get it someone pls help...
---
Ah cool. Have you found any images of the paints on other Power armor? Like Outcast on T-45d?
---
I'll keep that noted what about the 3 star weapons and legendarys
---
I haven't tried the mode yet as I'm not super interested in pvp, but I've always loved the hellfire armor so does anyone have a rough estimate on how long it'd take me to rank up enough to get it?
---
I'm willing to put in time but i always like an estimate, even if a very rough one.
---
Oh I wasn't doubting you nor denying their inherently insane bugginess. I just like the idea of the closest approximation we have to an actual staircase.
---
I use reversed brick walls which work for part of the wide side, so I just do those all as standard interior brick. Annoying but it works.
---
Sorry don't have a helpful suggestion, just wanted to say I'm having the same problem
---
I've tried the email thing and never recieve an email but I know they have the right one bc I get promotional emails from them all the time
---
It's been super frustrating!  
---
Hope you guys get it worked out :)
---
It works for me - there is no audio cue but your AP will refill to max if it procs on a kill.
---
Nah, took me a couple tics, too. Then on my like 3rd NW session I saw it pop up in the corner and was like, ooooohhh.
---
Being a greifer sack of shit is a game mechanic there, I know.
---
I just wish they’d get rid of that leaderboard I don’t want to be constantly hunted by level 200 players I know I’m going to lose instantly against
---
With. Without Green Thumb you’d snag 2 plants per pick.
---
Only..and here's the thing. Just because you CAN be a murderous, thieving sack of shit, in the game, doesn't mean you HAVE to be.
---
Reddit never gets rid of annnything dude.
---
Yes. And I've gathered that, and I cannot feed the fire.
---
Nope.
---
Some others to look out for include:   
---
Ballistic Fiber
---
Excess adhesive
---
Lead
---
Molded Plastic
---
Waste Acid
---
depends on the prefix and levels. check fo76market to see what prefixes are popular, for example bloodied, two shot, explosives. i sell a ghoul slayer‘s max level 3* death tambo for 999c bc melee, and if it was ranged i‘d go with something like 2-3k. some of the market prices are CRAZY, so don‘t get inspired by those. just go on there to see what‘s popular and the rest will sell by itself.
---
Yup. I've picked up kindling.
---
Lmao, loser. 
---
You’re full of it
---
You should submit a ticket.
---
I bought the Combat Ops underarmor forever ago, but I’m not allowed to favorite it for NW. Does it only work for some armor?
---
Fuuck that noise. "have you ran as administrator? I see that your CPU is 50mhz bellow the recommended stats, that's your problem". The report system is a fucking _joke_.
---
I feel you, lol. I only play the mode with friends in moderation, but when I do I have a good time. At least we are able to get some form of compensation for our normal characters, if we didn’t I don’t know if we’d play the mode as much as we do, though some of the NW rewards for leveling up are pretty cool.
---
Thanks, I'm still not used to some of the hate, it's weird.
---
Yeah. I would play it. We now have NW for real pvp
---
Nuclear winter.
---
That's cool.  When the outrage over repair kits was hot (I was one of the 'outraged') no one knew NW was coming.  But since it's so chaotic and weapons and stuff are all over the place, I can see where kits won't make or break this mode.  It might win you a match under the right circumstances, but it's not like repair kit purchasers will dominate the boards.
---
Yeah. I'm honestly not sure what about 50gb of that is.
---
It’s not supposed to go free to play
---
PvE or PvP?
---
I still want better BIGGER preview photos, and a way to protect from accidental purchases when you're just trying to preview the damn item.
---
Maybe, I mean yeah it's a surefire sign that it's your video card having issues, it could be non-software related, personally I would try re-seating the card, take it completely out of the case, maybe make sure the fans aren't too dusty, and re-seat it and see if it happens again
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNJNvZ3RtyI
---
There's a video of an example of someone's GPU crashing and failing to recover, if this is exactly what's happening to you then you should re-seat the card ASAP, if re-seating and trying different drivers doesn't work, it's time to replace the card :(
---
Some days when I’m bored I just get on the rooftop and kill them   Disappointed that the Gardner bots and doorman bots don’t give you anything. But a fun way to burn up ammo that I don’t use on character
---
Hate to hear that you have the same problem but hopefully we can all be playing soon! Will make a new email tomorrow I guess if nothing else works.
---
I just made 200 caps selling recipes at my vendor in adventure mode....the NW payouts are so small they are pathetic THANK god next week is double XP lol.
---
So you are saying you are the Tribute who just hid the whole time?
---
I do think 1000 is a good number to round it out to.
---
I'd like them to fix the perk awards. If you get to many duplicates and no useful perks you're just hosed. I'm level 16 and i've gotten 5 f-ing duplicates.  
---
Meanwhile people running around with master commando, master rifleman can 1 shot or 1 burst fire me.
---
Its still super fun.
---
It apparently only works with overarmor cosmetics, makes sense considering the Vault 51 theme and all
---
If you do go unyielding armor and nerd rage. All synergise together to make uber dps. And pro tip if your playing survival... Put on fireproof. Nuka mine to the face is my go to when bloodied builds wont leave me alone! Not sure if it helps enough for that big of a blast but it does seem to keep them alive with a regular mine.
---
sounds good.
---
So what you’re saying is... I should start stockpiling pre-war money. Got it! 
---
At the very least maybe I can fill a bathtub with it when putting items on display at camps becomes a thing.
---
You literally went through my profile looking for my GT and I'm the looser? Again. Never played survival and you're forever a button smasher. Probably crouched behind the vault giggling to yourself with your piss jug against that stack of books. Top one reads Building Thumb Strength 101.
---
they might, but you still have a stealthboy active until you find something......so just run the other way and they wont be able to get you.
---
Load times only arse* if you dont have an ssd.......
---
Wtf are you even talking about lmao?
---
Which will end in bans on their actual accounts, because they'll feel secure, just like the dupers did. They're never going to be able to stop day-1 hacking, so why not host a free week, quietly patch all the exploit horseshit you can find, and then ban people trying to use those techniques when the live version launches on their real, paid for accounts?
---
Yes please!
---
Yeah, i did it the other night to cause a stalemate at the end (Blew everyone up in the final circle, myself included)
---
YES. As a regular Apex Legends player I can’t tell you enough how great that system is.
---
This is one of my sentences. So thusly, in conclusion, this is my second sentence.
---
ok,
---
Have you tried re-installing the game?
---
No not yet
---
Not yet
---
Stealth Archer?
---
And people say sniper rifles are garbage...
---
Garbage for run n’ gun, but gold for trying to survive till the end, picking people off as you avoid big fire fights.
---
100% bethesda take my money dammit
---
This reminds me. I need to put some gears and screws in my vending machines. What's the going rate?
---
If I can't win, no one can.
---
You're opinion is of course you're opinion, like you I don't find these types of game modes appealing, however after playing the adventure mode on and off since release and having a lvl 122, lvl 75, lvl 41 characters, the game for me required a change ( survival mode, no thx, ) yet something quick and easy and I'll be honest NW hits the nail on the head. Of course it requires some tweaks, like every other mode does, however overall it's fun.
---
As a newbie who feels completely overwhelmed, thank you!
---
With honers lol
---
It's just weird too cuz I'm literally playing Fallout 4 right now with no issues lol. I'll reset the stuff over the weekend.
---
I can so relate I'm a  chameleon speed demon marsupial sniper with maxed out sneak my play style is patience and planning clearing areas from 1/4 mile away. People don't seem to stand as still as long as enemy AI does.
---
On top of that i am an amno hoarder  (5200+ .50 cal for "Betty White" my sniper rifle, 5500+ rounds of .45 cal for "You'll Shoot Your Eye Out" my lever action rifle, 5400+ shotgun shells for "THIS is my BOOM Stick!" My instigating combat shotgun, and 1200+ .50 ball for "Puff The Berserker Dragon"  so this 100, 200, 18 rounds at a time is not something I'm good at managing. 
---
I've got lucky a few times but i definitely suck I'm just here to slowly earn my points to explore vault 52
---
I've never even bothered to try them, except the one that sells mining maps. I like the mining maps, but of course my stash never has room to put anything in. I sell stuff to robots and buy stuff from players. I do agree that it's wasted that nowhere accepts pre-war money for anything.
---
I've been trying to help out the new players as well, like giving them their first set of raider PA, low level hazmat suits, etc.
---
It’s new players like you that keep this game going! Enjoy the wasteland!
---
there's a funny bug that happens during scorched earth anything that spawns that is scorched can be eaten with the cannibal perk deathclaws, mirelurk queens, dogs if its infected with the plague its free game
---
I dont think they should remove them but they cud do what fortnite did with invisibility; make it impossible to shoot/attack while active. This could be achieved by making it a “weapon item” you hold while in use instead of an aid consumable. But personally i think stealthboys are too fallout to remove all together. If not my suggestion, maybe just nerf the time or make the first shot or melee immediately cancel the effect.
---
That's part of wastelanders dlc, so sometime in fall.
---
agreed :)
---
That's a good point, but rather than remove them I think they should add berry mentats since they highlight living things
---
I never even really have time to friend other players in NW.  I dont know about waiting through matches either.   But if it could auto group friends in the same wait pool that would be great.
---
Look under stored or blueprints within build mode. Any items you had should be there
---
That’s the spirit! This community is built up of Amazing people, and it’s up to people like you to keep it going!
---
Select the resource extractor you want, and run around the site with it out in build mode (so it’s red cause you can’t place it anywhere)
---
Will give you the ghost outline of where you can drop it when you get near enough
---
Also is there a place on the net where i can get mini maps of the workshop areas?
---
Yup
---
You say logical, but so is my alternative interpretation, because all you have to go on initially is the terse instructions and past habits of the company. This being the same operation that does both mind numbing simplicity (Build 5 walls in CAMP or Workshop) and mind numbing difficulty (Infamous Photo Challenges) under the same term, "challenge," it's not an unreasonable interpretation of the initial statement, especially considering it would make sense to say "win" instead of "complete" to be clearer on the intent.
---
Logically, it might be wiser to offer an overt incentive to play, just like they've been encouraging group play and social interaction (take photo of person doing this) and the brewing system (brew a shit ton of booze and drink it).
---
I agree it is different. I don't agree with it being fun and here is why. 1. Risk/Reward is out of wack from the start. I shouldn't feel less rewarded for playing a PVP only mode. 2. The Cosmetics.....give me zero reason to play this mode seriously I don't really care about cosmetics give me a CAP boost or a large XP boost every 5-10 Overseer levels and THEN I would feel rewarded. 3. The game mode is designed to bring the battle royal crazies to the game. I will clarify that this is even attracting the attention of LARGE twitch BR mode players while I understand it is good exposure for the game the community and play style around this mode is even more toxic than normal PVP. I mean look at the people who get accused of stream sniping in fortnite lol. 4. I am not really sold on it I might revisit it after A LOT of tweaks but so far I am not impressed it is a cookie cutter mode I didn't ask for or want and as stated I feel meh my money funded the programming and time spent on this mode.
---
I want it all :( hopefully they extend the mode for another day or two
---
42
---
I prefer you to verify game data.
---
What do you mean?
---
I had the same but with a cockroach.... A fkking cockroach took the elevator to attack me o. O
---
Just pop an addictol
---
To be fair, probably a throw away account, but also to be fair, we're probably getting this preview AND free week to get people with throw away accounts to have at it.
---
There are a lot of UI improvements like that which would help a lot. Also hard to tell when you down someone sometimes. 
---
Sometimes the kill feed doesn’t keep up as it’s happening too. Especially if you are popping chems, etc
---
I have the same issue on PC, real shame since it was such a quick and easy daily.
---
Honestly, I think this will depen on how the free weekend turns out. If many people play and many people buy the game, it will likely remain unfree. But if too many people play but too few buy, I can see how beth would lunch the mode specifically for feee to play to keep traction.
---
&gt;And the store has shelves with plushies/globes/etc on them...
---
Wait.. They already implemented this? Or are you just referring to atom shop items?
---
If you like the picking of location, Try Ring Of ELysium on PC.
---
Put it in a stash box and no one but you can touch it.  Or dont die lol
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43056/~/what-do-i-do-if-im-getting-an-error-stating-unable-to-verify-latest-before
---
Really just want that skull icon! Anyone have a close up of that xo1 paint job?
---
You're a monster, and thats coming from someone who killed an entire towns worth of feral ghouls and made sure he ate each and every one.
---
Perfect! Thank you for explaining this to me!
---
I initially thought the same thing... but here's why it would be bad, people would stop buying atoms, the reason why bethesda rolled out NW and all this other free content for the game is because, for the most part, people buy atoms... they will actually more likely try to find ways to make it where EVERYONE has something in the atom shop that they purchase regularly.. I'm not saying I don't think it would be AWESOME if atoms were rewards, i just find it unlikely and in the end, counterproductive to GOOD new content
---
I get that notice every matxh, but I’m not actually leveling up. I have unspent perks which I think is triggering the notice for me.
---
PLEEEEEEEAASS
---
I agree, this is a must.
---
They have an armor piercing rifle perk as well?
---
*\*Stealthfully ruins pants\**
---
Cannot *wait* to get that. Just the +%40 damage boost is letting me one-shot with head shots.
---
Not Dr.Disrespect is it?
---
He is 6foot8
---
I’m not getting any messages like this I’m just unable to connect to NW
---
the 20th......in the year 2076
---
Any time! Holler if you have any more questions. Green thumb is fantastic to get, you can make a ton of healing salves and cooked food with it. I make a shit load of salves, and then cook the rest of whatever I picked up and sell it. It’s easy caps.
---
What ?
---
You can have up to 5 characters. Just make a new one. You can swap between them as you see fit.
---
you can just make a new character, don’t have to delete your old one if you don’t want to.
---
I agree 100%
---
?thanks pal
---
I mean, they *do*, so....
---
I'd love this and a wishlist for items I want when I save up enough atoms.
---
Agreed. I could see that and then having to make different accounts to see what hand you get dealt. I don't know if its because I'm getting older or not but I have been having a hard time finding a multiplayer game that I like, and as a couple of days ago I have been able to dust my PC off and have a good time.
---
Yeah this is true. I accidentally engaged in pvp with some people in a nuke zone. It was a team of two and me and we all remained civil as it was an accident. We just emoted at each other and went our separate ways rather than murder each other for that sweet sweet hardened mass and scrap.
---
Well *dang*. I had no idea about the L1 and R1 control. Thank you! More tools to play around with!
---
Okay. Cool.
---
The ability to have say 3 sets of perks and Sitch between them as needed, battle, crafting, misc whatever, that kind of thing
---
Largely, with an important caveat: The gameplay in Adventure Mode encourages this, because PvP is deliberately difficult if not impossible to initiate. Not a bad thing, but there is a little more to it than the fact that we're largely friendly folks.
---
- Exactly what "majority of cases" did false advertising not happen? Are you saying almost everyone got exactly what was sold to them including the canvas bag and only a few unlucky people got the cheap nylon one? 
---
- Lmao sorry friend but some random on the internet trying to defend his precious little game on reddit doesn't mean the factual evidence is suddenly being disputed. Good try though 😉 The fact is Bethesda advertised a "canvas bag". Money was then exchanged for this bag as well as other goods. The product that was then delivered to said customer then turned out to be of a lesser cheap nylon material and not even close to the advertised product. This is FALSE. ADVERTISING. You can shout and scream until you're blue that it isn't but by the very legal definition of the term, it entirely is. 
---
Here's the legal definition since you seem to be a bit, uninformed:
---
"False advertising is the use of false, misleading or unproven information to advertise products to consumers. A false advertisement can further be classified as deceptive if the advertiser deliberately misleads the consumer, as opposed to making an honest mistake" 
---
So advertising a canvas bag of a certain quality and then shipping paying consumers a nylon bag of a different quality = false information to advertise said product. 
---
What's more then Bethesda admitting that they did not ship a canvas bag due to it being too expensive to make (and then they tried saying there was a shortedge of canvas lmao) means it was not an honest mistake and therefore also = deceptive false advertising. 
---
Isn't that fun? Oh also here's the ad for the collectors edition advertising the CANVAS bag. Everyone ordered while the ad said canvas sorry. 
---

- Ah so anyone "crying" about something that doesn't impact them isn't okay in your books? I see good to know. So everyone living in North America who's "crying" about the Hong Kong extradition bill and way protestors are being treated even though it doesn't directly affect them whatsoever isn't okay. Got it. Thanks for clearing that up. 
---
What a terrible small narrow sighted person you are wow. Anything you don't like just isn't allowed hey? Thank god you're in no position of power lol. 
---
- Why do I need to provide proof I'm speaking for everyone who got the collectors edition?? When did I say I WAS lol? And how do you know I wasn't one of those buyers myself? Let me answer that for you the answer is you don't whatsoever so making silly assumptions without any statistical or numerical evidence is irresponsible and downright stupid. Nice argument smoke claim lol. 
---
- Sorry my apologies, I judged from your lack of understanding of basic consumer protection laws and illogical baseless claims that you were just some young teenager. So how have you reached 40s without even basic knowledge of how false advertising works? 
---
This isn't an assumption but a question, I'm guessing you're from the Southern United States right?
---
You mean share the same camp? Nope. You each have your own. Granted if your'e in a team you can build for them on there camp and vice versa, but the camp still only has 1 owner.
---
So I just played a game where somebody dropped a nuke after somebody killed me they had to run into the zone for the storm. Inside there was a named ghoul. I think it’s already a thing players who die to a nuke become ghouls.
---
Why would you have to choose between that and NW ? Literally makes no sense.
---
Gotta build nearby, we can build together in workshops but not in camps
---
Ya I think it would be good for the health of the game to go free but I would understand if it remains paid.
---
If you're on desktop and you right-click the image in Imgur and choose "View Image," you will see it full size, even larger than Imgur's zoom function, it's pretty close up.
---
Idk lol, I'm just saying that's the loadout thing they're talking about, maybe just means they wish loadouts came out first?
---
I play with my wife and it’s a fun activity we can work as a team on. The family the slays together stays together.
---
PVE
---
The new intro tune is a pleasantly menacing variant of the normal intro music.
---
No cell phone my bad auto correct lol
---
Shame there are only 3 more maps planned then and one of them looks to be a super small possible a 4v4 scenario.
---
Even when I level up?
---
Heh, I use rifleman, commando, demo expert, and the one for the guns (forget its name). I am well covered :)
---
Do you want the whole game to go free to play or just nuclear winter?
---
Think it's just forward slash s /s Dobby has socks
---
It should be a perfectly preserved pie
---
Yeah there's a ton of problems. Most recently for me I was doing a quest where you have to take a photo of a cargo bot.  So I activated the  nuclear key card quest at Enclave bunker, caught up to the cargo bot and took pics with a zoom lens. The pics did not count toward finishing the achievement. Next I tried it by activating a govt. supply drop.  I got very close to the cargo bot as it dropped. It couldn't have been more than three feet away. I push the button and nothing happens.  The picture simply didn't take. 
---
Yes, I had film. No, my photo library was not full.  The camera simply didn't work for no particular reason. Finally, I called in another supply drop and I got the picture.    It was ridiculous.
---
Even when I level up ?
---
Good luck using that while an invisible guy is shooting you in the face, lmao
---
Oooooo.. a la, left for dead..
---
Very curious to know if that Robin helmet at the end was the raider datamined helmet. If it is, looks like I’ll never get it, RIP.
---
 HONESTLY THOUGH. I HATED FORTNITE. I PLAYED IT 2 TIMES AND HATED BOTH OF THEM.  
---
But Nuclear Winter is so addictive. If not only for the amount of xp for adventure mode because I level up faster through NW than I do just playing adventure
---
There's too much flat open ground in Cranberry Bog, IMO. It would get pretty campy pretty quick, as you could see anyone coming from a mile away.
---
Can’t use mods with NW.
---
lmao...why on earth would you think of him? I mean the poor man had some one pop shots off at his house.
---
Idk how to share a post to here but if you go to r/fo76 and search "Nuclear Winter -" there is a list of unlockables, should be at the top
---
Idk what's farther in the vault, really excited to find out
---
I feel like I haven’t come across a nuke zone since NW launched.... 😅
---
When you pic NW its wipes your ini file to prevent ppl from having no grass ect. So you could mod perkload out back in everytime if you want but that would be a pain.
---
Thats the breaks tho. It's another measure of security and im all for it.
---
Gotta use in advance, just like they use stealth boys lol
---
Use the search bar. There is a list of all rewards up to 100 I believe. First 10 are mostly icons and a small stash and an overseers chair that’s pretty sweet
---
Going to have to disagree with you on cookie cutter mode, I've played most of the BRs on the market and 76 has a lot going for it that makes it stand out from the rest.
---
Nice update! @bethesda one thing though is that bug where your house blueprint is broke up into Dozens if different plans is back again
---
a dope moment if you want to feel like a real faggot
---
thanks boss got gutted from nowhere by a level 70 scorcher
---
I was just wondering what happens if everyone dies! That’s hilarious.
---
Go to a train station and read the posters on the notice board. Build a Personal Terminal in your camp or use someone else’s and read the notifications. Look for markers on the map for new events you haven’t seen before. Wander around in each area of the map; if there are locations you haven’t discovered they may come with quests.
---
Yeah it's super annoying. Also there is that ever present discover locations in the game that's been broken since the beta...I've discovered these places and they don't count as discovered. Missing my atoms
---
Ha for sure!
---
Yeah I get the no firing bug sometimes still too, spins up but doesnt shoot. Reloading is as intended though, gattling energy weapons work that was my, they always take the full cores first and work their way down to the partials. You can craft them at a tinkerers workbench
---
Cam someone help me get one please
---
Wow that’s cool, and that’s why I asked.  It never would have occurred to me that loving maps and geography had to do with it.
---
I think best you can do is get reduced weight on your character,  can't do anything about stash weight.
---
Like get yourself a set of armor with reduced weapon weight. I think each one does 20%? All the other armor pieces stack, so I'd imagine this one would too, but can't confirm. 
---
Rank 3 bear arms perk would also help. And just keep bulk of weapons you instead of stash i guess.
---
A bit tricky. I “teamed” up with players who just wanted to hide. I mean, its a strategy sure, but kind of defeats the intent. But i guess it was working, he was 31
---
Oh God. Killing a Scorched Beast Queen is the last item on one of my Atom lists and still hasn't been checked off- despite the fact hat I have killed so many that I have lost count.
---
Keep it aside for me. Just spent a bunch of caps on other stuff so I have to try to get that back
---
Dude you will just check some step in this article about verify game data.
---
Yeah they stack to a max of 90% I have all 5 pieces unyielding lol
---
I can carry an insane amount of weapons. But I also have an insane amount of legendary weapons I don't want to let go.
---
Agreed even when in a party with friends it's works so well.
---
Because we’re the best, of the best, of the best, sir!
---
I accessed one once during Beta. I don't even see them half the time anymore, they're just useless background objects to me.

So, sarcasm aside, I quite understand. It's not for you. Props for you. But you might want to work on your post-naming game, because yeesh, you checked all the boxes there, mate, all the more so in your followups. Your mature, concise opinions are no more mature or concise than... well, my own, here ;)
---
Coincidentally, I have been hanging in Adventure for most of this event (I enjoy the new mode, but fatigue easily on PvP gameplay), and the servers have been \*filled\* with lowbies joining in on normal gameplay. I appreciate the cynical view that it's dragging in Futnut and UserUndefined's FightingArea players, but to be honest, I think they were due for a free week anyhow, to show off changes and improvements and maybe bring in some folks who were on the fence, now that their shit is mostly together.
---
Either way, hope you enjoy the upcoming gameplay additions that are not Fruitbat or UUFA variants.
---
There's a fourth free item, it's a poster that unlocks a quest.
---
I e won 2 matches today with a stealth boy. I literally just walked right behind them and smoked them with a 50. They had no idea  where I was both times. Fun but definitely too easy to use and they last for like 30 seconds lol
---
In that case, if you are PC, have a tse gatling gun (I do not even dare dream of tse legacy gatling laser/plasma) or 50cal, 2* is enough, and willing for trade it for maximum 10k c (sadly, I am a casual, Pi hardly make a few hundred cs a day, my vendors sells well, but I am only online few a hour or two on workdays so...), I am willing to buy it from you (you can ripe some fresh melons if you like aswell, or drink some milk).
---
So can we all agree that some of these challenges are designed to be unreasonable, or annoying in order to purposefully dissuade people from earning free atoms? I mean with some of them it is painfully transparent.
---
kindness creates kindness.
---
most people who play fallout or skyrim are doing so out of fandom and escapism from the real world so tend to be alot kinder to those who are in their comfort zone so to not make it go sour.
---
Get concentrated fire, and vats aim for the head
---
Can do
---
Yeah but it's weird that once you have no fully charged cores left you can't reload anymore. Why are low charged cores not combined? I know it doesn't make much sense but the same thing happens with ballistic ammo which doesn't make sense as well
---
To be blunt, at that level, he should be waltzing into the local mines and gathering the plethora of materials to make his ammo. The Munitions Factory is not an efficient way to gather large volumes of ammo, it's just easier/safer.
---
It would also be nice if we could get a much larger build space, i really want the ability to create our own small little towns
---
I tried that. I'll check again after my work shift.
---
haha, sounds nice, but sorry, no such luck. i don‘t have the items you‘re looking for :/ i wish i had anything near tse
---
Thanks mate! Whats your gt
---
Zachy Chan13
---
Nice! Unfortunately sounds like best you can do. I doubt they will be increasing stash size again. Last article i read (linked below) indicated they probably could increase it but have decided not to because they want people to choose what to keep. Make it more about survival, instead of just hoarding everything without consequences.
---
I mean... you could always give them to me!? 😂
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/amp/bethesda-on-fallout-76-mods-selling-non-cosmetic-items-and-community-feedback/?__twitter_impression=true
---
I think it happened to me 2 or 3 times today (XB1). It does suck but I just roll with the punches for now. The servers are jammed packed with people so it’s probably normal. What was weird for me was I was getting dashboards and server disconnects and my team mates were fine. Idk
---
No its not dude. It shouldnt take a whole server to kill a player, thats what SBQ is for you have no interest in balance you just want to be able to take peoples gear from what it looks like
---
[Yes, just filter off what you don’t need](https://fo76map.com/)
---
Oh yes.  This would make a fun mode even more fun.
---
Nope. Place it as you please.
---
I absolutely agree.
---
Good to know, thanks man
---
I think until recent update, rifle perks were bugged and didn't apply to it. Since they have been fixed and now apply to it, railway rifles are more feasible.
---
Wtf are u talking about m8. You just trying to start trouble. I even stated game had issues I mentioned before the launch people said they were boycotting it and not gonna play it cus it wasnt F5 or for w.e reason without given it a chance. If they played it disliked it idc. That's fair. And I never said they went through with the boycott I said they said they were going to but most obviosuly didnt. Again they did it just to start shit before it was even out. And we live in a world where most people dont form their own opinions and just blindly agree with someone without actually trying or doing said thing. Maybe  actaully read my comment next time.
---
I wish the atom shop wasnt so glitchy on xbox! I went to go look at items earlier and it automatically bought the stupid mothman billboards when i went to look at it :(
---
&gt; “set up like messages in dark souls”
---
“Thrust but whole”
---
2 levels away from the PUBG helmet!
---
800lbs is such an untidy number though, they might aswell give us a nice round 1000lbs lol
---
I can give them to you in exchange for caps 😉
---
I know they're good sloths, I just think that if you're going to present them on a scale of 1-10, making every one of them an 11 defeats the purpose.
---
Yea my .44 doesn’t look like that! Lol. When I got the paint I jumped back to adventure to slap it on, thinking it would look like that one but... it did not.
---
Pretty sure if you win with a squad you stay teamed with them into the next match. I had one other guy playing with me and we won. Went straight back to the queue lobby amd we were still matched up.
---
I really like this idea. Pre-war money are just annoyance atm. Prize bot .. I started to shoot them before they can actualy act. Safes .. I am just passign by .. there is nothing inside to make open them. 
---
You can even make those vending machines sell some items wich are unreasonably hard to get now. Royal Jelly, Deathclaw skin, etc.
---
There are tons of players. They're just all level 1-10. I swap back over to it between matches because while I enjoy the new game mode I have low tolerance for PvP, and it is weird to not have a million camps all selling the same 20 easy to grab plans or grossly overpriced ammo.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
#Choo choo!!
---
it's hardened and prim better?
---
I was having a blast until I encountered hackers.  My teammate was literally streaming his set of tools on YouTube and advertising it to us during the game.
---
Ruined it for me.
---
My IGN is MrBright01. Add me, and I can probably help you tomorrow at some point.
---
i actually bought the game before the free weekend an honestly im glad i did, isnt modded fun like i had with FO4 but its still holds up well an is still fun, the only gripe i have is that since im still low level nukes suck....i had a guy nuke a vital quest area around the VTU airport were alot of my quests were so i was kinda screwed in doing them but oh well
---
Camp animals shouldn't be killable in adventure
---
Same so I avoid the Gatling.
---
Props for presenting an opinion as an opinion and not as an undeniable fact. I am usually not a PvP player, but I am slowly discovering that NW is tons of fun if I revert to my solo play habits... as a sniper. Especially after I ranked up a few times and got the rifle damage perk.
---
Pretty much all of this.
---
I agree with the idea that pre-war money is supposed to be nothing more than cloth as sort of an existential point, that value is determined by the community. Even more fun that the post-apocalyptic currency derives from a Cola company.
---
The vending machines is kind of a joke as well, imagine getting ammo like they're candy on the street corner.
---
Anyways, I also agree on the logic that pre-war machines use the pre-war currency. It's a tough one, and nobody wins
---
The overseer box in flatwoods is better, no meaningful weight limit.
---
Yeah I had something similar happen when I did an emote. An enemy came up to me thinking he'd get an easy kill so I just left lol
---
They'd have to figure it out in Adventure mode. Here we are 6 months post release and I keep getting duplicates in every perk pack. I don't have every card yet either.
---
Honestly, because it's not a PUBG/Fruitnut clone. It has the same base premise, but it is definitely Fallout flavored and remarkably fair. I've taken down PA users with a 10mm, and I am a shit PvP player.
---
So basically Zombies from Halo 3! :o
---
Check your stored tab
---
May have duplicated your base, need to delete stuff
---
I used to use it, and it does occasionally work, but it never proced when I needed it. I ended up switching to the critical savvy perk and began drowning in crits.
---
I was in a game where we all picked are spawn places like usual but then it put “LITERALLY” everyone at camp McClintock no joke the game lasted about 5 minutes it was crazy! I choose to spawn at Sutton btw if you’re wondering
---
But ET is the worst game that ever existed.
---
Nothing is stored and I haven't touched my base in months so there shouldn't be anything duplicated.
---
Report him to Bethesda if it's an issue.
---
I prefer the PvP in NW to survival.
---
Gravy!
---
 "don't give people incentive to play" that not what I said things that mean real-world money attract cheaters, that just a thing and as i said "until Bethesda get a handle on that issues" we should not encourage them put money on the line which will attract cheaters which will ruin the experiences for the player base both old AND the NEW guys just coming in and feed into the FALLOUT 76 is broken narrative.   
---
the second paragraph onward i don't even know how to respond to you that was, not my point. listen once Bethesda has a good anti-cheat tool in place, hell just report player button when you viewing him cheater, they can add atoms till then i would say stay away from letting the cheaters get high off making atoms to buy atom shop items and ruin everyone else's time.
---
For sure, sent them the link to his channel too.
---
But when it does it's stupid strong
---
I agree there, but it shouldn’t affect survival/adventure. If Bethesda has a sort of team based loadout pvp system (like cods multiplayer in a way) giving the game a dedicated pvp game mode that isn’t a battle royale it would give more of a variety to the community.
---
Same but I just hate br modes
---
Survival is semi boring due to vats only time I felt like it was true PvP was when I stalked a dude for 20 min sniping him slowly
---
*Also vats is aimbot but legal*
---
This! 100% this.
---
How about this. The more kills you get before dying the stronger the monster is that you can respawn as. For example if you get 0 kills you can only spawn in as a ghoul but if you get 5 you can spawn as something else for example super mutant.
---
Good old Slippery Slope, a classic. And if "teaching a lesson" worked, EA would have cut their shit decades ago.
---
Did you at least win the match?? Lmao
---
Scale is an important thing if you’re claiming a majority of the community thought it was horrible. 
---
I feel the proportion is much smaller than you think. Truth is: people that are generally happy with a product won’t comment on the product. BUT.... those who complain will be loud about it. That’s human nature (read: science!!)
---
Especially in this sub... for a while if anyone said a positive comment about the game they were flamed by the vocal minority.
---
Technically we don't have bows.  You can't be an Archer without a bow...  and No, a crossbow doesn't count.  Bethesda:  Please add long bows and let us mod the arrows.  I'd love a longbow with explosive arrows.  I could then play Rambo of Fallout....   .grin.
---
Though, this comment reminds me of Skyrim.  I started out as a Stealth Archer which got my sneak stats and bow stats way up.  I got to the point where I could one-shot most anything with the bow but would only last 30 seconds with a sword.  I finally relented and leveled up my sword skills.
---
Make them take burned books and magazines too please
---
Also there's a Possom challenge where you have to use it.
---
Well yeah, but I didn’t end up doing much with everyone dropping like fucking flies around us.
---
If you've seen the teaser for NPC's, you'll have seen a bow.
---
Xbox doesn’t have an ssd unfortunately. Id play on pc but all my friends are on console so i tend to get all my multiplayer games for xbox
---
Didn't check my autocorrect
---
What?
---
It just says Summer i believe. Wastelanders is in autumn
---
A Fusion/Plasma Core loading device would be awesome...
---
This community loves to act like there was some massive conspiracy around the game, but at launch this game was bad, Bethesda has said so themselves, this isn't my opinion its fact. 
---
All the reputable people who reviewed the game gave very good reasons to not like Fallout 76 but like anything there are those who use this as an opportunity to push their own brand further, that happens with every game and not just Fallout 76. The biggest thing that made reviewers such a big factor on release was the fact that, because of Bethesda's greed, people could only try out the game in BETA if they dropped $60 on a pre-order, people couldn't get their hands on the game to formulate their own opinions, this doesn't mean the game wasn't bad just that Bethesda probably would have sold more on release. 
---
Luckily Bethesda is doing great work on the game and making it the game it should have been at launch. Hopefully they keep it up and fix the issues reviewers were having on launch by the time the next expansion drops if they haven't already.
---
I've been playing a day now. I've have two players try to goad me into a fight but I was low on ammo so I ignored them. So they are out there but it's easy to get away from them. There are Wanted events which is probably why dudes were trying to pick a fight.
---
As for the kindness, people build their camps to help out others. One guy build a fancy camp with everything people need. He was there, so I thanked him with a Radaway and Stimpack. He dropped a legendary nukashine for me. Fun when you're just starting out in a new-to-you game and you can learn the mechanics without having people kill you every thirty seconds.
---
&gt; I'm not sure if it was Angry Joe or Jim Stirling (both are nowadays really angry) who made his video "review" consisting basically of bugs and crashes gathered from all over the internet. Instead of showing the actual gameplay they have misinformed their audience about the state of the game.
---
I remember the review video that you're talking about. They also recorded themselves playing the game in the most comically, deliberately inept manner possible so as to make the game look completely unplayable. I was terribly disappointed that people weren't calling them out for this deceptive and obviously manipulative approach at the time, but as you say, there was nobody who was going to respond favourably to anything said against any condemnation of the game at the time, no matter how ludicrous.
---
I bet I even know the hacker's name, he's been popping up in a lot of youtube videos. Not sharing because of "no witch hunt" policy, but I suspect they'll be gone soon on sheer volume alone.
---
You have to get the very last shot on her for it to count....
---
Yeah this reads just like a paid post
---
Wait, underarmors can't, but costumes (that block what type of armor your opponent is wearing - a valuable tidbit when weighing fight/flight) can?
---
Remove leaderboard remove vats on players... And boom you got a populated survival mode.
---
Pressed the push to talk button?
---
this game has so many bugs. Anyone who can tolarate hours of this game can be known for having an insane amount of patience.
---
I just re-watched it.  Yes, there is a bow.  It's only shown for a split second...  Missed it the first few times.
---
I got mine backpack already, and yes I hated dat guy shooting from roof while fire goes away as one alone cannot collect enough dry kindling.
---
BUT
---
Then I noticed, when enough people in, fire has never chance to go away. 
---
Which mean.
---
You need guy on the roof.
---
But he need to be real exterminator. If you wipe insect wave fast enough, fuck of kindlings.
---
They would have had to have well over 50 stims for how long we were alone.
---
Well if so then it's broken.
---
It doesn’t even take a whole server. You simply don’t have PvP experience or you just suck big time at it. I keep hearing artistic claims like: iNvIsIbIlItY iS oP OMG BeTheSdA nErF iT, sEnTiNeL iS bRoKeN, nErF eXpLoSivE etc. there is a counter for each one of those, you guys just don’t know how to play the game. Casual PvPers getting their ass kicked by players who know the core mechanics. 
---
Targeting HUD and berry mentats is solid counter to stealth boys and invisibility. Critical VATS build is counter to Sentinel/Assassin since it ignores the legendary armor effects. Stagger/cripple is another counter to sentinel. In Endurance Fireproof perk reduces explosive damage by 45%, pair that with the combat armor  armor material that reduces further explosive damage and there you go, a build that ignores 95% of explosive damage and all those marsupial with explosive shotguns ain’t got shit on you. 
---
I could give you the best stuff this game can offer and still find a way to kick your ass and you could do the same. If only you would use your brain and find some counterplays instead of crying to Bethesda.
---
I know exploits have been running rampant with Bethesda constantly introducing more but I didn’t know there were proper cheats around.
---
quick question how often does this event show up? cause i've done it only once.
---
Almost the entire road going north east from watoga to the mire is hollow underneath. Entrances spotted all along on the side of the road.
---
Just nuked the end of the game and everyone got 2nd place.
---
Purified water is pretty good to sell for caps to vendors
---
There's nothing you can do but drop them. If you're anything like me you have to train yourself not to reload them until the core is empty.
---
Sucks that it wasn’t a real win but a W is a W my man! I got killed by a speed hacker earlier and I’d rather be in you shoes lmao
---
Pharma works wonders in BR mode. Just saying its not totally unlikely as most BR games require you to hide outside of the zone when it focuses on a wide open field.
---
Grandfather s are amazing
---
I was wish it have like in fallout 4...
---
If they are close, harder. If they are far easier. Again it has draw backs. Perks are mean to give you an edge so you dont have a point here.
---
Have you been in the final zone? It kills incredibly quick
---
As you level, you add points to your character's SPECIAL stats. Those SPECIAL stats are in NW mode, and determine what perk cards you can equip.
---
Another reason I'm glad I play it on console.
---
Just to add to that, a much closer guaranteed radroach spawn is the Crevasse Dam just to the east of the lodge.
---
When you download the game from the Bethesda launcher, one of the options on the start screen is "Buy Now"  and the price is $29.99. They're only offering the Standard Edition through the launcher, not the Tricentennial Edition.
---
Nope. You can also use blueprints from Adventure mode in NW, so long as its parts you can use there (so, for example, no turrets)
---
Yeah, or the option to combine the loads of several cores...
---
You gain xp, a lot in fact, in NW mode. On my character that's reached rank 22 I've gone from level 50 to 60. You just have to go in to adventure mode to sort your SPECIAL points.
---
Yeah, people choose to express these thoughts in dishonest, inflamatory terms. There have always been some NPCs, and more have been added throughout the course of Wild Appalachia. These people who claim that there are no NPCs would surely not say that characters like Codsworth, Curie, Ada, Strong, Hancock and Danse aren't NPCs just because they're not human. But they choose to apply that criteria to characters like Graham, Modus, Rose and Biv because it serves the purposes of the narrative that they subscribe to. They know they're being dishonest. The people they're speaking to know they're being dishonest. But everyone agrees with one another because that's where the upvotes and "likes" are.
---
You can drop (not stash) all of your good cores and then use the crap ones to craft ultracite cores. They will still have full charge. You need to know the plans for a prime gatling plasma though
---
please pm me it becuase I did save the name. I am working on reporting em now.
---
I'm pretty sure it was just a Bethesda employee who was really happy to see the work that he and his team had been doing finally seeing the light of day. Those front rows are usually filled with employees of the company in question.
---
I am VERY proud to say that my son has decided to stop playing Fortnite and start playing real games. As a gamerdad this brought a tear to my eye...
---
Yeah, I needed to train that, too. It's fascinating how shooters teaches me to reload after every Enemy and how hard it is to act against this :D
---
1st of all, people who use grammar as part if their arguement do so because they have no valid cou ter points. 2nd, it's been 6 months and they have given no word what so ever about unbanning all these cheaters despite the fact that they removed the duplicated rare items and patched duping. Your opinions are no more fact than mine. At least my claim can be backed by Bethesdas actions so far, yours cannot. You are just being a salty little troll arguing a point that doesn't matter either way. I hope all the dupers stay banned.
---
Of she weighs as much as a duck then she's a witch
---
Exactly lol. Holtsering your weapon will cancel the reload by the way.
---
Sorry i misunderstood you at first. Yeah after level 50 or so you have to start reallocating those points. You don't get anymore
---
I don't want them to nerf stealth boys, I just want them to add berry mentats because that is the only counter to them.
---
Losing loved ones is super tough, hang in there!  I lost my father Feb 8, 2019 so I definitely understand your pain.  And it's weird, I escaped the only way I knew...video games.  10 minutes after hearing of his death I logged on to Warframe and played for 5 or 6 hrs.  Lots of people see gaming as a waste of time...etc, but most of us here really do find comfort and real friendship in game.  Cheers to you grandfather!
---
I did read your comment thanks? Quite a few times and just re-read it to be sure but I responded accordingly based on the contents of your comment. You did not say that these youtubers didnt go through with the boycott so how am I supposed to know that you knew they didn't? The thing about living in a world where people blindly agree is just an opinion, although I would agree to an extent when it comes to the more negative and damaging things in life but that's more down to those people not being intelligent enough to form a decent opinion. 
---
Again though I fully read your comment, quite a few times thanks.
---
Upclose and personal, concentrated fire to the head for the humanoid enemies.
---
Once you reach a certain point, regular weapons won't really cut it anymore. You'll need to start looking for legendary weapons for that extra ummf in damage. Either that or try switching to something with a high fire rate and DPS, like a light machine gun, gatlin plasma, gatlin, etc.
---
Again thats not a time measurement. Hard to say if you don't have video.
---
Nah man. I've been using the railway for months and rifle perks have always worked on it.
---
I feel like it's softening a bit over there on r/Fallout. Earlier today there was yet another "DAE Fallout 76 is a bad game upvotes plz" thread of the sort which historically always would have gotten over 10,000 upvotes. This one seems to have topped out at under 1,000, and [my comment which calls bullshit on it, which again historically would have landed at about -200 karma is sitting at about +200](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/c0525n/my_recent_experience_with_fallout_76/er1w5n6/). I feel like the hatemob mentality is fading away, slowly but surely.
---
Come on, use imgur or review on YouTube. We want to see it.
---
Nuclear Winter for sure.
---
Berry mentats are op. It should be line of sight. Not seeing through buildings.
---
What was in their inventory?  I’m thinking it’s just a player with a jokey name
---
Lmao. This man thinks a simple ui mod is better than an entire new game mode worh new mechanics, perk cards, and usable items.
---
Do it all for the choo choo
---
Its worse when there is challanges involving miling brahims. Then everyone is petting your cow and agroing it.
---
They arent any more OP than stealth boys
---
Can you imaging kiting a monstrous line of ghouls with a motorbike?
---
I honestly think it gives more than 60% and the "60%" listed is a visual bug - food doesn't rot for (real-world) *days*.
---
I just have one three story brownstone with a roof deck, a  large dock that runs along the lake side and then steps up to a rounded walkway with brick walls that surrounds the west side of my mini island, and a garden on the mini island. It's basically an oasis in the Mire near Thunder Mountain, on the south side of the lake.  
---
I really need to get pictures up.  Maybe this weekend 'll  take pictures and do a video walk through.
---
There was a guy in back everquest that had 6 PCs and ran 6 different accounts.  Had a crazy setup of hardware where he could control all 6 PCs via 1 keyboard.    Used macros on the other characters to do things like heals/nukes.    All characters would change directions at the exact same time.  All characters wore the same colors on the outfits.  Blue/White I think?   He would just farm rare items and sell them.   He made so much money doing that, quit his normal job.  Not sure what happened after they started cracking down on selling digital goods.
---
How are you supposed to pop a berry mentats whilst getting shot at by a stealth boy player? Especially with how slow the menu's run (PS4). Also.. what if you have no berries? dead? lol
---
I am about your level and I find shotguns do poor damage unless you are point blank. But they are also slow, at least all I have found, so,I stick with semiauto rifles. 
---
My regular weapon is The Fixer, which I’ve been using for... 25 levels? A long time anyway.
---
To add to that, there are two guaranteed radroaches spawn within the two buildings the quest robot is in. So farm them up, when they are available.
---
Quest items, high level weapons, and an article of clothing that (and I quote) “helps you blend in to your environment” and the way he walked was super strange too and he’d start doing things but it go too far away he’d spin in a 180* I have it on video on my twitch
---
A lot of people don't like Fallout at all, and that's fine. I find exploring the world way more entertaining than constant explosions.
---
I generally hate pvp in main game, but it’s really satisfying in NW. I totally agree
---
Perks always applied. I was messing around with an explosive one for a week or so before selling it.
---
It is free to play. You just need to own the base game, rightfully so.
---
This is one of the many posts i was referring to. Even has bethesda replying to the OP confirming it was an issue and being fixed.

---
I've been using a quad railway for like 2 and half months and the commando perks have always increased the damage for me.
---
Not according to this.. even bethesda replied saying they would fix.
---
&gt; to do something different
---
Different for Fallout anyway...
---
What BR game does not have its hackers?  I don't know of any that are hacker free.  Bethesda does need to keep a lid on it though, if it gets above a certain level it will discourage people from playing or worse encourage them to hack too.
---
All of you have been just outstanding... I am now level 12 and , aside from almost getting creamed by a legendary Sheepsquatch whilst trying to go to Welch though this horrid little town infested with red protectrons ( I think I'll try another way) the scorched farming helps. A lot.  Thankfully meds seem to generate if I log out and back in. Now it seems like I need lots of junk to scrap to do those CAMP quests. That's fairly straight forward. These lower levels are hard as hell, but there is progress. That spewing thing in the Toxic valley will have to wait, I don't feel like wasting fertilizer on birch trees all by myself.  Morgantown Airport is my friend, and thank y'all for making the introductions.
---
Yeah the post is 2months or so old. You probably got it right after it got fixed.
---
I usually check everyday and sometimes there's new stuff and sometimes there's not.
---
Ah. Old news then I guess.
---
Weird because they definitely applied to me, even when I switched to the automatic receiver and changed perks accordingly. This was a couple months ago. I wouldn’t have used it if perks didn’t apply. Maybe it was situational or something.
---
Favourites menu. (It's not limited to weapons)
---
I gotta do events for that right?
---
I have to try this next Queen
---
Lol, dropping to 30 or 40fps. Firing an automatic gun used to drop it to 3.
---
But Fallout isn’t about constant cod style action- it’s more about exploring/crafting. It’s fine if it’s not their style- some like that constant twitch of gunfire instead
---
I'm a controller user as well but I'm not feeling like I'm at a disadvantage.  I usually get 4-5 kills/downs unless I'm on a team with a crazy good player that just Rambos it.  Don't get discouraged, once you learn how everything works you'll be just fine.  This is the most beginner-friendly BR I've seen.
---
I'd like this too, but it may end up kinda like the fortnite thing, where everyone accused them of copying Apex for implementing it
---
Yes, you are making a statement, with nothing to back it up. To put that into question because it contradicts what I have seen is not petty or unconstructive.
---
The SPECIAL points I have in NW are different than the ones I have in Adventure, though. They seem to be random every time I get an Overseer level.
---
I want wood armor to let me look like a stump when I crouch.
---
For legendary weapons? Mostly you get them from legendary enemies. Best chances are whitesprings. Even if you don't get a great weapon, can turn them in for scrip and then use the scrip at legendary purveyor to try and get something better there. Alternatively if you have the caps, can buy off other players.
---
He's a good Twitter follow as well.  Doesn't post too much but some of his posts are great.
---
So which is better? The backpack or rank 3 Good with Salt? I’m debating on dropping Good with salt so I can use the points toward other perks. But not sure how the mod for backpack is.
---
Yup, PC.
---
That doesn’t make sense. A common sense feature can’t be copied, that’s like accusing someone of copying someone else because that someone else had guns in their game first.
---
Well the post is 2months old. So it was fixed within the last 2-3 months. So maybe you got yours right after they fixed it? 
---
Or like you said, maybe it was just an issue for some, not all. I don't know the specifics and that post doesn't really go into detail.
---
Dont know what to tell you man, that's just what I saw happen when fortnite did it. Cant really explain the internet lol
---
NW PvP is 10x better. Problem with survival/adventure PvP is the legeandary items an mutations, they just don't work in a PvP environment without having a bunch of dudes/girls 1/2 shot each other.
---
NW actually involves map knowledge, positional advantage, no VATS, no Stealth, no Explosive rounds, no Bloodied, no sentinal, no Assassin.
---
Survival/Adventure PvP is luck based, and depends entirely on who has what gear/mutations. It was broken as hell.
---
Post on market 76, Someone will either give you some or mod yours for you, for a fee of course, I got my full set of modded t-51 on there for 2500 caps a few months ago
---
Yes, this. As a father of three (youngest is 1) I find FO76 really relaxing since I can really push it at my own speed. Have three friends in similar situation and we often play together after 21PM when kids are at sleep. And by often I mean maybe once a week but thats a lot for our situation.  
---
I take no pressure from this game and it gives me none. I can log in for 15-30min or for 3 hours and it's all good progress. Sometimes I log in just to cook some food, boil some water, sleep and play some instrument to get ready for next real play session.    
---
Would like to give some critisism also but just now there isn't anything in mind. Maybe camp building since it's very restricted and therefore frustrating to start over and over again to get built right. Also old bugs could go away, like Rose's syringer missing until you log in again and again.....
---
You can find the mods randomly in spot around the map or have someone mod them for you. Price for that can vary quite a bit depending on if you supply materials. I usually mod a set for 1500 caps which is reasonable. r/Market76 has a lot of folks that mod armor.
---
Pace at which food spoils makes me just eat anything I pass by. With carnivore I even stopped to cook meat at some point. There is so many recipes with nice effects ... but ... why to use so much effort on making them when they rot so fast. 
---
Give us freezer, so when you cook something,  you can actualy eat it and get use of it before it spoils. 
---
(I hate idea someone raid mine fridge !!!!!)
---
Great idea
---
I’ve never noticed the glasses, I’ll have to check that out later.
---
&gt; if a guy wants to mod his game so he can always see the sweet spot or correct answer when lock picking or hacking then whatever you do you. 
---
That is still 100% cheating.
---
Apparently now Antione sells the recipe but yeah the challenges are broken...
---
You haven't met me yet.  I'll kill you and sell your junk to the vendor.
---
Thank you, very kind and helpful :)
---
Usually on patch days which are Thursday I believe.
---
Really glow or reflex sights
---
I mean you can find someone to put them on for ya.  
---
I’d be happy to mod them for ya but you’ll have to pay me for the mats (not that much).
---
Perhaps the vending machines could be linked to the Atom Challenges? It would provide positive encouragement to visit them. Like others I encountered the vending machines, took one look at the offering and have not returned since. Equally the U-Mine-It! machines are a little unloved too. There was a Backpack related Challenge requiring a U-Mine-It! map, which made for a welcome change.  The use of pre-war money certainly gets my vote. Only so many Civil War Era suits you can make with it!
---
Perhaps posts with proved link to vid about cheaters should be allowed but with no name calling. Obviously reporting this to Bethesda is a must.
---
Yeah it is but it does nothing to ruin other players games and therefore I do not give a shit about it.
---
The only reason cheating is bad at all is that it harms other people but if you do it in a way that does not affect others I simply don't have the energy to care about it.
---
Alright, thought so
---
Thanks! 
---
Found a 2* 2 shot for 800 caps, bought that shit real quick! Even with grounded + class freak has 246 damage about 100 more damage than my tse handmade
---
Everytime it's night time in game.
---
I have Fallout 4 and it prevents me building if they are being clipped?   You using a mod?
---
Turn them in for scrip? What does that mean exactly
---
Shotguns are not really meant for dps weapons. They shine most as crowd control via Enforcer.
---
If you want shotguns to do dmg as primary attribute, you need more than damage perks. Mutation, bloodied, etc.
---
The legendarys are eh ok not that bad but the fact that they "fixed guns" it's what pissed off people 
---
Snipers can't one shot while shotguns can
---
It’s not the bull barrel mod, it’s just the skin. Once you get it, go into adventure mode and just make it at the weapon’s workbench.
---
Oh wow, so it used to be way worse. Good to know the game actually improved since then, hopefully they'll keep on doing so.
---
DCG with a bloodied build really rips
---
AAAAAAH! Slocum’s Joe power armor!!!! Not as pink as the uniforms were, but as a coffee addict I absolutely NEED IT
---
Yeh I know, but you really going to open up that window whilst been in a gun fight, and then cycle to it? Come on now, by the time you do that, you're probably dead from the OP boy.
---
Same here for all those badges. I have been looking and grinding for a week for plasma grenade plans to complete the chemist badge. Plus the syringer doesn’t register hits. Just fix the game.
---
Winner winner, Scorchbeast dinner.
---
Concentrated fire and Skeet Shooter both help with accuracy. Vats is good but if you run power armor it drains your cores fast. Damage with shotguns is pretty lackluster until you get pretty close now.
---
Agreed... i am level 207 (also level 58 mule) only just discivering this now! It would not be that hard for them to write "it's verdant season etc... x2 on flowers and plant picking"
---
So far all dlc we know if is free even NW
---
What are the mats? I’m well stocked on everything but screws (at least I think I am)
---
If you go to any station there's a machine where you can hand in your legendary weapons for scrips which you can then use to pay for legendary weapons sold by the purveyor
---
I get that they can be frustrating but you’ll get better at seeing them “shimmer” the more you get used to seeing them.    
---
They should probably at least cut the time down on them or as someone else suggested give us berry mentats.
---
There's some pretty nice items in here but a lot of the lower level stuff feels like filler compared to how nice the major cosmetics look. Such as the player icons, which don't really seem to share a theme of Nuclear Winter, just...random assorted icons.
---
I like dis
---
I think there's an in game explanation that they were converted to caps shortly before the war as a Nuka Cola promotion.
---
thing is i did all my build around shotguns, am i fkd? should i start over?
---
No i'm not because i come prepared and have them in my favourites wheel from the get-go. My favourites wheel is organised, an it takes 2 seconds to open the wheel. 
---
Are you standing out in the open getting shot whilst trying to change weapon or something? You're doing it wrong if you are.
---
P.S i haven't died to a Stealth Boy user yet because i can hear/see them. They're not completely invisible, anyone with enough vision and patience will notice the dodgy texture, or just scan the environment because guess what?
---
They can be invisible yet you'll still see the cursor go red and see their name the second your reticle is on them.
---
I genuinely don't have a problem.
---
Level 73.. I see.
---
Yeah, it used to be horrendous but they usually make stability improvements with every patch so its gotten a hell of alot better. It's super cheap now so it's not like you'd be investing a tonne of money into it.
---
I'd say it's worth grabbing but if the frame rate thing is that abhorrent to you you might be waiting a while to get it buttery smoothe
---
Yeah I saw a guy the other day with 23 plus kills.  Maybe he was that good... but I kind of doubt it.
---
Mutstions don't effect your special as far as perk cards are concerned. Only as far as other modifiers like max ap, health, carry weight, ECT.
---
If you only just used the serum, there are no negative side effects for 1 hour :)
---
Got attacked by a second sheepsquatch, flares didn’t help. They just did like 2 damage to it /s
---
The flares seemed good but when you’re knee deep in Ash country I don’t think anyone’s gonna see them 😥
---
To me, that is still exploit.  Your doing something that is not intended to happen.
---
I see, thank you.
---
Every train station has a legendary vending machine, looks like some slot machine. Sits right outside. Any unwanted legendary weapons you go and toss them in that thing in exchange for scrip.
---
Scrip is the currency used by the legendary purveyor located at Berkeley Springs station. It allows you to somewhat narrow down the kind of legendary weapon you want. 
---
Typically killing a legendary enemy it's all random. You can get 1star, 2 or 3 star and can be anything from melee to ranged or armor. At the purveyor you can guarantee the number of stars by paying for then with scrip. It also lets you choose type, like melee, ranged or armor. The effects and actual weapon are still random, but better odds than just killing enemies.
---
This game and NW favours the automatics tbh. Always has, you'd get sooo many complaints at being one shot.
---
It's why games over the years have went away from a one shit sniper meta, people cry when they die even though said sniper has the weakness of being close range and one bullet firing every 3/5 seconds.
---
Yeah I know but the serum wore off, thanks for the response though.
---
bore off
---
Idk but have you ever fired a TSE flachette harpoon gun!?  I got one from the purveyor and 1k a shot damage with perks...
---
Hmm.. what does it say under the effects tab? Did you happen to take any RAD-X recently?
---
Serum wore off? You mean you cured it?
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/438769630?t=691s
---
Here’s video of what happened
---
You have to either be naive or not be paying attention to know that they have had to fix a ton of issues since this game first came out
---
No, I meant the 1 hour no negative effect buff after you apply it.
---
"I'm just pointing out that the positivity around this game is much larger than it was a week ago"
---
 The only TS I'll use is my TS Auto Grenade Launcher. The serious inaccuracy TS imposes, is just a bonus for it. ;)
---
It's the ancient fossil of an engine and the unstable servers.
---
If you remember, prices before the war were pretty high. It would take you weeks to farm the pre war money to buy a bullet off them.
---
Oh yeah yeah okay
---
Yeah but I'll use this gauss rifle until I find a better
---
35 Aluminum
---
35 Fiberglass
---
35 Adhesive
---
5 Pure Violet Flux
---
That’s per leg
---
Tbh snipers never one shot it's the shot guns and auto guns it's why I have moved to a legacy sniper just to feel like a sniper
---
It's ok I got the answer and apparently mutations don't affect perk card points.
---
Way better dmg output than my tse handmade
---
I can play tomorrow, I am level 54 and my psn is NotBanned_
---
 I kill him when I can. He hunted me when I was low level and weak. Now I murder the sucker every time I can, which is every time he shows up.
---
I can also do the jet pack if you like. That takes 
---
35 Asbestos
---
35 Nuclear Material
---
5 Pure Cobalt Flux
---
Thanks for the info
---
Just out of curiosity, how does it run for you ?
---
Dead babies?
---
I would rather not make it easier for dupers to do things.   Hands down, no.
---
Im lvl 148 and im only just finding out 🤣 if im being totally honest thought it meant there where more animals to hunt or somthing 🤣🤣
---
&gt; this game definitely doesn’t deserve harsh criticism. 
---
Yes it did, because the criticism given was from the product **at launch** which even Todd Howard himself agreed on. Does it deserve the same criticism *now*? No, and thats because its been vastly improved on since launch thanks to the hard work from the developers.
---
Just a personal taste, but I complain about it in destiny. I don't know though, each is entitled to their own opinions.
---
Ah makes sense
---
I wouldn't wish that on anyone I know...fuck those things...
---
You essentially have two sets of special stats. Base level for perks and actual for everything else. Temporary buffs and debuffs have no effect on how many perk points you have.
---
 My Auto Handmade Exploder with 30%+ Damage to animals, almost all the bosses, hits at 110 and will hit at about 140 when I'm done. A beastly thing. Its quite accurate too. ;)
---
Technically it would be the X-02 as what we would call the X-02 the fallout 3 armor is based off of the advanced power armor aka the perfected version of the X-01
---
Thats a valid comment and a good idea. Ive never used those vending machines. All those items are really easy to obtain, either by drop or crafting, so whats the point wasting huge pile of caps on them.
---
we could always just up it for PC only.
---
Thank you for clarifying that for me. Being pedantic about these things is really important for me to grow as  a person.
---
Shotgun work best as a supplementary weapon for melee. So use Enforcer to cripple enemies then finish kill with melee. It's largely in STR tree so use melee as your main damage and shotguns as set-up attacks.
---
...I got better.
---
Feels slightly worse winning and realizing you don't get anything at all
---
Me either but I make an exception for cheaters.
---
Where the hell do I get pure violet flux?
---
 Yeah they are not a bad sniper and a useful mid range but so slow. My Instigating Lever Action is down to about 125 now as I ramp up Auto in place of Rifleman. No matter a Stealth shot on full health is still in the 500 range. ;)
---
I don't know if this is true any more, but in the past I've noticed that I've had to relocate my camp for the budget to be updated.
---
Stop telling me lies...
---
Do you have fullscreen enabled? This game runs like absolute crap in borderless windowed. When I first started it up, I had like 45fps max. (with a GTX1080 and an i7 7700k). 
---
Switched to fullscreen, now I have always atleast 100fps. Playing 1080p, everything on the highest settings except shadows.
---
Go back where you came from. A mic is all you need here.
---
Wow, there's so much cool stuff near the end...shame I won't get it before the pre-beta ends. I'll just shoot for the slocum's joe paint, stretch goal will be the BoS minigun
---
This is good to know, I’ve started killing the sentry robots for a bit of xp as they award a fair bit but noticed nothing was coming up for the other bots, didn’t know if it was a display bug or something!
---
It helps the economy.
---
So far the ones I unlocked work with any, so I don't see why it would be different for certain ones
---
Are you on an SSD?
---
You are the exception, not the rule.
---
thx for the tip bro!
---
Tuesday
---
I usually try to get some weapon and armor in the beginning and then hide until there's one player left and only then try to attack if I'm sure I will hit.
---
Well that’s what I meant. Now it definitely doesn’t because I’m having a blast playing it and it doesn’t seem anywhere close to what I was reading about it.
---
If I'm right and it's really 90%, it boils down to whether you'd rather have the extra carry weight or the extra perk points. I prefer the perk points.
---
I was also surprised at this, considering previous updates this mode launched with amazing stability and features. For something marketed as a pre-beta, it's pretty damn functional and popular

---
Yes we should get a small amount of xp for damage
---
That sucks, but you dont need to do those quests to beat the game. You can start the endgame quests at anytime.
---
I never claimed I was the rule :) Though I don't think it's fair to call me the exception when the majority of the entire internet has shit on FO76 for its mtx (fair criticisms or not, people still hate it)
---
Since Brahmin milk suffered a reduction in frequency, I gave up on keeping one. So often I'd return to find them harassed by other creatures. It become a chore to have to keep repairing the fertilizer generator. Only once encountered a player harming my Brahmin.
---
Thanks!
---
HOWPLS IVE BEEN LOOKING HOW cus I've been meaning to get the power armor station
---
You heretic.
---
Why would he hang around low level areas then? As my stream shows I watched him take radiation damage for a solid 10 minutes, why any player would do that even for the meme confuses me
---
I'm thinking about returning soon. I didn't really have anyone to play with and got bored. Looking at all the changes may bring me back
---
Nuke zones, you have to pick 10x irradiated flowers and kill enemies for glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids.
---
This just made me to want to play BR mode!
---
When you equip armor, it unequips your costume. Weird.
---
They could of at least added 2 more perks with the patch.
---
In the bottom right of the ash heap there is a building (I think its grafton) and going in there will activate the quest that allows you to get the blueprint for the power armour station. It will require you to craft a full set of excavator though.
---
Maybe you're playing on PC then and it's different, but I think you're still wrong.
---
You've just said it take cover right? How you supposed to take cover when you don't know where the guy is? Very hard to predict a good spot for cover when you don't know where the shots are coming from.
---
Secondly you say you can see them because of the shimmer, which is fine, however it's not that easy to spot apart from having your cursor flash red, and even so.. you can't judge the distance so... I don't agree with what you said.
---
No, besides they repawn.
---
No.   That is not the case (Pre-NW).
---
I played every day and in the last month I played back around Patch 5... Every single player 100+level  that would come to my CAMP would just start blowing it up.
---
When playing around the nuke zone around whitesprings, some people would see me with half health and constantly follow me around shooting at me trying to get hardened mass I guess?  
---
Now compare that to how many would give free stuff?  0 people in my experience.  No I never used mic, I never shoot anyone and have had pacifist mode on since levell 5, nor do I ever ever take any workshops.  So I am not the one being a jerk here.
---
When I started playing 2 days after beta?  Tons of friendly people.   After patch 5 when I quit playing?  I can guess than maybe half the population had gotten toxic?  Dont know, it got to the point, I avoided everyone because they would 1) Use TSE to 1 shot the legendaries and 2) try and steal all the legendary spawns I caused by showing up at Whitesprings club.
---
I got tired of going to whitesprings and dealing with jerks.  Was level 160 and still had crafted handmade because I refuse to support dupers by buying anything from players.   Hardly any players would actually sell anything unless it was TSE.   Those were all duped because the chance to get one of those is so miniscule.   
---
So for me the game was great with multiplayer initially... but by patch 5, got worse than a single player game.
---
I was just a casual trying to stick to all the rules without the trap-xp exploits or mutation exploits, ect.    I invested 250 hours into the game and it was just time for me to move on.
---
So no, I would not call the community in Fallout 76 good anymore.  Its toxic.
---
Woah, so awesome!
---
10/10 got the armor you my man saved me no more spamming e on rose
---
Ye I agree after a while I probably can get used to it, it would just be better if it didn't exist, invisibility in a battle royale is a terrible idea, so is seeing through walls.
---
Theres a lot of multiplayer games without text chat.
---
10/10 my man you saved me no more spamming e on rose
---
Stealth boys still give a shimmer you can detect against most backgrounds, and you can still be marked with that red arrow above you once an enemy has line of sight on you. Berry mentats give away the position of everybody around you with no counter whatsoever, unless sneaking negates its effect
---
Agreed. A toggle seems best: purchased / unpurchased / all. Three simple categories.
---
The locked door of the cabin the quest giver is in contains a reproach spawn. I just hop over the wall (no lock pick needed), kill the roach, and hop back to turn in the quest.
---
So you telling a few emotes are not enough to communicate with others?
---
Something i've never, ever heard before...
---
Already tried that and a bunch more stuff I found while searching for fixes. Some of these actually improved the performance, I was able to achieve 70-80 FPS at some point but it would still drop to 30-40 FPS sometimes.
---
I want more budget space so I can fill it with 500 Mr. Pebbles stuffies. 😜
---
You still hear their shots, you see tracers coming from where they shot, and you see their shimmer. You even still get the red arrow above them when you keep a line of sight on them. Stealth boys aren't that good. I think it would make sense to decloak you once you shoot, but they're already fine-ish as it is.
---
People rarely want to PVP in this game, and also just so you know you ***cannot*** get hurt unless you attack somebody back when they attack you.
---
With the exception of workshops
---
Did you even play this fucking game to level 20? I'm not talking about DJ, I'm talking about radio host this game has. Yes I count Rose as radio host.
---
Nah but seriously - a proper ingame text chat is one of the most needed, still missing things of QoL
---
I always forget the milk... then in a blink of an eye its all spoiled :(
---
They actually aren't in the game since the release, still not fixed to this day.
---
Same boat as you! 6 Shotgun Master cards. 14 dupes so far. Completely out of easy card packs too because the challenges are bugged :(
---
That's awesome :)
---
This has been suggested hundreds of times already - being able to make your own legendary would remove the endgame variety and balance. You will just have everybody running around with the same bloodied/two shot explosive or bloodied/instigating swing speed weapons. Even if the more popular effects have a higher cost to make, there will be absolutely nobody making 90% of the effects
---
I agree but it won't happen.  Bethesda hates PC users.
---
Doesn't mean it is a good idea.
---
Yes! Holy crap I've been want a knock together Camp forever! I love my Camp's location, it's perfect for vending but I want to play with new designs in different areas of the map without loosing my current set up. 1000% behind this idea!
---
Duplicates does seem a bit silly/pointless when there's literally no point to them beyond wasting your card pack and giving you pity exp as a "whoops, sorry you're unlucky" message.

I hear melee is good also but i have no experience with it.
---
Thank you for your useless input.
---
Any chance this is a problem with other online games??
---
Thanks for that. I think I picked that lock only yesterday but killing the radroach didn't register in my mind its usefulness!
---
Just curious if removing them all together would free up server space for other things like stash or camp budgets? 
---
With player vending we can buy almost anything, anywhere at this point, but some increased space would be awesome.
---
Dude really? Like okay there child
---
Yeh I agree you have a chance to actually spot them, but let's be honest the chance of you spotting them + getting the arrow above their head is very low compared to what they can do, it should just be removed in my opinion, or they should be unstealthed as soon as they fire a shot.
---
Some people still fail to understand this is F76 not F4., you do not build settlements, but a camp.

*a  place with temporary accommodation of huts, tents, or other structures,  typically used by soldiers, refugees, or travelling people.*
---
It is a creative and fun idea but lore wise it wouldn’t make the most sense as the only faction to have had Vertibird Schematics at the time were the Enclave and those were only with the Whitesprings Bunker Enclave and the Oil Rig Enclave, in fallout 3 we
---
Find out that the planned release of the Vertibird was in 2085 but never happened for obvious reasons.
---
If you do decide to go along with this plan add in some lore behind it that wouldn’t interfere with the already prewritten lore, maybe this was the experimental prototype of the Vertibird and Vault-Tec Executives talked about the Prototype copy being sent to Vault 51 for research purposes and persuaded the higher ups/brass of the Pre-War Government to do so as a trade off for project safehouse and add in a ruined Vault 51 Vertibird just outside of Vault 51 in Adventure Mode and Survival Mode.
---
ohhhh good to know
---
Me too! Gonna get me some new pets.
---
Never said that. Just said that it clearly is not something new to be seen.
---
Well, he's in Power Armor (and possibly Aquaboy perk) so probably not taking many rads. And when you became an audience, it made it worth continuing the act.
---
Hanging around low level areas gets your attention. His actions keep it. His commitment to the role is why I commend him.
---
If this really was a test NPC, he wouldn't show up in your recent player list.
---
Or maybe someone (a player) is testing a bot script? 🤷‍♂️
---
For a 5yo it is.
---
If I remember, I think the super mutants were bred with the FEV virus (or whatever it was called) in order to create “super soldiers” for the war. But then the bombs fell. So might make sense that they would appear in 76, though I don’t think that there would be as large a super mutant population as there are later in the timeline. Of course, I could be full of scorchbeast guano, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong 😜
---
I have an anti armor explosive harpoon gun with the fletchettes mod. That thing is a beast.
---
Yeah feels like it's too weighted towards simply surviving (i.e. avoiding fights) and then getting the hits that knock down and/or kill players (basically just sniping kills).  Should try to encourage more teamwork in general with the way the scoring/rewards works since not everyone is going to be a pre-arranged 4man.
---
This is how sneak mechanics work.
---
There are three states - hidden, caution, danger. If you are in 'danger' it means the opponent has absolute advantage of their perception against your sneak.
---
If you stand still, your sneak is usually zero (at least in NW). If you crouch, red thing disappears.
---
Its not only a shooter, but a RPG too.
---
A duck!
---
We need text chat in general.
---
Alright I could see those as possibilities
---
Might as well jump off the bridge if you think you have the time to text chat in nw. 
---
That or you are camping in a building. Still gonna end up dead if you have a chat box going.
---
In the social menu at main menu. Invite friend to team. Then there is an option to play with team which will result in you being placed in the same match as friend.
---
It's unusual for multiplayer PC games to not have text chat.  Perhaps this is true of console games.
---
His inventory cycles through each time you load into a server
---
You can also place it, then move it to another location. Doesn't seem to be a place limit either.
---
I have a legendary double barrel, quad capacity, furious shotgun and I use the Shotgunner (all three card sets), Tenderizer, Enforcer, Bloody Mess, and Skeetshooter perks.  I can kill a glowing Ghoul or a level 68 Super Mutant with 2 to 3 shots with everything set up (excluding Chem and bobblehead buffs).
---
 It's my go-to weapon most of the time.  I've taken down legendary sheepsquatch and even the odd ScortchBeast with it.  I use it in power armor to cripple glowing ghouls (aim for the knees) when I'm sharing kills.
---
If I remember right, I have 14 in strength and 9 in perception.  The 9 in perception lets me switch to rifles and automatic rifles when I want to.  The strength points can also be used for Melee and heavy guns (i.e. .50 cal maching gun).
---
The thing to remember about shotguns is that they are short range weapons.  You can figure out the distance by using VATS.  Once VATS hits 80%+ then you are good, any further away and you will do little damage.  Do this a few times and you get a good idea how how close you need to be.  I was making the basic mistake of shooting from too far a distance for a long time until I starting using VATS more often.  Now I have it locked in.
---
*collect some more woodsticks of campfire tales*
---
Might be all the new players straining the servers.
---
I doubt I'm a good bench mark, I'm on xbox. But the performance from launch is night and day. Heard similar on pc
---
You cant play the battle royale game mode with mods installed. So you have to choose: remove the mod and play the new game mode... or keep the mod and don't play.
---
Oh good, I was worried it was just me and I was permenantly locked out...
---
I'm all for putting down their user names. Cheaters need to be punished. However personal data (such as actual names of these people or anything), is a step to far. Save that for Bethesda.
---
Technically, if you're in a team together, you can both build within one player's camp area. However, you will share the camp budget and space.
---
Otherwise, you'll simply need to place your camp down in as close a proximity to his as possible (which isn't very close).
---
I think "verdant season" is fairly clear about what is it, as non-English speaker.
---
That's actually a really good idea. I never use the vending machines...but if they took pre war money, I would!
---
People who radiate hate like a nuclear blast feel the self cool and important. It doesen't matter if it is about a game, movie or something else. I don't know when this "trend" started, but it gets worse every year. I play and do things I like, but it seems they like just complaining 😕
---
What kind of loot? Junk, guns?
---
I'm also on the AU servers, I haven't noticed long load times except for waiting for NW but I have noticed the lag in pick up/damage to enemies in Adventure mode, and I have had crash issues more than usual. I thought it was just my internet lol
---
Scrap for learn mods and junk.
---
Sell for caps to vendor bots at train stations.
---
Sell plans, mods at your vending stations at your camp.
---
Sell junk, ammo, chems, stimpaks at your vending stations at your camp.
---
The same thing could he said of any Fallout or Elder Scrolls game, it's the style of game they are so human npc's won't change the pace of things.
---
Hacker
---
Just wanted to add there are other builds so dont take mine as gospel. Gunslinger, medic, shotgunner. Sime perjs are definately better than others but it really depends on how you like to play.
---
You dont have to have maxed out dps to have fun in the game. I just have this thing where i like to min max my characters to be optimal.
---
Games uses a *lot* of VRAM with textures on high.
---
I turned mine down to medium and went from stuttering to smooth.
---
I think I've seen him play on Xbox.
---
I'd prefer being able to make my own than grinding for something i MIGHT like and isn't some garbage by playing a slot machine.    
---
The whole "hey i spent 30 minutes taking down the SBQ, I'm a sniper build and I got two Legendary Super Sledges...guess i can get 50 scrips to gamble with later"  system is bullshit
---
Level 22 Overseer rank so far here. The new areas seem to offer a bit more to the story behind vault 51.
---
Level-ups unlock new holo tapes to pick up and terminals to access as well as new spaces to explore.
---
At 10, you can visit the Overseer's office and the reactor room. Further within here is a locked door requiring level 100.
---
At 20, there's a hallway/room behind the gym that you can access, but I dont want to spoil what's back there.
---
Scrap everything.
---
If you need caps sell it all at teainststions. But keep enough to repair your gear.
---
Legendary stuff - use the best, scrap the rest at legendary exchange machines and use the scrip to buy better stuff.
---
No-legendary weapons and armour scrap at workbenches to learn mods.
---
Junk you can either keep to craft and repair stuff with or bulk and sell.
---
Don't keep too many of each chem or food accept maybe stimpacks.
---
Exactly: Nobody wants .38 or 10mm.
---
I usually don't resort to calling someone a hacker but ive been thinking about it and its been a few hours since it happened and I think he was hacking
---
Is thier a bright head lamp mod for the excavator?
---
you're such an egotistical ass, look the bottom line is legendaries unbalance pvp that's it there is no getting around it, it doesn't matter if people drop their legendaries on death. because the pvp is still unbalanced you fool the game mode isn't meant for hard core pvp thats what NW is for and that's why they removed legendaries and V.A.T.S, according to you every one needs to constantly have berry mentats stealth boys and your build then whats the point of having any other perks or builds? Why have a majority of the game not even viable? you keep citing items and perks like  nobody here on reddit's heard of them like a majority of us havent been here since the beta. I already know about everything you said and guess what it still doesn't balance the pvp, also your ideas are totally counter productive to the topic and honestly completely terrible, this topic is about balancing pvp not making it even more unbalanced and rewarding broken mechanics. Snob.
---
I have extra guns, armor outfit.
---
Yeah me either, but there are actual youtube vids showing at least 1 hacker flying around, auto aiming and killing people.
---
I believe the Makeshift Ronin helmet isn't shown in the image, any have any idea what it looks like or has a link to it?
---
I have a marine combat helmet but it looks different, with out the gasmask and the blue and red lights.
---
Unrelated to the thread, but I feel like if you sit in the same spot for about 30 sec without moving and your camping, Birds should fly over your head for your punishment.
---
There's always Nukashine
---
Hellfire
---
That's the combat helmet.
---
Check your inventory to see if you have a Responder Fireman Outfit. You can give that to me.
---
When I had it, it was doing ~70 damage per shot at a very long range (from atop a cliff probably 9-10 Camp walls high). Being closer to the target it's probably even better. Add in an energy bobblehead and Master Rifleman I can't even imagine. Whole squads would melt.
---
I've only ever seen it come off the scorchbeast or a terminal so they're pretty damn rare though.
---
I use shotguns too. It's the stealth what makes it for me.
---
if you get grouped with a cheater the normal order of business is to hang around only long enough to get proof and once that is done alt+F4 you risk guilt by association otherwise.
---
By hanging around and riding the coattails when you know someone is hacking you are arguably condoning it which in my eyes is almost as bad as if you were doing it yourself.
---
Here is a song for the wounded Brahmin owners:  
---
When I  looked into that Brahmins eye, 
---
I'm sure to God it made me cry, 
---
I asked myself why oh why, oh why,
---
Would this creature want to die, 
---
"Chorus"
---
Because it was I, 
---
I launched it in the sky, 
---
It spread so far and wide, 
---
And ruined Animals lives, 
---
So why I ask you why, 
---
Would you want a suffered life,
---
Just... Let.... The..  Brahmin die 😔
---
&gt;Definitely. Because if it closes to the west, there are only 4 places where you can get over without marsupial: 
---
You can build stairs.
---
Indeed insane. I am level 136 and Im still far from getting all the perk cards, yet ive got quite few double. Sometimes it maybe useful though, when i try different builds and for instance instead 3* card I need 2* or 1* of this same type.
---
I can't remember the last time i dared use the mic, risking waking others in the house just not worth!
---
&gt;lobbing explosives would be fucking awesome.
---
You won't have that much.
---
Red rocket stations have a stash box.
---
You can also build a stash box at your camp.
---
Do it in your personal stash box. If you put it in the overseers then someone else can take it.
---
No. Everything is on that console that you buy it.
---
No it is not as uncommon as you think. Destiny 2 and Anthem, just to name 2 off the top of my head. And those are AAA titles as well.
---
Hopefully we get a full 100 day timeline for the full nuclear winter dlc after the trial week
---
It is, but it also isn't. The only way to get it was to hack into the dev room which Bethesda has announced is cheating and says crafting the helmet can lead to a ban. You can learn the plan if you scrap it, so people have been selling a lot of them so the cycle continues. If you see it in a vending machine it's safer to ignore it or at the very least don't scrap/craft it
---
Ugh, that's unfortunate. Thanks for the answer!
---
I’ve never seen adventure mode so empty. I’ve been away for a couple weeks and wow. No one playing adventure.
---
i think it's the hellfire PA you unlock it a level 100, there are other paints to unlock at lower levels as well, there is a full list of rewards here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzrzjq/list\_of\_nuclear\_winter\_rewards\_by\_rank\_and\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzrzjq/list_of_nuclear_winter_rewards_by_rank_and_how_to/)
---
Even if the cheat r/fo76 does not tolerate snitches!
---
In Australia, we have a big  retailer called JB Hifi and about a month ago I got the Tricentennial game and a T-51 Nuka PA Pop Vinyl for $29. Already had the game but bought it for a friend and this week, exact same store it’s $69. 
---
Cannot work out the pricing schedule in this game.
---
Great idea. At the moment all I see is winners tea-bagging their last victim and firing off their guns. This would be pretty dignified and apt.
---
It's just a demo. There's a load of other content for this dlc then the battle royale mode will be back in full.
---
Train stations have vendors
---
I hope when the level 50 reset update comes in, this is addressed. Nothing is more frustrating than this. Eventually duplicates take over your card selection and make it harder to choose cards for choices.
---
"Sneak Peek" is basically Pre-Beta Access, if I'm remembering right.
---
As for carrying over, I think the Pre-Order Beta players kept their progress, so it's possible.
---
So stimpacking a wanted dying player should make you wanted too.
---
This is 100% false, it's a rare drop that you can get the plan for, but you don't need it if you find a player vendor selling the helmet. I have the helmet plan learned and sell the actual helmet regularly, and still no ban.
---
Is a level 50 reset actually in the works? Would love this
---
Yes, play with the high level one. He will become lvl 1 in NW mode, you can equip only seven perk cards, you can use 7 strength cards or combine, it does not matter, but the total of Strength must get into the Strength value as your main character has. For example, I found Charisma card with value 9, but my Charisma on main character is only 7, so I cannot equip that perk card. But I can equip 7x Perk cards with value 1, or 2x value 3 and 1x value 1. Your Overseer level does not improve your character I think, I do not see any change on lvl 16 but better variety of perk cards. It will not affect your main character in any way, when you return to adventure mode, he will be as you left him (plus the reward icons, skins craftables from the NW mode  -these are not account shared, so you want them to be on your main).
---
Bundle them and sell that shit to a vendor. I tend to gather materials I don't need while looting damn near everything. Beyond the rarity of ballistic fiber, plastic and ammo materials are where my supplies run short. Everything  else is caps.
---
Like the Pulowski ones you find the skeletons in while exploring Appalachia?
---
I have some bad new for you...
---
You cant detect that shmmier in grass which is what 90% of the new game mode is.
---
Have you checked that it's just not hidden on the emote wheel? If you're on PC press Q when you have the cursor over the different emotes (can't remember which one the gift emote is on). It should be tied to your account so I don't see why you would lose it entirely by reinstalling the game client.
---
Yea I've checked.. Guess my game is smacked, only reason I had to reinstall was because I put neon letters up earlier and my games started dropping frames like crazy, even after removing the lights.
---
I'm in a similar position. Been really enjoying the Nuclear Winter as it's a chance to enjoy a little Fallout time in a neat half-hour chunk (okay, 20 minutes, I usually die pretty quickly).
---
For me the "magic fix" (from 25~30 FPS to 100~120 FPS) was reducing shadow distance in the .ini to 3000 (from ... I think it was 60000?). It seems like the game was trying to render shadows in the Cranberry Bog when I was standing in Flatwoods. Don't know if you tried that specific setting.  
---
That's with an I5 though, so might not work for you.  
---
My mate has a Ryzen. His ran fine on a clean install - I'll try asking for his settings.
---
Me and my partner are in the UK. We were both thinking his, and other people's in the UK, will ship out after the US people have gotten theirs
---
Yes, here’s a [link.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) 
---
Go to the Summer 2019 section, “Legendary Players.”
---
His voice actor!
---
Thanks for that. Now off to make some combat armour :-)
---
Just... Let.... The..  Brahmin... die 😪
---
Not only does it destroy part of a players camp, it also destroys part of my heart
---
It gets destroyed
---
There is a text chat for Xbox, found by going to the map and selecting Social. Select the person you want to chat with, and there's an option to send a message. Clunky, but it's there - at least on Xbox. Maybe it's there for PC too.
---
This. Claiming a Public Workshop, then doing a Defend quest (usually a minute or so later) is the best way to earn plans, stimpacs, unusual weapons etc.
---
Your camp gets destroyed. Prior to nuke dropping you get like a 2 minute warning and can pull up map to see where it will hit. If your camp is in the area you have 3 options
---
1- do nothing and have it destroyed
---
2- jump to another server or log off for the day
---
3- move your camp to another location.
---
Gamertag is SaiMeatLegs add me, I'll stop by and say hi, and help if needed, of course!
---
That is remediable taking roles. Even if all are starting in vault 76 on level 2. In your team one need be the explorer. This explorer need run like a mad man all over the map, discovering the fast travel points and identifying the places with enemies. He just need survive, run and take notes, he don't need kill the enemies. While the rest of the team do a activity like take a workshop, a quest or a event. When they finish the explorer must have a interesting place discovered available to fast travel. If the explorer has discovered enough POIs he
---
Thanks, I also tried this at some point these days, it didn't make much of a difference.
---
New Feature: Legendary Players – An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Brahmin milk and sugarbombs - breakfast of appalachian champions.
---
It's like coming back a favourite holiday location. But with monsters.
---
The % damage cards in general either need to cost more or be toned down to 25% or less buffs. 
---
They're just ridiculously strong as of right now.
---
It doesn't?? Oh wow. Yeah that needs fixing.
---
Probably a player using a stealth boy or with Chameleon gear.
---
If you look around watoga, and harpers ferry, you can find it possibly in the mod section for A WHOLE BUNCH CHEAPER, but again the chances of actually finding the calibrated shocks mod is meh, to annoying. I ended up just buying the plan.  
---
one good way to get cash quick or relatively quickly when you're bored is use the perks Can do and pharma farm to get as much food and chems to sell to the vendor.
---
Would like to order #10 and #12 - also 50. But without the sauce.
---
Is there garlic bread for free?
---
Well no cause the story actualy is based around non surviving. Kinda would have killed the mood.
---
Same I hopped on a few times and I seen maybe three or four camps that were selling stuff on the whole map
---
How do you drop it so someone else can get it? I tried to give my brother a spare frame and it wouldn’t let me.
---
Watch the video it does not look like it was using a stealth boy, I turned off passive mode, attack it and no damage at all
---
I'm sure I read somewhere that will carry over
---
What perks does the craftable camera, have over the regular photomode?
---
Since last patch I hard crash back to my desktop at least once per gaming session.
---
Same issue. 
---
I assumed it meant winning, until you mentioned spectating the whole match.
---
Gonna have to try that.
---
The fact that as a long-time FO76 player I know the map, the weapons, the game mechanics etc. encouraged me to leap in and give my first ever BR game a go. I used to like watching Pewdiepie play PubG, but it looked kind of complicated (though probably wasn't). I was thinking of picking up PubG now it's on PS4, but I don't need to now.
---
This is dope!
---
Not for win, but for some challenges, like kill 5AIs. Because no matter what skill I have, i can't win if i get leaving teammates every game.
---
I wish the Vault shelf which is already in the camp had a purpose... It just looks sad while empty.
---
I don’t know if this was just for the picture, or it’s your general roleplay but either way I love it! What a cool idea!
---
Well I found a person named Dmmefeetpics yesterday
---
That was a mistake made by devs and they followed it up by saying that it's actually not obtainable so don't go surprised pikachu if they delete the item from your inventory in the future. No action was taken ever since but it's not obtainable and that's coming from bethesda
---
This is 50% false. You won't get banned for owning or crafting the helmet, only for accessing the dev room. The plans for the armored helmet are not in the game though, never have been.
---
Thank you! It's my alt char, I managed to find the rare BoS bomber and flight helmet (now my official toon outfit) and stumbled on that plane!
---
And intoxicated with Rum Rogers Reserve.
---
I was hoping we’d get a double update this week as the nuclear winter stuff happened on the Monday, but alas, no update on Tuesday. Next week it is.
---
You are talking about having the majority of the game viable? The guy who wants to ban legendaries??? Hahaha
---
And not even NW is that balanced. Weapon meta is already defined by heavy and/or automatic guns. Armor meta is marine armor and PA and nothing else and meta perk cards are the ones who buff damage and frog legs. The isn’t much diversity there as well. If you see someone using a pipe gun is because they didn’t find anything better, not because they deliberately WANT to use that gun. 
---
Ironically is with legendaries that you have more diversity, because even a shitty pipe gun can become good with the right effects. Without legendaries is all about heavy guns, automatic rifles and marine armor. Nice diversity, good job.
---
Southern Forest*
---
Can drop nukes at north forest
---
Just... Let.... The..  Brahmin die 😪
---
I want to learn the history and lore of vault 51 so i played NW
---
But I'm an adventure guy
---
I got caught out like that outside Arktos Pharma. I saw the suit, ran to it and they gunned me down like a dog from the bushes. But hats off to you, sirs.
---
They can still have pacifist on and it doesn’t show as doing damage
---
I agree but CAMPs should still require materials to build in adventure mode IMO.
---
And it’s defiantly s player, when u do have pacifist on and swing it says pacifist is enabled cannot damage player in the top left
---
Yes CAMPs will still require materials
---
Might be a badly loaded player or their just using a stealthboy, but it’s definitely a player
---
Had a nuke drop at the nuka plant in the south yesterday.
---
I'm a Level 77 and have played most days since the Beta. In all the hours I've spent in the wasteland I've come across perhaps four players who wanted to be dicks.
---
Wow, your story is beautiful!! That had to take a lot to share, and I’m thankful that you did. I lost my aunt almost a year ago this August to lung cancer. Small-cell, which is a bitch. She loved flowers and was a master gardener. Though my thumbs aren’t as green as hers, I’ve been trying my hand at gardening because it makes me feel closer to her. 
---
I cried the first day I played 76 after I walked past some rhododendrons by the vault, because they reminded me of how much she loved gardening (they’re very popular where I live, like every house has at least one, or two, or five, and I’ve never seen one smaller than a Prius). Like, at first I was okay - I was tickled pink by at the thought of picking soot flowers - and then I stumbled on some rhododendrons and thought to myself, “the fuck kind of puny rhododendron is this shit?” and that’s when I lost it, just laugh-crying like the hot mess that I am because she would have said the same damn thing. 
---
I believe that one only lives as long as one is remembered. It’s these little things that tell us that they’re still here - we just have to listen. 
---
Digital hugs and good vibes to you, buddy. If we were on the same consoles, I’d visit your cabin by the lake and drop a rhododendron flower by your grandfather’s urn so that they can hang out in the Wasteland together. 💕
---
Bro you know u use a perk to put into a card of your choice every level right? And the only thing that effects what perks u can use that perk point on is level, park packs are just free perks on top of the ones you spend your perk points on smh
---
r/falloutcaptures
---
That is an epic win! I always feel bad when I can't just power in and revive someone. Last match I got pinned down behind a tree while my team mates were just so close to me bleeding out and I couldn't get to them. I thought maybe I could pick this lot off from behind the tree, then race out and save them once the heat was off, but there was too many, just got nailed in the back as I lined up my shot. Still that was the first time I made it to under ten players, so I'll count that as a win, even if we got waxed in the end :)
---
The billboard budget change hit me hard. I had one mothman billboard and two of the smaller mothman signs in my camp. The design is to look like a pre-war motel "The Mothman Motel". Prior to the last patch I had roughly ten percent budget left. Post patch I had to remove all three light up mothman signs, a port-a-potty, a dumpster, and redo my entire power grid to be at about 95% budget. 
---
This is without using any rug trickery etc. Just building as intended. I agree with the OP. If the Atom Shop keeps having nice stuff in it but I can't place it what's the point?
---
It's like the disease curing fountain in Whitesprings. We all seem to find out about these things here.
---
Thank you!
---
I was playing a few nights ago the rest my team down two guys and I killed the last members of the enemy team for some reason I got all three kills and it just did not feel right to me. I don't know how they would fix that but they should. maybe collected team down and kills exp to go along with your personal exp for downs and kills, I don't know.
---
what is wrong with it
---
Inferno mk 3 I think
---
I don’t think I showed this in the video but I turned off passive mode, hit it a couple of time and still nothing
---
sometimes? it drops when a scorched runs past a tree. it drops all the time. and not only that, a ghoul can stand right in front of me and i have 95% but the shot still fires right beside it. wtf 
---
make VATS have some common sense please. the first shot should always be the best, not the other way around. what‘s the point of VATS building up accuracy with every shot. in IRL if you‘re missing the first shot your target becomes nervous, you get nervous, adrenaline starts flowing, etc.
---
Tis a bug. The daily challenges for a card have also been disabled due to exploits I think. I wonder how long they will have Nuclear Winter down when this sneak peak is over for bug fixing.
---
Yea that’s because he would still have pacifist my dude
---
Is it true that moving/replacing your camp will reset and recalculate the budget in cases where the volume has bugged? I don't want to risk moving my precious camp if this isn't the case.
---
It's just weird that I'm maxed out - I don't have turrets and I feel like my house isn't as huge as others I visit.
---
I dropped it then came back at the beginning of wild appalachia. It was 90% fixed and new content became a weekly thing. If 76 released in january it wouldve been way better received.
---
I have played 10 hours and I’m level 20 just farm a certain location keep server hopping to make enemies respawn
---
Thanks for the info guys!
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Dailies are bugged yes. The lifetime challenge for completing matches should still work. You must be alive at the end when your team wins.
---
Me too, i somehow love it, even when i get frustrated 10times a day playing it. It reminds me old times of World of warcraft gaming.
---
If he has pacifist on you swinging at him won’t show as attacking it’ll just be swinging air, if u or not of you have pacifist on and you swing at him it’ll display the “pacifist is enabled cannot damage player in the top left” case closed problem solved. :)
---
I used to love pre-war money in the previous Fallout titles because they were minimal weight and decent value. Now, it's good to wipe your arse

page was updated now mentioning a patch  :)
---
MY IMMERSION!
---
Actually nothing.
---
They’ve clearly gone above and beyond to deliver a quality product after pissing everyone off the first time.
---
From what I can tell its actually best to just kill the bugs as fast as possible from each wave. The fire seems to reset each wave, and its gets harder to keep it going via kindling if you don't have 4+ people. The lats time I did it I just took my my flamethrower and plasma flamer to everything. That seemed to work out well enough.
---
Not going to lie, I’m a little bit let down by it just being a skin. The terminals reference X-02 Power Armor so I was really looking forward to getting a more advanced power armor set. Oh well...
---
Go to whitesprings and kill ghouls, preferably with some type of PA
---
It shows up in data mines but isnt in the game
---
Holy shit. These are some dope ass rewards.
---
It's only for that session. If you leave the session and join the server again, they'll be unblocked
---
Where is this photo taken at?
---
This could be a game mode similar to Left 4 Dead’s versus mode. One of my favorite multiplayer experiences ever
---
I'd like signs we can write, but I'd expect some Rust level sign toxicity.
---
great to hear
---
I've been having the same problem for the last few days on Xbox too
---
Probably a stupid question, but is PA really that effective?  I can't even get near Whitesprings, the enemies are almost twice my level lol
---
Do events often. The quests in your pipboy are also good for exp. Make sure you kill anything you see as everything gives xp. If No one is there go to whitesprings and kill all the ghouls. If you are using melee even if they are max level you should be able to take them out.
---
Just wait for mods and private servers you’ll see all sorts of cool gamemodes
---
As requested.       http://imgur.com/Y7wHGok
---
I've gone to the main menu to attempt to re-friend him and it hasn't worked, he hasn't gotten the request but I'm willing to try again.
---
Yeah even if it says they’re still blocked. I blocked one particularly annoying PvP’er - you know the type, tiny penis - but keep getting dropped into sessions with them, even though it still says they’re blocked.
---
Yeah we just got on and tried to re friend each other and we aren’t getting the requests, for the record he didn’t hit “block for session” rather he just did the “block” button
---
Same here! Started a new game after 6 months of not playing it and I’m really enjoying it.
---
I’m guessing they just want every single game mechanic pointed out for them instead of that thrill when you discover an awesome game life-hack, then complain that there’s nothing new in the game to discover and work out
---
They'll take it down and tweak it for release. Cheats were too common on PC. I have a feeling level requirements will change or the level needed for the lore in vault 51 will be lowered. Did anyone manage level 110 to pick up some of the holotapes? The perk card system will need reworked too. I seriously doubt the random card for leveling will survive release.
---
Take your time, enjoy the experience and there’s double XP next week.
---
I’m 710 hours in and ‘only’ level 180 but this is my second toon, first one is level 70something.
---
Weird. Assume you’ve submitted a report?
---
where do you find the time to put the many hours in the game? Lol
---
I'm missing mine now :(, I loved gifting
---
SURPRISE!
---
Or at least some sort of a fast travel system.
---
You mean even a shitty pipe gun can be stupidly OP with twoshot and explosive and stacking rifle and pistol perks? You can keep arguing all you want but legendaries are the reason why pvp is unbalanced which is glaringly obvious in NW, there are supposed to be tiers of equipment, obviously pipe weapons / wood armor are at the bottom but even pipe weapons have a perk for them to make them more durable and wood armor has the shrouded mod for their niches. Legendaries make anything not legendary a joke, you can have Top tier T-60 fully moded and still die just as fast as if you weren't wearing anything to people with TSE. You can say whatever you want but that's just a fact deny it if you want you're the minority albeit an ignorant one, if you even think about why legendaries aren't in NW it should be obvious, but your more interested in winning a petty arguement then you care about game balance, so get stuffed lmao
---
Been playing since Beta :)
---
I think that was their aim, to make in game vendors bad so we are kinda forced to participate in that awful shrill that is, socialising with other players
---
Yeah, unfortunately Bethesda didn’t have a ticket genre for “Bethesda net is faulty and doesn’t come with basic multiplayer features” so I had to put it in the slightly off topic “character stuck” category so I doubt it’ll be answered
---
They’d think they should have that category, really
---
What’s your postal carrier’s name?
---
You got downvoted for this comment? I’ll give you an upvote
---
Get a mic. Talk to people gets easier as you go. If you're having trouble add me and you can practice on me.
---
Cranberry Relish (+10%XP)
---
Find the receip (maybe you're lucky and find it at a player vendor)
---
That would explain it lol, I've only been playing for a month and half or so
---
You can see in the challenges section of the main menu, killing 76 players is one of the challenges.
---
I got home around midnight from being away for three weeks. Man, that server was dead. I left knowing I was at max caps thinking when I got back I would start buying stuff from players. I probably seen three vendors total in the 2hrs I played tonight server hoping. I kept getting out on the same server multiple times. I did try the new content but didn’t want to get too involved since I got home super late.
---
Get ready for double XP from next Thursday (I think) :)
---
Seriously, or you'd think that they'd have the bare fucking minimum and have an "other" category, you know like every other fucking site that has a support tab has, guess Bethesda doesn't know how to make functioning games, launchers OR websites, big fucking shocker.
---
Thanks ;)
---
The company, Royal Mail.
---
The exact employee that posted this, not sure, want me to find out?
---
It's fallout, not call of duty or fortnite. They should leave it alone. Go play those other games if that's what you want. Just me opinion.
---
Why do I get resi vibes from this idea? Mercenaries to be more precise 😂

Aàahhhhhhhhhhh

I had terrible issues with it on PS4. On Xbox I’ve only had a few graphical glitches

---
I agree with you saying players shouldn’t be on the hud but I disagree with these people arguing against legendary gear, vats etc. you can’t argue when it’s in the game and it’s hard to get, people have it because it’s hard and lets face it, I’m a pvp player myself with god tier everything, but so is 70% of the pvp player base it’s only the 20% that don’t have the high tier armour and weapons or don’t have good builds and don’t use vats that argue. The majority of pvp players have good builds good weapons and utalise all options open to them. Also you can’t argue for no vats in pvp and no legendaries disallowing vats from pvp makes god tier legendaries more op since you can’t vats people like me running vanguard sentinal/assassin sentinal to kill us, a even playing field of a shoot out between me, in vanguard sentinal and a vampires explosive gat plasma, or any of my other god tier builds vs you with your 1* stuff will never be fair
---
It’s so refreshing to hear that it was peer pressure that made you quit. I wish more quitters were more honest like you. Kudos.
---
So, is hellfire armor something you can buy in the atom shop now?
---
That's why you need PA, it really helps
---
*cue 70's guitar music associated with nam*

Appalachia Now

Huh?
---
I guess I'll go and get one lol.
---
Ha! You thougt that was Minigun swinging mutie?
---
Nah ah - have a pipe pistol.
---
I couldn't find mine either. I simply chaulked it up to bug-esda fucking up again.
---
It's been missing for over a week
---
I'm... Not sure....?
---
Yeah, like:
---
Me: "Hey, gimme that cool fire axe!"
---
Scorched: "Aaand it's gone. Take that Bowie knife."
---
WTF?
---
You can get some T-51b it actually has the best damage resistance out of all PA :)
---
Dare you touchin' my beloved tesla 😂😂😂😂
---
no it doesn‘t
---
Display cases were supposed to come a while ago but unfortunately they were delayed due to issues. They're still coming and hopefully they're not too far away.
---
Wait... is the bull-barrel available for the .44 in 76? 
---
I have been looking around the internet with no luck
---
As an optional game mode I think it would be fun.  I love Fallout and the community that comes with it.  You don't have to play vs modes if you don't want to.
---
Nobody disagree's it just takes 9 years to pump it which is unacceptable tedium.
---
Is level 38 high enough to use it ? Lol
---
Really? Hopefully they’ll arrive soon. I’m really pumped to continue my journey in this game as a post apocalyptic bartender on the ass end of nowhere.
---
Damn VATS babies cant aim.
---
My worry is that adventure mode is now empty of high level players as all on NW. 
---
NW is fun but not the fallout a lot of us have grown to love. Depending on the money NW brings in will they focus the resources on that rather than adventure. I hope not. I have played 76 since launch and still love it. Looking forward to further adventures.
---
For science!
---
Yes, in 2 levels you can use X-01 it has only slightly less damage resist but the energy and rad resist is ALOT better
---
But you have to do the enclave quest first so just get some T-51b
---
It’s wonky, but I kind of like the idea of it being not only skill based, but luck based too. That way if someone is pro level, they may still miss. But that’s a personal opinion of mine, idk.
---
Team deathmatch would be dope.
---
What's that yellow bit? This thing looks genuinely nicer than we bargained for
---
Damn, they add centurion helmet but not the Ranger Outfit?
---
Don't worry, they'll put "C.A.M.P. Budget Space Extendors" in the Atom Store eventually....
---
i gotta say that people are starting being positive about the game
---
Maybe something to do with perk skills? Very strange.
---
A cap sink is required to prevent (slow down) inflation, yes it does.
---
Camp budget really confuses me. Some people's camps are huge and have every single decoration compared to mine which is half the size and at max budget. Some even have more turrets than me!!
---
Strangly I was at max budget but bought a few items from the atom store and leveled up a couple of levels. I went back to building and have a few percent spare to plop stuff down, not sure how this increased!
---
Never used VATS or aim with a tesla but ok :)
---
Im not worried about rads, I have hundreds of radaway lol
---
Get your friend to click your name on the friends list and click unblock. It's built into the game.
---
Either I haven't found the right one or it doesn't work for me.
---
you can't do nothing with that weapon unless you are up close and it's the damage output that make up for it. nerf the damage and it becomes useless garbage
---
They are for the adventure/survival modes. You do not have any of your equipment or perk cards or mutations or inventory in NW mode. You come naked, without anything and you have to find everything at start of every match in boxes all over the map. Weapons, armor, stimpacks, everything. No crafting there. The only think you can influence are perk cards. You get some at the beginning, then one more every level or as reward for completing tasks (instead of atoms - check them in your daily, weekly, character etc. task list - they start with NW). You can use 7 perk cards only, but you can combine them as you wish, even seven strength cards. But their total value can only reach the value you have on main character. If you have strength 7, you can use 7 perk 1 cards, 2x perk 3 plus 1xperk. but you cannot equip one perk 9 card. That and your way of playing is the only thing you can influence.
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure you’re that kind of guy who’s constantly getting his ass kicked in PvP and doesn’t have enough neurons to think about a counter build. 
---
I am that guy with a TSE and still got killed by more expert players who smartly built an anti explosive character. But apparently you will never be one of those. Even guys with full sentinel/assassin explosive weapons die constantly. But it takes skills not only with the aim and controller but also tactically and character build strategy but apparently that’s too much for your brain. Try Fortnite maybe.
---
I've got 23 repair kits that I got off the SBQ. I only used two so far and haven't bought a single one from the atom shop. People just want to complain about everything.
---
Exactly, tesla and explosives are the only ones that need NO vats. When i say "VATS babies" i mean the players from adventure that only use vats.
---
I just wanna decorate more...
---
Is 100 the cap??? Someone told me they saw a holotape that was 140 or 160.
---
Pve best options are vampire full health builds for every day+ mobs (only if your a auto build, works best when paired with vanguard sentinal) . Furious for boss fights (again only if auto, any armour). Power armour is still nice and quad is always a nice prefix, bloodied is only really good when paired with unyielding sentinal, and serendipity and is better in pvp then it is pve, my suggestions -quad or vampires explosive or FFR.
---
If you remember, in FO4 there wasn’t really a use for prewar currency either. Until the Nuka World DLC came out. In that DLC you could cash in the prewar money for game tokens. You then played the mini games to get tickets which were traded in at a “vending machine” for junk, aid items, armor, and weapons. 
---
Cashing in the prewar currency in exchange for items in those train station venders is a great idea. I think it would fit the lore either way. Either they were there before the war started like a Nuka Cola machine, or Sanjay and the responders built them to help survivors. 
---
As far as pricing the items, the price needs to be inflated. According to lore, inflation was already out of hand before the war. $35 for a doughnut and cup of coffee! How much would YOU charge someone post-war to go out, survive all those Scorched and monsters, find an actual unspoiled doughnut, and put it in a vending machine. I would think that $35 would increase two fold.
---
Yes, we need this. The atomic shop music is so unbearable. I'm in and out of there as quickly as possible.
---
I've tamed both a deathclaw and megasloth on separate occasions. Sadly they don't survive long at my c.a.m.p. just North of Watoga
---
Stims you could get away using less than 10 if any at all depending on your level
---
I agree, but it’s the really jerky animations that get me. One second your target is painted on your screen, the next second they left the area so fast it looked like they were sliding away. No chance to get a hit :/
---
It looks fine
---
Well I’m level 15 and when you reach the overseers office (lvl 10) there’s a terminal for level 90 something and a holotape for level 95.  Also there is a catwalk to another section of the vault requiring you to be level 100.
---
It was running fine on my i3 6100 with an r9 270x, subtracting the poor FPS that’s bound to come with such an old setup 😂 worst bug I had was that it deleted itself 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️😂
---
Unless done differently to other ES/FO games mannequins are a bitch.
---
They are not 'furniture', they are actually NPCs running a script that tells them to stay put.
---
This has two main gripes:
---
- The 'recursive' scripts tend to clog the papyrus VM which is... nasty.
---
- If the script misfires due to papyrus lag or any other extraneous influence the fuckers move in weird and unpredictable ways and suddenly you are playing Silent Hill, Fallout Edition.
---
I did solo launch nuke, killed 7 people and was 3rd. When in random team, we die like super fast. With friends we didn't get to finale once in 4hours game play. Agresive rushing = fast lose. Camping like bitch = better reward
---
Based on?
---
Go in atom shop and flag it (an icon should appear in the top left corner of the item window)
---
In the atomic shop hover over an outfit you bought and it will say if you want to favorite it for nuclear winter or not. You know it's working if you see a small nuclear bomb in the top left of the pic.
---
"This post reeks of someone that's a jobber, no friends besides virtually, doesn't go out much, takes gaming as their 2nd job through time consuming looter shooters"
---
Your highly mistaken, you don't know me bud, I've been gaming for over 25 years. I have worked my ass off in real life so my kids could have a great life. You know what? I made time to game aswell without stealing items from the developers regardless of the RNG or how bizzy I might be in real life. So what if others have move play time then you, if they put in more hours they deserve to have earned better drops. 
---
"in reality, this game is below average at best, no real incentive to play" 
---
Part of the reason that the game is below average is because of dupers just like you. Many people want to play the game as the developers intended it to be played. You feel it fair gameplay to new players that can't dupe that must put in hundreds of hours and still not mach your gear?  You devalue theire game play mate. Do you not have any values? Theft is Theft your stealing items that have not been intended to be released in that quantity. If Bethesda wanted a high RNG they would change it. Do you think it is ok to copy money in real life? Work for what you earn bro in life and in game. How do feel any sort of accomplishment in a game where you can just copy every item? That is not survival bud it is just lame.
---
My psn name is the same as my redit, I hope I run into you some time out in survival mode it is players just like you that I love to kill. If you happen to wreck me with your duped gear that's fine it is fine if you feel good about it. It's not going to hurt my feelings at all. I'll know I played the game with some integrity and you choose not.
---
I don't know for sure. the fact that any of us here can acknowledge the probable existence of shills means there's also a probable existence of the opposite. The fact that you're close minded and naive enough to not even consider the possibility of such a thing says a lot about you.
---
Yeah. I remember those really creepy glitches in my house in Skyrim when those guys were moving about.
---
I too still hope that adventure mode is the main stage and doesn't become a side note.  Perhaps the modes I mentioned could be occasional events within adventure.
---
Cant keep splitting the player base. So no.
---
It has decent range. Also generally the gunfights are always close. If you are out ranged with the tesla thats you fault for engaging so far away.
---
I played adventure last night and it was full pf people. Low levels with probably 4 or 5 vendors but it was full. People are playing it.
---
'merica
---
Oh wow, I figured it out. I must have misremembered and I didn't remove herd mentality because it is there now, I just joined a party. I swear I couldn't see it earlier when I went through my mutations. 
---
And you know what? I left the party and it disappeared from my list of mutations.. But apparently it still has an effect, but only -1? It says it should be -2 when I group up..
---
Reporting it as a bug anyway..
---
Had it set off. Didn't know the hotkey at the time. But rebooted my game after fixing a windows setting and it works now.
---
Like if you are running around like a fool sprinting from spot to spot shooting at ghouls they should swap your weapon for a melee and put chains on you feet.. just to even it up
---
That’s nothing to do with the bag. Just something on the table where I took the pic. The bag is top quality.
---
Well could be just me but since i'm more into lore and discovering but the 2 min in the vault is way to less. As i said - it's my tought.
---
But your point is right that the triple loading could be a pain.
---
rank 11 i think holotape is in medbay.
---
Imagination.
---
Seems fine to me.
---
Power armour, all rise, perks to match and 15 minutes. Easiest way to nuke a lot.
---
What about, for the ammo ones, putting some ultracite ammo in there, but randomized.
---
So maybe the whitesprings one has regular ammo (at a much lower cost of course) and some ultracite .45 ammo.  Watoga might have regular ammo and .50 and 40mm ultracite ammo.  And it switches on daily reset.
---
Maybe sell gunpowder and/or bulk lead as well.
---
Or, and hear me out on this, make the ammo vending machines BUY ammo as well.  I can't count how much fusion and plasma ammo I've just dropped because I had no need for it, same with .38 ammo.  Even if it's just selling at 1 cap per 10 rounds, it would be a way to offload some ammo instead of dropping it.  Or, make the ammo trade only.  Something like 10 .38 rounds trade for one .50 round .  Though, I'm not sure how it could be implimented for all ammo to have differing trade values without bethesda having some kind of bug in there.
---
The medical ones... I'm not sure about them.
---
People should be shamed if the cheating is confirmed with proof, I know it's only a rule because of the Reddit TOS, but that needs changed.
---
Thanks that makes sense!!! Time to grind lol
---
Saaaaame. I don't wanna spend my atoms bc I'm paying for DOO Do DOO DOODOODOO
---
Over 9000
---
Oh thank God something tangible.
---
Yeah, I have even heard that you can’t turn your head while moving and shooting any spinning guns, because apparently it shoots no bullets.
---
Maybe because it was a weekday and I didn’t get home til midnight. Just never seen it so empty before.
---
I agree, I'm all for it!
---
I love this idea!! 👍
---
There's still people, just different people far as I've seen. Less of the supertraders around whitespring and more people fresh outta the vault. It's a very different pace but a super fun world still
---
5. oh my god i want that !!! alterac valley. Please.
---
I've lost count how many times I've done everything for the event and other people just sit around doing nothing, so in cases like that yes I will sit on the roof and 1-shot the legendary.
---
Congrats! 
---
But i'm curious - was it shipped in a nylon bag?
---
Emphasis on bullshit in Reddit will increase.
---
The grind: Go to west tek, massacre green faces, join another friends server, repeat.  You want 3 friends online to cycle between so add some random people.
---
But you should just complete the main quest and get to level 50 first, hard to grind the high level areas without legendary gear.
---
Just intuition (imagination, maybe). The blueprints comment is based off of Bethesda's comments earlier today. As for it going F2P, the game is retailing for $10-20, this would put it at the right price range for F2P players to consider the sunk cost of time played on NW sufficient to justify their purchase of the full game to gain the benefits of the xp, caps, blueprints, cosmetics. 
---
Absolutely could be wrong, and that's alright.
---
I hope vault 51 in adventure will be fucking raid, because i am tyred of ZAX talking to me. It will be so sweet to hit that motherfucker with sledge hammer.
---
Hey that's awesome, welcome!
---
If you see a player acting kinda strange there's a good chance they've left a brown paper bag full of cool stuff for you for free. 
---
People started doing this so much that they added in a "free gift" emote!
---
Can easily launch a nuke while drink 50 nuka Cola.
---
Is this a competition i don't get?
---
Yeah, people tried to attack Ox, which sucks cause he seems like a genuinely decent fella. And he wasn't alone, as a huge fan of Bethesda I was on the "Be patient" wagon, even if I was sceptical about the online play. And the amount of people within my social circle who would reply to my hopefulness with "You're stupid, Bethesda *insert thing you saw on YouTube here*" all of which was usually unfounded, over exaggerated or just plain wrong.
---
Nuka Tapper is the only classic mode i can relate to.
---
Wrong, its one of the 3 Inferno versions.
---
Anyone know if the outcast armour works lore wise? Just curious
---
The sprinkles on the second ‘Slocum Joe’ skin have me screaming ‘I NEEEEED IT’
---
Had this the other day. Hopped out to the main menu and back in and it worked.
---
Alright thank you for the info and help. I tried searching multiple things and I guess that post never showed up.
---
Reading this waking up the day after we layed my nana to rest, a true matriarch with 7 children, 17 grandchildren, and oodles of great great grandchildren.
---
The time we get to love people may seem short but it isn't the time we spend with them that matters most it's the tools they bestow upon us just by being themselves, A good parent/grandparent will provide you with everything you need to be set for life.
---
No one is ever really gone whilst there is someone there to remember there name and tell stories about the times they shared. Speak of them often and proudly, not sadly that they have passed but thankful that they lived... At least that's my little opinion of it all.
---
You have my heart.
---
Once i was doing something and map didn't show to me, so i was not able to chose where is spawn. Other time i was taking speed shit, but it wasn't as fast as i thought.

radicool perk for extra strength = more dmg with DCG. I use an instigating DCG with all mutations, perks and unyielding armor it kills almost everything in 1 blow.
---
First real answer around here lol, everyone else get's upset because they can't accept their favorite loadout is broken. Could be but I didn't know the public could use them on PS4 already
---
I’m not sure, I just know that I get insta-killed to anyone with a spinning weapon, so it’s likely not that much of a problem
---
ooooohhhh shiet... Yongyea's not gonna be happy about this
---
If you manage to get into the controlroom then good job, but you have to clear and defend that last part or you wont be able to lunch a nuke.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Wait what
---
I want those nasty skins, then i will happily stop playing NW, bcos i got so angry yesterday i broke my telephone with controler i throw away. In game i won't hit single shit, but in real life i do hit tiny telephone with controller, like what the fuck, why do i even live?
---
I don't know how we made it through the great canvas shortage, but we did.
---
Xbox
---
And to setup a trade route in between each led by your own mr handy
---
Hmm odd. I see people on my games but they are mostly low levels I guess of people trying it out.
---
I could be wrong on this, but im doing the Same with Fusion cores. Nearly depleted pa cores into fresh prime Fusion cores for my ultracite gatling laser....
---
However it draws Fusion cores from my stash... So I have to Drop them on the Floor or Put them in a world box... Just a heads up
---
Can we get some Photos of it?
---
Kill enemies.
---
I have a 1st or 2nd Gen beater Xbox, And honestly, it ran decently for me, lotsa crashes, but not enuff to deter me. And since all the fixes Bethesda has done, it now runs with a solid 80-90% stability. That's something alot of ppl tend to overlook, just how much Bethesda has actually repaired what was wrong.
---
Can easily launch a nuke while playing beer tapper.
---
it's clunky but think it's better than pubg imo. that game fuking doesn't let me do what i want to do
---
Can I buy a helmet
---
Even that i dont get your logic you can rename your Fallout76Custom.ini to whatever you like, start the game and you're fine.
---
NW doesnt "wipe" your ini...
---
r/youpostonthedonald

You're a bunch of cheater supporting Bethesda shills!  I bet you spend all your time duping pipe pistols!
---
It was my first time on in three weeks plus it was a weekday and I didn't get on til after midnight. Many factors there. Just my initial observation from being gone for awhile
---
I have a ryzen 2600 and having the same problem. I turn off some of the cores and it runs well now
---
In fallout 4 you could find ghouls in them, so technically you would be able to survive. The question is, at what cost?
---
Can easily launch a nuke while take a snap of Grahm at a workshop.
---
Yeah my absolute dumbass of a friend decided to unfriend me too
---
Such a long thread about this. I am liking the response from players because last night I burned through 4 fusion cores fairly quickly. My character is a high Agi/Luck Pistoleer that relies on building crit in Vats. 
---
I have concentrated fire and I usually aim for a weak point. Mainly the head with most targets. So that my accuracy gets better with each consecutive hit. I am able to do high damage crits as well as build my crit bar fairly fast. I wasn't even using a legendary weapon to get myself through the area. I used just a modded 10MM, a Pipe Revolver, and a black powder pistol.   (I'll soon be getting to use some level 50 legendaries to make things easier on myself)
---
I was doing a solo silo run in my fancy high level PA last night. I thought I was doing okay, but then I looked at my FC count and I was down to 1. I asked friends on social media asking about it and sure enough, any actions in a PA will drain the fusion core faster. Obviously I am going to do the silo run without a PA and use trouble shooter armor and other sets I have to survive. With a hazmat suit for some of the radiation parts of it of course.
---
It does seem a bit excessive in the amount it drains. Considering the end game silo I was doing few would bat an eyelash at my problem and just say either use normal armor or stock up on more Fusion Cores. Needless to say, outside of an end game silo run, it does seem to drain more than its worth. Has Bethesda responded to this in any way?
---
I will be following this thread and reading for feedback. thanks!
---
Had a few people trying to be raiders and shoot me a bunch of times a while back with explosive laser auto shotguns. I spammed the cooking emote a while, stashed my junk, and took their ringleader out before getting massacred. Told them to make snacks not war and left
---
Shit up. I’m so sick of hearing people calling for boycotts because there’s something in game they don’t like. People can spend their money how they choose, they aren’t beholden to your personal preferences
---
If you decide to buy an outfit, make sure it's an actual outfit rather than underarmor. You can't wear underarmor in NW!
---
Why not both?
---
What Plattform are you using? If on pc, make sure you set you mic as standart input device in the audio options.
---
The game mode is 10000% about communication, or just queue solo.
---
Can i just have more turrets? I picked a swamp next to camden fun fair and those scorched bozos keep coming over for a looksee.
---
u/Syllius2 this!
---
Had the same thing happening, it randomly started working again the next day.
---
They do have a way to unblock people but I'm not entirely sure how on pc
---
Stop being a cunt, learn to manage the space you have!
---
Yes! I want a billboard but I already made a giant robot! No space left!
---
I support you in this entirely, it's a shame i'm on pc so i cannot stop by. I wish you a good time in Appalachia.
---
Pc, and ill try that
---
You can't sell items bought in the store. And yes, it's craftable
---
In a pinch you can put up the gray lady statue. If got one staring out the top floor of my window camp, backlit. Looks like a haunted house in the mire
---
But if it's craftable, can't you craft one and sell it?
---
Not sure about that...
---
It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
---
I would definitely like to see more objective based pvp stuff like capture the flag. They'd need a battle royal queue, then an "obejctive pvp queue" to keep all the non battle royal ones in one queue and have it be random, or the player base will be too split.
---
It means it's got a different feature set than the final product.
---
The idea of beta testing is that you start beta testing when all the features in the final product are implemented, but maybe buggy. You run beta tests, fix the bugs, rerun the tests, rinse, repeat.  The last beta version and the final product are supposed to be identical.
---
I mean, I sometimes  hit up the U-Mine-It machines (I don't know if I'd call them useful, but they're fun), but yeah, I haven't bothered with any of the others since finding out you can get infinite stimpaks from workshop defense quests.
---
And it's never made any sense for pre-war vending machines to take post-war currency anyway.
---
Thanks for the explanation, still odd for me to have this in the shooter mode of the RPG.
---
Like I said, no. It does not appear in the trading menu. Neither player nor vendor trading is possible
---
Oh hm. Okay. Thanks for clearing that up! I was really wondering haha
---
A chest that could hold even just 50 pounds and can be shared by you characters would be cool.
---
I agree. Was watching shroud for a while last night. He was the top live channel with 25k viewers playing fallout 76. It’s too bad dr disrespect is on a temporary ban bc I’m sure he would have teamed up with shroud for a round or two. Would have given us even more visibility.
---
Happens for me when I join a EU/NA server from a LFG. It takes about 3-5 minutes for power armour to load, bags to show on the group and enemies to not be invisible. When I just "join" a world and connect to OCE servers load time is &lt;1 min.
---
I agree, though some recipes currently do call for purified water.
---
Have you tried resetting your NAT on your console?
---
TSE shotguns are still good in vats.
---
Concentrated Fire, high AP, VATS crits to the head.
---
I got a syringer today that turns things you kill into friendly bloatflies that fight for you. Crazy, right?
---
Conan Exiles too. Need mods to have it there. I'm glad it's not there. Immersion breaking af to me.
---
Burn her anyway!!!
---
I have NAT type 2, as far as I know it is the best option to have, my console has its own static IP adress.
---
I don't know how to reset NAT, to tell the truth...
---
I resemble that remark!!!
---
Rose isn't a radio host, does she even play music? I honestly can't stand her so I never even turn top of the world radio station on due to how annoying she is.
---
Yes, I had the same thing a few days ago. I knew that the wendigo was a level down stairs and was pretty  supprised to see him  come with the elevater! I finally shot him down though the elevate door.
---
Yes, if you all congregate in one area it will be easier to cleanse Appalachia. 
---
/rp
---
I’m torn. On one hand I agree with you and it’s an awesome lobby to explore. I like the holotapes and terminals to explore and there’s a ton to look at. 
---
On the other, I get shot in the face within 2 minutes and have to wait another 5 for another game.
---
No, they posted a PM which can easily be sent to yourself to drum up sympathy. If you've been on reddit long you'd remember the drama people used to try to pull with that, send obscene messages to themselves through alts to make them look like the victim.
---
Are you part of the new wave? Fallout 76 is vastly more complicated than most of shooters are. In the base game, there are lots of different systems you can use to define your build and your characters. My Survival PvP character is revolved around these sneak effects, legendary modifications and invisibility boost effects. They are present, albeit vastly less complicated in NW. Its still early days of NW hence the people keep adjusting, but after the sneak peek ends, everybody will do what you have to do anyway in Fallout - will be crouching.
---
😮
---
I don't remember hearing much about the everquest person. I do remember a bunch of pictures of some guys setup him and his GF ran on wow with like 8 screens on each PC both of them multiboxing enough characters to "2 man" a whole 40 person raid, back when those were a thing in WoW. I'll see if I can find it, it was nuts.
---
"I'm just pointing out that the negativity around this game is at an all-time high". I don't have any proof, but I am "pointing it out" so it's cool and valid.
---
Thank you very much for the picture. It looks great. 
---
I hope it eases your burdens in Appalachia.
---
If you compare exp you get from events and exp from kills, ocus on killing. There is no point spent ages trying to bring down Scorchbeast ... it is not ammo/time/effective. So:
---
Best target: Ghoul 
---
Part to target: Head
---
Gun: anything with high oneshot damage .. adjust this according to your level, you should oneshot. 
---
Areas: Whitespring golf course, Harpers Ferry sewers, One violent night event. 
---
How you achieve oneshot kill is up to you. You can melle them, you can sneakshot them. You can melle them from sneak :) Important is they coming fast, dying fast, and they plenty.
---
AS you play you will find other areas suitable for this, best is to combine resuply run with exp run. You just need to balance your "way", so you dont run of ammo, stimpacks, radaway or so. I have autorifle build, but since ammo is pain, for many areas I use instigating revolver without any perks and I dont have waste main weapon ammo for trash mobs.
---
For the longest time I thought it was, like, a regular-ass fountain. Then I actually looked it up and it’s a *drinking* fountain. No wonder I’d never seen it.
---
Yeah it varies from person to person my guy. No need to get all flustered over this.
---
Yessssss!
---
No prob
---
Are you on PC?
---
I am new to streamers but I have to say I enjoyed watching shroud. I wish they would use blue prints more though. He lost a game early because the other team was using them. They give an advantage during the final round.
---
"Just use a mic you looser"
---
Argh
---
That just makes too much sense! Get out of here with that logic!
---
If there was only ONE scope, then we wouldn’t need to farm as much which means we don’t play as much!
---
Ephew
---
Exactly what i meant.
---
I really hope they might open vault 51 in adventure to explore it and maybe get a shortcut to join the mode without exit and re entry all over.
---
RPG
---
Look at https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-change-nat-type-on-ps4/
---
Yes as long as stats aren't public else this will turn into another BR sweat fest.
---
I posted this 2 months ago, think I actually know it isn't a pay to win item now lol, tbh Bethesda fixed the 200% buff ages ago making such items as repair kits  only effect durability now
---
They could make it more difficult to learn or obtain  :L
---
I agree. I also needed so many times a Wait, don't run away emote.
---
:/ I'm going to take that as a no, and also that sucks.
---
I am in process of getting another XBox for the same reason.  My son plays all these other FPS games but I am horrible at them but with FO76 being a slower paced FPS I am way better and there for can keep up with him.
---
Yea thanks tho
---
I posted about this earlier and that's the sort of shit I got.  For some reason there's a lot of people against this even though it would only have a positive affect on the game.
---
It would be cool to see a picture of it op. Did it come with any extra stuff, or just the bag?
---
I’d be happy to just be able to plop a fire down when I’m the middle of nowhere to cook some food and drink.
---
" **4)** There are two ways you can change your PS4 NAT Type. One is to [**put it to the DMZ**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-change-nat-type-on-ps4/#a), which can be a dangerous method. The other is to [**open up some forwarding ports**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-change-nat-type-on-ps4/#b). You can click one of the links to go to the method you want to choose. " I've already tried both of those methods, but thanks for the info.
---
Maybe you don't understand why there's a stash limit. Maybe you didn't play back in the days of only 400lbs. There's a reason why it's capped, if you want to keep all that stuff you're talking about then manage your stuff better.
---
This has already been discussed and i think that it is currently in the works. It was discussed like 2 or 3 paths ago I believe.
---
And hackers are already playing it and it will spread.
---
I know, and that's why I don't care about CAMP exploits, but that's only one definition, you can cheat the system as well, you don't always have to be gaining an advantage over another person when cheating.
---
You can easily launch a nuke by launching a nuke, then you can launch nukes while you launch a nuke.
---
It's not negative, the minus symbol just means that stat is debuffed but stats don't go below 1.
---
What platform are you on? Rank 34 on Ps4 here and haven't noticed any strange movement or weapon bugs.
---
Remember that some guns (such as the gatling gun) do not have 100% first-shot accuracy when aiming down sights, and that the sprint animation never renders for other players even when spectating.
---
I use VATS just to find targets in Adventure, BR I am dead before I can even see where they are.
---
You're in Adventure Mode, right?
---
Can't hurt people unless they attack you, or they have a bounty.
---
There's 3 ways to become legit invisible (Stealthboys, Chameleon Mutation or Armour).
---
So, what's the bug?
---
You aren’t asking for a discussion. You’re calling for the player base to boycott until you get what you. You are acting like a whiny, entitled child. 
---
You don’t get to take the high ground now.
---
Yep, I believe it's just marketing. Making the hype during the free trial week. 
---
No other reason for not keeping Nuclear Winter on while working on it.
---
800 stash limit, which coincides with your vending machines.
---
Weapons and armor still break down but there's way to make them last longer.
---
It's rarely a player that does this, 10/10 cases its have seen myself it has been hostile creature. For example mire has those anglers who turn your brahmin into beef in 0.4 seconds.
---
Camp budgets aren’t arbitrary. They are capped because of server restrictions.
---
Let’s compromise and just add one additional end game scope!
---
That’s not “reasonable” at all, that’s really fucking entitled. I know it’s the meta to sell legendaries, but people are not obligated to sell you what you want.
---
I was recently one of these witch hunt posters and just deleted my thread. I had a video with user IDs uncensored.
---
My friend and I have reported to Bethesda however on our first attempt, Bethesda auto emailed us back saying our report had nothing in it - no writeup about the aimbot, no photo of the user id, no video we had both uniquely attached. I replied with a YouTube link as I posted it to my channel.
---
It would be nice to hear from our community leader that these reports are being received and actively pursued, eg. BAN THE CHEATERS, and fix the door they are implementing cheats through! We love NW but this mode is hard enough without aimbot and wall hack. I can accept defeat from better players, not tool assisted babies.
---
By the love of Atom the 400lbs times lol that was tough...
---
Please end it and fix up the cheating before release.
---
How about a "Wait" emote? Sometimes you might want to dig through your inventory/stash or craft something to gift or trade. Or something comes up and you want someone to know you didn't ditch them.
---
The all rise gives +10 hp (which is about +2.5% hp), and weighs 5 lbs less than a regular sledgehammer. Which means it deals exactly the same damage as a non-legendary sledgehammer.
---
It really isn't a good weapon considering the available legendary effects such as bloodied, anti armor and furious lol :/
---
I have been a professional database administrator for more than 20 years, so I have a fair idea. 
---
I also started with the 400lb limit along with the rest of the beta participants.
---
Regardless, continual ATOM shop purchases are incompatible with budgets that it seems most players are unhappy with.
---
I simply can't use everything I've bought, and as time goes on, players could spend money on things they can't use, but why would they?
---
I killed one today. I obtained his wing, which was a relic I used to advance a quest I don’t need to finish
---
cranberry relish and plenty of sleep lv 215 here, no need to rush things I think lv 38 in 50 hours sounds good. I have well over 1000 hours since beta
---
My guy will start wearing the witches hat with his cop outfit.
---
Here’s a thought.  Maybe your friend actually left you blocked and just told you it’s not working? 
---
Jk, lol.
---
That it was none of those
---
Switch to a bloodied melee build and get a good bloodied swingspeed melee weapon. 1deag everything (even a combat knife works for this), loot, and fasttravel to the next location.
---
Don't forget to sleep in a bed every 2 real world hours for +5% xp.
---
Guns weak. Melee strong.
---
Yeah, the only feasible way to collect water is from a body of water. otherwise you get like 3 a minute from the tap. Unfortunately my camp is over toxic water (but I love the spot), so I have to travel to get dirty water.
---
Honestly, I reworded my original title from "I" to "players", and edited the post accordingly, which I guess was a mistake. 
---
The fact remains that if 1000 or 5000 members upvote any comment or suggestion, Bethesda does take note.
---
Don't underestimate the power that the player community has.
---
Name calling is neither productive nor permitted.
---
Wasn't able to find the one I was looking for but here is a guy running 107 WoW accounts at the same time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH7PMY2Uo1s
---
Wait, are you saying that doesn't work???
---
This is what I want so bad for vendor reasons
---
Very close to the tennis court that is in front of the golf clubhouse there is a small dome roofed and pillared structure. Just inside the perimeter of this structure there is a small drinking fountain. Its small and you can easily walk past it without seeing it. Drink from it (do not collect water) and it will cure any disease you have.
---
Well when you’ve collected the mats or want to buy the flux from me hit me in game    sfsoldier
---
You'll also get a wicked case of heartburn if you lunch a nuke.
---
that’s awesome, I haven’t played since the launch months and the game feels way better to play. even the battle royal was fun
---
I agree that it would be nice to have the limits increased but boycott posts are some of the dumbest and least constructive bullshit on this sub.
---
would be great to get more outfits that would also fit well with the deathclaw gauntlet and sheepsquatch weapons, i’ve been using the imposter outfit because it’s pretty well designed and looks great with my deathclaw gauntlet but some variety would always be welcome. and not just helmets, whole outfits would be awesome.
---
i also love the skull on my raider excavator’s helmet.
---
That person was joking
---
Thanks for all the tips folks. Appreciate it.
---
Man of culture.
---
Yea can't say I believe you till I see that pic. 
---
Remind me when you post that pic. Because I'm interested to see what it's like.
---
I'd prefer K/D. The amount of kills might just reflect the time played. K/D however shows skill!
---
Also a stash increase would be nice, while we're at it
---
We have system flair do we not
---
Server restrictions, aka fields and records, are definable.
---
If Bethesda does not wish to devote additional resources to databases, they have to reconcile this with reduced sales in the ATOM shop.
---
I am offering feedback that I cannot buy more items because my budgets are full.

Are you paid by Bethesda?
---
I wish
---
Just remove the free demo
---
This! Make it an even 1000 instead of the current 800.
---
I have to apologize for coming across that way. 
---
My point was that we have the power to send a message that sales could be increased by increasing budgets.
---
Don't remember the name of the place, somewhere in the Forest.
---
My camp is in whitespring and even with a beefy pc, the stuttering / fps drop is a huuuge issue. Ive lost so many fights because of this.
---
Xb1. I’m not talking about bugs, I just mean the overall animations in the game engine. They are too jerky/clunky. The movement isn’t smooth at all, it’s very broad/direct. Notice how a player in another game can be easy to hit when he’s moving back and forth, and in this game it’s significantly harder to hit them. Some people don’t notice it though and I have no other way of describing it
---
Thanks mate.
---
Then they need to upgrade their servers. Seriously, this isn't the 90's. They aren't pushing the limits of server architecture, thousands of other games have no issue with much larger servers without arbitrary  restrictions on players inventories.
---
Hell, MINECRAFT servers handle it better, and that is a decade old JAVA game. Go look up 2b2t to get an idea of what servers are capable of. They literally can handle 200+ players at a time and the map on that server is larger than the actual size of earth.
---
It's part of a balanced breakfast with a deathclaw omelette and some awesome opossum bacon.
---
I played that game only once and I still love its animations and movement more than this one. (and I hate that game)
---
Also i had difficulty getting stuff like springs to repair everything. Anything changed on this end?
---
Adventure is not empty, far from it. There's just more low levels because of froob's week and a lot of people are trying the new thing, just as they did with every previous bit of new content. Also, the same 'not Fallout' argument could be made for every game in the series from 3 onwards.
---
What other way would you recommend to get bethesda to actually upgrade their servers to be on par with every other online game?
---
I mean as it stands their servers are unable to handle things even minecraft servers are capable of handling, and that is a game that was coded by a single person 10 years ago in JAVA.
---
Toxic troll
---
The build you present here is definitely well-arranged in terms of "maxium damage over a minimum amount of time," but I think that in practical terms you'll find that there's certain utilitarian perks that you just can't go without. Without a level or two of First Aid, you're going to find that when a fight goes badly, it'll go really badly really fast, for instance. And basically everyone winds up keeping "Thru Hiker" and "Walking Pharmacy" most of the time because it's so hard to carry around enough aid items and chems without them to really get by. 
---
I think that these are all good perks to aim to have, and if you have the luxury of opportunity to equip them all just before the shit gets real, then good on you, but for day to day use, you shouldn't spurn the utility of things like Green Thumb and Butcher's Bounty, you know?
---
o o f
---
I received mine today too!
---
Just report him for uncivil post and he will get banned. The mods are on it with toxic people.
---
Yeah it would be nice if they added a way to reduce the aim deadzone!
---
The scoped lever rifle is the only sniper rifle worth using, the others have awful damage.
---
Lol didn't see this before I posted the same suggestion, but yes that would also be a great use for it.
---
A T-posed ghoul at the White Springs Resort.
---
Ranks in this mean jack shit. Perk cards don’t do as much as people think.
---
Yeah I got the Raider Excavator too but that's only really ever worm when I go to ~~worship the boss~~ farm Lucky Hole Mine
---
Yeah whitesprings can really take a hit to your fps with all the enemies and robot NPCs. It's also a hotspot for camps and other players.
---
I’m about to do the same, I’m only level 5 but loving it, I mainly play solo, could someone recommend me a good SPECIAL build?
---
That would basically make the NW mode horrible if it remained F2P. Have you not been paying attention to the massive amount of hacking going on in it currently? People flying above and below the map shooting 40 rounds from revolvers and taking out entire teams with one clip from aimbots and wallhacks.
---
my laptop’s nowhere near a high end gaming pc so sometimes the lag and framerate drops make it almost unplayable especially in vault 51, some areas in whitespring bunker, the entirety of whitespring golf club and resort and dyer chemical interiors. 
---
when starting a new match of nuclear winter i have to go as far from the middle of the lobby as i can or i can even miss choosing the spawn point because the fps drops to less than 5 in some areas so it doesnt load everything on my screen fast enough.
---
I can put a mega sloth by my name but not PC as far as I know.
---
You can say that again
---
Pretty sure you get double meat on "critters" too during verdant, at least you used to. 
---
Green thumb and butchers bounty make things pretty easy to bulk up on food and cure crafting.
---
Marine armor does go above the wetsuit.
---
Yeah for sure i did notice that.
---
Wait, Free for a week? Like you can get the game for free on this week or it's only free for this week and you have to buy it after that?
---
What about teaching low level players how to milk a brahmin blind folded with their hands behind their backs?
---
Gotta buy it after this week is up.
---
Supposedly they are working on collaborative "town" work spaces, so that's likely to happen just not as a part of CAMP system.
---
Yeah i will probably notice that when i play tonight. I work third shift so im pretty sure its going to be lile my own server lol.
---
Man... silt beans in tato sauce, a fasnacht sausage and a fresh mutfruit juice.
---
level 151 and never knew this.
---
Oh crap it does. My game must have glitches before again. I thank you for this comment :)
---
Wish I had one to grab. No friends playing currently.
---
Thank you for your advice, what would you swap out to accommodate these perks? or would you swap them in when needed etc.? thank you again for the help.
---
Well that is disappointing for a lot of players.
---
I bought it on the first day and well....you get the idea.
---
So is everyone making fortnite based games now?
---
I was doing some research on frequent disconnects in fallout 76, am and wondering exactly how frequent the disconnect happens.  I have an initial theory, but need more data.
---
I suspect the disconnects will happen to you at specific intervals.  The next time you play and have the issue, can you note the time, then the next time, and determine the interval (within the same play session) please?  I suspect that over time it’s happening every X minutes or something.
---
Serious question, not joking.
---
Ahh, damn, if I would have known sooner! Thanks for the tip, if it should happen again, I know what to do :)
---
what system do you use?
---
They need to make it a toggle, where you can decide whether an outfit is under armor or goes over the top and covers everything. Clipping issues be damned.
---
You're right. 
---
But seeing them, after having a nukashine, on the map is more enjoyable.
---
That... That's how you win in battle. You wait for the right moment.
---
Hm, I wonder how Outcast paint is in the game in 2102
---
No you are on to something my friend. It was roughly 20 mins each time. Then it was an hour in between getting disconnected. This was the other day rather then yesterday which was psn issue i believe. Also i think if the game bugs out and sends 5 diffrent groups of enemies at you at once then it disconnects too
---
Got the game 2 weeks after release for 30 bucks, game have bugs which sometimes made me grumpy but only server disconnect made me stop for few days to cool down the loss of all my junk or legendary items but always came back with a smile and always something to do.
---
Replace TV 🥊
---
I think that your mutation might be a bit bugged, I'm sure it's beneficial though.... But they were having an issue with unseen stacks that kept adding up over long stretches with plague walker. I think it had to do with the changes they made to disease countera that would leave residual stacks occasionally when a player would leave game diseased but come back with disease cured, or disease reapplied, making it either double stack per disease or never trigger the remove stack when disease naturally times out in game.
---
Yeah I thought of that. I just thought the outfit system would be even better because you can wear that shoulder pad you love so much when you’re actually wearing an ugly yet fat more powerful one
---
At level 18, I’ve found four I can listen to. There’s one behind the curtain where the music instruments are. One on the bar downstairs. One in the clinic downstairs by the vision test charts. And one on the second floor in a bathroom. I forget what level they each are. Also, if you get the frog legs perk, you can reach the lvl 30 area above the theater without being lvl 30. There’s a holotape up there for lvl 41 iirc
---
Where do you find the challenge lists by the way? Rng screwed me over, lv16 with just a pistol damage perk as it keeps giving me duplicates so I wouldn't mind getting at least a chance at something decent apart from carry weight perks 
---
:(
---
I try to wear them in the lobby every time but they're on top of one of the lockers and I think the only item you can take in the vault
---
Thanks, it's encouraging that some members are more informed.
---
Sometimes the clipping actually looks awesome.
---
I had a temporary visual glitch with my travelling leather coat where my marine armor chest was clipping through, and it surprisingly looked good.
---

There have not been added more rare components, but you will have a surplus once you stop getting better weapons and armor every 2-3 level. I were all out of most untill I went over level 50.
---
There is also locations where you can grab many items containing screws, like clipboards in offices.
---
I appreciate that.
---
PvP!
---
In your social menu and your friends list they will be down at the very bottom ugly online players they will be a darker color and it'll say blocked simply click on them and unblock them....    I've done it before
---
This post certainly could use more attention. I'm surprised it isn't one of the top things, much as I do enjoy seeing all of the 'I was wrong about Fallout 76' posts.
---
Cya won’t miss ya
---
What did you do to become wanted?
---
I agree with your message then. We should let them know but my communicating with the community managers here.
---
It looks like anchor farm just west of vault 76!
---
Its not the camps its whitespring itself ... even when there are no camps im droping frames left and right .. I have a rtx2080 and dont even get 60 fps there...
---
Lmao. 1st give me an example of something relevant to this game that official minecraft servers are capable of that this isnt. 2nd, we could communicate with the community managers here.
---
Yep, received mine today and the quality does seem to be quite good.
---
Absolutely. That was 100% accurate. I give new players surplus resources and plans I already know and "sell" ammo my main weapon doesn't use for free at my vendor.
---
A lot of these perks won't even be available until you reach higher levels anyway, and you won't really be able to use power armour or most energy weapons until you're at least level 20, so in practical terms, I'd suggest investing in a few more-practical perks along the way. The five which I named - First Aid, Green Thumb, Butcher's Bounty, Thru Hiker and Walking Pharmacy - are such basic utility perks that I'd suggest investing in each of them along the way; they're as useful to a level 300 character as they are to a level 1 character. 
---
I'd say that there's no reason to keep ammosmith equipped when you're not actively crafting ammo, so that's one to swap in and out depending upon whether or not you're currently at a tinker's workbench. Those two slots can go towards Thru Hiker. Class Freak isn't as big a deal as you might think; most mutations' negative effects aren't a big deal, and I never bother to equip it: I just make sure not to get the few mutations whose effects (like twisted muscles) can be crippling. Similarly, I only ever put on Super Duper while I'm crafting things, and leave it off the rest of the time. 
---
If it were up to me, I'd move a few SPECIAL stats out of luck, and instead get charisma up to 9 (which allows you to share level 3 perks with team-mates when you're in a team, which is a huge boon), and consider getting Lone Wanderer for when you're on your own and bodyguards for when you're in a team. Especially if your endurance is going to be as low as this, getting perks which improve your damage resistance is important. 
---
It's also likely worthwhile to keep an eye on the Action Boy/Action Girl perk, since heavy guns tend to drain AP pretty quickly, and having a perk which causes your AP to regenerate more swiftly is good for using them in VATS, if that's on your mind.
---
Nope you're just an ass.
---
The stash has been made 600pnds heavier since release. If you're not happy with that don't play.
---
It says sneak peak, I can't imagine that they are going to just rip it out of the game especially with how much people love it. I personally do not think it is going away after the trial and in fact we will actually get a full release of it with possibly another map and more stuff. They have not confirmed either way though I am pretty sure. But this is my hope.
---
Yeah, unfortunately from all the negativity from the shitty launch of this game has pretty much made this sub VERY hostile to anyone who doesn't sing endless praise on this game. They react without really thinking or even reading whole posts if they are deemed "part of the hate bandwagon" regardless of if the issue is valid or not ( the fact they still after all this still haven't upgraded their servers is a valid critism).
---
 They have no excuse for not upgrading the servers after seeing all the issues running the cheapest servers they can (Amazon cloud servers is what they use) because they don't want to spend the money to upgrade them. Even though if they did upgrade them it would immensely help server stability, lag, and bugs. Instead they choose to continue to just go the cheapest route they can all because of greed.
---
If the game is doing as well as Todd Howard claims then upgrading the servers would be a drop in the bucket of revenue and would actually increase revenue because more people would buy things in the atom shop. As it is now most people are so close to the weight limit they can't buy things on the atom shop because they just don't have the space.
---
I swear I remember the team talking about us being able to build our CAMPS right beside each other to do just that. 
---
That sure didn’t happen.
---
Does it have better stats, than the old one?
---
Also, while the army fatigues are an outfit the brotherhood fatigues are underarmor. It would be nice to have an option to show armor over outfits. I didn't like it in FO4 but I appreciate it's a personal preferance thing.
---
Have you used the scoped hunting rifle?
---
Use the water pump, if you drink from it first to get the tap flowing, you can spam collect like you can at water sources for as long as thr water animation is playing!
---
It would have to be purely cosmetic so you don't have to balance it.
---
Since the announcement of the game i hope for a purely cosmetic way to look like a ghoul. 
---
I roleplay one but he looks just like a real ugly old human. Even a ghoul mask like in fallout 3 would help.
---
Bethesda if you want me to break my piggy bank, that is the way ;-)
---
Toxic uncivil post
---
Easiest way in my experience is to equip robotics expert and just hack the shit out of the mobs. Have to kill barely a handful of enemies everytime I want to launch one now. :)
---
Uh how about more than 24 players on maps 100 times as large as this games with the ability to have zero restrictions on what you build, or how many items you have in your inventory.
---
Deleted old post to post the same thing? You're only going to get the same answers
---
And your post isn't?
---
Makeshift ronin helm.
---
N-Nani?! Weeb shit?!
---
I haven't been able to find a picture of it yet... But the gladiator and centurion helms look great. So now I'm gonna have to majorly grind xp this weekend.
---
That will be the most likely scenerio, I have a faith in having a believable retcon at the very least, may not be the best, but God I hope those PA's aren't locked behind the "Reach Overseer X" system dotted all around Vault 51, or if they do that, please not the "Reach overseer rank 105". God I love NW, but if I pointed a gun at the sea and pulled the trigger, I would miss.
---
"One of your Camps could not be placed" every single time
---
What you want to avoid people with high kills and pick on people with low kill counts ?  What reasoning do you have that would make it logical he does as of right now if it was implemented you're not going to see a low-level player and avoid them.
---
So what would be the point in seeing there kill count ?
---
Same way Hellfire skin is...
---
Yeah, probably because the game is rendering things that we don't even see. That place should be optimized with dynamic rendering distance. We all hope for Wastelanders :D
---
\+1 Strength, +2 Perception
---
I gotta wonder if maybe it's some of the dupers coming back and trying some of thier old dupe methods that crash the servers. Now that there is a fresh crop of players, some of them might be tempted to come back to peddle wares.
---
accidentally hit my friends door
---
Think 100 is the cap for beta, so some of the stuff can't be accessed til full version is released to prevent the unavoidable hack exploiters from just hitting 200 and streaming all the info for easy views.
---
Yes please give me another reason to be wanted, the dreaded brahmin slayer
---
Let’s team up!
---
Espacially for all the newcomers that run in my camp. I want to craft something for them which takes some time and sometimes they just run away.
---
I would love to keep cooked food somehow longer fresh since it makes no point trying to sell it if it spoils in 10 minutes
---
I dont infrequently get ~1k overseer xp in a game, so 50xp is nothing
---
You don't have to shoot anything. You can just stealth your way around the command centre respawning all the launch bots. Takes way more time though.
---
Yes! My dream of making a food truck pavilion where other vault dwellers can partake in is on the horizon!
---
Just you.
---
There is a huge difference in the way that rendering and world item tracking works in minecraft, plus world objects have real physics, shadows, and more.complex structure than minecraft so it isnt about the quality of servers but the engine and code itself. You just proved you dont know what you are talking about.
---
Make it so that your secondary camp doesn't stay between relogs, just gets the parts/building stored.
---
If it makes you feel any better,  I've been getting this error for the past week every time I quit to the main menu and its messing with my ability to team up.  I've got 300 or so hours in.  
---
I'm on PC.
---
You have to watch it until somebody becomes the overseer...     until the matches completely done it's not completed right
---
Got a R7 2700x with a rtx2080 and the game is butter smooth .. exept for whitesprings but thats a problem for everyone.
---
The all rise weighs 90% less and swings faster it's damage with perks is 456, my 3* normal sledge, super sledge and grognaks axe are all at 383. Also the all rise is simple and quick to get and a guaranteed drop.
---
Did you just call your wife a cow?
---
Ewww all the click clacking of the keyboard
---
Level 150 and also news to me!
---
If I didn't love this game, I wouldn't be on reddit trying to make it better. I don't understand why members can't see that countless posts are because people want to play this game for years but realize it can be improved. Thank you for your intelligent and thoughtful post. You seem like a valuable member of this community. I wish the toxic members would be voted down so they would be more tactful.
---
Lets start over. If you want to start a discussion regarding lack of camp size and inability to put in all the atomic shop stuff, sure. I can understand that. And I can’t disagree... I can’t put everything that I’ve purchased in mine either. 
---
Given that you first edited, then deleted your post I’m going to assume that you were getting downvoted. That’s the power of the community too. 
---
 Offering feedback on your original post, you didn’t come across as someone looking for a discussion. Perhaps if you reworded a post along the lines of ‘I’d like a bigger camp so I can put more of the amazing things I’ve bought in it,’ it would facilitate one.
---
Yeah a toggle option to choose what you want the item to be. Hopefully we’ll get something like that soon, if ever. Enough people just have to ask for it to happen
---
YES
---
Yes, it really needs a pick this up , go here, enemy there, ping system.
---
100% agreed
---
I know. My strength was around 15. I was only referring to modifiers in my post.
---
Xbox: Ultimate Hood !
---
Whitesprings golf course is AWFUL, with or without camps. I get 30 fps... with a fucking 2080 Ti and a 9700K @ 1440p/ultra settings. As soon as I get out of that area? Back to near or at my framerate cap (144fps).
---
I want a "it just works" emote with Todds face. Also "sixteen times the details". I'd use it every time I see bugs.
---
Incorrect, items have real physics shadows and more as well in minecraft it dropped on the ground. There are literal machines people make that sort thousands of items a second using water to move the entities around.
---
Seems you are the one that don't know what you are talking about if you didn't realize dropped items on minecraft have gravity effects, can be moved by water, pistons, etc. Which isn't something that is able to be done in fo76, when you drop items they are unable to have the world interact with them, they just become a paper bag.
---
Stop being antisocial and get a mic.  You don't need text chat you can simply talk and chat, I don't want a whole server chat because I'll have random messages popping up all the time of people saying stupid s*** to each other, they want to chat they can simply message each other. 
---
an in-game chat would be a waste of memory on the server that is already leggy as hell cuz it has too much stuff to load.
---
You should just take the boycott part out and say that you want the budgets increased so that you can use all the cool new stuff being added to the Atom shop. You will definitly have more people agree with you.
---
I've found taking photos of stuff once its dead is the best way to get the camera to recognise what you're trying to photograph. It flags up in the top right corner. If it doesnt flag, it doesnt count.
---
You're gonna fit right in amigo :)
---
Least we had an entry with Braun *maybe* calling it X-02
---
I jumped back in around two weeks ago. I played at launch and got to around level 50. I’d recommend making a new character because it allows you to experience everything again. The stash limit has been doubled now but durability is the same. And sorry about your loss man.
---
Weapons Info and special loadout, First Person would also be nice.
---
I've found a great solution to this by simply never purchasing anything from the Atomic Shop.
---
They dont have real physics. They fall and can be moved by water. They connot be moved by any other force including player interactions, explosions, carries ect. Not only that if you drop over a certain number of items or leave them for like 5 minutes they will disappear which isnt a thing in fallout.
---
Kinda think life works that way too though. Haha.
---
Doesn't really matter if you kill 20 people in the first 5 min if you're dead. 
---
The battle is to determine the best fit for overseer not who's the most blood thirsty. If you've ever read anything about pretty much the vast majority of overseers are pretty calculating and tactful, so survival is more important skillset. 
---
A few notable exceptions being  Overseer of 76,  Gruthar in vault 13 (though he'd probably win most kills too if necessary)  and maybe Gwen and Amata but neither were the original Overseers.
---
Oh, great! Thanks for the reply.
---
So are u :) but I’m not a bitch so I won’t report
---
No. It's going to impact the servers, which is something we do not need more of.
---
Yeah, this thing is pretty alright.
---
Incorrect again, pistons can move them, explosions can move them, etc. You really don't know what you are talking about. There are item "cannons" that use explosions to move entities. You just keep proving how little you actually know about minecraft.
---
Hey, i would like to buy one if you have any.
---
I did 5 rounds. Killed nobody. 3 rounds, dead under 2 min.
---
Found armor only once.
---
Stuck with team mates, figuring that was my best chance. 
---
I went back to adventure mode. Died immediately there. I think the problem is btw chair and controller.
---
Thanks I must have missed it because I've been there.
---
Great! Where’s the picture??
---
I kinda wouldn’t be surprised lol
---
My votes were at a net zero, but we can't change the titles, and I didn't see discussion becoming productive.
---
At least two members viewed me as calling for a boycott, when I am really not.
---
There is an automatic boycott when players can't buy anything because they can't use the items.
---
I just wanted to raise awareness of that. I want to buy more things but I won't be able to use them.
---
If other players have the same problem, maybe someone at Bethesda will raise the issue in a meeting.
---
1st you are right on the 1st thing. I forgot about pistons. 2nd. Explosion destroy items and those commons dont work the way you think they do. Regardless we are off base. Minecraft is much simpler and has much less to track. Also again its about the code not the servers.
---
Don't forget that some people spend an insane amount of time playing games.
---
Switch "occasionally" to "always" and your XP will increase faster :-)
---
Also there's the "Inspirational" perk that can increase XP gain up to 15% if playing in a team
---
I'm glad someone else posted this. Seems people forget about just adding a water pump besides the purifier.
---
you are a chad
---
I want it so I can see the calibre of my team mates. There are some people who have relatively high Overseer levels, but turn out to be pretty poor players, and others who are relative newcomers who turn out to be really good. If I get the 'follow me' from someone with a high kill-score but a relatively low Overseer-score, I'll have more confidence in their decisions that than of a low-kill, but relatively high-scoring Overseer. And if I happen to have most kills in a team, then I'll be more inclined to take the lead myself.
---
Luck is always going to be a factor, but I think a kill score would be the best way to judge overall competence.
---
Explosions only destroy entites if the explosive isn't in water, if it is in water it absolutely will move the item entities without destroying them.
---
I wish there was a smaller billboard, say half the size or even quarter the size of the new one.  
---
We can leave messages for other players who come visit.
---
There shouldn't be any issues with that :)
---
Oh my God. You are still missing the point... or maybe you arent and you just dont have a valid response.
---
Yep. 40% dmg increase is just ridicolous
---

---
 &gt; There shouldn't be any issues with that :)
---
I didn't say or call for a boycott. I'm saying that people like me won't buy things they can't use.
---
You thought it was assault rifle?  
---
It was me! ~~Dio~~  Sledgehammer!
---
I think what they were saying was that Adventure special stats don’t affect gameplay in NW. 
---
If you have 15 str, you won’t do more melee dmg than someone that has 3 str
---
15 endurance won’t let you run further than someone with only 2 endurance
---
Wow man, you got it bad lol
---
Like Ripply with her flamethrower at the  end of the Aliens movie was must first thought
---
You can use them. You could have a whole building furnished and all and use every single atom shop item if you really wanted. You would just have to budget properly.
---
Sadly, the toxic members are the majority and people who can actually step back and look critically at what people are saying without getting emotionally tied up into the game and think anyone who has a criticism of the game is attacking them personally when a lot of the time people are just wanting the game to be better because they love the game and can see a place where it is lacking and could be better.
---
Please tell me that you are joking? They've hacked the game mode already? I'm on PC and this shit (cheating/hacking) needs to be stopped A.S.A.P. This kind of BS ruined Dark Souls/Dark Souls 2 for me :(
---
That's not how it works anymore
---
That would work too, but I was thinking that the Overseer level would indicate time played pretty well. If you had someone with seven kills with an Overseer level of two, then I'd rate that person over someone with three kills and an Overseer level of twenty, say (sadly I seem to be falling in the latter category).
---
Thanks, I guess it is somehow connected to Bethesda account login, and we can only wait for them to do something about it.
---
Nah read above, the OP says the Skin is called Hellfire.
---
I was accused of calling for a boycott when I was trying to speak in general terms. Titles can't be changed, so I posted in first person to avoid misinterpretation.
---
Okay then, shall be using these to begin with then thank you.
---
Yeah i've currently got ammosmith on the swap out section to only use when i'm crafting ammo, i've got adrenaline taking up all 5 points of AGI at the moment on the build, so could reduce that.
---
Yeah I was thinking that with class freak, but might remove some mutations, as can imagine Marsupial and Speed demon might get a bit annoying with their negative effects, or is the -4 INT not really to much to worry about?
---
I didn't realise you could share perk cards, sound very handy.
---
I have made a few changes on the build based on what you have said, thank you again. Unsure whether to remove the mutations because can imagine the +50% drain on hunger and thirst could get annoying first.
---

---
When I solo the event, I only choose dry wood and leave the wet ones alone.  With this method the end battle is over seconds after the first wave begins.  When players throw in wet logs, it just prolongs everything making it very difficult.   I can care less of the crappy low level legendary.
---
I'm confused. Are these things usable in the regular game too?
---
I've been role-playing as a deathclaw wielding witch and would love more freaky, creepy stuff for me and my CAMP. I've done the candles, taxidermy and skulls to death!
---
*Wonderful* should be in italic.
---
That's not fun for me. That sounds like real life and work. I don't know if other games where you but things with real money that you can't use.
---
You started off by responding to what I said making incorrect claims about how minecraft and the minecraft servers work. I've ran multiple mincraft servers I know exactly how they work. I also help on skyrim together mod so I also know how the servers work on fo76. FO76 servers have ZERO to do with rendering the ingame world. That is 100% clientside, the ONLY thing the servers do that could be even close to "rendering" the world is keeping track of the x,y,z positions of placed items. 
---
So, every point you've tried to make has been with an incorrect understanding on how the back end architecture of this game and minecraft works. So I can't really make a point about things that aren't true, all I can do is point out that every point you've attempted to make is incorrect, because they are.
---
Another big day for you?  You wake up that early to troll 5 year olds and perfect your base?  Good luck making trades from your perfect base, you must be so proud of youreself.
---
I honestly have no clue, never have I crashed as much as some people say they do. 
---
One factor currently is the free trial, a lot of new players means the servers are less stable.
---
Ah, ok cool.
---
I don't play much anymore since my friends have pretty much given up on the game but I still try to get on every now and then. If I ever pass by your C.A.M.P I'll give it a wave for your grandfather. 
---
I recently lost my mother early this year, so I get where you're coming from. Let me know if you ever need anything.
---
Well you are an insightful person and I hope you will continue to post to help balance the discussions.
---
Yeah, you can easily google "hackers in fo76" on youtube and watch videos people have been taking of people flying through the air or going underground and 1 shotting entire teams that can't even be seen.
---
If you're using an external device such as a mix amp or preamp try setting the audio buffer rate to around 4-5ms
---
I have this exact issue on PC as well from the last week.
---
If the buffer rate is set too low it causes problems
---
I'm just trying help you with your posting man. You arent going to get any upvotes with this.
---
So, rather than an immediate down vote, let's discuss.
---
WHY do you think players need this? 
---
I get it would be fun, and from what it sounds like they're doing shared workshop "towns" but not owned by each individual player. 
---
I don't think 90% of current players are going to do anything with the extra space but throw up even more unnecessary wood walls. Many don't even bother much with the CAMP budget they have right now and just have traveling craft benches.
---
Now I know I love settlement building, hell, I loved it enough I started modding fo4 and released settlements stretching the entire map because I love doing absurdly large cities... But that fits with the lore of trying to rebuild civilization, not with you being one of a few scarce survivors exploring after vault opens. 
---
I think we need some definite adjustments to current CAMP budgets to allow for more decorative space. (I preferred the triangle count method from 4 that set static decorative items incredibly low) but I just don't think most players would do anything meaningful with mega sized CAMPS other than kill the servers or take up absurd amount of viable land.
---
Actually, it is Bethesda that might wish to evaluate server costs vs potential ATOM shop sales. They are the ones losing out.
---
I still find I criminal that 12 downs gives less XP than 20 kills but regardless, nice job.
---
Yes.  Thats what I found out last night online.
---
It's like I'm talking to the chicken from Moana or something....
---
I try my best. Sometimes it feels like I'm just pissing into the wind though, this is one of the most toxic subs I've ever been in and I've spent time in political subreddits. :(
---
Maybe we can put trap meat in with the good so if the fridge does get raided the wanted criminal will get a nice poisonous surprise when they are munching away on your hard earned food supply
---
Thanks for the constructive criticism. It's always refreshing.
---
updated post with image link
---
I have, and the damage is nothing to scoff at, but the recoil is all over the place, so it's much easier to follow up with the Scoped Lever Rifle. To me, there's really no comparing.
---
even an apocalypse can't stop you guys getting a full English
---
I noticed this too and meant to post it. Thanks for posting about it.
---
I see your point, I just think to get people to agree you should word it differently.
---
Thanks :D
---
That really isn't a valid response to what I said. You literally are incorrect about how the servers work and you think you understand how they work but you don't. 
---
The way minecraft servers handle players, entities, tracking the world, etc. ALL mimic fo76's back end quite a bit. So you thinking that "oh they are totally not the same" is completely incorrect. 
---
Look, I write code for a living, and I run numerous servers for my friends and as a side hustle, so I understand very well how servers work. It is very obvious that you don't.
---
They level capped beta to 100 so the exploit cheaters couldn't just hit 200 in the week and start streaming all the high level spoilers.
---
The easiest way to do this one and make sure that you get it is to do the event in Morgantown. The one where you have to wipe out the waves of scorched at the airport so the Cargobob can come land. It's invincible when it comes in to land and when it hits its lowest point as long as your clothes and take a picture it works. I've had to do it a couple of times for different challenges.
---
This post is absurd. Not only is it incredibly easy to keep the fire lit, but the people who “don’t help” on the roof usually are the ones that can sway a loss to a win by taking care of mobs as they spawn. RNG has very little to do with having enough firewood since you should get around 12  on the task that requires you to first gather firewood. If you can’t keep the fire lit, you’re doing it wrong.
---
The only time I have failed the event is when either it glitches and no one can add firewood, or too many corpses are on over the prompt. And the more people you have running for wood the more that gets wasted since two people can add kindling at the same time and you only get credit for one persons.
---
If you’re having trouble doing the event solo there is a very easy solution. Get a Tesla Rifle. Even a standard Tesla will destroy practically anything in just a few shots. Otherwise, it’s on you to get through it, but there is no reason to berate other players for “not helping”.
---
well yes. but actually no.
---
It's in the game, but not obtainable. The only way to get it is on PC from people who exploited the game to get into the Dev room which housed it. All these people got flagged and banned, so don't try it. The Combat marine helmet still lingers around, but if your on PC I advise not to. I don't think there's any consequences if you, that's a grey area to me, but just for saftey, avoid it until it gets an official release.
---
2. There's level scaling somewhat, it doesn't scale to your exact level but instead it's intervals.
---
3. If you don't want to level upp efficiently, just enjoy the game.
---
4. everywhere off the road on the ground you can loot wood from logs
---
The answer to this is doing the quest at the airport. The one that sends 5 waves of scorched at you? It ends in a cargo bot dropping a box like 10 feet from the ground. Easy close up pic.
---
My God. I can't sit here and explain to you how wrong you are ALL day.
---
You are right, you can't because I'm not wrong.
---
I'm glad you shared this. Not on Xbox so I can't come by, but I think I know which pond you mean and I'm going to remember this story every time I see it. I didn't know him but I believe your grandfather would have like this.
---
Ok kiddo. Have a good day and enjoy minecraft.
---
pretty sure it’s a skin for the T-45 (called inferno I guess)
---
Fortnite is an established game, nuclear winter is in beta. Have some patience
---
I'm one of those hard core Fallout fans that wanted nothing to do with this game, so I'm a bit biased towards my opinion of the game. 
---
That said, it's fine. From what I've played of the free week, I can't really call it good, but I can't call it bad either. I think one of the biggest issues for me was that I had no idea what to expect from the game. I used to play Ark and I was just expecting a shittier version of that (If that's even possible). It does a lot of things that these survival games don't do, and I can really appreciate that. 
---
I played the Xbox and PC version, mainly out of curiosity. The Xbox was laggy as hell, but I presume that was primarily because of an influx of new people. PC for whatever reason was much smoother and didn't crash as much. 
---
I'm definitely sold on picking up the game at some point. Maybe during this free week sale, maybe if it goes down in price again, because it certainly is NOT a game I would pay full price for. I think the $20 price tag is fine. Once the Wastelander Expansion comes out I could see myself enjoying the game much more, if at least to make the world feel a bit more alive. 
---
If I do decide to get it however, how is PC vs the Xbox community? I primarily play games alone, hell I got to the highest world tier by myself in Division 2, but I can see this game being much more fun with a more social aspect.
---
4. Pricket fort, ne side of the map. There is a giant pile of wood that you can harvest. Yield near 350+ Wood with woodchucker perk card on the lck tree
---
There are 5 main zones in the game. It goes from starter zone (the Forest) to endgame (Cranberry Bog).
---
To level up my second character I just killed ghouls on the Whitespring golf club... but doing quests and events isn't too slow either.
---
You can get wood from fallen trees and locations with piles of wood (many cabins, for example). Also from workshops that have a wood node.
---
I can craft it. I got two from someone and scrapping it gave me the ability to craft it. They sell rather well in the vendor.
---
Funny indeed. Innit?
---
Enjoy being ignorant of how actual server architecture runs while ignoring someone who literally has a masters in CS that literally runs servers all day long.
---
You are like arguing with an antivaxxer, ignores actual trained professionals trying to explain to you that no vaccines cannot cause autism as autism is a genetic disorder. But you believe you know better because you read this one paragraph on a random blog somewhere.
---
Thanks for the welcome.
---
Tonight's session will be my last free one. The trial and dropped price most probably have pulled me over the edge.
---
Lmao. I'm literally a system administrator. Bye
---
You had to read about someone’s grandfather passing away, but with poor spacing?  How hard it must be for you, losing something as important as an indent...
---
Ever Upwards &amp; Purveyor - Wild Appalachia at its finest.
---
I see NW is a great success but after having spent more time yesterday with it - its going to be a pass for me on the most part.  NW is still BR and the BR format just isn't appealing to me.
---
Didn’t think I would see Chernobyl and Epic in the same sentence but here we are I guess
---
that's not really a complaint on the game, if the community behind it is still growing. 4 minutes is also not long for a game session. have some patience
---
The only reason I can think of is that purified water lacks minerals, which would perhaps be needed to make a healthy soup. However, we are trying to survive, not optimize our diet, so...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Yeah I was thinking that with class freak, but might remove some mutations, as can imagine Marsupial and Speed demon might get a bit annoying with their negative effects, or is the -4 INT not really to much to worry about?
---
I've found that with green thumb and butcher's bounty, food is so plentiful that I don't much have to worry about the extra hunger that comes from having speed demon on, and I always have a pair of water purifiers running in the front of my CAMP, which I get purified water from regularly enough that thirst isn't much of an issue either. Intelligence only really impacts the rate at which you get XP, which gets to be less of an issue the higher-level you are. In general terms, I find that taking a mild hit to XP gain is less of an issue than wasting three perk card slots on something like class freak. 
---
  
---
&gt;I didn't realise you could share perk cards, sound very handy.
---
Let me tell you, if you're in a group of four and everyone is sharing a level 3 perk card with the group, the effects can be astounding. Especially cards like Bodyguard which give bigger effects depending on how many people are in the group. The way it works is this: If you have at least 3 charisma, you can share a level 1 card. If you have 2, you can share a level 2 card, etc etc. So a character with 15 charisma could share a level 5 card. Since most cards don't go higher than 3, most players don't bother to go higher than 9. 
---
This is looking like a much more balanced build, and I think it'll serve you pretty well. It's also worth noting that as you level up, it's sometimes worthwhile to have two different versions of the same card. For instance, I have a level 5 makeshift warrior card for when I'm crafting and modifying melee weapons, but I also have a level 2 version of the same card which I use when I'm out beating people up with sledgehammers because while I do want *some* additional durability, there's better uses for those other three perk card slots, and I don't honestly mind having to repair my weapons once every two hours rather than once every four hours, you know?
---
Can you redact instead of removing a post fully?  Not sure if that's even an option since I've never moderated, but it might be a less heavy handed approach than removing it completely.
---
They aren't going to lose atom shop sales, as long as they keep churning out cool stuff people will keep buying. Power armor paints are flavor of the week anyway, idk anyone that would set up 5 of the same power armor just to use different paints.
---
You're just forcing something to whine about, the last stash increase was disclaimed as being the absolute max, so increases won't happen.
---
Its already hard enough as it is loading up huge atom shop camps, making a bigger budget would be a total shit show.
---
My response to this is the same as I suggested a long time ago. Make all “outfits” under armour, then in the paint option of armour allow us to make it invisible. Then you could have as much. Or as little showing as you want and it’d make everything fully customisable
---
Sure, if that were the case you would have known that fo76's servers do not render the game world. The fact you think it does shows how little you actually know. That wouldn't even make sense for them to render the game world on the server as that would be an INSANE waste of bandwith and processing power that every other online game offloads to the client.
---
You demonstrated clear as day for anyone with any sort of experience working on the back end of servers.
---
my game just kept crashing last night with a playstation error code. haven’t tried it today yet. it never made it past the sign in page. it worked fine two days ago.
---
But why doesn't register eventually like when everything loads when you relog. Its been stuck for three plus days
---
I hang around low level areas too. No big deal with that. I like helping newbies.
---
How would you say it?
---
Oh right, hmm. I don't think thats a player with any invisible effects, since it would still have a distorted shape of it around it so it's not 100% invisible. It's either a bug with the stealth mechanic graphic, a mis-matched entity or a

You can see the argument that everyone is putting forward by reading through this thread. There is a lot of players in fallout that have very little interest in CAMP building, a floating 1 foundation build with 4 walls and all the basics in it is all they want. A few turrets and decorations maybe thrown in for good measure lol. 
---
That's probably what the CAMP system was tailored towards. 
---
But then theres a lot of people like me who loves building complicated atmospheric builds with lots of lighting, complicated structures where possible and tons of decorations while also keeping the builds looking structurally viable ( not floating ). Maybe even roleplaying with there builds I.e forts , shops, hotels etc.
---
So for a player who is not into CAMPS as much the budget is more than enough. For players that are classed as builders in a game the budget is no way near enough.
---
So where do we go ? Does Bethesda try to sort there many CAMP issues out, increase budget, make building easier, add tons of new CAMP items and structures. This could have server issues. And would mainly appeal to the builder type.
---
Or 
---
Keep it how it is and probably loose a shit load of money from the atom shop. Because theres very little reason to buy alot of stuff mainly because you struggle trying to use it in your camp. And for some people CAMP building is very much an endgame thing. They build and build, and it adds to the longevity of the game. And makes the game world a very interesting place to explore. 
---
I'm a builder I want more stuff, bigger area to build and more budget. More choice and an easier placement system because its shit currently. But I honestly feel that CAMPS are not on bethesdas high priority list if at all to be honest. I'd be very surprised if anything changed regarding camps for a very long time. 
---
Theres surely a compromise, a small budget increase but a massive improvement on the CAMPS structure variety and how easy you can build one.
---
Foundations should have a triangle version for round builds that your not glitching. 
---
Triangle roof sections and a better choice in roof types, like tiled, wood etc. 
---
Floors should connect to foundations, not just to stairs which is stupid.
---
Walls and floors and so on should also be allowed to clip into terrain, even if it's only by a small amount.
---
More support parts should be added. For more realistic looking builds. And again they should be able to clip into the terrain. 
---
Theres tons more that needs changing but atleast these kind of additions would make for way more variety and more impressive looking builds without having to raise budget hardly. 
---
It just needs to work and offer variety in what we can build to keep a builder happy :) 
---
Sorry this is so long, I got a bit carried away guys.
---
How I said in my 1st comment
---
Sometimes convenience is worth way more than a few caps.  Hence, this post.
---
It's an intelligence perk that you can start acquiring at level 9
---
Playstation went down yesterday while I was on the game. And it's just been buggy since
---
The point is that I can't keep five sets of power armor so I can't buy five skins. Accusing people of whining is not helpful
---
Considering a good chunk of the dev team is Star Wars Galaxies alumni, and we've already got player housing &amp; player vending somewhat similar to SWG, I would love to see that games player owned town system, or something like it!
---
1. There's a lot of parallels to fallout 4. 
---
2. There is, sort of. The area around flatwood doesn't scale beyond 12ish. Each area of the map has a minimum level and maximum level that it scales to based on your level
---
3. Do events and that'll help you level. Other then that, explore and kill enemies. If you come across higher level jobs and there are higher level players, tag the enemies by doing damage to them and you'll get xp when the other players kill them.
---
4. Wood is found everywhere, look for logs on the ground.
---
5. A lot of the hate was due to a rocky start and various YouTubers who never actually played the game perpetating the views of a vocal group.
---
Best I can reason is early game purified water is hard to come by. So they were probably too lazy to code the recipes to work with both (or be able to set which one you prefeered) And instead of posts complaining about not being able to use purified water it would be, "why does cooking soup use my purified water? Now I have to take them out of my inventory everytime I cook pls fix bethesda!"
---
Player vending is quite key for this if you don't wanna hunt endlessly
---
Most shop owners have slight Lee way with pricings too
---
Nice
---
Maybe one to one one damage to players = one ex point
---
My xbox x have Hard crashed 2 times since the patch, never happend before, also more cashes, but mostly the days after the patch.
---
What ability
---
In things like brewing, it can make a taste difference.  NON-Purified water IRL can likewise mess up some delicate chemical reactions.  But when it comes to just plain ol’ cooking, not so much.
---
Gives it a more earthy taste
---
We ALL float..... down here...
---
Rng is rng.
---
Problem is the price. Why would I spend a few hundred caps on maybe 100 bullets when I can buy 5x that from a player for cheaper?
---
I’ve seen a few posts about it arriving. Got my e-mail and it’s supposed to be here next week, can’t wait tbh.
---
Beware of building as well, I got stuck under one of my blue prints and had no way of removing it or freeing myself
---
Agree! I have not been able to get the play an instrument at Nukeshine to work despite playing all of the instruments 5 or more times each. The cargobot photo is too particular, a friend said if you can catch it over the horizon the photo will register. I think the cargobot just needs to be near your height. I have not been able to capture the cargobot either. The deathclaw hides do appear in boxes or blood bags occasionally, but are so rare, it is impossible to complete the leatherworker. I did the tadpole cooking challenge - double check that you don't already have the brain bombs recipe. I thought I was short a recipe and it turned out I had it somehow. But Antonie will have it, you just need to server hop a little to get it.
---
Fallout 3 was the first game I played in the series. Went to far too fast and got slaughtered. This game is consistent with that. 
---
You can fast travel for FREE to vault 76 and your camp. Taking a little jog from the vault to the overseer's camp, you'll find lots everywhere. You can search them all once for wood, then a timer starts. After a while (30 mins? An hour? ) you can harvest from that one log again. If that one trip doesn't get you enough wood, just hop back to 76 and choose a different direction.
---
But I never said boycott.
---
make sure you're set to fullscreen in display settings.  i had this problem until i did that.  i was as surprised considering my PC specs.
---
As my Gran says:
---
“Expectation is premeditated resentment.”
---
Try blowing their legs off, it completely immobilizes them, carry mines with you, afaik normal ballistic damage resistance affects melee resistance
---
I’m just amazed at how varied the RNG is. You can get legendaries that drop nothing one time, and get non legendaries that drop 3* another time. Starts to make me wonder what the point of legendary enemies is.
---
your carry weight limit + 1500, i think
---
I smell... \*sniff sniff\* electricity!
---
Ok man. Have a good one.
---
+30 to carry weight
---
Sorry for your loss brother. I play on Xbox I will definitely be taking a trip over to your place :)
---
Yeah, its like that, sometimes its 9+ sometimes its a wooden leg and a drill
---
Fortnite at launch didn’t have an 8 min lobby system or push lore on people that weren’t interested in it.  Fortnite’s br mode was an after thought just like fo76.
---
INB4 Bethesda makes jumpsuit non-removable. (which would force you to buy cosmetics to get a better camo)
---
I'll just give it to you for free PC ign Jirohen I'll be OK right now if you'd want one.
---
Umm, I have 12 sets of power armor in my stash as we speak, I have multiples of a few sets. So, yes, you can keep 5 sets. My stash is loaded to the gills and I damn near always have the junk I need to craft, except for big sessions like ammo which I stock up on.
---
If you go back to the last stash update patch notes it stated absolute max. 800lbs is fine, it's plenty to work with and the game runs good with it.
---
You just don't know how to manage your stuff, if you have overflow of something make a mule, if you don't want to make a mule, get rid of it.
---
Definitely looks like good material on the bag I seen some people on launch day saying the material on theirs was shit but it looks good!
---
You probably just have too many lights, you can place 50 lights and each of them takes 1% of camp budget. Foundations also take up a ton, sometimes you can find ways to remove foundations after placing them to save budget and just cutting down on the amount of turrets and using cardboard vault boys or scarecrows and your own guns is serviceable if you wanna push it.
---
Also medic either include the item in game or change it
---
Are you wearing PA? It depends.
---
This is correct.
---
Thank you! My ign is darkrakso
---
Some of the requests are getting ridiculous, this being one of them. In a single player version of fo76, yes, have 20 camps/workshops. Not online though. This would again put the servers under even more strain, which impacts other people's gameplay.
---
Currently a good way to level up is to play Nuclear winter
---
The original was a crappy plastic-style bag. Colour was off , fabric was a cheap failure.
---
I would assume so, the patch notes said rewards can be used in adventure/survival mode
---
Blocker perk maxed.  
---
If you are team playing, share rad sponge and have ghoulish.  Those slaps heal.
---
+10 CHA
---
There is a small lake a short walk south east from top of the world that has a pretty large Brahmin spawn.  Much easier to milk there than flatwoods.
---
Its is if you llockpick it
---
It carries over?
---
Make a mule as in buy another copy of the game, or run multiple instances?
---
Yep :)
---
Your lvl doesn't mean much. I'm lvl 180 and still take heavy damage from the ghouls outside of power armor.
---
Perks like blocker help alot with this.
---
That's my usual method, but i don't have a weapon that can reliably do that while being mobbed.
---
Nope. I like to sneak.
---
Okay then, thank you so so much for all your very helpful advice!!
---
**...but not because of the bounty.**
---
I read "hit my friends door", not "picked my friends lock". You're correct tho.
---
Im sure the youtube talking heads will all take not of this and mention it in their next videos...
---
 /S
---
Yeah I can't believe how little this has been used.
---
One of the first things I did was build a defensive tower in adventure mode, then blueprint it so I can pop it down for my team wherever we run into trouble out in the open
---
You can have 5 characters per account, make another character and transfer stuff to it, you can do the same with caps.
---
Good luck and enjoy!
---
Last-hit killcounts are bullshit and we all know it.
---
Thank you again!
---
Yeah I heard Bethesda got alot of shit for it but I'm glad they delivered and made up for it
---
Camp budget does not increase.
---
This is usually what I do to harvest aluminum and junk. However you have to some times be careful, if a high level player has the workshop at the power plant they are liable to come and steal your workshop for the food generator. Had that happen to me more than a few times.
---
What if he meant to say I hit my screwdriver and bobby pin into my friend's lock. Then turned them and got wanted. ;)
---
Nope, graphical glitch that places the fire wall from nuclear winter over top a regular nuke, it doesn't affect anything.
---
Gotta lay off the Jet man
---
PRINCE! The frog's name is Prince!
---
increase your DR
---
Happy to be of assistance!
---
My guess: they don't want people to be able to farm specific guns for some reason. Easier to manage drop balance by just randomizing over a loot table than giving people any indication what they might get by doing something I guess. Or they want to keep all enemy types equally viable by not weighting drops based on wieldable weapons. Personally not a fan, but you'll get used to it.
---
Welcome to WV.  Best advice I can offer is don't rush.  Theres lots of stuff to see and do, and lots of places to find.  Don't worry, Levels will come.
---
Just like Fo4, there's lots of visual jokes, cultural references, etc.  Move fast, miss them.
---
there are at least 12 Power armor spawn points in the Forest alone.  Most of them will have at least one fusion core.  There's a couple different area that can have up to 5.
---
If you went to the SW side, you were in the Ash Heap, which is better suited for L30ish.
---
Stay in the forest/green area until about L15, then go north to the Toxic Valley.  At 25ish, work your way down the left side of the middle of the map (savage divide).
---
At 30, go to the Ash heap.  at 40+, you can go anywhere on the map.
---
follow the overseers quest.  It will keep you (more or less) in level appropriate areas, as well as teach you the lore behind FO76.  Roses quest starts easy, but will quickly take you to places you are not ready for.  Te mysteries quest is the same.
---
The middle of the map (savage divide) and parts of the Ash heap scale enemies depending on who else is around.  If you go to places like top of the world, palace of the wind, or lewiston, and the enemies are L30/40, a high level has been around, and they have scaled up.  Come back later, they should drop back down to L6-10.
---
The Mire (top right) and cranberry bog (lower right) are always high level.
---
WS is usually high level, especially if it has been nuked recently.
---
There's lots of wood in the Toxic Valley.  Pencils, clipboards, wooden blocks all scrap to wood.
---
so do the boards supermutants carry.
---
At least something for an assist, that way it's definitely more of a sense of teamwork if you all get something for bringing someone down.
---
How can you transfer inventory between characters without running multiple instances (on PC)?  
---
People have been requesting this capability here but people don't support the suggestion.
---
Had a guy on the roof screaming into the mic “THE FIRE, ADD KINDLING TO THE FIRE!!”. 
---
Meanwhile he is sitting completely still killing level 8 bugs. I ended up screaming back at him “PUT YOUR OWN GOD DAMN KINDLING ON THE FIRE THEN ASSHOLE” but I don’t play with my mic plugged in lol.
---
I think se should have a Camp, that we can deploy anywhere, for those times we need desesperatly to cook or fix something. And a house, the main base and where we can sell stuff and all of that.
---
10Xp per every 50 damage seems fine
---
Agreed no for now. Work on what we got, improve let the community grow anther year. Than maybe drop some new game modes next years E3.
---
Yes please.
---
The lobby is to explore and even has holotapes and rank accessable areas. You also can reorder your perk cards and unlock new ones etc.
---
The wait in the game is for everyone to load in at their marked spawn point. If they didn't wait for everyone to load in, it would be whoever has best ping/hardware and they would have an advantage over the late comers. If it spawned you on a plane like pubg etc then the loading in game time would be less.
---
And when i'm leveling if I can't get a perk card I need then just pick a random one really?
---
I'm curious for more details on these outcast paint sets.
---
Oh really? I thought it would have been something you are told from the start not something you'd find out later.
---
It’s funny this came up because someone started some shit with me last night and he was running a Tesla, I killed him 12-15 times and he got me once lol, he just wouldn’t give up
---
Honestly....this would be pretty cool. An even bigger nuke zone would mean more enemies AND more resource gathering aswell 🤯
---
We can't edit users' posts. If we could I'd make all of you look ridiculous.
---
But seriously though. I personally have no problem right now with users editing the names out of the post and then asking for it to get reapproved, but currently our policy is a suspension for violating rule 9.
---
I remember PUBG had the same issue too when it came out, did not reward XP for damage, and who did the finishing shot got the kill. 
---
I'm still of the mindset that, placement XP should always be "king". Both position, and time alive because after all its about survival.
---
Honestly it was the exact opposite of what i expected it to be. I thought it was gonna be regular adventure mode but the entire map was nuked and all the enemys were scaled really high but wow.
---
“A surprise to be sure but a welcome one.”
---
You find a friend to help you.  You don’t even have to give them the stuff if you don’t trust them. You just need them to stay in the world, drop your stuff in a world container, rejoin, and pick it up again
---
Well, I have builder a big base just exactly the way I like it, perfectly done with all the walls and everything, 2 bad i have very little camp budged left for decoration. ;(
---
Then he worded it wrong lol, that makes me giggle tho
---
Any % Reduction Will always be more powerful than defense ratings
---
Spoiler: canvas bag.
---
Ehhhhh legendaries or not if you suck you suck lol now people that complain about vats can see its actually there skill that sucks 😂😂
---
No worries - yeah I thought that might be the case.  Either way keep up the good work - its tough moderating subs, I've done BBs in the past and don't miss the responsibility.
---
Just like the other guy said, stuff like trash cans, desks, have unlimited capacity, so you just drop off what you want to transfer there, swap and load back in and grab it.
---
There is always a variable though, game could crash, so if doing high end stuff I highly recommend having a friend hold on to it. I have never had any issues with transferring, but I don't change it with high end stuff.
---
...this conversation is done. It isn't wrong. You aren't thieving. You are being ridiculous.
---
Neato
---
Option to enchance nukes confirmed?
---
But that is the beauty of br’s sir lol
---
Yes we had ammo scrapping in 3 and nv why not in 4 and 76
---
No fucking way.
---
Piling on the bandwagon here, but I do agree. An 'assists' stat would be great. 
---
Playing the other day I managed to get 3 other people nearly down as they fired from cover. They downed me but my team was able to go around while I had them distracted and take them out. I did most of the damage but got no exp or kill count.
---
thank you
---
Well stimpal diffuser is in the game. It's just a stupidly rare drop from the new Arktos event
---
What did it cost?
---
Everything
---
Well, not necessarily. You can always forego picking a card when you level up, and save that card selection for later, when you're at a high enough level to take it. I have a character who's like level 240 and I have about five cards I could choose to take any time I want to because I haven't bothered to pick one the last five times I leveled up, for instance. 
---
But in practical terms, there's always going to be something useful you can take.
---
Dude I'd love to stop by sometime and pay my respects, just let me know when and where.
---
Unfortunately my friends play on consoles while I'm on PC. I wish there was crossplay because we could all team up.
---
I'll agree with the premise. 
---
Want to add more stuff from the Atom shop, but can't because CAMP budget is full.
---
Ergo, if camp budget was increased, Atom shop sales of camp items would likely increase as well...
---
Which platform?
---
You are playing it for free after its been out for over 8 months.. really asking this?
---
Fortnite is solely a BR game. Nuclear winter is a new game mode that is being tested
---
I think and this is never confirmed that caps would go in like quarters after grubby smashed. Still doesn't make sense on how many to put in but that's my head canon
---
Yup, you’re “that guy”.
---
You can ask on here. People do not all the time
---
yeah my other friend (the one complaining) is using the trial, iv never crashed playin this game  tho
---
pc
---
Gotta look into bloodied or AA explosive. TSE was nerfed I have a TSE Lever that still works well for me tho.
---
I am so glad that the outcast paint was a reward and not an Atom store item
---
I don't have a big or fancy CAMP. It's modeled after my apartment with similar lighting and decor. I just can't add stuff that I wish I could.
---
The ability to change out account names?
---
I don't mean a perk or anything just the display name that comes up on the map. I don't really take part in the social aspect of the ps4 and rather solo it now in game i have no issue with others needing help or wanting me to team up but having my account name up isn't ideal.
---
Time and a what you do with that time is all it is.   I do go out of my way to kill mobs in my normal daily circuits and always have my rested and cranberry relish exp buffs.    That's what I like to do so the levels add up fast.   Others are more sociable or don't have the time so the levels are more infrequent.    It is definitely somewhat slower to level now then it was right after launch.   Exp was lowered on quite a few things and it did seem like it needed to be, leveling was very very fast.
---
Damn Battle Royale is fun!
---
The BoS have been flying around Appalachia fighting the SBs in them though...
---
False. Winners should get a nuclear winter cape
---
Cause bitches love winners, and bitches love capes
---
Your first win should give you an exclusive item, weapon, armor, whatever. Just something to show off your victory. I also think a win should give you, at the very least, a perk card... or three. Having another way to get cards would help with all the people getting duplicates. I've had many duplicates myself and I'm starting to get concerned that my build isn't gonna be up to par with my enemies if it continues.
---
Since nuclear winter update which I'm not happy about, if I wanted to play battle royal I would of both the stupid game,  I stopped playing other games for adding this game mode in it.   I really thought I was safe in fallout.. To make it worse it's opened the floodgates for Modders/ dupers what ever... 
---
Since the beta of fallout I've begged people to give the game a chance,  I defended it from the get go,  despite me and hubby getting ripped off with a nylon bag and only just finding out their was a claim form that no one could find,   but to find it had a deadline which has passed.. 
---
The reality if before pusuading people the server crashes were due to dupers and Modders and pusuading people to ignore streamers for false information I got alot of people to give it ago.. 
---
Then nuclear winter happened.. Yes I choose not to play this mode.. But that's not the problem,   the problem is,   after Bethesda worked hard to ban and kill off the Modders and dupers,   it's just opened the floodgates for a whole new batch,   
---
I remember one indication was frequent server crashes.   This morning 7 in 2 hours and ground hog day,   being put back several steps in game play.  Is really getting to much.   
---
The other day a lever 180 was killed one shot by a level 40 in adventure mode not in pvp or workshop.. 
---
Things have taken a turn for the worst.. Bethesda needs to pull their fingers out to ban these new spawn of cheaters, loyal players are clining by a thread in hope Bethesda starts listening,  two steps forward and a giant leap back.
---
I thought I had lost mine as well after the Nuclear Winter update (on Xbox), but I had to go back to the atom shop and turn it on (not sure why it turned off it the first place).  Had to check there a couple of times because the icon for it didn't look like what I thought it should look like, and I glossed over it.  Make sure any emote that is marked (Owned) is checked.  Good luck and hope this helps.
---
Yes.. This so much.
---
that doesnt really help when you are trying to ping the paper bag with armor and guns for your teammates
---
'They took too long  it's too late the game is dead &gt;:(' -Youtuber, 2019
---
If I exit a server, I can never enter the same server. Any item dropped or left in a container is lost forever without a team to rejoin.
---
I wish there was an option to choose to return to the same server, because server kicks are awful.
---
Well... atleast the enemy had to cut out you from the trap first.
---
might be the ps servers at fault. you dont connect directly to 76.
---
my son would go ballistic, blaming our isp and router, till told of how many servers along the way he's actually dealing with.
---
mine can be dicky at times also, hope you get it resolved.

"Guys there is an enemy at 233 with scout armor and a pistol"
---
That's what I meant to express. Thank you.
---
Actually they just realized I couldn't move and threw 3 grenades at my feet
---
Ah okay then, so if I level up to level 5 for example without putting any points / cards in, can I then picked 4 level 5 cards? sorry if this sounds really noobie
---
Yeah, it's a weird mechanic. If I kill the last member of a four man team, my teammates should get their credit for the other three enemies they downed. It's a little more situational than it sounds, but it does happen a lot later in matches.
---
I understand where you're coming from on this. Going to share this thread with the devs. Thank you mate.

Yep my bag arrived this morning!

Ouch...

lol, yeah, that was a new one :)
---
Can easily launch a nuke while riding the nuka world monorail from fallout 4
---
Honestly, it's working so smoothly and has been so warmly embraced by the community, it's bizarre that they would want to shut it down at all. Hopefully it'll be brief.
---
I usually apologies by going the "???" Emote followed abruptly by the puke emote. As if to say "I dunno what happened, I'm drunk."
---
Could you maybe point out the errors, instead of insulting the person? Not even just for my benefit, but for the benefit of the countless dozens of people who might read what I wrote and erroneously (according to you) assume it has merit?
---
That sounds like a You problem, everyone else complains about storage space being too small. Most of my 800lbs is junk, it's all I really sell in my camp. Junk is plentiful.
---
Don't we also read about scammers that steal then laugh about it with no consequences? 
---
The point is, the existence of mules provides strong evidence of a problem with game inventory.
---
Spoiler : it was a rushed job
---
Are you sure that you don't get anything for winning? After my first win I had some stuff for CAMP construction become unlocked that I didn't have before.
---
The word you are looking for that structure is a gazebo.
---
The Fortnite BR mode was added to Fortnite: Save the World. It just ended up blowing up.
---
I'm on PS4, its definitely way better than launch! I played it in November and honestly hated it, but E3 gave me some hope, especially since they're going to add NPCs. Had a blast so far during the trial, and I'm going to go today to buy the game for good! I'm a massive fan of Fallout in general, so I'm so happy to have a new one to play lol. I've only experienced one bug this week in playing, and otherwise I really haven't had any issues.
---
I got it pretty easily, just server hopped in flat woods til I found a good gurl/boah who gave it up.  Survival has been deserted the last few days w/ everyone doing NW.  More than once I was top 3-5 just joining
---
Too many possible issues could be causing it. StRt with the last updates notes for PC.
---
Well, it's a little odd: The "outcasts" in Fallout 3 were honestly just traditional BoS soldiers who didn't want to go along with the local chapter's abandonment of their organization's normal principles, right? In light of which, it seems to me that the paint jobs they wore could easily be seen as being an existing part of BoS tradition which Lyons and his crew weren't making use of for whatever reason.
---
Yes, also survivor mode is 20%+ xp
---
I have to agree. Either a crossbow or a decent scoped weapon to swap to has kept me alive a lot longer in games. Crossbow/SMG is probably my favorite setup to switch between.
---
I believe there's stash crates and an overseers chair plus statues and stuff unlockable from leveling up but as for a direct win I don't think so!
---
Obviously not a major flaw but it'd be cool to have some kind of winner coin, or atoms to be used in the shop
---
If they vend anything it should be junk or candy.  Grab a pocket watch, jangles the moon monkey and some cotton candy bites for the kid.
---
As mentioned, you don’t need to give the person your items. You can put them in a container. All you need is someone to stay in the world so you can rejoin. 
---
Honest feedback. At this point you are coming across as someone looking to complain. A lot of people have been giving you suggestions and you keep responding with ‘yeah but’. I feel like you have a need to be right. You’ve gotten a lot of grief today, maybe just take a step back?
---
Damn I post something like this but worded differently and get game works fine for me.
---
My only complaint is that the bolt action animation generally allows people to dip before I can get a clean second shot off.
---
Make it like mobs, you help kill and you all get xp, or if you kill them yourself you get more.
---
Oh I see. It must have just been that I coincidentally levelled up at that point and misattributed it to winning the match. I agree with you though, there should be rewards for winning. Even legendary script would be a good reward.
---
Blocker and Adamantium skeleton helped me a lot with these creepers
---
We can all agree though, Combat sniper rifle is pretty much trash. I am partial to the scoped lever action my self. 170 damage with a headshot sends people reeling :)
---
Really well that explains things
---
Especially since the "PvP" finger guns feel way more sassy than actually threatening. I usually to that+thumbs up if I think ur stylin'.
---
Cooking. I kid you not, you'll get a lot of early levels that way. Building camp stuff, too.

---
Idk where to ask but how do you increase your S.P.E.C.I.A.L in NW
---
What’s rng
---
Nah, just use a fixed slot on the wheel for berry mentats/stealthboys.
---
Whenever I get shot at from up close before I can see where the enemy is, I do a frogleg jump and use a stealthboy before I reach the maximum jump height. 10/10 survivability. Same would work with berry mentats.
---
On ps4 this means: Press triangle, D-pad UP, left stick RIGHT, press X.
---
Yes! I would love to display my Vault Tec coffee cups on my coffee table please! I also want to display tools on my workbenches to make them look upgraded! Please this needs to happen! There isnt enough variety to personalize our camps. I know we get things from the atom shop but all these little junk items would make the game feel so much more homey.
---
This is coming from someone who probably uses TSE with marsupial...
---
each special has  a total of 15. you cant max them all because thats set to 50.
---
some cards will only appear after your level matches the requirments for that card.
---
3rd party google is the only way to plan in advance.
---
specials stop at 50, after which,you may choose a card or swap 1 special to another.
---
clear as mud, but you will gwt the hang of it soon.
---
Just gather and craft aye?
---
&gt; Either a crossbow or a decent scoped weapon to swap 
---
My boi!!! This is my combo too!
---
This is just a sneak peek; the full version most likely isn't finished. 
---
Hence why we only have the one map in the Forest to play in, and I assume there'll be a short PvE questline in Adventure/Survival that has more details on Vault 51 and what's going on. They're probably also going to make adjustments based on the data and feedback they're collecting.
---
This has been posted like 10000 times.
---
No.
---
Purified water is harder to come by than boiled water.  It's used for crafting chems.  I don't want to use up my purified water on corn soup, I need it for chems.
---
The only way this works is if chems could use boiled water, and I doubt they'd do that.
---
Max for any special is 15.
---
Certain cards do not show up until certain levels.
---
You get 1 point each time you level up.  Point can be placed anywhere.  You stop getting points at L50.
---
After 50, each time you level up, you can either pick a new card, or move a point from one category to another.
---
When you get the option to level up/pick a perk (pip boy/level up), press the level up button, then instead of picking a card/category, press the back button.  That should let you look at you current specials and the cards available.  decide where you want the point.  Back out, go back in, and select accordingly.
---
Ditch Lock &amp; Load and Bullet Shield - never a reason to waste perk points on those 2.  Blocker is a great defensive perk in the long run as a lot of things will just try to melee you and rush you in game.  Traveling Pharmacy is a great weight perk to have as well.
---
I recommend having 3 points in Endurance so you can max out Fireproof.  You'll want it for power armor, basically makes all the Scorchedbeast screams do nothing.
---
Lone Wanderer and 4 points in Charisma is all you need.  Swap in Tenderizer/Suppressor for big fights, Travel Agent and Hard Bargain when you go to vendors.  Unless you always intend to play in a team in which case you can do more with a bit more Charisma.
---
You don't need to run Gunsmith 5 all the time...  and you certainly don't need Intelligence at 14.  Make sure you get all the repair bonus perks maxed out so you can repair weapons/armor/power armor to 200%, swap those perks in as needed.  There's no reason to have Science/Expert/Master at 2, all it does is for non legendary weapons.
---
Adrenaline 5 is a luxury too - I suggest like the other person to mix in max Thru Hiker and use Adrenaline 1 for most situations.
---
I'd take at least 3 points from Intelligence and put it into Perception...  this way you can mix and match in rank 1 Commando perks and 3 levels of lock picking for general use (or 2 lock picking and 1 green thumb) and only swap in Glow Sight for lock picking when you're headed into a nuke zone.  Allows you to use an auto laser rifle and/or auto tesla as your sidearm...  there's really no point to using heavy guns 24/7.
---
Grinding the camp daily? What do u mean?
---
IMO bloodied build is bae. I only get in power armor if I absolutely have to go in a nuke zone. The benefits of unyielding gear are astounding.
---
Agreed more of a challenge and not so on sided.
---
Well yeah it's random lol. The non legendary thing is a glitch though.
---
What? when I post about crashes and disconnects I get game works fine for me comments.
---
Sneak better! 
---
Seriously though, if you haven’t already, get the marsupial mutation and lure the mob out while you jump to a high/safe spot and there you can pick them off. 
---
Additionally, I would invest in a shotgun just to cap their legs at a quick pace. 
---
I have a stealth, sniper build but I carry a furious sword that swings 40% faster and cuts through the ghouls like cheese. Just spam that strike button and they fall fast.
---
Genuine question or sarcasm?
---
No, no. Each card has to be leveled up. So if you want level 5 gunsmith, you need to pick level 1 gunsmith, then pick it again and again, choosing to increase its rank each time until you get it to rank 5. 
---
It's also possible to pick gunsmith a second time and not choose to apply it to the existing card. So for instance, if you had gunsmith 4, and you picked gunsmith again, you could add it to the existing card and bump it up to gunsmith 5, or else you could just keep gunsmith 4 and also have a gunsmith 1 card. And if you wanted to, you could even combine the cards later on into gunsmith 5 if you chose to.
---
Yes, once you unlock them from playing Nuclear Winter they're just like anything you could buy at the Atom Shop. I'm still a piddly rank but I can craft myself a vault 51 jumpsuit, or one of the small NW crates as a stash box. (and just like Atom Shop items, you can't trade them with other players)
---
Right, but I mean he probably got one day of cheating until this account gets banned. Seems like a lot of trouble for little payout for them, and an inordinate amount of frustration for others. Fuck these kinds of people
---
I would like to be able to sit down with a cheater and just talk. Why would you cheat? What do you get out of this? And the most important question: "Do you really think this will make your parents proud of you, and no longer regret not getting an abortion?"
---
Sigh, so many questions.
---
I believe the combat knife only has two mods that can be purchased at most railway vendors for cheap - recommend doing that if you don’t have the perk card.
---
You really need to get Enforcer in the Agility tree. I regularly cripple every ghoul at WS, then wander off and let other people finish them.
---
I run an Anti-Armour combat shotty with rank 3 of expert, master, and rank 2 of shotgunner
---
This would be an awesome addition, the outer circle could be a blast radius where any camp in the range of it is partiality damaged and thee are some rads (10 or so) and maybe a rad storm to let players know they are near a blast zone but not yet in the main part of it. As the nuke zones are high level having this circle could be a place for medium level players to pick off the spoils of war
---
Yeah tell me about it. I had 4 non legendaries in a row that were stuck in the laying down glitch, all 4 of them have me a legendary weapon.
---
If THAT glitch can bug out the RNG, I wonder what else can bug it?
---
Could be having issues tracking everybody's location, stats, inventory, stash, camps and everything else, the game engine was designed for single player after all.
---
I have random game freezes on PS4 entering buildings or fast traveling, I launched my first nuke the other day, fast traveled to the nuke site and boom my PS4 locks up on the loading screen for 5 minutes forcing me to close the game.
---
I mean I highly doubt that its an online game man you kinda knew what you were getting yourself into when you bought this
---
Aye. If you farm Radstags and Super Mutants near the Overseer's camp, too, you'll get a nice loop going.
---
Yeah, I would hope and expect to. I imagine that in the fullness of time, there will be battlegrounds around Watoga, Harper's Ferry, and other points of interest which would make for interesting places to run around and shoot each other.
---
It's a low level 1-star.  Hardly anything to get worked up about, the real reward is the event loot and chance at a Possum badge (which you'll get as long as you're in the event).
---
I've won games with the scoped combat rifle. You can knock teams of people before they know whats happening because of its fast fire rate, just takes 1 headshot and body shot a person and boom, win. The exception is if they're in marine or power armor, then its just 2 headshots, which is also pretty easy to accomplish due to the small recoil and quick fire rate.
---
The fertilizer thing (dont remeber what its called) takes up as much budget as the turrets used to.
---
No, thank you. You are doing god’s work
---
Complaints yield improvements. If you feel the game cannot be improved, then why participant in this forum?
---
Cleaning toxic goo at the kiddie corner cabins is also pretty quick and relaxed
---
Were said slidey bois diseased by any chance? That's usually the mix up, which BGS claim to have fixed.
---
I'll be searching for it wastelander.
---
Spoiler: complainers gon complain.
---
Running enforcer at the moment, what type of shotgun are you using? I've got a double barrel at the moment
---
Lol I don't even own one why you making assumptions that ain't nice😂
---
Then you're not setting up properly. If you can barely see someone and won't be able to see them if they move, then don't shoot at them with the hunting rifle. Alternatively if you have a couple scoped weapons you can tag em in the head with the hunting rifle and quick switch to another scoped weapon and finish the job.
---
Lol. I have a bad habit of replying to old posts. Will be more diligent next time.
---
Thanks for the update though!
---
Yeah, I thought having PA would make me like a tank. I get downed so quick. I feel better with just Scout or Marine armor.
---
True. That's an option... Although you've got two problems. First that means splitting the code base further, which risks introducing further bugs. Secondly, you could run into issues with lower end PCs.   
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see it too. If they optimised the engine I'd love to see it happen... But that'll be the first time they've optimised anything, so I'm not holding my breath. Perhaps they'll find a sneaky tech workaround
---
I was thinking 1 to 10 xp per damage dealt to players seems reasonable and intuitive
---
Hehe slidey bois.
---
Yeah they were. I’ve gotten legendaries from diseased before. But getting 4 in a row seemed a bit fishy.

Thats why i crawl in the bushes until there only 1 team left. You get much more exp for just surviving than killing. I just want the skins!
---
That’s a terrible spot for a fort...lol 
---
Why not build on the cliff you’re standing on? It’ll be unlikely but the entire point of a fort is being defensible from all sides and you left yourself vulnerable from above...
---
Yes you can, join a friend, or find a name of someone on that server, and rejoin them.
---
Idk how it works on pc but in Xbox I find someone,search their gamer tag and make sure "join game" is available, then I leave, and join them back in the same server.
---
Its much more reliable with a friend in the world.
---
Supermutant have lots of XP, and there's lots of them in several places in the forest.
---
I'm a melee build also, but you will eventually are going to want/need a couple rifle perks.
---
Early in the game, I found a sniper rifle...and the cliff across from grafton steel and WV lumber are good places to test your marksmanship skill.
---
Other than than, do events in the forest area.  scrap and craft.
---
I just lost a game where it was down to 2 and the circle was too small for even a stealth boy to be hiding.. I died to the storm because there was no storm free land available
---
Workshops are quick and easy to gain for +200 xp and then a minute later Defend for another +200xp. Free aid items, junk and plans when you complete the quest. I never build them, just take them for the plans and xp and leave.
---
My camp is so small compared to others and I'm nearly at 100%. I do have a lot of small items as decoration but I swear it feels like eveyone has more than me so an increase would be amazing.
---
dear bethesda
---
Oh my gods yes. And that would make sense that it's using Pre-War money since it's setup with nice shiny pre-war tech rather than our cobbled together vendors.
---
You could even make a newer Nuka-Cola vending machine that only appears at stations that takes Pre-War money (can't pry it open like the old ones that still appear in places around the map)

4 times in 2 hours, I gave up

Damnit, the helmets I want are NW, I hate doing PvP
---
The only problem with a bloodied build is the difficulty obtaining top tier gear - bloodied weapons and unyielding armor go for astronomical prices, and that's even if you can get someone to actually sell them to you.  Usually trade only, or find your own.
---
No regrets building my 2nd for it though, finally have enough nice gear on him but it took a while.
---
Do I need to make them into a word somehow? To launch the nuke?
---
It's all somehow based on server. RNG on one is terrible, another has 52 legendaries all lined up and smiling. It is weird how it usually feels weighted though.
---
About as difficult as searching for the same exact question being posted 20 times a day! 
---
Lol, seriously though...it’s like riding a bike, you’re gonna be fine.
---
Go play fortnite, fallout isnt for kids.
---
Ha did you take that idea from dead by daylight? Just curious, I know there are many places this could come from but dead by daylight is the one I know of from the birds.
---
And I think if you want that done it needs to be more than 30 seconds and that's probs why u got so many dislikes
---
Last night I was fighting the Queen with only 3 other players (one was \~ lvl 20), because there isn't much high leveled players on the servers right now. The fight with the queen and adds took so much ammo (.50) that it must be my new record..
---
As a reward for all this I was sooo thrilled to receive a Drill from the Queen.
---
I love you
---
Can you also pass along that getting my kill stolen by a thirsty teammate who finishes the downed enemy should give me the credit for downing them?
---
Adding NPCs sounds like giving in after they said many times they would not do it. But hey, I’m not complaining.
---
Ok so the backpack adds 90dr plus you may need better armor. Im sitting at about 400 dr and can take out a few at a time even a hoard with the right weapon. Also if mele, martial artist is key because you can hit them before they hit you. I think the barbarian perk will help as well. Certain armor mods also reduce stagger.
---
Honest question, how's the quality? Is it light and decorative or could you use it for gym duty?
---
Melee will become more useful. In survival I remember the hardest teams to beat where the teams using ranged and melee weapons. While 2 people were shooting, 2 others were rushing it was super effective. Melee isn't useless it just isn't being used right.
---
This is an awesome idea!
---
Thanks everyone. Will try and test all of these methods
---
I'm 89... glad I know now, lmao
---

Patience is really at an end in society.

no, just enter the numbers in the launch computer as shown

This hasn't just been discussed before, it's been discussed and requested heavily.
---
Wasn’t this also one of the houses the human NPCs settle in from the trailer?
---
Yes vault raids are coming with wastelanders in the fall
---
And ruin the surprise?
---
I use a combat shotgun with the increased reload speed and armour pen.
---
If you on xbox i can craft you one as i know all the combat shotgun mods
---
I completely agree, I use an automatic rifle build so I'm in the same boat. We not only need to be able to break down ammo, I think we should also be able to package it and sell it as boxes. There really isn't a lot of ammo that is actually worth 1 cap each, we honestly need boxes of ammo so the prices can adjust to what players actually find them to be worth.
---
It is. It's also like watching Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles have a gun fight.
---
Ah okay then thank you, but I meant can I pick 4 cards that I unlock at level 5 if I waited?, sorry for all the questions
---
Confirmed bug that happens when you join into the adventure mode after playing nuclear winter.
---
Essentially, I could log in and out after completing a workshop and repeat?
---
Food recipes?
---
They know what they're doing. No matter when it is released after this they will do fine.
---
I think the team based deathmatch mode is the Nuclear Winter Battle Royale thing going on this week. 51-52 players all fighting to the death. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️

No more stupid than you?
---
I did the same lol , they probably got a ton of new people after e3.
---
This is correct and confirmed by one of the Bethesda people in another thread with this question. They're gonna d
---
Your game looks way more vibrant than mine, can I ask what settings you're using, or do you have digital vibrance or something on high?
---
It did seem like they were back pedaling a bit, at least it's in a way that makes sense for the story though. I agree with you but I'm not complaining either lol
---
Posted about this yesterday. Lots of people reported similar problems. I’ve deleted a lot and can’t even place the new chair or replace anything I’ve since scrapped. Someone mentioned they had to move their camp and rebuild to get their budget corrected. I personally can’t do that so I’m stuck not being able to build anything at all until Bethesda addresses this
---
Isn't what?
---
Thanks for the offer, I'm on PC though unfortunately :(
---
I will light a mofo up for messing with my moo moo.
---
Lol dam y'all got all salty cause I spoke the truth 😂😂
---
In my opinion mics can be much worse than a simple ping. Just like in your example here it's vague and you have to try slap together the information and find your bearings. Where as a ping is like right there and there's no mistake about it.
---
How's the quality? Light and decorative or gym bag quality?
---
Also, if you don’t want to blueprint your existing camp, you can always go to a workshop, build whatever you want, blueprint it there, and take it into NW. I’ve been building mazes with hidden rooms to hide in
---
I have a sickness, I see ammo, I pick it up. I always run around with an exact metric shit ton of useless ammo on me at all times. I usually drop around 60lbs of ammo when I finally come to terms with the fact I need to get rid of it, being able to scrap it would be amazing.
---
Let me start by pointing you out that incredible build planner nukesanddragons. There you can see the perks, mutations and even what your stat increases. Also if you want quick kills, go full-auto on Vats critical build, if you make it bloodied, it will be appropriate glass cannon, that will make you feel like a god. However you can die a lot on tougher enemies.
---
For your questions, I am willing to answer, but while I am on work, it will be hard. So, I'll just do it later.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, vault dweller!
---
My apologies as my statement appears to be half right, but alas half wrong for the fact that while the item will not get you banned or receive punishment you cannot in fact get the plans as a reward.
---
I mean survival mode beta is still just sitting over there lol
---
Have it where sometimes the only place I can respawn is the other side of the map costing me a nice healthy 44 caps my broke ass would rather spend on bullets. This is also a pain as it’s another 44 caps back to pick up my stash of dropped broken desk fans, teddy bears and battered clipboards.
---
Very light , and feels quite durable
---
I can't help but think that gunfight would be amazing to listen to.
---
U can change ur hair any time tho
---
They aren’t giving the game away free because of ‘bad reviews’ that’s just a load of shite that websites like to say.
---
There’s currently a free trial for like a week to entice more people to buy the game but the game isn’t free, it’s just a trial
---
Side note, there was a post made a couple days ago about a guy picking up just a casing, which hopefully I dictates that scrapping down ammo is on the horizon.
---
Yeah. I would actually oay for some of those *winkwink* as I really hate BR gaming...
---
This is a no brainer, and a must. We NEED this desperately, think of the possibilities 😛
---
Are you overencombered? I’ve had that happen to me. But i was like +100 weight at the time
---
Power Armor display stands please.
---
EVERY camp gets attacked by mobs no matter where u build. the game spawns em in....it just depends on WHERE u build how strong those mobs are.
---
Best advice i can give is go to areas that have loads of mole miners. (Blackwater mine, the ash heap,etc)
---
Grab all the combat shottys they have, scrap them until you get the mods you need.
---
Maybe even hop round some vendors and see if you can find any legendary shottys
---
It was explained in the patch notes, mode description etc lol. I think it's not getting used because people are more interested in playing that mode than messing about in adventure at the moment. That will probably change when it's fully released.
---
as im new to battle royale games, what exactly does a ping do? does it mark things ont he map for your teammates to see? or does this "ping" also reveal positions of enemies?
---
Very cool... this is a clever new way to get an indoor garden. I didn't realize the plants would clip through everything. I'm the guy who came up with the [rooftop garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ar31ca/my_rooftop_garden_how_to_place_crops_indoors/) btw, I was really sad when they patched it :-(
---
I think you're right, it's close to 76.
---
I'd rather have faction vs. faction large-scale PvP than battle royale, not sure if the game is ready for 40v40, but sometime like 24v24 Settlers vs. Raiders, hopefully its objective based too so not just a plain old death match.
---
NW is nicely done but its still a BR and I just can't get into running around for a bit trying to survive, its mostly a survival death match.  I need some objectives and coop for PvP to be really interesting.
---
That’s exactly what a BGS shill would say...
---
Free trial 10-17th. Not giving it away and not because bad reviews.  Give it a try! Only 3 days left it’s really a fun game.
---
Can easily launch a nuke while Preston Garvey marks a settlement on my map.
---
Same issue here
---
You clearly dont understand what salty means ... if I was salty i would insult you and not just tell you to bogger off.
---
Because imminent death where you can't even get to your power armour is a real fun surprise.
---
You win you’re right
---
Absolutely. It costs about 25 caps to take, but that 25 caps gets you two guaranteed plans, +500 xp and some random stims and junk. Not a bad trade-off. The junkyard in the forest is close to 76, and there's another close by workshop to the southeast of the Mothman exhibit. Take two, defend them both, get +1000 xp and 4 plans. Log off and repeat. You can even sell the junk/stims to recoup the caps. Although you get caps for clearing workshops anyway.
---
Because you’d be lying
---
There's a free trial going on until the 17th.
---
As far as the group quest issue, what you experience is normally. The first reward your brother got was for helping a teammate complete their quest. Each individual has to complete a quest for themselves, but all teammates get a little bonus for helping out.
---
I feel ya. I got the luck of shotguns while everyone else on my team got autos. Every fight was me pounding them with a shotty, while my team scored the kills.
---
They should list assists too if your damage helped finish them.
---
Bang! Bang!..
---
"Hello"
---
Bang bang bang...
---
"Is it me you're looking for?"
---
Honestly? They started hearing that complaint in June last year, but according to that developer interview they didn't start working on npcs until launch.
---
I think it's taken them this long to get them to work,especially with the instancing.
---
Yessssssss! This would be absolutely amazing!
---
Lol. I feel like people have been conditioned to oppose what others say 50% of the time, whether the subject helps or hurts them, politically or with regard to their enjoyment of a game.
---
People don't realize that being united forces charge.
---
I do feel the toxic responses even with innocuous posts.
---
The paint skins should work for all types of paper armour, then they would be much more useful and rewarding
---
You can favorite things and they will go into your favorite bar. Which is easy to access. Depending on if you're on PC or console. (I didn't see before commenting.) I only know the buttons on PlayStation. Look up "Favorite bar on fallout 76" in Google it'll tell you.
---
I'm playing the free trial. = D
---
but I want to know if those rumors are real since I'm poor
---
I leveled my alt character from 5-25 that way, without leaving the forest over a weekend. No one messes with low players anyway, especially not in the forest.
---
That's Lionel Ritchie.
---
You know that's not the point. I don't care about being right; I want the game to continue to improve.
---
Go to destiny and practice in the crucible?
---
It's mainly because all the servers are heavily populated now. If Amazon can allow Bethesda to have more servers the stability would be far better then it is now maybe even better. But I haven't experienced anything game breaking at all on Xbox. It's pretty smooth, my frame-rate hasn't dramatically dropped in over 3 months, only time I have lag issues is if I use the Xbox home menu then go back in game, only happens for a second or two though. Been playing since the stress test so basically since early October last year. Do I think the launch was a mess?: Definitely but nowhere as bad as New Vegas' launch, first few months was literally impossible to play. But just like New Vegas I believe Fallout 76 is definitely VERY stable, moreso then how Fallout 4 is that's for sure. I have way more game crashes on Fallout 4 then I do with 76 and that says a lot about how stable this game truly is.
---
Honestly its great mine has some raised stitching others ive seen on reddit are alot better and i will be using it as my daily carry from now on .
---
I've hit top 5 twice by getting stick in random parts of the map like an idiot, but hey. Top 5!
---
Tesla is a looters best friend - tagtagtagtagtagtag...
---
Especially in events like campfire tales or imposter
---
Spoiler : not complaining
---
Did they happen to contact you before they shipped it out? I put in my support ticket the day after they asked for our details, but I only got one update since then.
---
I'm glad to hear. I didn't expect they'd use ship canvas but hoped they would try and make a solid bag after the rumpus that was last year
---
I'll try to remember when I get home.  If you get to a PS4 before me just add me 'bradatar' same as on here.
---
If you still need help in a few hours, I can do it. I need to do the same thing myself actually. If someone else gets to you first, no worries. I use the same name in the game, feel free to friend me if you want.
---
yea. PER GAME. A match lasts 15-20 minutes, if you stay alive until the end. Thats 4 minutes of lets say 22 minutes of total gameplay including loading in. Thats 18% of your time (reminder: if you last 'til the end!) just waiting, when it could be easily cut down to 1-2 minutes. 
---
I understand people want to explore V51. But even that part will be done by most people at some point. Same with re-arranging perks. Majority of players who hit the Nuclear-Winter Button just want to play the pvp mode.
---
Exploring should be moved to Adventure/Survival. So people can take their time, since you might want to spend like half an hour in there and not even play the BR. Thats fine for everyone.
---
Re-Arranging perks should be moved to either the main menu or to a different tab on your pip-boy (so you can even do it in Adventure - which would help with re-allocating your SPECIAL stats, too).
---
However - this is only a (really good and stable) sneak peek. I'm pretty sure they are already working on these (or similar) solutions.
---
Exactly why i wont play BR in any game......
---
Toxic community always ends up toxic....toxicicity always wins.
---
äääh.. i might be dumb, but which is the „canvas bag“ and which is the „trashbag“?
---
Really? I have a different experience, might be time zone?
---
Me and my friends couldn’t even place out camps across several servers, all of them are filled with low levels (not vending machines).
---
I’m a terrible pvp’er and I did my best placement 3rd with a scoped combat sniper rifle and hazmat suit, which may be the best camo in the game.
---
How come "Lock &amp; Load" and "Bullet Shield" aren't worth it?, and if I remove these two, and replace them with Level 3 Blocker and Level 3 Traveling Pharmacy?
---
To get the 2 extra points into Endurance, what would I take them off? I would be playing in a team the majority of the time, so the 9 Charisma would probably be good for the sharing of the level 3 cards, I could reduce it down to 6 and only have level 2 cards shareable.
---
How come not Gunsmith 5 all the time?, as doesn't this make weapons break slower? for the Science perks, would it be best to have Science 2 and Science Expert and Master 1?
---
What perks / levels can I remove to move 3 points from Intelligence?
---
The auto laser rifle or auto tesla sounds like a good idea, thank you.
---
A ping is a marker you place in the world by looking at something that only your team can see. It’s a fast and easy way to let your team know if there’s a gun they should grab, a direction they should head in, or an enemy to watch out for.
---
Did I do nukes in 10 mins, no damage taken in a hazmat. Super easy. If you have to use stealth boys then I think nukes aren't for you.
---
Id love to know the most popular ammo types.
---
So far I sell mostly shotgun.
---
My "what's around this corner!" syndrome gets me in trouble fast.
---
Gunfu
---
Most of the crafting related perks are in the Int skilltree
---
Team up with someone better and hide like a coward
---
Lol damnit it is. I'm old, I get muddled up easily.
---
Interestingly enough, I find that my camp gets attacked less in the bog than it did when when it was in the forest.  I don't even bother with turrets anymore since the mobs are so rare
---
It's something!
---
Funny you should mention that. There’s one story podcast available (fuck chad) and another one coming out soon. 
---
There’s also a radio station! Www.rbtsradio.org
---
That’s mine. And the maker of the Chad podcast is my friend. We would love to see the community expand with more creators and “augmented” lore, stories, etc. 
---
Private message me, we have Facebook and discord.
---
Avoid combat till the end if you can, let everyone else kill each other
---
This isn't going to mean the way it sounds, every time I log into a blast zone I always get alot of warning that I'm in a blast zone. On Xbox at least, the load time is so long that the signs of a zone usually load before the radiation. So there is a chance to get out before it over comes you. 
---
I do agree though, alot of people don't exit the game prepared to deal with radiation.
---
Look right after creating a character. I think the institute had it as well because it was still using the same object.
---
Stuff
---
What exactly are you asking?
---
What is wild is a new player like me thinks this is normal to only see a few people on the map :P.  Good to know it isn't since I bought it.
---
I'm happy for you. I've always felt the haters been missing out. Alot of propaganda surrounding this game.
---
Gotten your backpack yet?
---
You can try out survival or make a new character with a different build.
---
A rad storm in the area around the main blast is a great idea! :)
---
yes please
---
Got my backpack, I have two other characters, I’m a returning player that just forgot what to do lol
---
I know you can but it would be nice to be able to sit in the chair and have the bot talk to u as you scroll through the different options and then when you stand up to leave the bot again says something about the option  you made. if you have ever played world of warcraft, just something simple like that is all I was thinking. Plus hairstyle mods are always one of the first things I install in any of my fallout games and I would really like more option that the small list we currently have to pick from that is all.
---
I think the rewards should be more but you do get more XP for lasting and also team placement xp. And it is incremental to how long you last. And when you level you do get crate icons, picture frames, and so far I have an Overseers chair for my camp.   I think I am coming up to a trophy I can display. I do think we should get scrip for top 5 teams!
---
And please... give us rewards for total damage done!
---
Yes please. Thank you!
---
I actually see teammates not fire at our enemy until we brought them down and are reloading. 
---
That's annoying and counter productive. I have voice chat on again mostly to just to ask people not to do this. Of course the guy that was doing this yesterday called me a "Fuckface noob" and told me to "Git good noob" and "Only rewards for killing them nooblet".
---
Just not a great gaming session yesterday. Nothing but jerks. Being free ATM is certainly bringing in the leet crowd.
---
They were selling 3 caps apiece 
---
The best I’ve seen was someone posted on Reddit a camp they visited and the seller had like 25000 stimpaks for sale. Super Duper extraordinaire!
---
The entire xp system needs tweaked, maybe even doubled. I’ve gone pretty hard since launch and am 27, but that’s with a ton of hours. I’m fine with skins being high level locked but stuff like holotapes will never get heard when you need to be like 50+ for most of them.
---
There’s been a lot of feedback on this, and I really hope they take it to heart.
---
For one, I really, really, really like the lower-scaling on the weapons and armor. It makes the game more predictable and less one sided. The leveled gear in Adventure/Survival means they have to do funky things with balance, so NW-BR is much easier to balance.
---
Second, it isn’t quite balanced yet. Some guns are way way way way way better than others, and armor is somewhat meaningless. Wood is 72 plus whatever adds you get and PA is 100 and something. Weapons are all over the place too (though bonus, energy weapons actually useful) ... but yeah PA .. loud, noisy target. 
---
I’d love to see a few things
---
 - Balance for weapons / armor in NW. PA needs to be beastly, given it’s huge drawbacks. Single shot weapons need some love on hit boxes or something to make them more useful than the auto weapons (not sure how they are doing hip fire accuracy). Half-VATS feels weird. 
---
 - Tuning down of most relevant weapons &amp; armor (esp. legendary effects) in Adventure/Survival ... like maybe by half. Drop bolster/vanguard to 20 max, unyielding to 2, instigating to 50%, bloodied to 25%, other situational but always on (zealot) drop to 20% (keep mutants 10%, while aiming 10%, probably don’t need to touch explosive since you’re hitting the base number) etc. Bring all the damage and resistance top ends down a bit. This would make the game much more easy to balance, similar to NW. If not reducing the legendaries, I know they put a lot of work into leveled gear - but maybe reduce that to a single item. Pipe revolver is pipe revolver, level doesn’t matter. 
---
Balance is always hard for game developers when they are dealing with exponential scaling - and they have that in FO76 ... gear, situations, perks, effects and legendary effects are all multiplicative. How do you make a game balanced when the range is so large? It’s tricky and things can get pretty out of wack. Anything you can do to reduce that difference between min-max would be great. 
---
BTW, I don’t think they should adjust the PERK values, as those represent player choice. Our choices should matter more than our gear, and the more permanent the choice the less I’d be inclined to change it (don’t change PERKs and cards, think hard before changing mutations, I wouldn’t bother changing bobble heads / magazines but I’d change base / item level values and legendary effects)
---
Its still just 4 minutes.....what is acceptable....15 seconds?
---
I suggest doing sit ups or pushups between matches, you be getting exercise and healthy in no time.
---
Of returning meaning haven’t done the Wild Appalachia quests, they are fun. Plus new build objects. 
---
There is also Project Paradise.
---
gear, unless every weapon and piece of armor you own is a 3 star you haven't reached the end game.
---
I've tried that but my teammates are often useless, one teammate helped me become overseer though
---
You called mea kid that's an insult😂😂 omg
---
I keep hearing all this about project paradise, what is it?
---
Exactly what I do :)
---
YES YES YES.
---
This is one of my biggest issues ATM. Team mates outright stealing kills and not firing on an enemy while we down them. Then they just kill them and get credit.
---
Nothing to be sorry about. I'm happy to help. 
---
   
---
And yes, you could absolutely do what you suggest in that scenario.
---
I loaded facing a cliff wall and the blast zone animations didn't laid in at all, even after 10mins of play
---
In my opinion, the whole thing is a waste of time.  The big idea behind this mode is for 52 people to pounce on each other for 20 minutes.  Where exactly is fun in that?  You must really be into PvP to enjoy this.
---
Most people grind for the best arms and armor. 
---
If you're like myself and are happy with everything you own, set up a shop. Running a successful shop will keep you plenty busy. 
---
Tbh the possibilities are endless for things to do end-game.
---
PS4 here. Would love to stop by if i could. Your story gave me tingles because i was halfway reading through it when,and i will swear on a stack of bibles it's true, the radio started playing John Denver's Country Roads. Safe and happy journey through the game for you and for your granddad's spirit.
---
Take the hint and change your bahavior.
---
A BULL BARREL FOR THE REVOLVER FINALLY
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QZSsPQ9Mus9sRWZwcsdcH/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-5-notes-may-21-2019
---
I put a post out on another thread. We really really need the leveled gear and legendaries in A/S to be tuned down. They are multiplicative and make scaling issues.
---
Playing w/o VATS in BR seems weird when I come from playing my crit sniper in A/S. I kinda want to see VATS, but am hesitant as it would need to be ... much less of a crutch.
---
That said, if it could be used to make some weapons useful that’d rock.
---
I don’t think you can. I think you need to go into adventure mode, level your character, leave, go to NW
---
It's a new event up in arktos pharma, it's a pretty decent challenge so if it pops up I recommend giving it a try
---
Shotguns really benefit from VATSing and criticals. My current build is shotgun focused. Concentrated fire, Enforcer and Critical Savvy are the main perks that are pulling their weight when it comes to high level mobs
---
Just in case someone may profit from this:
---
I feel like an idiot actually, but after 200+ hours of playtime and dealing with low fps / nonfluent gameplay (didnt bother.. just pve.. ill get used to it) I changed different settings. ended up on low-medium with the usual 30-40 fps.
---
Until i finally tried Fullscreen instead of borderless windowed (tabbing out a lot. Discord / Reddit / Twitch / Browsing Pornhub etc).
---
I hate fullscreen. But well - I'm back on 200 fps at high settings now.
---
**TL;DR: Try fullscreen if you're on (borderless) windowed!**
---
to everyone: dont make this a server performance discussion. this is just pathetic! honestly the server performance is and always will be f\*\*\*ing crap. no matter how big or small the camps are...as long as there are more than 2 players moving on the map it will lag and/or having performance issues. get over it! but dont make us ppl who want to be at least a little creative on base building pay for a crappy game code. fallout 76 is far worse than FO4 or vegas...more building options and a higher budet would at least give us some fallout-feeling back....  
---
in addition they add constantly stuff to the atomic shop....but why in the hell would i buy stuff for my camp if i cant place it or have to remove smth first in order to have it placed
---
I dropped buying stuff from the atom shop due to budgets.  
---
They may want to consider Atom shop items to take up ZERO budget !! 
---
This would encourage buying those items ( until you have someone’s camp look like a hoarders house where you can’t walk )
---
What’s do great about it though?
---
Are you using stealth and rifles or stealth and something else?
---
If it's rifles or ranged weapons, are they silenced? Do you have high agility and max sneak/stealth damage perks?
---
I usually fire from an elevated position for safety (Yay Marsupial mutation!) but even on occasions when a group of ghouls pour out of the golf course, I can pretty reliably headshot every one of them in VATS without moving further than \[CAUTION\]
---
What's your build and playstyle? :)
---
Even if someone else has helped me i should still be online to help you. PM me when you go online
---
I believe so
---
Which region are you?  For example, I am in Southeastern US.
---
Similar idea like in the battlefield. Exp for assist.
---
It’s a visual bug that’s been around for a while, it happens when a plant has already been harvested and so technically it’s not there to be harvested but the graphics are not displaying correctly causing a ghost plant, the same can happen with the can chimes, if you switch server and approach the exact same plant and it’s displaying correctly that time it will be un harvestable without the flowers, grains etc
---
Go to Camp Adams when its 10:30 PM or so and it should spawn.  I've never had it spawn earlier than 10:30.  And you don't want to start it too late because if the sun comes up while you're doing it, the event is over.
---
Punishment for spot campers is me coming up on them and 2 shotting them dead.
---
Yep, I've mentioned this before. A vault boy slapping his forehead or something would be perfect. I would use this constantly
---
You can save blueprints of your camps.
---
Interestingly, I’ve found players reluctant to attack my camps if I don’t put a door in it and if don’t open any shutters. It seems that they don’t want to create noise by shooting. Therefore, as long as I can put down a blueprinted structure without anyone noticing (which isn’t always easy), it’s not too hard to get to the final 9.
---
Correct. I honestly believe adding the Settlers and Raiders was something planned day one.
---
Headshots, Evasive Perk. I use a Level 50 The Fixer commonly, but a Furious or Instigating handmade or combat rifle should do fine - just try not to pull them all.
---
The big deal is the rad damage. I tend to not run blocker all the time (I have it, but find sometimes when I put in the carry capacity cards I forget to put blocker back in after I dump the junk) - so on that character I religiously make and farm radshield.
---
Oof the man himself! I watched your tutorial and tried so hard to do what you did for that roof garden. It looked so cool! Glad you approve of my basic bitch version :D
---
I'll fully admit that while I stand by my early criticisms, all that did get to me too. I made an effort to enter the free trial with a completely clear mind and I think that helped a lot.
---
I believe its in the road map, or at least a planned feature to let you decorate your camp with static objects.
---
Someone should correct me if I’m wrong.
---
Spoiler: Anything with ink or grease. Really, really - keep anything like that away from your nice new bag! Uh, unless you want it to look appropriately 'Fallout' - in which case can I recommend filling it with stuff and dragging it across sand/gravel and then giving it a very light spray with black aerosol paint.
---
Enjoy!
---
Communication is everything!!!! So if you can get team mates that actually use their mics you will do so much better.
---
Battlefield does this really well. They have an “assist counts as kill” feature so if you do majority damage to an enemy but a teammate finishes them off.
---
Have you tried just being hot...
---
do you know how difficult it is to take you seriously or side with you on anything if you put laughing crying emojis at the end of every single post?
---
Well, I think the portion where we have to simply go find firewood without actually needing to feed the fire is meant to teach us where the kindling is and what it looks like
---
Exactly! When it was announced at E3 that it was an online live service game, there was a vocal minority that decided this game was going to be shit no matter what.
---
Bethesda tried to get ahead of it pre launch but just got overwhelmed. Just like you said, compared to many online games, the launch was solid:  you could consistently log in and the game more or less worked. (Which is a low bar, but online game launches are rough).  Throw in some missteps with the bag and Nuka Dark and it was just a mess.
---
I've unsubscribed and blocked many YouTubers, some of which I once respected and trusted, because they were so very wrong and I can't trust their analysis anymore because they'd rather chase hate clicks and rail against game modes they personally don't like.  Bellular news is the most recent, he has very misleading thumbnails and video titles because he knows 76 hate gets clicks.
---
I always like finding those crazy concrete camps in the wild. Nice look :)
---
Im the south west  uk bud
---
Private servers is something Bethesda has said they will look into in the future but it’s not on the horizon right now so as it stands no you cannot make your own server.
---
use a VR controller to aim
---
I think it was to gate the real rewards so we don’t blow through them week 0 of NW
---
You know what’s surprisingly useful? Scoped revolvers. If you have the pistol damage card, and you hide in a bush closer to your target... its not terrible.
---
If anyone has a build that utilizes single or automatic rifles that would translate well into NW. I know that you don't get the same perk cards, but the perk cards in NW do rely on the special stat allocation of your Adventure mode character.
---
gave me a good chuckle mate
---
Your power level is still at lvl 50. The extra levels is for getting the other perk cards or changing special points.
---
Yes.
---
Ending the free trial of the game should get rid of most of the cheating, at least
---
I think you might have to install the full game
---
They are not above /against removing content they aren’t happy with
---
Nope, no email. Might've been a ticket update, but I've yet to check. It just turned up through the mailbox.
---
It comes back sometime this summer
---
As much as we all want our mad skillz to lead to wins, rendering and general internet wonkiness makes it so any reasonable game does a bit of adjusting to account for that (server side, client side, etc.).
---
I got tired of server hopping since I kept getting put in the same server too, and just made a fertilizer producer at the workshop you have to capture, much easier.
---
So, now we know what happened to the dwemers: They teleported themselves out of Tamriel/Nirn and into the Fallout universe where they founded RobCo and MassFusion
---
My store is doing fantastically simply because I’m one of the only 100+ level people around whose camp is in the mire.  The only things not selling are the legendary weapons and armor.
---
NW is new so many people aren't used to it yet... Maybe it won't be full of noobs later
---
Yup, happened to me a few times
---
Thanks for the info, I'm farming for it myself and the grind has been so painful... been at it for over a week now using multiple methods and characters and friends.
---
Oh and base building wise you don’t have to have a base tbh, every workbench you could possibly ever need is available in the whitesprings shopping area so you could just use your camp as a free fast travel point if you wanted.
---
sounds like a blueprint
---
You can spawn directly into a building, so if you know where the boxes are you can get equipped pretty quickly
---
I hug a bush as long as I can and try not to piss myself when someone starts shooting...
---
You've not been lucky enough to get the good perks then, which is an indictment of the system to be honest. Combat shouldn't be heavily imbalanced based on what cards you've been lucky enough to randomly receive. Imbalanced based on what you *chose* to equip is fine, but you shouldn't have to be at the whims of Lady Luck to such an extent.
---
 I've found one level 9 Perk card that's broken OP, and can't even use it as at lvl 9 I can't even equip the damn thing. I wouldn't have known such things exist otherwise.
---
Acceptable is whatever is necessary. 4 minutes, however, are not necessary at all. Period.
---
Oh and by the way - I am healthy, thank you. That might be, because I hit the gym twice a week for 1-2 hours, instead of doing pushups for 4 minutes every 20 Minutes (well.. actually might help :P ).
---
This list is useful, because it tells me that the rewards aren't worth pursuing. I quite like the NW mode, but would rather get a fistful of screws.
---

how do you guys enjoy reading the same fucking posts over and over again? why arent the mods creating a mega-thread for it?
---
Oh yeah, I was in the exact same boat. I launched a queen nuke to try out the nocturnal explosive gatling plasma that I just primed. Nobody showed up until like eight minutes in, and then a third guy showed up a bit later. We failed the event but the queen bugged out and stayed, we managed to kill her like five minutes after the event was gone. Then somebody else launched a queen nuke yesterday, I saw tons of people below level 80 and even some poor level 6 in a vault suit who I think was stuck in a cycle of dying due to rads and being unable to fast travel out. It took us almost the full 30 minutes to kill her. It feels just like queen fights back in December
---
It’s been happening to me too. Also came across an unowned workshop last night and the mission to claim it never came up, went to interact with it and it said I had to clear the remaining enemies but there were none.
---
Shit that looks nice.
---
What level 9 perk card is broken? Bloody mess? Stabilized? Tenderizer? Goat legs?
---
Maybe it’s just me then. I’m rank 40 and I win about 75% of my matches. 
---
I guess I just don’t need these perk cards unlike others, idk. 
---
The marsupial one isn’t even that good, people just seem to not know how to play.
---
I've had some good luck on pc. Especially with player vending machines. I found a bloodied/swing speed power fist for 2,000 caps at a vending machine. Got a bloodied/swing speed meat hook from the queen. And all of my unyielding gear were drops/purveyor acquired. The gear is mostly 2*, but it all still works. It takes some time, but the pay off is so good.
---
Are you playing on a small monitor or low resolution? It's relatively easy to see in the grass. It's only pretty much "invisible" inside the dark cabins in the center of the map
---
I've been going with hiding in a bush and being stealthy. Made it to 2nd place twice.
---
Only got 1 kill so far, a dude ran up on my hiding spot and I got him with my crossbow.
---
Yeah as others have said you can blueprint anything. From a small floor piece with a turret to an entire massive camp.
---
Be careful not to blueprint to large of a foot print as it can be hard to place, but what you are asking for is already a feature.
---
So I'm not the only one who spends most of the match hiding and doing nothing 😂
---
I'm playing in a 65" 4k TV. It's really not easy to see invis people in tall grass and bushes
---
Join the Encryptid even if you see it launch.  People drop like flies and always need reviving in that one.  There's also a large puddle of water people go down in which allows you to check off "revive someone in water".
---
Kind of playing fast and loose with your presumption of my intelligence there my man.
---
You’re not alone! Scared the begeesus out of me. Also hearing that wendigo breathing while your investigating the building for the first time is spooky.
---
I removed my vending machine to keep the rift raft from comin to my camp and hurtin my brahmin. I also have 2 barricades around my camp and turrets surrounding it so no one can get him.
---
Honestly can't stop laughing at the idea of 2 blind people firing machine guns at each other. I am not a good person.
---
Seen that in nuke zones, but not in regular areas.  Usually indicates the plant has been harvested, but for whatever reason, the image still shows ready to pick.
---
I dont spend alot of time adjusting prices, usually just go with what's recommended. Except when it comes to junk. But none of my junk prices are the same for the most part. I've never sold a magazine either. The hoarder deep inside me says I must have them all for myself. Same goes with bobble heads, packing around a good 40lbs of those things waiting for a bobble head stand and magazine rack for my camp.
---
I believe refrigerators were mentioned as future items when everyone lost their shit over the repair kits
---
I recieved my email about it yesterday
---
Ah, I haven't had that happen...yet. I tend to start cussing out small children if they get on a mic..but again, luckily..haven't had that happen in Nuclear Winter so far.
---
You can turn them off via .ini
---
Might be your lighting settings then. I'm only on a 28 inch computer screen and can see them just fine in the grass
---
Well maybe its just you're way of thinking that an emoji resembles a kid but thats just very presumptuous of you
---
I agree. There are so many posts about technical issues too where the poster doesn't even mention what platform they're on.
---
Clipboards, gotta pick them all up.
---
There you go! Use the time wisely! Balance your checking account, learn to dance, read a few pages in an manual on car repair.
---
I’ve been running around looking for deathclaw hides.  Everyone needs 5 of them for the Leather Possum badge challenge.  They’re very rare and people will pay a LOT for them.  Then I use the proceeds to buy better weapons, armor, etc.
---
Actually, a small portable scrapping station would suffice.
---
However....the nice thing about Campfire Tales is that all those insects usually drop everything you need.  Complete Campfire Tales, collect your bug parts, fast travel to Dolly Sods, and immediately complete Stings and Things as well.
---
My behaviour you mean ?? I couldn't quite understand
---
Asbestos, afaik it’s not very useful, not to me atleast, since I always end up with a ton of it because I’m constantly looting and scrapping cigarette packs only for plastic
---
Found an Unstoppable Monster for 1000 caps the other day, then got a 2nd one doing it myself.  My other BSS weapon is a Pole Hook which I found a while back in game myself.  Unyielding/Sentinel armor though - can't say I have even a single piece...  do have 1 Unyielding/Cavalier's, 2 junk weight reduction and 2 2*s.  Was lucky enough to be able to buy a nice Handmade and Gatling Gun for a lot of caps, that took a long time shopping the trade subs.
---
Coal. It's only real use is in one mutation serum, who is actually wasting time making water purifiers?
---
59 years, actually.
---
Ok
---
I dont see the reason why you would care if youre name is displayed and how it affects you in any way I dont see how it can be abused that people see you're name in a game
---
Why would you cuss out kids youre just doing the same thing they are lol
---
HOW DO YOU KILL PLAYERS IN THIS GAME FFS
---
It says in the imgur caption that the old bag is left and the new bag is right.
---
Well the LOD detail is definitely better, and Todd's statement was vague enough to mean almost anything (perhaps purposefully). Anyways, if you're hung up on that, well, I think you're looking for a reason to be mad, lol. It's not like you couldn't see what the game was going to look like before you bought it. :)
---
Hope you found the egress.
---
So what are you trying to say is that the game is still downloading and I don't have to cancel the download process?
---
I doubt that very much. Game can be gotten at little over 10€ and to these cheaters it's not about money only. They just want that power high they get for owning Lesser players.
---
Why is this a constant thing for people? This won’t do what you think it will. It will just disadvantage the people who don’t have all the time in the world to get back to where they once were.
---
People that can play everyday will always be light years ahead of others. Why punish the people who have been playing a long time?
---
What's weird is that since the last patch I have been randomly getting awarded legendary armor for completing events (Protest March in Grafton for example seems to give me one more often than any other event).  It's always 1* stuff, and its always armor, but it feeds nicely into the legendary exchange machine.
---
Ithink i saw something about vault 90 something dweller corpses on Reddit.
---
Issue 1 is subjective down to your own preference., issue 2 i cant say iv experienced that before on my X, issue 3 iv not had any hit delay or server issues in my month or so playing.
---
Stick to the ring of fire. There’s no real reason to be running to the middle of the zone when it’s not closing in.
---
Also, for the love of god, just put your quick kits down. Most quick walls deployed give you the same amount of coins as surviving for 10mins. You get 100+XP for EACH quick kit deployed, kills give 50XP
---
Save your grenades for downed enemies. Down an enemy, give a few seconds to see if their teammate goes for a revive, throw grenade; you’re getting at least one guaranteed kill
---
I thought the same, but usually it's just 1/2 -3/4 of the server are low levels running around the forest right now so I don't see them.
---
It's awesome but at the same time, I just want a vendor with a 1000 5.56 I can buy..
---
For 2, it's depth of field. They probably put it in so consoles can load the whole map at once, but I turned it off on PC because it gives me a headache. But if you think a ghoul in the floor is the worst you've seen in a bethesda game, you are one lucky person
---
Coming from the Anthem subreddit, I think I love this place.
---
Community managers that take suggestions FROM the community and bring it to the developers?
---
OMG YES YES YES.
---
Even if nothing happens (and I know 95% of the time it won't), this is still so damn refreshing.
---
Keeping an eye out for more of them on my travels.
---
They're all set up to apply to every power armor, except for Inferno which is locked to T45/51/60 and X-01
---
Don't know about how much stress that would put on the servers, but I like the idea
---
I'm sick of being all the way across the map and need to FT back across the map to my own camp, knowing its going to cost me 50 caps to get back to where I was
---
For next time: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/social/record-game-clips-game-bar-windows-10
---
I am happy to find out, that I'm not alone with my thoughts about Nuclear Winter. It's not for me. And yes, also waiting for Wastelanders.
---
Iron fist on punching weapons. Gladiator for one handed except the meathook used to work with both. Not sure if they patched that or not.
---
Hahaha. What a shit post. "Here is a list of absolutely minor items that affect the game play in no meaningful way and probably are not occurring for anyone other than me, the shit poster looking to complain about something. Why can't Bethesda get this right?" LOLOLOL
---
Maybe in the full version?
---
I like that you called one video game mode a waste of time, as if the other modes are super valuable.
---
There is a 0% chance that they're not already aware. They likely just have something else planned for them.
---
Genius thanks!
---
He's always been there, like the one near the top of the world. Keep hoping we'll find their individual stories on nearby terminals some day.
---
I don't understand your point. What's the purpose of survival mode for you? For brainless pvp, you have the new battle royale mode. BTW I play max 2 hours a day. Fallout is not a game that rewards no-lifers too much.
---
Have turned full screen on in the ini files?
---
congrats?
---
Also think to be fair you would have to limit it to one grenade at a time
---
Yeah, I’ve been starting a gaming session by playing a couple rounds before I switch back to Adventure. I like it, but it really hasn’t been worth my time in terms of caps/xp. I get more of a return spending three minutes clearing out a workshop and then claiming it.
---
I can reduce my Charisma, spoke to my team and none of them are sharing perk cards and are bothered about it really so that's handy haha
---
Ah a reformated copy pasta from folks who don't play survival. Survival is perfect. It's F76 just with out rules. That's all it needs to be. It's not competitive PvP. It's not going to be. Survival is hard mode and I love it. I suck at killing but I find adventure boring.
---
In survival there are no guarantees. Your uranium fever could get busted at any moment so instead of waiting for the next hoarder of miners your watching to door for a carat.
---
In adventure we just do emotes.
---
I prefer the danger just the way it is.
---
ZOMG I love Evolve. 
---
Having a 4 vs a super strong mutant, with everyone being player controlled would be awesome.
---
A horde mode with Scorched sounds amazing as well.
---
Hell, even an infected type scenario where it starts with 10 Scorched and 40 players sounds amazing. Get attacked by a Scorched melee and become Scorched after a 30 second timer expires. The mode is over in 20 minutes or when there are no more humans/Scorched remaining.
---
You don’t even get the kill when you down someone. You need to finish them
---
When Bethesda released their "fun player vending facts" a while back the top selling ammo listed were shotgun shells, fusion cores, 5.56, and .45
---
That and its half filled with level 2 players right now.
---
Just don't make it a requirement.  I hate it when subs do that.
---
I spent a load of time using workshop resources in adventure mode,
---
 making a load of Combat Building Blueprints, I.e. platforms with lots of cover, exits and multiple levels, mini bunkers, POI curiosities to bait players into standing in a specific place. I like the idea of it.
---
The problem is unlike fortnite, trying to build in combat is a death sentence. 
---
Lets say someone's shooting you and you want to build some cover, you have to go into your menu, select the option to move camp, place camp, hold down a button to go into build mode, scroll through your blueprints, find somewhere it'll actually place, press a button to slam it down, press button to exit build mode. Oh wait, you got to all of step two before being killed.
---
So building is only useful in a situation where you can expect combat in a specific place, and know there is nobody around at the time you want to build.
---
At which stage, what you've got is an obviously player made building sitting somewhere the enemy knows where you are. Meanwhile you don't know which direction the enemy is sneaking up on you, or hiding in a bush waiting for that pristine headshot angle. In a game mode heavily dependant on sniping for success, you're giving your assailants the advantage by attempting to build in most scenarios.
---
My guess is it will be reduced once we have full access to Vault 51.  It would make sense now since it is pre-beta and when it goes full beta (or whatever) then the vault can be searched in Adventure/Survival.
---
No it's not ok. Bethesda released crap. Unprecedented levels of crap. Buggy, muddy, unfinished, unpolished, I'll conceived crap. No good story line, no good sidequests, VATS is a joke, inventory system is crap, useless, poorly implemented survival mechanics that only detract from the experience. Horrible gun play that hasnt been updated in the slightest since fallout 3. Old, outdated engine that doesnt even support climbing ladders... in 2019!!. Predatory microtransaction policy, sending people garbage for the special edition when they were promised nice canvas bags, and then never making up for it, only giving 500 atoms as recompense. Tell me again how any of this is ok?
---
Many Unarmed weapons have a higher base damage than 1H or 2H melee weapons, so even though there's only one Iron Fist, it ends up balancing out.
---
The only Unarmed weapon which is affected by Iron Fist and Gladiator is the Meat Hook.  This is likely an unintentional oversight.  But the thing is, while you can spend 12 SPECIAL getting the Meat Hook maxed out with Gladiator and Iron Fist, the Meat Hook is inferior to the Power Fist and the Gauntlet weapons, so you're wasting a fair few SPECIAL points just bringing it into parity.  It also doesn't have natural armor penetration like the Power Fist does, and you'll only have a tiny bit of room in your Strength tree for perks like Incisor (armor penetration) or Martial Artists (swing speed, weight reduction).
---
Unarmed itself is completely viable, especially if you are Bloodied.  What's great is that the 3 ranks in Iron Fist leave a ton of space for other Strength perks, including Heavy Weapons if you want to have those as an option.  Like I said before, more Unarmed weapons are more powerful than 1H and 2H weapons - however, the downside to Unarmed is that you can't equip those weapons in Power Armor.  So, if you intend to go toe-to-toe with the Queen, you'll need something to get your Rad Resist up to about 100... and forget about Nuke Zones unless you're willing to be super squishy in a Hazmat Suit, or have a team running Rad Sponge.
---
Basically, it's hard to be *purely* Unarmed.  But you can take care of 90% of your problems with Unarmed.
---
i built there cause of the gold deposit
---
Yeah, it should be a choice, but it'd still be nice to have that choice.
---
That’s so untrue! The more you play, the more you’re rewarded by far! Especially when interacting with others.
---
It’s not brainless PvP either, you’re right that is NW. I like 76 PvP because it’s personal. Your characters build and gear vs another’s. 
---
I don’t understand why people have such a problem with people bringing their characters over? Just don’t go to survival until your tough, otherwise if you do go in just lay low.
---
Why do you want to ruin it for people that really enjoy the mode how it is?
---
Thats probably what will happen with full release. This is effectively a beta for nuclear winter dont forget.
---
I was just thinking the same thing. Adventure lacks that sense of urgency that Nuclear Winter conveys. I can sit and rummage through my stash box for long periods of time and don't have to worry about bursting into flames.
---
i hit it before the new system
---
Well, yea. This is just a pre beta, I don't expect to see any changes until they push our beta, likely won't even see all features until NW is released.
---
If it’s lead you’re looking for head to the lucky hole mine with excavator PA and mine up all the lead ore, each run and smelting with the super duper perk I can get around 1,000 lead scrap, and if your making your own ammo make sure to pick up the ammo smith perk.
---
had been wanted for months
---
Your character's SPECIAL in Adventure is what determines your SPECIAL in NW. However you can only have 7 perk cards total in NW. So if you have 6/5/8/8/8/5/9 in Adventure, you can load any 7 cards you want, but for example the A cards must not exceed a value of 5. Does that make sense?
---
Reload speed is capped, and Speed Demon gets you all the reload speed pretty much, plus those guns just don't take very long to reload.  Damage resistance is far less useful especially once you get into the 400-500 range with PA, that little extra is a waste of perk points.  Damage reductions are always the way to go when you have the option and with a lot of melee enemies out there, Blocker is a top tier perk to run.
---
Gunsmith 5 helps but its taking up far too many perk points.  Repairing your weapons with Weapon Artisan already gets them double durability.  Just repair them to 200% and don't waste the perk points.  This is where I'd pull perk points from into others.  2 into your Endurance, 3 to Perception.  Once you get into the higher levels and are done with your build, you'll be swimming in enough materials that the extra repairs won't hurt too badly.  Since you have Bear Arms I assume you're going to have more than just 1 heavy energy weapon too.
---
For day to day non boss battles, use Adrenaline 1 with Thru Hiker 3 and 1 point into something else like maybe Born Survivor, then you can switch in Adrenaline 5 as needed.
---
Super creepy picture
---
Yup got mine too. Really didn’t care I bought my PA Edition for, well, the PA but I can’t complain about having two free bags.
---
This happens outsixe of scorched earth too! Any scorched creature, likely because the perk lets you eat scorched and scorched creatures probably have the same tag that allows for cannibalization. I ate a bunch of mirelurks during a messenger event once.
---
I shot someone with two direct headshots and they didn't go down. Tell me again how its good?
---
  When I first started playing, I did't know anything about nukes/dragons, or specific builds.
---
   I selected perks that helped the weapon that was working best for me, which at the time was either an axe or a machete - I agree with you, guns/shotguns felt weak in the early levels.
---
It's one of the reasons I ended up as melee player (even though in all previous iterations, I was a gunner)
---
That said, Good doggy and bloody mess are good choices.  
---
If you will be playing solo more often than team, I would not spend too many points in Charisma - most of them are team oriented.
---
Its possible neither of you had completed the quest, so while he got credit the first time, now its your "turn" to complete the task.  Do you still have the quest when he is not on the team?
---
I'm just trying to be prepared for all possible outcomes
---
I actually like this to a certain extent. Most modes like this simply turn into mindless death matches. What's refreshing about this version is there's a few different ways a team can win.
---
Love eating me a scorched fog crawler
---
There's a dead vault dweller in Harper's Ferry too.
---
Aww.  Back at ya.
---
I think we need to get xp for where the team finishes in the match even if you die early on. I’ve had matches where one of my teammates died early on and we ended up winning or finishing like third or whatever and they only got like 30 xp because of how long they survived. They should get more for wherever the team finishes if they stay until the end, as some that solo leave the team when they die.
---
Your forgot this /s
---
Yeah, there's an absolute ton of new players
---
Sounds great to me, thank you!
---
I mean, if you have a video of them flying through the air in a suit of power armor never landing, or standing under the ground firing through the surface with one shot kills, if you post the video of it you aren't really 'name dropping' you're just posting a video, right?
---
😂I😂don't😂know😂what😂you😂mean😂
---
Turn off YouTube reviews and controversy mongers and either play or dont play the game.
---
Oh god please Do, I made the perfect fortress inside a Monorail tower but I need like, 5% more budget for all the furnishings
---
Funnily enough no sooner did I read this I entered the game with shots already being fired.
---
i can finally see ppl selling items
---
Hey now Ill have you know that some of us have 9 agility for Frog Legs in NW.
---
Also things.
---
Yeah out of the blue I got a shipping notice, it's on the truck. I have to say, Bethesda is a stand up company. Everyone makes mistakes, but they are making good and that's not something you can say about everyone.
---
Bone is completely useless, you need it for crafting/repairing a few niche weapons, but my level 233 guns character does not need it for anything at all. 
---
Cork ends up being useful later for armor mods, either ultra-light or deep pocketed, I don't remember which. 
---
Glass is good for making marine tactical helmets for really quick caps, but if you don't have the plan then you don't need it, since yeah it's very easy to find.
---
Syringer ammo is really the only useless one in this game, since all of the barrels are either a gimmick or not even good enough to take out a level 10 scorched. The explosive ammo might not be worth it for you if you don't have perks to reduce heavy weapon/explosive ammo weight, but they are still useful in the game if you can carry them.
---
I would also add cloth to the list. It's way too common and isn't used nearly as often as it is found. Leather is pretty much only used for crafting and repairing certain armors, so you can keep around a small supply of that once you finish modding your armor.
---
2. As someone has stated, most areas are somewhat level locked, but if a high level player has been by recently and not killed them it may have spawned high level bad guys. Just be aware of the level of enemies you're facing, don't rush into areas if you're unsure and if they are too much for you just fall back and come back another time.
---
If you don't want to level up through the quests until higher level then just cautiously explore all the areas and don't do the quests. Take your time exploring up and down the map through all the different areas just for the sake of seeing what's there. If the enemies are too high level then just leave, but if you take your time moving from the starting areas then you'll level up pretty quick just exploring and fighting the enemies you come across.
---
I did this until I was level 50 before getting into anything other than the initial responder quests so that the quest rewards would be at the highest level so I wouldn't outgrow them too quick and they would be more useful.
---
I just recently ran through West Tek for the first time. That first time I had 8 legendary enemies spawn. Since then, I’m lucky if I see 1-2. Sometimes I don’t see any at all. RNG is a cruel mistress.
---
Thank you for all your help.
---
I have made some alterations based on what someone else said as well, and liked what they said about possibly using a laser rifle for a secondary.
---
What do you think? thank you again for all the fantastic help.
---

---
If i remember correctly, if you carry too much weight, the only place you can respawn in is the vault 76.
---
You need it for marine armor crafting/repairs iirc. But yeah, you find it way more often than you need it
---
Thanks for doing this
---
Idk, my brand new nice canvas bag has shipped and I will have it in a couple days. So, seems ok to me.
---
Everything else you suggested is purely opinion. Have an OK day!
---
I will give you the severs have been a little wonky due to the massive influx of players overloading them. A bit laggy.
---
  I do however disagree about the graphics.  They look sexy to me on ultra.  
---
  Fallout isn't for everyone. Good luck finding the game your looking for.
---
No doubt. I never really stand still but I also don't sprint around a lot either. Lol. So sentinel/cavalier never appealed to me. I do have a chameleon/sentinel/endurance heavy combat arm. That was a purveyor drop. But I use level 3 sneak and level 2 melee sneak attack. I can casually sneak through west tek without ever really alerting all the baddies. I really want unyielding with FDC reduction so I don't have to use those 3 points in strength for traveling pharmacy. But I kind of hate how the player trade market has gotten so I just make due with what I got for the most part.
---
I think a fresh character and no legendaries with the weapon balancing of NW would be cool. I like the ttk in NW way better than survival atm
---
Seriously.
---
The whole premise of growing stronger in a harsh world that is survival mode is exciting by itself. That's why games such as Ark or Rust were so successful. 
---
" Why do you want to ruin it for people that really enjoy the mode how it is? "
---
I could say: Why do you want to ruin it for everyone else? Why do you want to have all the modes for casual friendly people who only jump into survival mode when they feel godlike and can't be touched? Adventure mode with slap system was doing just that. Survival mode should be something entirely different. If you don't understand why, please read the original post again.
---
I bought 2 copies. 1 for me 1 for my gf. $120 dollars and hours of my life. Gone. Dont fucking tell me I cant have an opinion on this fucking steaming pile of corporate spunk!
---
Ahh ok, makes sense that I don’t know that, im still using power armor while I assemble an unyielding set haha
---
The most annoying thing for me is the fact that you can get duplicate cards. I'm level 20 and it takes so long to get new card packs and then you finally get one and it's a fricking dupe! I checked another thread for all  the cards that exist and I don't even have like 1/3 of 'em.
---
thank you for giving some actually good info, unlikely these other jackasses. guess i will be getting the game after all. thanz
---
Yeah. I don't see the level 2 players much, but the decreased number of high-level camps with vending on each server is a big change. The map used to be covered in shops. Now, I'm seeing between 2 and 5.
---
I would prefer Vats to be completely deleted from the controls in NW and have that button be something more useful such as a quick use for equipment or even just pull up the equipment wheel.  For controllers, i cant stand having to take my movement away in order to change equipment.
---
In my opinion, could just do a tad bit more to refine aiming and combat controls so its a bit more smooth (compared to some other shooters today), then vats is no longer necessary as a crutch like when it was back during FO3 and New Vegas.  They did a pretty good job thus far in the last patch but could still use a bit more refinement.
---
Totally true, but I like to try and live off the land. Cook food, brew tea, soups make healing salves ect ect.  Don’t use chems and only use stimpaks during heavy combat when death is imminent. So for me personally just a portable cooking station would suffice. To be able to craft or scrap would for me just be a double bonus.
---
Gonna be awkward if everybody starts doing that lol.
---
Yeah, but they are only making good because of the backlash.
---
I'd appreciate assists, 100%
---
Works fer me...not just a clever name.
---
This game isn’t Ark or Rust, and their attempt at that I believe would be closer to NW. 
---
Doing what you’d want, wiping people’s characters, would just be a major kick in the ass for those that really like the RPG aspect for this game, building their own unique character
---
I love Bethesda and 76, but they don't get praise for this. It's just cleaning up a mess that shouldn't have happened.
---
I always have too much steel and wood but I wouldn't call them useless. I'll probably have to dump some eventually to free up inventory space.
---
I got two checks completed when I completed tasks in Adventure for some reason and the last 3 I just repeated the ones I already did since they didn't mark as complete in Adventure.
---
I felt dirty claiming that gun but it's not like I could return the objectives...
---
Haha, thanks, already tried this a couple of times tho, unfortunately it didn't help that much in my case.
---
May I ask what your computer specs are ?
---
“My good sir” stop
---
It clearly was not a mistake as many people bought it.
---
A scrapping station or portable grill, either one wouldn't be too hard I wouldn't think.
---
Cause your hair looks like shot and so does your toilet 🤪
---
You can try the chameleon serum.
---
The Purveyor is probably your best bet
---
Yeah that's bums me out. Downing someone who then dies should benifit you
---
Such a sad but sweet story. Why not have your own 21 gun salute in Appalachia with some other users? I'm sure you would find willing participants. I'm on PC or I'd join in. :)
---
I didnt even get a shipping notice so it was a welcome surprise!!!
---
Millions of duped items is definitely an exaggeration, unless you're counting every nuka-grape and ultracite bullet. But I agree, survival mode has already been dead for a while because nobody likes getting TSE spammed out of the bushes. The weekly survival weapon challenges are just barely enough to keep it afloat. Nuclear winter has shown that people prefer PvP without vats, legendaries, or the risk of losing their hard earned loot. My only issue with that would be that the survival weapons would become survival-exclusive because they bind to your character, but honestly it wouldn't be that big of a loss
---
There was nothing reformated or copy pasted in my post. 
---
" I prefer the danger just the way it is. "
---
There is no danger, because you only join survival mode with full godlike gear and cards, only in the time you feel like. There is no danger in jumping overprepared into a mode. Knowing that you have to do everything while looking over your shoulder constantly, no matter if you have gear or not, no matter if you look for trouble or just go pick up corn in the nearby field, that's the real danger.
---
Where’s that? I’m still kind of newbie
---
Mine's to be delivered tomorrow, though shows in my town this morning at 6 AM.  Hoping gets updated to today.  How does it feel, pretty sturdy?
---
Exactly! Thank you. I’m so sick of posts like these. All of these butthurt people who can’t compete and want Bethesda to level the playing field for them.
---
Why don’t I go hop onto ESO even tho I don’t play it, go into PvP, get killed by someone that does play everyday, and complain to Bethesda all of the high level players need a nerf for it to be “fair”
---
Get over it!
---
But still making good is better than not!!
---
haha... me too!  I would run to the gazebo and grumble "there's no friggin' fountain here!!".  And then one day I happened to notice the little drinking fountain off to the side and felt like a dolt.
---
You only need one piece of chameleon, and it’ll make you invisible when crouched and not moving.
---
If you're getting high-level "batteries included" and "gunsmith" perks, then laser rifles are probably a good move for early on in the game, since you can craft and equip them early on, whereas heavy guns aren't really going to be available for a while, so that's a sensible hybrid approach. 
---
What platform are you playing on, by the by?
---
This is what I do whenever I’m not put on a team. You can literally crouch in a bush for the entire game.
---
It is *very* easy to miss.  Just enter the gazebo and circle around its perimeter.  You'll come to it
---
Fully agreed. Faction PvP would be great, here's hoping Wastelanders does something like that. I mean it'll slowly add in Human factions. We'll have Settlers/Responders  (Apparently) and Raiders. Next I imagine will be Brotherhood of Steel, Free States and any Enclave survivors or Enclave recon teams from Washington D.C.
---
Yeah, nor are they contagious. Cannibals...maybe? Scorched have a skin to skin virus so that would make the most since.
---
That's why I normally build something small to draw attention then sit and wait nearby for someone to investigate. And I've thought about this, which speeds the process up a little bit, but you could just walk around with your CAMP ready do you can place it the instant you're in combat.
---
Haha, I guess that'll work for now!
---
Looks awesome! All about those PA skins.
---
Same, I wanna give them a Brotherhood Recon rifle and a few clips of .308.
---
How BS is it to die in the final fight and get a lot less because of it..
---
How about both?
---
Same, I think we need both of these emotes.
---
Ah okay thank you, I have removed them two perks and added blocker and traveling pharmacy.
---
I see what you mean with gunsmith but not sure what to put in it's place as currently got a space point after adding fireproof and the commandos like you said.
---
I was going to have all heavy weapons so that's why I had Bear Arms, but if i'm going to have laser rifles as well i'm not sure now.
---
Currently got it to 15/6/3/4/14/5/8 missing one point but not sure where to put it.
---
Your best bet would be anywhere you farm regular legendaries since it's all random. You can trade stuff you don't want for scrip and get more random stuff from the mole miner vendor at Berkley station in the mire. Otherwise, you can try trading people for the armor you want, by offering stuff they might want. Some people can be quite generous.
---
I support this. 
---
Only because it will make you a huge target and give me an increased chance of getting a kill.
---
Nah, they were all hyperbole and just you repeating what others have already said in their attempts to make money off a troubled game launch. No one is refuting them because they frankly aren't work anyone's time. If you had your own opinions, or the capacity to form and communicate them, you wouldn't just be reposting the same rehashed rantings that dozens of influencers have been making videos about for the past 9 months to pad their wallets and sew controversy. 
---
Next.
---
45 hps can be life or death. I don’t know what your talking about.
---
this!
---
I thought the cheats that mattered were already worked out of the game? Are there really still bugs/exploits/etc that are out there to watch out for? Is there just a case of new players misunderstanding what they are seeing?
---
There was a similar mode in doom 2016.
---
I’ve had that happen so many times because of that stupid scorchbeast
---
For weapons I've been trading but its so much harder to do it for armor pieces.  FDC reduction isn't always that wanted, if its not Sentinel/Cavalier's, most people want WWR so you might still have a shot at trading for it.
---
I have 1 Chameleon piece on my characters, and its nice having some Improved Sneak too, so I wouldn't really see myself running a full sentinel/cavalier's set either.
---
45 hp is also a starting card.
---
It would be, but it does work well
---
No one wants to wipe your character. Just keep it where it was created, leveled and geared - in a peaceful, casual mode.
---
The fact this is a ''pre-beta'' according to their website makes me excited about how fleshed out and awesome this mode will be when it's fully released. It's in a good place now, but if they plan on tweaking and working on it more we're in for a treat.
---
I find the wet logs helpful if I'm intending on doing the insect parts scout quest afterward.  You can collect most if not all of the bug parts in the campfire quest and then just go start and immediately turn in the bug parts quest.
---
I know, it's what I always do. Pkease stop encouraging others ;)
---
Sweet Mutfruit Tea and Seared Venison with Berries are two that spring to mind. Certainly those requiring purified water are in the minority and may perhaps be linked to their more potent results.
---
Ok thanks
---
Can you read made? Did you even try? That's totally not the point. I couldn't care less if someone stronger kills me. I thought this community was a bit more intelligent.
---
Open map persistent world multi-faction PvP would be a dream come true.  I've played a ton of Planetside 2 which has 3 factions engaged in constant warfare.
---
Indeed, but I really hope the mode doesn't just go away until it's deemed ready.
---
Even in its current state, the game is a blast and pulled me away from Fortnite.
---
You should be able to explore the vault for as long as you want. When you're ready to join a game, press a button and the game should match you up in under a minute. That is how it should be.
---
1. Basically, quest progress only counts for the Leader.  Other players will receive credit for helping them to complete it, but their personal instance of that quest will not be completed.  If you want to pass the baton, you use the Promote to Leader function in the Social menu.  It's awkward when it comes to things like Daily quests, which might be what you experienced.
---
2. I see this maybe once or twice a week.  Kind of a newish bug, actually.  I think what actually happens is that the game gets confused as to what it wanted to spawn there, and so it ends up spawning some enemies in positions intended for others.  Like, it has the spawn positions for a Radrat, but it wound up spawning a Ghoul instead.
---
3. The player is somewhat squishy compared to enemies (which is why PvP always had awkward balancing).  I play melee myself and I think that every player should have one melee weapon on them, if only to conserve ammo.
---
4. Because Revolvers and Bolt Action guns suck.  There are ways to speed up reload times, but in general, there's a reason why most players gravitate away from those weapons.
---
5. That entirely comes down to what you want your character to be.  If you are melee, for example, Strength is everything.  I would say that the stat that I consistently wish I had more points in is probably Luck, because there's a ton of interesting stuff in there.  Conversely, Perception is kind of dull and Endurance is the "How many points do you want to invest in avoiding things you don't like doing?" tree.
---
Ssshhhhhh dont give out the secret Bethesda might nerf it if it's too public lol
---
Downliad
---
Vault 51 should be accessible without opting into NW matchmaking.  And then if we do opt into matchmaking for NW, as soon as there are 52 players, the timer immediately drops to 5 seconds and then we have the map for location selecting popup if that makes sense.  Ive had multiple games where we have 52 players in the lobby (or so it says) but we have to wait 2 minutes still to start.  At that point, just cut right to the map and lets go.
---
The one thing i do like about NW is the fact that theres no parachuting in or airdropping.  That right there can be another 30 seconds to a minute of down time and i never cared for that on top of the minute it usually took me to get the game just started.
---
its what you get when you eat food and dont waist 3 perk points on lead belly
---
?
---
While I agree I think they have to worry about leaving it and it having something ground breaking happen which would drive everyone back off. At least if they remove it and add it back once 100% complete you wouldn't have as many ''told ya so'' players/haters.
---
I don't know why every game doesn't use Overwatch's system of keeping track of both your damage and kill count (and any kill you contribute to at all counting as a kill). That should be the industry standard.
---
At Berkley springs station which is not far from Berkley springs west workshop, if you see any player vendors near there fast travel &amp; go to the end of the train line
---
You need legendary stuff to scrap though, so do all of the horde events on the left side of the map
---
Ha, I did a purge of the shizzy plans and recipes, best move I made. I just wish there was a camp storage container equivalent of a train station suitcase to put all the “Free - Take One!” Items...
---
Theres a reason BR is doing so well, and its not because of the game mode itself.
---
I am sorry for your loss. I lost my Grandma very recently. I would sing the songs from her day with her that I knew from Fallout :)
---
Couldnt be more wrong lol. Fortnite was a single player or multiplayer campaign game that has a BR added on (game took4 years to develop while the br took 6m). BR got more popular and took center stage. Not to mention when you play fortnite br they removed all the lore and bullshit to focus on BEING A BR.
---
Long load times are just to allow everyone to load smooth while it's in trial/sneak peak/beta. Once they know they can make fixed to have consistent load times they'll reduce it. The 2 minutes is to stabilize the server. And to allow perk cards to be equipped.
---
Well several things here could have easily happened. First and most likely, you didn't. Next is they were wearing marine armor or power armor (like I already said). Third is they have very defense oriented perks and or had chems going.
---
Want me to tell you again how its good? Okay
---
&gt; I've won games with the scoped combat rifle. You can knock teams of people before they know whats happening because of its fast fire rate, just takes 1 headshot and body shot a person and boom, win. The exception is if they're in marine or power armor, then its just 2 headshots, which is also pretty easy to accomplish due to the small recoil and quick fire rate.
---
This is the only one I liked doing. The big parts are too much of a hassle for slim chance at the desired reward.
---
I played it for the first time last night and surprised I enjoyed it.    My biggest complaint is how much the cash shop appears in the game though.  I see so many cash shop icons it makes it feel like a free to play game (not a good thing)  I try to ignore it but they are literally all over.  Really bothered me.
---
I stay out of the common paths, but kill people when I can. I run a commando/heavy guns build so I'll mix that in with a fair bit of close quarter flanking if possible. Stealth is very important for that, you're not going to sneak behind anybody if you sound like bigfoot stomping through the bushes. It's awesome when you walk in on a fight between two groups and get to clean up whoever is left alive
---
Because fresh meat and rotten food are two different things
---
I missed out on that you were able to keep 14 in Intelligence while moving points around otherwise.  Given how great mutations are, I think you should reduce your Intelligence to 11 and get Luck to 11 so you can run Class Freak and One Gun Army together along with Bloody Mess and Starched Genes.  I swap perks a lot, but my Luck setup almost never changes, only Super Duper when crafting.
---
But it’s meat
---
Try fully closing the launcher and start it back up.
---
yes make the player wanted 
---
a cow should b e at least 500 caps
---
I was also a Vats shotgun before I switched to big guns. I would dump a good bit of points into luck. I ran with 3 in four leaf clover and had a crit almost every other shot. Like said above Enforcer is a must have. I would also suggest the 1 shotgun perk with increased reload and weight reduction and also the other one in perception. It has been so long since I used a shotgun cant remember the perk cards.
---
That I can complete completely relate with!
---
I tried. It didn't work..
---
List of all perks, what they do, and at what level they become available:
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks)
---
I don't get a crash to desktop, but what I've gotten with annoying frequency since Patch 9 is this thing where fast traveling to a CAMP will cause the audio to pop and the screen never fades from black after the load.  It's very obnoxious and I have to restart the game every time it happens.
---
It seems like it may not happen if I fast travel to a marked location instead of a CAMP.
---
This week was basically a stress test.  It will be back when the full nuclear winter update is released.
---
There is only one person that can tell you if you will enjoy this game or not, and its **you** so try it.
---
Admittedly i do not have rifleman but it shouldn't take 3 headshots to down a target when I can down someone with 1 using a hunting rifle.
---
Do you mean the animation? Versus just looting the meat and eating it?
---
Drugs.
---
Seriously, some of the drugs say ‘-25%’ damage.
---
Gear
---
I see that... my bad. OP is just a liar, then.
---
I was hoping they were going to create a new map area north of the Vault for NW. That way it could fit in the world and make sense.
---
Nope. Probably not even an update.
---
Then play survival.
---
But you need to find a player vendor who sells it. You also need the starched genes perk card which is not available at his level. You would also only be able to use a full set of weightless armour.  1000% easier just to find/buy a single piece of chameleon armour
---
Thank you so much! I would love cross-play but I appreciate your comment!
---
Yeah if it works like fallout 4 does I noticed higher single damage hits get resisted more with a % over a base DR/ER.  So having suppressor might be a good option. However if I take away suppressor and pull points away from charisma to throw into lifegiver and fireproof with the added endurance that might be better since the charisma stat doesnt really do much on its own.
---
Having said that does lifegiver work well with nerdrage and bloodied? the extra health offset well with the amount of benefits from nerd rage and bloodied bonus on weapons? How often am I going to be damaged with explosions and fire? I honestly havent had much of an issue and I can usually avoid explosions. If I get hit I figure with the other defense bonuses in the build it might not matter much in those situations. being PVE I don't expect to be in PVP where that might be more of a factor.
---
Yep I already have Lone Wanderer so no worries there. I am doing Tenderizer to try something new. Does a bonus 7% more damage to target for 10 seconds after I attack. So a slight burst of damage. Not as great as psycho chem, but its something that is passive.
---
My strength is already 15 with 9 points into Slugger cards for two handed damage. martial artist 3 for faster swings and weight loss on weapon, then Incisor 3 for weapons ignore 75% of enemy armor.
---
I could in barbarian but that would pull away from the glass cannon build for damage. I plan on getting healing factor mutation to offset damage i heal outside of battle.
---
If I took serendipity and blocker it would pull away from damage in str and luck. If those are not taken perhaps I wouldn't survive encounters as well? In any event here is my build. Mutations included. Although I'm on the fence about scaly skin for that -50 AP.
---
The ghoul thing is more bad luck, I've been playing quite a bit in the past few weeks and only saw this happen once in whitesprings. Guns are rather underpowered compared to melee, especially in the end-game once legendary armor and weapons come into play. A bloodied swing speed deathclaw gauntlet or super sledge with unyielding armor has no competition from any firearms in the game, period
---
But it’s spoiled...
---
But then they'll need weightless armour if they want the benefits of armour like shadowed.
---
Ewww ugly
---
I prefer the 50cal due to no wind-up but ammo is much more expensive.
---
Thank you so much, it is definitely very difficult for me especially right now but I am dealing with it. Thank you again!
---
Try to see if you can validate files. 
---
Another option is to do a PC power cycle. 
---
Or uninstall the launcher and try again. 
---
Or try to go to the support page if there any articles published of the problem or submit a help ticket.
---
Yeah, I pick up a lot of it from anglers just to sell. I don't think I've ever fallen below 50 in my stash, and I only keep a couple in my inventory at a time
---
Wow... just wow. No it's not my opinion that the servers crash when you drop nukes. And they're just now sending the bags and you're ok with that? That's fucking sad. Hold their feet to the fire and maybe somthing will change. Bend over and take it, and nothing will change. Have an OK day yourself, corporate milk cow.
---
Killing and AI enemy twice is the same as killing one actual player in my experience... that seems wrong since most only take a few hits
---
That’s really odd. I’ve never seen that before.
---
Just look up a guide on YT
---
There's a train station in the mire, north-west of harpers ferry, the big town in that area.
---
so to clearify this: you play a BR but you dont like how BR works?
---
Carnivore doesn't affect spoiled meat.
---
It's still a much bigger barrier of entry than creating a new bethesda account, which takes a minute and costs nothing. It wouldn't get rid of everybody, but at least a good chunk of the cheaters
---
Thank you for your personal story as well, I have always used video games to escape reality but it took a whole new meaning when I lost him, haven't left Appalachia since! Thank You again!
---
I did that with one hacker and this was Bethesda's response "navigate to the social menu and block them"
---
No it isn't.  Chemically rotten meat is different then fresh meat.  Rotten meat is why buzzards evolved to eat it. They will eat meat that is too rotten for other carnivores like lions or hyenas.
---
You go into your inventory and drop it like you would drop other items. It can then be claimed by anyone else. If you place it, then it’s still yours.
---
This isn't Fortnite. I think it's good that people have to manage stamina like a Fallout game instead of sprinting endlessly like cartoonish madmen and jumping over and over to avoid head shots.
---
flexing boi
---
And super duper is essential.
---
Since vats is removed, they should turn the vats keybind into a ping
---
It changes with each weapon unfortunately so you'll have to e more specific.
---
Try it and find out. Nobody can tell you if the things that bothered you are adequately fixed except you.
---
Or it’s a simulation like in Fallout 3 and 4 with the pods. 
---
We will know more when it fully launches with more lore and maybe an introduction quest.
---
There are free games they can do that in (apex legends).
---
Wasn’t their a time were it did a couple patches ago?
---
my gamertag is cmccoy6, I will not be able to play much today as I am still packing for the weekend and I will be gone for a part of next week as well but after I come back I am definitely going to be getting on and having something for him I have has so much support on and outreach on Reddit and Facebook a lot of players want to join in and pay respects and I really appreciate it. Thank you again!
---
...my good...human? 🤔
---
This is an old post but how do you throw the dross? When I go to equip it, it shows as equipped in my pip boy but my other weapon is still in my hands. No button is working too throw the dross.
---
I started carrying and wearing a full set of Ghoul slayer armor whenever I go to Whitesprings. Makes a huge difference to have 60% anti-ghoul shield in effect. Find some with extra rad resistance and manage the rest of the radiation with RadX or other means.
---
That and I use Glow Sight to make the glowing ones more vulnerable.
---
enemy specific weapons and armor is awesome if you can afford the weight to carry it
---
They wouldn't DARE take my 10 levels away from me, they wouldn't DARE
---
I'm not asking for infinite stamina here. Just more than 0 stamina would he nice. The speed that it drain and the time it takes to refill is rediculous. It needs some adjusting. That's all I'm asking for
---
“Makes a suggestion”
---
DOwnVoTe harharhar
---
Never did. It wasn't intented for that use. Spoiled stuff was meant to be used for fertilizer while having mutations for carnivore or herbivore was meant to make you eat straight without cooking.
---
Yeah thats the one! 
---
P.S. I'm so hypppeeddd for the human NPCs!!
---
Gatling Plasma is more precise due to lower firerate, I also think it has higher base dps. But explosive won't add any damage to the plasma one so the Cal 50 might be better if it has the right perks
---
Come to survival! It has that danger.
---
And ignore all the people saying it's terrible. They dont play survival.
---
Now don't start talkin crazy!
---
You're clearly a fucking troll. Honestly the game has improved dramatically since launch. I have no idea what you're on about.
---
Probably just remembered wrong :-)
---
Only played 2 rounds but this is exactly why I haven’t since. Second round my squad wanted to land right in the action so I ran for 30 seconds found a gun turned around and done. 
---
Back to the main menu. Load it all up again or quit? I just didn’t go back. Granted I never really was all that interested in the mode but figured I would at least try it out, seems fun enough but if I wanted endless loading I’d just play New Vegas.
---
I agree they should use the whole map. But this is the full version. Ppl keep saying 'when the full version comes out', but this is it. They're making sure that this works. they wouldn't introduce an entire section of map that they haven't beta tested. I understand that this is a trial. but i think this is the endgame i would assume they only make improvements to the current area
---
Found it thanks I only have 21 of the currency so ill save up
---
This Probably isn't the place for this particular feedback but i wanted to share it just in-case though.     I Think this issue also happens in Adventure Mode too.      Yesterday When I was playing NW a teammate of mine was off doing his own thing and i heard gunshots so i went to his area and he was fighting a Megasloth.    So i took aim with my sniper rifle and shot and killed it with him.     Next thing you know he starts SCREAMING over the mic how i was an asshole and i stole his elite kill.     Meanwhile i'm over here thinking well what the hell did i do wrong.  He Then Proceeded to tell me to stay away from him and he was done.     Which Brings me to my point on how team kills need to be a thing and "Killing Blows" need to be given to the whole team and not just the one lucky person.     I still don't understand why he was upset i am thinking over an achievement or something but this is also ties in with being awarded XP or something for helping land shots on enemy combatants.
---
I think they know the wait times and load screens vs actual in game time is not balanced. I hope they speed up the start of match stuff and make Vault 51 explorable via the PVE world.
---
Getting credits for downing someone is already an improvement over kill shots only mattering. I'll give them credit for that.
---
Seems like a tall order.
---
See, this is where I know you're full of shit. Simple math confirms that you can either not knock someone with 1 shot from hunting rifle (which does sub 140 damage with no perks) or you're definitely knocking them with 2 shots from combat rifle (which does over 90). Even with the way DR works, two shots of combat rifle deal more damage than 1 from hunting rifle.
---
ah ok, thank your for the explanation, it seems like a good idea to me
---
I just got blue camo paint for power armour, I think at level 15? 😁
---
Knowing Bethesda they have just forgot about 'em.
---
Not really , it's common sense to do those things but they don't do it anyway
---
Dude, you can pjck it up for like 20 bucks.
---
I highly recommend getting Chemist and making Diluted Stimpacks and Diluted Radaways. That’s far more valuable than using it for cooking. 
---
And you can go to almost any water source and pop a Rad-X or put on a Hazmat Suit and just soak the collect button to get hundreds of Dirty Water. And if you need Wood Scraps to boil it, go to Sylvie &amp; Sons Logging Camp, use Woodchucker, and get about 400-500 Wood Scraps in about 1 minute. 
---
I usually have so much Boiled/Dirty Water I end up dropping it or ‘selling’ it for 0 caps in my vendor, or giving like 50+ to new players. 
---
Since Dirty/Boiled Water is so much easier to get, it makes no sense to use Purified Water for cooking. Maybe they should add some ‘high end’ recipes that use it, but not for just general use.  
---
YMMV.
---
Lol take the tin foil hat off would ya. I have launched countless nukes myself, been in world's where multiple nukes have dropped at once and the game didn't crash. Sure it happens, but every time, stop making a huge issue out of a rare one. 
---
Considering I didn't really care about the bag anyway, yeah I'm Ok with that. They offered to make it right and I accepted, yup, I'm Ok with that.
---
Seemingly they are doing what they can to make it better while fulfilling the promises of more content. That doesn't happen overnight. Each patch has made improvements whether you like it or not.
---
Theres a perk for eating spoiled food
---
Brotherhood of Steel flagpole/wall decor/barricade skin, please!
---
Uh same goes for our Enclave counterparts too with the Enclave logo etc.
---
I feel like the GP is going to have higher damage per shot, and it uses cores vs bullets which might make it easier to feed. 
---
I've found that for smaller targets things like the GL and .50 cal are better. For bigger targets, like SBs, I like a higher damage per shot weapon to punch through their resists and take them down quicker, like a GP or Gatling Gun.
---
Thank you for your extremely kind comment, I know its a text block with no breaks and it might be hard to read, i am relatively new to Reddit and I figured that it would make some users slightly upset because of the way its set up but with this weekend coming I wanted to get it out there. I am really sorry to hear about your loss as well, these things are always hard to talk about and I am glad you shared your story, my connection to him is how we used to work on things together and how he always wanted me to go back home with him for a few weeks to show me around, I wish you were on the same console because that would be amazing, maybe I'll pick one and try it myself in honor of your Aunt. Thank you again
---
Presumably that's the internal name for Nuclear Winter.
---
I do this all the time! I feel I’ve been conditioned by previous games in which all ammo, chems and pre-war money weigh 0, and now I’m constantly dropping .38 ammo and thousands of cloth scrap from my stash!
---
I know for a fact a base hunting can down in anything under marine with a headshot. Typically takes 2 body shots to bring them down in the same.
---
I've found that the tall defense walls + shorter defense walls on the outside around a 2x2 to 3x3 foundation tower is pretty sturdy and if you cut it down to 1 foundation, you can fit a small patch of crops in there too.  At that point, you basically only need to worry about molerats and radscorpions.
---
I think it's pretty good. Forces you to strategize your movements.
---
I want a "base" and I want a "camp". The base I can build near other people at a hub that has plots. A camp that I can plop down anywhere and not worry about .. shit.. now I wont have my resource genarator or cool camp build anymore than I spent hours on.. 
---
The problem is we want a cool well designed base. But we cant blueprint it really.. its to buggy. I have a blueprint made of tents and its awesome for a quick plop and go. But I also want a well designed home to call my own. I agree. We need two budgets.
---
*waste
---
EXCEPT that AIM DOWN SIGHTS sometimes fucking STICKS and that has gotten me killed 2x so I don't  use scopes for now
---
Thank god we can put this to bed finally
---
Tag screws, springs, plastic, steel, aluminum, lead and gold for search. You'll thank me later.
---
Always bulk Aluminum and Lead. . . You'll thank me later ; ) . But seriously, bulking these items can save loads of stash space.
---
Don't buy from robot vendors (Unless you absolutely have to), only sell your unneeded materials/items/chems etc. . .
---
Unlock Super Duper as soon as you hit lvl 50 if you can. 30% chance at getting a duplicate crafted item//food/drink etc. . .
---
Run like hell from Scorchbeasts until you have end game gear, lol. I'm serious. Don't just stand there. Run! Unless of course there are high lvl players around, then I guess just survive while getting in a few shots, and reap the free xp.
---
That could work as the adventure mode:
---
1 perk point per level
---
1 extra random pack after 5 levels.
---
If you have a team to play with. Im low level so if there is a lvl 60 player or above at a location, that location spawns high level enemies. Too high for me. So usually i leave and come back when no other player is there. 
---
Still, I get my butt kicked in solo, but this game was made for teams it seems.
---
Facebook.... 4chan's alter ego
---
The worst thing is that after level 15 you don't get them everytime you level up anymore. And they can still be duplicates...
---
I got a perk card yesterday, it's level 9 Agility so I an't use it yet... but it's JUMP HEIGHT PLUS 300 percent! WTF --- makes me wonder what other nutty cards are out there. I can't wait to respec and try this card
---
I just recently started using sneak more. It's really op. Lol. Just casually crouch walk up to everything. 
---
Super mutants literally staring right at you saying "huh, what was that?!?"
---
I will say this tho, mirelurk queens, kings, and hunters are my worse nightmare. Their acid spit is totally op. Just melts me every time.
---
I can't recall the last time I saw a server crash in the game and I am present for back-to-back-to-back nuke drops on the queen with some regularity. Does the FPS crap out during some of those encounters? Yep. But we the world stays intact and we go about our business. 
---
What you are actually trying to do is adjudicate past issues that have already been rectified in attempt to leverage them against the current iteration of the game. While I dont have any faith in you seeing the follies of that type of logic, it appears that based on your up vote/down vote ratio that others are picking up what you are putting down and aren't buying it either. 
---
Go eat a snickers.
---
Agreed on the hazmat suit. Scout armor is kind of bright! Marine armor blends well though
---
my gamertag is cmccoy6 next time I am available and online I will add you and you can stop by, this weekend I won't be home, today I am finishing packing, and a part of next week I will still be up where he lives, when I come home I will definitely let you know. Seems like a lot of people want to have a 21 gun salute in game for him, this won't be until after I return home, unfortunately.
---
What’s it called?
---
Cloth is not useless neither is cork. 1 is used with acid to make gunpowder and the other one for fixing and crafting ultra light armor. Glass is useful for camps stuff but if you have a simple camp then you won't need that much glass.
---
Not if it's an Atomic Shop item.
---
It was in the atom shop - you just had to login everyday over Easter and get the eggs. 
---
Unfortunately I missed one day due to the atom shop loading bug (never again) and never got the first egg.
---
Damn, my most is 12.
---
Yeah man I'm just gonna put a load of NSFW/NSFL images in my Fallout Photo's Folder for everyone to enjoy! /s
---
Sadly this would be to easy to abuse.
---
How do you do that?
---
How about that Pro Snap Camera that refuses to go away... I mean I’ve dropped it literally 50+ times, yet no matter what, it’s always back in the inventory when I log on the next day. 
---
Be nice if that was Sentinel Armor, but oh hell noooooooo.
---
You could try server hoping. Many times the enemies will recalibrate according to your level. That's if a higher level is not in the same area. Otherwise high level enemies will continue to spawn.
---
I can do all that but I choke in the final circle. 
---
Thats where the real gunmen show their skills.
---
Hell yes! That or something akin to the ESO 'guild' system instead 'Faction' same concept like ESO though.
---
How is it convenient to use Purified Water (which requires time and/or resources, and has a base value of 20 caps and can sell to a vendor for up to 5 caps) instead of Dirty Water, which you can get for free, and about 200 in the space of about a 60 seconds?
---
I will play Adventure again after I get a few more Overseer levels. 
---
Going back there for sure because I love Adventure mode, but I am playing all the BR I can ATM just in case it goes away in a few days.
---
If it were made permanent, I would spend a lot more time in Adventure.
---
Just do everything in the forest to start out, loot every container, visit every building. If you are likely to always play together, spread your bases out to minimise fast travel costs &amp; utilise vault 76 for free travel as well.
---
What lvl are you?  Game opened up for me around lvl 50 with what a decent melee rifle build.  That’s when I could first stand up to a scorched beast.
---
Won't happen: you can dump any image in your folder and it will show up as loading screen. Even with as good as this community is, you'd be having people get goatse'd on day one. No way they'd allow that.
---
Sometimes heavy Facebook users are very slow to catch up.
---
And holy shit, all I did was make a joke because I’ve seen a bunch of people ask for it. Fuck watch me downvote every suggestion everyone makes from now on. Fuck me man resistors are the biggest bipolar fucks I’ve ever seen in my life.
---
If I can have a camp.. and then take control of 5 workshops on my own.. certainly the servers can handle this. There has to be a way. Maybe make workshops budget decrease or the camp budget decrease since its for quick plop downs and not big builds. There has to be a way to balance this imo.
---
Keep “aiming” the camera next time till you see the name appear. Never take a photo unless you can see the name
---
Capture workshops and do the defend events.  You earn caps, exp, meds, plans, and sometimes weapons and armor.  You can also set up extractors and get free materials. 
---
Make sure you level up your weapons and armor.  A level 1 hunting rifle is noticeably less effective than a level 10 hunting rifle.
---
If you are out exploring and the enemies are too tough go back and grind some levels.  Fighting high level monsters when you aren't ready is a waste of stimpacks, ammo, and item durability.
---
Explore the world and have fun!  The game is so much more fun with friends!  Good luck out there!
---
The flamey skins are behind the overseer ranks, but the actual armors are unknown atm, I really hope Bethesda doesn’t lock them up after the NW mode, some of us don’t really care about it.
---
Im only lvl 16 rn...slowly collecting caps and even more slowly doing quests
---
I agree with your opinion, this is very difficult and I try to stay happy about it sometimes I'm okay and sometimes I am not. He left a lot of memories and information with me and I am forever grateful. Thank you again for your kind words I really appreciate it!
---
I'm not a fan of NW at all, but I appreciate that other people really like it, and if it brings more players in that's more revenue for BGS to work with, which will make other content better and or faster for us.
---
You might have gotten it in a perk pack since it's only a rank 1 perk card it won't show up to pick when you rank up if you already have it
---
If it's ini related, try to delete or remove your inis from your folder and start up the game.
---
It will create a vanilla version of the inis missing.
---
I recommend tweaking ini entries one at a time, so you immediately see if something went wrong.
---
Also be careful with older ini tweak guides! 
---
Vanilla inis have changed over time as well as in-game settings and they most likely will change in the future.
---
I hope this helps!
---
Good Luck!
---
I think the lore is to keep people invested in story who normally play Adventure playing Nuclear Winter, just like the need to level up your Adventure character for SPECIAL in Nuclear Winter is meant to get Battle Royale fans to play the story. Try and expose people to different things and give it all a try you know?
---
That sucks since one of my friends also had the same issue, however I'm talking about if you actually got them all the Mascot head wouldn't even show up in the atom shop at all, not even classified a owned or anything, it only appears in your armour workbench for some reason
---
Oh, so that’s what I’ve been doing wrong all this time..
---
Only if you die due to radiation damage.  If you just get shot, that seems kind of cheap.
---
Facebook is the backwash of the Internet. Don’t take anything you see there too seriously.
---
I managed to listen to my first tape last night.    Zax was talking to "Candidate Chambers"  Seemed like the tape was like 2:15 secs long so i missed out on ending but also missed out on alot of the talking cause all i could hear was Punching noises and Screams.     Hope to god they add the Area into Adventure Mode So you can go in and explore it.
---
See my edit .
---
This could be fun. Then after the last person survives,  make it a horde mode for a bonus to see how many of us he can kill before dying for a bonus reward.
---
I bought it solely to play with my brother, after constant disconnects the first few days I gave up. The 16x detail is just one of the many lies this ass told us, turns out it was practically the same game, the same crap engine from FO4. I love the FO lore and enjoyed the FO series, but Fo76 was nothing new and pretty much another cash grab sold on the FO popularity. People should have abandoned this game and forced Bethesda to do better, but since they got their pass, there is little reason for them to do that anymore.
---
I have moved things about and got to this now, which includes class freak as well. Thank you for your help.

I'm not a survivor player but that shotgun tempts me... any tips for the Brahim? Do you have to be sneaky or you have only to find a not milked Brahmin?
---
Now you fellas can't complain that you don't want our characters wiped. It would be a new mode. Happy :P?
---
Let’s have a Ping system instead of VATS. We don’t even need to VATS monsters in NW, they run straight at you.
---
Thank you so much for your comment, I appreciate it. I wish cross-play was a thing but for now, it isn't I wish you a good time in Appalachia as well!
---
Yea based on how the main quest ended, it seems like they just wanted it to be a big surprise plot twist
---
I won a match with a scoped 44.
---
I just say to let them have there little temper tantrums. Game will go on despite the haters. 
---
I believe they are more upset because the game is getting so popular. 
---
Wait till Wastlanders launches, they will be foaming in the mouth mad.
---
You can just replace a Brahmin pen a bunch of times too - no server hopping required
---
Okay then thank you,
---
I think I have got to this now haha: [Build Link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d634e5b&amp;d=sq1s30sr0s22cu0ip2ls2l71lt2ic4s12id2cm2a00sb2p10s72sg2eh2pg0ph0pi0pa0p80a80lu2&amp;w=pe2cr0i71im1in1iq2lm2at1ii0if2p70i10a70c12c72c52&amp;n=Heavy%20Energy%20Gun%20Build&amp;m=c29ef)
---
I'm playing on Xbox One, what do you play on?
---
Lots of newer players because of the free week which explains the lack of nukes and high level stuff happening.
---
Yes, thank you.
---
In short - NW
---
Also don't worry too much about picking the best perk cards early on.  I would however focus on one ranged build and try to pick a melee build as your backup.  Once you get to level 50 you can start to tweak your deck and perk cards a bit.  It might not be a bad idea to have separate builds from your teammates if you are all going to play together a lot.
---
I run a rifle/1h melee hybrid build.  Its solid in PVE and I can hold my own in pvp.
---
I would definitely give up one point from each tier of slugger to grab blocker, you sacrifice 15% damage to receive 45% less from melee attack, however if you’re running a bloodied build that 15% loss should still not stop you from one-shotting everything except scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens. 
---
Any time you can increase your health pool will benefit you, even in a bloodied state as it all works based on percentages. So when you are low health, you will have more hp with the ranks of lifegiver, and those few hit points can make the difference between staying in the fight or having to dip out.
---
Imagine you have 250 base hp. At 20% health, nerd rage activates so that’s typically where you want to stay. So you are running around with &lt;50 health relying on damage reduction and mitigation perks to keep you alive. With the additional 45 health from lifegiver, at 20% health that translates to an extra 9 hp, or 18% more health than you regularly have (you can take 18% more damage before dying!). That’s pretty huge. 
---
I can’t make the same argument for fireproof, it’s really a pvp centric perk 
---
You can skip barbarian completely if you’re running a 2h weapon as the defense rating isn’t worth the additional dps loss. You definitely want serendipity for any glass cannon type build, it’s your #1 survivability perk when bloodied.
---
Perks like tenderizer and suppressor are good for bosses, but not great for regular mobs as you can only apply them to one target at a time and you will be moving through regular mobs very quickly.
---
Wait, so is the hellfire PA it’s own actual Power Armor or just a customization option for like X-01?
---
It’s an evolving MO. Now that we tamed WV, people are returning. 
---
After the conflict of settlers and raiders I can’t wait to see what is next.
---
I am glad you enjoyed it! I am very sorry if it was hard to read or too blocky, I am new to Reddit and I just wanted to share this post before I have to leave for his area, all of these kind thoughts and comments help me so much. Thank you again!
---
(X) QUIT
---
(Y) RETURN TO VAULT 51
---
Please and thank you.
---
No time to go through everything right now but:
---
-when you sort aid by "spoil" it automatically sorts your apparel, and only your apparel, by spoil as well
---
-sorting by spoil doesn't work when trading with vendors. That sucks because I want to sell my food that's closest to spoiling first
---
Small issues but would be nice to have a fix
---
Toxic... Fallout... hahaha.
---
I just ignore them.  Most have never actually played the game and are spewing stuff from their ass.
---
That's not to say that 76 didn't deserve the criticism it got, but it was a little microcosm of the whole "fake news" phenomenon and how disturbingly simple it is spin up a hate train against something.  A train that keeps chugging away without any real destination.  The best thing you can do is keep your head down and press on.  Bethesda's free week has won over a lot of converts, and while not every one will go on to buy the game or think it's amazing, they will at least understand that it's not a raging dumpster fire, and anyone who continues to insist that it is will look increasingly shrill.
---
Haters gonna hate
---
I would not mind them decreasing the workshop budget tbh. Some i have seen, have literally 30 turrets, just no need for that! I would even take a hit on camp budget, in order to increase server stability. I am unsure what the best course of action is tbh.
---
Just run up to it hit E / A / Activate
---
They don’t bolt like a lot of things do unless you hurt them. 
---
Personally I think the OPs needs to read a bit more there’s tons of them around the world and you can literally spawn them yourself in camp.
---
Or getting surrounded by a team
---
I played for the first time today and I know I’m pretty bad at it. I play cod and I’m pretty good but when it comes to battle royal I’m useless. The few games I played I was in a team with a guy who was level 32 so thought I’d follow him. All 3 match’s he just ran to the middle and hid with no guns etc. I got killed and watched how he was the last player left all 3 match’s but how was we going to win when he had no weapons  and 3 players were shooting him. Guess he was just going for the points.
---
I just ended up in the Top 5 and I had not had a single kill, so either I’m lucky AF of this 50 cal ain’t working hun
---
Bethesda is notoriously bad about load times
---
Would be cool if you could at least queue up from Adventure mode and explore a little while waiting
---
Might be some technical limitations to that, though
---
I absolutely agree I wouldn't be the person I am or the person I am trying to be in life if it wasn't for him, Thank You so much!
---
I agree, some points for dealing damage.
---
The number one thing - if a high level player drops a bag for you - pick it up, please don't run the other way, you won't get griefed. A lot of people try to help out - take that help
---
Usually the case. I dont play BR often so thats why i havent won one yet.
---
White springs
---
This sounds like a cool setting, but I personally hope they have it toggleable. I'm partial to my own photos.
---
Aren't like 3 other NW maps already datamined? Atleast stuff that look like they can be another NW map. Also, I doubt that they'll take it away for some weeks and change no stuff at all.
---
Meh it happens. Sometimes you’ll be glad it activates in adventure mode.
---
Yup.
---
Do events to gain exp and just grind it out or find a high lvl player to help you
---
It will even out. Even after NW launches. 
---
Look on the bright side. More workshops to claim.
---
That aside I should say I thought I wouldn’t like it but it’s a hoot
---
Build a fertilizer producer at your camp and it comes with one cow free. I tried a bunch of server hopping and the only thing that worked was this. The cow appears instantly.
---
What's with the .44 bull barrel? It doesn't even exist in game.
---
It's fine if you don't know how to play battle royale...but if you're above level 10 or 20 and not do any of that
---
Thats an awesome idea, i'd like to join. I added you, so let me know when you're back in the wasteland!
---
I think I’ve seen the makeshift ronin helmet in one of the datamine posts. It looked like a firebreather helmet with a covered samurai like face, as well as rebreather tubes.
---
PSA: if you establish a “friend network” it’s infinitely easier and less RNG to serverhop.
---
Man, it was SO FULL. 
---
Now, it's low-level full... but that brings a whole 'nother kind of fun. I spent all night gifting stuff, teaching folks, stalking people, helping players do events... playing "mysterious stranger" for players in trouble... 
---
I hopped servers a couple times (changing characters), and every server I joined was packed.  
---
Hilariously low levels of vendor camps, but... packed.
---
This is true!
---
Thank you so much for your comment I really appreciate it, I am sorry for your loss as well and I wish you the best, you have my sincere condolences. My gamertag is cmccoy6 if I am ever online and you want to stop by I would appreciate it! Thank You again!
---
I would see them fixing all the bugs and taking alot of the feedback. To me it seems like they wouldn't have it in an area they didnt beta test, however if you say other spots were determined I could be wrong cause I didnt see that
---
Hopefully it doesnt need a patch before using.
---
Wait actually? can you give me a link to that Bethesda quote?
---
How does the quality compare to the old one? I’d imagine it’s better, but specifics would be lovely, if it’s no trouble.
---
also I am not sure if concentrated fire works with melee.
---
I, too, would like to see a text chat. After work I rarely want to fire up a mic on a game unless its with irl friends (Even then sometimes).
---
I would think a text chat would be justifiable in the sense that everyone has pipboys. They could perhaps limit the radius it transmits, similar to voice, but even a "global" could be fun at times. Assume it was either a technical limitation or intended to keep the feeling of isolation?
---
Thank you so much, the pond I am referring to is the one that has the swing in the tree, just like he had so many years ago this location was eerily similar to what he described to me as his home when he was a child. Again Thank You so much!
---
If you really want to keep Gunsmith, perhaps use rank 3 of Gunsmith, so you can run your Heavy Gunner perks at rank 2, and keep your Strength at 15.  If you decide you can manage without Gunsmith at all, then you can always use First Aid 3 in place of Gunsmith 3...  First Aid really does give a nice boost.
---
If you plan on it being a Bloodied PA build later on, then you can swap in Nerd Rage 3 or move the 3 points to Agility (Dodgy) or Luck (Serendipity), make sure you have Emergency Protocols on your PA.
---
The Facebook comments (on everything) are toxic
---
&gt;37 comments
---
I just want to say that all of you at Bethesda never cease to amaze me. Every thread I check out you're in the comments somewhere talking with us and I truly think that is the coolest thing and I appreciate it so much. Thank you!
---
Try this map level range I found a while back .....................
---
 [https://cdn.gearnuke.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-zone-map-level-range.png](https://cdn.gearnuke.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-zone-map-level-range.png) 
---
Hope it helps ya amigo :)
---
It's not just the area. If a high level player is there before you and spawns in a bunch of high level enemy's they don't change just because you come along.
---
I've noticed the exact same on Facebook, Twitter is almost as bad too
---
like 66% off for a "physical" copy from the right vendor
---
I remember doing the tagging thing in FO4 but it never even crossed my mind here. I saw that you can bulk materials but I didn't know to what benefit it was. Thanks for the advice, it's much appreciated.
---
I tried recently to milk mi CAMP brahmin but it didn't work, I have to try again
---
I don't think it's that explosive wouldn't add damage, it's just that you can't get them anymore. Would be interesting to compare a F+25% .50 cal and GP.
---
Minor? point 1 is minor.  
---
Someone mentioned to check field of dept setting to fix how the game look, so it might fix point 2.  
---
Server lag with only 8-10 player? Minor? Maybe the free trial increased the influx of players and the servers are having a hard time, but it's still not minor.  
---
encountering bug within 2 hours of gameplay that I also saw happening in videos when the game was released isn't a good sign.  This isn't some indie 2-3 dev game. This is supposed to be AAA.  
---
Must be a bad luck, since it's not occurring for anyone but me...
---
Thank you so much, my gamertag is cmccoy6 anytime I am online, which won't be until sometime next week, I will be on and exploring the wasteland all over again! Thank You!
---
😀 Never milk another man's Brahmin. 😀
---
I;m all for it.
---
No legendary gear.
---
No "omniscient map". You want to be a vendor? Then find a location that gives you good visibility.. but with that, comes increased risk.
---
Diseases that hit harder.
---
Addictions that hit harder.
---
LOCKED perks... no more of this "I can do anything" crap. Pick your build... and go. Respec when you hit level 50, and then every 50 after.
---
and so on.
---
Oh yea, that's a good idea, thanks.
---
I came back yesterday after a month or so break. Finding the damn tourist for the camera and doing the backpack quest is making me wanna pull my freaking hair out.
---
But still having a blast.
---
I live in venezuela, my salary is 11 dollars per month :C
---
Thank you 😊
---
Its not a quote. He's referring to the free play week and challenging people to actually go try the game.
---
1. Honestly, it's the lighting.  No matter how much time you spend on your character's face, if you ever have a situation where you have a top-down light, it looks bizarre.  You can try it for yourself if you have a CAMP and stand directly under a light fixture, as opposed to beside it.
---
2. I believe you can turn down the depth of field, but that's just how it is.
---
3. Lag is noticeably worse this week for pretty much everyone because I'm sure the game is being stressed out like it has never been before.  It was pretty stable prior to this week and I expect it to be relatively normal next week.
---
4. It's a Bethesda game.  It happens.  That particular thing doesn't happen very often though.  I might see it once or twice a week.
---
Here are a few from the last week. 
---
I was hoping the overseer's chair would include the desk as well.
---
Thanks for the tips, we appreciate it.
---
They don't give extra damage, I have several explosive energy weapons and they do exactly the same damage as without
---
https://i.imgur.com/kLoq1Q9.jpg
---
Best I can do is some meat shields
---
I feel like I see this thread in any BR I’ve ever played.  
---
Here’s how I’d handle scoring:
---
• Killshots are worth 25 XP.
---
• Assists are worth 15 XP.
---
• Wins add a flat percentage modifier to all other XP sources combined, such as 25%.
---
• Survival Time functions as it does now.
---
So let’s say you’re playing a round, and you win.  You get 3 killshots and 4 assists.  The round is 15 minutes long.
---
I don’t have the numbers for duration, but let’s say it’s [200XP for surviving that long + (3 x 25 = 75) + (4 x 15 = 60)] x 1.25 (the win) = 419 XP.
---
I’m pulling some of that from my ass, but tweak the numbers to compensate.  
---
Additional wins should have a chance (not guaranteed) to reward an exclusive cosmetic from a larger pool of winners cosmetics that can be used in NW and other modes.
---
Im not saying they arent "packed". Im more curious why I havent seen a nuke go off in a while but the free week contributes quite a lot to this lol
---
Bottled water....seriously just purified water lol. My character is thirst AF. Shoutout to leadbelly at least

---
Thank you so much, my gamertag is cmccoy6 I won't be on until sometime next week after all of this is concluded but when I am I will let you now! Thank You again!
---
On PC, maybe, but things are more secure on console - we can't just add images in to games.
---
Even on PC, the game presumably knows which shots were taken in game. Can you already just put any photos in to a folder and have them appear in game then?
---
And I know for a fact you're wrong. A headshot with the hunting rifle will leave a full hp target in scout armor with a sliver of health. The only two its going to knock in 1 head shot is wood armor and naked. Come at me with some more dumb bullshit and I'll keep telling you that you're wrong.
---
Lag?
---
That would be perfect!
---
At the moment I'm binging on NW because it will run out in a few days. I'll be back to Adventure soon. When NW comes back as a regular mode I'll try and ration myself a little.
---
I have heard about this, and it's good, I have given up on games because of toxic playerbases before so I'm chuffed that this one seems helpful and friendly thus far, in and out of game.
---
How do you know. Curious
---
Thanks be to Todd
---
Whenever you see a Horde event pop up, try completing them! They always spawn a 3* legendary enemy (ranging from about level 15 to level 65), which can drop a chameleon piece for ya.
---
Once you're close to level 40, the "Uranium Fever" event is a nice place to get legendary items as it spawns 3 legendary enemies!
---
I was skeptical at first, but I'm happy with the Atom Shop.  That's right!  CRUCIFY ME!

I think about it this way.  I do get a paltry amount of free caps from challenges.  I can purchase things once in a blue moon, especially if they go on sale.  I'm provided an path to play the game 100% free after the initial purchase and still get unique items from the Atom Shop.  But I do drop $10 maybe every other month when a neat item/skin is released, especially the costly limited time ones like the Four Horseman Power Armor Skins(I had to have War; It looks like a mecha.)  And when I do spend that money, I get new content on top of all the free content released regularly and stuff that I purchase with freely-earned caps.  As long as the game is growing, I'm happy to spend a little more money on it.
---
I still hate the idea of Repair Kits, though, and drop/destroy them whenever they pop up in my inventory and weigh me down.
---
Agreed, but it's new and most hardcore players have nothing left to do but work on bugged world challenges for possum badges. I've spent a good bit of time in NW also. The only time I'm not there is when I don't have three other people to team up with.  Teaming with ransoms in NW has not gone so well for me.
---
Yeah I'm a fat bastard and I could can run further than my character in NW LOL ;)
---
Thank you so much, my gamertag is cmccoy6 I won't be on until sometime next week after all of this business with him is concluded. When I come back I will let you know. Thank you!
---
Cool, thanks for the links.
---
That would be awsome.
---
I do all of that, except use grenades. Have not done battle royal yet. Lv 129, rifle build. 630-1000+ a shot. About a 90% shot accuracy. I play to win.
---
As far as I'm aware the current week long trial is actually the full game
---
Oooohhh....... but I still doubt they’re going to be people who will still not try it out because they want to be able to prove their own points.
---
Yet, you can afford a PC &amp; internet? I'm not buying your bullshit.
---
Welcome...   to BATTLE ROYALE
---
Lol but yeah, that shit’s annoying
---
If only they did some sort of free trial so people could see for themselves instead of making more of these posts.
---
Yeah but now adventure mode in lonely for everyone over level 15
---
On the bright side they are buying up modern painting, and domestic table plans faster than I can load them in machines.
---
One tip I have is for a good little boost to xp gain. In Morgantown the "Feed The People" event appears quite often and is easy. When you complete it you get soup with gives 10% more xp.
---
&gt;-If you down a player, jump back into the shadows, move away but keep your sights on them. More times than not, their teammates will come to their aid, and that’s when you snag another kill/down.
---
***MERYL!***
---
"Snake, you'll have to go back to the armory and retrieve the PSG-1 if you want to stand any chance against that sniper."
---
Thank you for your comment I enjoy your part about the stack of bibles and that song lol that was a song that always reminded me of him and I was glad to see it remade for this game Thank You again!
---
Yeah only had one person in my shop all week :(
---
We'll look out for that, thanks.
---
I get it, its head cannon because it's a dream :D
---
Thanks, this was really helpful. I was asking from the perspective of a new low-level player using the Knuckles. They have the same base damage as the Combat Knife but as slower, which doesn't seem balanced at all. It's good to hear more advanced Punching weapons are better, but I'm sad about the knuckles being weak since they're one of my favourite weapons.
---
Survival mode is desolate - Adventure mode has tons of babies.  It should get a bit better once the free trial ends.
---
Yes, I've found i usually last a lot longer all by myself than with a hodgepodge of randos who rarely even have a mic on. Plus they run around grabbing everything for themselves and then dump what they don't need in the bushes. Lol. 
---
Im level 15 and ive YET to win a single round.
---
You got a bit of poo in your nostril there.
---
Unless they made the cheat, in which case they may be recording to sell it.
---
Yeah, just look at how far the game has come since launch. Things can only get better. If the game didn't die after a rocky start, there's no way it's going to now. Personally, I'm excited to see where they take it next. I've been with 76 since beta, and sure it's had some ups and downs, but it's a great game.
---
Oh that's right. Kinda forgot about the time limit.
---
The mode is so much different when you're on a team with mics, than with 3 other randos
---
I was asking about the Knuckles specifically since they don't seem balanced properly. Both the Knuckles and Combat Knife seem to have the same base damage the Combat Knife swings faster and has more perks to increase the damage. Makes the Knuckles feel pretty useless, which is a shame.
---
Sprinting isn't really that necessary in NW. The firestorm doesn't move that quickly and you can easily out jog it. If you're sprinting towards the middle of the circle as soon as it appears then all you're really doing is turning yourself into a target.
---
That being said; if you manage to please the RNG gods and get the Action Boy/Girl (+40% AP refresh) along with Marathoner (sprinting costs 40% less AP) then you'll be able to run everywhere like a complete madman. That's how my character is set up, but it doesn't really provide an advantage besides running away from a full team right at the start of the match. Or causing some confusion during a multi-team shoot out.
---
Are you low level? I know my main (above 50) always has matching points at least.
---
Thank you for your comment, Yes apparently a fake 21 gun salute is going to occur when I return home i am very excited for this although I don't know where and how to begin setting it up, I have quite a few players who are willing to participate, so far we are going with black powder rifles and then after that part anything you have like Gatling Guns or Miniguns, etc. seems like a good idea to me Thank You again!
---
I’ve noticed most issues like this and the recent mods/hacks posted in NW mode are on PC.
---
I don't mind the repair kits from the Queen battle, they are handy to have.  I don't mind the idea of kits, just the fact you can purchase them in the Atom shop.  That was a shit decision of Bethesda.
---
FYI, If you are maxxed on your  CAMP in adventure mode, but still want to build stuff to blueprint- take a workshop, then you can build anything you want to blueprint!
---
Spoiled meat is still meat...
---
Facebook ...
---
melee is pretty op..
---
[I ended up going with non auto rifles and a little bit of melee for backup](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c445bd&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72a81lb0lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71pe0ao0&amp;w=p80p90c52i30ia0ij2i42iq2at1lm2pa0p00ar0&amp;n=&amp;m=8c)
---
Im still hunting down legendary gear for it.. then I will make final perk and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tweaks as needed...
---
I am sorry to hear about the loss of your grandma, I use to sing some of the songs from the games as well and they would wonder where I heard them from, they always had a record player with the same records but seem to have forgotten about it. Thank You again!
---
11. But don't stick together too closely. I was in a team and the other three were walking around like they were joined at the hip. I was saying 'You're a big target. You're all going to die.' And they did. Very quickly. One grenade got them all.
---
My son just said he spawned in and a guy with a gun killed him!!!
---
Thank you.  Guess it’s worth giving them one more chance.
---
Aaaah yes, the classic mute stalker. I usually do that to newbies in the mole mascot outfit.
---
Hot damn, I ask a question and you actually link me to a build.
---
You, you are the type of person we need. Thank you!
---
I have a two handed bloodied melee and a bloodied crit rifle build that I currently play on and I decimate stuff with ease on both characters.  Different play styles for sure, but I don't see any negatives.
---
Positive note... it gives new players a chance to explore more and farm materials that may not be there due to more players. Also events that pop up!
---
Say what you will about Bethesda but their community managers are a treasure and deserve all the praise they can get.
---
Right.  Now you can actually challenge them with that.  It's kind of a put-up-or-shut-up move.
---
Some never will.  They'll insist on using that classic toddler logic - "I HATE THIS FOOD!"  Well did you even try it?  "NO!" - but while you may never convince them, everyone else can see how they are acting like a toddler.
---
That's one of the reasons why I ended up buying 76 in the first place.  Like it or not, I want to at least try this dish before I start spouting off about it.  And it ended up being this immensely tasty thing that I order every day now.
---
X01 paint yeeup
---
Yes the challenge is bugged across the board
---
   XBONE here. I'm getting quite a few stutters  ( game freezes for 2-5 seconds), disconnects, but only 1 crash out of game.
---
   I'm putting it down to heavier server load. New players are great, but needs to be accompanied by increased server capacity.
---
Just be glad you cant make your character a child because I would've noped tf out.
---
I run a two handed melee build, and have STR maxed out, along with all the slugger 3 perks, incisor 3, and martial artist 3 perks. Additionally, I have bloody mess 3. My damage for my best melee weapons is in the 300s. If you did a bloodied/unyielding build, you could get way higher I imagine. Also to me, it's so much less resource intensive to fix broken melee weapons. But I also keep a side arm to get tags on the Scorchbeast Queen, and other legendary enemies. With melee, I'll never need ammo, and it's not difficult to take down entire mobs.
---
NW is brand new and exciting.  It will die down soon enough.
---
  Also the main reason no one's been at your shop is the servers are flooded with level 1-5 players.  They don't know, aren't interested, and or don't have the credits to shop.  All the high level store hoppers are spread out over many servers now.
---
I use a 308 caliber light machine gun along with my Gatling plasma and together they both seem to work well.
---
Melee can put down a lot of damage while not needed to make ammo. It becomes a little less fun in my personal opinion but it’s not hard to balance both. I have most of my strength cards (lvl 15) dedicated to melee while I have 9 rifleman cards equipped in perception.. find what you like! But it’s always nice to have a melee for a backup even if it doesn’t suit your play style.
---
Agreed.
---
sounds like you might want to try not being a scrub
---
None of that would matter in NW. You only do base weapon dmg (40-150), depending on what you find, and no VATS.
---
Can I have a Gunsmith 5 as well as a Gunsmith 3 if I want to make weapons, or are tier 4 and 5 weapons not worth crafting?
---
What is Bloodied? and is Emergency Protocols a mod for PA?
---
Also are the different power armours better than each other or just visual difference? sorry to sound really noobie
---
Oh wow that would be amazing. I like that idea more than the one I said lol
---
I wouldn't say that either are superiour. When people say it is it's like the whole ford vs Chevy thing its mostly a preference. 
---
However both are good at different things and you'll have to spec your build for what you want it to do.
---
Guns are much more complicated than melee in that there are more perk cards that do specific things. But you also run into ammo being a pain. You'll be using it in droves if you shoot 5.56 for example.
---
Melee doesnt have that issue at all and is fairly simple to build in. Just pick your favorite and go. The most popular is probably unarmed with two handed following closely behind. 
---
But though its simpler you have no range at all.
---
You could do a hybrid. And it does work (dont let people tell you it doesn't) but youll never fully reach the max in either category if you try and do that.
---
Ur prices might br unrealistic. Try lowering them. I sold a ***pump shotgun for 6500 yesterday, but it was a truly perfect gun... kinda pissed me off that someone bought it. But typically peeps won't buy shit unless they think they can either resell it, trade for scrip, actually use it, or are so curious about what it might be like they can't help themselves... price accordingly. They also always think they'll find something better at another store, so discount a bit and you'll rope em in
---
Both can be very good if you upgrade them. I wouldn't really worry about it. Instead I would think about what kind of character do you wanna play. Do you want to play a gunman, melee dude, or perhaps something else?
---
I am building a character that is specialized in explosive weapons. Not because it is the best, but because I just like playing as an explosive expert.
---
Yes, especially event items.
---
im no min/max expert.. that is just where my build sits at the moment..
---
as I said.. once i get the legendary armor and weapons settled I will make final tweaks to the perks and move S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points if I need to max my potential..
---
I have a two handed , power armor wearing, tank build. 18 STR, 16 END, 15 AGL.
---
With my best weapon, a 3\* legendary Super Sledge, I am doing around 1,500 DMG per hit. I am level 135.
---
I never have to worry about ammo. My weapons are cheap to repair. I very rarely die because of my tank build. I love my character build.
---
How can people cheat?
---
GP is easier on ammo (especially when both are primed), 50Cal has highest damage potential with the right legendary effects on it.   You can't get armor penetration unless you have a legacy explosive energy weapon.  Even running Stabilized does nothing more than increase your accuracy.  Because anti armor doesn't reduce energy resistance the GP is always outclassed damage-wise by the 50cal.
---
They've been quite active this week, but they usually don't comment quite this much (then again, there is rarely so much to comment on)
---
I'm curious about what cosmetics and decorations you've gotten?
---
To clarify, I love the br and want to see it do well so I suggest improvements that could benefit the mode.
---
That’s my biggest complaint from the free trial. I am loving the game but the pc interface is nonsensical at times
---
Yep. If anyone you damaged within the last 45 seconds dies, you should get credit for that kill. But damage should also be rewarding XP.
---
I don’t mind stuff like the dmv quest, as long as it works and major bugs don’t make it more challenging than it needed to be.
---
I had quit because they broke hunger and thirst with a release after we had suffered through several patches with what felt like more breaks than fixes.
---
I'm aware lol
---
I am not the poster, I have no opinion one way or the other and I play on Xbox lmao, I was just explaining loadout
---
I appreciate the link, thank you
---
I'm willing to bet that there will be some raider themed content coming to the store this fall. Maybe then?
---
depends in my opinion
---
first of all if your planning to do pvp i wont be much of help because i only do pve stuff
---
for pve you can say both melee and ranged weapons are absolutely viable if you are having a decent build
---
the only real difference is that guns need way more maintenance and probably way you down a lot mor due to ammo and weapon reduction perks not beeing available for rifles
---
however you decide you should be able to play the game without a problem its not like you can make a choice thats obviously wrong 
---
there are a few weapons that are trash but thats it
---
There are way more players in adventure mode atm, problem being they are lvl 1-10.  Not much going on in those levels besides banging out the starter quests.
---
Yess take those workshops and hold all that junk in your inventory, so I can shoot all the guys out of your brain for that FREEE junk.
---
Vertibots.
---
oh. i havent clicked the link. thank you anyways:)
---
what we need is a text chat son... not emojis...
---
I already own the game.  Free trial is pointless to me.
---
It's actually pretty simliar to what I was thinking. Max out 1 handed melee and rifles, so if you say it's viable I'm cool with it. I've never been a min/max person, I like to dabble in different things and have fun.
---
Free trial. Try it
---
Usually when people invite you to a team from across the map, they're just trying to get a free fast travel. I often oblige &amp; then just remove myself from the team a min or 2 later.
---
Collect the Bloodleaf you find growing next to water and Soot flowers (growing all over the Forest). You can make a healing salve out of them which is useful if your low on Stimpacs.
---
Sleeping in a bed will give you passive healing (but if you sleep on anything but a proper bed, you're likely to get a disease).
---
Take over any unclaimed Public Workshop you come across then Defend it against one attack (these Defend missions usually trigger a few minutes after you claim a Workbench). You get lots of good rewards for both. But don't bother holding onto it after that, they're not that much use and you lose them when you leave the game.
---
Once you start getting into Legendary effects, some of the weaker weapons can still shine.  I ran around with an Instigating Boxing Glove, for example.  It's a jokey weapon, but I could nevertheless one punch a lot of things at my level.  I'm pretty confident some Instigating Knuckles would be comparably powerful.  You're just not likely to use them against a Lv. 68 Super Mutant.
---
They are not true, this game isnt going to go F2P
---
I realize you're not the OP. But your last sentence made it seem like you were unsure as to the OP's point. I only meant to clarify.
---
You got a link for that thread by chance?
---
I recommend close to the center of the map, using it as a central fast travel hub reduces your cap travel expenses, and as an added bonus the the savage divide has great views.
---
Then maybe just read one of the thousand other posts asking the same question.
---
I was under the impression all Vertibots were operated by automated systems, and I don’t think the Brotherhood in Appalachia used any Vertibirds, let alone reprogram Vertibots.
---
Yes - you can - just takes more cards/levels.  For energy weapons, you don't even need Gunsmith though.  I have a Gunsmith 5 (crafting only) and a Gunsmith 1 (mixed in sometimes.
---
Try to pick an area close to water, and if you can find a spot with a resource node, that's a good bonus. 
---
Put it a good distance from vault 76 so you have 2 good, free fast travel points.
---
Choose a spot with a nice view.
---
Like DoorDash or GrunHub but ... you know ... backwards.
---
Sounds reasonable enough, thanks again.
---
Well, part meat, part deadly bacteria 🦠
---
You clearly want to be in /r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
You should go share your opinion there.
---
What system??
---
T.E.N.T. - Tactical Exploration Node (Temporary)
---
You can set it up at any valid spot (i.e., if you could place a C.A.M.P. there), and it has a smaller radius (about 1/3 of a normal C.A.M.P.), with about 10% of a normal C.A.M.P.’s budget. 
---
When you logout, the blueprint is automatically saved, but unlike your C.A.M.P., it won’t stay between sessions. You redeploy it during your next session, wherever you’d like. 
---
Caps cost to deploy is low and static (like, always about 10 caps, maybe), and acts like a free travel waypoint as well. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Unfortunately it's against walmarts policy to price match even with their own website or even another store, some still do because for a long time it was the way and some just never confirmed to the new rules, I think perhaps branch managers have the right to decide to do it or not still possibly. So the receipt wouldn't do him any good.
---
I listened to the suggestion to go to the golf course, Much regret when I was swarmed by 10 60+ ghouls
---
Bulking iirc only (weirdly) saves space for Aluminum and Lead, but it also serves a purpose for selling bulk materials of any kind, + imo it makes for a much cleaner stash inventory w/ less clutter to sort through. You're welcome.
---
&gt; When people say it is it's like the whole ford vs Chevy thing its mostly a preference.
---
I appreciate everything you said except for this long. As a mechanic I can tell you that Ford is by far the worst of the two ;)
---
I was thinking a .308 bolt action and a melee wepaon or something, but thank you, I'll try both of them and see what I like better!
---
I'm trying both.
---
I have a level 13 rifleman who uses a hunting rifle with a .44 revolver as backup. I'm working toward a stealthy sniper build with him.
---
Also have a level 8 working toward a melee build. I'm going to give her both one and two-handed melee perks. She just found a fire axe and her first shotgun. Seems like a shotgun might be a good backup weapon for a melee fighter.
---
Both builds are doing fine in the game so far. You just have to adjust your combat tactics.
---
Im going to start lowering all prices again. There's a balance between selling out and and having to go get more, vs. Selling just enough to make $ but not have to constantly resupply.
---
You also get skins for guns, craftables, and armour. There's actually a few skins for power armour.
---
Nice work, I've been wondering a few things about furious modifiers, if you happen to know the answer. 
---
How does furious work with shotguns? Is it number of pellets landed or pulls of trigger?
---
Do you know how long between shots before the furious multiplyer falls off?
---
Lol "gooder" that's what rads does to you
---
I like this idea. Balancing could be challenging.  Teammate dies but still can contribute might create some hassles for living players.  Zombies that only melee but similar speed as a normal character is of course my first thought.  But where they spawn is critical as well. If they immediately spawn where their body was, well that can be super annoying in a multitude of ways.  I think randomly spawning 50 to 100 meters away from your dead body would be proper.  And maybe have it limited to where zombies cannot spawn in after the 2nd closure of the storm since at this point, battle should be more focused between living players. Can further this by having Zombies not enter the 3rd or 4th circle and they burn up in the storm.  That could actually be fun haha.  But this still gives players who died quickly some more play time or time to benefit teammates (i guess zombies instinctually know their friends?? XD)
---
I'm guessing they'll have three or four maps, gradually introduce them to maintain interest, then use them in a slow rotation.
---
I'd really like a Savage Divide map. Terrific sniper territory.
---
They might release content in FO76 tying into FO5 to try and entice players who haven't bought the new release yet.
---
They're trying to push more Atom shop purchases. It's unlikely they'll open it up to in-game items.
---
I apologize if I ever did that to you or anyone. I figure as a team I should help. Not just stand there. I don't really care about how many kills I get. I just like to see how long I can last. As a team a kill should be awarded to whoever tagged it. Not just the kill shot.
---
What do you mean by weapon reduction perks?
---
Both are viable, but you need to do different things to bring out the best in each.
---
The only build that I think many would agree is weak and problematic is Pistols.  A great build for these might exist, but I've never seen anyone running around with a Pistol outside of new Vault Dwellers.
---
i changed it around a bit. I'll take serendipity. Are legendaries considered a meater opponent like a boss for things like suppressor or tenderizer to be a factor? later on i might test the perk cards when I am high enough level.
---
Agreed!
---
Gather 21 wasteman and do a proper in game gun salute with black powder rifles for Father's day
---
They (vertibirds) are all over Watoga, surrounded by BoS corpses...no disrespect,  but have you played that far into the game?
---
I feel like it’s only a matter of time before they make QOL adjustments like this to Nuclear Winter.
---
You'll run into griefers or people trying to cheat you but if they aren't trying to kill you they're most likely being helpful. A lot of times I drop bags of stuff I'm too lazy to sell that are helpful like stimpacks or food I know is going to spoil before I need to eat it.
---
I didn't say that it was abused, i said limit the change to once only so the ability to change name wouldn't be abused.
---
No problem man! I ran a hybrid for a while. Two handed melee and lever. Worked great but I got tired of it. Good luck man!
---
Even Heavy energy weapons?, so would Gunsmith 3 reduce them breaking by a decent amount? or would it be best to just have no Gunsmith and have the First Aid?, or some Gunsmith and some first aid?
---
Ah okay then, I haven't had any legendaries or know anything about the legendaries yet, but sounds cool.
---
just keep in mind.. while it does work.. it is definitely not the meta for a rifle build..
---
its a decent enough skeleton to start with.. it can be tweaked into or farther away from the meta easily enough once you have a clearer idea of where exactly you want to end up..
---
Gunsmith is almost needed in this game, especially if you get any two shot, explosive, or both - the guns make silly fast in this game, with Gunsmith equipped you get a little more bang for your buck when you repair 🙂
---
My Dogmeat is sick, please fix...
---
10 seconds for stacks to drop off. There's no gradual dropoff; it's straight down to 0 after 10 seconds of not attacking the target. Swapping targets also reset immediately (though sometimes the first attack against target #2 gets the bonus damage, before the reset).  
---
Shotguns ... I don't know, but I know a Behemoth who will hate helping me find out :D
---
He's always been there. There are dead Vault Dwellers all over. There's another hanging up outside the Ski Lodge to the east of the Winding Path Palace (near the station). I wish there was a challenge that rewarded you for finding them all.
---
Or we had to fast travel 8 times to visit 8 different vendors to sell our shit? Lol. It kinda made it challenging, and increased the value of caps, but sooo annoying as well.
---
Pc? Mods?
---
It's a QOL perk, beyond needing it for applying high tier mods. How often do you want to repair you guns?
---
I have a couple different perk sets, where I run either 2 or 4 ☆'s at all times, depending on how much dmg I want to do.
---
I would also look at previous games from cod mw. And games like it. And use that only in the thought process of making tweaks
---
I'd say go for both - its the big fights that have the highest wear on your guns but you don't have to run it all the time.
---
What is a Brahim good for? But yea I agree on that since it is a thing for your camp
---

---
I really wish that 51 had a floor with 52 of those pods.  It would make a battle royale fit into the established Fallout lore perfectly, and be yet another example for "Why Vault-tec is a collection of sadists."
---
Yep, all minor issues, if issues at all. Server lag could be an issue on your end as its certainly not something I experience with any regularity, even on a full server. 
---
You encountered an enemy clipping through the environment? WOW. How did you manage to maintain your composure and keep playing?
---
The leveling is already much faster than adventure mode. The trick is to stay alive long and kill people
---
sorry i forgot a word there it should have said "weapon weight reduction"
---
for example if you go unarmed or melee you most likely end up picking the martial artist perfk wich gives you faster swing speed so you boost your dps significantly and this perk also reduces the weight of melee weapons you have in your inventory
---
perks that lower the weight of weapons also exist for 
---
heavy weapons
---
pistols
---
and shotguns as far as i know
---
the only guns that you cant make lighter by perks are rifles wich doesnt seem like a big problem but if you want to carry three decently modded rifles with you be prepared to have around 50 of your carryweight beeing used just for your weapons
---
(there is a legendary effect for armor that reduces weapon weight though)
---
FO76 is pretty darned forgiving, so that’s totally viable. There’s no end of info on min/max builds out there, but you can easily get through the game content with whatever strikes you as fun at the time. I have a buddy who took almost exclusively QoL perks to eliminate a lot of the survival hassles and he does fine.
---
Facebook and Instagram, both.
---
&gt;\- Players would not always kill other players on sight like in Survival mode. Forming friendships and alliances would be crucial to surviving in this much harsher version of the game.
---
Forcing to work together sounds fun. I really appreciated that in Left 4 Dead. I haven't really seen a game since that one that worked so well.
---
&gt;\- The economy would have a fresh start. This again would encourage players to interact with each other and trade
---
I'm not really bothered by the economy. I don't even know the difference with the beginning and now. But yeah, fine!
---
&gt;\- The need to explore and gather items in survival mode, would open up doors to a lot of role-playing aspects. Some players could offer bodyguard services, hitman services etc. Going out alone to gather resources will always be dangerous, no matter where you are.
---
I doubt many people would play as hitman services. It's not really happening now either. Bethesda would need to add some stuff to the game where you can apply as a hitman.
---
&gt;\- Factions like Brotherhood of Steel and Raiders would make sense
---
This will only work if Bethesda builds in some sort of official faction system. Without it, I don't see it happening (at least not on a large scale)
---
&gt;\- No crazy overpowered players with 1000000 legendaries
---
Just a matter of days until the die hard players are overpowered again.
---
&gt;\- Creating well-designed defenses or putting locks and traps would make sense, and with that lots of cards would become useful (like picklock skills, here's hoping that robbing junk from stash would be possible in this mode)
---
Giving the lockpicking and hacking skills a bit more meaning would not be bad indeed.
---
&gt;\- it could be the best pvp survival game out there
---
I'm all for having a more difficulty hardcore mode. That forces you to make difficult decisions.
---
Nah, none of my guns or armor are over 1500 caps and all my plans are 50 and under. There’s just not been many higher levelled players about, mostly under 15s.
---
Def think that’s the goal... but don’t think it’s a good practice. People want to play a br with out any lore or any story. And right now they are getting it hamfisted. Had a couple friends that are playing apex and moved to this game but are starting to get really frustrated with how long it’s taking to actually play.
---
Ahhhh so basically you want that s9 people dont friend request you?? Or for what reason
---
I finally got it after all these months : Boiled water for cooking, Purified water for dehydration.
---
Looks like it's cause you're getting dunked on by that Scorchbeast at level 29 with only a Hazmat suit on?
---
You're just being inaugurated into the fanbase. I think everyone here who stands by Beth has experienced something like this at least once.
---
That is definitely a great second choice if you don't have the cross bow or lever action rifle combo. I use those revolvers when I start out a lot.
---
Alternate post title "I want a participation trophy because my feelings are getting hurt"
---
nah it does not even see me. I tried crouching undetected and instantly when i reached the trailer i died.
---
pc no mods.
---
You guys should put this on a T shirt and make it the new company logo .
---
I just hate how much that sniper kicks, for some reason I just am able to do better with that slight break in between when it comes to the lever action.
---
It also brings players together to play in adventure mode. I was in a match the other day and the one person on my team that had a Mic, after we both died, went with me to adventure mode. I helped him work on his tadpole badge. He built a stove at my camp. I have no clue who he is, but wouldn't have met him without NW.
---
Yeah lobby is slow.
---
I also wouldnt mind an option to tweak perks and not be queued for a match.
---
Someone already grabbed the gold. 
---
Was nice of you to give them out, shame whoever got it didn’t say thanks
---
Use a Forceful stock on your explosive rifle, for the Handmade it pretty much doubles your durability.  As for Two Shots - I tend to avoid them like the plague, don't like their inaccuracy.
---
Dude your a savage thanks so much
---
Sidebar -- Show my flair -- edit -- select flair -- save.
---
Keep an eye out on player vendors too, I've seen it sold for outrageous amounts of caps.
---
the critics only hate for sport ...
---
They say that the game is bad that they give it away in stores because of its low sales.
---
I love the trial a lot. critics liars XD
---
This sub was a super small portion of the community at launch so you mostly saw fanboys on here that would defend Bethesda no matter what
---
But if we're serious here, most if not all other battle royales lack a post-death form of play, or the lore to support it.  Coming back as Fallout's equivalent to a walking corpse might actually get me interested in a battle royale game/mode.  A chance for revenge?  *Hell yes.*
---
True. Do they bear Brotherhood insignias? I agree the crash does make sense that they used one, but I initially chalked it up to an unrelated crash they decided to briefly fortify during Operation Touchdown, since you find a transmitter there during Belly Of The Beast (during which they mention being overwhelmed with Scorched, explaining the corpses), and there’s no other reference to Brotherhood vertibots or vertibirds anywhere.
---
I'll never again build a brahmin pen.
---
I played the trial twice for a few hours and have purchased the disc version, can’t wish to sink more time in to the game, it’s actually really fun!
---
I think its mainly the youngsters that were probably in grade school when fallout 3 came out.
---
Random legendaries no, you can consider them to be like regular mobs. 
---
Bosses would be things like the scorchbeast queen, the imposter sheepsquatch, and the final fight in the project paradise event. These are super beefy creatures that you’ll be fighting for minutes at a time.
---
Has anyone here ever played Conan Exiles? It’s a survival game like fo76. In that game you can pretty much build whatever you want. And have as much inventory too. If you have, what’s the difference between the two. F076 does do a lot of things better than CE but never understood the restrictions
---
Hope there will be more armor skins. No scout or marine armor in the atom shop I could find. Love if it’s camo. 
---
Or hope more than just wood, scout or marine armor will drop like the leather and combat sets.
---
Shit. Yeah I watched without sound and assumed the seizure blasts may be hitting you. That is quite odd. Sorry I can't help you man.
---
Jesus that's a massive post. Good effort (not even being sarcastic).
---
&gt; Exactly what "majority of cases" did false advertising not happen? Are you saying almost everyone got exactly what was sold to them including the canvas bag...
---
I thought we'd covered this... the ad you linked to sure does talk about the bag material, but that ad was changed during the run - and there were a number of different ads in different territories. Pretty early on the typical "final product may differ" disclaimer was added, at least to the ones I saw. Clearly people who ordered before the change have an claim to false advertising - I'm just suggesting that those who ordered after don't really have the same claim.    
---
I'm not at all claiming that the original ad wasn't false advertising (it was). Just saying that it only applies to people buying based off the earlier ad.
---
In my previous posts I'm not contesting that some people would have ordered based on false advertising, but I am contesting the legitimacy of the outrage attached to that fact.
---
&gt; some random on the internet trying to defend his precious little game on reddit doesn't mean the factual evidence is suddenly being disputed....
---
That's kinda my point... this isn't about the game.    
---
Let's assume that I concede the point and it was all false advertising all the time... that impacts your standard Vault 76 player, how? Not one iota.     
---
When people are talking about what they don't like about 76 and then bring up the bag, it suggests they're just looking for additional reasons to justify their outrage.     
---
And hey, it's fine not to like the game - but for a massive majority of the population, 'tHe BaG' is red herring.
---
I'm not sure I'm really articulating this as well as I could be...     
---
I DON'T have an issue with people who feel ripped off after getting the Power Armour Edition complaining about the bag. Nor do I have an issue with people complaining *in general* about false advertising.      
---
What I *do* have an issue with is people who didn't order that edition complaining about the bag when talking about why THEY didn't like the Fallout 76. What other people did or did not get in their fancy edition doesn't impact your experience one why or another.        
---
And that's what I mean about using the bag as fuel for an outrage fire... People don't seem to be as outraged with false advertising as they are keen to use it as a stick to whip Bethesda with because they're upset about the game.     
---
In many cases people didn't like the idea of a multiplayer fallout or a fallout without NPCs, so were happy to take any chance they could find to bash Bethesda - even if it didn't actually impact the game at all.      
---
If you hate the game, explain why you hate the game. The bag doesn't change your experience of the game, particularity if you didn't even order that edition. 
---
&gt; Ah so anyone "crying" about something that doesn't impact them isn't okay in your books? I see good to know. 
---
I'm going to repeat myself here... but it's unavoidable, because what looked like it was going to be a well thought-out post with lots of good points turns out to have been you repeating the same 'facts' over and over again while saying 'lol' a lot...    
---
Again you're acting like I don't know what false advertising is, but I never denied that it was a factor to some extent.
---
By now I've hopefully clarified that:      
---
A - I think that false advertising complain only works for those who ordered off the basis of the original ad.         
---
B - I think that an odd shaped bag probably didn't factor into the purchasing decision for most of the people buying that version.        
---
C - It's the context of the complaint that's important. Complaining about false advertising is fine. Citing it as a reason you didn't enjoy the game is bollocks.
---
&gt; So everyone living in North America who's "crying" about the Hong Kong extradition bill and way protesters are being treated even though it doesn't directly affect them whatsoever isn't okay. Got it. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
Dude, that's a pretty beneath you.     
---
(I mean... I assume. You don't seem like a dickhead. Presumptuous perhaps, and oddly and specifically condescending of people who you think might be younger than you, but not a dickhead.)    
---
Let's not compare 'vidya gymes' to an actual political crisis. 
---
&gt; What a terrible small narrow sighted person you are wow.    
---
&gt; Anything you don't like just isn't allowed hey?    
---
&gt; Thank god you're in no position of power lol.
---
Yikes. Heading well into ad hominem territory there, mate. 
---
&gt; Why do I need to provide proof I'm speaking for everyone who got the collectors edition?? When did I say I WAS lol?
---
Because you aimed that same question at me, with the assertion that if I couldn't 'prove' that I was speaking for everyone then my opinion was just 'baseless assumption'... which technically it is.       
---
But by returning the question to you, I'm just highlighting that your opinions are also baseless assumption... or in the words of someone wiser: That's just, like... your opinion man.     
---
And at least my assumptions are coming from someone who actually brought the edition in question. 
---
Can we just assume that this is a dead end point that's being argued for arguments sake, and focus on the other points above?
---
&gt; Sorry my apologies, I judged from your lack of understanding of basic consumer protection laws and illogical baseless claims that you were just some young teenager. So how have you reached 40s without even basic knowledge of how false advertising works?
---
Were you going for clever? Because it's coming off as bitchy. I'm going to quote my post from four posts back and break it down for you....
---
"Calling bollocks - not on the false advertising, but at how much oUtRaGe there should be."     
---
Here I clearly said I was calling bollocks on the outrage, NOT calling bollocks on the idea that there was some level of false advertising.
---
"They edited it pretty early on, so the number of people impacted by incorrect advertising are a minor percent."      
---
Here I was trying to suggest that whether or not false adverting was involved depended what ads you saw when buying that edition of the game.
---
"And again, most of us got the power armour addition for the power armour, not the bag the power armour was stored in."      
---
I feel this speaks for itself, although it is opinion based. You're welcome to disagree, but my opinion here has the advantage of being from someone who actually brought this version... so do with that what you will.
---
&gt; "Most of the people complaining are people who didn't buy that version, like you, looking for fuel for the outrage fire."      
---
And lastly, here me highlighting the idea that the bag material HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SODDING GAME. People bring it up not because they care about false advertising, but because they didn't like that Fallout 76 wasn't going to be a single-player focused RPG. Which is really the point that matters most to me - most of the outrage was being driven to justify a separate narrative.     
---
Again, if you don't like that game, that's fine. Hate it all you want. But the fact someone else didn't get the right bag in no way changes the game you have. 
---
&gt; I'm guessing you're from the Southern United States right?
---
Not even the right country. My use of the words 'bollocks' and 'twat' didn't clue you in?
---
I'd definitely rather have a robot or animal companion than a human.    I was always a Dogmeat and Codsworth player in FO4.
---
If given XP for being in the game even after death, I wouldn't be surprised to see players sticking around while the game plays and they go do something else.
---
Vertibirds have been more or less retconned, a little bit, already. We have two generations of Vertibirds, now: the VB-01 which is weaker and more focused on transporting troops, and the VB-02 - a vertibird with better weapons, armor, speed, cargo and so on than its predecessor - which was in prototype stage when the Great War happened (and was later finished by the Enclave).
---
[https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/fallout\_gamepedia/6/67/Vertibird\_Comparison.png?version=893af00de64b3839f9f5e29207182077](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/fallout_gamepedia/6/67/Vertibird_Comparison.png?version=893af00de64b3839f9f5e29207182077)
---
In Appalachia, vertibots - and the downed Vertibirds you see scattered around the map - are VB-01.
---
no, thats not the point. you are annoyed by the fact that other ppl got faster higher levels than you in this game and now you want more comfort. the next thing, and oh im 100% sure that this will happen once you get XP for "just damage", is that you complain, that "everyone has the hight tier items, its way to easy to earn those". i know this sounds aggressive but thats what will happen. your whole suggestion is, unfortunately, a call for comfort and an easier upleveling.   
---
BRs shouldnt be comfort at all (nor should it be easy to lvl up). the whole point of a BR is to be the last survivor, which implifies that you need at least 1 kill to win the round (except the 2nd placed player is killing himself) but the rest, you could basically just hide and/or loot. This is a what makes a battle royale a battle royal and no deathmatch where its all about kills...but hey maybe people are just used to be taken by the hand and cant deal with frustration anymore, i dunno.
---
I think that's rational.
---
Whenever the issue of companions comes up - be they dogs or humanoids - the first thing that comes to mind is how ridiculous a Scorchbeast Queen battle would be if everyone brought an AI friend.
---
Which isn't to say that I don't want a dog, but it's not as simple as "Let me bring Nick Valentine with me."
---
Thanks for the feedback!
---
As for legendaries, the title states there would be no legendaries at all in this mode, just like in the current battle royale. There will always be overpowered builds and items, but lack of legendaries will hopefully tone it down.
---
No, can’t remember where but it does state that nuclear winter will be taken down and will return later in the summer.
---
In fairness he is trying to bang a blind chick in the video
---
But only if someone sees them. If no one sees it, how can you know who is wanted?
---
And I guess the drawback from this is that I could technically take away 2 points in dodgy and throw them back on charisma for at least tenderizer for that added damage. Since % seems to be the way to go than flat damage. and with a furious legendary weapon that extra % would kick in wouldn't it?
---
I think it's down to luck, sometimes you're early, sometimes late, but you can also choose to spawn inside a building which gives you an advantage. Sometimes, I'm fully equipped in seconds (good armour, ranged weapon, melee, drugs); other times I've had to run around whimpering in fear for minutes at a time as I desperately search rooms that have already been stripped clean by my locust-like colleagues as I listen to the chatter of gunfire.
---
Ah okay then thank you again, just saw that the Gatling Laser needs Level 4 Gunsmith to craft.
---
So can have high gunsmith for crafting but keep a lower one on for normal use.
---
Something like this: [Build Link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634c5b&amp;d=sq1s31sr1s22cu0ip2ls2l71lt2ic0s12id2cm2a00sb2p10i11s72sg2eh2pg0ph0pi0pa0p80a80lu2&amp;w=pe2cr0i71im1in1iq2lm2at1ii0if2p70a70c12c72c52&amp;n=Heavy%20Energy%20Gun%20Build&amp;m=c29ef) (can't add the high gunsmith at the switch though)
---
Cool story, bro... Now you should remove this comment. You seriously just publicly displayed your ip address and remote port credentials.  It's like you want someone to hack your system.
---
Agreed! I rarely ran with humanoid companions in FO4. Dogmeat was my bro, and having him around didn't affect your ability to use Lone Wanderer, so he stuck with me through the whole game.
---
I use the sacrificial mask and clown outfit with a machete. Get right up behind them, breathing down their neck, whenever they open their pip boy, and just wait.
---
It is much easier than thinking .
---
While I hear you saying ridiculous, it sounds really amazing.
---
Not as such no. I want to be able to keep the game in game.
---
So if my display could be changed  i can do just that.
---
Nice they will visit camps. Hope someday you can have people stay at your camps to gather resources or defend.
---
I figure if I start a build and don't like it, I can restart. It's a fun game, and they keep adding stuff, so I'm not SUPER worried about it. I'll do a rifle/melee build now, then eventually make a dedicated melee and a dedicated rifle build down the road.
---
My favorite reviews showcase the *reviewer's experience* and the reviewer just trying to have fun.  That's why I like Dunkey.  That's why I made my decision to buy Fallout 76 based on CallMeKevin bullshitting around in the beta.  He was able to have fun, despite the limited beta and witnessing a few signature Bethesda bugs.
---
I can't imagine that you would. I guess you'll get a code to input. 
---
Great game. Hope you jump in.
---
Dogs are practically confirmed to happen, because we can loot dog helmets and they are placed in apparel and not scrap.
---
I can't even imagine how laggy that would be.
---
This happened to me when I was in a nuke zone. It made it easier to follow a leader. To get maximum kills/spawns. I have 15 Charisma. So I can share lvl 5 perk cards. (On my medic character that is)
---
8 legendarys isnt even much
---
the whitesprings behaves really strange over the last few weeks ( in my case at least) last week i had three days in a row were basically every time i went there i got like 20 legendarys most one stars but every time at least one or two three stars
---
this week i tend to get maybe 4 or 5 legendarys if any at all but the chance for them to be and actually drop a three star seem to be very high so
---
to sum it up
---
dont try to understand the legendary system
---
I´m on lvl 16 now and repair was/is never big issue for me. Only the mods and Weapons can be interesting for my. How much int. do you need for t5 gunsmith?
---
X1
---
I'm having very similar issues, only thing holding me back from buying the game right now.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55pboVqiIBImKOzWBDrUBp/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-patch-notes-june-10-2019
---
“Nuclear Winter Pre-Beta Sneak Peek will be available for play until June 17.”
---
And I am pretty sure that if Human NPC's arrive later this year, the game will be crowded. I think eventually even a lot of haters will start to play this game once human NPC's arrive (even now already, some haters start to like the game)
---
I shure hope so
---
There was a post sometime yesterday showing 4 maps that are roughly the size of the current NW map, one for flatwoods which we have already, one for Morgantown, one for Grafton, and one for the ash heap
---
Hey I'll chip in a few answers here. 
---
Survival mode is PvP focused, and there are restrictions on fast traveling. Not every player will attack you on sight, but you eventually get one shot. Also keep in mind that you drop all of your junk and some aid items on death in survival mode. 
---
Players in a group have instanced loot and xp sharing, so there is minimal competition withing a group.
---
Stealth sniper is a viable end game build, though it lacks the raw damage of riskier builds, such as bloodied (low health) melee builds. I hope that helps!
---
Thanks for the tip about the kits. I had no idea.
---
Was the NCR just creatively referencing suicide?
---
My CAMPs are all so "remote" that nobody has visited them all week. Heh.
---
Repair is very manageble for me, so far(lvl 16). But weapon mods with tier 5 Gunsmith can maybe game changer. Btw... i forget about Hacking! May I need high Hacking?
---
Bum bum baaaa... well yes that's around where I'm set up... im not a vendor and I've never not been able to set my camp when I sign on so i love it haha
---
I'm fairly sure they will. 
---
Remember that this is pretty much a preview of whats coming, likely to gauge our interest so they can figure out how much time/effort to put into it on top of everything else being worked on.
---
“The new human NPCs in Wastelanders won't really be wandering around outside in general, either, but will typically be stationed in instanced areas like towns, due to the multiplayer nature of Fallout 76. "Obviously, if I kill [an NPC] in the game, other people need to be able to interact with that NPC," said Gardiner. "So they will be in closed areas, frankly, and other areas where we can control the environment better than an exterior."
---
That solves the one worry I had about being multiplayer. Keeping some guy going around and either locking the dialog or killing your quest giver.
---
How do I know if it’s a horde event?
---
My friends and I are having a BLAST. (Pun intended.)
---
I did not know what could happen to me because of that image.
---
Thanks for the warning.
---
Although I feel very offended by your comment ... I hope it does not happen to you the same as my
---
Ahhhh I see
---
Build in a central location (in the Savage Divide around the Whitespring area) as it will be cost effective in fast travel.
---
And build near water for the purifiers. The Divide has a lot of unmarked water locations near and around Site Alpha.
---
[Blind Man With a Pistol -- Chester Himes](https://archive.org/details/blindmanwithpist00hime)
---
do you have chameleon gear? if not i highly suggest get at least one bit and use the perk escape artist so you can run around a corner and get into caution again
---
i have 4 chameleon pieces on me and i basically never get detected if so i usually am in caution again after a few second
---
Furious will kick in during a boss fight, generally you will want to stick to a bloodied weapon as this modifier will synergies the most with your damage reduction perks (and it also puts out the highest sustained damage of any legendary type). Bloodied weapons are the bread and butter of the glass cannon build.
---
\+10 for assist (when he/she/it dies).
---
Besides when you beat someone you should only get +5 because can rez.
---
Been thinking it since first play.
---
Ah... that would make sense considering they were on the brink of defeat until what is basically a mailman changes their fate lol
---
Knowing what verdant means isnt the issue. It's a question if how it would be expressed in actual gameplay. Until now, i just kinda thought maybe there would be more visible foliage or something. Im level 114 and i just found this out as well.
---
Use your birth suit.
---
High levels probably want to help you out. They might build things that you can’t. High levels usually have a lot of mats they don’t know what to do with. 
---
People from across the map want a fast travel. Be cool and give it to them, and just remove them  a min later. 
---
Be friendly out there - the game is a lot better when we work together.
---
It does not - all melee attack have a 95% chance to hit in vats no matter what. Concentrated fire only works on ranged weapons.
---
5 INT is the minimum you need to unlock all crafting options. PA perks are tied to it, as well as explosive dmg, and one of the best low-health build perks.
---
I would suggest a two pronged approach to all builds - pick a primary and a secondary so you're not a one trick pony.  Melee with a bit of rifles is totally viable.  For a secondary you don't have to go wild, rank 1 of the 3 damage increasing perks is all I recommend, then as you progress try to get some useful legendary weapons that helps your secondary as well.
---
I prefer Commando to Rifleman myself, but I have a Rifleman character too.  Commando to me is the best for a secondary, you often deal with mobs and semi auto rifles just doesn't always cut it.  My rifleman is a rifle primary with no secondary yet - I feel quite limited with that one character.  Will put 3 points into Heavy Guns soon so he can be half useful in large fights and Stabilized to swap in.
---
Store and replace till you can do it.
---
Honestly this part of the challenge was the easiest for me - there’s also like 4 farms that cows spawn at
---
\+1. I don't finish people for EXP. I finish them to avoid rez, contribute, win, etc. Teamplay.
---
Plasma guns are actually pretty good, especially if you do the flamer mod. Bloodied is my go-to, but Furious could also work well with said flamer mod. 
---
Lasers seem OK, not great but good. I prefer automatics for high rate of fire. Not so good for sniping as the highly visible tracer trail gives away your position immediately.
---
The BR is an excellent on-ramp to adventure mode, it’s all pretty brilliantly put together. Brand new BR players pop in to adventure mode to level up/allocate perk points and then realize how close Vault 76 is to the Overseers camp and the rest of the BR map— so they start poking around to get more familiar with the terrain outside of the murderous BR matches. At that point they are presented with multiple quests, events, items, and the whole game opens up to them. 
---
The only thing that could have made it better was if the Fasnacht Parade was running during the free trial week.
---
Thanks! That was actually what i need to know ;)
---
I wasn't going to comment but I don't see my view personally represented here, so I feel obligated. to be fair I only read the first hundred or so responses. Let me preface this by saying I love the fallout universe. All of them. I was stoked from announcement that it was coming out. Not only did I break my no preorder rule for it, but broke it twice, one copy for me and another copy for my wife. Now she really wanted the power armor edition which sold out in hours of announcement so I ended up getting one on ebay for 300 bucks. Plus my 80 dollar tricentennial edition. At this point I'm still stoked for it and can't wait for it to come out. Beta dates are released and I predownload it on my laptop as I work on the road during the week and hotel internet is sometimes lacking. 50gb download and go to log into first beta.... and games deleted. have to redownload a 50gb game on hotel internet. So I didn't get to play the first week at all. I was salty but still wanted to play. Still looking forward to it. So the next weekend finish the download again and finally get my first taste of it.... played for an hour or so fine just running around exploring having an overall good time. then the server crashed. And I couldn't get back in the rest of that session. Got to play beta one other time and it was even worse. constant lag issues, getting booted from servers still kept trying. Then the release of the actual game. another 35 gb update the day before release that it wouldn't let me download till my physical copy got there with the code on it. There's another week wasted. Plus the crappy vinyl bag that the power armor edition came with was a disappointment. Then the griefers started in. Even after release, on a game that I paid almost 400$ for two copies of my wife and I couldn't hardly play together and as I was trying even alone sometimes it just got to feel like more of a grind than anything, and that's when it would work. I have about 25 hours into it, the wife has about 5 or 10. I plan on trying it again but after all of that, I'm still just too salty about the catastrophe that was the release of this game. I'm sure it is better now. It can't possibly be as bad. but Bethesda seriously fucked up and were not in any prepared for the release of this game. Why the backlash? some of it was definitely undeserved as far as bandwagon haters goes. But I genuinely have good reason to be angry about this. And I do. I would like to give it another shot but I'm just not ready. Fuck bethesda for making me hate their shit.

I read somewhere it was disabled.

Okay. so like perhaps events? Like that grafton monster at the parade event? that might be too specific a creature to ask that about, but do events overall have a boss in it or just the ones you mentioned?
---
Nah. Nobody wants to see that.
---
Is the battle royal here to stay or is it just a free trial till Monday?
---
Hmmm goal of the game...  Fo76 doesn't have the best story line in the series... the multiplayer aspect is supposed to supplement that... but there is a main quest line... don't want to spoil it really... but I think it is worth doing to get to the "end game boss fight"
---
Beyond that more content is being added with different challenges and rewards.
---
CAMPs... build anywhere you want/ that the game will allow... certain spots and the game will say no way... expect to get player grief for building on the golf course right by whitesprings golf club... 
---
Survival will give more xp... if you are alive long enough to be earning it... 
---
In my opinion taming an enemy is one of those challenges that you do after you have done the other big stuff in game... no appreciable benefit that I found...
---
Loot is shared... not sure about the xp... think you might get a % if a team mate kills something you haven't hit at all... you will get full xp even if you just tag the enemy then your mate makes then gets the actual kill.
---
Not aware of a level cap... you just keep going, collecting perk cards or respeccing your SPECIAL stats.
---
Xp and loot.... kill stuff!!! Events and quests are best.
---
Multiple chars... don't know. Never felt the need to play it that way... unless you want 2 very different builds... melee v rifle for example.
---
THIS!
---
Which is odd seing herbivore affects spoiled fruit and veggies.
---
What kills me is I have these cards ... on my adventure stealth sniper. I gave an adventure character I play as a mad bomber. .. but cant seem to RNG those cards.
---
Username checks out
---
If my friends aren’t on, I do the same. Just hide in the bushes with the fire storm to my back. Got to the top 4 in the few games I played solo, and won one match.
---
Your able to get the outcast paint? Also where’s X-02? Vault 52 requested x-02 in one of the terminals.
---
All PA paint.
---
Eating that alive mutated flower in that event would be cool
---
Herbivore allows you to not get diseases from spoiled fruit and veggies so that seems unfair.
---
One trick is to store them, then put them back.
---
You don't find that you run out of ammo too often with autos while using commando?
---
I also thought about doing Melee + Shotgun since the shotgun damage perk is in the Strength area.
---
To be fair from a lore standpoint, Hellfire wasn't made until the enclave made it after the apocalypse.
---
So technically it doesn't exist yet. Atom shop skins technically aren't in the game so it doesn't break any rules.
---
yeah i guess I couldnt call mine a true glass cannon build, but I really dont want to wander around with low health all the time and sit in a tin can PA for everything I do. exception being scavenging for junk or something.
---
I put a strength bobblehead for 3000 and someone bought it. Maybe they saw I was lvl 30.something and wanted to be generous
---
Meh. Survival is not fun because of the flood of duped TSE lasers with splitters. Nuclear Winter levels the playing field, so if I want a shoot 'em up that will be the go to game. 
---
Maybe after they level the playing field.
---
How do you launch a nuke?
---
😨
---
I had one player buy 6 high priced items today, first sales of the week.  And I price cheap lol.
---
Well I can't argue with that.
---
I did see dr.brauns name in a computer log.... the man who was in charge of the virtual reality vault...
---
Beyond having additional maps to play on, I doubt the beta and release version will be all that different.
---
.First and foremost - What is the goal of the game? What does endgame entail?
---
**For now? Nuke the Scorchbeast Queen as far as the "goal", and high level events/gear for end game**
---
.I know our C.A.M.P. is our main home. But, where are you meant to build? Are there specific, ideal places to build or just wherever you want?
---
**Everywhere/anywhere except for restricted areas, such as towns/locations etc. If you're camp unit is green, it can be placed there.**
---
.Is 'Survival' mode mainly for those who want more PvP? Seems like the best place for XP grind.
---
**Pretty Much**
---
.There a point to taming enemies? Seems like people are constantly having them killed by other players (both on purpose and accident) which makes it seem like a pain for what looks like another cosmetic option.
---
**Yes, imo it is mostly cosmetic. Although it does offer a bit of defense to your camp while you are away, but I don't honestly know how useful it is.**
---
.Is loot and XP properly shared between players in a group? Seems like a game meant to group with others. This isn't appealing to me though if we're fighting for items and XP.
---
**XP is not "shared". You only get credit if you tagged (shot) an enemy. Most loot is instanced though.**
---
.Generally how long until you reach level cap?
---
**There really isn't a "level cap" per se. Level 50 is when you stop getting points to place in a category, but you still level up and you still get card packs every 5 levels.**
---
.What are the best ways to earn loot and Xp in the game? From what I see, doing the random events around are best.
---
**Events, WesTek, White Springs, Nukes etc. . .**
---
.Is there a point to having multiple characters other than anyone just feeling like having them?
---
**More caps space**
---
.I love sniping and sneaking to kill from stealth. Saw some people say snipers are garbage while some others pointed out they can be good. How are snipers in this game? Is making a build around them viable?
---
**Imo, yes. Invest heavily in rifle/crit/vats perks. You can become an unforgiving stealth damage monster.**
---
How are they companions if they don’t follow you?
---
Fasnacht was awesome! It was great seeing so many people together, my camp was really close to Helvetia too so I got a lot of visitors
---
Never thought of how good BR could be for that nice intro to adventure mode!
---
I think my post was poorly worded. What I really mean is that it would be a good idea to have these camps “saved” just like the blueprint system BUT when you go to choose one it will place it down where it was saved originally, instead of you having to place it. With more elaborate buildings, they can exist in only a few spots.
---
What is considered a farm tool?
---
I got better
---
I wouldn't accept a team invite from someone completely out of the blue unless it was clear that we were all doing the same thing (i.e. we're all in the missile silo together).  Even though PvP isn't as much of a thing in Adventure Mode, they can still go and screw around with your CAMP.
---
Granted, it used to be worse.  You used to be on the hook for any Workshops they owned, which exposed you to PvP anywhere on the map.  That's not the case anymore.
---
If you do accept it, and they are far away, just keep an eye on where they go on the map.  If they go straight to your CAMP, go there yourself and see what they're doing.
---
As far as team etiquette, the only rule I have is that if someone in your team appears to have a lot of Rads and a little bit of health, don't use the Radsponge perk.  They have those Rads for a reason. 😉
---
You😂 finally😂 stopped😂😂 using😂😂 emojis😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Well slap my thigh and call me susan, we got there in the end;)
---
Survival shouldn't be PVP based, who kills the most, who stays longer alive... That is BR. Survival should be adventure with PVP possibilities, the wasteland being hard.
---
Near to
---
Emmett Mountain Disposal Site
---
This gives the best balance between the 2 free fast travel spots (your camp and vault 76) to cover the entire map.
---
40% damage bonus doesn't do much?
---
Lol that's possibly why I got it in my head.
---
It does, thank you.
---
I didnt even realize that - that’s strange.
---
All over the rooftops of Watoga, either they were prewar or used by the BoS. Not to mention Camp Venture that has a Vertibot too.
---
Someone bought a pencil off me for 1000. Was genuinely surprised about that one
---
that's all fine and dandy but I already know I liked this game and specified that. I was just hoping things had gotten fixed to see if I should come back.
---
Blueprints are a must! I'm yet to see other people utilise them but I reckon this'll start to change. 
---
My tower blueprint has helped win my team 3 games so far as it gives us the high ground and any players that try entering get 3 crossbow bolts in 'em as soon as we hear the door open. It's gotten me at least in the final 5 multiple times when I've been solo too.
---
Awesome, thanks. PvPing in the Ash Heap was what I had in mind when I wrote this.
---
Brahmin Pen plan
---
Not to the point where people have to cry over it no. 
---
I am rank 40 with a melee build and I win about 75% of matches. I would be the one to know if something is overpowered or not. 
---
Just be good at the game and stop blaming the perk cards.
---
Agreed. Everyone on the team should get the kill as long as they shot someone for at least some damage.
---
So childish with the emojis
---
😂😂😂😂
---
I was surprised how weak Power Armour is, but I do think it offers a significant advantage. Outside of PA I die to one or two shots, but I can survive a modest burst in my tin can.
---
Just Glastonbury them on facebook. Almost no one uses reddit anyway. These nonsense rules are getting laughable.
---
I think the vending machines have improved since launch, but I still have NEVER purchased anything from them.
---
I hope you are right.
---
"GET HIM!", Stevie and Ray in unison.  *Shots fired everywhere*
---
I know that. The name never appeared. But that is a problem with the game, not with my photographic technique.
---
Trifold American flag for 1776 caps
---
There are countdown timers during some of it. I just try to move towards the inner rings on the map early. Because yeah. Burned to a crisp.
---
I agree with you. People on this sub are the same people that don’t believe that any of fallout 76’s problems ever existed and that we are just lying about it. I’m not denying that the game is good now but it wasn’t back then.
---
I actually think fo76 would be a much better game than it already is if there were no legendaries in a/s modes.  Think about it, people only look for legendaries, making weapons plans themselves worthless and really armor as well.  There is no point in me knowing how to make Marine Armor at my workbench when Im only going to wear legendary gear.
---
Would probably take care of the duping issue.  No legendaries, then why dupe?
---
Ah. Pretty sure those were prewar emergency services vertibots, or something like that. 
---
But yeah, I forgot about the camp venture bot. That makes sense.
---
What's you GT?
---
They corrected that as I have a lot of diseases from bearing spoiled veges with herbivore
---
There is no end game yet...
---
This is exactly what community managers should be doing. Listening to their playerbase and trying to move forward in a positive way with their ideas!
---
Unfortunately there is not much you can do. If you have friends online, make sure you are on their server that way you can just rejoin to that server. But even that doesn't always work since if the whole server crashes everyone will be kicked.
---
Yep! Thus the reason why I avoid voice chat! As then I turn into the ahole. 
---
SOME kids are okay on the voice chat, but the majority just start rambling nonsense or start saying wierd / creepy inappropriate things, etc.  If I can't figure out how to mute them easily, it's one of the few ways that will send me into stupid rage.
---
I started my current char in survival when survival started. Sure many didn't but I did because I like the challenge. 
---
Anyone can do that as well. I see low level chars all the time so I know I'm not alone. 
---
By your comments I can tell you haven't played much survival. I promise you it's not what you think. It really is fun. Just accept death as inevitable and your good.
---
I like to lay traps for people when I get on the leader board. I'll go to a location and have a team mate back me up and snipe at people as they come for me. I die eventually but it's fun.
---
Or my 25. And they better retroactive rewards if they put new ones xDDD
---
I kinda get it but I just don't see the point of ut besides for role play
---
Oh there’s a fair amount to comment on - they just generally aren’t allowed
---
And when you knock someone down but another person gets kill credit for finishing them
---
The only way I know of is if you have a friend on the same server or add someone from your recent players so you can rejoin the session. You have to spend the caps again but everything you built stays there. Had it happen to me after doing a powering up quest to run the fusion core processor at one of the power plants, I was pretty mad
---
Suggest just South East not too far from the centre. Then you can have two free travel locations for the map, which includes vault 76.
---
I put any grenades I get into the vendor for about 15 caps each. Some madman bought ten.
---
Thank you very much. A few follow up questions if you don't mind:
---
.I worded my CAMP question poorly. Are there spots meant to be more beneficial for a player to make a home on e.g. if you make a home near here, you can farm materials?
---
.What do you mean by "More caps space" in regards to making multiple characters?
---
Someone had an IOU Toilet Paper note in their vending machine, and I purchased it for 100 caps.
---
" No details about possible robot or animal companions. "
---
In a game where they were vehement about the only humans present are players, and a background story of robots replacing all the workers, it boggles my mind that the answer on robotic companions isn't an instant, "yes."
---
They're usually in seemingly random locations, named "Horde event: [Location]"
---
And [Location] can be The Forest, The Mire etc.
---
Being naked is actually a good strategy. Those blues stand out a mile away.
---
Does explosive affix cancel it out as previously stated? Especially if the explosive effect hits multiple targets?
---
And now the stew doesn't spoil!! Great tip.
---
I just said that I went to go take the picture even less than 10 feet from the ground (more like 3 feet away from the camera).  The camera simply did not work in that situation. But there is no reason the target should have to be in a specific position to get a shot. .This a problem with the game that needs to be fixed.
---
Aah, yes, the classic "do they float?" which even I can remember. I'm beginning to feel old.
---
Ahhh when you can’t milk a freaking Brahmin because the game is bugged. So great!
---
I knocked 3 players on an enemy team, while the randos on my team were gangbanging a mirelurk. I didn't stop to get the kills because I was literally wiping an entire team solo. I had the 4th guy pinned behind a tree, with 10% health left before my "teammates" finally finished off their 1 mirelurk, killed the three downed players, and then bumrushed the 4th, getting the knock and kill.
---
I got 15 XP out of what should have been 60, and they got 45 for doing nothing. Go ahead and give me a "participation trophy", I'll recommend a good place for you to stick it.
---
So what you are saying is, that as a FREE player you see no issue at all with how badly they screwed up the game for those who PRE-ORDERED and paid cash for things they did not get. If the game had been great the fact is their would never be a free chance to play, so as long as it worked out in your favor it seems fine..   
---
Well F that.   I hope this game ends the career of everyone involved on the dev side. I feel not bad at all for saying that..This game amounted to theft pretty much, it was one of the worst games EVER released  and probably the worst period at its launch price point...  
---
 Many of us who were robbed by this game will NEVER under any condition buy another game from this company,and slapping some dumb kid mode from fortnite on here will not change one thing ...AT all .
---
As a filthy casual, if I've done this to anyone, I'm horribly sorry. I don't care about XP at all, my only goal is to try to get my squad as far as possible in the round. I just assumed the entire squad got the XP for a kill.
---
Yes. . . Glad it will be over soon personally. Trying to sell my shit over here , lol.
---
No pets but I believe BG did this to encourage teaming up and working things together. I always liked having dog meat on my adventures but can you imagine having four players on a team with four dogs overwhelming the enemies. It would be chaos out there.  Then think of pvp
---
My Battle Royale skills would give Steven Hawking a run for his money.
---
You're not allowed to call me susan anymore...
---
I disagree. After the tenth "stash increase" post or yet another "here's my totally unworkable suggestion to make the game great) post, not much new to reply to.
---
I remember in the beginning people complained about the budget and about a week after the servers went completely to shit.
---
It turned out everyone was using a glitch to have unlimited storage and camp budget and it was nuking the servers horribly.
---
Who cares tho when you want shit to look cool I guess/s ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It is a skin. SADLY. SO SADLY. They could have added a high-end BR item for adventure like a new PA set (with a mix of excavator + x01 stats), the Hellfire PA to reward those who shutted down ZAX (you could in theory shut down ZAX at lvl 100). They didn't. They put a skin.
---
I hope this game and company end sooner rather than later, and they start a reality show so we can follow their adventures in the welfare line.
---
Why multiple characters?  Your character has a cap limit of 25,000.  But some weapon trades go for 40,000 making it neccessary to have a more than one character.  You have a weight limit, so if you collect weapons you might want to store extras on a low level alternate.  Also, you might want a sniper build for solo play but in a group your strength, mele build works better.  I suspect having a single character works just fine for most players.
---
Last hit kill credit is universally a bad idea. This has been proven time and time again in games over the years.
---
I'm really encouraged by the direction this game is taking overall, but why do the devs have to keep making design choices that are already *well* established as mistakes?
---
It's been the same on ps4 since the last patch. I expect it at white springs, but not in flatwoods or vault 76 lol.
---
Voice chats wack bruh
---
If you got stuff like the chest or weapon skins you can go to the atomic shop to find them
---
Multiboxing yes, but input broadcasting or scripting are different than just multiboxing. I know both are illegal in EVE for example. Although there's tons of both going on there.
---
Wood Armor (possibly) *can* make you camouflaged in Nuclear Winter. Or the camo suits. Running a stealth/sniper build in Nuclear Winter, I find myself a place to camp in and hope my guns have silencers on them. Just like **The End.**
---
*Good night!*
---
PS4. I was going to offer to fix you up with some good starting gear, but alas, it seems it is not to be.
---
What about crates
---
You the real MVP.
---
You're doc howling and I believe you're a doctor
---
Considering there are no limitations to the trial, I would think we've been given the full game already so no need to do anything.
---
We do not need Bangalore explanations.  The ping system would be great.
---
You receive them automatically. Afaik, you received a photo frame.
---
Why would you want to keep people out of your camp?
---
No :( not even an email sayig its on its way
---
Stop telling people this. Sheesh.
---
But knocking someone is 90% of the work, yet gives 50% of the reward.
---
Downing a moving target, who's firing back is much harder than shooting a kneeling player that can't move.
---
There’s a dead vault dweller at the campgrounds where the bug pioneer quest is. They’re in a portapotty.
---
Or leave your doors open
---
I run 85 round Handmade drums and find myself with too much ammo if anything.  Uranium Fever and scrapping down for tons of steel, or any WestTek run.  Hornwright Mining Site 3 for lead ore, and acid is everywhere.  I end up selling 5.56 or giving them away when I have too much.
---
Sacrifice for the greater good. That’s awesome. I did a similar thing. Last two on the team hunting the last others. I’m comes the SB so I run out to kill it and take it down other team is exposed blasting at me and my teammate kills them both for the win
---
The speed depends on where the next circle is located. The areas very close to the circle move much slower than areas where the circle has to cover a large gap between stages.
---
If you lock your camp. People can glitch in
---
I, literally, can't hit anyone with a crossbow. And I tried HARD.
---
NW and the free trial combined effect... nice to have done peace and quiet... until I need to buy lead or ammo.... no high level players with good supplies... flip side is that I have been selling out of stuff in my camp and my caps stash is reaching max... ready for a shopping spree next week when the NW trial ends and the high levels come back !!
---
Question lol. I’m not in with all the young slang
---
Ya but why would you not want them in? It's not like they can steal you junk.
---
The crates you see rewarded aren't actual lootboxes you have to open - these are cosmetics that you can see in the Atomic Shop.
---
I'll boycott them! I'll SUE them if they take away my amazing 4 levels!
---
I love wasting caps traveling to someone's base to find out that I can't even buy the stuff listed for sale
---
*brahmin pen
---
Thanks for bringing this to our attention! When you head back to Adventure, if you gain any XP (any amount at all) does that trigger your level-up?
---
I like to be prepared.
---
I expect to see "companions" in interior locations who don't leave. For instance you could meet someone in the lobby of the Watoga Municipal building and they can go through the area helping you defeat Scorched. They would probably have a line of dialogue explaining why they don't leave the building. Maybe when you travel to your Camp later, they drop in to say hi and give you some items.
---
Try running your preset graphic level at medium. I've read people with 2080's having issues running this game on Ultra setting. I doubt you will even notice a difference.
---
How else can I eave spoiled meat on their beds?
---
Locked perks would FORCE cooperation and specialization.  It would be amazing. You'd have to generalize and spread points, or specialize but be almost useless on your own.
---
I'd also dramatically drop carry weight like 4's survival mode, remove perks that reduce weight, and drop Stash to 400.  But I'm a masochist.
---

 &gt; Thanks for bringing this to our attention! When you head back to Adventure, if you gain any XP (any amount at all) does that trigger your level-up?
---
I too received my email and tracking number yesterday.
---
Well, if you aren't picking up flowers you won't notice it. It won't much matter then?
---
Personally, what I would like is to have your Workshop build setup be automatically saved, so you can instantly put it back down when you retake that workshop. That would mean you could out as much time and effort into decorating your workshop builds as you do your camp, and would give you the chance to create a bunch of new designs and styles, just like how FO4 had multiple settlements.
---
That sounds like possibly a PS4 setting....HOWEVER, if it's the game, go to your save data and clear it (don't uninstall the game, just the settings file). 
---
ALSO - Double check your TV settings. When I got my new tv a while back I was having some really crazy ratio issues, like you were describing, and realized I had my TV set in a weird mode.
---
The ones on the roof have the gunners doors on them, so they were indeed manned at some point. I just assume when they left the official military and joined the local BoS they'd bring all their old equipment and training with them..kinda an unspoken thing.
---
the accuracy yes, but it does say in the perk card that it increases damage too. but I might go off the fact it says all this "per shot" meaning just guns.
---
I'm really looking forward to the full release rumor has it there is also a Harper's ferry map that is smaller but that wasn't confirmed in what I've seen
---
Somebody won a match by just jumping and the nukelauncher xDD
---
Why would you even go on face book?
---
Yes, it was a ticket update that came in as an email. Spam folder maybe?
---
Sounds about right - basically most characters/builds are not done at 50, but around 80-ish you can get pretty close if you plan right.
---
Much love and respect to you!
---
That is mostly due to the "game is fkin trash" bug...The best fix for this is to uninstall, lose your game key code as lost as possible..Then log into reddit and tell TODDDDD how trash he is and how you will never buy anything that him or anyone he even knows is connected to.
---
I just want dog meat to watch my camp and keep out the trash enemies that for some reason spawn in areas my defense can’t get. I’ll build him a doghouse and be happy then
---
Ok thanks :)
---
I would say its either a PS4 or a setting on your TV proper.
---
Zoom/scaling comes to mind...or fit to screen.
---
Depends how hot the curry was...
---
Try to put in a ticket with Bethesda, best of luck to you.
---
It’s worth noting that If you have the plague walker mutation and you milk the cow you will begin doing damage to it right away
---
They're not garbage, lmao. Whoever claims so shall be cast to the deep abyss by my ~~Mosin Nagant~~ scoped lever action rifle.
---
Oh they are much stupider than that my friend......
---
Enclave probably, Modus is fully operational. BoS I hope not as can't be a successful brotherhood faction so far from Bunker Hill in lore. I'd like to see some brotherhood survivor however
---
Dont take nuclear winter away papa :(
---
Pls show how it looks
---
Soooo, going out to eat...?
---
Meh, just hit the LT again to disengage. I have noticed that though. But really you shouldn’t be using your scope in CQB. Pistols hip-fire decently well. 
---
Back in the day (like WWII) they actually trained soldiers to fire from the hip in CQB so their gun wouldn’t get knocked out out of their hand, and you could react to hand-to-hand attackers.
---
I just wanna know how we’re meant to get gear, I was level 0, in wood armor (not sure how I even got that) and mained by folk in marine
---
I have the flamer actually, just really hard to keep feeding ammo to it...  and it benefits from Rifleman which is a misfit for my Commando characters.  Just toying with the idea of a laser rifle to use, I have an ultracite gatling laser and gatling plasma for energy heavy weapons.
---
Thanks for the answer! Now I can stop spamming the stimpack button XDDDDDD
---
i'm currently only level 6 and have only used one special point currently on perception and got the perk for aiming at body parts with V.A.T.S, should I start again because of the un-needed perk card? or just carry on, guessing it's not worth starting again really.
---
Does this build seem good now?, thank you again for the help
---
That is my entire point!
---
I ran with a low (10) level player the other night... he couldn't hack computers, so I did it for him. I can't pick locks (I REFUSE to swap perks.... just a "House rule" for me), so I needed him, etc. 
---
It adds SO MUCH to the game. It really does.
---
Look on the top right, there is an indicator that shows how close the storm is to you in a bar type graph. The extreme left red growing bar is the storm, you are the white dot in the middle and on the extreme right, the tan(?) section is the safe zone.
---
The storm doesnt uniformally shrink, if you peek the map while the storm has subsided, the lighter smaller circle, will be the next safe area after the storm subsides again. Sometimes you have the storm shrinking in two directions against you, so you kinda have to use where the storm is going to move, so you can try and negate the storms speed.
---
Only your self respect will be ruined...
---
has the game gotten any better?
---
Honestly, I am one of the fools the pre-ordered and might come back.
---
Hi! Thanks for your report. When you switch back to Adventure, can you try gaining any amount of XP to see if that triggers your level-up?
---
If that doesn't help, please let me know. Thanks!
---
I think it would be cool if they allowed us to build robot companions like in 4. They could either guards camps or follow you around, but the latter would take up a slot in your party.
---
Ah! Good point! I just found it odd they never mentioned them. I imagine they’d be very useful for dealing with with the Huntersville mutants or connecting with The Responders over the mountains, or fighting Scorchbeasts (probably not as effective in this capacity, but they could certainly act as a distraction while heavy weapons engage from the ground). But yeah, if it’s a common enough thing, they might not think to mention it. 
---
Good eye for detail!
---
Solos, am already tired of playing with other players.
---
Just a guess, maybe he's hoping you go down and he can stimpack you to revive you as part of the Scout badge quest?
---
Rpgmo?
---
I’m a vet of Iraqi that plays. Very rarely do I come across other vets.  Where is the community in reddit?
---
Just carry on - at your level you don't have to worry too much.  Early on you're limited in perk cards you can pick anyways.
---

 &gt; Hi! Thanks for your report. When you switch back to Adventure, can you try gaining any amount of XP to see if that triggers your level-up?
---
 &gt;
---
 &gt;If that do...
---
PS4 , I have also had many more crashes since Monday night. I had gotten used to not crashing as much. A timeline ; November-January 25% crash rate, February- June 10 7% crash rate . Improved a lot . June 10 -current 30% crash rate. Just rough estimates. It's the heavier server load for sure.
---
I was scoping someone from far away. My scope didn't release and I wasn't ready for that-- got shot from behind while trying to get ADS to release
---
Some of the new players were annoying after awhile,  but overall it was good. Flatwoods was full of low levels too. Felt alive for once.
---
Horse armor, dude... shit like this never goes away.
---
I got an email that it is on the way!
---
Ah thank you anyway :),
---
I think I have ended up with this haha: [Build Link](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f634c5b&amp;d=sq1s31sr1s22cu0ip2ls2l71lt2ic0s12id2cm2a00sb2p10i11s72sg2eh2pg0ph0pi0pa0p80a80lu2&amp;w=pe2cr0i71im1in1iq2lm2at1ii0if2p70a70c12c72c52&amp;n=Heavy%20Energy%20Gun%20Build&amp;m=c29ef)
---
Thank you again for all your help
---
Yeah, I"m thinking that card is highly sought after. I got lucky to get it but I have to respec to use it :(
---
Sounds like fun to me...  and then when pvp they should dissappear or something. idk, dont seet as a trouble. I would love to see someone tame a deathclaw or shit like that. I have played and seen a lot of online games with this kind of implementation and never thought that it was out of control. And this is a game that could benefit from having a companion in my opinion.
---
Random Number Generation. Think of the armor and weapons as having their attributes on wheels in a slot machine. If you kill an enemy and it drops a weapon, the first wheel that sets is the kind of weapon (melee, pistol, rifle, etc), the next one is the specific weapon in that class, and the next couple of wheels are all mods for that specific weapon. A lot of the icons on the mods wheel are blank, so if the RNG rolls one of those on your loot, you get a base weapon or armor with no mods. Next to that, there are wheels for legendary attributes. Most of those icons are blank, and they appear to be weighted so landing on the highly-desired attributes is rare. 
---
The actual behavior of the RNG isn't entirely random. Some servers appear to give more mods/legendaries, and among the ones that do, some of those appear to favor certain attributes. You might wind up with multiple armors with the Life-Saving legendary attribute off a single server run through Whitesprings, as an example.
---
The chances of getting a specific legendary effect is slim I recommend saving up your caps and purchasing one from a player vendor.
---
God I just want Codsworth, even just a generic Mr. Handy. I love those robots so much.
---
You can solo or duo by turning off the team fill option. I've seen plenty of people winning as solo players. I don't think separate queues will work. After the free week, I suspect they won't have the player counts that a game needs to split the community and still have very short queue times.
---
Ehh. I wasn't annoyed at all. I encountered some squeakers... super excited and fun. Some "Strong silent" types that I just ran with and helped out where I could... I really enjoyed it.
---
Mighty generous... but man you are missing out!!
---
thats no fun!
---
As a makeshift solution, turn your graphics down to low. My rig (which is powerful enough to run this at 60fps but it apparently doesnt) had big loading times and ran at 30fps, ~~like a console peasant console~~ so I had to put it to low. I took only 2 months before I finally succumbed and had to potato-i-fy the game up. It doesn't look too bad.
---
It has 13 times the lore...Because we have no lore it is left to the imagination thus actually infinite lore..Boom 13 times the lore delivered ....Next tissue..
---
Maybe Survival gets similar treatment...
---
Fair enough. Thank you.
---
Me too. Adventure mode was emptier than Battlefront 2015.
---
Events were always the best source of XP for me. You can level surprisingly fast, just by doing nothing but running events around the map.
---
It's the game itself not having a sliding bar for screen size. My 55" Magnavox has about 1/2 inch cut off on all sides. It's not a big deal, but it's slightly annoying trying to read things sometimes.
---
All of the clothes should be in the Atomic Shop.
---
They should give us the ability to unlock helmets, outfits and hats for like, 50 atoms each after we've collected them. It would consume the item in the process, but you can remake it through the crafting bench like other cosmetics. 
---
That way teams can better theme themselves for NW, and you'll be able to see your collection of clothes, including those you're missing.
---
* No VATS, so people have to actualy aim
---
* Start each round with nothing, so we are (mostly) on even footing
---
* Our adventure camp is not on this map, so no griefing issues
---
* Losses do not carry a penalty, so playing PvP doesn't harm our P.E progress
---
Not that I can really say much, since the one NW round I was on the winning team I also didn't kill a single person...
---
I'd say quests. In one day from doing quests on a new account I got 20lvls but on my friends açcount he got like 10-15 from killing mobs in a day.
---
On xbox you can join anyone's game.  So if you have friends playing with you it's easy.  If not you can take a picture of active players on your server and rejoin.  This has been an issue since launch and people have been asking Bethesda for a way to rejoin your last server for disconnects.
---
Yeah, it was just like a plan that you learned without learning any plans. I have it, and it's pretty dumb, and I've learned to associate it with toxic GTA tryhards from an earlier experience.
---
I tested a couple different weapons against a couple different targets and Furious would not work for me. #s showed the same no matter how many times I shot it.
---
When I’m bored.
---
Found out about the beds the hard way on the trial, haha. Thanks for the help.
---
I might try that when I'm home, kind of a bizarre fix but if it works it's all good
---
Yep, its bad... BR modes in general are so bad they are a meme at this point. No self respecting game dev would even think of making a BR mode in 2019 unless they literally gave 0 Fk's .. Fallout 76 is a meme that is only getting funnier.
---
Man, I love that topo map. Wish we could get that as a replacement option in Adventure mode
---
They never catch up.
---
What does that do?
---
I found out about the beds the hard way, haha. Thanks for the help.
---
You were dead anyway my dude. If they have your six and shoot first, you’re done for unless they lag.
---
Btw, I haven’t seen this mode lag? Like ever? Just people randomly not being able to join a team, and the ADS issue. Bravo 👏
---
Sure. But they can still be revived at that point and the downing means nothing if they are revived. 
---
Regardless, my point stands. It is good that they give some credit for downing.
---
gunsmith determins the rate at which your gun breaks, how many points you put into it is up to you.
---
there is another perk to repair your weapons to 200%. this can be  switched in and out as required. effectively doubles the life span. (ALL weapons)
---
another to repair your armour, power armour,ability to craft etc. You will end up requiring them all. most again, are only required for short periods. all depends on your play style.
---
new to the game ? dont bother until later, you can pick up weapons willy nilly.
---
what you dont need..... take - scrap them in order to learn plans
---
see these flowers all over the place... makes , with boiled water, drinks that will temp. increase stats. mole rat chunks increase you carry wieght, more from a radstag.
---
canned dog food and purified water are your best friends. Drugs SELL.
---
the list goes on and on.
---
this seems a lot more down to earth than my ideal suggestion of taming a deathclaw.
---
This was exactly my experience too!
---
The real question is when will fallout 76 be dead for good. The sooner Todd is unemployed the better.
---
I always switch my perks if I feel like hacking - much better perks to be had if I keep them off most of the time. Only you and time will be able to tell if it stays manageable for you - I hope it keeps working out for you! I'd love to get rid of my 5 intelligence points 😂
---
I believe Junk Piles can drop deathclaw hides. I believe. Thus; I'm not sure. But I think.
---
i was sad at first to however we have the technology to rebuild him.
---
(Also check out the camp cost 🙀)
---
for melee, high strength.  
---
martial artist3, glowsight3, bloodymess3, fireproof.
---
Consider one ghoulish.  (When you are up close and personal, you will get some rads.)
---
Also decide if you want 1H or 2H weapons as the focus - there are perks for each.
---
  2H weapons do high damage, but are slower and heavier.  1H weapons are lower damage, but faster.  As such, it is quite possible a fast 1H weapon can do more damage faster than a slow 2H weapon.
---
A couple automatic rifle perks are useful, especially when you start fighting things that fly.
---
if you are going to run mostly solo, I would not put too many points into charisma - most of those are for team play.  For solo, lone wanderer and perhaps tenderizer.
---
Yes this is a pretty significant oversight. I hope bethesda tweaks that because it can take a lot to put someone down.
---
Some people memorize where large chests spawn, along with clusters of medium chests.  It’s random, but nearby where I usually spawn there’s been about a 60-70% chance of a large chest.  I have also been lucky to grab a 50 cal at times as well.
---
Maybe as "new functionalities" of wastelander ;)
---
Does this even work anymore? Every time I try to do it with crops the store option is gone till I repair
---
Help us out here, super chief. How would points be awarded? It's a shooter, after all.. level is going to be the main metric used for team match making
---
I’ve got poison walker and in a second with one disease I can halve my Brahmins health. In 3 seconds he’s dead
---
Right OK, I see. The OCD in me thanks you.
---
Would love to see the enclave or BOS back.
---
It’s a business plan for sure and it’s good I actually enjoy getting to use some of my skins for PA and clothes that I have bought. Feels nice probably will buy some more stuff the more I play. They got me sold
---
Nuclear Winter has been fun for you? My teammates seem to not know what microphones even are to begin with. I haven't won a single match neither.
---
Imagine having to get together a gang to hit a place.  You'd need the heavy, the hacker, the theif, the supplier, and the doc. You would be able to play alone, sure, but places like RobCo, Watoga, and The Whitesprings would be nearly impossible without a solid team, or you could solo it but you'd be locked out of 75% of the rewards.
---
I play this on a PS4 Pro with an SSD. Don't have graphic options sadly, although I would love some. I cant stand those frigging God Rays.
---
I refuse to play this on PC, even though I have it there as well. The amount of cheaters in BR alone is ridiculous.
---
Reported 6 people over the course of 4 or so games on PC before I said screw it and went back to PS4.
---
I don't get why people cheat when it is so easy to observe them after death and literally watching them shoot THROUGH FUCKING WALLS.
---
No PC F76 for me until that is fixed.
---
This was literally my first criticism. Or like that thread the other day said, let you become a ghoul on death to pass the time.
---
Because they do not know anything AT ALL about pvp games. This is a slapped on mode that never had a chance to be good. It was made by a dev team who just screwed up one of the only sure things in gaming.. Do you think they are going to win awards branching themselves out into new fields at this point?
---
How did you get banned?
---
It drives me nuts! I’ve been playing with anyone from 1-19 and maybe 1 out of 10 had a mic. I find that very hard to believe that any semi serious gamer doesn’t have a head set. Now I got a few kids I play with that all have mics and we win probably 50 percent of games. We almost always make it to the top ten. But having extra armor, weapons, and ammo for the team is clutch. Sharing with your team so the are fit to their build seems to be essential as well. Stimpacks are gold in this mode! Also I feel like people don’t use their chems, which I have found useful because I don’t think they have negative effects.
---
Monsters can clip underground and follow you anywhere. You either have to leap frog your loot somewhere safe enough to fast travel or pick it up fast and drop server
---
Same here. Attached a video in my first submission and they sent me an email hours later telling me to fill out the exact same page that I had just filled out. ?????
---
*new pet (just one)
---
Yeah what I thought, need to get my first energy weapon haha, currently using a pipe pistol haha :P
---
Why are you banned?
---
I dont think they can afford another rumpus :).
---
so im boned? not being able to read is a bit more than annoying
---
Im ok with this , still sounds awesome!
---
Thank you. I thought about it from start, but always expected to get downvoted to hell. I managed to collect most weapon plans( with exception of revolvers and 10 mm pistol) before vendor changes And felt like gunsmith. Pretty pointless since it was during TSE shotgun boom.
---
I think sometimes the game just drops them like it does your shop inventory or occasional random inventory things
---
Why would you think the free trial days bypass your account ban?
---
Lmao laughed to hard at the last part.
---
Cheaters? What? The closest thing to a cheater I ***MAY*** have seen was a possible duper. What? Tell us more, Gramps!
---
Well.. look at how fo76 main game flopped. Is it really a surprise?
---
Only if your character has dark skin
---
Random Numbers Generator. Basically like rolling a dice to decide anything, would be the simple way of explaing it. It's a little more complex than that but the general jist is nothing is predetermined and everything is a case of luck.
---
Now that they are together no I don’t think they should be separated especially because stuff carries over from each mode. I say no. Also Bethesda is not bringing on a whole team just to work on two fallout games at the same time
---
I actually think something along these lines is likely, given the ‘new features’ icon for Wastelanders on https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Totally wishful thinking, but we can hope. :)
---
I used to upload some mods on Skyrim and apparently they had nudity which I was unaware of
---
Unnecessary and not happening.
---
You can develope bonbs and a relationships so they can return companionship❤
---
Mum? Is that you?
---
Nuclear Winter game mode needs a hub lobby.  Where we can spawn in to change our perk cards, listen to holo tapes, explore and manage our character in vault 53, without being in que for a game.
---
That way if someone needs to make a change they spawn there, and anyone ready to play spawns into matchmaking.  No need for 2 minute timers after that.
---
Can you not change it? There should be a setting for your TV so it fits.
---
I run a [low-health/bloodied utility rifle build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4d33abc&amp;d=sb1p00c71s01pd2pk2pp2pl2ir2ic3ib2s70ar2an2au2a30lt2lu2la2l71lr0eh1eu0&amp;w=ao0a12a02sg1cd1ce0&amp;n=&amp;m=124589acf) in ADV. I don't rely soly on VATS, so I focused away from CRIT perks in luck. I do enough base damage that I don't feel I need to. 
---
I also have a 10 in INT, as I focus on crafting and modding, so if you're not using bloodied or explosive weapons, you can reallocate points to anything you prefer.
---
I disagree. I enjoy that it gives your character exp/caps for playing NW. It is a fun tie in mode.
---
Yea as far as I know. You can try messing with the TV ratio settings, but 76 is the only game that cuts out like that for me. It's weird that the screen slider doesn't exist, I feel like it's been decently common for like 10 years now.
---
That cross bow is OP actually. Plus you shoot 3 bolts in a row! I try to keep one for killing AI stealthy.
---
i’d shell out all my atoms for some ear plugs. i can hear that mouth harp in my sleep now
---
Later tomorrow  from my emails, which is kinda ironic given I’m down the road from the UPS shipping hub it’s held at, at the moment.
---
Todd Howard takes the bet...
---
Just bear mind. . . If you have bulked materials on your person and scrap all, it will unbulk said materials. Which in turn costs you more plastic to rebulk those materials. A mistake I've made countless times myself lol. And it always irritates my OCD tendencies as well, because it's in my nature to always scrap all to save space.
---
Tbh Beths been doing EA things with there microtransactions for a bit now. But facebook posrs are objectibly terrible
---
Hi! Just wanted to confirm what a couple others mentioned, we're investigating an issue affecting Nuclear Winter Dailies and have disabled them for the time being while we work on a fix.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/348305/nuclear-winter-daily-challenges-temporarily-disabled-june-12-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
Did I say that
---
I’ve hidden a couple times and sniped other peoples downed enemies and stole their kill lol
---
They will look at your account and see if anything can be done on their end no guarantees.
---
Yeah, I got 2nd placement by hiding alone behind a tree. When the other 2 remaining teams engaged, I quietly sniped from a distance. None of them noticed me because of the chaos.
---
I am trash at MP FPS combat.
---
How much will most people sell them for

Playing bait is a lot of fun lol. In another situation, someone dropped a nuke and the fire forced us into it. With only one hazmat suit between us, we gave all our stimpacks to the best player on the team, and then ran in and hoped for the best. It worked out though—while we died either by rads or the last two players, hazmat teammate safely came in and killed them before they even knew he was there. Another win for our team.
---
Odd thing to hear from a Raider.
---
Why would you expect them to prioritize your nonsense? Your account is banned. You need an account to play. Problem solved.
---
Make a new account or, you know, accept it.
---
&gt; The Facebook comments on fallout are absolute TOXIC.
---
And this sub isn't? People on this sub will defend this game to the bloody end and if anyone says something negative (but factual) about it they will downvote them into oblivion and bury their comments/posts. 
---
Yes the game has improved since launch but there are still plenty of bugs and glitches that people experience every time they play and there are still bugs that have been around for a long time that never get fixed.
---
Oh, right.  "Things."  Sure, things have been fixed.  Other things haven't.  I hope that helps.
---
When your next pre order strangely cancels, you'll know Pete Hines got his revenge on you.
---
yea, 76 is the only game I have that does that too.
---
who knows, maybe I will be lucky and get a 'Bethesda replied' to this
---
I'm a melee player, but I have gunsmith3.  
---
There will come a time when you need some sort of firearm, gunsmith helps for adding mods/plans to make them better.  As with superduper, ammosmith, et al, I only equip it when needed.
---
As for hacking, early game, I ran hacker 3, lockpick 2 - I've switched to lockpick 3, hacker1.
---
I also eventually got the 200% repair on weapons/armor, and 160 on PA perks, so everything lasts a good while before it needs to be repaired..
---
There is a max cap limit? Never reached it.
---
Unaware of? 👀
---
Small brain
---
They shit on it due to outrage culture and review bombing. Everything in the atom shop is 100% acquirable with some gameplay and literally none of it is necessary to enjoy the game. People were mad it wasn't a single player FO experience with coop, and madness ensued. It's a good system designed to actually give you something to do after the first 50-75 hrs regardless if you have people to play with and I think it's completely reasonable.
---
dont take the wrong way, just saying, - if your l 13, and think youve covered 60%, then youve probably ran past a good 50%.
---
slow down a bit, trouble, and its XP, will find you soon enough
---
By working down at the DMV.
---
Buff Power armor in general.
---
Asking people if they got some ammo they don't need.
---
Dude the game is awesome!!nice of you tho,but u gonna regret it
---
I had a few T-baggers that wouldn't leave. You can tell when they haven't played a serious game like fallout when they walk up to you and spam the crouch button.
---
I dearly hope that the won't give up their adventure dna... That would be the worst.
---
Hahaha seriously? You saucy devil. Seems a bit harsh to get a lifetime ban for that. Could you not try to make a new account or is it an IP ban?
---
When in that situation, I switch to a weapon with less ammo requirement (either in components or just melee).  
---
For example, I'm now really short on lead, and I'm lucky to have a railway riffle, which only need steel for ammo crafting, so I will spend a while  shooting nails at enemies while farming lead.
---
There are no established prices, if you see a piece you can't afford message the person more often than not they will be willing to adjust the price or trade for another item.
---
I hit up the lead spawns once a day, then run through west tek for steel (scraper perk is essential) and that seems to give me 900-1500 rounds a day for my handmade and that probably only takes 30 minutes from start to finish so nbd.
---
We do have mics, and I’m playing with friends. Have you tried solo? You have to do a lot of running and hiding, but I’ve managed to get to top 4 and won a match just by hiding and letting everyone kill each other until I’m forced to come out of hiding. Keep the fire to your back too. That keeps you from having to check your six.
---
I hope that once the main story is over the npc will continue, walking the map, looting and fighting.
---
Yeah, I only see it as a win for multiplayer.
---
Lucky hole mine and an acid node in your camp
---
When I first started playing I say a guy jumping on to rooftops from the ground... I was wondering how this was possible.
---
Has there been any mention of decorating at E3 or post E3?
---
This sums up my experience with Bethesda as a whole. As a child of the 80's . We played a lot outside, always using the yard or living room as a world for my action figures to fight or be heroes. These huge worlds are the yard/living room, my character is my action figure . This is how Bethesda has kept me captivated for years.
---
it just gets memed by Bethesda in further games. I wouldn't be surprised if they make it a reference in the next fallout or even in the current game in a future update
---
That's a very passive-agressive way to hold the Atom shop profits of about 1/180,000th of the Reddit Fallout playerbase hostage until your requirements are met, but good luck holding out! We can absolutely buy from the ATOM shop, you do 't have to have every single purchase you make on display  :-p  Players can have skins that they don't use, have cosmetics that they never wear, have furniture that doesn't fit their CAMP build hidden away in their Build inventory; part of this game is resource management and that includes the metaresources of awarded and bought Atoms
---
I must have made 40+ leather armour/hunting rifle combos over the last week. Love seeing all the level 5s running around looking like my little clone army.
---
Beer hat for 25,000.
---
When crafting have the ammo Smith perk and the luck perk card super duper helps when crafting. Also try and take converted ammo factory work shop and hold it as long as you can.
---
It’s a solid weekly topic request along with fishing, new music and perk card decks
---
Na man would take away from the PvP combat if I play the ME more I want PvP not creatures to fight
---
I could totally be overlooking something as well, not sure...might go back and dig around a little today lol
---
I've tried every thing, live with it
---
Good tip, make your camp on a lead deposit ( keep in mind the max storage in it is 14 ) and just go do your own thing for a while - I find crafting ammo is a great way to keep up with all of your needs!
---
Just make a new account.
---
My teammates just run off 20 meters alone , die and then expect me to save them from 4 people with bad loot , because they took all the good loot for themselves , and then curse at me for not reviving them
---
I just want a dog.
---
err, thanks?
---
Yeah I kinda want to do this, go for a ranger style build. Rifle for range and finishing things up close with a trusty stabby.
---
I believe one of the community reps mentioned that instancing technology for interior cells was in the works, and this kind of thing is what they are referring to.
---
Yeah. I was honestly disappointed when I saw survival with legendaries. I was assuming they'd be ignored for pvp or just severely crippled in power. When I thought of survival, I thought of dayz for arma. But, glad to see it was put in with the battle royale
---
"they aren't my tiddys officer! never seen them before in my life"

Exclusive skins are bad, mmk

The main quest line will take you all over the map (well, not to all locations - by far - but to every region). But it's an open world game, and you're encouraged to just go exploring along the way.  
---
This map here will give you an idea where you should probably explore first (to avoid running into enemies that are way too tough early on):
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/  
---
As you've discored, you eventually get fast travel points all over the map, and that makes travelling so much faster.  
---
You generally gain more xp by killing stuff. "WV Lumber Co" all the way up northwest is pretty good early on. As you level up a bit more, Eastern Regional Penitentiary and Grafton Steel Mill are pretty good too - and as you hit 30+, Big Bend Tunnel has lots of xp (but boring item drops).  
---
Those 4 places are all packed with mobs (unless somebody just cleaned them out).
---
Shroud doesn't mind playing casual games just for fun. Dr Disrespect literally only cares about hyper competitive stuff. He wouldn't touch 76 with a 10 foot pole.
---
But all the loot is ours now lol
---
Farm the lucky hole mine for lead ore in excavator armor. I can get about 350-400 ore when doing with excavator armor. Collect acid to smelt it. 2 ore/1 acid gives 5 lead scrap. Need more gun powder 2 acid/3 clothe gives 15 gunpowder. Uranium fever is a great way to get steel especially when using scraper to deconstruct. Throw on ammo Smith and super duper and go to town.
---
Hell, I'd be happy with a Dogmeat player icon for now!
---
I'm currently level 7. I checked the challenges and this doesn't seem hard. The gun though is level 45, would be any good to store it for later if I get it?
---
Is this the factory where you need to find the food and the robots are shooting you?  I'm like incapable of doing this solo and haven't been lucky enough to have others nearby in Adventure..
---
You have to find the mags in their spawn points for them to count toward challenges
---
I found out after buying a few from a vendor and noticing that they didn’t count
---
A nuclear winter has nothing to do with snow, and everything to do with smoke and dust blocking out the sun 👍
---
I already have a second Bethesda account but I can’t even try to link that to my Xbox account because Bethesda isn’t replying to me

This has been suggested and [Bethesda has commented on it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz8hsu/nw_please_make_the_option_to_requeue_into_vault_51/eqqzu7m)
---
I actually love this idea. Of course they'd take pre-war money. It makes perfect sense and it would give both pre-war money and those machines an actual use.
---
You're killing the brahmins of other players? I feel like you shouldn't do that. I don't even think they drop food. Flatwoods has a lot of meat for you though.
---
I hope that isn't the case. Still, I've been playing daily since beta and the best thing I've gotten is a science scribe outfit. Now I just feel self-conscious that I'm too shiny.
---
Quick question about the Scrapper perk: The card says it gives more ressources when scrapping weapons and armour. So does it apply for junk too?
---
Awesome, I hope it works out!
---
Sorry about that! It's added into the Imgur post now.
---
-1 AGI
---
I kinda hope they reconsider that. If they can't follow you around in game then it's a bit boring.
---
You get what you deserve...
---
Someone else mentioned lucky hole mine but I just want to say use excavator armour because you get 4x as much from the lead nodes, and if you take hemlock holes, spruce knob and abandoned bog town workshops together they produce 50 acid like every 20 minutes ish
---
If you want to kill brahmins just got to flat woods there is usually four there.
---
Not true. Light skin blends just as well against the brown and yellows of the nuclear winter world.
---
Yes, it's 25k per character.
---
Ouch that's rough especially considering RNG can be pretty vicious not to mention they love to fall or move from where they are and either be invisible (have to hover over where the game says it is) or semi in an object like the ground. I'll have to step up my searching game then and make a side list for ones I need to find versus buy.
---
I'd like to see an attempt at the very least. I think if PUBG has been able to keeo duos and solos up while other BRs have came into the market and stolen alot of the playerbases (Apex, Fortnite, Blackout, the multitude of FTP BRs. Etc). 
---
NW offers to alot of people a PvP experience thats actually less risk than Survival and IMO alot more fun and balanced. Theres just something about this BR thats  just fun as hell. Im not sure why, but i think it has to do with how it doesnt have an esports or competetive scene behind it to bring that kind of atmosphere. ( this is my experience so far may be totally wrong. )
---
Maybe! I would have investigated this myself, but my internet connection has stopped working, so I can’t use my Xbox, just my phone.
---
it'll be an item in the ATOM shop
---
Toxic water for ten caps.
---
Dick move.
---
Happened to myself as well just over a month ago with the Resolute Veteran reward.     I don't remember what I was doing exactly the next thing you know I see this gatling gun displayed on my screen as a reward.    I thought the game was slow in displaying some legendary I had looted and didn't think to much of it.   A short time later I realized it was the survival mode reward weapon.    Just like yourself I had not even entered survival mode even once at that point.   It hasn't happened since but you are certainly not alone in having it happen.
---
Had no clue.
---
Check out YT. This is happening very often and blatantly on PC. At least wall hacking and aimbotting.
---
I posted a video here and it got deleted.
---
I wasn't talking about your teammates, I was talking about mine. I've tried hiding and tried a The End-like tactic of camping in 1 spot, moving only to the safe zone if it's not where I am, and then killing anyone who comes into my aim, and that didn't work neither.
---
Right so make sure to dump your bulk into your storage before scrapping junk?
---
I truly believe the mod involved hentai content 😂😂
---
I thoroughly enjoyed hanging out with codsworth.
---
That's a bit disappointing.
---
The challenge isnt directed at the mode but survive in the wasteland in general.
---
I agree but then again maybe it was because nothing about the natural progression of the game seemed natural? Idk if im making a point but it felt like that... like I have done this a million times. Now i want to see something interesting, and then everything was like playing the old games but just connecting to a server just because...
---
I hoped to see some reunion point, chat zone, comercial zone... found out that theres not that much and by seeing the map I can tell that everyone is pretty much runing by themselves. Something is not clicking, maybe?
---
YES THANK YOU. Have an upvote!
---
They respawn it’s cool.
---
It doesn't, only works on weapons/armor, and only the base mats (steel/wood).
---
There is a bug you can like for once, kind of like when feed the people really did feed all the people on the server, I miss those days.
---
Don't worry no one is getting "hooked" . Literally zero chance of that.. We all own many other BR games made by actual pvp minded devs. No chance any real gamer will give this a serious look.  For myself and those I know IRL this is not even enough to make us consider a re-install of this pile of trash.   
---
 This is going to win no battles in the minds of fallout fans .
---
Let us quit when we're downed for I'll balanced where to have no chance to get up. No need to force me to sit there for 3 minutes for no reason. Stop forcing me to reload the game.
---
In all honestly. I would have no problem with that. I’m just hoping they add this later down the road.
---
This cannot be said enough. I think it needs a little bit of rethinking. Juat unsure how they would do it.
---
Kinda harsh just RPing a raider.
---
I had the same problem yesterday (PS4)
---
Great! I knew I wasnt paying enough attention to events
---
And what do we use to burn witches?
---
Nothing for junk and it is only really useful for weapons.    You will get a ton more steel and some other resources using it.   Armor just gives piddly amounts of extra scrap.
---
correct.. its on the list of things B is aware of...
---
That is awesome, thanks for sharing man, didn't know they had a roadmap
---
Yeah it’s the only real damage you can do to a camp on Adventure mode.
---
I am not a fan of that either, as a player with limited time I have no interest in having an alt for NW and the special I have for adventure mode is not what I ideally probably want in NW, would be nice if everyone could just select them like we do perk cards.
---
2 steps forward one step back
---
Latest patch broke it
---
awareness is at an all time high
---
Killing mobs would be like something you do with a party of friends to hang and have fun maybe? is it possible to run to a horde of super mutants and find a boss without having to do a quest?
---
they aren't Google...so hopefully they don't remove something beloved by many
---
I want to see how many damage I did to players. Some XP on top would be nice though.
---
Some are players icons, others are buildable stash boxes on adventure mode
---
It is def the point this exsists.
---
How is running around to different camps, hoping players have brahmin, any more efficient than running to Flatwoods a few times? I do it all the time and I'd rather not annoy other players so...
---
Actually I think they have to be repaired
---
My dad has a brain tumor. So, my father's days with him are numbered. This is so touching. I am on Xbox and will go look for your camp when ever I am on.
---
Thanks! Ill hit up lucky hole
---
Play the game and level up...
---
Yeee , I really wanted the edition but all the complaints bummed me out into cancelling :c.
---
Very happy about this as I've been working so much this week and haven't had much chance to play it at all.
---
Top move by Bethesda.
---
Was thinking about moving my base near a lead deposit
---
Don’t kill players Brahmin, that’s just not cool. There’s plenty at flatwoods
---
Survival challenge can be done in adventure again? Gotta love Bethesda lol
---
They're also trying to make sure it doesn't give advantages in NW.  That's one reason you can't wear the all lack operator underarmor that you can buy in Atom shop.
---
No. If this happens I'll never play again. We don't need dozens of ghouls running around after they died. Dumb ass fucking idea.
---
What the hell is wrong with you? Go to Flatwoods.
---
Yes you can but your best bet of doing that would be looking for the events that pop up on the map.
---
No, they don’t. They have to be “repaired “
---
Since ppl are bringing up team xp for kills, we should also have Bethesda revisit the issue of team xp for kills in PvE modes. It has been one of the most frustrating and disappointing parts of teaming up with others and going adventuring in PvE, and having to tag the same enemies just to get credit.  
---
Everyone on a team should get credit for a kill in NW and PvE, as long as they're within a certain radius or area limit of their team, so it isn't like someone getting xp when across the map from another member.
---
Ok thanks for the info man!
---
Literally just the bag in a plastic mailing bag and a sachet of silica gel. I have pics but not sure where to upload them to post here.
---
- Everyone has a new/separate NW mode character.
---
- As you rank up in NW mode, you unlock points and perk cards.
---
- You are placed into lobbies with people close to your level to keep things fair.
---
You kill my moo moo?  No meat for you - bad human!
---
Hm... maybe legendaries should have downsides, to make them situationally worth using but also give basic armor a way to compete.
---
How do you know it was a mistake? 
---
Curious.
---
The ring moves proportionally fast compared to how far that part of the ring needs to move in order to reach the new ring. This is so all sides of the ring reach the new ring at the same time.
---
 So if you start at the edge of the map and the second ring is on your half the ring will move relatively slowly, but for people on the other side it will move quickly.  You should always check the map shortly after logging into the match to see if you need to plan to move earlier or if the new ring is close enough that you can wait to run.
---
Dutch door... Now there is something I did not realise is unique to my country.
---
If that’s what you are all about, don’t be a puss, play in the pvp server
---
It was crazy seeing a reak cheater . Usually never encountered one in awhile in my gaming career.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
There aren't that many cheaters. Maybe rarely, but I'm lvl ~30 in NW and haven't encountered one cheater.
---
lol, I see what you did there...
---
We all knew this would happen. I warned people about this and people downvoted me to hell. Guess they didn't want to believe it
---
They are not trying o fix the game. They are trying to do the bare minimum to avoid law suits and avoid losing their jobs. This game can not be fixed without a complete re-imagining and overhaul of all systems within it.  Those of us who were scammed out of our money over a year ago have got zero time for that..   
---
 Fallout76 is a dead game, very very very dead.. The only reason we see anything at all is because of contractual obligation to do something for 8hrs a day.
---
Me too, I can take a break from farming adventure, but still earn some caps and XP as I try to respec my character a bit.
---
Super comprehensive guide, thank you very much for your time.
---
Yup, or sell it first if that was your intent.
---
They are going to have to explain how that works.
---
Play survival then? Why do you get satisfaction by being an ass?
---
Fertilizer is pretty common.
---
Sorry I have +40 more rad resistance than you lol. For real though, i'm lvl 62 in AM and 10 in NW, and prob 6 of the perjs I have gotten were duplicates. We're no better off than you.
---
Same boat as you. Encountered no cheaters, except a possible duper.
---
Yep and now that GunFu stopped working I am using hip fire more and it helped in NW
---
Very few ISPs give static IPs so even an IP ban is likely not permanent.
---
Don’t really like Flatwoods.
---
4 matches, meh, even shooting some dude point blank with a pump action I got punched to death. I can see how it’d be fun with a coordinated group, but Australia, so pass
---
Well, if you’re not having fun, maybe don’t play it? That’s going to come off sarcastic, but I genuinely mean it. I don’t mind if I win or not, and so far the sneaking and hiding strategy has gotten me to the top 4 and above in every match I soloed. That’s pretty good in my book.
---
It’s Facebook. Let’s be honest.
---
I RP as a Raider so more fun to cause havoc to innocent players.
---
Goblins are weak to fire
---
True. Still suck as a person
---
How to fix it....
---
Step 1 Get job at Bethesda as developer
---
Step 2 Change code that shows silly bunch of numbers after components
---
How did you not know your mods had nudity unless you used other peoples assets (without even checking what those assets are)
---
Thats great that they can keep the momentum going
---
If I buy the disk will my stuff Carry over from trial?
---
Don’t like losing my Junk or Aid though
---
Its staying!
---
Make it so you can build closer to those on your friendslist maybe even overlap areas so you can really build a town.
---
Worst case, a server hop has fixed this issue for me.
---
Or if they add the ability to pay a certain amount of scrip to add random legendary effects to weapons. Then players would be encouraged to learn the plans and be capable of making the best gear so they can then turn them into legendaries. Itd have to be alot of scrip though, like 100 for a one star or something.
---
Kinda an extreme reaction.
---
You get levels just playing NW due to it giving you adventure mode xp.   Just a little extra grind.
---
Holy hell, I didn't realize it was so easy to find cheats on 76 for PC, you just need a credit card.
---
This may be the only reason I'm happier playing on console?
---
Today someone found out the previous overseer of vault 51 and there is an article explaining some of the lore. I would suggest to search it.
---
Thank you for your response. 
---
I understand its just a skin, but the option to change it to the skin at the work bench doesn't even show. 
---
And im unsure or what weapon system the skin is attributed to. 
---
I was told once i reach rank 11 I would have access. 
---
All I see the the ability to change the color to a ridiculous looking blue camo color.
---
I have friends that just got into FO76 due to the free weekend, they enjoy the NW mode but do not enjoy the Adventure mode. 
---
That would be like telling them to play something that they don't find enjoyable for hours, just so that they can play the mode that they do enjoy and be on an even playing field. 
---
Personally, I do not think that is a smart way to retain new players.
---
Exploring is nice. Often find I don't have enough time or not high enough level yet. But having to load multiple times is strange.
---
Once you have been to a location you can fast travel there for a few caps.  Vault 76 and your camp is always free fast travel.
---
LET US PET THE DOG, BETHESDA
---
I'll do that then I guess. Thanks for the advice.
---
I will check it just as sneak peak end, no wasting second of chance to rank up
---
Similar thing just happened to me! Legendary level 80 sheepsquatch came out of nowhere so I hid on the roof of a building and unloaded on it. I got it down to about half health and was extremely low on ammo and then it mutated and was back at full health. So I hid until it went away and then ran home.
---
Try the push to talk option.  That way it will transmit only when you press the key/button you specified.  I turn it on during the day when it's more noisy around the house.
---
You're Special does carry over. Unless they changed this overnight. 
---
You do unlock perk cards, however you do not unlock perk points. 
---
In regards to matchmaking, thats not what I have been experiencing. Im lvl 12 and have seen lvl 22s, as well as lower level 5s in the vault 51.
---
I know the master created the super mutants but I think Bethesda retconed the lore. I saw a loading screen earlier that said something along the lines of someone experimenting and putting the FEV virus in a local water source right before the Great War and that’s how we got these super mutants
---
I use melee when I'm going against a small group of enemies, or weak ones, and it seems to be working pretty well for me.
---
come here little ghoul, come down to this beautiful irradiated spring of youth and let's wrestle for some hours.
---
edit: They do heal from radiation right? xD
---
Which is a month too late for such a no brain feature. Text chat is even more basic and still missing
---
I’m going with the “it’s just a simulation” theory on NW.
---
Not anymore. It's out
---
If you never had some seconds in NW without combat them you might as well run around naked shooting the grass with a pipe rifle because stealth play a big role in NW :)
---
lulz, twatwaffle
---
Stuff like this have been happening since the beta. The number of legendary enemies is random but in the past it could actually get bugged.
---
There was a hilarious bug that replaced all the ghouls at the golf course with lvl 1 legendary eyebots and they all would drop lvl 1 legendary gear like pipe guns and wood/leather armors which is pretty rare to find legendary gear at that low level
---
Alright thank I will think about this
---
I haven’t played fallout since new Vegas and just redownloaded for the BR I have no idea 😅
---
So he DOES exists....wow !
---
Yeah i'd heard something along those lines before. I was using the term "IP ban" from my non-technical laymen point of view to suggest maybe they had more than an account ban.
---
?  What bug stops you from milking a Brahmin?
---
You do know that they can be only milked once a day, if you're trying the ones around Flatwoods maybe someone else has milked it today.
---
I feel like overwatch does it best, if you help kill someone it counts as an elimination, even if you do all damage. There are no assists, so when you see you got 30 eliminations, even though you only had half of those as kills, you feel much more satisfied about your contribution.
---
Because I still have hope it can be a good game!
---
Nice troll bro.
---
Especially early on, you can get 5-10 levels every couple of hours. I spent a lot of time farming events for rare outfits, and blew through lvl 50 before I had completed 95% of the main storyline.
---
It's hilarious watching nabs think this is fortnite and proceed to unload all their ammo and grenades on my metal bunker just to get the walls to barely half health.
---
Even more so when you place that bunker in the last ring and they're all desperately trying to get in but cant, and burn to death while your squad is chilling on a couch inside.
---
[downvote intensifies]
---
Yeah I get ya. I’m on a roll with NW since it’s only on for the week. Trying to get as many of the skins as I can since I don’t know when it’s coming back. Hoping I get level 60 by the end because I really want to see that Outcast PA.
---
Watch monty pythons holy grail and find out if witches float. "We are the knites of nee and we require a shrubbery''
---
if you build on the East side of the map, you will have to contend with higher level critters attacking your camp...or in certain areas, a nuke destroying it. 
---
Things in the Forest will also raid your camp, but they are generally lower level, so not as much of a headache.  Also, the Forest isn't nuked very often.
---
If you are going to sell, then high traffic areas. 
---
I'm on the edge between the forest and divide, so I occasionally get higher level ghouls/mutants attacking my camp.  Bad times for lower level players checking out my machines.  But I put my machines on the 2nd floor, so said critters can't direct attack you while you are shopping.   But the machine location does not help when the occasional SB  decides to attack.
---
I'd expect a pitchfork and a scythe at least.
---
Hmm...what kind of syrup goes best with a twatwaffle?
---
Do the NPC's come in the next big update?
---
Yep. Confirmed even in-game:
---
[https://i.gyazo.com/e4958bda23152b8c8757009b1d25da4e.png](https://i.gyazo.com/e4958bda23152b8c8757009b1d25da4e.png)
---
They should honestly rework kill rewards in general, not just for NW.
---
Even in the main game you get no XP or loot if your teammate kills anything unless you hit it. I really hope they can finally fix that, because its annoying as fuck and it carried over to even NW :/
---
u/lamarcs kindly have a look at this douche.
---
You can call us dumb if you want but using homophobic language is really unnecessary. Are you 12 or something?
---
Extremely, and with [plenty of proof](https://i.ibb.co/tq5k86r/See-Players.png) too. Here is an interesting screen shot showing players through walls, and aimbot to kill them through walls.
---
I am a bit upset over this.
---
I know for a fact that it works with turrets.
---
This is not only a really smart move because it will attract more fans, but I’m also happy because I’ve hardly had a chance to play this week!
---
Yeah definitely. Same here!
---
A man's relationship with his brahmin is a private matter :P
---
Too bad, that’s the price you pay
---
My experience with Nuclear Winter so far:
---
1. Wait a few minutes in the lobby
---
2. Wait a while in the map
---
3. Spawn in
---
4. Get killed in 20 seconds by the first guy I meet
---
5. Get 25xp
---
6. Repeat
---
What's this "Git gud" I've been reading so much about on the interwebs and where can I purchase some?
---
🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊!
---
Yes because it really makes a difference to all the spray 'n' pray and hiding in bushes lol.
---
Months of brainwashing by trashtubers the likes of yongnah has this effect.
---
This is why we were blessed with keyboards. I agree it could be optimized better but sometimes it’s just hard to key bind everything in a comfortable way. Take Fortnite for example great mechanics but feels more clunky on controller than a keyboard. I really think they need to improve equip speed and cut down on loading screens because overall I think they’re doing great with this update.
---
dick syrup
---
You aren't roleplaying anything, you're just being a spastic dickhole.
---
Yep, PA is a big negative, and marine/scout are just like I have no extra protection...must be a bug. At least I can unequip my white night 6.
---
Servers were dead all morning and afternoon east coast time when I was on the past two days also. Only three vendor camps including mine.
---
I didn’t want to get involved since I saw all the downvotes. But c’mon guys I’m sure this is a troll post. 
---
I don’t think it’s a coincidence this post was made after all the pot about the Brahmin should be in-killable by players (which I totally agree of btw) love a little life in my camp just as much as you guys
---
Wheres that?
---
Excellent! Nice job Steve.
---
That's just marsupial without the bonus carry weight and no negatives. It's neat, but not worth respeccing your toon for unless you wanted a high agi toon to begin with (like for a pistol or vats toon). It can give you a combat advantage when in towns/cities and whatnot, but it's totally useless in the forest. As hard as you are to shoot while jumping, it's even harder to shoot someone else.
---
They listened!
---
Every time I spawn in at my camp, a Yao Guai is there. I killed it, earned the XP from it, but still did not get the level up.
---
At least they know when they're onto a good thing.
---
Survival without legendaries is my dream game. Please devs, survival without legendaries in Fallout76 would be the best open world PvP experience.
---
Oh yeah getting cans of meat randomly. Thought it was on purpose when they fixed it.
---
Oh even better! I'm level 14 so I'm nearly there
---
ah, thats cool. They probably didn't expect that the feedback will be that good and don't want to lose out on more players.
---
Guess I gotta right that Dear John (Jane?) letter to VATS.  We had some good times....
---
The problem is they'll play it, most likely realize they actually enjoy some or all of it, but quickly realize they must hold the line and revert to blind memebashing.
---
Did not know that! Thanks!
---
I'd give it a few weeks until the hype dies down then I think we'll be left with a healthy mixture of pvp and pve posts.
---
True, I haven’t played this game in a month but I still had it downloaded and I tried once yesterday and it’s a huge improvement from getting one shot by sniper shotguns while in full power armor.
---
I don't think it needs an increase, I think certian objects, like do we decorations should take up less budget.
---
Sure, why not? I’d be surprised if there wasn’t one already
---
Any thoughts on how they could work this so that the space is persistent and always accessible?  Maybe do it like MMOs where it's not on the map itself, you have to travel elsewhere so it can have its own instance?  That way it could follow all of the building members no matter which server they're on.
---
60%? Damn. I have lvl 106 character and I have discovered about 200 out of ~350 locations
---
Every server I'm on is full
---
That wouldnt be wise on bethesdas part, but i have heard of refunds if you accidentally buy something.
---
Oh yeah, the mutation point really bummed me out too. I was down o around 200 sniper ammo at that point, and I spent around 110 or so more before the weapon broke... I was trying to cripple its leg at first so it wouldn't run away, lol. Ended up just shooting it in the head over and over.
---
To think that they can add more dialogue lines to companions with updates makes it really cool.
---
This can make them feel more alive. In previous games I felt like I know every line they can say.
---
By using melee.
---
Not really something I did as a joke, but some really high level came into my camp and purchased the issue of Tumbler's Today that increases the number of bobby pins you find in those little boxes of them. I figured he was either buying it for some challenge or just a magazine collector, because it sure wasn't worth the 15 caps he paid for it.
---
So it's not going away? Hell yeah!
---
I think you might be a bit curious about your sexuality bro. Its not really normal to shoot that word around like that. If you are its ok man just do you bro. No one is going to judge you.
---
The team on this game have really worked hard.
---
Hi there. You seem distressed.
---
Since I'm a friendly player who likes helping others out, you should come and hangout with me and my friend Beth(esda). We like doing fun things together, like petting molerats, and handing out free vegetables to noobs. If you're into it (and it **really** sounds like you are, maybe we can also hook up with some fresh faced studs from the vault later.
---
See you then! Kisses!
---
I most certainly am. Now step behind the curtain and strip to the waist.
---
Word
---
You don't mind if you win or not, I'm more of the type that really cares about winning. I've noticed that myself. I can't do much about it, and I've tried. Although, this one time, I did get into the top 2 with only another guy as my teammate, as the 2 others died. He was a high level and knew what he was doing, too.
---
Theres a terminal inside with the inhabitants of vault51, their proffession and status. It lists everyone as deceased.
---
That said, you do you man. Do it.
---
On PS4 it would need a custom app created by a hacker, but they would work the same way.
---
This just came out and on that note they can only improve on what they already have, give them some time.
---
I would assume that it's going to be handled similarly to workshops where it's server specific and not necessarily player specific. So something added by a player would stay until another player removed it or server gets reset.
---
.........motherf-
---
I like it but I'm soooo so bad at it. Still glad to see it hanging around.
---
It would be great on carry weight too because without the portable power perk its 10 units of weight.
---
Didn't realize shit could get attacked. Do setting up defenses help at all?
---
Please God no. I don't need the speakers pinging nonstop.
---
I also think they should take the Radium rifle out of the loot pool, or at least make it harder to get. There's not enough radaway to remove the rads. First fight and you can be stuck half-health for the entire match.
---
thanks guys, it does look like a good game, but I know my personality, I would probably get obsessed and log a ridiculous amount of time. trying not to get fired from work lol.
---
Ok.
---
No Problem
---
Badass! Thank you!
---
Looking for legendaries and using the purveyor in hopes of getting my dream pieces is what keeps me playing.
---
I see no G4ys in the lake [https://imgur.com/ACDzEhD](https://imgur.com/ACDzEhD)
---
Sadly, this is just a problem with the BR genre in general. PUBG is the same with the waiting except instead of dying within 20 seconds you'll usually spend more like 5 mins doing something then get killed by the first person you meet which makes it feel much worse.
---
There is a collective vender pool of 1,400 caps that rests 20 hours after your first interaction with them.
---
If you ask very quickly after buying and explain that it was an accidental purchase, they let you refund the item if you have not already crafted the CAMP item or outfit.
---
Yes I actually have had that problem as well
---
The easy way, especially if you have billings homestead (which is razorgrain city) is just to make your own, milk it, kill it, make another...  Easy to get the milk 10 Brahmin for the tadpole mammal challenge like that for example.
---
I sacrifice all the time and then watch my team win. Then I get nothing in return. They didn't think about that, go figure. Really wish this game was only made by Bethesda Maryland.
---
I read those voice lines in Bangalore's voice
---
I put up a sign... 10mm 10:1 buy single bullet and ill be right here.
---
Had a few ppl buy just the one and wait for me. Other few who bought 200ish and i came back and ploped down the remaining 1.8k
---
Not prefect by any means but its helped me unload some of that without dumping it on a new player who is using melee or rifles.
---
Killing always rewards the best exp.    Events are okay but you can do the event and it takes 10 minutes and rewards you the same exp as 3-4 mobs which could be killed in a fraction of the time the event took.   So if you just want to level and level fast you need to keep killing.    I think the best exp event I have done is the Scorched Earth event with the Scorchbeast Queen and it rewards 1000 or maybe 1200 exp for completion.    Everything you kill with that event adds up to a ton of exp due to the volume of mobs that enter the fight, but most events are not like that.     The actual event reward exp is the equivalent of a half dozen super mutant kills at my level.
---
Having said that I would just travel the map and get yourself into trouble/killing and hit the events that look interesting.   The rarer rewards from some events definitely make them worthwhile.
---
I blend both styles.   I do enjoy leveling but I really do not want it to be mindless.   At the same time my wandering does take me to locations that will result in exp.  
---
My final advice is to keep the rested buff up for 5% more exp.   Cranberry relish can also be used for another 10% and can easily be found at Aaronholt homestead in the north which wouldn't be difficult to get to at your level.   You do need the cranberry relish recipe and gourds but the recipe should be attainable from a player vendor with some luck and you could get a gourd from the Hornwright Summer Villa greenhouse (only 1 gourd there) to start a gourd crop to make relish.
---
Yeah i agree that update really made legendary farming more useful. Now i don’t have to throw away crappy legendaries from queens!
---
I haven't cleared any of them out anywhere near the 1,400 that I can remember.
---
*in JUNE OF 2019 were finaly getting the things promised to us in Novemberof last year*
---
For a bit? Oh how ppl forget they were one of the first to hop on that bandwagon of extreme microtransactions with horse armor dlc ages ago.
---
It’s here for everyone until Monday, but since it’s a pre-beta the mode will almost certainly return sometime soon
---
Vendors share a caps pool of 1400 caps which resets 20 hours after you make your first sale.
---
Game still crashes too much for me. Seems to be getting worse each update. Especially in nuked zones.
---
Brain bombs recipe eh, i found it yesterday in one of the POI's up north by red rocket.
---
I am kinda sad that the Adventure Mode is basically dead now. This week there were many newbies but after free play week ends I expect the adventure server to be mostly empty.
---
It's the scorchbeast. The rad suit offers exactly 0 dage resistance. Just the shock from the scream is enough to kill you.
---
bet same thing happened to him either
---
Try selling something, it may be a visual bug. I have seen vendors stuck on  0 caps before...selling something  fixes it if that's the case.
---
Never been a PVP fan so trying to get out of the comfort zone..
---
 I can't seem to hit anyone and just get mowed down so fast. Oh well, gotta practice I guess.
---
Sadly this is the only way, it's weird how you can't level up your character in the NW lobby.
---
No,  no they’re not.  
---
There should also be exclusive skins for adventure and survival.  Level 50, level 100, level 200, level 500.  Survival should only count XP earned in Survival.
---
The mods are my own which is why I have no idea why I was banned for nudity
---
Yeah I mentioned that. Totally agree that’s a good option as well
---
*spoiler alert*
---
BGS has been secretly testing new game software using us as guinea pigs. It's for an upcoming release called "Glitch Simulator: Wasteland Edition". From what I've seen since the beta, they've been cleverly hiding it and implementing it bit by bit with each update. I can't wait for the full release.
---
There's a secret way you can undo all the problems, though. Press and hold the button on the front of your console (it works for all consoles). Then all you have to do is walk away. You win!
---
Yeah, even if it wasn't accidental too. Maybe even a limited amount of refunds.
---
My light machine gun is around to eat all my .308
---
Prostate exam I hear
---
I want a Mr Handy Butler to tend to my camp, harvesting Food and Water and defending it.
---
Yes!!! This would be so nice. Had to go play adventure mode with a guy I met because that was the only way we could team up.
---
That’s really good. It would have been dumb to cancel it just when they were starting to get some good karma for it.
---
Would be nice if you had an animal you could have him or her at base to protect. Then you could start quests for just you and your companion. Like hunting or going to a location to help you find hidden stuff and dig up or find.
---
I’m serious: if it doesn’t make you happy, if you’re not having fun, if the challenge to come up with a winning strategy isn’t motivating you, don’t play NW. There are so many other ways to have fun in the game. Rebuild your CAMP. Go launch a nuke. Visit Biv. Just *have fun.*
---
Just read that on Facebook, good news!
---
Haha, funny you say that
---
Your teammates could award it to you after they finish game
---
this is a sign, a blessing.
---
fo76 is gonna pull a no man's sky
---
thank the todd, our lord and savior
---
Grahm has it not sure if its obtainable elsewhere.
---
Awesome news! It was going to feel empty for a while with just Adventure.
---
Still not how ghouls work. Even when exposed to the radiation of a nuclear blast, ghoulification isn’t guaranteed—most of the time it just kills you. And even when one does become a ghoul, it actually takes time for the transformation to complete. And even then, the afflicted don’t always immediately go feral. Sometimes they become intelligent ghouls who don’t turn feral ever or only after a long time.
---
That's going to be a hard no. They're finally getting people to come back to the game. Why take something that's helping that situation and essentially restart. That would a lot more time and energy spent on something that doesn't need to be. Just let them focus on getting the full version ready so we can move on and look towards wastelanders.
---
Wangst much?
---
Scorched would make much more sense.
---
Is the hellfire power armor just a paint or is it legit the power armor itself? Nuclear Winter is non-canon (from what I've heard) so they're free to do what they want, I guess.
---
To be fair even in the doc they said there are story reasons and they wanted to create an ever evolving world for years.
---
I think they at least had this planned from launch if not always. It just seemed like the inevitable step forward. We took back Appalachia, and now we're rebuilding America.
---
now way to share atomic shop stuff itdoesnt show up in the trade menu and when you drop it it gets destroyed bethesda made sure everyone who wants the item has to pay for it
---
I hope they don't remove it, I only got to play it once, before I had to go to camp
---
The problem is that it all happened during a free trial supposed to get people back / bring new players. I didn't play dozen of hours, only about 2-3 hours and yet encountered all those issues.  
---
you are missing the point. The fact that a ghoul can clip through the a building isn't game breaking. You can still kill it, it's the fact I saw the same thing happen in a video when the game got release and it's not fixed. If something stupid like that isn't fixed by now, how bad is the rest of the game?  
---
This isn't an early access game, but it feel like one.
---
It just wouldn’t be lore friendly
---
Then pick up a random item and try to sell it to them. Rarely will the vendors caps glitch out and show the incorrect numbers until they have to refresh.
---
No idea man, i got like 10 levels in adventure no probs, and it only popped when i actually got the level.
---
As long as it happens to everyone, I see no problem with this. It's a disadvantage for all players equally
---
That would be a shame. Most of the fun of building is in being able to come back the next day and admire your progress and maybe do some more work on it. 
---
It's one of the reasons the workshop mechanic confused me when I first started playing. I was like "wait you mean to say all the work I just did will get deleted as soon as I log out? (Or back then, equally likely the game crashes)". I "get" workshops now, but they're much more utilitarian. Set up some defense and an extractor then go on your merry way, don't stop to smell the soot flowers and set up a nice complicated home. 
---
But collaborative towns seem like you're building to be creative and roleplay, not with some short-term pragmatic goal in mind. In this case id really hope they give us a way to see how the town evolves over time. Id never want to build if I couldn't see it again.
---
I'm not entirely sure, theres a reddit post about the rewards, but I believe it just said "Hellfire Paint"
---
Hazmat suit is nearly invisible crouched in a Bush. I have people run past me all the time.
---
Yeah it takes too long to get back in the game.
---
It is not chucked up to no legendaries but the no VATS which makes the combat so much better. Please get that right.
---
keep all the acid/cloth/steel you find, hit up the lucky hole mine for lead ore
---
Commenting to see the answer. Also curious. If it's the actual armor I will play NW furiously
---
Can confirm this is accurate.
---
or maybe when the raiders destroyed the dam all the soil got washed away ☝🏼🧐
---
Naw I shoot then run. I might have been able to dodge that bullet coming from behind if I hadn't been like WTF is going on with this fucking scope????
---
I've had lag. I've had bugs. I won my first match due to having a nuke dropped on my  head and not dying of irradiation while everyone else did lol
---
Yeah, I get sad when I have to delete decorations to make room for my obsessive desire for mothman memorabilia.
---
If we have customizable dogs, I call making mine into Ghost. And he will be pet every day so be it!
---
There's a YT video of a person in power armor who just flies around the map, literally flying with feet never touching the ground, one shotting everyone.
---
Maybe we all just imagined that?
---
This pleases me - not because I enjoy the mode (I haven't gotten around to trying it yet), but because it highlights how much more responsive Bethesda have become reacting to community feedback since launch.
---
Thanks for getting back to me. I am enjoying the game so will probably get it!
---
I never said I do don't wanna die or get mad when I die. Dying, or stronger players has nothing to do with the problem. I think you didn't even read the original post.
---
Take the time to open a support ticket with them and they will be aware of it.  Relying on a mod to read your post and pass it on it not a reliable way of notifying them.
---
I agree they should be 2.5x bigger
---
I think bethesda geared this up in a way, that other players would team up and in effect, become the npc's.
---
Then the humans got it, and fucked it all up. No one seems to activly work together. I can get an impression, of where this game 'should be', but, alas, I dont think that will happen. so , yes everyone is pretty much solo.
---
huge improvement after they dropped pvp from adventure, but old habits die hard.
---
progression - well, I didnt go down the tourist path, made my own. found very quickly that there can be multiple ways to the same watering holes. I've still to uncover 40/50% of the map locations. You've got to kinda find your own way, one that suits you, depends on your personality and maturity, but theres something here for everyone
---
best of
---
OK, thanks
---
How much you want for it? Or you looking to trade
---
I can't accept this, i pop into adventure between every few NW matches throughout all day (up to 3-4am) and the worlds i join are always capped.
---
Praise the Three! Wait, wrong game. Hold on.
---
Praise Atom!
---
Yes. It's all server side.
---
Facebook. That's toxic enough lol. I didn't realize people still used it.
---
My experiences were amazing to read, sure, Bethesda, if you even did. I wouldn't quite say they were amazing, but it's kinda cool that Nookylur Winter is staying.
---
You still get rads when you're collecting water to boil, just not from eating the food.
---
On PC I have been disconnected crashing out of servers after a few minutes very often.
---
Can i get in on this?. I helped someone yesterday but he couldn't jump into water. Killed himself a bunch of times but just missed the water every time lol
---
has bethesda mentioned any bans for config file changes? wondering since i started during F2P week and want to purchase the game now. Just dont want to buy it and get banned a few days later.
---
I enjoy gathering 100's of molded plastic, and more recently placing intestines &amp; Halloween candy into the inventories of the bodies near vault 76.
---
They weren't gonna get rid of it forever. I figure they were gonna take it down for a few weeks to tweak it, add stuff like the extra maps and fix some bugs before bringing it back online. It wouldn't make sense for them to put effort into making the mode and then only use it for a week before dumping it.
---
I don't watch Fallout 76 videos, perhaps that's the reason.
---
Yes, I have found a lot of low levels coming out of the vault. That is good. More people will play. A lot of people already playing are doing NW. Or i am sure like me, a few rounds of NW then off to adventure mode to work on my possum badges.
---
This absolutely works. Super easy. I appreciate it!
---
Facebook in general is toxic.
---
I'll admit I'm guilty of this.  I've spent about 20 minutes a day in adventure, just to sell to vendors and snag the easy challenges.  The rest of my time has been spent in NW.
---
You can go play Fallout 3 right now and see the same thing a decade after release. You're missing the point. The free play weekend was to show off the improvements AND the additional content, and in my experience it's been a success. I've encountered loads of new players who are excited about the state of the game.
---
It does not even remotely feel or play like an early access game, and that's coming from someone with a thousand hours played versus your 2-3. There has been a tremendous amount of meaningful dev time devoted to the game, even if some minor issues that don't impact game play whatsoever still exist. That's called prioritization.
---
No one is saying it's a a perfect game, we're just saying you're full of shit.
---
I just can't manage that tbh. I only got into vending because it's set and forget.
---
Apparently I'm a large supplier of chems an heading items. That stuff sells more than anything else and I have so goddamn much.
---
FUCCC
---
If ppl want the tension of danger, go on Survival then. That is what it is there for.
---
This is a major problem with r/apexlegends as well.  Or at least it seems like it for PC players.  They've had to dedicate a ton of time to banning hackers with aimbot and wall detection.  No problems on XBO though.
---
Is there another list of the perk rewards?
---

---
 &gt; Same here, but at least now we have more time to practice! See you out there. :)
---
Oh I have. I just haven't received any responses, so I figure I post it here as well. Bethesda is very active on this sub.
---
How? I see it’s a smart move instead of having players complaining “Noobmaster64” (or something) is constantly killing quest npcs to troll on players or the one guy who is locking the dialog like how vendors are.
---
Hmm. Ok, thanks for checking in on that for me. We're already looking into reports, but this info will help further. 
---
I would like to trading, and sorry i forgot to say im on XBOX
---
new toys
---
Is the argument that players should and will buy things they cannot use because that's part of the game?
---
I believe ATOM shop profits are suffering from more than one reason that have nothing to do with me personally. I believe budget is one.
---
There are strong hints it is a Braun simulation.
---
A game without battle royale now is the impossible. Hell even sea of thieves "has one"
---
Having to come up with creative things to do in game at this point, besides handing out nukashine...
---
What does fusing it do
---
somewhat, yes, but not always.  
---
Budget issues aside, I have 4 turrets that cover the full 360 around my camp, as well as part of the interior.
---
Sometimes the turrets kick in, sometimes not.  Like when I had 4 molerats attacking the water pump - there was a turret not 4 steps away, and it never took a shot.
---
OTOH, the last time I was there and an SB attacked, all the turrets went live.
---
Argghh..that sucks
---
Survival mode should be perm death with stronger enemies and harsher food/sleep/disease penalties
---
Yeah !!! I was desperate cause I won't have a lot of time to play this week-end, but now .. .Rejoice !!!
---
The tadpole badge that you have to visit places is also still bugged. It has been bugged in challenges since before this update came out.
---
Nothing other than xp. You don't get anything special for winning. The storage box and statue can be crafted in camp. You can also apply the new skins to your guns in adventure. Or go in atom shop and select them, they will apply to your guns in nw.  They have other rewards too but they're higher up like pa paints. New icons too (atom shop)
---
More like a more cancerous 4chan with multiple bits of insanity and extremism sprinkled on top
---
Well i used to put some of nice survival stuffs to the bodies you mentioned to help newcomers :D
---
I prefer to play on my gaming PC, but when I see stuff like this, I always go back to consoles. Just nothing major or obvious there. At least I am on equal footing there.
---
Just remember to ask what level they made into and when they say "I'm not playing that game" tell them it's funny because now they have absolutely no say in the performance of the game.
---
See, you're welcome to not reply to me. 
---
But it is wrong, and you are a murdering thief who's decided that either (far more likely) abusing that resource to force someone into a PVP situation is fun. (In which case you are a griefer, and this is 100% of people who have challenged me at workshops, I've _never_ gone back to a workshop that's been challenged and seen harvesters or anything else). 
---
OR, (again, this has never happened, but sure, hypothetically) In game terms, you've decided that it's _worth it_ to murder me in order to gain control of resources I'm in possession of, and that's make you a sociopathic fucking murderer anyway. 
---
That's what you lot don't get. It legitimately does not matter _why_ you decide shooting someone to take their shit is "acceptable". It makes me think you're the type of sick fuck who keeps dead puppies in your fucking freezer.
---
Maybe make it a perk card? Then it would be like martydom in cod. :P
---
Yep. Now if we could just get Survival Mode to have the same features, holy fuck would the game explode with players. 
---
Ironic that people have been saying it since the very beginning that the game would be better off without these two features and got downvoted to oblivion.
---
Ive been doing pretty ok. Me and  another person fresh out of ten vault have been making the trek to get the black powder pistols. We have been doing pretty good.
---
Yesterday I timed it between leaving a match after it ended and getting back to the "select where you'll spawn" screen and it was ***eight minutes***.
---
Things will probably normalize a bit when the free week/NW trial ends, though I hope we still see a bit more low levels who buy the game and continue playing.
---
Nope. Your budget does not change, for any reason, at any time.
---
There is AGI perk card called “Frog legs” something like that. It requires 9 AGI, FYI
---
 There has been a sudden resurgence ~~in posts about~~ **of** players cheating in game. FTFY.  
---
Also are we talking about **NicePingForMe**? Because I've already seen several videos and posts, both here and on Beth forums, where this very player is explicitely cheating and yet he still seems to by playing. Devs can't seem to be able to ban him, we do not seem to be able to name him, while he's destroying the experience for many other players. Because Naming and shaming bad. Yup.  
---
Here, have a proof and censor you own post:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXRBmZ5ORAs&amp;t=5202s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXRBmZ5ORAs&amp;t=5202s)
---
A lot of times when it says object is floating you can exit and re enter build mode and it will place. 
---
As far as the roof issue goes I’ve noticed the game likes  camps built from the ground up. If you have a roof over where you want to place stairs you may have to remove the roof then place stairs then replace roof. Annoying. 
---
What’s pissing me off is the terrible selection of stairs and how they take up space. Also the fact that half floors no longer clip into the mesh stair floors. 
---
This worked during beta just fine and made them look 100% better. Also why the hell don’t we get half floors for all floor types. 🤷‍♂️
---
Way to double down, we need more like that!
---
By the way anyone still chanting that ranged weapons should get buffed?
---
It’s back up now, but it’s been down since before Nuclear Winter. Now I have to download a multi-gig update via crappy satellite internet. Now I understand how MODUS feels when he says the Kovac is a “poor conversationalist”. :p (because the connection is slow).
---
I mean a friend of mine, same level does 1000 damage while I do an approximate 200.
---
You must have lead a sheltered pre-free life. I’d see this every time there was down time between big events like Fasnacht
---
Yeah, I thought it was just me and I was doing something wrong.
---
level 60 to get the only paint set I want for my power armor in a game mode I don't enjoy? pass....put it in the Atom shop Outcast paint is one cosmetic I wouldn't mind paying for.
---
It will be better over the weekend I think
---
It'll probably even out a bit over time.
---
You can mutations from serums as well as radiation. There are a few perk cards that behave like mutations, such as one in AGI that is like Marsupial.
---
The purveyor was the biggest and best addition for me. I'm a solo player with no interest or skill for survival or NW, so the addition has boosted my already love for playing religiously.
---
Add the legendary effect on to the power armor, I should have been more specific
---
NO NO NO THE OTHER WAIST!!
---
... pervrt.
---
FO76's main game has actually gotten a lot better than it was. That's why I thought maybe, just *maybe*, they had learned. Alas....
---
Worlds are just flooded with noobs for this week, once the trial is up those that don't dig it won't stick around.
---
Lol **ALL** of my friends are on NW mod while I’m leveling up my brand new character..
---
Makes no real difference. You'll either be spraying everywhere with a 50 cal or hiding in a bush just like a level 200. The perks at this time seem to make very little difference.
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
No, just make tags.
---
Yeah I have tried different approaches with roof going in over and the game is also weird about a second layer existing without stairs which in a way kind of makes sense but on the flip side it should be left to the builder. And due to having a second story essentially I cannot remove the stairs without removing the floor connected to it and can't so that till I remove all the other floor &gt;.&lt;
---
Thanks.
---
Pvp without vats is great this is honestly how it should have been
---
You do know this is a videogame about surviving and gathering limited resources in the wasteland, right?
---
It has convinced people to blindly follow the rhetoric that it has been fixed and is free of bugs and glitches as long as they personally dont experience them.
---
So many new players this week! Just a lighthearted prank 😂
---
Also Flatwoods if there's numerous new players there. I drop care packages too and also into the Overseer's cache in the church, I'm not a total monster! 😁
---
10/10 wood buy one
---
The left... the right.  Extremists.  Everyone just crazy fanatics these days.  Middle ground and thoughtfulness is frowned upon with this generation.
---
A mistake to be sure.
---
While I understand that, you'd need to adjust to the fact that it would no longer be YOUR town, you're just contributing to the town everyone would share. So as it would be in a real town, unless you're the leader (which who knows how they handle that or if they even do) then there's no reason why what you want to add would be any more relevant than what someone else may want to add. 
---
This would make each server and each location take on a unique life of it's own by seeing how everyone else adjusts things in their various worlds. Some things may become standardized. We really don't know
---
This is of course presumption as no firm details have been released so this is all just what is being speculated by data miners and from what is pieced together from the scraps we have been told. 
---
Now a way around this, and what I think we may start seeing more of as towns are created is microcosm servers, meaning that you start having groups of people who work on the same server by consistently joining each others game, essentially always having at least one person on the same server at any given point. Then you'd essentially be able to come back to the exact same alterations you've made to the world until server is wiped and reset, unless some of this carries over. At least until private servers eventually become an actual thing.
---
What’s good about nuclear winter is that it provides a way to practice PvP without any risk, it’s really helping me get better at aiming in general too.
---
Don’t spawn in popular areas; you want to spawn near your group so you can meet up with them, but far enough off so you can load up on the local crates.  When you pick a spot have a secondary and tertiary location in your head.  If a bunch of enemy players ping on your load spot just bolt to the nearest empty location as soon as you spawn in.
---
The first fire wall is for looting and collecting; avoid combat
---
The second firewall is for surviving and gathering your team; avoid combat
---
The third firewall is for small skirmishes; kill easy targets and secure a route to the next collapse
---
The forth and subsequent firewalls are for finishing off the other survivors; get a combat shotgun.
---
Player vending was the biggest for adventure imo. It made the world feel more alive having people constantly visit your camp and being able to visit others and buy and sell.
---
ya, we won't see it during this beta run but I would hope on official release they push it out.
---
How would it not be lore friendly? Glowing ghouls literally radiate radiation. Or do you mean the whole "dying and then transforming" aspect?
---
It's alright, by level 25 you want to start using lever actions and handmade
---
I’m so excited!!!
---
Depends on what cards you have.
---
Legendary vendor and NW is best update ever in FO76 imo
---
In any given server normally only 1-3 player vending machines...selling....non legendary Weapons and Armor. Used to be fun. Now it's just boring. Oh well. ❤️
---
These loading times are too damn high!
---
Really amped you guys kept this online! Barely had time to play video games this week, so I'm excited to dive deeper into this mode
---
It's also exposed how bad I am at PvP without vats
---
Wow. That's just sad.
---
Hit me up my gt is gar627
---
Okay not for AI mobs then. On player characters
---
Just people trying out new stuff.
---

---
Good tips, thanks. Made it to 2nd place kind of like this. Didn't kill anyone. Still can't hit anyone. But got some placement XP.
---
people still use facebook? dinosaurs
---
I love how this game is friendly to new players :)
---
You do know that you came out of a vault with the clear intention of re-building the world, not _burning it down_ right? 
---
I don't get this. I legitimately don't. If you're doing it for "roleplay purposes" You shouldn't get offended when people don't like your anti-social evil acts. (and yes, killing someone for a fucking chunk of lead is an evil act). 
---
And if you 're doing it because it gives you jollies in the real world to have that little bit of power over someone else...that's a textbook symptom for being a sociopath.
---
Someone nuked the Queen yesterday. Three of us turned up: one very high level gut with a Deathclaw gauntlet, me (level 60) with my melee stuff as well, and a level 36 with a machine gun. And I think one level ~150 with an explosive something. Needless to day we failed. Failed Campfire Tales as well after no one showed up to keep the fire on while I swatted insects. I mean, a level 15 did turn up but I don't blame him.

---
is it good to keep around as a back up? I mean not saying ammo is HARD to come by but should you run low is it good to keep it around?
---
Yeah, this made me super sad as before the game released I wanted to build a weapon / armor crafting character with max int, which is currently pointless end game. 
---
The legendary vendor should provide a service to add stars to your equipment.
---
Thanks! Good you guys didn't bend to the bitterness of people like me, that hate BR's, you proved me wrong, that BR games/modes can actually be fun to play!
---
You can literally just make them essential.
---
well I am sneak and spec for max single shot rifle damage.
---
I didn’t mean it like that, I meant cancel as in End the demo.
---
You right
---
I know I sound patronizing and I’m honestly not trying to be. I feel bad that you’re not having fun in this new mode, and I don’t want that for you or any other player. Video games are entertainment first and foremost; when all other areas of life often suck balls, we all need an outlet to have fun or blow off steam. If video games are the opposite of that, and just add to stress levels, that *sucks.*
---
So, in summary, FUCK YEAH go play something else. Red Dead! Spider-Man! Pokemon! Uhhhhh... a classic? KoTOR!
---
Yeah no the sack of shit who one-shots the legendary isn't helping, dude.
---
Oohh
---
Yeah if you have nothing else as a back up, its still totally viable
---
I am looking forward to what they'll make up tonight now that people are genuinely praising the game.
---
lol ya and I just seen the Overseer list the Outcast paint is level 60.....not grinding to level 60 to get a paint scheme I love in a game mode I don't love lol.
---
How is it?
---
Opposite problem for me. I get all the XP and lvl up but get no notification.
---
It... hasn't tho? Not dramatically. Noticeably better. There is still tons of work to do and features that were promised to be added before it gets dramatically changed. Stash and Camp budget increases were very positive (backpacks also), and the refining changes of making Adventure Mode into a more purely PvE no-griefing game mode.
---
It certainly isn't (on PS4 anyway) excavator PA &amp; All Rise anymore.
---
I only got my own AR after 500+ hrs play, and it went straight into the scrip machine 😂
---
As others have said, I've been seeing more bloodied builds lately.  So, a nerf is probably looming.
---
See no Evil, Hear no Evil. 
---
a movie from the 80s. At one point two blind people have a gun fight a few feet from each other and it's as good as you imagine it would be.
---
Agreed, I think Bethesda have really nailed this one.
---
Many people have received the bag today.
---
I have only seen one. Within 4 minutes of the game starting he launched a bike, the teleporting around killed almost everbody on the server
---
I have loved this game even when it was a buggy mess, but the addition of NW has made me want to play it a lot more recently.
---
And this is how you turn around a bad launch :)
---
Awesome decision!
---
alright cool I am thinking about using a Gauss rifle as I get higher because from what I understand it looks like with a stealth/single shot damage build it has possible the highest sneak sniper shot in the game.
---
I personally don’t want perma death, but I definitely think there should be more penalties and environmental factors. Like temperatures and toxic air, I’d also like them to require new characters separate from adventure mode, and perhaps no legendaries.
---
Also I think the scoreboard shouldn’t reveal locations, but a way to track players would be nice still.
---
Well im not a pvp fan but im going to play it once i hit level 50. rewards are pretty tempting
---
Hi! We've seen this suggested a few times (not that your thread isn't just as important) and we'll continue to share this feedback with the team. Thanks!
---
No. No please
---
I got mine today too!
---
I see no foul play
---
VATS is still helpful for downing the extra monsters that come at you randomly. But, yeah, for someone as bad as i am, a little directional assistance would work wonders.  :)
---
Straight to hell for me as well, I'm afraid. See you there :)
---
Then the hunting rifle is great, and will continue to be great.
---
Fortnite and PUBG are anomalies, games used to come with multiple online modes, I think they still should, Fortnite and Apex are free, PUBG only has die hard fans left, games need multiple online modes if they are going to charge full price.

 &gt; Hi! We've seen this suggested a few times (not that your thread isn't just as important) and we'll continue to share this feedback with the team. Than...
---
You get XP and caps though, plus other rewards? I just unlocked the overseer’s chair plus the mega sloth icon for adventure mod. I can’t wait to explore more of Vault 51 too, now that I’m a high enough rank to start unlocking the backstory.
---
They said up front it was a polished up version of the Fallout 4 engine. It certainly has better lighting, LOD etc. than 4 though.
---
I always wanted to play Fallout with friends. I quit for awhile too, but it's got some much needed balance passes and QoL fixes since then, and I'm not abandoning it because I'm having fun.
---
I'd like to hear more detail on these other lies though, lol.
---
I like playing the game. I need lead, I'll go get the lead workshop. Oh, it's owned? I'll take it. What are you not understanding?
---
Oh definitely, I believe so, Tesla rifle is also pretty good  but doesnt have quite the punch
---
It’s actually good for PVE players since you can run 5 workshops at the same time.
---
Ok I can see that. But instance would solve the issue of dialog they mentioned too.
---
No point to talk to those kinds of people man, he probably works for exposure since he clearly doesn't like being rewarded for his work.
---
Ugh, every time I see a Bethesda tweet, [there is at least one tweet who just randomly bash them](https://twitter.com/WEIRDWOLFX/status/1139556447409364992), it's annoying.
---
Ahh. The days of doing damage to a play and not dying immediately because I suck at this.
---
I agree with your thoughts.  One of these days I'll last long enough to hurt someone in there.
---
Thankfully most of the PvP'ers have migrated to survival; I think they thought that PvE stood for 'Player Vs Everyone'! 😂
---
NPC’s will hopefully be “the update” that makes this game something special
---
10/10 Yong makes a 10 minute video bashing the bag.
---
yeah that is my big deal I am level 25 right now ZERO reason for me to play that game mode as I can't even equip 60% of the perk cards for it lmao.
---
 Good idea, would certainly make selling ammo a bit more practical.
---
Thank you so much. Yes, someone else just pointed that out.
---
Sorry, I did a search and a scan of the first few pages, but did not find it.
---
Keep up the good work!
---
[Don't turn the volume up now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q57BhKcbXHo)
---
Make up?
---
I don’t know if I messed up posting pictures...
---
Yeah, I don’t want to contribute to a circle jerk, but I think it is nice to see what has made the most significant impact
---
Can you imagine if they did the same thing in survival?
---
If legendaries and vats against players was removed from survival i would be so happy.
---
It's also implying that we will never have NPCs and another player in the same area at once.
---
Meaning these new town hubs with human NPCs will literally just be you and the NPCs. Which seems extremely pointless.
---
I think that is what it is as well.
---
I bet it’s 14 minutes just to really dig into Bethesda about liability
---
😂Lmao...  x so x fatal x  is my GT if you ever wanna team up in Nuclear Winter or lore explore
---
Some things have changed in regards to resource farming, but it’s mostly due to new enemy spawns. For example, the new Arktos event has a lot of honey beasts and Yao Guais, which drop a lot of adhesive and springs respectively. 
---
And in general, people have figured out the best ways to farm these things. Typically you want to be server hopping a place that spawns enemies that drop what you need. Wendigos drop screws, I think deathclaws drop gears etc etc. Much more efficient than trying to collect junk.
---
Personally, I haven’t really had to farm junk in months... I just seem to constantly get everything I need by killing the mobs and grabbing the junk at any relevant event I fast travel to. The only exception is screws, but there’s a good wendigo spawn up in the Mire... so it’s pretty painless. That being said, I think a big reason for this is that I’ve got all the good crafting perks at this point. Things like White Knight, Fix It Good, and Weapon Artisan go a long way.
---
By the way, any idea if the endurance from Adventure actually carries over to affect the health of your NW character? I play a sneak build with 1 END and I just can't seem to put out anywhere near as much damage as I take even if I hit properly.
---
Completely agree
---
Yes. A lot of things they claim on their channel are outright made up and false. Eg. the "players being outraged with 10% cap fee for vending".
---
Those and the I just picked up fallout 76 and its great and all those people at /r/fallout  hate all teh things.  I did sub here because during the first 3 months the game was terribly broken and i didn't need to hear the overkill loop of people bashing it and the countless youtube videos every few seconds at said thread. But most of the time here it isn't a discussion or an idea its just praising our todd and savior.  These actual noted ideas are things worth discussing and entirely why i am here.
---
Nice card
---
It's just a skin. Any power armor can use it.
---
I was always a melee xo-1 PA build, i have a bloodied mutant war drum that swings faster, and i have all the slugger perks. But i've seen so many people talk about 'bloodied builds' so ill look into it and adjust my build accordingly. I have like 20 perk points so i can afford to pick different cards.
---
"Watch the road!"
---
"Well, if that makes you feel better"
---
Good movie. Been a very long time since I saw it.
---
I used the hunting rifle as a sniper, it works pretty good, especially if you have armor piercing
---
Or just have it really small range
---
They will visit camps too. So there is an outside way :)
---
I just want a beaver companion. That’s it, that’s all I want.
---
Looks like it's here to stay. They gave the news this morning via twitter and updated their inside the vault article saying they were blown away with feedback and decided to leave the new game mode and update as usual.
---
Run in circles backwards while shooting. They attack in a straight line so always move to the side while shooting, a circle is a constant move to the side. Granted, you don't always have room to pull it off but outside areas are great for this.
---
Option #2 is get a vampiric knife. Knives are super fast and you can spam the kill button faster than the ghouls can swing at you. You can stab and rebuild your health faster than they can take it away in melee fights. I can stand in a group of 3-4 stabbing away like a madman and take them out no problem with no melee perk cards.
---
Bulking is only for items that are worthless sold individually. You can sell asbestos as is.
---
That's also all bulking is good for, aside from one or two components it's not weight efficient.
---
In fallout 3 I collected hundreds of gnomes and covered my player house in them. Gnomes = Life
---
Survival just needs lengendaries removed and it would be great
---
I hung 15Kg in it for 30 seconds, it’s sturdy but still floppy so I’ll probably make a wire/card frame for its shape
---
At least his chair didn't have to stop every 10 seconds for a breather. Bloody low ap.
---
"Its a bad game that's why I keep playing"
---
Alternatively 
---
"This game had a bad launch but was a good game so I stayed"
---
Once they bring in the other new adventure mode content ppl will come back . Like the vault raids that are comin soon hopefully . 🤞
---
We’re on Facebook and have a separate Facebook closed group. We haven’t expanded yet to Reddit but will soon. 
---
I can send you the links if you’d like. We have about 60-70 vets right now from 4-5 countries!
---
Give it a minute, I can't speak for the other players, but I've been away from adventure trying to get all those sweet sweet cosmetics from NW. As soon as I get all those I'll be back on adventure exclusively.
---
No, new cheats have come to light with the Battle Royale/nuclear winter mode. Aimbot, wall hack, and infinite AP are all a thing now. As well as people mentioning flying characters, and I also saw a video of someone beneath the ground picking people off. 
---
And I don't think the exploits you're referring to have been completely erased. I would say they've just gone underground and people/cheaters are just hiding it way better than before.
---
Assist exp sounds good, I'm also kinda wanting the person who downs a player gets the kill when they're finished off. I've had countless teammates go for the finisher just to get a kill instead of going for the remaining enemies.
---
NW is the reason why I bought 76 yesterday. $17 on Amazon!
---
practicing aim takes time and comes naturally, as long as you're comfortable with your mouse and its sensititivty (i had a super high sens for years and i got immediately better after reducing it).
---
the thing you should work on while you get good at aiming is the mind war, there is so much you can do to be good and help the team even with poor aim, have a look at the nuclear winter video made by many a true nerd, he's very poor at aiming but he gets a lot out of his presence thanks to being smart (for example using mines and explosives helps doing damage without aiming).
---
you could hack terminals to reveal enemies, you could picklock stuff to get better gear for everyone in the team and you can generally think well before engaging.
---
you need to be aggressive but not reckless, you need to think that your enemy is as human as you are, you are insecure of your playstyle, well, so might be they.
---
exploit their weakness, don't run in the open, take the long route, if you spot two teams fighting, let them kill each other and then kill the winner.
---
you can flank enemies that are fighting your team, if you are sneaky enough you'll get them by surprise at almost point blank range, not even stephen hawking could miss that way.
---
i know it looks a lot shootie shootie, but the thinkie thinkie wins here. trick them, if they know your position just place some camp defenses as if you're going to stand there and then sneak away to ambush them. there's a lot you can do but first you should stop solo queueing or at least speak with your team any time someone has a mic
---
we need a gnomageddon
---
Not sure I understand your settings. You have everything on low except textures? If that's the case, you want to do the reverse. Most settings can be on high, but your textures should be on medium.
---
I’m not sure, I’d like stats to make a difference in play styles, but my endurance is one so I don’t know.
---
Still feel like we should be awarded the same as a win if we sacrifice ourselves. Especially when it's the end of the match.
---
I've noticed that majority of people getting the kills have Marine armor and a 50 CAL.
---
Almost every other gun is dog shit for damage, which is fine, it creates a good fire fight. But often those fire fights are superseded by a member of their team mowing down people with their 50 cal.
---
I tried that for a while, then got lucky fighting the scrotchbeast and a high level went down.
---
It’s in Fallout 4, mod on Nexus. I downloaded it. Makes me laugh every time I see a duffle bag
---
It's a heck of a lot more enjoyable in a group where teammates can resurrect you. Gives you more leeway to screw up. This is true for all BRs.
---
I never thought I would be happy about a flipping Battle-flipping-Royale mode... But I'm so flipping happy at this news :D
---
I bet there were players that voiced their unhappiness at that.
---
What else?
---
The armor penetration mod on the knuckles is both easily obtained and an early game item in vendors. Hence the lower dmg. Otherwise it would be better than almost any other light melee in early game. (Judging from the base item dmg)
---
I disagree with what you're saying here, but I also don't have any advice other than "git gud" so it's really not helpful.
---
Yep everyone who did PvP in survival had moved to nw
---
Oh awesome! I might need to try that. Right now I have those giant cement barricades around my camp with the normal fences built behind that. With punji boards in front of the barricades. With my turrets on one of my houses roof I'm usually alerted right away if any thing comes by and I get rid of the turds.
---
Thankfully it's staying permanently and not disappearing on the 17th!!!
---
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
---
Die mutha f*cka! Die mutha f*cka, Die!!
---
Having one NPC at your camp isn't really changing the world though.
---
If you get that much per game, you’ll be ok with some duplicates, mister Battle Royale Master.
---
I haven’t contacted them about mine, so I still have time to do so?
---
That’s what it’s all about!  If you can survive to the top 10 each game, you are always going to make 200-300 more xp than someone who killed 10 people and died after the second wave.
---
So glad we can add our own 10% to negate that
---
You on pc?
---
Yah latest patch broke it from being so focused on making combat tweaks for their BR mode.
---
Firestorm and Blackout both have just as long wait times (if not longer). Waiting in the lobby is allowing everyone to load in as well as filling the lobby. Games such as Fortnite and Apex with negligible load times have vastly larger communities so it takes much less time for the games to fill and begin.
---
They should definitely add this. It would enhance communication so much, since most players either don't use their mic or have turned voice chat completely off.
---
I’ll do that! Cheers man.
---
I will draw the line at pets. I once went into a player camp and was treated by a level 21 deathclaw, and started shooting before I realized it was tame. Fortunately I didn’t kill it.
---
There are challenges for winning matches, and some conditional ones that reward perk cards.
---
It’s time related. I keep seeing fully lobbies.
---
Meh. I've gotten used to the fact I'm paying a cap per fusion cell.  it's just "the cost of doing business" at this point.
---
I WOULD like the option to break ammo down to lead, gunpowder &amp; brass(steel) though, maybe at 5:1 or 10:1  ratio.
---
I’m gonna have to play some adventure so I can reallocate some special points.  Level 9 frog legs is gonna be fun.
---
🤗
---
Great story!  I predict you'll have a hard time deleting that picture as every time it pops up on a loading screen you'll smile and think, "Yep, I did that!"  Keep it up :)
---
rifleman perks, tank killer, tenderizer, adrenaline, (concentrated fire, gun fu (broken at the moment), and better criticals if vats), bloody mess, mister sandman (at night)  you can really amp up your damage for any rifle.   
---
then pick the right rifle with good perks and you are golden, hunting rifle, combat sniper rifle, or lever action are really good 1 shot kill rifles at distance with head shots.  
---
i have an instigating explosive lever action and when all my perks proc on a headshot i can pull 3300 damage done on a single shot, the hunting rifle should be able to go a lil higher since i think base on hunting rifle hits a lil harder but its a lil slower on reload for my tastes.
---
Shutting off vsync in the txt file and messing w the nivdia control panel helps. You will have to Google the instructions. But most of all you need a better graphics card maybe a new processer.
---
You do. You get a perk card for winning 5 matches, and another for winning 5 while naked.
---
Thanks for the feedback! I'll add this to my notes.
---
Thank you so much for listening to your community!
---
Bulking other stuff is asbestos you can get amirite?
---
Dope news!
---
Yes!
---
Haven't even played it yet, I'm absolute trash at BR games and since I can't do solo queue (at least yet) don't wanna be a liability and waste a spot on a team somebody better than me could take... BUT... I love that it's staying for people who are digging it, and knowing it'll keep being around makes me more relaxed about jumping in when I'm ready.
---
Fuck yeah, Bethesda. I'm proud of the busting ass yall doing on this game.
---
FWIW, I've found the Gauss rifle to be a little less powered than in previous games, but I haven't done extensive experimenting. I use a lever action rifle as my main weapon - The rate of fire is nice and fast, and the ability to cut off reloading and fire off some shots is really useful. My base damage is around 150ish, with sneak perks pushing it up to the 300 to 600 range, depending on the enemy and target area. Also, .45 rounds are incredibly easy to find and craft. (Not sure what the electric carts take to make.)

---
 &gt; Thanks for the feedback! I'll add this to my notes.
---
A bit different than your suggestion, but I've suggested they add a T.E.N.T. object, or something like it. Make it so that it can only be placed outdoors. 
---
Basically, a standalone unit, gives you the ability to scrap and cook, and perhaps a sleeping bag too. 
---
I don't believe you should be able to access your stash, red rockets and train stations serve that purpose already. My motivation behind the suggestion was  there are situations where I am over encumbered but there's no crafting table in sight. Pop down your T.E.N.T., scrap, and be on your way.
---
Agreed. Also add player damage.
---
wasn't there talk of an ammo converter?
---
not yet but this summer its coming i would think august
---
they should take them out
---
Faction venders all have the same cap pool again.
---
I've noticed a lot of low level players lately too.  Works out for me though, I can run workshops and won't get mauled by a level 100+ players.  Although, I had a team of level 5's try their luck, needless to say, they didn't last very long.
---
Cool, but they still need to give something to the winner each game. I'm not gonna be psyched to get a single card for winning at least 5 matches. It's lackluster.
---
get the white knight perk level 3
---
Really? I thought it was only up until Monday.
---
The dying and transforming aspect mostly.
---
The game is similar to release but less bugs. Especially if new in terms of fun you aren't seeing much we didn't see except the br mode.
---
Yes but it was hardly an outrage. They were literally making a mountain out of a mole hill, claiming that people were quitting the game because of it. You get the idea.
---
I took some screenshots last night...  It looks like ZAX was successful; the question is what does he want it for?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/9cKcuLi](https://imgur.com/a/9cKcuLi)
---
Yes! I am a melee build, but I have a .50 cal and a mini gun I have souped up. It is hard to fight a scorch beast with a sledgehammer. Lol
---
Or the same advise but different, go solo start in a random spot hide in bushes inside the circle see how long you can live, i normally get top 5 and a couple kills, you get more xp for living long then getting alot of kills
---
That’s not too bad. Gives me some time to get that hellfire skin in NW lol and what happened to camp decorating?
---
I understand your confusion! Trying to remember what the settings are from work 🤔
---
Yeah no, special stats dont do anything but determine how many perk card points of each stat you can have. For example, on my sneak character, I have 1 charisma, so I can only have 1 chrisman card that takes 1 point (like creature crusher) and I cant equip a charisma card with 2 or more points required (like bodyguards). I hope this helps.
---
I'm not the moron telling people off for letting their kid play a game. You are.
---
Does the skin carry over to Adventure Mode, at least?
---
Do the Brotherhood quest and get the plans for the BOS sniper rifle which you can make levels 1-50!
---
I'd rather see people buy the game to play the mode, so that that sweet sweet dev money can happen and we get more in every mode.
---
Why wish for Adventure to die?
---
Stop picking highly contested areas.
---
Ha, I had the same experience. I'm level 90, but I have a lever action rifle and tormentor build, so I'm usually just trying to cripple the Queen's wings and getting rid of the mooks vs. doing damage. The only other guy who showed up was a level 300 with a heavy weapon, thankfully, so between the two of us we were able to bring her down - Switched to the All Rise once she landed to actually do some damage myself too.
---
I said it in another post but it's really a simple fix, either instance companions or have them be limited by people in your team.
---
Did you find the treasure from notes that were left? There are 10 from each region I believe.
---
Thanks for the tips, fellow wasteland wanderer!
---
But there are items that are exempt from the scrap all option that'll break down if you need components from them. For instance, if you need to repair something with bone or leather, and you have a deathclaw hand in your inventory, you'll use whichever component you need and the other component will he put in your inventory.
---
Clever Bethesda. 👏
---
Honestly everyone is trash at this game - dont sweat it. 
---
It's new and we are all trying to get out bearings down on what works and what doesnt. 
---
Theres also a lot of spawn in stand there till they die going on - and that's just xp from starting a game. I think that needs addressed.
---
What about charisma?
---
Maybe we'll finally meet the overseer.
---
Someone else told me, but thank you. I might never have found it (unless I googled), you know how they hide these things in the game. hehe!
---
Kinda funny that you basically have to get naked before getting into the power armor...lol
---
Question: do you use demolition for your IE lever? I’m curious is that gets you those high numbers too. (I have a regular instigating, and I can usually get around 1500 damage on the first shot. I have a similar build to you too.)
---
Don't shoot while standing up. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Indefinitely? Does it mean it's ftp now?
---
id pay 500 atoms for one.
---
This is cool, plenty of stuff to unlock.
---
(It does look a little battle pass-y though)
---
The only thing about special stats that cary over, is how many you have in what stat, str has no effect on carry wieght and endur has no effect on hp and agi has no effect on ap
---
Eh
---
Between the consoles would likely be fine but i definitely wouldn't want it with PC because of the different input methods, different settings and hackers, modders etc
---
It’s out for good now. They are keeping it in the game cause everyone liked it so much
---
Makes no difference being a level 2 character over a level 20? Of course it does. At level 2 you can only invest 1 lvl 1 card for each Special where as a level 20 could put multiple lvl1 Perception cards in if they have leveled it up.
---
I like the red arrows - three directional sound doesn’t work so cmon
---
You also didnt exaggerate.
---
and then place them all over my light wood laminate..
---
I just wanted a companion who could carry my stuff. Guess that's out.
---
As others have alluded to, every rifle in the game has its fans. At level 25, I stopped using my hunting rifle as much and switched to handmades. I found I could do more damage with two quick shots than the hunting rifle could do in one (taking the same amount of time, basically). The other benefit was that it was more durable and there's far less recoil. The problem is the relative scarcity of the ammo in the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap, normally where level 25's might wander around. 
---
I still use it but I have a more powerful legendary lever action that is my regular go to. Still, even a modded out non-legendary handmade is a great rifle. But after all the right perks are in place, it's mostly a matter of personal preference, imho.
---
It’ll always happen to the end of time. It happens on every game. Fallout 76 more because it was cool to do for a very long time. Yet if you look at any games tweets or fb post there normally some idiot with an anime character for a picture saying something edgy for likes. “Gah! I can’t believe people still play this.” “Oh I’m sure the three people still playing will enjoy this.” “Does anyone still play this?”
---
It’s in the how to be an edgy fuck handbook.
---
yes i do.
---
In my opinion, one of the most significant changes to the game have been the PvP overhauls on adventure mode. The removal of slap damage, limiting workshop PvP to workshop zones (no more getting ganked across the map), and the removal of camp griefing has probably had one of the largest positive impacts on the majority of the player base. 
---
It has changed the way many people play the game.
---
The x-02 hasn’t even been developed yet not for another 75-100 years at least , unfortunately the skin will have to do . They could of added the the captains cosmos armor set its lore accurate time wise anyway.
---
You mean the horse armor comes with nylon saddle bags?!
---
Hold my beer, i need to go find my pitchfork!
---
Hmm. I may need to try finding an IE lever...
---
Aren't people just camping Billings?  I would think 5 is the hardest.
---
Xbox my friend
---
Why does every game seem to have seducable companions? Is crap dating sim that much of a selling point??
---
Yea, and it would look dumb - everyone in pairs all the time. I hate pets (for instance) in MMOs because literally everyone has a little critter tailing exactly two feet behind them and it just looks so silly.
---
I honestly would have never thought to use other people for fast travel.  I feel so bad for all the invites I ignored up to now oops
---
There's no place like gnome.
---
At some point, I assume, powered turrets will be added, so you’re gonna need those sweet camps to power them.
---
ALSO CAMP RELATED:
---
Please allow us the ability to deconstruct things from the stored tab when placing our C.A.M.P. 
---
I made a massive camp that was really expensive and the game made it impossible to relocate the camp and never respawned it. 
---
I at least want to get the resources back so I can remake it, or individually regain all parts of the base.
---
Best news all day! My favorite battle royal. Absolutely love it!
---
You must have a shitty sound card. I can tell exactly which direction shots are coming from based on the sound.
---
PC here, 
---
I agree. I had so many issues with the beta that playing it now is a whole new and better experience, I do get frame drops in some areas but I'm usually at around 70+fps outside &amp; 100+ while inside buildings,
---
I've mostly been solo'ing it and I'm now currently level 35; started 1 1/2-2 days ago but I've been grinding and now I'm getting pretty great gear with probably 4 or 5 nuke things.
---
I've only had a few interactions with other players and they were all helpful which was great.
---
but so far, I'm already quite addicted to the game
---
Let me first mention that I beleive in development someone was told in a boardroom that pvp is the wave of the future and to make it work. That is the reason why griefing tactics took so long to be addressed and pvp updates along with survival mode were priority, esp pushing ppl into survival with the weekly op survival reward.
---
That being said they pretty much got rid off pvp in adventure, which coincidentaly got rid off alot of griefing...
---
Another nice change has been small but consistant updates and events like faschnact,sheepsquatch, and backpacks that keep ppl from being burnt out with the same old same old.
---
So I can get another condescending conversation from her? Lol j/k, I hope so, too.
---
Appreciate it man, wife just lost her grandfather and her grandmothers dementia is steadily getting worse, I would love you to message me when I can walk over with my wife to see your beautiful creation, it might even do her some good to hear your story as we walk your camp, I have your post saved on my phone. You are a very good man.
---
The Perk Card rewards are just when you get a random Perk Card to add to your NW deck. There are many of the same Perk Cards from Adventure but also some new ones as well. I don't have a list of those at the moment, but I'm sure there's a list of them out there somewhere!
---
No I mean like adventure mode camps
---
It doesn't seem to have any insignas, on the T-51b at least-- it really just looks like a black armor with some red painted on it.
---
The reason I asked is that I'm also using a 970 and really don't have too many issues with the game. Sure, medium textures look meh, and I have the occasional hitch, but nothing major. It's the 4gb of vram that holds it back.
---
I also use a custom ini to deal with things like disabling motion blur and such, but nothing that really effects fps.
---
Im not gonna lie here, your opinion is very wrong but you can believe it if you want
---
That’s the skin. You don’t get the bull barrel that way, you’re going to have to find that out in the world on your own.
---
Whelp, need to get to rank 44 ASAP I see...
---
*Head-beating into wall intensifies*
---
set your camp next to  lead mine hole. Use scrapper to get steel from guns
---
As an old man who can’t keep up in NW, I must say it’s been pretty lonely at my camp in Watoga.
---
It only applies to Adventure and Survivial.
---
They disabled it because it was exploitable. The first daily challenge was repeatable, place 4 camps get a perk pack enter a new match and you could do it again and again and again. I thought about doing a post about it at the time but didn't want to draw attention to it so i made a ticket to bethesda instead. Happy they are fixing it.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
very nice!
---
Interested to know if you've had any luck in testing if your broken armour still works the way you wanted?
---
I also have a berserker explosive double barrel shot if you're interested?
---
We had a 4-man team bunker up in the last zone by dropping a fortified steel base. Worked for them. You can actually build blueprints in Adventure and they carry over to NW, for quick-building defensive positions.
---
It’s not that extremely useful, but it’s great for getting cover when there is none.
---
I never used anything other than dogmeat. It was just so perfectly apocalyptic for your only real friend to be a dog.
---
Also when he bites someone's arm as you shoot them in the face.
---
I would imagine it would wind up being a Brotherhood splinter group with no Maxson via satellite uplink and no "priesthood" of sorts to keep them in line.
---
Vats could totally be adapted for pvp- if your accuracy had to charge. I.e. accuracy builds in vats the longer you have it activated, consuming ap the entire time, not just on the shot. That way a skilled player not using vats could defeat an unskilled player using it, but in a way that unskilled players are still dangerous. vats would mostly be used for surprise attacks. I think we all agree that a dual where both parties are using vats is kinda dumb, but that doesn’t mean it has no place in PVP.
---
Probably because under armors generally come with a stats buff. Could be wrong on the base under armors, but I thought they still came with a minimal stats boost.
---
Goddammit. Now I'm never going to play Adventure mode again. Or until I reach level 100 Overseer, whichever comes first.
---
How do you explain [this](https://gyazo.com/33ed2160346580ff090a64df692ffe63)?
---
So if someone romance with companion, he/she will stay in that player’s camp right? 
---
**evil laughter**
---
I have none of the games you mentioned to begin with.
---
I would've played MGS3 - the best game in existence - if I'd have access to the console it's in.
---
An I.O.U T.P note.
---
Yeah im fine with crossplay between the two console versions but i definitely don't want it with PC because of the different inputs, different settings and modders and hackers.
---
Okay I have another stupid question: what's a mat?
---
I've already won 2
---
Get rid of the “ez lob” for grenades. Shits annoying.
---
Its weird how it works great for some but doesnt for some. Also they never released the BR. Its out only a week
---
Hmmm... I'm sure they could block the buffs on them in NW without much effort.
---
That’s too bad. Due to PTSD I avoid Facebook and do not use it. If you get a reddit page let me know please.
---
&gt;[Updated June 14, 2019] We’ve been blown away by the reactions and responses we’ve been seeing all week to Nuclear Winter.
---
&gt;It has been so amazing to read all your experiences and see everything you’ve been sharing. There are so many incredible up-and-coming Overseers! Vault 51 is lucky.
---
&gt;With all the excitement and popularity, we wanted to let you know that the pre-beta sneak peek of Nuclear Winter will remain on and continue to receive updates, so keep sharing your feedback. There’s more to come! Thank you again for playing, sharing, and being the best community there is.
---
For those at work
---
Yes. Maybe r/fonw?
---
Still in the QA phase, I’d wager.
---
Im actually glad i gave it space so i could experience it like this.
---
I have a One X so 70 fps actually sounds like a dream come true lmao.  Its stable most of the time but stutters can happen when in dense citys but like i said its still playable so i dont mind so much. Back in beta the stutter was so bad it actually hurt my eyeballs  😂
---
Now that is certainly a grind dude, keep it up!
---
Not sure. Maybe a Dev will drop by and shed some light.
---
No, theyre keeping it out.
---
That's the way I'd go with it. Maybe have three unlabeled slots for, so say, combat builds, crafting builds and maybe scav/miscellaneous builds (lockpick and such).
---
Or give us that nifty camera!
---
I'm enjoying it while it lasts, people will come back after they get their fill of NW. I nuked whitesprings last night and got more kills, loot, and legendaries than I ever have before cause there were only a few other high level players on my server, mostly lvl 15 and below
---
Yea manage get down number of 4 to 2 survivals players use this silly method kinda works
---
No the free trial is still ending as scheduled I believe but Nuclear Winter is staying.
---
The game is at its lowest price ever so now is the best time for free trial players to buy it.
---
This is awesome!  Although, one question...when was it originally supposed to go "live" (or at this point, out of beta rather)?
---
They are rewriting lore as usual lol the x-02 was developed on the enclave oil rig after the events of fallout 1 and during fallout 2 ,  you first saw them in fallout 3 . Looks like Bethesda is at it again rewriting fallout lore but hey , we got the “skin” coming so that’s still cool.
---
What is the goal?
---
The answer:
---
There is no spoon.   
---
The goal is to have fun!  I don't chase dailies, rewards, etc.  I just learned the various aspects of the game, and now just do whatever I feel like.   I spend a lot of time in adventure mode now,  jumping from event to event, and watch for newbies in over their head in higher in the Mire or Cranberry Bog.
---
One day I may actually launch a bike, I think it's about the only quest I haven't done.  
---
Oh, and marsupial.   Nuff said 
---
Peace.
---
Unyielding
---
Or they could do what all modern companies do with modern games and rewrite dead end lore.
---
Don’t bother with this person they are one of those delusional circle jerking haters
---
Bolstering / unyielding
---
i think normal first shot i will hit around 8-900 ish, sneak proc 1200-1500. but when i kick in gun fu and better criticals as well as tenderizer and adrenaline warmed up and active i can get it ramped up pretty good, i hate that gun fu got broken last patch it kinda put a hamper on my damage output so i switched it out for mister sandman to get sneak damage to 3.5 times at night. kinda made up for it some.. well atleast half the time anyways.   
---
im thinking of dropping mutations altogether since i am only currently running level 3 adrenaline due to agility not being maxed, so have been on the fence about just getting rid of mutations maxing adrenaline, and then using better crits to max and see just how much damage i can peak at.  
---
but anyways i regularly pull 2200-2400 damage per hit most of the time.
---
Every year on Oblivon birthday bethsda boost up price for horse armor and they still get money
---
Nirnroot on the BoS Airship + Woman having visions of The Night Mother out on Far Harbor = Same Universe, different Kalpa
---
4 strength 4 stam canvas bag? eeeh uhh
---
I've heard this a few times today, can you possibly point me in the direction of the confirmation?
---
Right? I'm moving into a house this week and between work and packing my apartment I've made it to level 8 and that was by intense, focused playing
---
mat = materials, stuff to build with.
---
&gt;  (I haven't gotten around to trying it yet),
---
You should, It's tops
---
Yes, but on YouTube other players will see the hacker and also report them.
---
Retconning the lore is ok. It happens with all games.
---
+1
---
Nice, glad to hear this. NW is so surprisingly stable and balanced, I don't know what else they could polish with another 4+ months anyway.
---
Got mine, too!
---
There's hacks already for NW? Lmao that was fast.
---
I also got it without touching survival. The "milk a Brahmin" challenge worked for me in adventure mode, and funnily enough, a server hop would clear the milk challenge without resetting the 1/5 progress to 0/5... So milk + server hop 5 times got me the shotgun. I had my brother do it too and it worked.
---
Maybe in that case yes, but you cant dismiss the absolute mountains of shite that surrounding the launch of the game in which created the stigma around 76
---
Launch bugs
---
Poor performance
---
Uninspiring quest lines
---
Patches that reintroduced bugs
---
Countless exploits that ruined the economy
---
The wrongful banning of commited players 
---
The blatant mismarketing of the largest collectors edition of the game.
---
The lack of communication
---
The refusal to issue refunds after a certain date
---
Introducing microtransactions that affect perks ect
---
Dodgy practices in the atom shop
---
Leaking customer information 
---
I have had an absolute blast this week on 76, i really have. But all this stuff needs to be pushed put there for people to see. Its how Bethesda and the game will improve. Maybe some if it is fabricated, but a hell of a lot of it is not.
---
Unfortunately it appears that part of the perk is bugged for the time being. Wether or not it only applies to guns remains to be seen after it gets patched.
---
So the friends you invited to play with you are going to determine if you did a good job or not and award you unbiased "karma"?
---
Dont think you thought this through bud.
---
Definitely Unyielding for a Bloodied build.
---
Odd I have the occasional crash but not all that often, had a few more with the free week, but that is not as surprising with the number of new players right now.
---
I have 2 endurance and 295 hp in NW, how much do you have?
---
Huh thats cool
---
Hmm... Didn't realize they could mess up your camp. I accepted a low level player invite a while back and they just kinda followed me around for a while then left to do some quests. I discovered that I was getting some XP for them completing quests even though I didn't help them. I figured that was the reason people sent random team requests.
---
Ive got a tasty selection of heavy guns and melee, i went all heavy and rifles up to 50 then toyed around with melee and shotgunner
---
That's something I was wondering as well. Is it a specific time of day or 24 hours from the first time you use it for the day?
---
Nvm...next post down the list was it lol
---
I misread the first part as "this is not a smart move" and had my "No one is forcing you to play" response ready but then I re-read it.
---
Maybe sell those legendaries at super low prices. Fun for noobs and gives you a little trickle of caps.
---
I concur. It's more balanced.
---
They mostly ended up in fridges...
---
The ending of the words is JINGLE JANGLE.
---
It’s free week. Find out
---
Where u here that? Its just a teaser
---
The two times I’ve won so far have both been from hiding with chameleon until the last two and  then barraging the guy the second he walks to close
---
You're assuming perks are somehow gamechanging when in practice they're actually not. You could be high level and have all the heavy weapon perks but if you find fuck all but a crossbow then a level 1 with an automatic weapon will dominate you. The luck factor involved balances it all out. You also get way more xp in NW that grinding in adventure so you won't be level 2 very long anyway.
---
I know, right? They should really add an RPG mode more like the previous FO games, where we can just run around, kill mutants, and explore. They could call it something like, "undertaking", or "exploration", or something like that.
---
How you use your camp, if at all, is entirely up to you. Some people enjoy camp building as their main activity. Others simply don't bother. You can easily get by with simply building the essentials and going off to do whatever you enjoy doing in the game.
---

---
The shiny one with really hard edges and wrinkles is nylon.
---
I use the hunting rifle at lvl 80.  You can put a 50 Cal reciever on it and never run out of ammo again.     
---
 With the ammo perk you can make 180 .50 rounds per craft. 
---
It also hits hard if your sniper speced.
---
Him: "All 30 people who play"
---
Me: Literally has either 51 or 52 people each game I play.
---
Him: Who ya gonna believe? Me or your lying eyes!?!?
---
Check the bethesda twitter
---
New meta. Everyone share radsponge and ghoulish in your groups. Everyone fights naked near some rads duking it out till by by fire so farm. With the odd player walking to safety and winning
---
Just follow a team and Melee kill the ads. You get experience and caps for playing, so it’s another avenue to power-level your character. The perks are nice at higher ranks, but def not necessary to win. If you’re a half-decent shot, Marine/.50 cal can net you a win.
---
I plan on making them feel like they're obtainable but still like it's not just handed to them so they fell rewarded. Caps are the least of my concern.
---
Oh I love this with everybody in the new part of the game I can now scrounge around and find all the things I need. 😁
---
Yeah... I'll probably give it a go this weekend. I feel a desperate need for that Hellfire paint and the BoS stuff, and I get the feeling a lot more themed stuff is gonna be in NW, so might as well get on the grind.
---
So wait, tho... you're saying people are just AFKing matches? That actually gets people XP and rewards? Cuz yeah, that needs a fix, for sure... if that's what you mean.
---
I unlocked the handmade plans and make them at their lowest level and sell them for dirt cheap, for the newbies.
---
What? No, no, nonono...
---
What I'm asking is to be able to use EITHER boiled or purified for cooking food, not exclusively purified.
---
CONGRADULATIONS
---
I’m pretty concerned about how nobody’s cleaning up the dead bodies.
---
Thanks for that, now I’m debating getting a second copy for the wife to play with me. This BR has been a blast so far.
---
Interesting. Thats cool
---
Camp building is mainly there for fun. All you need is your crafting tables, and a stash box. Maybe a bed and an instrument for the status buffs and a vending machine if you wanna sell stuff to people.
---
I think so. Sure i spent 1hr + building my camp, but it's not like I'm rebuilding it everyday. I made it months ago and never touched it again. Make a decent camp you're happy with and that's it, no need to constantly build.
---
And why can't we keep the team we're on? Why do I have to friend someone in the social menu just to try to get them in my team the next round. We should be able to stay on our team, and load right back in, automatically unless we press quit.
---
I'm only level 4 😂 had no time at all.
---
😂 😂 😂
---
What kind of build do you have? Where do you have ghoul problems?
---
For me, I wear Excavator PA (266 DR) with medic torso mod and I'm a rifleman with Handmade rifles, full health. I have no problems taking out ghouls at the Whitespring Golf club. They tend to cluster up and if I cripple one or two, they move so slowly that the other ghouls behind them pile up. Drum mag &amp; headshots and they are done. Usually 2-6 hits per ghoul. Yes, they hit hard, 5-10% of my health, but that's what the medic torso mod is for.
---
hey buddy, just a reminder that those canvas bags arrived today and would you look at that, its perfectly timed with the free week when new players will be deciding to buy the full game or not. looks like I was 100% correct about the canvas bag release being timed to maximize game sales and that social media will be praising the bags.
---
I would love for you to show me someone being negative about the bags as you predicted :)
---
I normally hate BR but.... damn is it fun you can just feel the fallout in it
---
That's how BRs work. BR's don't take any longer than 20mins most of the time, and they're always fast paced.
---
Only 8? I thought it felt like 10 LOL
---
^seriously
---
I want to try this - just spawn in the middle, slap down a fort as a decoy, then hide somewhere nearby.
---
But I always just spawn wherever my team spawns.
---
Yeah I totally agree with this, it would be awesome to have a peaceful center to gather at as the HUB or whatever it may be with player stalls and some new NPCs and stuff, hell yeah!
---
I'm the other way around, I randomly bumped into like 5 or 6 people either in the military or previously in. 
---
Could expand it to Reddit for sure, not 100% on the process or what's involved. 
---
I would be interested in joining the community, about to be back visiting the middle Eastern resort overseas but I (hopefully) will be able to play some off and on while there.
---
Every junk item in excess of 120 is useless
---
I agree. Lore wise in fallout I let a ton of things go because that's just how fallout has been. But it's a pretty big mess after 76 and 4.
---
I tried selling the low level legendaries in my machines for cheap to help low levels. High level players bought them for scrip. Lol. Now I just gift them out.  
---
Your play style reminds me of what I do. I built a responder camp near Helvetia and give out aid, ammo, and equipment.  It's a good way to play and help the long term playerbase.  
---
Good job man!
---
Camps can be whatever you want. A junk pile with a few workbenches? A fortress of turrets and doors? A couch in the woods? A nice normal house? All possible. Use it how you want.
---
That's something they should specify in the update readme. I'll be pissed if it resets every time I check to see if it's refilled.
---
Goddamn, those masks and helmets! I love them! Looking forward to getting those!
---
I'm a lvl 138 and just don't respond to them. I'll team up with my friends but most of the time I'm just running by myself and like to keep it that way. If I run into a random person I'll say hi on the mic, ask if they need anything then go on about my way. If they need help with a quest I'll team up and play bodyguard but that's about it.
---
I have leveled up from XP gained in Nuclear Winter, but I get the notification way more often, like every three or four rounds. Bit disappointing to log in to Adventure mode and not see it lol
---
OMG Nuclear Winter extreme: play as a ghould when you die, you get back up as a ghoul and start chasing your attacker
---
Uhm depending on where you are in the bog you may want to place turrets ontop of your house. We sometimes get roaming Super Mutant Hordes and the occassional Scorchbeast flies up north every now and then.
---
??? Chameleon mutation/stealth boys ???
---
On another note, anybody struggling audio wise? In other games like PUBG I have a pretty good sense of where sound is coming from, but i have no clue where people are shooting from here. Footsteps also seem to be non existent, as two people in fully clad power armor snuck up on me -_-
---
All I basically did was throw done some wood platforms with crafting stations and vending machines, about six of each crop, and one of the prefab houses. So, you don't really have to craft much in this game if you don't want to - there aren't really quests tied to it. (Bonus: One of my buddies is obsessed with the crafting stuff, so he took a look at my setup and added a bunch of stuff himself. Soooo, if you have a friend playing that likes that kind of stuff, they can add to your camp if you're on a team together.)
---
My endurance is 2 and I have 250 HP
---
Lol, I thought no one wanted this mode? Funny how things change.
---
Then the other team wouldn't be able to use you as bait!
---
If you see the wastelanders pictures, you see that vault that opens up and isnt part of the raids, that might be what youre asking for but no confirmation yet
---
CONGABADULATIONS!
---
This. Sooooooo much this.
---
Milking the Brahmin counts in adventure mode, and it stacks. I got the gun in adventure by milking 5 Brahmin on different worlds.
---
I sell ammo for free, anything I don’t need, that is
---
No one on the surface survived Appalachia. At its peak, the Scorched Plague annihilated or converted all human beings. Ghouls, which are immune to the plague, were either killed off by insane extremists or went completely feral.
---
The only reason the Vault Dwellers survived is because we were in a sealed environment, isolated from the outside world.
---
24 hours at a specific time of day. For me in Central US, it refills at about 9PM.
---
Yes, please, this exact idea was suggested months ago and still is an awesome idea
---
Kind of like enchanting in Skyrim. You have to destroy the item to learn its effects. Then you need a certain skill level to add them onto other items, and even higher skill level to add multiple effects. And some weapons/armor can handle more enchantments than others, or different ones. 
---
But still, the problem remains that if its too easy to get exactly what you want, youll get bored faster and stop playing. The best thing Bethesda can do to help us get better items faster is to add harder difficulties with a higher concentration of multi-star legendary enemies. But i think this is coming with the vault raids.....someday.
---
These people downvoting you are prolly just BR sweats jumping into 76 honestly. Slowing it down would keep it a battle royale in every respect, but make it more unique. Something these people in the thread don't seem to grasp.
---
Yup that's what I want
---
I would like to have 1 machine in the long vendor hallway at whitesprings.  That way you can still have your fancy camp setups and 1 machine in the "player hub" at whitesprings.
---
You don't even have to build a base. There's a lot of benefit to just making a mobile CAMP you can drop as needed.
---
Same here!  Lol
---
It's called a Retcon and to be fair, Fallout is best when it get's weird and leans heavy into it's retro-futurism aesthetic.  It's smart for the business and the game overall. Comics do it constantly, no one cares. Movies have done it a million times, no one cares. 
---
Why can't Fallout doe it? People would care, but ultimately if it makes the games better, the hold outs will come around.
---
Yep, also it would be a good way to give stuff to noobs: giving them pre war money so they can afford some emergency ammo or meds.
---
Thank you. 9PM in game or real time?
---
I always kill insult bot and prize bot
---
1 more on the list : don't watch us die just to take our loot &gt;_&lt;
---
I guess so! I seem to remember some Bioware fans being disappointed when they found out you couldn't romance anyone in Anthem.
---
Then why have perks?
---
It literally says outfit next to outfit names lol
---
I always loved turning codsworth into a tank with Automatron. Sentry bot legs, sentry arms, but leaving his mr handy body and center eye
---
Well they could maybe make an exception? Not trying to crush this idea, I like it.
---
When you start turn off team fill
---
You really need to stay off the home shopping network. Got away reasonably cheap, come to think of it.....
---
same thing i did until i was like 120ish maybe 140.. 180 50 cal rounds with ammosmith, pop on super duper and when it procs you get 360 rounds its extremely easy to keep a really high stock pile of 50 cal rounds.
---
Because the only toilet FO76 allows you to place is broken and filthy.
---
 Shoot on sight. At least I get some steel. ;)
---
where do you find the statistics data for places discovered ? of course I made a vague aproximation. but just by looking at the map i’m pretty sure they are lots of places.
---
There's one cabin in the mountains by whitespring that has like 4 or 5  of them
---
when I find clothes out in the world I have to pick it up and look at it before I can see if it's an outfit or under armor
---
Under armor has to be upgraded to give stats. Otherwise it's the same as clothing.
---
\- More content - the gradual addition of quests and new areas has been nice, especially for those who have done it all.
---
\- Better events - once in a while, new events with good rewards are added in.  I loved Fasnacht best, but there's a lot out there with the new quests coming out.
---
\- New modes - survival and Nuclear Winter (battle royale) are a nice change, once in a while.  I mostly play Adventure, though.
---
\- Lots of good customization items in the Atomic Shop, and ones to be found in the world.  They often give out free things too, and those always freshen up my little CAMP home.
---
\- My one criticism is that to me (playing for a while) Atoms are harder to earn than they used to be (I thought the old rate was fair).  Now challenges are really hard in my opinion - weeklies, dailies, and the achievement ones.  I wish you could spontaneously get more in a renewable way, or at least the store was cheaper by a good amount, then I'd spend my money.
---
I'm definitely going to shoot this guy if that bill is brought up again...
---
Yeah.. True 😂
---
Console players have sound from TV bro. And when people run away, they are like fucking sonic the hedgespeedhacker.
---
Turn off auto fill when you select NW and you wont have a team
---
It’s not trying to be like COD. It’s trying to be a Battle Royale game. There are many BR games, and most have been around long before COD’s Blackout (Fortnite, PUBG Arma mod, PUBG standalone, Realm Royale, BF V Firestorm; just to name a few).
---
It’s supposed to be fast paced with little time to linger anywhere. Start with nothing, scramble to get whatever you can, survive as long as possible until the end. That’s the BR formula.
---
The biggest difference between FO’s implementation of BR vs the others is their spawn system. In the other games, you can see where other players are going and can alter your start point before you hit the ground. 
---
In FO, it’s a blind gamble, and you’re almost certainly going to start next to other enemy players every match. That does make FO a little more hectic than the others if you’re the type of player who would otherwise prefer to find a more peaceful starting point.
---
Hey you know what would help with Nuclear Winter, what would be nice to bring up with "the team"?
---
On PC in Fallout 4 we could simultaneously use both controllers AND Mouse+Keyboard. That was really super helpful because although 90% of the time you can walk around and do your thing with the controller, sometimes things get a bit hairy and the ability for me to grab the mouse and get in a few quick and accurate headshots was the difference between life and death.
---
Now in Fallout 76, we can't use both at the same time -- it's one or the other. In adventure mode that's not a big deal. We've got VATS after all which kind of makes up for those of us who prefer controllers for whatever reason. Even in survival when us controller dudes are up against the more accurate M+KB guys we've still got VATS to level the field a bit. 
---
But in NW, the playing field between controller folks and M+KB folks gets way more skewed. Without VATS, when a controller user meets a M+KB user, the controller is going to lose to the M+KB almost every time. Now if you can't add back in VATS (which is fine) maybe you can make it so we can use both so that when I'm going sniper vs. sniper in the last little circles o' death I'm not immediate at a huge disadvantage because I've got a controller and she doesn't.
---
Welcome friend!!
---
They should make it like Overwatch where you can press a button to stay with team and any teammate that agrees will be on your next team
---
Someone who gets it!
---
Stop sky-diving and get in here!
---
I could understand server crashes with more players but not game crashes
---
-2 for plastic. -1 for canvas. Community never forgets
---
overdue.. its all interest.
---
Good choice on going seedless on those grapes!
---
Things on this list that are fabricated (but before that, Launch bugs? How is that an outrage issue? Which game doesn't have them? Also what do you mean by uninspiring quest lines? Isn't that a very subjective thing?)
---
1. Poor performance  (only if you run on a potato)
---
2. Wrongful banning: Juicehead and YongYea made a shitstorm about the 900 hour guy and then it was proved that he was definitely cheating. People who said they could reproduce the ban by his method were all found to be lying.
---
3. Dodgy practise in the atom shop? Like, what? Selling stuff?
---
4. Leaking info: No actual info got leaked to the public.
---
5. Microtransactions that affect perks: this is a flat out lie that you made up. Not even Juice or the others. Just you.
---
6. Lack of communications: they literally communicate one on one with players regarding most issues. Weekly Into the Vaults. Posts with majoy issues get replies and they get fixed in the next or so patch. How is that lack od communication?
---
7. Countless exploits: so, like, literally every other online game? Also not to mention that these exploits get patched very quickly as soon as they are discovered (usually within a day or two).
---
So basically 90% of the claims you made here are false or non issues that have been blown out of proportion. As is the canvas bag thing. Pretty sure 99% of players don't care what bag they got, and the bags have been given now anyway, so again it's a non issue. People like Yongyea will hrab at any straw to create a controversy, because that's their business model. It gets them views. They don't give a shit about whether you get a good game or not. It's easy money for them: read a few posts out of reddit, make a few outrageous comments and blatant lies just to make your video cross the 10 minute mark so that it gets monetization  (hell, Juice talks about making a *cooking video*. Lol.) And voila: profit with zero effort.
---
That sound perfect
---
I'm just a little outside of Watoga. Ive been there for quite some time and have only had trouble with a couple muties and a few mirelurks. I see dingy bois every now abd then but the robots in the city aggro them abd they leave my camp alone.
---
39 caps for being the second place team is hardly worth it and I wouldn't consider 660 XP power leveling anything......and as for the rewards the outcast paint is the only thing that has my interest not playing this mode till 60 to get it the mode isn't fun enough for me to justify it.
---
A good mechanic to prevent people
---
Suiciding for tactical advantages would be:
---
The longer you survive, the higher lvl creature you respawn as. 
---
For example:
---
Survived 0-20 sec = molerat/radroach/bloatfly/bloodbug
---
Survived 21-60 sec = mutant hound/mongrel/feral ghoul/stingwing
---
Survived 61-120 sec = super mutant/scorched/mirelurk
---
Survived 121-180 sec = yao guai/deathclaw/mirelurk king
---
Survived 181-300 sec = mirelurk queen/scorchbeast/hermit crab/fog crawler
---
Survived 301-480 sec = scorchbeast queen.
---
Btw: the type of creature should be randomly chosen from your current tier or lower.
---
This means that if you survive 350 sec, you're not guaranteed to become a scorchbeast queen. 
---
You can also become a radroach. 
---
This 100% eliminates the possibility of tactical suicide.
---
 LOL. Its your machine that's crashing. Not the game, runs great on mine.
---
Look at your challenges- you can get a ton of "free packs" on your first couple games. Take pictures and delete them from vault 51. Drop your camp 10 times, just spam it. And build defensive structures. Spam those.
---
As long as you are in caution the stalkers effect is active. Tbh its kinda a trash legendary effect. 
---
Keep using your scrip on 2* ranged weapons.  That's the best deal for sure. You will get a good one eventually.
---
Good enough reason
---
Oh my goodness it takes two seconds and the name tells you. Plus most of them are common sense “miner uniform”, surveyor outfit, drifter outfit, you can literally tell
---
Ok, then I'm probably wrong on that. Wasn't sure if the base UA had a small stats bump or not. In my defense Im 650+ hours in. . . So it's been awhile since I've been down that road lol.
---
Well BGS owns the lore so they can retcon whatever they want about it. But its not like retconning things is inherently bad or uncommon. Some of the biggest money printing franchises in the world retcon stuff, Marvel, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Dragon Ball, etc. If you have the legal right to do so and its purpose allows adding to dead end lore than why not?
---
Witcher 3 had brothels, and you could romance all the major women characters. Seems to be a big thing.
---
I've not come across this issue. There have been plenty of wastelanders in adventure when I hop on.
---
This is exciting, but not as exciting as my girls face when I tell her.  A lot of sacrifices were made this week, I regret nothing.
---
That makes so much more sense thanks
---
I didn't know I needed this until now. I want to come back as a SB lol omg that would be amazeballs
---
Was looking at that last night, goes down to level 15. Nice idea.
---
Many people prefer to focus on their build and/or equipment so I frankly think you will. Provided one of thosr speak to you. 
---
Think of your camp as a free FT point. Put it down to a spot you frequent whether it's mission based, you sell there, grind legendaries, nuke there frequently or just scab/harvest resources. 
---
You can keep all your benches amd stash boxes in storage and pull them out as you need them.
---
Agreed. A friend and I have gotten somewhat of a system down for the first circle of the game that usually lets us ambush a few folks but after that we're still flying by the seat of our pants.
---
Reason why this sub isn't "toxic" is most of us here are fan boys, we originally had a lot of people saying negative things here before but most have quit or got refund for the game and have no reason to come so its basically just us fan boys. Please keep in mind though a lot of people quit Fallout 76 and in return quit coming to this reddit, I remember the good days when posts could hit 20k likes and now we hit 3k if we lucky. 
---
So in short this sub is basically the same as an anti vax sub(echo chamber) where they love cheering on parents who use essential oils instead of taking them to the doctor while the general public looks at with disgust.
---
I don’t understand the companion idea if they don’t follow you around? Like to we head back to them and they give us scrap they scavenged or do we just get to talk to them?  Not really a companion at that point
---
We dont know, no roadmap yet.
---
Thing is, if I quick start the game for a match, wait 5minutes, then get killed in 5 minutes, then have to wait 20 minutes, chances I keep playing enough to git gud and not die in 4 minutes are low.
---
It sucks.  Wasn't that common for me until this week.  Happened 3 times today.  Probably all the free week users making it happen more.
---
sweet
---
You can join in with 2 people?
---
Did they ever fix aiming? Or is it just the potato game engine?
---
The scoped combat rifle is really nice if you have bad aim because it’s high fire rate doesn’t punish you for missing. Snipers are definitely good in this, especially as a player who generally doesn’t have teammates who communicate, I’m able to stay behind and help my teammates without adding to the chaos of team fights,
---
Mozambique, here.
---
I can't agree that they redeemed themselves. The hate is understandable.
---
They launch a new game mode, and there are still problems in Adventure mode. 
---
You can still get stuck in areas on the map.
---
Still can't complete certain challenges cause they are bugged, for example, shooting a rad stag with a syringer, or playing an acoustic guitar.
---
Landscape rendering errors.
---
Enemies still get stuck in T poses, and have weird glitch animations when attacking.
---
Enemies dropping a totally different weapon and ammo than what they are shooting.
---
Invincible enemies.
---
Falling through the map still happens.
---
SBQ loves to go beyond the southern fence to never come back in to the play area to defeat her.
---
Dead bodies instantly disappear, and if legendary, you don't get dat legendary loot.
---
Randomly getting stopped in your tracks from invisible non damage attack.
---
I'm sure I can think of more, but I think this is good enough example of why people are trashing it, and shit like this is understandable for people who want the first game mode at launch to be perfect before adding any other shit on.
---
For future reference: nukacrypt.com
---
WOO HOO!!!!  LOVE IT!!
---
Don’t know why ur being downvoted he has a good point hopefully the wastelandsrs dlc will actually bring life to Appalachia and not two areas cuz that would be extremely disappointing
---
My friend and I have won some matches so that's boosted us a bit more than average
---
I think it depends a lot on the "start" you get. I've got unlucky and been triple teamed by players with good gear within 30 seconds, and I've also not seen another player for 5 minutes and been buffed up as a result. As they refine things, it would be nice if they could offer like a "balanced" start mode, where each team of four gets put in an area equidistant from other teams.
---
My last game I played I won - the circle ended on a bridge and the other team was under us. I think the other team had to drop and killed themself as the circle closed to 100% fire.
---
It was pretty funny.
---
It’s a NW specific perk card
---
That's my guess. Seems like after a new patch the game gets buggy and disconnects happen more often. They usually fix those quickly though.
---
Portaloo? That’s new to me. 😂
---
I'm saying it could be more streamlined than that pretty easily by putting (outfit) or (under armor) next to the name so you don't have to check it
---
I've already thought of this issue which is why it's not going in the machines. None of it will actually. I'm going to put up letters and signs. I'm also going to lock my door and put a machine in there possibly.
---
Yes, I get it, it’s a BR, I’m simply suggesting try something different to make it unique and stand out. Slow the game down a little bit. Does that mean hour long games? No. I mean let people loot a bit more and build up their characters and sprinkle in some more creatures. Give it a more FO experience. Add some more RPG character development and strategy on building your character
---
It’s better for people who don’t have great aim, it’s low damage and high fire rate don’t punish you for missing a shot. I like the lever action too, it retains high damage but doesn’t have a really slow fire rate like the hunting rifle.
---
I'll post them when I go home. Didn't expect such quality answers so quickly, GG!
---
There’s a lot of magazine collectors out there, 15 caps is a bargain for him!
---
No one uses people as bait anymore. Plus what about when you die from falling or something? It forces you to reload or waste even more time. The game mode already takes ages to load.
---
Battlefield has the best set up for this I have seen target has 100% hp there is 100 points to be had (unless he heals then more points) you do 80% but some finishs him assist counts as kill, and other people get xp for % of dmg done
---
It has no place in pvp other than to serve as a crutch for players who cannot aim. It is literally an aimbot.
---
Lol
---
Please no with the diseases lol.
---
 I like having legendaries in the game, wiping it would give it a better feel I think and I think just making changes to maybe what legendary effects stuff can have or the rarity of legendary equipment or rate that enemies appear being changed.
---
Would just be nice for a clean slate environment without people bringing in their stuff or characters from adventure mode.
---
Could also make people want to play (or reward playing) by having account based rewards potentially in the new mode or things (equipment, camp stuff, etc) for your account.
---
Vats is fun. It’s fallout. Without vats it’s a fps br. I still play nuclear winter a lot but I want VATs- why? Cus it’s fallout and makes it different than other br. Don’t hate me for saying this- I got a lot of hate saying fallout should do a instanced PvP mode and look what happened. Instead- how could you make vats balanced in the BR mode? Don’t cry how it’s OP in survival cus it ain’t. Just sneak and put your gun away and you can be  VATs. Hmmm....
---
100% VATS and legendary effects should be null on non AI targets in survival
---
Im using heavy weapons and eventualy melee. Sugestions for legendary effects?
---
I havent seen anything like that
---
The turrets don't work perfectly in terms of killing people, but they're awesome for alerting you to someone else in the area.
---
Spend time exploring the world just discovering all the points that come up on your HUD compass. If you come to something and the enemies are too high a level then move on, if you think you can take them then fight your way in.
---
I did this and leveled my character to 50 before doing the quests (except for the first responder quests...did those).
---
Doesn't take as long as you would think to get up pretty high levels just wandering around the world.
---
I turn off tracking for anything Im not actively following
---
Good to know.  Thanks all!!
---
Optimized? No. 
---
But working on my second character that is focused on subdue-perks for robots, creatures, and monsters. Wood armor maxed for stealth and focused on pistol use (15 in Cha, Agi, and End)
---
Sure, I lose the XP from killing but so long as I hit lvl. 50 with that toon...I already have 164 as a main.
---
... but as far as I can tell, wouldn't the trains be upside down? there's no rotation within the circle... it seems very likely to murder people on a regular basis.
---
So we’re going to have actual companions aside from npc s ? This is more than expected !
---
No worries dude! Welcome to Appalachia!
---
Added!
---
How long do you think a BR match last? Anything you do in a BR game is lost at the end. If a match was an hour long, that’d be far too much of a time investment into something that resets.
---
Also, there are really only two ways to slow down a BR match: increase the time between storm circles and/or increase the map size (without increasing player count). What would you be doing with all that extra time? Exploring? How many matches do you think you’d play just to explore before you got bored? I’d bet leas than 10.
---
I never did pvp because legendarys arnt a good thing. No skill need with legendarys, but im loving nuclear winter
---
Thank god I don't play battle royale or scrubs might call me hacking for basically doing what gun does " firing multiple shots out of a rifle and hitting people extremely far away ".
---
One that we won last night we hid in the funeral home until 8 people left last night and then kind've snuck up on the remaining players. Cowardly but still successful.
---
For some reason we kept singing Johnny Cash's cover of "Won't Back down" while we waited
---
Idk why, don't ask me why.
---
Being a huge fallout fan I didn’t play it because I didn’t want to be disappointed. Trying it this week and loving it. I came across somebody who gave me a few things. Made me a burning barbed sheepsquatch club and Spear. This game really has a great community and I really appreciate everybody helping make this game that much better for everybody. You people are the real MVP keep up the good work
---
They could easily give player characters in Survival mode a permanent status effect that suppresses legendary effects from equipped gear as long as you are in Survival mode. I agree about VATS and PvP, but idk a simple way to handle it without just screwing up people who built their character around VATS/Crit perks.
---
They could also tinker around with stuff like:
---
\-Addiction and Disease % chances
---
\-How often you have to eat/drink and sleep maybe?
---
\-Cooldown on stuff like Stimpaks/Stealthboys
---
\-Ammo weight?
---
\-A special item to heal crippled limbs
---
\-Nerfed mutations
---
\-Increased enemy damage but also decreased enemy health/resistances to account for loss of damage from no legendary effects 
---
\-Special Survival mode only perk cards?
---
That's on them for playing with TV sound. 
---
Let the console peasants have their red arrows. PC masters use head phones or kick ass speakers.
---
Ah, I did not know that. I'm glad they changed that!
---
Let me build a robot like in FO4. No need to add dialogue trees or anything and it’ll be a good resource sink with the ability for them to add even more cosmetics.
---
We got the "Well Rested" XP and "Well Tuned" AP regen buffs... petting the doggo should give an "Unconditionally Loved" HP regen buff.
---
It’s just a combination of people trying out something new and the huge numbers of trial players. Servers are still full, more so now than ever, there’s just a lot of low levels taking up the slots. 
---
After this week at least 2/3rds of the trial players will disappear, restoring a lot of balance. 
---
After a couple of weeks the shine will wear off NW and players will start balancing it into the mix of activities rather than spending every minute in it. 
---
A few weeks to a month and the trial players who stayed will no longer be low level, again restoring balance.
---
im not a fan of building either, i have three characters i play on, a 282, a 135, and an 82. All three are camped in the exact same spot, with a house built as a big square box allowing me all the work benches, a bed (for well rested xp bonus), an instrument (for well tuned ap regen bonus), and a couple water purifiers and some corn and gourds for food..  i doubt i ever finish the challenges for camp building and so on simply because i find it dull and tedious, i would rather be out killing something.  
---
find ya a spot, build a box, and never worry about it again.
---
Pretty much my experience, mixed with the long in between wait time between games was kind of off putting. I was also hoping for a little more depth to the game play rather than run and gun and who gets the luckiest looting gameplay
---
It's an interesting way to put it and as a fellow child of the 80s, it is kind of like role playing as that favorite action figure.
---
I will upgrade at some point but probably not just for fo76. Everything else I play runs pretty well.
---
I'm east coast and mine seems to reset in the evening between 7 and 9.  That's my rough guestimate.
---
Only if you want god roll three star stuff. You can find one star unyielding or bloodied for pretty reasonable prices. I sell any one star items I find for 500-800 caps in my vendor.
---
On my last FO4 playthrough, I intended to go full Lone Wanderer... then I met ADA and we became BFFs. Seriously being able to completely customize your own robot companion was great.
---
It's pretty easy to ignore them, until the scorchbeast shows up...
---
Or maybe something in between?
---
Exactly.
---
Yes, that's it. I can be hard at a low level and solo, but once you get another person or two helping it's easy.
---
Awesome! Thank you Bethesda.
---
"Adventure" has a nice ring to it.
---
Power armor has never been the be all end all in this game. Legendary armor has always been better, imo.
---
I *like* the diseases. I honestly do.
---
I never cure them. I play them out. Sometimes it *really* sucks.. .others, are fantastic "role playing" opportunities. When my "Cannibal clown" got parasites, AND had speed demon... I just saw it as a 'red rage" moment. Started attacking everything, eating everyone... it was super fun.
---
Great news, been grinding waaaaay too hard to try and get my level up and those rewards, now I can take my foot (somewhat) of the gas a little!
---
This is exactly why after the last generation I left PC for console gaming. This sort of behavior also happens on consoles too, but in my personal experience it doesn't hold a candle to what I used to run into daily on PC. It's a real shame.
---
Fight in 3rd person maybe? It’s made a world of difference for me. Went from getting 0-2 kills a match to averaging at least 4-5 kills a match
---
I think you have a winner! You should send that idea to Bethesda.
---
Not sure but I think if you’re still marked as (hidden) then you’re not in combat yet. 
---
If that’s the case then you should be able to keep getting 100% vats till you enter caution or danger. 
---
I run melee so I know I’d only get the first shot with a stalker weapon before I entered combat
---
They purposefully keep pushing horse armor. They don't wait to die either
---
Doesn’t mean you can’t try something different? Look at fortnite they turned into a smash hit because they tried something different with their building system. Fallout could add more RPG and character development and create strategy on how you build your character up.
---
Or just make another BR like the rest
---
Good to know.  I failed last night with only one item remaining and I couldn't find it lol.  Will try again tonight. Thanks!
---
I seriously doubt they will feel empty; 24-34 player servers fill up easily and feel full easily regardless of people playing nuclear winter and it will continue to bring new people to explore the entirety of fo76 ;)
---
You and your kids should form a raiding party and grief your wife.
---
Welcome to appalachia baby!
---
Oh watch out, we got a bad ass over here.
---
I think most of us can tell that a rifle is not able to down 3 people within 1 second from half a map away while shooting through walls. A video showing this was posted yesterday.
---
I’m playing at around 90fps outside and 130 inside but I still get FPS drops down to the 50’s in busy areas.
---
The insecurity you have for the things you love is mindblowing, 90% of the points i made are valid no matter how hard you try to fabricate that they were false.
---
Criticisms are best way to improve bad things.
---
And for the whole bad optimization if you run it on a potato. I guess every console is a potato. I have the One X and it ran like shite.
---
Fantastic optimization.... only a good half of their player base is on console.....i guess theres no need to optimize it for them.
---
Hmm if you’re against using bloodied my advice will change pretty significantly. Note: i run bloodied without power armor 100% of the time and I only struggle with the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
 Serendipity and nerd rage wont be much use to you, so if you don’t plan on running at &lt;20% health then you should shoot to stay near full hp. I have made some recommended adjustments to your build planner based on my personal experience playing melee and quality of life perks I have found to be useful. 
---

Are mics enabled for your team by default when formed or do you need to manually setup voice?  I’ve enabled me mic but nobody ever responds...don’t know if it’s me or they don’t have mics.
---
Pretty sure Everquest dud it first.
---
Peace, tranquility, and absolutely 0 punches in the face. Very much a VIP experience!
---
0
---
Ya it used to hardly be worth doing because the food spoiled so fast.  Now it's a nice incentive to complete it!  And the hoppers don't "eat" your items anymore! Lol!
---
If it is what i think it is, you need to get the key to the mansion from the mine then go through the mansion to get the key, it may not be that but if my memory is correct that's what it is
---
That would be pretty hilarious and majority of the diseases I don't mind but I don't like parasites or dysentery, already tideous enough with food and drinks and then it puts it into hyper drive, I'm only trying to carry so many melons on me lol 
---
And addictions lol, I think the only time I have gotten addicted is when I was trying to for junky testing.
---
A lot of different ways they could either modify survival mode or add in a new one that is similar.
---
&gt; where do you find the statistics data for places discovered ? of course I made a vague aproximation. but just by looking at the map i’m pretty sure they are lots of places.
---
Uno
---
Wrong. It's a good thing.
---
This is not just for Fallout. A lot of PC games have hacks. It's primarily why I play certain things only on console now.
---
Without 2 shot explosives I can kill people. Almost level 30 with almost 50 wins in BR yet I can’t kill a single person in Adventure or survival and I’m level 105
---
I don’t think the “nuclear winter” update is technically here yet though! I suspect near the end of the month we’ll see another update really kicking off the nuclear winter section of the roadmap—vault dungeons!!!
---
i came in hating it but actually enjoyed it alot
---
The story of vault 51 is on the wiki if you want to read it. Its pretty interesting.
---
This is my first time playing BR thingy, I am just wondering what kind of mechanism there is so that opposing teams don't start up next to each other? I mean that map seems so small where you can put your dude and it seems really full when the red ones are added there too (which I presume are the other dudes from your side?)?
---
Yea my cousin had the same card with a quad core amd chip. He stopped playing because of the lag. Good luck tho.
---
Really Fallout has done what most DONT - if you google and read the FO bible - then you should be able to see that. While I don't think myself its a retcon it is a bit huge stretch in 76 how they tell you what and how. But again It is still better that they even did that then a complete go F you and the lore and retcon total willy-nilly.
---
That stinks, but better than nothing. I really wanted one to tag along.
---
Aww that sucks, you will get get it I’m sure.
---
I still am. Tassyn is bae
---
I feel like they nerfed the budget after this NW patch. I moved to a new base and built everything from scratch. Maxed out budget and fit everything I wanted perfectly. Logged in after NW was released and couldn’t figure out why my base wasn’t showing on the map as a vendor. Eventually discovered that I somehow became over budget and had to delete about 3 turrets just to get below the “new” limit just to make my base reappear as a vendor.
---
The reason I dislike BR is the whole one life concept. I much prefer traditional deathmatch or team deathmatch with a pool of lives your team uses up then it's over. If you basically ha a second chance to keep playing after you died I would be more into BR in Fallout.
---
He did say they were being deliberately vague about it, possibly because a lot of this is still up in the air.
---
People complain about 76's graphics, but you always have to consider the worst case scenario in this game.  24 players, all wearing different things, all occupying the same space.  The game has to handle that.  Now, if you expand that to include a bunch of companions, you can imagine the potential issues here.
---
It’s a legendary drop. RNG
---
Unfortunately there is not. There is also no jet pack
---
Ya, sometimes it's just easier to get on your mic and find friendly players that actually want the help.  I suspect that many of the times people ignore my help is because they are high level guys that just created a new character. Lol.
---
I just bought the new billboard from the atom shop.  I'm really looking forward to putting messages on it.  So much easier than trying to use walls and such.
---
I'm in the same boat, very busy week and going away this weekend so I was only able to get a few games in. I'm glad it's sticking around because I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would and can't wait to get a real play session in.
---
Nope, explosive is a legendary trait. You can't add it yourself.

There is a mod for fallout new vegas where u can build vehicles but thats it. Nothing vehicle wise at all in 76.
---
If you like base building then build at some interesting locations. There are many scattered around the map. You can even build near preexisting structures and use them in your build.
---
I use to have actived the missions from the same zone, but navigating the quests menu is sometimes really annoying. This way you only have to move your mouse to be sure you are following the correct directions in a faster and more intuitive way.
---
I'd actually like to see a small budget camp that we can throw down and blueprint for NW. Something a bit more mobile.
---
Oh, I know. But it wasn't in my inventory in the Nuclear winter game.
---
Wow, great news but I hope some people return to adventure!
---
They should genuinely just de-tankify the enemies and remove legendaries. Or at the very least move them to a different mode to not upset people. The ability to go super saiyan whenever your health drops low or fire infinite explosive rounds without having to craft them just kills any ability to have viable varied builds that aren't the METAtm.
---
Romance has been a big element of The Witcher since the first one. Since the first page of the first book. It would be weirder if Witcher 3 didn't have romance options.
---
That's some destiny emote-peekin memery right there.
---
Yeah, I agree. The only reason I ever build new equipment anymore is to grind the mod recipes.  And given that armor's scrapping mod recipe drop rate is so low, that's a painful experience.
---
You made the mods and you are unaware of any nudes but got banned for a nude mods...
---
It could, although Dogmeat's follow distance seemed quite flexible and natural in 4.
---
lol this thread
---
Danke.
---
Or a charisma buff. I'm allergic to animals so petting the dog would give me a HP de-buff.
---
Yes you can. I have a friend that has the spot you’re talking about.
---
Im on xbox, and mics are set to auto by default. Which means only my team can hear me, no area chat in NW. I think  when no one else is talking, its a mix of no mics, and being in an external party chat. When i play with friends we usually go into a party chat. I always invite the randomly added teammate to the chat group. Sometimes they join, sometimes they dont. 
---
I always have my mic on when playing with random teams. I call out enemy locations and loot boxes, and most of the time it’s obvious im being heard, but theres not always a verbal response, sometimes just an emoji.
---
I’ve been having the same issue since release. Sent my pc spec to Bethesda and they said my pc should easily handle ultra settings but it doesn’t. There doesn’t seem to be anyway to fix the problem. I’ve messed with setting and it doesn’t make a difference.
---
I updated my support ticket like a week ago asking about it and got a response just yesterday that it had shipped.
---
Are you Bethesda account banned of Microsoft account banned?
---
For me, each subsequent hit with my Furious Handmade showed the same damage number but the health bar decreased ever increasingly as expected. How did you shoot; i.e., shoot once, look away, wait a few seconds, shoot again?
---
I did see someone who was in power armor but tiny. It was like a child in power armor and probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in 76.
---
You get more xp by surving longer and getting higher placement than fighting. I've gone up over 10 levels on a +50 char just doing NW.
---
It's been about 50 levels since I was last through there, but IIRC, that's an exit ... 
---
and you'll still need to find the key to open it from the inside.
---
No, you're right. I think what happened was the first time I looked at it, it was all 1's because of a loading lag or something. Then I looked again after a few levels and they'd changed, so I thought it was random.
---
It's a plus when you've been married for a while. You can get some action on the side without the wife getting pissed. Or if you're a true gamer, without breaking out the Oculus and the Fleshlight.
---
Even better you can romance the dogmeat
---
Remember though, a coffee and a donut at Slocum's Joe is $30.  I assume inflation must have been rampant in Pre-War America.
---
A magazine subscription, remember that there was a hyperinflation before the war started and you havnt payed in 25 years ...
---
Yea this is pretty much the same for me. I tried to utilize low health perks in NW but I feel like you blow through the nerd rage benefits when being gunned down in NW. so I run master commando still but switched out nerf rage for master shot gunner to get that +40% damage which is huge! I still run iron clad and it seems to help a lot. So I think trying to balance defense perks and damage increasing perks is vital to a well rounded build. I even threw on the faster reload for big guns actually. The .50 cal is OP! Being able to hammer down a hundred rounds is huge! If you get that and marine armor... forget about it! It’s probably the most successful set up I’ve gotten in NW I think.
---
All sounds very reasonable. Let's see if it works out that way.
---
I feel they got really educated about this with 'Evan' early on. The most difficult enemy to kill during the beta and shortly after launch.
---
Sounds like I'm in the same boat as you then. I like to spend hours trying to shove my base into the most impossible spots and I don't want to have to go through it all again, if I even can. This is the second camp Bethesda has ruined this week for me. I hope they address both issues.
---
The greater good.
---
Thanks!! Hopefully I'll see everyone in the wasteland this weekend.
---
Aww man thanks tho
---
Do you need to claim them in the shop?
---
fyi it's better not to plan a build in NW since all of the perks are random. I'm lvl 30 (and completed almost all of the challenges) and I have only 36 of the 70+ cards since there's a chance to get duplicate cards, which is completely dumb.
---
Nuclear Winter is just the name of the season and the game mode. There will be other stuff too, like the vault raids and legendary players.
---
Now go on, git!
---
https://youtu.be/tt2EXWzMV18
---
I wish I could agree.  I want this to be true to my experiences with them this week but it's not.  They all come down off the mountain straight off NW and come straight into my camp to attack me while I am at a bench or sleeping or trading.  My most memorable encounter has been the level 6 who blew himself all the way across my camp with a land mine trying to place it under me while I was at my tinker station.  He then had the nerve to ask to be stimmed.
---
Hey, now, this isn't Crusader Kings.
---
Exciting!!!!!!!!!
---
Nope, they unlock automatically
---
Kill assists would be cool
---
Well back that covan  trailer up I'm moving. It's only down the creek but is a dream location. Thanks 🤗
---
I guess. The game still just isn't in a position for pvp. Movement is to sporadic and arcadey with no weight. People just strafe back and fourth and spam jumping. Id rather play this then survival, but I'd rather play adventure than either.
---
Oh shucks, you're embarrassing me.
---
Nope  they unlock automatically
---
As someone who really isn't a fan of battle royale, it reallllllllllllllly works well with this game
---
I had a feeling that might crop up 😂
---
Events, going with a party and have the perk card that increases your xp gain. Also do the event “feeding the people” you’ll get canned meat and that increases your XP for an hour as well.
---
I can understand that, if there's an event going on I don't think it's necessary to have companions. When roaming the wastes by yourself in the middle of no where that's when I see a companion being a good thing.
---
good point, but at least i'd know what other people might find. i just found out that they can equip higher stimpack effect and faster stimpack effect, i wonder what else is there to be found in the game
---
My wife doesn't follow me around all day. She does her own thing and we meet up back at the house every night. But they said they can join you in certain instanced areas. So, like when she and I meet up for lunch. Seems very reasonable and realistic to me. Never liked how McCready and Piper neglected their family just to follow me around 24/7.
---
Yea definitely not the full version. More maps are coming.
---
Sound like you want adventure mode its the one where they hold hand in hand
---
I kind of like it. Some peace and quiet aside from the occasional nuke or machine gun bursts!
---
So, I haven't actually thought of that yet and dude you're totally right! Now I have to find a spot where I can us my purifiers to make water. Perhaps by the Overseers CAMP in that river? I'll figure it out.
---
Yea if the AI was natural, if they wandered around a bit, interacted with other people’s pets, etc. it could be cool. It’d still be weird if 20 of 20 people in a group have a dog with them though. 
---
If they were to incorporate dogs, I think it’d be better to either relegate them to your CAMP or to have a few random strays in an instance that you can feed and recruit as a follower for a single play session.
---
No problem, you should also note there are not paints for it available except from the Atom Shop, however some will actually change the appearance of the armor and make it look radically different.
---
Capitalism is the only option
---
He means available to equip like the skins you earn in the gamemode.
---
That's genius! It would have been unfortunate to put the breaks on all of this positive exposure, thanks Bethesda!
---
&gt; For those at work
---
Appreciated, friend!!
---
I agree with you, and I must say I also admire the imagination of the folks that come up with this tricks in multiplayer games.
---
No kidding.
---
I want a Mothman, I run a church and would love to be able to summon him from the sky to help me in battle.
---
That’s an awesome idea. I hope they do this. With so few players using mics it’s vital. It would also give those of us who aren’t great twitch shooters something moderately useful to do.
---
Ii saw this too. Looked like they got smashed in a trash compactor.
---
What happens to you doesn't happen to everyone else. Believe me I rolled a lvl 1 to see how the adventure xp gained stacked up and it is pathetic. I have cards I'd like to put into my NW character and can't that I know would improve my game play this is all because I haven't been able to level up the new character.
---
The only way you can get anywhere near decent XP from NW is by getting to the end and killing a lot of people. This is not usual game play for most people. You can easily level far faster in adventure mode.
---
Yeah I'm finding that, happened after the last few updates. Really annoying.
---
While there are under armors available in the atomic shop, none can be equipped.
---
0. I am horrible at this mode. I can see why people like it though. It was way more fun trying it out than survival mode was.
---
Yeah sure thats exactly what I said internet warrior you won.
---
&gt;Now there is something I did not realise is unique to my country.
---
I'll be honest. Neither did I. It's a nice concept though!
---
What guns are to slow to aim? Gatling and 50 cal are the only guns I hip fire ( more like Kentucky Windage) also I just got the dodgy perk in Nuclear Winter maybe they have that perk card equipped.
---
Ok so you make them essential, but what if a decision you make kills that NPC as part of the story? The tag line is choice and consequence so I’m guessing they’re making decisions around that rather than a typical MMO approach
---
It will probably return to normal next week when most free players leave and NW players get tired. 
---
I did 3 nukes on a server, mainly as close to the Forest safe zone as possible to annoy the newbies so they can't get to Charleston and Morgantown.
---
Still, the new low lever players are a great source of excitement and enjoyment for me, so I'd say Adventure mode is still fun. Many don't know the game rules yet and don't read the text saying "steal" when they pick a lock. I'm at 43/76 with Kill Wanted Player at the moment ;)
---
reactions show that this community is a comfort-loving, downvoting bunch of zero thinkers :(
---
just made it to final 3 players in NW and the server crashed, I downloaded this garbage for free and i still want a refund..
---
Just on sale
---
Still sounds real awesome. Pretty cool they will be able to visit your house. Id kill for robot crafting.
---
You don’t find it fun, you can always quit man
---
Yeah, it’s an ideal spot. I would have taken it myself  but I was a bit too late.
---
It will never happen. They want us to buy more stuff. I already spent some money on some hairstyles and other cosmetics that i never wanted before. I feel the need to be more original when im punching people in vault 51!
---
However, ive witnessed some boxing matches with 20+ naked players that are pretty funny to watch.
---
Cool then I'll avoid buying them.
---
I get that non-stop automatic weapon bug nearly every session thats annoying AF. Surprised my sound drivers haven’t been corrupted too!
---
the game is no longer being removed it will stay on
---
Are you at the max of 1000 scrip?
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh shit pc master over here
---
You gotta be careful who you listen to. Just because they scream threw loudest, doesn't make them the majority. There's still people, calling this game a failure, and gatekeepers who don't believe this is an actual fallout game; they don't speak for everyone.
---
You have that spot too!? Lol. I thought it was just Blitz?
---
From whay ive read it shouodnt be down so maybe its a bug on your end
---
Full beta? This is the beta.
---
Aren't the starting cards random in NW - you only have 7 to choose from?
---
Hey it's there opinions, if they think the game is shit, they're entitled to that. You cant disregard everyone's opinions by calling it "toxic".
---
It's been 20 years, interest piles up man.
---
&gt; They are already coming up with weak lore explanations for some things such as the Brotherhood being in WV.
---
The Brotherhood was never really "in West Virginia."  Maxson used a functioning Satellite to contact former Military personnel attempting for form a BOS West Virginia chapter.  But it was a massive failure.
---
But for the lore to be 100 percent consistent, then gear would basically have to be the same in every game an no legendary gear at all.  I don't see how you can keep any franchise fresh without innovating from time-to-time.
---
Yeah but they are mostly lowbies since NW started. I can't do scorched earth with level 7s!
---
Were in the endgame now
---
NW perk cards don't carry over to adventure mode and visa versa.
---
I have no mods though, and the ini files are from the fresh download...
---
I'm in the acid lake, I'm not sure if Blitz is there or not.
---
I'm actually unaware of any other submerged collector! Time to keep my eyes peeled I suppose. Haha.
---
While were at it can we make Star Wars Episodes 7-9 non-canon? Those things are dumpster fires filled with radrat shit.
---
I don't think the Brotherhood explanation is weak at all.  It's quite plausible that Maxson would reach out to fellow soldiers he trusted and ask for their help supporting his cause.
---
Nobody is forcing you to play, if its not for you its not for you. Nothing wrong with that. Move on to another game.
---
I’m at a junk and lead location myself. I’m my only problem is it’s out of the way.
---
The camp location will depends on what you want for it. Near a water source.
---
Power armor thing is not exclusive to NW. You get a completely different character model during the transition. It also breaks vats in adventure if you target the player as they enter. You will be stuck targetting nothing.
---
Companions don't need be followers.
---
Pills here!
---
There are what, 5 vaults in Appalacia? Any one of them could open and give us locals.
---
isnt that basically what survival mode is?  
---
explore the world, kill some creatures, loot things, kill a player.. no time limit, keep your stuff.
---
I ran into a big community on PS4 called the Mall.  Added someone there on my friends list.  It isn't what you mean, but it's like that in spirit.  I think it's up to 12 different players right near each other.  Me and 3 buddies did this to, built all our camps close together to attract more buyers.
---
Yea this has been an issue since release.
---
I always assumed it was 20 hours (real life) from first time you made a sale, same as the vendors for caps. That also corresponds with my experience, although I've not done exact timing on it.
---
Hahahaha. Love it.
---
You know what would be a cool terminal feature?  Final zone.
---
Let’s you know the exact center on the last zone that will be “safe” on the map.
---
I’m so pumped. I had a feeling this was going to happen
---
Yes, but really they could boost up that kill xp a little
---
Truth
---
Nuclear winter has made me realize just how lousy my aim is.
---
If you see a timer with a discount than it’s an item that is staying with a price reduction. 
---
If you see a timer without a discount than it’s limited item that will go away when the timer ends.
---
In that case, you could uninstall the game, find the install directory and manually delete it in case it had any files left, then redownload the game.
---
Is modding weapons and armour worth it before scrapping?
---
Out of curiosity, have you ever messed with your sound drivers?  I remember Windows 10 used to throw a fuss about the Realtek system in mine, and the playback was pretty staticky as well.
---
There are certain mutations and perks that benefit teamwork.    
---
Mutations: Herd mentality (benefits mutant) and empath (benefits team)  
---
Perks: Stranger in numbers and bodyguard both benefit the perk holder.  
---
So maybe they are spec'd for team and they need someone...anyone to team with.
---
I guess i should rephrase my question. From Bethesda-“free trial week June 10-17th”, have they said if nw will be available after the 17th still? I don’t see anything regarding a timeline for this “beta” other than the aforementioned dates
---
idk if you've seen my edit but there are most of the cards listed
---
Daniel from the trailer having 400k wives and maybe 200k husbands ? 😆
---
It really shouldnt be. If persist I am going to ask for compensation
---
You make the game. It's not like other fallout or open world titles. Also it is best to play with friends
---
Honestly I prefer Adventure, but I'm usually solo and I can't get past my current quests so I'm playing Nuclear Winter for the unlockables. I think a lot of people are in the same boat.
---
there´s no loot, the items are SKINS and ICONS.
---
It would still need a few things: 
---
* More players on each map - 24 for that giant map is awful 
---
* More reasons for people to bunch up in specific zones. Workshops and Events are a good *start* but workshops need to be fleshed out more, and Events need to better populated.
---
If its free sure. If its gonna cost real money/atoms heck no. But I guess we will get this sooner or later.
---
this is stupid.
---
have you created a ticket on the actual bethesda forums? this post is feeding the problem.
---
Lame.
---
The longer a series runs, the more retconning becomes almost a requirement.  I would think it's near impossible to keep a franchise alive while keeping the lore 100 percent consistent.
---
Gunplay is still really bad unless they plan to make changes...
---
He’s got a pretty good spot, honestly. Kinda jealous. Lol. But I gave up on the resource nodes a while back. Got tired of my camp not loading in. It would be like 5 server hops just to get our whole team in. Lol.
---
nice, didn't notice that, thanks!
---
I like this idea
---
It took me until Overseer Level 15 to git gud, and managed to snag my first three wins yesterday. However between those wins I still have multiple times where I die within 5 minutes in the first round, so don't let bad starters discourage you.
---
Ooooh! I like this idea, that’d be great!
---
That's not a bad idea.  
---
Calling u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
That's the reason I was looking for the name of the place !
---
I’d be down if it was like 1k atoms and you could earn them back in the battle pass—even if you couldn’t you get so many from dailies and weeklies it wouldn’t be too hard to save up for :P
---
I’m sure there would be a free reward track too, they always do that.
---
Hacking in NW and other BR's I play is why I hope Dev's consider releasing their games to Google Stadia. I would love to see F76 on Stadia so that I don't have to worry about other players manipulating files. 
---
(would also love to play 76 and other Bethesda games anywhere ;) )
---
I’ve noticed a smaller increase of stuff that I’ve modded. It’s not much more but it helps when your trying to make a cap or two. Especially as me as I have lots of scrap to do so.
---
 "What are you guys doing that's holding your interest? "
---
PLAYING the game.
---
I added everyone so far in the sub! See you all in the wasteland
---
I should say i am on PS4. It takes decades to turn around while aiming.
---
Yeah, for me, it's always CAMPs in Whitesprings.  The framerate just dives whenever I'm near one there.
---
Nice. Honestly I hope they open up a fallout 4 server where you can play through with friends. For lore, say it's from the memory den
---
no, you should just uninstall the game.
---
Consoles have headphone users as well, and I can pinpoint enemy gunfire pretty accurately with mine.  I'm hearing impaired, and don't have an trouble with it.
---
you can take your collected Scrip to the new train station in Berkeley Springs, and use them to force a legendary spawn with the new merchant, it is completely random what you get, but you can choose Armor, Melee, and Ranged weapons of 1, 2 or 3 star rolls
---
As a sneaky type, I tended to park my companions at the entrance of a building and clear the place out by myself.  They'd often ruin the carefully laid chokepoint traps and ambushes I'd set up, not to mention ruin my perimeter sniping, so I pretty much just interacted with them as porters and conversational companions.  I never really utilized them for combat.
---
It would be nice to have a housemate that stayed at home and took care of the place when I'm gone.  Picking crops, boiling water, milking the brahmin, that sort of thing.  Coming home to a hot bowl of vegetable medley soup after hauling back a pile of steel and legendaries from West-Tek would be really nice.  If I could equip my friend with a legendary shotgun or plasma rifle to ward off mole rats and super mutants, that would be even better.
---
Nope. I only got 94. I did get up to 1000 but I started buying things with it at that point.
---
u/Valseek
---
Feedback that might be QoL valuable
---
Players rely on VATS way too much. It’s definitely nice to see it shaken up a bit.
---
I came here to say just that, VATS is fine and dandy in the normal free roam, but survival would be much better without the VATS crutch. It would require a lot more skill and make ambushing players a bit harder.
---
Yes there will be a quakecon this year
---
So maybe they will tease some more wastelanders
---
That would be amazing
---
It actually made me remember how much I miss actually surviving in the game. Needing to look for equipment and being thnakful for whatever you find feels right at home for fallout.
---
Fair points. To each their own, I guess.
---
I'm glad for the pvp crowd, y'all needed something more balanced than survival. I will be in adventure taking all the junk on PS4 . Offering assistance to any new players that I come across, or anyone else . Here's where I do the Bethesda please part. I need a minute man hat to wear with my duster . One wastelanders arrives I will need it so I can inform players about the settlements tat need their help.
---
I loved to leave human at a sliver of health for dogmeat to leap in and RIP their necks out
---
I think the BR will receive a lot of attention as they work on cheat detectIon and fixing exploits. There's video evidence of people basically going around with no clip and flight
---
u/Toddulous_H... 
---
🧐
---
Do you use mods?  When I use mods everything in the atomic shop is invisible strangely
---
Oh. Yeah that makes no sense... but I'm sure we could conjure up some lore friendly scenario that works!!
---
Maybe fill it with my life time supply of cram.
---
HA! I read it the same way!
---
I think the purveyor should issue mods that apply legendary effects to weapons/armour. That way you still need to craft it, but you can modify it and sell/use it.
---
I have a PS4 with no mods
---
Agreed. Us old farts with slow gun skills should team up and take over Adventure. On the plus side there are plenty of plastic pumpkins at Morgantown High!
---
Yeah, it's bothersome for sure but I'm too lazy to move again for now lol.
---
Lol compensation? Goodluck
---
It's an issue on your end, I am having issues too ever since the windows update 2 days ago
---
THERE IS TEAM MEDIC
---
EHRMAGERD!
---
now let's hope i get lucky and find it. do you still get perks by levelling even when you're done with the achievement perks?
---
...and I'm running low on Advanced Repair Kits!
---
Good to see people coming back to the filthy wasteland. Glad your back 😁
---
True, only just passed level 10 in NW but I've noticed I'm already getting better at shooting on the move and relying less on VATS in adventure. Very useful especially while Gun Fu seems to be broken.
---
still garbage.  common to crash going in.  if you get by that, common to crash during fights.  if you get by that, enjoy your nocturnal wood right leg.
---
it happens a lot.
---
I'm pretty sure this was their intention all along. The small time window meant players would have motivation to jump in right away - but if they ended up getting hooked on the mode it would be gone from the game for months and so would they. 
---
Very smart model
---
Oh I know, I welcomed it from the get go, but was careful to share my opinion about it, lol. This sub just seemed like it was unanimously against it. I suspect most of the people that were curious about it kept quiet, like myself.
---
Absolutely. I am not saying don't do anything, obviously make it as good as it can be. I just dont want that to become the main focus. I am having flashbacks to H1Z1 thinking about it...lets not do that.
---
that's some FUGLY paint man
---
When you're on a server, make it a point to befriend players who launch nukes on the SBQ.  Especially if they do it multiple times.  Chances are, this is a normal activity for them and you'll have a greater chance of running SBQ events.
---
Of course it does! Seemed like a no brainer to me. More ways  to play is usually a good thing.
---
You don't *need* to, but you might want to 😉 Being close levels makes it easier and harder at the same time - it's easier because everyone can get hits in without worrying about 1 shot kills; it's harder because sometimes it is convenient to have that high level damage dealer.
---
As for quests and stuff... if I'm honest... when I'm on a team I don't even pay attention to it all. Too focused on what my team is saying to be able to read or listen to a holo.
---
And how about MOBA's, which can easily last between 30 minutes to half an hour, and you lose all progress at the end. A battle royale is not defined by the time it takes to compelete, you battle royale players are just to braindead to play a game longer than 20 minutes without spazzing out.
---
Bethesda account banned
---
Thanks for your reports about this one. We've done some investigating into this and we're currently looking to release a fix with our next update.
---
IM SORRY
---
PRAISE TODD HOWARD, OUR BENEVOLENT LORD AND SAVIOR
---
Use your other one.
---
My guess is they don't want to over commit yet.  If he said 'yes' now then everyone would expect it tomorrow.
---
You can start solo or with 1-3 people
---
that gave me a good chuckle.
---
nevermind the crappy legendary rewards, i'd be happy enough with the event working properly, it really looks amazing and plays nice but i can't bear the idea of farming for mats to go there, fight for that long just to crash right before the end
---
It all depends really. 
---
If you don’t think you’d enjoy being little stronger than the enemies you’ll find back at the beginning, or trying to carry or friends through that quests then you should be fine as your current character. If they or you would rather take it together, then that’s fine too. It’s not the end of the world however to play as an already leveled character, speaking from experience with other friends. 
---
As for terminals and such, that isn’t such a big problem. Most holos don’t provide information that is crazy important, and your quest log gets updated anyway so you’ll know what to do.
---
I mean the same.
---
There's no reason all the cosmetics shouldnt be available if they give no stat bonus. Make *all* the clothes store unlockable after you've found them.
---
What about Nick? Human or robot?
---
This right here
---
internet explorer will load up before they catch up with current events

Thank u

Yes, can start solo or with 1-3 people

There's been lots of posts with video proof of everything from aimbots to flying to clipping through the map and teleporting. But the mods keep deleting them because the videos violate the cheaters privacy.
---
I have been trying to find that place for weeks.

If we ever get cross play ( I'm a PC guy) I would definitely stop by. I'd be the random guy that comes up and plays taps on open mic. (I'm an Army veteran) my condolences bud. There truly isnt any other community like the gaming one. We are all connected somehow. Safe travels in Appalachia and a good memory never fades. Keep his mantle burning for as long as you play.
---
I hardly kill anyone in it. I use this cunning tactic called moving away from the gunfire, which is open to all levels, no perks necessary.
---
That's good to know, I just started it yesterday, gonna get on here in a bit

Winner winner, cram-can dinner!

If you are on PS4 I have some friends that are looking for more teammates, they have mics and have been meeting new players to join our group of survivors .
---
Yeah it used to save password but doesn't anymore..
---
If I've been unable to get onto fallout and receive free stuff due to a bug then it's a problem with their game. If something is free I should have the right to claim it. My wifi is running at full 30mbps and it's still an issue.
---
This was one of the most requested features when PUBG launched. Bethesda should really just look at what that community said and just do those things- add a killcam, add a requeue option, then devote the rest of the time to performance improvements/less loading screens.
---
Oh and another idea - more map locations! I'd love to see a Cranberry Bog for example. Toxic Valley would be *great* for a hectic close quarters map, just imagine people fighting in the water park and using those sewers
---
Had one douche visit my vending, kill a Brahmin, then fast travel. Didn't take the meat and leather. I mean, WTF? I can understand if you're hungry, but that's pretty low...and strange.
---
Solo just turn off auto fill before you start search
---
Drop your settings down to medium, don’t touch the sliders just mess with the texture settings etc. This might gain you a few FPS but doesn’t fix the problem.
---
I had a feeling that this was the plan all along.
---
Once you have all 4 Nuke codes and the Brief Case, enter your pipboy and select it under the Misc tab. The map will appear, select an area and enjoy the show! 8)
---
Demolition Expert and Nerd Rage/ The perk with heavy guns that staggers/armor penetration are really nice.
---
well technically your request has already been answered.. we are the appalachian locals, we are the ones that survived everything that happened to appalachia.   
---
i get what youre asking but what youre asking for is us.   
---
the other vaults had issues and killed the residents (the other locals), the locals that werent in vaults as others have said became ghouls or were killed when the scorched plague came through (while we were protected in our vault). another vault was center to the parasitic plant/vine issue and since we cant get in yet not going to speculate if all are dead/fine and trapped inside due to vines locking door in place, or mutated into something else.  
---
have to keep in mind there were other vaults of locals not just us, but their vaults had issues, got corrupted, got invaded, or destroyed. our vault the only thing that made it through are the only actual locals left in appalachia. 
---
we basically had three deadly viruses run rampant through appalachia.. scorched, vines, and radiation.. all the scorched, ghouls, monsters (grafton/snallygaster/mutants) are the locals.  
---
thats why it makes sense that wastelanders is bringing in people from outside of appalachia, as people migrate trying to find safer places to settle they pass through or land here meeting us.. the locals.
---
Same here. NW coinciding with me kind of running out of things to do on adventure mode..it will be awhile until I play it again
---
Hmmm it wont let me uninstall the game. Says it cant access a file.. This is frustrating.
---
i always preferred to be a lone wanderer than to have a companion they just didn't have the best ai and did not add that much to the story.
---
Same got 7 wins now and my first nuke blast to win the game last night. This shit's fun as hell. My only gripe is the map is too small I hope they add more maps. Or areas.
---
Online games have occasional server crashes. It sucks, but it’s just the nature of the beast. No need to get all dramatic about it. Most players have reported that the new mode has been stable with very few bugs. 
---
As for what else to do...there’s an entire massive world to explore with new content being added regularly. The main game isn’t really focused on PvP at all. It doesn’t hold your hand and rewards self direction, curiosity and imagination. If that doesn’t interest you then it’s probably not the game for you. That’s totally fine, but then just move on.
---
 I’m just upset about how I didn’t know under armor didn’t count. Bought the tactical ops only to be disappointed with no refund.
---
I’m very bad at NW but this is a quality game mode, happy it’s staying !
---
Sorry I steeped on a crack....
---
Np
---
Okay. Can we have randomly generated companions like how Settlers were in Fallout 4? Just give them their own personalities and randomized name.
---
Sweet yeah it's all Bethesda I think there so it'd make sense... Even if it's just a small discussion on the companion mechanics or something
---
And it's important that if this is implemented, make it so pre-war money doesn't auto-scrap anymore.
---
This would also make Collision Course an even better event for newbies as it gives 100 pre-war cash. Same for Mr Prize bot.
---
Early synth prototype
---
Yes they do WTF are you talking about? I saw someone do it three times yesterday.
---
Do events and just explore.
---
it is in the mire east of yellow sandy's still
---
Dude... I like my steaks blue rare. It's how I eat them. never get sick.
---
I do not eat a steak that has been sitting our for 5 days and has maggots on it...
---
I've seen a 1* Bloodied Handmade go for as high as 5k.  3k is around the norm on a trade sub.  Vendors the prices tend to be lower if you can find one but I've seen some very expensive 1* pieces at vendors in game too.
---
2* BE, B25, BSS weapons - always 20k+ or trade only.  This is post Purveyor too, which should have helped more rolls of better stuff into the game.
---
Selling in your player vendor, looting caps themselves and selling to vender robots are the only ways to make caps. 
---
Plus you can make caps with the new nuclear winter, but it's pittance compared to everything else.
---
the game blows man jus return it
---
Yeah, this is awesome!!
---
I dont like getting killed all the time, but I am getting better, and it's just super fun to play.
---
Thank you BGS!!!
---
Big iron isn’t in the radio, is it? Maybe someone else was playing it
---
Great, thanks!
---
Oh wow, did not know this was a thing.
---
Dont play it in preparation, play it for the fun it is now.
---
I've taken to shooting those damn robots just to shut off that noise :)
---
Just make something ultra basic and call it good if you don't enjoy the mechanic.  
---
It's a free fast travel spot and access to your stash, so if nothing else use it to save travel time to areas you frequent.  You can also use it to produce adhesive from crops and purified water/food.
---
Yes! I love the music choices, but there really need to be more songs in the game for how much you'll be playing it. New Vegas songs would blend perfectly into the existing tracks, as it's hard not to get that Mojave vibe from several already. I'd also like to see the return of the jazz instrumentals from Fallout 3. Also, it would be nice (pun intended) to have a few more 60s songs in the game, so that the Beach Boys' "Wouldn't It Be Nice" doesn't just come out of nowhere in the playlist. Love the song and it's inclusion, but it just seems kinda out of place at the moment. Keep it up Bethesda! As a long-time Fallout player, I've been wary of the game. But from my experience with the free trial, I'm having a blast. It's still rough around the edges, but most endearing things are.
---
So let me get this right tour advice to everyone is to hide at the back avoid any combat and hope that you don't get see by anyone else?
---
Ah okay I figured as much just didn’t know if I was missing out on anything else, thank you
---
That's when you rush to get a weapon and gun them down or get gunned down.
---
Yes, this please.
---
I wouldn't call it an issue. It's designed like that so you can equip a different hat if you like.
---
Welcome to battle royal where no one can shoot very well and armor really doesn't matter lol. Truly i think i see more bloodshed in the vault then i do on the battlefield you can't take 2 steps without someone punching you in the back of the head lol.
---
Truly though i really like the battle royal i really like how to get exp and caps for adventure mode based on your performance.
---
Interesting! Perhaps I'll get lucky and find some good equipment to help me vaporize those stupid charred ghouls; f\*\*\*ers keep ruining my chances of getting into Whitespring unharmed.
---
For the vertibot and cargobot pics you have to get pretty close to them for it to register. Completed both of those.
---
cant wait to eventually get the outcast paint set!
---
 I'm guessing the added stress of every player having an AI following them around would make servers unstable as hell.
---
&gt; I was always a Dogmeat and Codsworth player in FO4.
---
I use everyone else just long enough to do their personal quests and get their perks, but when that's done, Dogmeat never leaves my side.
---
Well, I still don't see everyone running around with a backpack.  If they make it a bit time consuming to get a pet, it might naturally limit how many players will have them.
---
Plus, I'd have to start sharing my Canned Dog Food, so I'm not sure how I feel about that. X)
---
What lvl u need to be?
---
It reminds me that gunplay was never a strong suit in fallout
---
Yeah, its basically the skyrim thing but in fallout
---
You only have to take 75 in total though and your all done.
---
Annoying i know though
---
They updated the announcement page to state it would now keep going as a beta.
---
I hated away from 76 after hearing all of the bad about it. 
---
I came into blind about 4 days ago and I love it. It’s like Fallout 4. But with other people.
---
Oh shit... I forgot they said you could do that. Good call, thanks!
---
I didn’t know he was blind
---
That is a brilliant idea.
---
Hardly - COD is faster paced.
---
You should try out Adventure mode instead.
---
Its not this deep theres like 5 in the game lol
---
Yep. That's why I'm winning, not whining.
---
Amazing story thank you for sharing.
---
to be honest, I collect all ammo I stumble on. then drop it on low level players in blocks of 500 at no charge. I only use melee and gauss so its all lost on me. having to waste space in a vending machine for ammo annoys me.
---
But everyone is hyped for BR....?
---
I have this problem as well
---
That's good to know, I have some and I don't use them,
---
I imagine they will appear in certain areas during certain quests if you had previously “recruited” them beforehand. It’s been said they won’t be following or have the ability to carry items for you though. So far seems like they will be dialogue/ romance options and combat help when wanted
---
I sincerely would play survival mode 24/7 if the pvp was like NW. No stupid one shot builds. But i also don't want Bethesda nerfing for PvP and ignoring PvE.
---
I uninstalled the game before I bought it, just to be sure I wouldn't *not* get back those minutes of my life playing the game.
---
Never been happier :D
---
If you buy something from a robot vendor, a fraction of what you pay to them replenishes their caps stash.
---
It's 1,400 from vendors (recharged by a % every time you buy something from them), but there is no daily limit on player vending, events, or other sources of caps.  Just the 25,000 total.
---
Not only that, but it would make the world SCARY again. 
---
You can’t just walk around spamming Q and looking for everyone and anyone.
---
it isn't supposed to be, but I definitely heard it on the Appalachia radio station
---
ok. I tried the vertibot one at the Munitions Factory. Tried to get the whole thing in the frame, but maybe I needed to be closer....  
---
I have only tried the cargobot one while they were flying so I will try to do a drop and get a pic.
---
Picture of a small or medium generator works and if you take Poseidon or wade airport workshops, then repair the landing pad a vertigo that spawns and that photo is close enough to work. The musician badge is still bugged though.
---
I don't have any friends :( and although I uninstalled the game before installing it, FO76 is perfectly fine solo. Friends are for wimps :)
---
Never once saw it in this game or blackout. Sometimes on pubg but people aren't that stupid anymore.
---
I just want to wear my outfit over my armor.
---
Explosive effects are bugged on energy weapons - basically turns them into ballistic explosive weapons instead.  With the high ROF and explosive to stagger sentinel armor players, legacy explosive lasers work well for PvP thus everyone wants them now.
---
A true energy weapon that isn't legendary explosive doesn't even get any working anti-armor effects so these are much worse than legacy explosive weapons.
---
My understanding is this (could be wrong):
---
Explosive laser + beam splitter mod = multiple explosions at full damage. Totally OP, especially at full auto. I’m very, very confident that they will nerf or remove these weapons from the game. The combo already doesn’t drop anymore. 
---
I bought a bloodied explosive from someone’s vending machine a few weeks back. I don’t run bloodied, always near full health. I don’t even run demo expert. Even with all that in mind, the thing melts absolutely everything—especially other players. 
---
It also breaks in 100-200 shots. It’s basically useless for PvE, as it just doesn’t last. I have mine just in case I run into anyone when I go into Survival for the weekly challenges.
---
Maybe implement something like battlefield? Where the percent of damage done translates to exp if the opponent dies soon after the damage is done.
---
i have the same every now and then, but it’s almost completely random what matches will be laggy and what won’t. 
---
sometimes i can do a close to 20-minute match with almost no stuttering at all and sometimes i can’t get off the spawn point before dying to a mirelurk hunter because i couldn’t move when the fps went below 5.
---
but it’s still a “pre-beta sneak peek” so it’s understandable if it doesnt work perfectly yet
---
Wow, that was an unexpected but good move
---
Surprised I’ve seen no one mention that communicating with you’re team is also massively helpful. Planning spawn locations and spotting can make all the difference.
---
Those 50 man finals must be some show.
---
So refreshing to read this. After all the praise for NW, I felt like I was the only one not enjoying it. I spent a solid hour or so last night repeating this exact cycle. That’s all I could take. It felt like 75% of that time was spent in the lobby or a loading screen. Waste of time.
---
I would love this. Mostly for the fact of the menu music gets so intense while waiting.
---
Quite honestly it not all that different of advice that I would give anyone going into survival for the first time.  
---
Don’t spawn into Whitesprings or the WS Train Station right away.  If you do there’s a good chance someone will try to jack you right away. 
---
Get to know the map and good areas to farm and explore and hold defensive positions.  Figure out player movement patterns or common places people like to go. 
---
I only engage players when I know I have a tactical advantage.  The best time is when other players engage and you can swoop in while they are distracted or aren’t expecting it.
---
Todd please stop.
---
Loot cap stashes, if you google cap stash runs you’ll find videos or routes you can take and if you equip the perk cap collector you can search the container for extra caps. Every little helps.
---
Combing the wasteland for cap stashes on a regular basis, also known as "Cap Runs" is my favorite sideline money maker. There's YouTube videos, do a search and you can find some good routes (though Bethesda seems to like to switch them up everyone other patch cycle or so). Some do spawn randomly as well, so it's never a sure thing but I routinely get 800-1000 caps every other day doing this. I've hit single cap stashes with as much as 300 caps in them, but the average is 30-50 with the "Cap Collector" PERK card maxed out.
---
I did the one at the airport quest. It had to get really low and you have to use regular lens as far as i can tell. Vertibot jist build one in a workshop.
---
Maybe it was because you were stating the obvious? I mean it's a surprise to no one. People gonna cheat. Its most prevalent on pc . Surprise !
---
As soon as (/if) we get a full version of it, I'm certain there will be a mod for it!
---
Nevermind then I'm on ps4
---
That explains it well! 👍
---
Thanks! I will try that tonight!  
---
Do you know if any other instruments are bugged? I haven't tried too may others.
---
Too late.
---
I have come within inches of winning a few times and actually launched a nuke and found power  armour a .50cal mg and a tesla cannon all in the same match
---
Yeah saw that.. I like they're keeping it too, but sucks for people who grinded for slocum joe's pa paint.
---
Some thorough play testing indeed lol.
---
When it happens with players, they can switchout a weapon to cure it.   I’ve noticed my automatic tesla has been giving people the bug recently. Most of the time that it happens, its just a sound coming from a point in the area that no one is there yet the sound persists.
---
One session I fast traveled away from the effected area. Over an hour later I came back to that area, it was still happening! I don’t get how it hadn’t reset after that long of a time period.
---
Logout/in was the only solution.
---
This.  I’ve done this in survival mode a lot.  Wait for the animals to blast each other and then attack when they are regrouping.
---
Lol I mean it's not though?
---
What I haven't read by now is: welcome to the world after the end of the world as we know it. I think it makes a very unique "look and feel" atmosphere.
---
And don't worry about your poorly made camp: you'll make a couple. good spots mean you often have to relog as your camp can't be placed (someone else got the spot in this world)
---
I suggest either the Marine Tactical Mask or the Torn Veil if you have it. There’s no yellow bandana I know of in the game but both of these are decent for Scorpion.
---
I's weird, I've noticed the exact opposite. I started playing again after the last patch, break was 3 or 4 weeks I guess. After selling all my crap at Whitsprings, I'll run through the.. I'm not actually sure what you'd call it. The building on the right (as you're leaving the main entrance) and the parking lot.. I get loads of 1\* legendaries dropping from the ghouls that swarm you. And most of the time.. they're not even dropped by enemies marked as legendary.
---
Hellfire basically has no lore to it beyond the East Coast Enclave further researching it, with no indication it wasn't at least in development before the war.
---
What i hope for in Survival is they do a Seasons type deal. 
---
Season begins, you start fresh. Play until the seasons over, earn rewards to your account based on how well you did. 
---
Rinse and repeat with new content/challenges per season.
---
I love how leveled out it is, literally anybody can jump in and have at least a shot.
---
System? I could make you one
---
Blue bandana maybe? I havent seen a yellow one, but leopard print could suffice. Cryo grenades for sub, throwing knives for scorpion, or the sheepsquatch shard.
---
I'd say it's the opposite. We are living NW and dreaming about a more peaceful adventure mode where we are demi-gods with amazing weapons and armor and have subdued the beasts.
---
Can someone post the location of that?
---
I was on PS4 this morning and I fought 2 hordes, both had legendary spawns. No great drops but hordes still happening on PS4.
---
I hope they implement the same detailed map in adventure, perhaps even a local map on pip boy like in the other fallout games.
---
I've only ever seen one other player wearing it, and the clipping with hair/forehead was terrible. Stopped me from getting it.
---
I’ll check these out. Not bad ideas either. Thanks!
---
I'm not on PS4, although I most likely would join up if I was. I'm not a console-type of guy neither.
---
sweet tip ty
---
Make sure you are not running as administrator/elevated. Try deleting the game directory manually, while the launcher is not running, then run repair from the launcher. If that doesn't work, uninstall/delete the launcher, then reinstall the launcher and retry download/repair.
---
Playing an instrument in nukashine doesn’t complete for many, also piano, strangely I have had a bass in my camp since the beta and that auto completed when the badges challenges came along but people have reported the bass doesn’t work for them either.
---
I have done it 3 times total 2 wins 1 fail. No crashes but i dont get constant crashes like some ppl do.
---
Same boat...but I'm going to say It's not my aim...it's totally my latency guys..yeah that's it...latency....
---
I have an extra nukashine in my inventory I can give when I get home from work tonight around 10:30pm eastern time of your willing to wait that long
---
And that's next level dumb. Who cares about the rights of cheaters?
---
I suck pretty bad at it, but when I stopped teaming, went back to playing my sneak/sniper/loner style and only taking shots when I think I can get an easy kill it became much more fun for me and it beats getting killed right away.
---
I'll probably never win a watch, but at least I can grind to get rewards now.
---
Throwing knives isn’t a bad idea at all! However we had molotovs in mind.
---
I'm thinking of starting a Twitch stream. It'll be riveting viewing.
---
Is it here to stay for good? Or is it just being extended by another week or something?
---
They don’t.
---
I’ll see what I can do
---
It connects to the mining museum if I remember correctly.
---
I enjoyed the game a lot when I first played it, and I don't doubt that the majority of the bugs have been fixed, I'm just worried that it's too late to start an entirely new character and I'll wont be able to catch up to other players
---
theres a datamine that says charleston, just north of harpers ferry, and near top of the world (like arktos-ish) will all be maps in the future, or at least are being heavily considered
---
That’s actually pretty interesting. I really liked the concept, hopefully bethesda will explore this a bit more later down the line.
---
Very nice. Thank you.
---
YES, please, Different ammo types would be awesome and it would add more thinking to your adventures and fighting
---
IIRC you can go to one of the tabs on Camp mode, and you should be able to scrap the stored structure
---
IF I could just get my team to not charge forward, why does EVERYONE want to gallop straight into Flatwoods. Its' murdertown y'all
---
BRs shouldnt be comfort at all (nor should it be easy to lvl up). the  whole point of a BR is to be the last survivor, which implifies that you  need at least 1 kill to win the round (except the 2nd placed player is  killing himself) but the rest, you could basically just hide and/or  loot. This is a what makes a battle royale a battle royal and no  deathmatch where its all about kills...but hey maybe people are just  used to be taken by the hand and cant deal with frustration anymore, i  dunno.
---
Someone reminded them that we'll quality test it for free so ...
---
You will, I started Monday and I’m already level 23
---
Oh bethesda
---
Check his tweet history. He's a delight.
---
I'm sure I read somewhere that nuclear winter would be adding new perks I was hoping it there would be new ones to carry over to adventure
---
The notification comes way more often than actually leveling up. I get the notification also every third or four rounds and there's usually no level to claim. Why not add a small xp par as well to the interface, to make it easier to see how far away from next adventure level we are.
---
I also eat raw. air-dried caribou meat... but I figure "fresh and near-raw" explains it better.
---
You probably have one of the default cards that double your damage vs them. I took it off because it’s just a useless card since they die so easy without it
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed the non legendaries dropping 1* legendaries too. It’s weird.
---
They made a post saying it's gonna stay
---
you're previous statement itself was an assumption, hypocrite
---
While on one hand this would be a great QoL change, it would inevitably lead to folks queuing and walking away, for hours or days at a time. 
---
If they could implement some type of no-movement/kick mechanic, that'd probably a great counter. But I suspect it's a bit more complex than that.
---
10/10 if we buy a canvas bag stash box and it looks like cheap plastic material when we place it. THAT would be fun.
---
Hey I'll take you up on that if he doesn't...PSN is same as on here.
---
Someone has pointed out in another post that VATS is still useful in NW for things like targeting your own grenades and mines. 
---
I think it also still works on creatures.
---
So as much as I would like to be able to switch weapons and equipment more deftly, I wouldn’t ever want to drop VATS
---
Or the fact that I might be hoping for some gear for my low-level alt.  It's not up to anyone else to decide whether the loot I'm entitled to is "worth it" or not to me.
---
You make it
---
You have a funny way of saying the word bull shit
---
I play survival a fair amount and while I use VATS on enemies I rarely use it on players.  
---
If they did nothing else than get rid of the top 3 (visible on map) it would be solid.  Having that target on your back is often a death sentence.
---
I can’t even find an explosive rifle lol
---
I can’t. I just started the quest and it says I need to drink it
---
Spoken like a true raider.
---
Yeah, they're exclusive to Nuclear Winter, they don't carry over into Adventure.
---
I normally destroy bases in pvp, but if we ever get in pvp I won’t destroy yours.
---
I am a bit of an ass.
---
They are infected though, it's not a choice, all mind controlled by the sbq. Man I can't even remember the story of da:origins, but I do remember that cave with the cult.
---
Father is Almalexia (The Lying Parent)
---
Deacon is Sotha Sil (The Man/Machine)
---
Preston is Vivec (The Warrior Poet)
---
Maybe that veil you get from the mistress quest line would do well for a scorpion build.
---
Dude tell me why this dumb ass little viking guy was trying to argue in a post where I said the same thing that legendaries aren't unbalanced and they just suck at pvp, and then he suggests people drop their legendaries on death so people with OP legendaries can get even more legendaries and monopolize survival, what a tool right?
---
The magazines have a cover price of $39 in issue.
---
There was some fun ones and some legit hards ones too. 
---
Nice find.
---
That will be the most dull and uninteresting show.
---
10 mins of you crouching in bushes with  fire at your back.
---
I can see it in your eyes
---
Seriously what?
---
Where are you farming? They are all over
---
well as far as we know the dlc isn't out yet. hope they add new perks with the next dlc for other modes as well
---
As someone who did that thing, I recommend it. Commando easts ammo like crazy, but it's so satisfying.
---
Why this hasen't like 3000 upvotes??
---
I’ve had luck finding explosive weapons in survival mode but its still very rare
---
I've been trying to catch and I bought spawn in the golf club house for just this reason.
---
Got my ammo route nailed, 80K 5.56 in the bank :)
---
Satisfaction is what I want!
---
Exploring, enjoying the scenery and sounds, base building, crafting, vending, doing events to collect rare outfits, taking down legendaries in the never ending pursuit of better gear, daily &amp; weekly challenges, making up my own challenges just to entertain myself, welcoming new players with free gifts, there’s a lot you can do, if you don’t enjoy any of those kinds of things though I don’t know what to recommend.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bzrzjq/list_of_nuclear_winter_rewards_by_rank_and_how_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app list of the rewards
---
Oh damn. Yeah. Go to town! That's a crazy amount.
---
That’s actually how I play survival mode.  For me it’s not about how many player kills I have but how many enemies I kill and stay alive.
---
Sometimes it's visually glitched at zero until you sell something then it displays the correct amount.
---
They are way overpowered so they are good to buy and use for pvp. But yes they are girl weapons especially with a Vats build. The Vats ignores Sentinal Armour which it shouldnt and really it's just a aim bot. Half the people killing in this game would have there egos crushed if they removed Vats and required accuracy.
---
I wish the "Tales of" ones would have went off the other challenges completed... I dumped those a long time ago when I dumped like 200 holo's! lol
---
Seriously, furthermore some of the questions are just off the wall, but are pretty funny though.
---
“A patient of yours is in comatose, their fate lies within your hands, what do you do?”
---
A: “pull the plug.”
---
B: “let the family decide.”
---
C: “keep them under comatose state.”
---
D: “(can’t remember)”
---
Everyone gave you great advice with going to Lucky Hole Mine just watch out for your weight ore weighs  .10 pounds and super duper along with ammo smith will increase your yield.
---
Steel- I farm Welch and load in from the train station I can get 150-300 steel a server hop with scrapper perk equipped.

Acid- Two locations you will have to decide which location is easiest for you.
---
Mountainside Bed and Breakfast there are 2 static  spawn Yao Guai that spawn by the train cars you should be able to get 10-12 Acid each server hop.
---
Toxic Larry's Meat- 3  static Snallygaster spawns you should be able to get 21 acid a server hop.
---
 In just 10 server hops at Toxic Larry's you can get 200ish acid store this in your stash then server hop lucky hole mine twice for 400 lead ore smelt it all down for 1000 lead and get crafting some ammo.
---
Also with everyone on Nuclear Winter you might have luck farming weights from Charleston Fire Station, Flat woods motel, Eastern Regional Penitentiary yard, and a bunch more locations Google is your friend.
---
Yeah I generally take it easy in the first half of a match, unless I'm sure I can take the guy down I generally stay hidden in the bushes and my whitey tighties and make my way to the centre point. Let everyone else whittle the numbers down, you don't get much XP per kill anyways.
---
Lol I was just thinking today that the newbs have been adding a bit more red to the map of every single server I hop into
---
Do Collision Course at Morgantown airport. There will be a cargo bot after you complete it. That’s how I got that one. I had to get really really close for it to register. Thankfully it hovers for a few moments.
---
They've posted now that the "pre-beta sneak peek" Nuclear Winter game mode is going to stay live and in the game:

---
Hey quick question how were you playing on launch, and didnt own the game? Even the beta testing was only allowed through preorder.
---
This awesome! Thanks, was also stuck with how to get more acid.
---
I know what you mean lol
---
Team Medic is really strong, but keep in mind that you need 6 charisma to use it. (I only have 3...)
---
You'll get one perk every levelup until ~15, after that you only get them everytime there is no other reward than a perk.
---
If you're on Xbox, a "Looking for Group" post helps a lot. A buddy of mine did it when I nuked prime and a ton of people jumped in and filled the server up. Usually gets some high-level players in there because who doesn't like farming the Queen for goodies? Same goes for other major events, like Encryptids.
---
Isn't that normal for a controller tho?
---
"I'm not white!? What do you mean I'm not white!?"
---
Arktos makes quite a bit. The plans other than formula p still sell. I think everyone has the encrypted stuff, doesn't sell in the vendor. Biv recipes still sell good too. Pemmican, fusion cores. Farming Lead+4x steel sells fast too (used to be how I made caps). Bundle them and sell on the market like 1k lead + 4k steel.
---
It's NW because it's new and because we we're originally told we had 1 week to try it. If you think adventure is suffering imagine how survival is doing lol.
---
Did you try at the brewer??? And didnt find fermentable nuka shine??
---
"TO aRmS mY bREthrEn, aNdRAstE WiLL gRanT uS vIcToRy ! ! !"
---
Yeah those guys were something else. I highly recommend playing Origins again, it's amazing.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76 lol
---
And here I was thinking I was going to be able to get some sleep next week, oh well :)
---
Open a ticket on their website. Your reddit post gets about as much attention as you did by the mongrel in that match.
---
Best place is the amusement park, the spawn point for it is in the parking lot next to a car in the center. If you server hop, it’s a straight scope shot to see if it’s there and if not, hop again until you find it.
---
Not really companions as much as timed helpers. already off to a good start a guess
---
I was in the building where the party was and a “picked” it up but it’s not in my inventory
---
It's definitely different that's for sure.
---
That's good to hear. I think it would be fun of the maps were random.
---
Made me think of something, just add another recipe for boiled water. 1 purified 1 wood, then all the other recipes work.
---
I spent several hours in survival mode and for about half the time I was automatically highlighted in the top 3.   I came across two other players in that time.
---
I’ve been playing since stress test and the worst bug I’ve encountered before this was the stretched out AI
---
This is the best news i've heard all day. I dig the BR way more than expected and im glad to be able to keep playing and earning rewards!
---
paid shill to drum up reddit upboats
---
I have a vats build and its entirely useless on survival. Anyone with half a brain just crouches and boom your entire build gets invalidated.
---
That's what I am going to do next time. I'm done following close behind in case they need help lol, let them charge in and learn what I already found out the hard way. Don't shoot if you don't have to
---
That's almost 8 minutes longer than I get to play.
---
I have already. You’d be surprised, I made a post yesterday about expanding camp budget and a Bethesda rep replied.
---
Nice!
---
wait a while in he map? it takes 20 seconds at most
---
FIGHT! I play Shao Kahn in 76! Skull Mask, Grognak's Outfit and Axe. Also use Tomahawks! We NEED to meet up.
---
You sure you didnt pick the empty bottle with the label? Go to your misc or notes and see if you have the nuka shine label
---
Or you use stealth boys till another one shows up and clears it for you.
---
And then you watch how the other one launch the nuke.
---
But don't forget to use your last stealth boy for the walk of shame back lol
---
Man, Bethesda just cannot win. First everyone loses their goddamn minds that most NPC's in FO3, 4 and Skyrim are all set to essential, and now that they're letting players kill NPC's again y'all complain...
---
I hoping to hire Morgan Freeman to narrate.
---
Stress test as in NW stress text or Actual Fallout 76 beta in November? Cause this doesn’t really surprise me at all with the game.
---
There nothing there either
---
I played the closed stress test for Xbox that happened in like October
---
No problem
---
Dude, that is sick! Unfortunately we haven’t even started our characters, it’s still in idea phase. Furthest we’ve done is create our characters. But I love your guy!
---
Last week we had 'take photos of 10 robots.'  I got 9 pics completed but it just wouldn't work for vertibot or cargobot.  I tried two different locations on different servers...I tried pics with them flying as well as shot down.  Nothing worked.  Challenge failed.
---
Then I tried for Salt of the Earth.  I still hadn't done 'Kill a creature with a farm tool' and I was awarded the prize.  Hell, I went out of my way to get that pitch fork, too.  
---
Seems most of the challenges are working for me, although I skip the ones that involve PvP or rediculous situations.  
---
The atoms are free and it gives me something to do.  So I'm not complaining.  But it does make me wonder if anyone tests these challenges before they put them out.
---
Why is everyone afraid to swear?
---
This is fucking great news!
---
Or the Master's army in Fallout 1.
---
What does your quest says currently?
---
Ah cool cool, well NW did just come out and it’s in Beta so I’m sure this wasn’t the first time it’s happened, they’ll fix it soon
---
You are right. Facebook is toxic but this game is still far from good. I'm Fallout fanboy (800 hours in 76) but I'm not going to defend Bethesda. They gave us unfinished product and after 6 months many problems are still unfixed. I play on ps4 and I'm missing one trophy to platinum. I try to finish this mission many times but it is still bugged.  I find it funny that  peoples forget so easy that Bethesda lied to us. Todd said it in one of the interviews few weeks ago. Bethesda knew exactly what they were doing. Todd lied to us. We have a right to lie to everybody.
---
In a nutshell, yes. I won't play with ransoms anymore. Waiting for solo/duo's.
---
What makes you think they'll go with a battle pass?  It looks to be monetization via the atom store, and everyone has to buy the base game to play.  Just curious since there's no indication they're going down that route?
---
Yup just saw it. Hell yeah!
---
“Drink a bottle of Nukashine”
---
This isnt poking at you in any way - I also would love a robot or puppy friend...
---
But we all wanted npc. Just not to be friends with! Haha.
---
That would be great. That’s one of the main things I don’t like about battle royale. The loading takes forever
---
Waiting for my friends to download it
---
Are you on pc or console?
---
You cant stealth from other players if wanted and you cant see them on your map. Not sure about the second one I've only been wanted once and it took away the normal caps and toxic water is useless.
---
Stealth won’t help if you’re wanted, and as a new player it’s worth avoiding becoming wanted because it doesn’t go away till you’re killed
---
I drink that water, but only if I need rads. Otherwise it’s only good for boiling to cook with. Purified water is lighter and rad free.
---
I can’t speak to why the caps work the way they do, I don’t pvp much.
---
I have been coming out of pacifist mode to kill wanted noobs, but only so they can avoid being griefed. I always give the thumbs up and walk away after they collect their brown bags.
---
Ill give you one in a bit.
---
I had this idea linked to your backpack to set up a small field station. Then we could stay in the field longer for real roleplaying
---
As someone who never uses power armor I find this list a bit disappointing was hoping for some cool exclusive outfits.
---
I'm probably not being very clear. What I mean is that I earned the card in NW mode. Then I switched out to adventure mode. (I had made a new character specifically for NW and it was only lvl 2.) I went to adventure mode so I could lvl up my character and have a special point to add to my stats. Once I did that, I logged back into NW to equip the card. But it wasn't in my perk cards in NW anymore.
---
Oh yeah... Music and sounds design overall is excellent.
---
I wish I could upvote this multiple times. Tired of the “they are aware and looking into it line”.
---
It's actually explained as to why it's present, and the previous lore never really said it was uniquely post war. Nuclear Winter is definitely dubiously canon in some respects, but it's not entirely non canon.
---
May I ask what you intend on doing with my salt?
---
I'm dying to get that lol 50 centurion helmet.
---
Thought free talk implies posting about subjects NOT game related?
---
Ok wtf how?
---
Fortnite didn't start out with a Battle Pass or Battle Royale for that matter, it started out as a Paid game and the Battle Royale mode was added later. 
---
It worked out for them in dividends and now there are tons of game that have Battle Royale modes or made specifically for a Battle Royale model, most of these games include a Battle Pass including Fortnite. 
---
I'm not saying they will take this route, but considering where the game market is currently with the game providing free updates, the potential is there. 
---
I'm just hoping they don't take this direction. This post wasn't to say that it will but that if the thoughts are there, I hope they chose not to go that direction.
---
You'd have to hit the trade subs and monitor transactions to understand the true market value (caps/trades) of items.  The game's recommendation can be way off - mutation serums should be priced much cheaper, weapons/armor way more.
---
Explore other camps and see what players are selling for. Sometimes I let the game default price go as well.
---
I tried to farm legendaries at a horde in the forest last night on PS4 and after 4 waves just killed the legendary because the spawns were all level 5 with no legendaries.
---
Before the last patch I used to get 4-5 legendary spawns by keeping the event target alive.
---
This is beautiful. I would be happy and honored to give a 21 gun salute to your Poppy and pay my respects to his resting place. I will send a PM to you with my gamer tag.
---
&gt;It doesn't make any of this less true
---
You can't get any less true than something that's false.
---
Yeah that's a good shout!
---
Wtf is a zdud?
---
Yarp, most teams I’ve randomed with try to spawn on new river gorge resort and sure enough I see flailing arms within a minute or so!
---
Wait, missile launcher? Is that actually in NW? I've only seen the grenade launchers and im rank 17.
---
You could try looking at the bazzar reddit for 76 (can't remember the name to tag it) for a reference. Other than that it's mainly what you think its worth or what you want out of it.
---
Ah ok got it - yeah, hopefully they don't go down that route.  I do worry they're trying too hard to copy on Fortnite but at least they seem to have hit a different take on BR that's not exactly Fortnite.
---
maybe he got a refund?
---
Atom shop is their money maker and updates are free. I highly doubt if any passes coming along.
---
The answer is yes. 
---
I’ll let you figure out all the reasons why for yourself, but for me there are many.
---
Ye
---
One of the best runs I had was picking up chameleon serum in the first box I found and stealthing my way to the centre with a crossbow! Noice!
---
I've seen that maybe once or twice, very rare. What's more common is Glowing ones and no nuke. Dropping legendary weapons like crazyyyyy.
---
Also don't get in the habit of filling your stash with junk trust me very few items with you need more then 100 of and most you can get away with having 25-50 pieces in your stash.
---
I don't think it does.
---
Yay! Now I'll get a chance to play!
---
Anyone with that build and half a brain would simply shoot that person once, then use vats. Lmao.
---
Long lost twin??
---
I’m going to single handedly change the trade currency of the wasteland
---
They really made a battle royale mode? if so im damn glad i left the game.
---
So does this mean double xp on NW next week too?
---
So far my 4 th run I was last out of my team so used toilet again and they where about 3 last people around me so I waited out few last seconds to jump them with a Shotgun but they had advantage cuse of power armor and mini chain gun
---
I like ADA myself....but yea in the original game...Doggy all the way.  Didn't bother with any others.  Ever.
---
3/4ths the price may work well for you, other than mutation serums. Especially considering they have to make their way to you. I sell aids at half price and bobbleheads at 1/4th. I try to sell for what I would buy for, is all.
---
Is it not moving? Then it's too high.
---
Honestly, the opinions are gonna vary so much.
---
To me...none of this shit is real, and it's no tactually money. I sell everything super cheap. Plans and clothes are about 30% of "suggested price".
---
Gear and weapons are 50% of suggested price.
---
...on average,. This changes according to my character played.
---
Some other players take it more seriously and charge a HELL of a lot more. I tend to see it as "I don' t need this, but it might make someone else's game a lot more fun for them" (especially with plans and clothing)
---
While they're at it, let us equip hats AND accessories.  I really want to wear my monacle with the top hat like I do in adventure but for just can't.
---
Find yourself a nice quad legendary rifle. Increases satisfaction so much.
---
I wish I could say thanks to Todd howard and the dev's
---
Would you trade your laser rifle for a bloodied explosive Tesla shotgun?
---
ya I am *actually* redownloading the game to give it a try... never thought id see the day
---
but fallout BR is the one time me and my friends thought BR would be amazing and make sense (normally we dont care for BR, him more then me, I tried them all)
---
anyways, thats my minirant
---
VATS is heavily used by melee builds to instakill people. It completely fucks with any ranged build when the guy disappears and hits you from behind.
---
they can't help themselves, want to get sum
---
I'd like to see this as a camp only option...to replace whisperer.  Need Robotics Expert perks to do it, but lets you build a camp-locked Robo Friend.  And give us the entire option set from the Mechanist expansion...or at least a decent chunk of it.  You can build anything from a full sentry bot to a robo butler :-)
---
It's actually quite good. At least give it a try if you already own the game.
---
No worries man.
---
Psn was totally down the other day. I think as per usual the ps4 has the worst time out of all systems.
---
Agreed and that's why I enjoy their mode and hope it doesn't go that way. I really enjoy playing Adventure with my friends and having NW as a way to get some really cool CAMP items is very fun to have a change of pace from time to time.
---
That stretches my screen what useless advise from BGS.
---
whats the workaround?
---
First win I had was with a group of randoms. We took our time, went town to town and was killing this one team on a hill side. Next thing we know there was one more player and we killed him and won. 
---
Didn’t even kill that many in that match. Max I had was 3. So everyone else must of killed each other. Wasn’t paying attention to the remaining count lol.
---
Man I miss your YouTube channel
---
Robot, but counts as human.  Tech base it too divergent to be upgraded via automaton parts.  Always thought that Nick should have had some upgrade options within the facility though.  No reason he shouldn't have.  Particularly if you went for that ending.....
---
jon???
---
Making them take prewar money doesn't actually fit the lore. Since it is said that they take caps as a promotion to Nuka Cola.
---
 Got ahold of a 2* Exploder 30% to Animals Handmade and am most of the way to converting from Rifle.
---
 Just a beastly thing, and so much fun. Not quite the hoot my knives are, but getting there. ;)
---
I think it recaptures that “fresh from the vault” feeling which is one of the best parts of Fallout.
---
It's a challenge and I love that. Another is a limit to mutations
---
Or make them different. Some legendary effects can be fun, but the fun ones usually aren't powerful or useful in the meta.
---
Now this whole thing was funny
---
Exactly how I play- I’ve made it to the final combats several times with that way of playing.
---
Lol at first I was thinking "why would they just make a limited time game mode in the first place" then I checked and saw it was pre alpha. I haven't tried it out yet, but I've been itching to dust off the case and put it back in. Seems like I'll try it maybe today
---
Where are you storing all that ammo?  LOL.
---
This is powerful stuff. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like your grandfather was a great person
---
Follow quests or exploring etc, not specific thing
---
Yeah, as melee, I never gave the .50 cal the time of day in Adventure, but now I wouldn't mind having one after messing around with it in NW.
---
was fine for me. I was in an NW match around that time and didn't d/c
---
Just glad I could point you in the right direction your also probably going to want the Bandolier perk to reduce ammo weight.
---
Yea psn has been having issues too
---
Oh man, I didn't even know you could do this. Definitely seems like a broken thing, limiting the distance is gonna have to happen at least.
---
Crashes are still but a much lower rate than release. No loss of progress though so it's not too heartbreaking unless you had a workshop. 
---
And the quests are a little weird. They have trouble updating on server sometimes it seems. 
---
But glad you're playing!  And sounds like you're enjoying it!
---
I get lvl76 yaoguais at my camp
---
Haha, sometimes Survival can be so much fun.
---
Still, and I feel bad for telling you this now... the milk a brahmin part of the challenge could be done on Adventure...
---
It's a lot harder for Bethesda to control the narrative on a platform like Facebook.  Here on Reddit, if there is a negative comment about the game, the paid Bethesda social media people just down vote the comment until it's buried.  On Facebook, the comments are sorted by the time it was posted so they can't be buried.  It's a much more accurate thermometer to gauge how people really feel about the game.
---
On the bad side of things not too many players do newer events like sheepsquach or imposter or even arkos
---
What would it be like trying to play NW as a level 20? I've put a lot of points into AGI so that I could take Marathoner.  And a lot of points into INT for the skill based perks.
---
That doesn't help me much against a player with END 10, I imagine.  I'm only at END 2 because the NPC combat is stupid easy in this game in Adventure mode.  The amount of damage you take feels like playing Fallout 4 on the very easiest setting.  I've only died two times and both deaths involved getting hit by a pile of my own land mines.
---
Rad ant companion
---
While I wouldnt want the paid battle pass, id like the battle pass system, in which there are challenges to also go up in tiers and etc. Since the BR mode isnt f2p, I dont expect them to have a paid battle pass for that reason
---
The game doesn't really focus on a main story this time around, so you just gotta go explore. I recommend looking up what level you should be before entering a new zone. I'm new too and have been having a hard time finding quests that fall into my skill level. Been getting really tired of randomly having to deal with a level 50 something.
---
Frog companion as well
---
Pics?
---
Is the Hellfire for all or certain PA sets?

Oo good one too
---
I am an XBOX GOD so I figured it out after about 10 tries...
---
Even better if you can sell robots to other players
---
You can tame a brahmin as well if you find them in a random encounter (I found mine at the Southern end of Thunder Mountain's lake, also found a tameable cat there after the brahmin was eaten) - you can have two wandering around if you build a fertilizer producer
---
Are you in Survival? Get out of Survival and into Adventure. It's like the same thing, but you can have Pacifist on so they can't really kill you unless you attack them, or get into a workshop battle.
---
This is a click bait title and should be taken down.
---
Turn on mic and work with your group if possible. I make top three pretty easily just by staying with a pack of 2-4 people. You'll almost always outnumber your enemies who are probably soloing.
---
Here's the Hellfire description (will appear in the Atomic Shop once you've unlocked the reward with your level progress): "Feed the flames with Power Armor Hellfire paint!  This is a unique skin  that completely alters the appearance of your Power Armor, and can be  equipped to all Power Armors."
---
My username is JediDaniel
---
I like that idea.  Other feeds use that and it works well
---
Can someone explain to be what "ping system" and "pinging" means? Lol
---
Hi! Not OP but I was pretty close to posting this myself until I saw this. The same exact thing is happening to me and I don’t think it’s a false notification. 
---
1: my selected character (i double checked name and overseer rank in main menu and NW lobby) is the right one
---
2: I recorded and remembered my other characters levels in case it was mistakenly giving levels to another character
---
3: My selected character in adventure mode was close to leveling 
---
4: I played NW matches on him and it did give me the notification 
---
5: I go to adventure mode and he’s at the same level, but it is giving me caps (thanks for the caps btw!) 
---
6: I play adventure mode until he levels (and then some) but the NW xp never adds on
---
7: I’ve done this like 3 times so yeah
---
Thanks! Hope this was helpful
---
You need them to register on your camera for the vertibot/cargobot and not their debris either.  Collision Course event always spawns a Cargobot that will drop in the supply cache, when it lands with the crate, that's the perfect photo op.
---
It's a lot different considering it's a multiplayer game.
---
Maybe not directly, but teammates can place things in team camps....and placing then using the thing that the teammate cannot build themselves is totally legal....
---
Nothing against arranging a transaction of some sort, even though it isn't available as a direct sale option....
---
They'll probably add more stuff
---
Explore. Do whatever you wish. Hop in on nearby events. Do workshop defense stuff. Claim workshops. 
---
Just... be a wastelander.
---
At one point I couldn't change my emote wheel as the Expand (Q) was greyed out. Restart fixed it and now I have th gift emote back.
---
let's hope for the best, luckily i run a medic build already so charisma 15 will work wonders, i'm already considering a possible build for it, that is if i get lucky (which i usually don't)
---
Your entire title is unnecessary.
---
Just ask if you should try again
---
Non-identifying. I work in corporate. I'm careful of this stuff.
---
Whenever I don't like a game, I just stop playing. I don't ask people to convince me to keep playing unless I deep down really like the game and can't admit it?
---
Stick to the forest at first. South of the Toxic Valley, north of the Ash Heap. Once you start noticing that you're killing everything in one or two hits, and ammo is never a concern... widen your exploration radius a bit, until it DOES become a concern again.
---
I find that slow expansion is the way to go.
---
That is what makes this BR special. I have played a few rounds of Apex Legends, but I suck. Here, it doesn't matter. It doesn't feel like an eSport. It is laid back. I just build a shelter in the sky and turtled and got fortunate with 3 or 4 straight circles. Went I finally was forced down with 6 of us left, I couldn't really hold my own (no armor), but still made it to 4th.
---
I also like that it has some RPG elements by keeping SPECIAL. That is an anti-esport thing to do, but it makes it more fun for me.
---
HAHA! Well you did good with that one ,good to know for future reference
---
I am always in adventure and the only thing pacifist does for you is get you killed while you cant fight back.  And even though they cant hurt you it's still really, really annoying when they start throwing grenades and shooting you over and over and over. Like I said I really wish I had, had just a couple of positive experiences with them.
---
I have 2 accounts, I dump it on a mule then refill every once in a while.
---
Girl weapon? Not cool.
---
I am sure lots of girls in this game could whoop ur ass.
---
Everyone is just playing the new mode rn
---
There's brahmin elsewhere on the map.  But to protect innocent moo moos I'm not naming locations!
---
I finished it, now I only got 1 tadpole badge showing.
---
Huh, I run higher FPS as well but never 180 so I haven't run into this. I know the engine absolutely hates going above 60, but since its capped server side we can get away with it. 
---
Does make me wonder actually if I have run into this. Coming up the stairs from turning in Tech Data I'll get stuck pretty much every time...and since its indoors the FPS should be higher than say outside roaming around.
---
I've heard rumors that placeable "junk" is coming to CAMPs, and gnomes would be included in such an update. Dont know how true it is, though.
---
They’re giving 20 atoms to play for 7600hrs. I doubt they’ll give 2000 atoms for getting to level 100. I’d be nice, but ain’t happening
---
Did you see the couple of videos of players going through the world and under it in NW? Pretty wild! You see players literally traveling under the world then popping up to kill people!
---
Or how about seeing four different players running around with their own Piper.  All of them spitting out the same  canned dialog in quick succession as each player arrives at the particular location that triggers the dialog.
---
You can't see players on the map if they are sneaking.  If you are Wanted, you can't see anyone.
---
The free week forces the game to spin up a lot of world instances, so you'll probably find that there are many low-levels and a variable number of total players.  You can always quit back to the main menu and hit play again and it will connect you to a different server.
---
In the process of converting my main to Heavy!
---
no worries it's going to be permanent.
---
The one you have to drink is  in your inventory as "Vintage nukashine" not "Nukashine"
---
I think well see it pop back up when they add displaying items into our camps. I think that level of personalization of camps is a lot buggier than they intended so theyre probably sorting all pf that out before turning it back on
---
Easy buddy we just got the canvas bag from like a 8 months ago
---
I think he ment 20 atoms per level after 100.
---
I'm lucky enough to have found a Bloodied Explosive Automatic Combat Rifle. It's sat in my stash for a while, looks like it's time to use it :)

Here’s a link that [might help](https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;hl=en-gb&amp;ei=NewDXbWKA4ii1fAPkeSJyA0&amp;q=false+sense+of+entitlement)

I like this, but am not sure it would work because the radio is live for everyone. Not sure how they would get that in there for those who buy them, and those who don’t, but I like the idea.
---
Oh my gosh thank you I’m so freakin stupid!
---
I prefer bloodied tank mode, but am working on a sniper :)
---
While it does suck that it happened, may I offer some advice? Always stash your junk before engaging in PvP
---
Were u in survival cause if so I'm sorry.
---
Won 3 games yesterday I'm so hooked!!! Skyrim br would be insane.
---
I don't think so. people kept telling me it was vats, not hacks
---
At least you have learned earlier than later. Don't carry junk around if you are going to PvP
---
Go full Commando - its a lot of fun.  Its literally almost painful to play a Rifleman build after that.  I changed one character to Commando, after my 2nd showed me the ways of Commando, then built a VATS Rifleman for a 3rd.  Totally not crazy about my 3rd character.  Since the first 2 are more Commando secondaries, I'm thinking I might go full out with a Commando primary build for my 4th or 5th.
---
What??  Are you saying you think they're actually testing something?  *(Sarcasm intended LOL)*
---
I'll probably get canned because "dud" is the first 3 letters of "dude" which is "offensively identifying". I'll risk it :)
---
Jeez the mode isnt even a week old let alone fully released.
---
Ray Charles was a sharpshooter. Just watch The Blues Brothers.
---
Please make Survival like this and I'll fucking live there.
---
It's incredible you people caused an up-rise about this meaningless bag.
---
I personally try to always drop stuff off at my stash every chance I get, wether it's at my base or a train station. I always drop stuff off before I do any kind of mission. Just in case.
---
that would be great, I would love more random items to decorate my camp
---
80 levels of nothing but vats has me all Fucked up. 
---
I didn't even know there was an aim down sights option.. /s
---
I wasnt even engaging. That was what sucked so much. I was just doing missions and these guys kept following us around. Literally shot at me whe. I was doing my fire breather conditioning test. I finally snapped then they blow us up and steal our shit. I tried killing one if then to get my stuff back but he closed app I guess. It sucks but I guess I can get it back.
---
No one knows for sure, but the in-game title screen has been updated to say "Nuclear Winter pre-BETA will stay on line after June 17 for players who own Fallout 76."
---
Adventure :(
---
Also didn't make sense why they would call it the nuclear winter update then temporarily remove it a week later.
---
You say you people like you have any knowledge about me.
---
I sat there and didn't care. I support my ticket and never spoke a word out. So, actually you're wrong Lmao.
---
Dogmeat/pets are almost guaranteed to be a thing. Why? Because Dogmeat = atom shop cosmetic skins = $$$.
---
Just a question of when.
---
Lol hopefully they are and haven’t just decided to turn it off forever because it’s too much work for a limited item..... I like to be optimistic tho
---
Just started playing yesterday.
---
Oh ok your story sounds exactly like what I did yesterday
---
Hey, when you pay $200 for a collectors edition, you expect to get things as described!
---
If you’re on Xbox send me a message to either SaltClaw or Saltacus or GramboTheUnholy
---
You can look the Xbox group up at “The Veteran Fallout Community” . 
---
The Facebook groups are closed groups not open to the public and only to the group. 
---
We use messenger to let others know we’re on or when we will be. Otherwise I don’t use Facebook like you. 
---
DM me here and ill square you away. It’s not a requirement to be part of the Facebook group.
---
Unfortunately, the snapping part was you engaging
---
Always stash your junk. Even if it's at a train station. Just like saving ever other minute in a regular game. In FO76 it is Stash Stash Stash, instead of Save Save Save.
---
No beards with it either.
---
Managed to turn around a bad match. You know the ones, every case has a crossbow or 44 in it, all your team scatter and die; total omnishambles. Spent most of it creeping around, muttering to myself and avoiding big firefights. The one thing that did go right is I found a briefcase and slowly managed to track down 4 codes. Nuke mopped up all but 2 players, I sorted the rest.
---
I normally sell plans at like 20-30 caps.
---
Gear and weaps at 100-200 for 1 star depending on its perks.
---
Gear and weaps at 200-1000 for 2 star depending on perks. A bloodied explosive weap would go much higher though for example.
---
3 star stuff i usually scrip or give to buds if they need.
---
Generally i keep low prices then have one item for a whale to buy. Right now its a tse pipe bolt action with 90% reduced weight for like 20k lol. Its prob too high but it weighs almost nothing so i can wait around for a max cap person to buy bc of FOMO.
---
P.S. Most of us have been there, done that. I still recall staring forlornly into the abyss of a giant fissure where my poor little sack of goods clung to the wall 10 feet down....
---
What size shoes do you wear I'm looking for a pair. 😂
---
it does reflect it now, I have a 2 shot missile launcher with rank 5 demo it does 1k+ dmg
---
A little Dogmeat waiting for you at your camp when you return back home? Oh god, yes please!
---
Turn on and keep on Pacifist mode and make sure anyone else you are teamed with has it on as well. 
---
After level 5 it turns off so you have to turn it back on. 
---
Once you do your shots or theirs don’t do damage so you can’t be killed UNLESS you take a workshop.
---
That stapling the fidget spinner game format of the moment onto a broken dead game is sad?
---
I like the idea of special survival mode perks. I
---
So shooting me earlier and me not retaliating didnt cakk for a shot at some point? My point being, just leave new players alone. It doesnt make you cool because you're higher level with big ass guns. I respect players who grind but not the ones who use their op weapons on noobs just so they can feel good.
---
Same thing I was thinking. Instances are so small, it doesn't take many players to fill a server.
---
Nah it's staying for good
---
Assorted lights plan. Will be a brown hanging bulb, use it to set color.
---
The first part doesn't make much sense... have to tried Pacifist? It negates a large majority of damage, but only if you don't engage. If you damage them in any way - they can kill you. 
---
My buddy and I learned this the easy way - he had Pacifist on and I had it off at around level 10. Some 70 something thought it would be fun to launch a mini nuke at us - I died, but my buddy had a large amount of health left. Guy launched 2 more mini-nukes, and then began shooting my buddy. Buddy got tired of it and shot him - let's just say my buddy didn't last long after that.
---
Yes, it's annoying, but just like we tell our kids - ignore them and they'll stop. React and they will continue. I hope if you continue, the great people in this community find you and change your mind like they did ours 😊
---
Yeah I feel the same about pvp. I fund this mode pretty thrilling. And honestly as long as you provide team mates cover you are already doing a good job and don't require a mic. I had a really bad stutter growing up but luckily I had some professional help for it in school.
---
It's a new and fancy helmet you then hit them with the ladle.
---
I am definitely one of those haters!!!!  
---
I watched E3 last year and was devastated at what I was seeing for FO 76. I then read the reviews when the game came out and experienced the 'Reddit Hate' for this game. I burned with anger at what I was perceiving as a horrible game.    
---
Needless to say, I spent my time in Rocket League and elsewhere.  
---
Fast forward a year and I have not even considered FO 76. Not even once. Then along comes this free week to try the game. What could it hurt I say. I download it an 2.3 trillion hours later (or so it seems since I can not stop playing) I am in love with this game and cannot put it down. I am having so much fun!  
---
I have played it on XBOX with my friends and on PC with my family and just simply love it.  
---
This game needs to come to Gamepass for others to experience it!!!!
---
Where can I find that?
---
Is that like passive mode?
---
If I enable the built in vsync it caps my fps at like 40 and looks like garbage, and the issue stops, but I refuse to play at that kind of fps. If I use nvida vsync to limit the fps to my refresh rate, the issue persists since the cap is 240 for my monitor. The issue happens inside more than outside since my fps sky rockets.
---
YES! This is my only real complaint about this mode so far! I would enjoy it much more if I had the choice to play against other solo players! :)
---
I've learned a lot just by watching people after I die. Lessons like "hide in a bush" and "don't be loot greedy" and "your team means nothing" and "it's better to ride the edge of a nuke than the edge of the ring".
---
take a lesson learned.  stash your junk.  
---
Also, it's easy to re acquire wood and steel.  Both are super abundant.
---
Ah yeh boi
---
DOES DAD KNOW???
---
Mine dropped a couple of times eventually they did show back up so just be patient and let's see what happens.
---
Why does my adventure mode Special stat have an effect on NW. There are perk cards I can't equip because of this.
---
I wonder if you keep the tape to be able to listen to it in adventure.
---
Your fault. You engaged.
---
honestly, there shouldn't even be a limit on caps
---
Think responder bot sells. Cheaper options are events and player vending.
---
No, sorry, I do tend to channel him though when talking about Fallout.
---
That is my next goal is to drop a nuke soloing. I found a briefcase but could not find a single nuke card after.
---
Oh I agree with you that you were dealing with a jerk. But I'd say run to the nearest stash box before you get some revenge. Which good job killing him for being new
---
What section in camp do I find it
---
My guess is that eventually companions might be expanded to follow you around, but simultaneously I can see why that wouldn't be the case either.  Why? Because players take the place of companions and I'd guess they don't want to make it to where you can just beef up a companion and be a two-man wrecking crew (not to mention they'd have to do a lot of extra work for the AI and so on).
---
Possibilities. Johnny Cage, shades and plasma weapons?
---
It only took me two server hops to find Billings unowned. I think most people are in NW.
---
Propaganda? OP actually played the game and hated it. They weren't a victim of propaganda.
---
This shows that the devs have worked hard to make the game better, not that the game wasn't a mess at launch. I didn't hate the game at launch, but I also didn't find it at all compelling.
---
What the heck is this "ping" stuff I keep hearing about. Someone please explain. :(
---
NP. 
---
Get on the doh! boat with me.
---
I've had the quest since it first became available, just never got around to doing it.  Finally decided to do so a couple nights ago.  Went through the same experience....Couldn't find it in inventory, went back and searched the relevant locations, reread the poster in the train station, revisited the locations, found a bottle, but couldn't pick it up....  cussed a lot, then found the "Vintage nukashine" marked with a diamond...
---
Bottoms up!
---
Yeah, really long time. So many funny lines. 
---
When the Deaf guys leaves the girl, "Stay in touch..you will write won't you?" Little jokes like that.
---
Also ELasers are vastly less efficient in VATS than without VATS so you are not only rude but also wrong :D
---
Thanks for the tip. I'll give it another go and stay away from others.
---
Also don't ever hesitate to duck and run for cover.
---
Lights, should be top option, 4th or 5th to the right I think.
---
No this is completely false and you are riding on a hype train to push your agenda literally all it shows is that people have more fun when they have a chance. In pvp with legendaries most people don't have good gear so they cry about pvp not being fun. When if you just put some effort into getting decent gear and having a decent build then you'd have much more of a chance and have more fun. But most people's adventure characters run around with thru hiker animal friend and hacker on all the time and using weight reduction armour  or excavator armour then expect to do well in pvp. This mode removes all because its too hard for the majority of the player base or they don't want to spec their character into combat.  
---
What it also shows is that people will do pvp when there is incentive , there are lots of cometic rewards and an entirely new levelling system and it also looks like you learn more lore through levelling up. They need too add better incentive to the other pvp mode survival. Like there is literally no one playing that now because of the caps reward nerf(also the hype for NW obs contributes to this), There is a leaderboad with no rewards for being on it except "bragging rights" - thats not a reward, all you get is shitty legendaries with the occasional decent one. There needs to be a good reason to go into survival besides a little extra xp and the occasional decent legendary. MORE CAPS REWARD FOR KILLS , GET XP for KILLING PLAYERS , cosmetic rewards for kill streaks and icons or other titles bonus cap multipyiers for kill streaks and survival time etc.
---
Alright bring on the downvotes for speaking the truth , cheers.
---
&gt; Go full Commando - its a lot of fun
---
Oddly, my wife won't take this advice :P
---
Switched up my Rifleman already and it's just....wow
---
you can do passive mode or just not fight. your fault. anyway wood go to pricket fort up north. 2 large wood stacks there. with woodchuck you can easiky get 400 wood in seconds. steel kill super mutants. i think they at west tek. pick up all the weapons and scrap em using the scrapper perk. you get like 3-400 steel.
---
This is what I'm talking about. This person needs this. So shut up and know your place
---
So it's not ending the 17th?
---
Oh don't worry folks like Jim Sterling will keep reminding us that this happened.
---
oh no, I didnt mean *you* were jon, just asking jokingly if you watch him :) and seems you do, all good
---
Especially considering that the strongest survival player I met so far is a lady.
---
You have to get real close to the downed person. If you have a stimpack, it’ll prompt to push and HOLD whatever is the same as X on PS4.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
You did it! You killed Adventure Mode. :)
---
I've gotten tank killer, but no other rifle dmg perks yet. I do have master shotgunner/shotgun surgeon that I run, and managed to pick up bloody mess. Ironclad takes up my 3 END slots. 
---
I never even bothered with nerd rage in NW, as without some type of mitigation, and limited radaway/stimpacks, a dang mirelurk can 1 shot you.
---
That's not griefing and you fought back so it's your fault you lost your junk. If you don't want that happening again always have pacifist on and ignore people like them.
---
Either that or he played someone else's copy. Or is now buying for PC/another platform.
---
Seems like most people who complain about vats and legendaries just lack where others strive and vice versa for people who have legendaries and depend on vats. Knowing those mechanics are present in survival mode I tend to strategize around them. Stealth boys. Berry mentats. Crouching chameleon armor. Actually aiming and getting some hits in. Grenades and using vats to explode the grenade to explode when you want is amazing. Use orbital strikes you’ll make people run from their cover. After playing pc for years and now playing Xbox aiming with a controller is a skill not many have. I still think it’s difficult but I agree that vats is a crutch. Which is why heavy gunners are terrible builds for pvp. Majority of the players and friends I interact with in game use vats all the time. Hunting for legendaries has kept me playing. It’s made trading and grinding for caps a daily routine. I think the proveyor should have been a different style. I hate getting useless armor and weapons. Saving script up to change one of 2 or add stars to items would of been so much more fun. I like legendary weapons. It’s the end game for fallout. I think survival should be a more difficult adventure mode with  non transferable players. Like you have a survival character and a adventure mode character. Making rewarded survival weapons more useful and sought after. Make the challenges more difficult and less silly like craft a light in a workshop and cook a meal while drunk. Take away leader boards. It would make running into a high level character muuuuch more intimidating. That would also make people be less malicious in survival. All you role players could really align your selfs with factions and beable to help others or raid them. Make AI more difficult and drop better gear. Dropping your junk and aid should still be looted but have some kind of mechanic like lockpick/hacking  so it takes more time and having those perks viable.  If you killed a player or watched them get eaten by a deathclaw say you kill the death claw see the dropped loot and go to attempt to take what’s in the bag not knowing what’s in there but you attempt it anyway and then get ambushed by the player coming back to get their loot they lost. Pvp is now engaged and creates a whole new experience and risk in the game. Higher risk higher reward right?  Not the 12 caps you get from spawn killing someone while you use vats from the other side of the map while using chameleon armor and a bloodied explosive lever action. 
---
Obviously Nw and survival are still in beta. I see and read a lot of the things people wish they would change. We all want a perfect game but in the world we live in everyone wants something different. I give Bethesda a huge amount of respect for putting out a game filled with bugs issues exploits and stability issues and being humble enough to attempt to constantly fix it and appease their fan base and customers. 
---
Everyone has an opinion so nothings ever gonna be perfect. Vats has been in the fallout series since the very first game of the series. It’s part of fallout. It’s not going anywhere. It’s a lot different then solo games. I honestly never used it in 76 for the longest time because I was used to the game pausing and allowing you to take a more strategized approach to getting out of a sticky situation. But because this is a mmo game with an open world they put it in the best way they could. There are perks to make it more useful and some weapons have balance to make it be less useful. The issue with taking it from survival mode is people will just go to adventure to pvp. So they can use vats. And say you disable it from non AI enemies there will just be more melee builds. 
---
We all can agree when you want to pvp and you want to try and win and how damn frustrating it is being one shot and sent back to a loading screen and loose all yr junk and the aid you’ve been hoarding I think adding a legendary effect or a perk that is only available in pvp/survival such as the assassins attribute being able to lower vats chance or disable others vats probability would be better. Shit the syringer needs some serious revamping and they could make that gun soooo much more useful for pvp. Some one brought up being able to heal players and take away their rads with it when you find bloodied builds attacking you. Or being able to temporarily disable their legendary armor effects would be absolutely amazing.
---
I did this for awhile when I first got the game before settling somewhere permanent. Gets expensive quick though. I would play during the day in game and once night hit I'd set up a little fire/ sleeping bag. Go out for a smoke, bathroom, whatever then come back and tear down the camp.
---
None of nuclear winter as we experience it is canon so it wouldn't matter, aside from that pre war vertibirds existed even before we see them in 4 with an exhibit in 3
---
Go make me a sandwich.
---
I don't know what Photomode you are using, but the one I use can only move the camera about 4 feet away from my character. It's not actually *possible* to move my camera "pretty significant distances".
---
I finished the first course at camp venture because I googled how to get there and then no notifications or map markers show up I guess we were supposed to Google all of this stuff and this is absolutely terrible coding!!!
---
Eh no damage so who cares?
---
Lol I've been playing since November.  It's not that they even scratch me it's just obnoxious behavior cutting into my limited play time.  And I'm sorry but pacifist mode just means when I'm forced into pvp, which still does on occasion happen, I cant shoot back and die.  I dont believe it does now or has ever dampened incoming damage.  I could be completely off here but that has been my experience more than twice.
---
And all they ever get from me is a thumbs down.  I dont fight them, what would be the point?  Oh look you got one shotted again and I'd still be wasting my play time and ammo lol
---
It was a group effort really
---
Than they are clearly ignorant to online PvP and the armies of sad cheaters ;(
---
I 100% want to be an ass and nuke Morgantown with a pile of noobs in it...this Raider PA is starting to mess with me lol
---
I use vats in a pinch and that's about it. None of the other shooters I play have anything like that so I refuse to spoil muself
---
Does this mean the double XP coming up will apply in NW?
---
*pokes you non stop*
---
sorry, when would be the best time to ask this question?
---
I recall jumping through lots of hoops to get FO4 to play nice with my 144Hz, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. Lots of playing around in the nvidia control panel (think I never got the lockpicking to slow down however). 
---
Could try Riva Tuner, thats like the only software I can think of with a limiter built in.
---
Unfortunately I don't think the engine in its current state will ever really consider 72+ FPS good. Not sure if its due to being console ready or just it being old.
---
Yes this has happened to me and my husband twice now on ps4 since update
---
Okay, gonna keep this in mind for next time I need it thank u!
---
help you with that? i dont play BR, but do play adventure.
---
Yes, you can server hop.
---
Simply log off and log back on. If in a group, leave group and repeat above steps. Then have your gf join your server from the buddy list.
---
Hope that helps.
---
I've come to the conclusion people will complain about everything. So I just play the game and make my own decisions.
---
I just want a Miss Nanny to tell me bedtime stories at home.
---
No. Just no. Go play fort night then.
---
And it feels kinda sad...  but yeah.  Spawn near group, shadow group, stay hidden, be in top 5, die with no kills.
---
Story of my brief fo76nw life...
---
only have 4 wins but haven’t played with actual teammates it’s so fun
---
I’d vend them for 1000 a piece, and only because of the explosive effect.
---
It's... A game.
---
What suggestions didn’t you like?
---
BR hype train all board! Next stop BR season passes! Lets do this to give more money to developer so he can make more great content!
---
If we have found it in game, allow us to purchase for 20-50 atoms. More options and more money. Plus a bonus for those of us that have been here for a while
---
I agree. So many low level players wondering around. I moved my long standing camp near Vault 76 and have had so much traffic. I've been putting lvl 1 BOS Recon Rifles in my vending machine for super cheap with 100 rounds of 308 on occasion for people to snag up.
---
Its also fun to stalk them.
---
Or at the very least remove the hit notifications.
---
It's neither dead nor broken but ok
---
No why does the pink sprinkles have to be in this, I was saving my atoms :(
---
I'll have to look into Rivia tuner, maybe cap my fps at 144, I've been messing with all of the graphic settings trying to get the game to look better so my fps wouldn't be so high, but I've ended up just making the whole game blurry and washed out.
---
I haven't verified this after P10 so these could be still bugged:
---
\- **Chemist**: Shoot 3 types of animals with the Syringer didn't register.
---
\- **Chemist**: Craft Plasma Grenades - the plans are not in the game, bugged or a really rare Ash heap event reward.
---
\- **Musician**: play music instrument at X didn't work.
---
These are still bugged:
---
\- **Leatherworker**: Deathclaw Fur are a rare drops from containers/gulpers based on reports, I still have not found them on Deathclaws.
---
Technically doable, but practically almost no chance:
---
\- **Tadpole**: **Medic**: Stimpak Diffuser - I haven't seen this being sold by players so far, maybe because it is too hard to obtain.
---
These were not bugged for me:
---
\- **Plant corn**: I had crops at my camp already when the DLC became live so this checked out by default.
---
This guy. 100% genius.
---
Or none of the above and I picked it up on redbox to try out first lol
---
Are you unaware of the concept of a vidoe game having an annoying aspect that could easily be fixed? Does this... elude you?
---
Yes but a bit more refined instead of only lasting 30 seconds or only when immobile it is a half way.
---
I've had this problem an extreme amount of times, I kinda like the game but the constant ctd's is a big turn off.
---
Redbox is a thing my dude.
---
Where did you hear there are big plans for BR?
---
Need to go say this on the r/Fallout sub my guy. They're still going "hurr Durr duffle kerfuffle"
---
That might do better.
---
So more armor to hide in bushes with. Cool.
---
I’m guessing by the response none of them? I wouldn’t mind a ping to teammates at least.
---
any E 50 cal is worth 2k. that suppresors is prolly 2.5, while that exterminator's is just 2k-1.5k
---
The punching everyone does in the lobby should give the equivalent of an unarmed bobblehead buff in the match to whoever lands the most punches.
---
He's talking out his ass I think. None of what you said seemed related to fortnite.
---
You're almost lvl 10. You can just pass through the laser grid, and never get punched again.
---
I've never seen a rocket launcher..
---
I know PC gamers who play all single player games on PC but will only play multiplayer on consoles because cheating is so rampant.
---
I'm looking forward to that.
---
IT was either armor or silences weapon noise, but realized silencing weapon noise would be a Bit OP in the game mode.
---
Not sure its really that relevant, but I post it in here anyways (I suspect since your already getting pretty high FPS, this would only increase it, aaaand solve nothing) 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqtokr/fallout_76_pc_version_graphic_presets_explanation/
---
I hav the same issues. Came back after couple of month on PC. 3 times I played deep into a quest and boom. disconnect and progress gone. Why in the fu\*\*\*\*\* world should I continne to play this game? I don't have the time to do every quest 5 times to get them count. It pure sucks right now.
---
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!  
---
SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
---
Yeah, but we've got to be prepared because once it's released, it's gonna be main focus till they get there main bugs fixed
---
The Ash Heap is a real butt kicker under lvl 50 so you did good
---
Oh, I honestly can live without the paints, I'd rather prefer a dark colour to my PA than walk around like a neon light display. But yeah, hope Beth doesn't make them NW only obtainable, I just also saw the tweet about them keeping the sneak peek preview for another week, so I guess we'll see if some people advance enough to give an answer.
---
just my opinion but yes
---
So, we're just making shit up to stress about now?
---
Bethesda please DON'T steal my cat!
---
This is the likely answer
---
You can start it from your terminal.
---
Good info. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6VhBPehTctlszsrRCIPZP3/newcomers-guide-fallout-76
---
I've been dabbling in battle royales since day-z and this is the one I have played the most, easily.
---
Hooray!
---
Damn how much brahmin meat do you need?
---
I've been on Adventure for the majority of the week, I sprinkle in a little Nuclear Winter here and there. I think its just because there are so many new players in the servers.
---
Da fuck is a battle pass?
---
I find killing creatures seems to be a good way of getting them. The obvious problem there is the noise. Loot and run.
---
It's fun but it crashes A LOT when playing multiplayer
---
No, the problem is when i do that, I get a marker to the robot, but when I go there and talk to it, the mission doesn't start.
---
The bot even said the right sentence once, but the mission didn't start.
---
And if  I keep talking he answers a cycle of sentences but never get the mission.
---
Game of the year easy
---
My experience exactly. I was just in a game with a friend who was doing a horde while I was refilling my vendors. My vending machines were empty and I lost around 100 lbs of items. The horde never showed on my map. My vending machines needed to be scrapped and replaced, as well. I'm having a horrible time with this game lately. Glitch Simulator.
---
Hmmm. I guess I don't know what's going on, then.
---
If you have Nvidia turn on adaptive or fast sync.
---
Nah they all get posted pretty regularly.
---
Too bad photo mode won't help my trash aim
---
Oh wait is it a timed event? I haven’t had a chance to try it out yet
---
Yeah noticed how steeply the cost goes up just moving camp a few times when I was trying to get a nice roadside spot for my pub. ( happy cake day )
---
There is higher ranks than 100. One terminal needs 110.
---
Serious Question... 
---
During the 2 mins while in Vault or during the 2-20 minute hustle, while surrounded by 50 other enemies, a ring of fire and all in all constant danger...
---
Where. The. Hell. You. Fit. In. Time. For. A. Pip. Boy. Game.?
---
No seriously lol - you want to find a quiet spot, hide and play wastelad while all others get their butts handed?
---
Lmao
---
That's as brilliant as "can't believe i read this"
---
Everything can be controlled from a hotkey even if it doesn't say so in the interface. And they seem to vary by menu. For example, in your pip boy, you can hit A and D to cycle between different sections. But in a vendorbot, you use Z and C to do the same thing. And in the camp building screen, it's the left and right arrow keys. There's a dedicated key to opening up your pip boy directly to each major category (status, inventory, radio, etc) over on the right side with J, K, I, M(ap), etc. You can also use F and G to make scroll bars jump when setting quantities or pricing (wherever there's a horizontal scroll bar) and I think you can use Z and C also on those to jump at a different increment on the horizontal scrollers. Like, one pair jumps by 25% the other jumps by 10%. 
---
So everything you can do with a controller is mapped to a keyboard key. Just might not be where you expect it. It just needs better context sensitive hotkey display and more consistency overall.
---
Exactlly. Fake op or fake post
---
If it's not enjoyable and it doesn't make you a better person then it is a waste of time in my book.
---
Beyond what others have posted some enemies drop caps, supermutants come to mind though it's usually just a few per enemy.  
---
Also buying from NPC vendors refills some of their caps.  So if you were planning to buy something expensive like 1k+ plans, a serum, etc make sure you first deplete the 1400 caps and buy the expensive item once they are at or close to 0 caps.  The expensive purchase will refill some of their caps.
---
I like the idea
---
Had my first explosive drop around level 200. Good luck lol.
---
 Yes but we should gather together as a community to show how much we hate the game we all play so much time playing. While continuing to play it, but hating it. Cos we hate it, but play it. Because sense!
---
Look at your map. A lot of times it doesn’t really help you figure out the clean up is in Watoga
---
Have my downvote.
---
    &gt; git gud

    git: 'gud' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

    Launching default Bowser to display HTML ...

    fatal: failed to launch browser...

...and I still don't know this 'git gud'...
---
Well, not a big deal anyway, the reward for the mission 99% of the time was the knife paint, but some easy caps and XP were nice too.
---
I mean in the main lobby. Because all holotapes already stay with you so it just causes more work to get rid of it after the match starts. Besides it’s funny
---
I dont know what your talking about i love getting one shot by someone i cant even see
---
If you're feeling generous and want to donate the old lesser quality bag to another fallout fan, dm me. 😄
---
I do. Started last night. The whole level 3 !
---
You can, go to the atomic shop and hit the favorite for NW button
---
Tried both, issue still happens :(
---
Deathclaw hides can be found in metal boxes and footlockers .  I have good luck at Fort Defiance. 
---
What they need to fix is the Kiddie corner cabin daily
---
Cry more scrublord. Lols. Dupers suck.
---
Nice try.
---
I don’t hate it even a little bit.
---
gets boring after you've done everything. no one does imposter sheepsquatch cause they dont want to spend 2k caps. no one does arctos pharma. sbq is boring ammo dump. purveyor legendary spawns sucks way too often. Badges are bugged.
---
maybe when they release npcs it will pick up better but the forst dlc kinda sucked.
---
and ugly
---
Same here on PC, at least in adventure mode. Maybe there's a bug that lets you go significant distances in NW though.
---
I can definitely see it being used to give an unfair advantage though, hiding under an overhang and using it to watch for people, particularly if you tweak the FOV and turn off the distance-based fuzzing.
---
No, I don't mean I can't see where the targets are, it's the mission itself not being started.
---
I'll try on another toon and if it doesn't work either then I guess I'll have to put a ticket.
---
I don't see why there needs to be an inventive to play a game mode you enjoy.
---
No, you can’t
---
If you’re on PC I’ll give you 2500 for the explosive suppressors. nmprogue. I’ll be on in 4 hours or so
---
Wow I didn't even think of this tactic.
---
Why do you play it if you hate it?
---
If you have a single duped item they have no way of knowing it's duped. When they bad people they have to have over 100k of a single rare item. If your brother got that much stuff from someone he should have been a bit suspicious.
---
/vigorously takes notes
---
Are you sure? I’ve seen people in lobby with stuff that wasn’t the jumpsuit
---
I can see that occurring. 
---
Instanced interactions that involve the NPC companions saying things along the lines of:
---
*"I'll meet you at [insert location]."* 
---
*"I'm going to look around a bit more, you go ahead."*
---
Just don't use controller when you play NW :)
---
Brotherhood Outcast T-51 skin. A suprise, but a welcome one :)
---
I'll just be thrilled if I can add NPCs to my camp even if they can't follow me around.  Add a little more life to the camp.
---
Saw Mental Fox on YouTube have a similar problem.
---
That's what I do and it never spawns
---
We did it reddit!

---
Well, he is a BR pro and mice are definitely superior to gamepads when it comes to aiming. And it's not really a matter of shame if you are not as good as a guy who spends his life playing BR games.
---
I honestly laughing as hell right now imagine sneak under the new river gorge bridge, settle down, eat something, drink a bit, pop a rad-x and play patiently a round nuka tapper while all the others go on full kill mode and when the dust settle you leave the quiet spot, strech yourself a bit since long sitting isn't good for your back, have a look around and
---
**"So? Hello anyone still left? I would join then..."**
---
Welcome to the thunderdome bitches!
---
Like adventure mode, any time you get a hit on a target, you should be credited xp for the kill/down.
---
Did you look under "vintage nukashine"? I ask cause i thought i lost it for like 2 days but it was at the bottom of my list
---
Thanks !
---
I hope the ability to have a “private” or “invite only” servers will be here.
---
I started to play last night and it’s horrible experience from level 1.
---
People are just blocking your view and just jump around you firing on you.
---
Left the game after 10 mins of this BS. That should be a banable offence. 
---
Pacifist mode doesn’t solve this abuse.
---
I’ll try again until free week is over, but if I can’t just do my things ignoring other players, the game will not be for me
---
Scrounger (Luck 1): 80% chance to find extra ammo when you "search" a Nuclear Winter container.
---
Don't feed the troll. Pretty sure it's a lie.
---
thanks for the info, will try it out.
---
You can wear other costumes and apparel, but apparently not under armor
---
Do us all a favor and go away.
---
Yeah I already found it thank you though
---
Oh I love it, I just thought the caps-lock crowd needed somewhere to vent :)
---
Nor me :)
---
Well if they disconnect like that they wont get no xp.. so yea they are making it harder for you but atleast they got nothing at all but shot
---
I really need to watch Mad Max. I never seen it before.
---
It works for other apparel but not items that are marked underarmor, such as the tin foil suit.
---
That would be pay-to-play
---
They've stated multiple times they aren't going to do this. The repair kit thing was a bit feisty, but dude a paid pass? They're smart enough not to do that.
---
Do you think once the free trial is over there will still be low levels coming in? I wouldn't mind moving to the forest to help them out if I knew this trend would continue. Right now I'm helping lvl 5-12's that made their way to Whitesprings. They don't stand a chance against ghouls. I'll outfit them with armor, a new weapon, and some aid. I would prefer to outfit them BEFORE they take a stroll around the golf course.
---
bethesda has too much pride to remove legendaries from the game
---
Not this time, but we're looking into something like this for future XP events. Will keep you posted!
---
That's true too, still a scummy way to leave the match.
---
The most important thing tbh is to find the sensitivity setting that's right for you. Keep messing with it until you feel comfortable with everything you're doing.
---
Just ignore it - its how all BR games are like.  Stupid stuff while waiting to start.
---
Right, because indiscriminately killing people in a game is so much "fun."
---
Without legendaries sure, without Vats, that was balenced and an integral game mechanic!
---
Then you probably have to set it lower using afterburner or rivatuner or something. Forgot you said 240 monitor. Try setting it to like 170 and then go down in small increments if it keeps happening.
---
And bait Yongyea into making a video titled
---
"Bethesda is making fun of their fans"
---
Oh wow people are immediately disconnecting so you can't get their loot toxic behavior
---
Why is either fake?
---
Some good info: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6VhBPehTctlszsrRCIPZP3/newcomers-guide-fallout-76
---
Okay got ya lol 
---
I think we just wait a bit, maybe we get after the sneak peek the option to play while waiting.
---
(still in tears imagine playing while in mode)
---
🤫
---
24 hours?  Are you sure?  I seems to be different for me day to day getting a few hours earlier each time.
---
Yea I've had the same problems with ALL the scout missions until today.. the sludge one is the only one they havnt fixed yet
---
That's awesome! Shouldn't be too surprising, given how much positive feedback it got. Now the question is, when will we get to explore vault 51 in adventure mode? This was really the only reason not to have it in just yet
---
I just it time to learn to how to swim 😂🤣😂
---
[how to swim](https://youtu.be/EKiIplwS1ZQ) 
---
Hoping it’s not radioactive ☢️
---
It actually just occurred to me. Wouldn’t your build with shao Kahn use a sledgehammer? I’m sure the axe is stronger so maybe that’s it but a sledgehammer would be more true to the character wouldn’t it?
---
Hoping they add a war mode version of NW like pubg where you can respawn and set more dynamic match rules
---
Feel the same way. A friend nuked Vault 51 last night in Adventure just for the heck of it. It was a completely worthless nuke zone but made me feel better and gave me a laugh.
---
No one is launching nukes though.... might have to work out how to do it myself.
---
If you take photos in photo mode they will appear as custom loading screens
---
Added it, thank you.
---
Nukesdragons.com
---
&gt;  Is adventure mode obsolete now? 
---
It's a new game mode that was supposed to be a limited-time sneak peak. It's been what 5 days? Such an overreaction. I personally love it. Adventure is so much fun without a ton of players. I hope they make it 12 players max with higher stash and budget.
---
Why does there need to be an incentive?
---
This game has given me 100+ hours of entertainment and will provide at least 100 more.....    I HATE IT!!!! Screw you Bethesda!  Also Todd Howard has stupid looking hair!
---
I hate the way this game is so much fun and entertaining, almost nothing to complain about. And it takes up so much of my time away from other games that I hate even more.  I just wish they wouldn't add more stuff every few month just to keep me playing.  Oh, and whats this about the canvas bags, I hate those too..  In fact I hate everything and everybody.
---
(LOL!!)
---
Pretty sure the simple fact we've got Wastelanders coming means it's not gonna be their main focus. So far, roughly equal attention has been paid to PvE and PvP, and with a big PvE expansion like Wastelanders coming I'm not too worried about Bethesda dropping all PvE in favor of PvP focus.
---
Shroud is arguably one of the best BR players and was a pro for a long time. You should see him in apex, absolute beast
---
Dont be afraid to die
---
My first death was at like lvl 20 and i thought i would lose my gear but when u die u only drop junk items
---
You're going to be a fantastic teammate if you get lucky, most of the Charisma perks are just so good. I wish I could respecc my SPECIAL, but that would completely destroy my bloodied Heavy Weapons build in Adventure. If only I would atleast get some of the good Strength, Luck or Intelligence perks...
---
4.
---
Guess you don’t read the 10 major patches much or E3 for that matter.
---
Idk for sure, but I don’t think the servers are state specific. So it’s probably just one of the many they have open
---
I hope we do get a big initial update though for little bits of balancing, etc.
---
Please post an incident report here as well:  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
I've made it run without the launcher, So I changed the properties on Fallout76  "Run this program as an administrator" and "run compatibility mode as windows 7" seems to work but not for long crashes when I fast travel so been avoiding it longest and hour so far
---
You're a scumbag man. I've been helping new players left and right. If I ever see that I'm vats criting you in the side of the face with a Bloodied Fatman.
---
I have found i do better if i dumb it down in my mind... Start running around in 3rd person and shooting in the general direction of your target rather than trying to meticulously aim in first person. I swear it makes a difference lol.
---
My friends won't touch it till the wastelanders dlc hits
---
Every adventure server I've been on this week has been filled to the brim with new folks. On the one hand it sucks because sales at my vending machines have taken a nose dive, but on the other hand the whole east side of the map is empty so I can go farm stuff and the locations aren't picked clean.
---
Practice makes perfect. Not that the PVE is gonna be the best training but always aim for the enemies soft spot, see how fast you can get there, see if you can heavily reduce ammo expenditure that kind of thing. Challenge yourself to improve it in some way and it'll slowly fall in place. But again, nothing happens without practice ;)
---
Bit unrelated, but wth...was having a discussion with a good buddy who finally decided to try 76 (free week was genius) and he is adamantly against KB+M and prefers the controller as its a level playing field. 
---
Me, I feel like I've gone back 27 years in my motor functions using a PS4 controller (and I love the PS4 controller).
---
He can't understand why I think KB+M is superior, I honestly can't understand why he'd think controllers are heh. Just a natural gift to some.
---
Considering you already play Destiny 2 that's probably a smart move. Way too easy to end up accidentally spending hours at a time on either game
---
I'm not sure about that, but there will always be players who are less fortunate than me. I can mod their weapons, give them legendary weapons, help them with difficult places.
---
I wait to kill Prize Bot until he's finished. I always hope this will be the one time he actually gives me a prize.
---
When he doesn't, that's when I murder him.
---
It didnt really
---
1. Not really true, your brother probably duped himself or helped someone with it. I'm sorry if you're actually not lying.
---
2. Yes, there are glitches, but there's no way you encounter glitches that often.
---
3. Ran out of ideas?
---
4. Ran out of ideas?
---
5. The only thing I can agree with, even though PvP in NW feels really good without legendaries and other stuff. It's a complete mess in Survival though.
---
I am pretty sure Bethesda will never get the rights for Wanderer again. 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/kotaku.com/morally-indefensible-fallout-4-commercial-leads-to-la-1796761416/amp
---
I’d be down for that. I myself haven’t earned my backpack yet so a similar threshold could work. And yea, dog food is my lifeblood, f that. That mutt can eat Cram.
---
Same here. Only thing I don't like is how my food takes a big condition hit when I have to exit out to the main menu because a kid's crying and needs immediate attention. Or I have to exit out of an event in the middle of it due to the same thing and lose the XP and rewards even though I've probably done more to contribute than the guy camping on the roof for the whole thing. Not sure there's a solution for that though. If only Bethesda could figure out how to comfort a screaming toddler or feed a hungry baby while I take down this Sheepsquatch real quick that'd be great.
---
I'm trying but when I get throws at me and hear nothing but punches when I'm trying to hear other team members, it gets annoying.
---
I did the exact same thing. Luckily I have a ton of atoms earned in game.
---
This isnt explained anywhere and is misleading being on the same page under the same menu.
---
Same here, the nuka t shirt and jeans is what i rock cosmetically, i've found it blends great with foliage and whatnot.
---
I just feel better knowing im not the only one haha
---
They never responded to my ticket when I put it in months ago....
---
I suspect that's not allowed in NW because it would make it impossible to tell how armored your allies and enemies are.
---
Yep, just saw the news. Now I can relax with these challenges
---
I would actually like this. Even the atoms for extra slots part. 
---
Love the camp I have and don't want to rebuild but would love the ability to build another one and switch between them as I felt.
---
Im glad I waited until now to purchase it
---
Ohhh okay so it's automatic like that?
---
How is taking their Wanted mark away not helping? I teach a valuable lesson: don't loot when it says steal. Also why do you think that vats crit bloodied fatman would work? As I said, many don't know the game rules.
---
My biggest piece of advice is not to rush.  There is a main quest that sort of guides you around the map.  There's also a main side quest, so to speak, that has you tracking down holotapes.  I strongly advise not to just go from objective to objective, because eventually you'll find yourself in places you are not ready for level-wise.  Just have fun exploring.
---
Just a heads up if you are saving to buy a copy, it's on sale for $17 (walmart, Amazon, probably other places) right now. See you in the wasteland!
---
pacifist is off by default, it doesn't turn off at level 5 it was already off, you just have the effects of pacifist until level 5
---
i also have very high strenght and decent intelligence, but i need some damage perks somewhere. god i wish it was easier to choose the perks you'll get, it would be amazing to see all the builds around. for now i know for sure i need pharma farma, team medic, that perk that heal you faster and that one that heals you more. next probably life giver to have a bit of extra hp but not sure about the last two, any ideas? maybe the one that give you 50 dmg resistance if not in power armor?
---
In England there was a Christmas parlor game called “Are you there, Moriarty?”
---
Look it up and tell me if that is what you’re thinking of!
---
I wanna nuke it cause I’ve never seen it nuked yo be honest.
---
I let him finish
---
Dogmeat for life!
---
Sorry to say, but Bethesda’s track record of dealing with exploits in survival and adventure does not have me hopeful they will fix exploits in NW. 
---
If you believe that I have some oceanfront land to sell you in Arizona. 
---
I do very much hope they can patch/fix exploits/duping, but imho haven’t done a great job so far.
---
I meant it as a sort of way to bring up opinions or ideas that haven’t been prompted by a post, kinda just like a central hub for all the posts people make that are suggestions, so they have a better chance at getting some attention vs just dying in new with very few people seeing them
---
I felt the weight lifted when I read it too.  good hunting bro
---
I agree with this. It's like that first shit scared paranoid feeling when the vault door opens
---
EXACTLY thank you! And it’s not like the under armor serves any utility as it is unmodifiable
---
It's like a "season pass" for $10 that allows the player to unlock items. Imagine all the level rewards in NW locked behind $10
---
God I know this line but for the life of me I can’t remember what it is from. Help me out?
---
Oh fuck that
---
Thankyou for the heads up mate
---
I need a lot of “Git gud” I wonder if Costco sales it by the pallet?
---
I think you encountered a more rare experience as majority of interactions are good and people are helpful but people in general can be assholes so occasionally just like in life you will find one. Most of the time I don't have any problems with people and if someone shows up they usually adjust to accommodate another person being there as do I.
---
I think the influx of people who may or may not give any fucks could be raising the level of general assholes on the servers but still plenty of good people. If nothing else give it another try after free week and if you play  on ps4 hit me up.
---
Lol what?
---
So it turns out that the flamey skins are actual full skin conversion for PA, something tells me we aren’t getting real X-02 or X-03 armors
---
Which is weird because _most_ people use their real names on there.
---
Pretty sure that's the only mode you can use it in. And Survival.
---
Bu-but no one asked for this? Ri-right? /s
---
What a novel concept xD
---
I would love if we could make our own robots like in that one fallout 4 dlc
---
Yep
---
*tent
---
Don't take anything from granted. So many small things have changed from fo4 - for example, tin cans give steel and lead now. The handmade rifle uses 5.56 ammo instead of 7.62. Pre war money has weight and can't be sold now. Look through everything carefully, and explore areas thoroughly. Don't rush through the main quest, or you'll end up in the savage divide against ghouls and mutants 30 levels above you.
---
&gt;I did 3 nukes on a server, mainly as close to the Forest safe zone as possible to annoy the newbies so they can't get to Charleston and Morgantown.
---
Because you're an antagonizing type of person. I've seen your comments on the sub. You enjoy giving people a hard time, it's what makes you happy. We could use a lot less of that tbh.
---
The vocal haters are never going to let go or give Bethesda any credit.  They're going to continue polluting Facebook/Youtube/Twitch/etc. until they run out of fuel.
---
D: Is their sex one that interest you?......
---
Hahahaha respect
---
Yes I agree. Free week attract more people.
---
So far, I enjoyed graphics, music. For now I just run around exploring. I’ll see how it goes !
---
Edit : PC.
---
My hearts beating
---
My heart's beating
---
My hands are shaking
---
But I'm still shooting
---
Still getting headshots
---
It's like 
---
Boom headshot
---
Boom headshot 
---
BOOM HEADHSOOOOOOT!
---
Does it not have a base stat ? I think it might most underarmours do, it's like 5 or something really low, I'm not sure tho tbh cause I use shielded Bos and haven't even looked at the tactical one I bought.
---
Responder Vendors
---
Ive been playing since close to the game release i couldnt afford the beta and was still broke at launch but started soon after after loving 3 4 and vegas 
---
Anyway today my 13yo boy bought his own copy im so excited for him but had to warn him that i think its mainly adults and old boys like me that play so be careful of the language 
---
Then i realised no most people are cool in fact ive only met a couple of idiots my whole many hours playing 
---
Fakebook comments really make no odds the game is amazing and so too are the people that play it 
---
Also youes guys on here are so commited ive never had this fourm before untill i kept getting stuck in the game and im genuinely suprisedabout how cool this place is
---
Imagine survival - but without effect boosts. This is that.
---
And he's me renaming my guns to "*Sniper Rifle*", "*Lever Action Rifle*", "*Combat Shotgun*"... Novelty names like that trigger me some kind of OCD anxiety.
---
Lol shroud playing this game. Funny how every fucking news outlet and twitch streamer/youtuber was shitting all over this game less then a month ago. I hate these normie bandwagoners
---
I have been launching them near them just to watch them run around.
---
I imagine it’ll be full again soon. The reason why a lot of people were playing it non-stop was because it was a limited time event. Now that it’s around to stay I can do both without going “but NW will be gone soon.”
---
I see a lot of supportive comments now on FB, but the amount of toxic Obsidian fanboys is just obscene.
---
Honestly, it'll be somewhat refreshing for "companions" to have more free will. I never really understood why someone like Nick Valentine was willing to just leave his business behind to travel the wastes with you, even after you deal with the Institute. Obviously there's gonna be good and bad with the change, things we miss, but I like the idea of someone telling me they have other business and they'll meet me there.
---
to keep players playing
---
Only wear under armor and you will see the armor.
---
Yup thats me,traveled to a dude that was having a shop and his house didn't fully load so I got stick inside his house while both his dors where locked.
---
I lockpicked myself out(skill needed was 0) and i had a 10caps bounty on me so the lvl 146 dude comes and kills me haha.
---
To add onto this it would also be nice to queue between the game modes from other game modes. Instead of having to go from adventure to the main menu then to NW.
---
Probably because it's not a complete list. It was getting down voted at first.
---
I come to this thread, hanging my head in shame.  
---
Yes, i was a naysayer.  I hate battle royale games.  I'm just not good at them.  And being forced onto a team? Uh uh, nope.  I said if Battle Royale came, I wouldn't try it.  
---
But then it was released while I was on vacation, and I saw all the weirdly positive posts, even outside of r/fo76.  I figured what's to lose?  
---
I like it in small doses.  I don't play more than a few matches at a time, and I'm definitely not that good... but I like it.  I can't wait for a full release and random map regions.  Heck I'm even thinking of rolling a new character to level exclusively via NW rewards (finally do a Drunken Shotgun build).
---
If it's not available in NW and it's unmodifiable in adventure then I'm never gonna wear it
---
Aren't you that raider that talks about enjoying being mean to other people and defends people doing cruel things in the game?
---
Well with no content to play, what's the point of Adventure mode?  More grinding of stuff RNG with the SBQ or Mole Miner? \*yawn\*
---
I noticed that when you drink from it the message "you've recovered from..." doesn't always pop up, but it does cure diseases. Looks like a school water fountain and I think the description is "sulfur drinking fountain" when you hover over it.
---
Most likely your internet or connection issues
---
Wake up scaver.  We have another settlement to raid.
---
Yeah and especially when Wastelanders comes out it’ll go back to normal
---
No he isn't there's no way Im going to use this at all....no sir...not me...never
---
&lt;[https://www.falloutbuilds.com/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/)
---
If they wouldn't let you take them with you from your bedroom in 76 I guess they really want to keep them.
---
nope. never. me either. can't. won't.
---
The reason any adventure modes were empty was because both A) NW was a hit. B) many might have been bored of the grind and C) NW was originally a week long event coming back who knows when in summer. So people wanted to play it while it was around.
---
Also remember part of nuclear winter is going to be the vaults opening and raids.
---
Boom! You lookin' for this?!
---
I prefer using controllers even on PC and when I do I don't expect to be competitive in PvP. I prefer it because I'm a couch gamer plus I like full analogue movement.
---
However, if you're sitting with your kB and mouse anyway I don't understand why you wouldn't use it all the time?
---
Yeah after we die a reenter queue button or watch.
---
Ive been away all week this is happening 
---
I left my house after just getting the jetpack for the x01 pa i think i boosted like twice then had to go to bed to head on holidays
---
I for one cant wait to get stuck into adventure having not yet played NW
---
Hell yeah thank u brother
---
And you actually get single-player XP for playing! I've leveled up my character so much faster this way.
---
That is a solid idea
---
Fatmans are pretty worthless, but now with the last patch there are damage numbers that you can use to calculate what you asked
---
They better test it for TP jumps first JS
---
I don’t think it’s your aim, I really hope in due time that they add a “dead zone option” and possibly a “zoom sensitivity” option. All in all the new reload cancel animation helps along with the sprinting to cancel animations helps to.
---
Nope, no base stats and no lining upgrades. It gives you the option to do it, but no upgrades exist. They should link the lining upgrades to the vault suit or something to give it some sense of utility
---
1. No you don't.
---
2. Every fallout game has had glitches, this isn't a valid reason to rule out one game.
---
3.  No it it isn't.
---
4. I'm assuming this is a joke, but if not, there have been updates almost weekly.
---
5. Never tried survival and have no intention to so I can't speak for this, but they got PvP right with Nuclear winter and will most likely adjust other modes.
---
True, and it allows you to take your time getting there instead of having a companion breathing over your shoulder about how *you should really head to [whatever location] in order to start/complete [urgent companion quest]. 
---
It would be cool to have a game where your (human) companions go about their business as the game progresses with/without you getting involved. Make them *travel with* as opposed to just *follow* you around. Give them a bit more interaction with the world that goes beyond where you drag them or command them to go/do. 
---
Maybe a bit ambitious for *this* specific game, but perhaps down the line we'll see that. :&gt;
---
Oh okay! Thank you
---
I suck so hard at BRs and got a victory in my second game. Killed three people.
---
You could find one on vendor for Assaultron Blade, since you need to use that blade for another badge challenge
---
Joking aside, now you know it is beings used you really have to use it until it is fixed to balance the odds. I have had a few wtf? moments in nw when I thought I wad pretty safe..thistles may explain it.
---
Its badass, sooooo much cobalt and other flux by the train station. Not a lot of bad guys but the farming is sweet.
---
Man I’ve been having so much fun with it! [I made sure to save one of my funniest moments and share it so you can get a laugh to!](https://youtu.be/Rt3892OoIfc)
---
Mate this comment provides no help at all
---
Wow. Does this happen a lot with these old songs? I can only wonder what else can be taken out of context. Lesley Gore woouldn't be a bad addition at this point.
---
I love the faction idea.  I've contributed to quite a few threads discussing it. 
---
They need to let people join a faction of their choosing after the main quest is completed.  Each faction could have ranks with quests and challenges.  I really like how Bethesda did the Ever Upwards questline.  I could choose challenges and after completing I got a merit badge. Then I got to choose a reward (not rng) for completing the quest.   This would be pretty easy to implement imo.  You just need a quest giver and a base for each of the factions.
---
Each faction like you stated could have benefits for being a member.  Maybe after so many challenges you can unlock special uniforms or outfits that show off your rank in the faction.  I would love to be able to acquire Responder decorations, plans, outfits, and possibly weapons as rewards.  They could have the same little vending machines the tadpoles and possums use. Lets say I give 5 commendation medals and I can earn a special Responder themed item skin.
---
PVP events could show up on the map where the Responders need to protect a settler camp from the Raider faction.  Or maybe the Enclave is tasked with stealing tech data from a BOS outpost.  Raiders have to infiltrate the Enclave bunker and steal  power armor schematics. BOS needs to eliminate multiple super mutant threats in the Savage Divide.  Honestly the options would be limitless.  
---
As far as camps and towns go I would love to be able to build in and around Flatwoods or Morgantown Airport.  If they have small "lots" people could use for building it would be great!  I love finding little abandoned houses that I can use for my camp.  We need more locations like this in the game.  I would be willing to have less budget if I could get a camper or trailer house that just needs decoration and a few defenses put up!  It would be awesome to have little communities of like minded people that I could easily group up with every time I log in.  Heck I don't even need a persistent server.  Just put me in a server that my spot is not taken.  Then I can play with other "Responders" who have ranked up in our Faction.
---
Just my 2 caps
---
Is it me, or are there aready NPC's circling flatwoods? Reasons for me saying this, is because I sat and watched a group of what I thought where players, looping around flatwoods doing the same routine over and over again. I honestly watched this over the last 2 evenings for approximately an hour. I tried to interact with them and no response, I up the anti by leaving a good amount of supplies to see if anyone would bite and they kept doing the same routine over and over again. I sent team requests and nothing. And there names were not what I would expect from an average person playing the game.  I swear I am not losing my mind here. I have been playing from the beginning, 1300 hrs in level 300, I feel I live in this game, I  know when something is not normal. Lol.  If I am right than Bethesda is being sneaky. Lol. Nonetheless I look forward to the game getting some more interaction. I  wish everyone the best, I hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
If a player is giving the gift emote, look on the ground for a paper bag (they're giving you things)
---
Imagine If the lockpick and hacker cards were just stackable even.
---
They cant make it impenetrable. It has to have negatives
---
Hahaha ive just realised why i was wanted 3 times at the start of this game 
---
STEALING from stupid supply crates 
---
Maybe im a super slow learner 😀😀
---
You can literally use the new damage numbers to figure it all out yourself...
---
Someone hurry! Quick! Call the wambulance!
---
Ha! I rescind my previous comment. I think I'm gonna go make a "Robin Hood" build and give out free stuff to all the n00bs!
---
same problem here, the shit mission is bugged. can't finish it.
---
Yeah, it's understandable they want to slow down the grind through NW but it just sucks that if you're looking for actual cosmetic rewards half the rewards are either perk cards for NW which aren't even set in stone so you can get duplicates, or things like photo frames or player icons...both of which to me serve no purpose. With how the levels slow down later on it's gonna feel REALLY shitty getting cosmetic items during the later levels unless the XP curve has already capped out in the mid 10s.
---
"Worth" is a subjective thing.  Only you can tell if it's worth it to you.
---
Upvoted for the sick dance to shotgun combo. And Destiny reference. Mainly the reference.
---
As it is right now though it has basically no pros. Instead of taking 4 bullets to die now it’s 5 but you are just so huge and slow it doesn’t make it remotely worth it
---
Yeah, read the post mate 😵😵 I'm asking if I've done the numbers correct
---
Camp placement can be huge for vending.  I used to be just south of Camp Adams in the forest on the western side of the map.  When everyone was trying to get the possum badges my camp saw a ton of traffic.  The last two weeks it dropped off until I moved to the mire just north of Camp Venture on the East.  As Im one of the better stocked and higher leveled players on a server right now, low 100s which makes me think most vets are playing NW, I have been getting a ton of traffic again.
---
That is a problem but at it's best? I'd enjoy hearing something new coming from the radio sponsored by another player in the session, we could have music clubs.
---
There are plenty of aim training games, you can search that term on steam if you want. If you play any specific games (like CS:GO) there are usually plenty of aim training servers/maps too. You shouldn't feel bad about yourself watching shroud, he used to play competitively for years. If anybody can consistently out-aim him, chances are they are already making a living off of it :)
---
You have to make it to the workshop beach to contest the workshop. It will send the other player a notification that their workshop is being contested. However if they do not show up the after the count down is over their turrets will then be friendly to you and hostile to them. 
---
I never even thought about workshop turrets being lumped in with the camp invulnerability. That is a sweet work around for survival.
---
1) Yes. Absolutely yes.
---
2) It's gotten worse during free trial week though. If this is due to a patch or because of all the users, we don't know.
---
Get the road leathers Raider under armor. You won't look like a greaser, but more like Mad Max. Close enough?
---
Wait, sorry maybe you're not that guy just have a similar tag.
---
Love these "my so and so didnt dupe but..." threads.  Feels like you're "asking for a friend"
---
Only thing better is the "I cant log in the one time I tried, did I get banned?" posts.  If you weren't duping or doing SOMETHING wrong you wouldn't be asking.  Innocent people dont immediately think they are being punished.
---
I never have too many issues, I would say this week theres a lot more people playing than usual or that they planned for
---
Pretty much. This sub is funny that way.
---
I think he is referring to the ability to turn on the visual damage display like I nuclear winter. I unfortunately don't have an exact answer for you but have noted explosive weapons damage to be a bit wonky.
---
Nooobody carrrreesss.......nobooody caaaares...
---
I'm glad he is, they're the reason that stupid bandwagon is finally disappearing. I watched his stream for like 10 mins and it was his sub-only chat trying to convince him that the game is shit while he was saying he was enjoying himself. Things like that are helping overturn the blind hatred towards the game
---
I love the br game mode best br in my opinion
---
Yea I’ve played it. It’s great.
---
Thanks. What is the purpose for limiting it to under armor? Not sure it makes sense, from a lore or gameplay perspective. Am I missing some kind of balance or server issue?
---
While I’m not a huge fan of the mode (it has its moments) I have to applaud Bethesda on just how much they communicate with us.
---
They truly had a shit show on their hands back when the game launched; I adored it bugs and all but it got so much hate.
---
Lesser studios would just bail or put in minimum effort and go radio silent; read BioWare with Anthem.
---
But Bethesda has truly pulled this game back from the brink and is shaping it into something truly special.
---
I’m so proud to have been part of this experience from the very start seeing each and every change and improvement as it goes, and I don’t regret being a Day One backer one iota
---
Almost. Although, in this case it would be "Are you there, L33tkiLLa_DaVe1997?"
---
😔 I’m around 100
---
This is exactly it. The world is far from empty, it's just that there are so many low level players that it's spreading out the vets. The last few days I've been one of, if not the only, high level vendor on most maps.
---
Some of the free trial folks will drop off when they can't play anymore, and those that stay will level up and "become useful" for late game content soon enough. In 2-3 weeks it'll be back to normal with a much more even mix of player levels.
---
Hell yes. When I heard rumours of it being BR I was like “that’s stupid, how the hell do you translate fallout into battle royale? Makes no sense”.
---
When I played I was very shocked by how well they were able to keep the original fallout feel while making a BR. Great job by BGS
---
Mark my words right now. Nuclear Winter/Battle Royale will become the primary game mode and get the majority of Bethesda's focus once Wastelanders is over.
---
Adventure Mode is done.
---
I’ve seen the sub turn around pretty quickly once they got their hands on the BR part of NW. which I’m fine with. Most people aren’t open to trying new things right off the bad. Still they came around or gave it a shot and went “eh, someone might enjoy it.” 
---
There will always be the cry babies who say stuff like no one asked for this. That’s just life.
---
I was actually referring to the bandwagon that people are jumping on right now because they added a battle royal, NOW all these twitch streamers wanna give the game a try. Like I said normies all of em. But sure whatever you said too
---
In my experience the servers are either not noticeable (good)  or very unstable (bad).  It seems to be worse since the recent update.  My guess it that it might be all the new players.
---
I really want Bethesda to implement an option to rejoin last server.  It is often requested on this sub so hopefully we get that option soon.  I belive even if you get dc'd you can still go to the workshop you claimed and all the stuff you built will still be there.  You still have to pay caps to "re-take" it though.  Usually it's pretty cheap though.  Until then you can rejoin the server if your friend is on it or if you know the name of other players on it.  I usually take a picture of the recent player tab if I am doing a nuke silo or any other labor intensive activity.
---
lmao no, nobody got banned for duping unless they had a hundred thousand nuka grapes or something. the only "false" bans went to the people who went out of their way to steal everything people were duping, but half the time they kept it anyway, so it's not even really false
---
glitches and stability issues are a fair assessment, all I can say is that they're improving steadily. 
---
So the new content that's pulling in so many players and singlehandedly overturned the public opinion of the game doesn't count as content? And all the other questlines that were added also don't count, right? The new outfits and weapons just aren't a thing?
---
I go a month without any issues and then a few days getting kicked a few times.  It doesnt happen often to me.  Only takes a minute or so to log back in and get back to where I was so it's no big deal for me.
---
I'm close to level 100 and had no idea they buy bulk, I just thought it was just unscrapped junk. I usually hit max caps with the tactical helmets but rubber's annoying to gather a lot of. Thanks for the tip, I should really get into the habit of bulking more.
---
This is pretty easy to do. I think the mod is pretty cheap too.
---
Related PSA: No matter what level you are picking a lock on a camp or another player's supply drop will make you wanted and make you vulnerable to incoming PvP damage.
---
 IF you are under level 5 I'm not even sure if you can do outgoing damage even if you're being attacked for your bounty. My kid collected his first bounty yesterday at level 6 because some level 3 guy got curious about a generator room door in somebody's camp. The guy was firing at him but doing no damage (so was my kid initially because I forgot to tell him to turn pacifist off).
---
I didn’t realize this when I first started, but the different regions of the map are intended to correlate with your level. [Here is a nifty map to help guide you.](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/) I made the mistake of going East too soon, and by the time I found the map, I was too high of a level to enjoy the Toxic Valley or Ash Heap. Other than that, I would say check out as many buildings you can, which will initiate a never ending list of quests to help keep you going.
---
Shroud has always liked Fallout
---
Vendors always sell them now. They only like... 3k? 
---
Honestly, I find the Combat rifle to be better for any build utilizing Vats. Handmade is only better in terms of raw damage. You get more shots off in vats with a combat rifle. More shots means more guaranteed head shots with concentrated fire, more critical hits, better accuracy, etc.
---
I've launched probably a dozen nukes in the last 4 days, but all of them have been on Whitesprings, Harper's Ferry, or Morgantown. There's no way I'm wasting a nuke (not to mention ammo and time) dropping on the queen when most servers have less than 5 people over level 50.
---
PSA: for the ammo factory, you can lock the terminal, so trolls like me cant switch the ammo type ;)
---
Warhammer bro
---
Sounds about right, I had a hunter's explosive reload speed .50 cal for 1000 and it sold to the first high level player that visited after I listed it. Probably could have sold for more, but it's a fair price
---
You can easily buy them at the watoga vendor or harpers ferry and maybe the vendor bots in white spring for those factions
---
I send a request and it doesnt appear on their screen. When it times out i get kicked to main menu
---
There is also a account weight limit, I was using mules and maxing out the space with 1star leggos, by the time I got the 4th half full I couldn't pick any thing up on any character
---
Sick idea my dude. At least that way we'd get some fun factor from wood armor.
---
And on the topic, how the hell can someone that can literally craft the most futuristic advanced weapon armor system from garbage they find in an apocalyptic wasteland NOT figure out how to slap a few splinters together with some adhesive and wire?
---
I mean Jesus! I'm not asking for wood armor plans by any means, but for the sake of stupid, why is there not a way to craft this?
---
Imagine the mods for it: Hard Sentinel Wood Limbs.
---
I'd rock some hard sentinel wood for the lols.
---
Well you can move just as fast and do jumps and everything. only negative to wearing PA is getting a bit bulky but in return, get better dr and are totally immune to fall damage. I think it's fair balance
---
Playing since BETA last year and still enjoying the game and i have to agree that a little text chat won't hurt. Even a proximity one or something. Before you downvote me and send me away i must say that i am from Europe and people here speak different languages and not all of them know English. For example, i have some german and russian friends and those guys only know a few words and being able to type something would help.
---
Another argument is that not every player feels comfortable speaking into a mic. I know you won't believe it but trust me, they're there. There are also players that don't actually own a microphone or can't use one because they would wake their children/ family/ whatever. There are lots of reasons why a little text chat would help.
---
So is it staying permanently? Or just an extended period?
---
That’s what’s funny. So many posts saying “we don’t want Nuclear Winter to be battle Royale!!” Now it’s all “don’t take it away, we love it!!”.
---
Some of us are more open than others and the most vocal seem to be the ones afraid of change. You are right, such is life.
---
Ah, not considered that. Generally I hang around there anyway as it's a Scorchbeast, super mutant magnet.
---
There could be a new mode for that. Survival is exactly what it should be. Base FO76 sans restrictions. Yeah you get some greifers but mostly islts people farming and trying not to get killed. 
---
Sometimes we even work together to kill assholes. Sometimes assholes bust up your event. And it sounds frustrating but the tension as you haul 200lbs of steel out of Uranium Fever is intense. At any moment all your hard work would be gone if someone finds you.
---
Shits fun and I'm not even that good.
---
Real central US time. Oklahoma to be exact.
---
I couldn't give two shits if he played it or not. The servers were alive before he played it, and they'll be alive after he plays it. I don't even watch twitch streamers, that shit is lame. I'd rather play the game then watch some dork play it.
---
Me: I want more songs on the radio! 
---
Also Me: That means I'll get to hear Country Roads less...
---
My kid started in this game this week and hasn't had anything like that happen yet in about a dozen sessions, so it's probably not common. Just logging out and back in to get on a new server should resolve it. You can also block that player so it's less likely you would get on a server with them and if you do they can't see where you are on the map.
---
Highly doubt it. This isn’t fortnite where all their story mode had was fighting zombies and building stuff. There is still large groups of people that only play for the fallout lore and adventure side of things. Sadly there wasn’t much of any endgame content for people do to besides fight the queen and farm. And we’ve all done too much of that. 
---
Just wait till they open the vaults this summer. People will be back to raid them just as hard as they are playing NW.
---
I have zero good sledgehammers lmao
---
Curious, why the 15 charisma stat? I get the agility and some of the endurance, but wouldn't luck be more effective with that build?
---
It was a holiday item. You have to wait.
---
yes.  standard BGS garbage.
---
It's non consequential. Not even worth fixing
---
Fun fact, it *used* to be 5 fuel per craft without super duper
---
&gt; Why? Everyone’s starting to try Fallout 76 again and they love it!
---
The blind following the blind. The game is still buggy, plagued with some of the same issues since launch, little communication from Bethesda, etc.
---
This subreddit just loves to act like nothing is wrong and shun anyone who brings up the issues that are still present in this game, some since launch.
---
Well, since you said that you have very high Strength, max Charisma and decent Intelligence, that's what I would use:
---
1. Pharma Farma
---
2. Team medic
---
3. Field Surgeon
---
4. Ironclad
---
5. Master Heavy Gunner/Master Commando (Really depends what your favourite type of weapon is, but you can never go wrong with Heavy Weapons or Automatic Rifles. There are obviously damage perks for more pistol, shotgun and non automatic weapons too, but these are pretty situational and imo get outclassed by Heavy Weapons and Automatic Rifles
---
6. Demolition Expert/Spiritual Healer/Strong Back (Demolition Expert is one of my favourite perks in NW since it allows you completely destroy enemies with explosives, even the normal Grenade Launcher (Not the one that you can get by hacking terminals) can 2 shot most enemies with it. If you don't like it, you could also use another perk, like Spirtual Healer to heal yourself automatically when you revive a teammate or Strong Back to carry more stuff)
---
The last one just depends on you, but I would use either:
---
*  Tank Killer
---
If you use Rifles, this would allow you to achieve maximum damage output with them.
---
or
---
* Bullet Killer
---
If you want to mainly use Heavy Weapons, you should pick this one, so you get some more ER and DR while shooting 'em. This doesn't allow you to achieve the maximum damage output with them though, you'll need Stabilized for that, but the perk itself requires 9 Intelligence and you have to be in a Power Armor to actually activate its effect.
---
I hope that helps haha, obviously I have no idea if that's the best set of perks, but that's what I think would work really well. Good luck getting most of 'em though :)
---
Also, I wrote this pretty quickly, so I'm sorry if there are any mistakes.
---
Ain’t no company out there gonna pay you 20 cents a level. 🤦‍♂️
---
The current is the increased amount.  It was like half of that.  And when you hit the mid 40s pick up Super Duper.
---
No. Survival is amazing just as it is. Everything you do is intensified by the fear of getting killed. You never know who's around. You never know if your gonna get to keep the 80lbs of lead you found.
---
I understand people don't like to get killed. I didn't but I've gotten used to it. 
---
Survival should just be FO76 without any restrictions. It's just needed. I want the chaos. I want the insanity. I don't care if ten people have old laser rifles or whatever one shots. I ignore them.
---
I'm no expert but I think the damage % modifiers are additive not multiplicative.  Honestly now that we can see the damage numbers just go try it out.  Shoot it once with no perks and not in sneak.  Then load everything up and shoot it again.  Sorry if that isn't helpful.
---
But on a more helpful note your math looks like it might be right? Lol
---
I would hope when the full release comes out they would have that in mind. I've seen them already state that they purposely remove apparel to show armor in games of nw to gauge opponents. I figure once it's "ready" they would have those systems sorted out.
---
This shouldn't be downvoted. It's the truth. It's a shame.
---
They're like 1500 for me wit full unyielding
---
Have you really tried? There are some tricks
---
Thanks, I’ll turn in this one and try again when I’ve saved up enough. Sadly it is the second time in a row she’s given me a Gatling weapon. The one before it was a Ghoul’s slayer.
---
Pretty sure Hawking would come with a power armor suit with Tesla mods and a huge boost to int. He would be super useful for pressing buttons though!
---
I don’t think Bethesda wants to even think about those canvas bags again after their all delivered this week.
---
Makes me want to hold onto his dog armor helmet I found
---
Your case was not me as I'm lvl 262 and I killed wanted players with 5 caps bounty so far. I don't know how much bounty you get for picking a locked door as I never done it myself.
---
They changed the rules with several patches so becoming wanted is now more difficult. Basically you can't destroy camps and kill people with slap damage anymore, thus raiders are no longer inclined much to become wanted themselves. What's left is having a friend, a second account or a new player pick a lock on something that you own and get 76 kills that way for the challenge.
---
Thank you Bethesda for keep enhancing the wasteland experience! I bought several items in the Atoms store just to show my appreciation👍 I have never used pickaxe but I bought the skins and found an Instigating version to go with it, the laughing shark skin is hilarious! Never thought I could have so much fun with a pickaxe👍👍👍
---
Nobody is jumping on the bandwagon lmao, this game has its own dedicated community and that’s it. BR is trendy and people wanted to try it
---
I tried it out on a Deathclaw and wasn’t really impressed. So back to the Purveyor it goes.
---
It brings a level of skill back to an rpg centric game. I personally love the lack of vats related skills too.
---
Have you used it? You move slower and your so drains almost instantly
---
There is another mode?
---
But seriously, I'm enjoying it too much.
---
I just bought it @ lvl 15 for 1702 caps. Watoga station.
---
No. Sometimes it’ll Pepsi if you let it stay unused too long.
---
Using another Bethesda game for comparison, when people brought their companions to ESO dungeons the frame rate was like 10.
---
Look at the Wastlanders trailer. Bows are coming.
---
What I mean is that the mascot head doesn't show up in the Atomic Shop at all, even if you do have it like I do, so you are unable to equip it in Nuclear Winter because of that
---
Find an encryptid event, you should almost always get an electrified buzz blade plan
---
It's phenomenal. I get to play with so many different guns and builds than I normally would. They could definitely add more variety, but overall it's really fun.
---
Own as many workshops as you can and just farm the events. Additionally this will get you purified water to sell and other chems. Go do medtech research and sell all the assult rifles.
---
I'm ok with BRs, but I never really play them for long. This one is the fucking shit though.
---
Some outfits are just worn over top of everything.  The under armor suits can be upgraded and offer bonuses.  If you buy the grognak costume it just covers everything you are wearing. It's really just a cosmetic thing.
---
I would enjoy it a lot more If it didn't take a lifetime of loading before the game starts. I feel like half my time is spent waiting which is really annoying if you get killed semi quickly. So for players starting out it's really frustrating.
---
That sucks
---
I think you're being optimistic. This subreddit is going crazy over battle royale, every other post here is just salivating over battle royale and these are just the hardcore fans. There's no doubt the casual fans love Battle Royale even more. Bethesda can already smell the money and that's why they're keeping NW around instead of getting rid of it. 
---
It's only a matter of time until Adventure Mode becomes, no pun intended, a wasteland.
---
Because I'm in my forties now and I'm starting to get a little stiffness and joint pain in my hands and wrists and the controller is far more comfortable (not to mention intuitive) to me than having to sit with hover hands over the WASD keys. Fallout 4 let me play with the controller but I could easily let go with my left hand for a sec to pop off a couple of high accuracy shots with my mouse and go back to the controller. I see no reason why 76 can't do the same.
---
I think this was the only song that they have ever had a problem with.
---
Your math is... Astonishing. You need to understand paper damage and base damage. Base is the damage a weapon deals before any perks. Paper damage is what you see in your pip boy, that has no barring on the critical hit portion of your damage. Critical hits add an extra hit based on a weapons' Base damage. 
---
What is the Base unmodified damage of a Fatman? 450? A critical hit would look like Paper damage + 450(1.0). Any critical hit bonuses add to that 1.0.  +50% critical would turn that into 1.5 times the base of 450. 
---
The wiki page for fallout 4 explains it better.
---
I’m having a blast as well after being told this game was garbage, I’m glad that they have still been working on it and had the free play week. I’m just a little bummed about how it runs on my Xbox but maybe that’s because it’s an OG? I get a LOT of stutter at times.
---
The only two reasons to use Power Armor in NW is if you have no armor at all, or if you have the Stabilized perk equipped. Other than that, just give 'em your teammates if they want it or ignore 'em.
---
Collect and scrap everything. Do events. Take over workshops.
---
Pro tip! You can pre make a camp in adventure and throw it down in NW. Good for late game fire fights.
---
Are you trying to team up for NW? 
---
If so, you have to do it from the main menu. It's not like the other modes where you can do it in-game.
---
It’s also useful if someone drops a nuke but other than that it’s kind of useless
---
Also can be pretty critical early on.
---
The furious 10mm pistol you got was a pretty good find tbh. You probably should have kept that one.  I know you said you use rifles but you could have made several thousand caps by selling it to another player or using it for trade on something that fits your style better.  Oh well. Just keep at it, you will find something good!
---
Even the ability to look around a corner and see where you're getting sniped from is a bad idea. I hadn't realized this could be exploited and I would say remove it entirely. I don't have time to take pictures, cool as it may be, during a battle royal.
---
Yes. Nothing to do on adventure mode for me either but is sad to see it so empty.
---
The only thing i think off is that more creatures (such as a scorched/ghoul horde) added randomly somewhere in the match that wanders to toward the circle..
---
(Or a pre-determined location)
---
Tried all 3 modes, from the main menu, in game and from playstation homepage
---
Didn’t know there were people still there lol
---
Ok that's fair enough. Controllers are definitely more comfortable and cause less strain.
---
IMO matching up other PC controller users with each other would be a preferable solution. Seems more fair.
---
me too, melee sucks... OP LOL
---
Haha ok,i never played a game as much as this one,addictive as hell
---
Is it possible the sniper cleaned up your downed players?
---
Yeah, that's true, but how often do you see a nuke launch that is also not completely wasted?
---
I just tried your method you talk utter shit.
---
Making it down to the last 2 or 3 teams only gets you under 100 xp WITHOUT killing anyone.
---
So let's return to my comment as true and yours, as I suspected, false.
---
You have to kill quite a few people to get decent Adventure XP out of a game of NW.
---
Also allowing them some leeway in case there was some serious technical issues surfaced during the initial week to pull it.
---
Have you considered that by helping new players with resources and weapons, you actually rob them the initial experience, thrill and struggle of getting started with the game?
---
Yes, that’s the only one I regret not keeping. Just got impatient to get enough scrip to try again. It was the 2nd 2* I got and I didn’t realize how much worse the RNG would be for me. I don’t seem to have the good luck some people do harvesting Legendaries (e.g. yesterday I was running through WS on a good run of collecting Legendaries and BOOM, server disconnect and I lost all of them).
---
They are icons, and stash skins. Not lootboxes.
---
Ah righto, and then would it add the perk bonuses?
---
This is how I play as well; Elder Coat is ironically good camo for the high brown grass, and most people won’t find you if you’re patient. Bonus points if you have Frog Legs or find a Chameleon serum.
---
I agree. I logged in a few times in the last few days , just for a second....and the amount of people and vendor camps is way down
---
Well on my 3rd one it actually sorta worked. I was able to completely rebuild my previous camp....separated into like 15 different blueprint sections like a freaking puzzle. 
---
Camp relocation is sooooooo bad.
---
Thats not a bethesda game or the same engine.
---
Fuckin degens' from up country
---
If you don't like it that much, then don't use it. I don't see you complaining over pipe revolvers that suck just as hard
---
Nuclear Winter has shown me something I never thought possible: that this damn game engine could genuinely provide a rewarding experience. It feels like a proper FPS. The animations, the timing, the responsiveness are almost all on point. It's not perfect, but it plays completely differently than the single player experience.
---
Combat feels fun, dangerous, and risky. PVE is literally just me standing in one place or slowly moving forward/backwards. Here, I have to think, have to weigh risks, and have to be far more responsive.
---
I legit never thought the engine could handle it, but I've been proven wrong.
---
Yeah im gonna do this.
---
While there is that possibility, OP is right. It doesn't matter if you down every person in a team, if another player kills the last one and the others are all still in a downed state, the person that killed the last player in that team gets credit for all of the kills.
---
Legitimate criticism, and an issue that needs to be addressed.
---
Honestly in the beta I wondered how gun-fu would even be possible in live vats. Then I realized vats didn't leave the enemy after killing it... 
---
Then I stopped using vats and switched to melee because the hanging onto dead mobs was super annoying.
---
every videogame sub is like that
---
tbh that's also true for Adventure and Survival modes. Other than nuke zones or if you really like Heavy Guns(Stabilized), I see 0 reason to use Power Armor.
---
No I can confirm that the downed players were behind me and the last player I was chasing was in the woods running into a clear towards where the sniper was. He would not have been able to see the downed players at all. I thought of that too. Honestly I’m not sure if you can steal downed players kills, say if someone from another team downed another player and you kill that downed player I still think the player who does the downing gets the credit. Can’t confirm this second thought yet but I can guarantee that this sniper did not see or hit any of the other downed players
---
Bah really? I was hoping it’d be something to open on adventure mode. Thanks
---
Whenever someone on reddit tries to say something in programming is simple i can hear the groans of every game developer on earth.
---
Glad y'all are getting your bags, but they are honestly still far outshone by the bags given to influencers.
---
Can anyone tell me what VATS is? I've been playing for about a week now but still got no clue what VATS is
---
We need Big Iron in Fallout 76
---
I've had this issue before playing with my old lady. We play in the same room so I know the request never goes through. 
---
Tbh I'm not sure how we fixed it. I want to say one or both of us restarted the game completely.
---
It increasingly sounds like the only reason we didn't have NPCs / dynamic quest lines at launch is because they hadn't figured out the instancing tech. I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they've talked about how it took them a while to figure that out. If this is true, my guess is that the quality and sophistication of NPCs / associated quests will improve in line with their instancing tech.
---
Totally agree, just wish that all the cool stuff and buildings weren’t locations
---
Vendors yes, people no. Tons of brand new players in the lvl 1-15 range.
---
It depends on what you are grinding for I guess?  Are you trying to get to end game?  As far as the atom shop goes nothing they sell inside is needed to play the game.
---
A big part of this game for me is player interaction and exploring.  You don't have to grind for that.  I do enjoy the legendary item/purveyor/player vending loop as well.  That can be grindy I suppose but I like trying to keep improving my character and items.  Fallout 76 is at its best when you are playing with other people.  Whether its pvp or questing with your team.
---
At the end of the day Fallout 76 is either a game you will like or it just isn't your style.
---
BUT MY IMMERSIONNNNNNN.
---
Bunch of babies.
---
Also one of the treasure maps take you there..
---
In general, I feel like NW launched in a good place, but I feel like the .50 cal and the auto 40mm are a bit too strong in NW, and garbage melee weapons spawn too frequently.
---
The first question is what strategy do you want for your vending?
---
I set up camp along a path frequently traveled by relatively new players. I try to price things very cheaply, purified water for free, etc. The only thing I make any real money on is ammo because of volume (I sell it all for 1 coin each). It’s partly because I want to help newer players and also because I don’t really want to spend my time figuring out what to charge for things. I made some effort for awhile to sell more valuable items (weapons, armor, etc) for about the going rate but they didn’t sell very quickly and I got annoyed they were taking up weight in my stash.
---
That is soooooo tedious though. You're asking me to go into my menu and potentially glitch out and get disconnected for some freaking water.
---
No, I haven't. But, then again, I'm not a dick. So, I don't have to rationalize my actions to myself.
---
And you can have mine
---
Ya, I would like to see Bethesda loosen up the restrictions on locations we can build.  There are so many abandoned houses and buildings.  I imagine is so we as players don't interrupt missions and locations with structures.  However there is tons of empty land in Appalachia that they could give us for settlements.
---
Yeah! I've gifted newbies at least 15 Brotherhood recon rifles these past few days
---
You should have it from the very beginning, its called bicycle light, you have to attach wires to it and cycle the colors manually or randomize them via terminal.
---
No it isn't. What are you taking about? Anyone that has a camp has a good supply of pure water. Most peeps with camps also don't lock their purifiers, which is good.
---
Boiled water is the hardest part of most recipes.
---
Ok well in a way it makes sense why the sniper got the credit for your downs...
---
The last player was killed. That player was the only one who would revive the other 3. I say would because everyone could revive them but why would they...anyway...the sniper killed their only hope of being revived. 
---
That's the only logical reason I can see
---
A purified to boiled recipe would be the simplest solution.
---
What section do I find it in?
---
Ya, stability has been sucky all week.  It took like 15 minutes for my camp to load in yesterday.  It has to be all the new players clogging things up.
---
I'm pretty glad with how it turned out. 
---
It's a PVP mode I actually want to take part in. It's been a ton of fun so far, and team mates have been pretty squad oriented which has been surprising.
---
Now w just need a few QOL additions, like pinging loot locations, enemies, and gear.
---
I think you'll see it balance out.
---
It's just the new thing, and it was well done so everyone is hopping into it.
---
I wonder if we will be able to have 2 companions at the same time? And both of them will be able to visit us in our settlement?
---
I don't know if its the servers or the actual game, but something is fucky with the perfomance.
---
regerts
---
Singular they and y'all are perfectly acceptable. 
---
Or "you all" if you want to tone down the WV.
---
You mean the imposter Sheep?  He's a tough bastard for sure.  You have to have a team for that final fight.  Even the regular sheepsquatch is pretty tough if you don't have good weapons and armor.
---
From my experience the atom shop hasn't been easy to acquire. But again, this is my experience, and if people on this subreddit can't possibly take the idea that someone else had a difference experience than them and downvote then you guys are the definition of fanboys. I quite enjoy the game, have been playing for quite a bit, but my main complaint is with that atom shop.
---
For a "pre-beta" gamemode, it's really stable.
---
Congrats!  Good kill and don't worry about the tactics used.  At that level you had no other choice.
---
The very top one under lights, its not the white but the yellow bulb.
---
Lost of server disconnects the past two weeks (PS4)
---
So level up
---
Is it weird I had no clue about this, and got it without knowing how. I got it completely accidental.
---
Y'know, I legit never thought about swearing in the Fallout universe, but given it's an alternate timeline, I wonder what unique and interesting slang they had?
---
I saw someone nuke Flatwoods this morning and get 5 kills with it, was pretty crazy
---
I don’t have it
---
How do you tag items to search for?
---
Automatic targeting system. There should be a button on your controller/keyboard which activates it in the presence of enemies/npc’s and mines.
---
If you have a nifty legendary item you could sell it quick in the trade sub.  Making 2300 caps in game will probably take you about 2 days unless like I said you have a valuable item.
---
They say that... but it's mostly because in some countries it's a serious crime to hack console games but not PC games. So they can sell in those countries if they say it doesn't work on consoles.
---
Agreed, it feels a little off, for the mode. Needs more switching on the fly, instead of looking for a place to hide around and go thrifting menus and such.
---
I'm assuming the reason they dont want companions following you in the game world is it'd be weird seeing multiple of the same companion, that was kinda weird in swtor
---
Is it me or is Adventure mode getting thrown under the bus? Lol.
---
Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System
---
It's a game mechanic that lets you target different body parts. You have to press L1 on Playstation to initiate it.
---
Yes. Story mode is done. 
---
No one is going to bother playing the new main quest line or any of the smaller DLC updates coming along.....
---
BR will likely always be popular, but it's not like there's not a bunch of exciting content coming to adventure mode to keep folks interested.
---
you can only have 7 perc equiped at a time. they do not stack like they do in adventure, not sure if that is your issue or not. other wise sorry you lost the card.
---
Yep, it's a rando looter shooter grindathon.
---
Maybe that isn't what you want, but it doesn't make it a bad game.
---
I think you're being pessimistic. 
---
There's a significant chunk of content coming to adventure mode.... 
---
Which always brings people in swarms.
---
My issue too. Takes too long to start. I get they want us to explore, but we can only really explore every 10 levels or so...
---
Thanks for the tip on collision course.
---
Have a grrrreat day.
---
Nukes are amazing lategame. Just leave a little sliver in one of the last circles and it pushes people right to you
---
My hero
---
What does ‘published by Bethesda’ mean, then?
---
I still like adventure mode a lot more.  I think right now NW is new and more challenging to players who have burned through most of the PVE content.  Once Bethesda releases more content for adventure mode people will be back.   With all that being said NW is still a ton of fun to play!
---
GiT gUd. No shit. That's what I'm trying to do. But don't make a quest available so early on and have the boss lvl 70 that's a one time fight.
---
There’s a big difference between what a pipe revolver should do vs futuristic tank armor...
---
Then you add the damage displayed in your pip boy, the Paper damage. So the 3000 or so damage you are claiming + the estimated 450 x 1.5 damage from the legendary effect.
---
I believe it is R3 on PS4. It should tell you when in the crafting menu for whatever system you are on.
---
This game does have a lot of bugs but I’m not talking about those. If people enjoy the game mode enough to not care about bugs that says something
---
Same! I've been lucky the last couple of times and chose weird random areas. I also got lucky enough to find a box with a gun before I was killed.
---
Also random side note- I feel like there should be a way to separate levels, like how in any way is a level ten up against a level 1 anyfair?
---
Yeah but mine had 0 accuracy and I have all the mods for it but it would only go up to 5.
---
Yeah the imposter one. I didn't have a team and died almost instantly twice. Now the event isn't there and the quest is done.
---
I mean I still think Bethesda needs to be held accountable for all the shady shit they did upon release and months after, but I agree those FB comments are toxic.
---
You're being downvoted because everyone is experiencing the same exact game as you, yet your "experience" seems to amount to nothing more than being upset that you're not being handed free content. Nothing, I repeat, nothing in the atom shop is necessary for gameplay and only enhances multiplayer vanity at best. Sure repair kits might be useful but with how many weapons are thrown at you for free during general gameplay, you honestly don't need to spend the pennies for a repair kit for a weapon that you may be attached to.
---
This and the "we were unpaid beta testers" comments are the most obnoxious comments in this sub.
---
How did you expect them to quality test new game modes for an online service? Pay a couple hundred random people ?
---
Sure, let's have them do that. I'm sure you will be happy paying for DLC to have that happen.
---
Don't give out your password.
---
You need anti-virus on your computer.
---
They could even keep some of the meta ones but just make them require ammo not effects. Like explosive could be changed to an ammo varient that is expensive to make, I'd just like to be able to PVP without getting one shot and not being able to use my stealth build.
---
U have to get the matrix overdrive mod for your power x-01 armor. Then when wearing press block and fling your joystick in all directions to dodge bullets and lasers no problem.
---
Agreed. The flame is so so much fun to use and just not viable because of the ammo consumption.
---
Oh ok, I looked for it and didn't see it straight away. I'll look a little closer tonight.
---
Gotta say, you have a lot of good points. 
---
However, it’s a stretch to call Bethesda humble for fixing bugs in its releases. It has always been crucial for them to do so due to the staggering number of game destroying glitches that are always in their games. 
---
Not a point of hate, or just is what it is.
---
Oh wow the accuracy is zero... Weird.
---
I have the strength perk were guns weigh 75% less and grab guns from stash box and throw them in bushes but I'd never feel the need to discconect after dying with a mingun or tesla rifle
---
There are perks that make you essentially dodge them. Evasive in agility is one of them.
---
It stays in your inventory during the match; so you can load/listen to it while sneaking around
---
You will get better.  I play pubg. I can win easily every other match. But I lost nearly 50-100 before winning haha
---
Play fallout 1 and 2 :)
---
The problem with using either boiled or purified is that it means we'd have two of every recipe that uses water. What I think would work better is either an electric pump for dirty water that we can then boil ourselves, or a pump with a boiler on it that generates boiled water on its own. 
---
Alternately, they could swap the big water pumps to also spit out dirty water and make purified water somewhat rare, but that may be something better off in survival.
---
Best thing this showed is that a smaller area on these servers can support twice the player volume. Now they need to up adventure modes server cap.
---
They are spendy but now they are at the vendor. 1700 caps I think I've seen them for.
---
While I would agree, I have to admit that I have never launched a nuke in NW yet. I just can't find these damn briefcases. I can win multiple times with 13+ kills, but if I'll die before I find one a nuclear briefcase. (That doesn't drop from a player, atleast.)
---
Yes I thinks that’s how it works but it shouldn’t in my opinion. Losing out on precious xp that I would like to have
---
I played each game about ten times, but I can't remember any particular swearing off the top of my head. Granted, it's also been... what, almost 20 years at this point, so maybe I just forgot.
---
The thing I remember most was everything exploding like blood sausages.
---
I, however, have been very, much suffering without VATS.
---
You HAVE to complete the challenges and do the exams. You can cheat on the exams since all the answers are online though. The backpack gives you such an advantage I feel as though it's worth the time.
---
Nah, eating in tonight
---
I've wanted this one forever as well. Nothing fits some really comical situations we encounter in game.
---
There is a perk card in Charisma that allows you to get better prices from vendors. It helps.
---
You need to earn three Tadpole badges, and complete the rest of the quest. There's not any easy or fast way to do it. Another player cannot give you one.
---
We got it off a scorchbeast! They’re a pain in the ass and sometimes give away your position, but that drop was worth it in the end.
---
Good, just don't this isn't the core game mode in the game.
---
I have it on lvl 3
---
I tried nuclear winter twice last night and (as a melee main) just left like a burden to my team trying to use guns (reaction time isn't what it used to be).
---
So, back to roaming around the adventure mode servers for me :)
---
Have to complete 3 of them. Some are easier than others, esp. solo. I didn’t have a camera on one, so I did I think Hunter, Athelete and ... forget. On another I happen to have Pharmacist, so did the one that requires it and I forget the others but also mostly solo.
---
This strangely enough sounds like the most realistic companion system in any fallout, imagine guys, a person who doesn't want to be your pack mule and won't put up with your shit unless it's really important for the community that they'll only join you in certain instances mission.
---
I like this.
---
Please oh please make this happen within the year
---
I made 500 in ten minutes
---
If you're using VATS, then its a no-brainer decision to use Calibrated or Tweaked automatic.
---
You sacrifice a tiny amount of base damage, for the hidden base damage multiplier Critical Receivers apply on any type of Critical. Calibrated has the highest hidden base damage multiplier on Critical.
---

---
The classic white springs is a good place.  West tek as well
---
Always a good choice
---
Right.
---
That is literally what the survival mmo genre is.
---
All its shown me is how much more negative the YouTube community is when a bad game tries to improve itself.
---
I agree though, this is fun.
---
I’ve made pretty decent money selling ammo. It’s only 1c each but it often sells in quantity.
---
Yay!!
---
How
---
You can but another key card and fight him again.  They cost like 2K caps though.  
---
The lead up to that fight is deceiving though for sure.  When the content first dropped high level players were getting smoked.  Just keep your eyes peeled for the quest and rejoin it.  It shows up on your screen like the nuke drops so you will be notified.
---
Used a mod in Fallout 4 that changed pre-war vending machines into functioning ones that only took pre-war money and I can confirm that it is amazing content and would only add to the game.
---
By the fans, or by Bethesda? We know Wastelanders is coming, so I'd certainly say that Bethesda isn't throwing Adventure mode under the bus. And as far as the fans go, I've seen a lot of comments around from people who aren't playing this, so I'd say no. It's just that it's only the first week of the new mode, so a lot of people are playing it (and liking it)... and I'm sure many are just working on getting to Level 100 to get the Hellfire PA.
---
Set up a vending machine in a place frequented by others players and sell as much ammo as you can. Craft more if needed. Shotgun, 10mm, 5mm, 5.56 etc sell well.
---
Make it so you buy the cavas bag in the arom shop but it unlocks a slightly different bag to the one shown
---
I don't particularly care about cosmetics in games, never have :)
---
The repair kits are primarily my main issue, but it's also the premise that when you say that 'everything is acquirable with some gameplay', when in reality (from my experience, maybe I'm just 'bad at the game') it's taken MUCH longer than what should be expected to get those. I've always never had issues with handing out some money for good content, but the prices for these items are absurd. I mean, don't like it don't buy it, I get it, but it's still pretty absurd that they even offer it for those prices.
---
It's not quite 'outrage' or the upsetness that is attributed to most critiques of this game. It just seems a bit absurd. Between this and the single main questline being offered it seems just a little weak. Then again, I appreciate the post-launch support.
---
Also, downvoting my comment, real classy man :) You sure showed me!
---
I’ve tried rejoining but the workshop will get reset with all my stuff gone and not refunded. If I try to claim it back, I have to dish out the resources again, which is a big deal for a fresh level 30. It was bearable the past few days, but today it’s disconnected central for me. 
---
Either way, I’m gonna hold off until after the free week is over and see if the issue remains the same. Thanks for the answer!
---
If the last standing player on a team is downed while all of there teammates are down, they'll all die instantly and the player who downed the standing player gets credit for all the kills.
---
It's stupid and should be addressed, along with downing someone but not getting credit for the kill when a teammate finishes them off.
---
Yeah, the event is a one chance. You can buy the recall card thingy of vendors though if you want to do it again, but it costs like 2k caps. It is a endgame sort of event, so I do not recommend soloing it, minimum a team of 4, preferably don't do it unless there is a lot of high level people on your server.
---
It goes so fast ... so so fast ...
---
B'oh
---
There are definitely fuckier than they were pre-patch 10.
---
Not just in terms of the 'server not responding' lark but also other telltale signs of 'rot' like enemies T-Posing and A-Posing, doing the moonwalk, manifesting from thin air etc.
---
However my CAMP now spawns faster, go figure.
---
Either way this has been an unusual week with NW and the F2P 'thing'.
---
All in all most sessions I can still play continuously for 4-5 hours before things get 'screwy' so hey, we've seen much much worse ;)
---
Maybe this is by design and the servers are trying to tell me something.
---
Something along the lines of 'go out, have some fresh air, meet with your friends...' :P
---
Ohhhh
---
Should be down at the bottom of the screen when in the crafting or repair menu.
---
I don't agree. Under that shitty logic, most quality of life improvements would never make it into a game. Please, never develop a game.
---
You and a lot of other people it seems. I was on a server earlier and I was the highest level player at 153. That is rare for me lol. The only vendors formed a ring around 76, and everywhere else was dead. I can't remember the last time white springs was so empty.
---
I find guns, store them, and bulk up items and then sell them
---
I love the BR mode. Only thing that I want improved is having to go back in to BR mode through the main menu, and the wait time. 
---
Otherwise, great job!
---
Whenever you see an enemy or tell people where something they can loot you could “ping it” so a little marker shows up on your screen, think like the floating quest markers
---
That's screwed , I hope they fix it soon :/
---
Bethesda was smart to let people immediately try it out and judge for themselves, rather than have them wait a while to play it while everyone is expecting it to be shit
---
Yeeees! Awesome!
---
It's just a random drop, sometimes they're behind terminal locked doors and other times they're just sitting outside
---
To be honest, the "pre-beta" was a safety net for large bugs. Which I haven't really heard many of. Though I did get stuck in a church directly behind the pulpit under a shelf. It was a smart move on their part.
---
If you get NukaShine from another player, drink it to get a nice melee buff that's kinda OP. I'd drink it asap lol
---
Yeah, during regular gameplay it’s but a minor inconvenience but when I spend resources to get the stuff going in the workshop only to lose it without any profit it gets tiring. Thanks for replying though!
---
They have specific spawn points, but may not always be there. Kind of like how magazines and bobbleheads are set around the world also.
---
Archer,athlete, and swimmer badges are the easiest.
---
Thanks, I appreciate it
---
Good to see this game mode allows for a pacifist playstyle.
---
No it stays online
---
Ugh that’s too bad. Might wanna wait for things to get more leveled in this case I guess. Thanks.
---
They said yes. So it looks like it will.
---
It isn't, no. It's a reward for reaching Overseer Level 100 in Nuclear Winter mode. Once you earn it, it will unlock in the Atomic Shop as owned.
---
That's weird. I have been disconnected and been able to rejoin my team on the same server with all my stuff still at the workshops.  All I had to do was spend the caps to retake the workshop.  I play on Xbox so I'm not sure if that matters.
---
But honestly, good advice!
---
Do the main questlines for levels.
---
Don't rush; immerse yourself in the lore.
---
You can RESPEC youe Special points after 50, but 1 point at a time instead of new perk cards.
---
 Buy a few power armor paints...sorry bud
---
Morgan town airport was where I used. Work your way through, and do the easy event there and server hop and repeat.
---
This so much
---
Contact customer support for the platform you bought them on? 
---
I think that’s probably about it.
---
I see both sides. Its happened to me. Luckily, my teammates get the kill at least. I try to finish them off when I can but in the heat of the moment you know that downed player isnt going anywhere (unlike other BR games). And not moving when downed is a whole other topic.
---
But yea, the sniper shouldn't have gotten a full kill. Maybe some kind of assist.
---
Email them.
---
Try to contact Bethesda support or won't but I don't think there is anything
---
Download more RAM. It makes it harder for hackers to get passwords.
---
It’s the A button and you don’t need to hold it especially don’t do this in a nuke zone in power armor
---
Same. I never got tired of Codsworth calling me "Mister Boobies."
---
Agree
---
That ronin helmet is sick
---
Ya that works. The only problem is that robot vendors share a cap pool and it's maxed at like 1500 per day.
---
I just got an email there.
---
Damn did you lost your enter key along with your family member? Sheesh
---
Expect a lot more of this “actually...” news to break before this DLC drops. There’s a reason they didn’t show us too much at E3. I’ll be pleasantly supposed if this DLC is worth anything at all.
---
Isn’t that the quest with the drugged stuff? Or am I thinking of something different. I think I heard my friend talking about that
---
Battle Royale / Nuclear Winter ;-)
---
Events, claim workshops. On this play through I decided I’d go at normal speed, not just FT everywhere and on the way, I’d claim every workshop as I passed by. I’m over 50 and I’m just now on the way to the Whitespring.

On rare occasions a set will be at the top of the lighthouse.

yeee..cheating is bad on pc tho...

I've not enjoyed any of the BR games I've tried. Apex was the closest I got to having fun, but I just can't do that fast fire, twitch action. Did not feel useful at all. This though, I feel like I can make an impact. Only played it a few times but it's the only BR game I've played that I honestly had fun with and didn't really care that I got taken out.
---
The lore is super interesting, thanks :)
---
Awwww yeeeeeeeah baby!
---
Got it, ty for the tip!
---
Go get 1400 from the vendors today by just picking up everything and selling it all. Weapons are the best just kill a shitload of mutant's, scorched, or mole miners then pick up all weapons, aid, etc and sell to nearest vendor. Just pick up stuff til your carry weight is hundreds of punds over then sell it all that's 1400 right there. Next bet is to check all caps stashes by going online and finding where they are then just go from one to the next
---
They are keeping it live.

---
By building them too much I mean the turrets, fusion generator or two, the necessary stuff. In the early levels some recourses are hard to come by. By no means am I building a settlement there :). Thank you!
---
There is always a high lvl player near the area so all the ghouls are lvl 68
---
Where I agree its more fun as a form of PvP its important to note that it would ruin the normal game if they took away pvp vats, simply because pvp isnt for everyone and vats is a sort of equalizer. I started playing this game as a way to play a game with my dad that he enjoys, but hes old and honestly terrible if you took away vats I could kill him on a level 1 account and hes max level. thats not fair or fun
---
Its def a high lv event. Need 3 people ATLEAST. The squatch is invis/ immune until all three pylons are activated. Activating a pylon creates an electric charge that slowly dmgs players till death, or the squatch dies.
---
Platform? Yes it matters
---
Yeah i think i like having something to try for.....and at least NW unlocks skins and stuff. Id still play the Arktos pharma quest in adventure mode, but noone ever seems to want to, or they cant coordinate enough to complete the event
---
I'll have to test it by killing something but I know that when I first got the notification I was trying out NW for the first time. Then afterwards I went into AM and I saw I had the level in the perk screen without having to gain xp in it first. If there's a glitch occurring for later levels where I have to kill something to secure the level up then I'll let you know.
---
And if you are queued up with a friend and they die, you don’t feel obligated to die too because they get no do for watching and waiting for you for 15 minutes
---
Man how good would a full set of armor look for those helmets?
---
Ok thanks but which event may i ask?
---
Oh I’m playing solo, so that’s probably why.
---
Please don't throw Adventure mode under the bus. Let's equalize all aspects of the game. It seems like this may be the direction you are going. I have put alot of time into this game, been through thick and thin and would be devastated if you where to support one aspect because of popularity. I  may be way off key. But I  really don't dig the whole let's kill each other and repeat. It is kind of childish. I enjoy the honest effort of survival in Adventure mode. I thought are job was to rebuild Appalachia. This is comming from a player 1000 hrs in level 300. Just don't forget about who did not give up on your game in a  time of adversity. I have been punished enough. I wish everyone the best. Kindest Regards.
---
It’s still in the stash. It’s alcoholic so it will also show up in your fermenter inventory
---
Incorrect. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4f9q90xXpnRJ8vlIWVJxVK/fallout-76-nuclear-winter-is-coming
---
I hope you did your duty paladin.
---
Not for game owning players.
---
If you're f2p...then buh-bye
---
Having a hellfire skin and mentioning X-02 doesn’t work lore wise. I think this mode is just for some extra cool stuff to show off in a multiplayer game.
---
Yeah you’ll pass out and wake up in a random place on the map. Be careful.
---
So does the fermenter count as stash? 
---
Cause when I look in the actual stash it’s not there. And I keep thinking I drank it or lost it until I remember this 😂
---
Pretty sure it is a bug they didnt mean to include.
---
What level do you recommend I should be? Doesn't basically all progression just stoo at level 50 anyways?
---
I cleared my sector appropriately
---
It's not realistic to expect any game to be worth 380 bucks, when you put it on a pedestal like that you are only setting yourself up for disappointment.
---
Assist xp would be much appreciated even if it’s 5xp per an assist would be good enough, hopefully they can get that figured out by the next patch
---
Heh heh, stupid robots. They can't even drink! We need a bribe with oil or alcohol option for that.
---
Deathclaws are big cuddly teddy bears in 76. Just run up and hug ‘em
---
West Tek at Lv 25? Expect to die a lot... Get a power armor, stock up on stimpaks and radaway, then run whitesprings
---
Alcohol for dehydration too, though that makes little to no science sense.
---
Ok good idea
---
How do you know when you get down or upvoted?i know u can “see” it but u get a conformation or something?
---
I tried but got mauled to death
---
Wow, community here is so nice
---
I've noticed 2 that really bug me
---
My character will randomly shoot, seems to happen when I start to sprint
---
My base is very basic and put together normally and there are many parts I can't place because they are " floating" even though they are not and are snapping to where they should go
---
Honestly I’m kinda torn. On one hand I hate micro transactions, on the other I hate grinding.
---
I like the mode, I’m just shit at it.
---
Im level 36 and ive had 1 missile launcher, seen 2 with 21 wins. How are you finding so many?
---
The levels vary. There’s times where I find ghouls lvls 22 or so. What I would usually do it hop up on cars or buildings
---
Yup. When you clicked play it just loaded you into a new random server.  Like I said earlier go click on the social tab and check the recent player section. I use my phone and take a picture of all those players on the server.  Then if you get dc'd you can find those players, at least you can on Xbox, and just join the game they are in.  I use that trick all the time if I'm doing a nuke silo or trying to run workshops. Anyhow, good luck.
---
Choose a class of weapon if going ballistic - big guns, shotguns and pistols have a weight reduction perk available while rifles don't. I've ended up primarily melee, using an LMG or machine gun for the damage output at a distance with my build, but YMMV.
---
Melee is the only thing that dents the health bar of higher level enemies sometimes in my experience, but it really helps to use life saving armor when getting up close and personal with targets.
---
You've gained karma
---
While their at it please make jumping us AP. Saw a player wreck a game because he was just jumping during the fights. Good playing by him but why isn’t AP drain associated with jumping like in the other modes.
---
Ash heap
---
Yea, they've already mentioned before that they're constantly pushing the limit for stability with camps. I personally would love more budget, but not at the cost of running at 2 fps for constant stuttering. Giant camps would serve no purpose as much as I'd like them to. You're better off having a dedicated area that acts like a trading hub or something, and whenever a plot is available, your building gets placed. People don't want to understand that there are limitations with this game's performance and stability, and even if we could support large camps, that's a loooooong way down the road (like 2 years of upgrades, fixes, stability improvements, optimization, etc...).
---
I wouldn't mind a hard limit for decorative items. The limit would of course be high, but there would be a limit, meaning they could allocate more budget overall for those individual items, like how we can only build 50 lights, but the cost for them was dropped significantly. I'd prefer that limit to be around 200 to 300. Even for the most decorated camps, that limit is pretty up there, but certainly not unreachable. With a hard limit, we'd have greater build budget. Why they haven't done this already is honestly strange. Perhaps it's something they'll implement with display cases and the ability to decorate them with stash items (display cases include magazine racks, legit display cases, weapon racks, and quite likely shelves from the images they've shown).
---
Hell, just put hard limits on everything. 100 walls, 100 foundations, 100 roofs, etc. I wonder how far they could get with stability and budget with hard limits that are quite reasonable.
---
Ok ill try it
---
I’m actually a little disappointed that for leveling up you don’t get hard to gather junk.
---
Like say maybe every five levels you got a set amount of certain stuff.
---
Just a skin to make other PA look like that.
---
I'll have to try that! Where's the best place to download?
---
Ad Victorium brother, that is an answer deserving of the Brotherhood.
---
No one joins my squads anyways so I think it's just a dead event for me :/ Thank you for the info :)
---
They published the game, not developed it. 
---
&gt; Usually, the core difference between video game developers and publishers is that developers are responsible for creating the video game while publishers are responsible for marketing, sales, and PR of it. Most creative talent in a game comes from the developers. They get the idea for a game and have a team of artists, programmers and designers create the details of how the game will look and feel.

 You're missing the items, try pressing the button and see if it lets you repair, if not,  go hunt for the items. That's what I did. Lol
---
I can accept that  cosmetics are atom shop only but I need something other than a vault jumpsuit for underarmor.. everything else unequips as soon as you grab an in-game armor
---
That would make sense as to why my health was draining for no reason. I activated all three and then died instantly.
---
60 carry weight def worth it
---
Adding these to the list. As far as I know the Stimpak Diffuser is only found as an reward form the Arkos Pharma event...  
---
It is interesting the corn worked that way for you. Nothing I had in my camp (Benches, etc,) registered until I scraped them and built a new one.
---
This BR has the same problem for me like every other one. its just a waiting simulator. Im not good, so I die pretty fast, but the loading time takes ages. So i spent more time loading than actualy playing the game. Zero fun and getting killed just makes me angry, because i know i have to wait again. I just want to jump straight in the action again.

I'm not sure we'd need two of every recipe. Just make "water" a component of both boiled and purified water, in the same way that crystal is a component of microscopes, cameras, and magnifying glasses. You don't need specific junk to craft items, so perhaps you wouldn't need specific water to cook recipes, unless the game mechanic is completely different under the hood.

Ummm...that's why it's a boss hence the term "boss level"

&gt; With all the excitement and popularity, we wanted to let you know that the pre-beta sneak peek of Nuclear Winter will remain on and continue to receive updates, so keep sharing your feedback. There’s more to come! Thank you again for playing, sharing, and being the best community there is.
---
Hellfire was made at the Adams Air Force Base during the time of fallout 3. It’s pretty well mentioned just like how X-02 was developed AFTER the fall of the oil rig.
---
The Hellfire is a skin not a full suit. As for the X-02 we’ve not seen anything about that other than a terminal entry at this point.
---
Yep, it’s just a stash that filters everything but alcohol
---
Same. I'm still low level, but the .50 machine gun for range and Gutter or Grognak's Axe up close are the most useful at this point. Life saving armor certainly helps.
---
I see now, somehow didn’t get that earlier. I’m gonna give that a try then. Thanks for the tip.
---
Ok ty
---
It's this kind of banter that makes me love the community more.
---
The base backpack increases your carry weight by 60 at max level which is nothing to laugh at. That isn't all though you can mod it to give it different effects. Like increased carry weight to 120 or make it give you 90+ damage resistance. The backpack takes up it's on slot so it doesn't conflict with any armor you have on.
---
Or run towards the sentry bots and gutsys and let them take em down just get your shot to ghouls at least once in the process to get xp
---
Bing, got it.. It's asking for my credit card details. That should be fine shouldn't it?
---
Most of these people have never tried the game, don't mind them
---
You can respec your special points and you continue to get new perk cards every level.  This is how you can fine tune your build.  
---
Im level 185 and there is no way I can complete that event by myself.  You just need multiple people to hold the pylons and be able to deal good damage.  Legendary gear and weapons are a must once you reach endgame.
---
Oh okay cool. Thanks man!
---
Yes. The backpack is its own piece of clothing and is always visable unless in power armor where its removed. For non PA users the bag is a must.
---
Scorchbeasts will let you ride them too.    Actually, that’d be pretty cool
---
**Lockpicking Government Supply Drops I requested shows "Now you are hostile towards the owner."** occasionally; no Wanted status gained. As far as I can tell, this can happen when there are non-player witnesses nearby, such as More Rats for example. *Not new.*
---
**Design consideration**: Picking the lock on Government Supply Drops someone else ordered gives Wanted status, even to level 2-4 people just exiting Vault 76 for the first time. I think the steal indicator text is not generally apparent and perhaps there should be a message dialog the very first time one tries to open a supply drop or a locked item/container in a workshop or camp.
---
They’ll disappear on their own
---
They'll despawn in a while.
---
I had a guy speed hacking/teleporting (Couldnt tell which one) in one game, he wasn't even good, got him to 1 health a couple of times but he'd just superrun behind a tree and heal
---
I’ll take lead and steel depends how much :)
---
Sucks to be you.  Quit crying like was the end of the world.  That's just funny shit
---
Honestly though? As a high level player myself, do you really need SBQ farming at this point?
---
I nuke that area just for the violet flux. There is nothing the queen drops you can't just buy. I typically nuke areas just for stable Flux farming mats.
---
Honestly if it had been worth 60 bucks I would have been happy with it. It wasn't. I paid the extra for a happy wife not 380 dollars worth of game. And i really did want to like it. But yes the disappointment was definitely there. The hollow miserable disappointment.
---
Gamertag is Totalledjeff22, hop on now and we can work something out bud
---
I misread the comment, as a Yes to OP's question. My bad.
---
I like that people now visit each other. I think action houses and hubs are convenient but they also take away from the wasteland feeling, I fear.
---
Now, a faction-run city with rental houses/plots however. That would be a very attractive place for people to live - and for powerful enemies to raid. Which could be epic...
---
Use them as pillows.
---
It's very useful. The quest to get it is such a grind, but worth it.
---
I believe Bethesda has said they’ll be fixing this in the near future, with your loot being dropped if you disconnect
---
It’s based on the points you have in there from adventure/survival. You can rank up from NW but I assume you have to go into adventure and put the points where you want them to rank them up
---
And it still spawns in the world at only 5-8 fuel.
---
Start the quest for excavator armor armor if you haven't already. Read the poster outside of the Rusty Pick in Ash Heap to start it.
---
I don't disagree with you but I don't think Bethesda wants everyone maxing out fast. There's not a whole lot of cards to unlock.
---
Which one is that?  I don't remember it.  Usually a server jump will do the trick but if not maybe you can go do some other stuff for awhile and see if that helps.
---
That sounds like a pretty good design.
---
I suspect that the current design is far from what they were ultimately planning, thus the pre-beta.
---
give repair kits to all your friends
---
Yeah i feel the same its fun in some regards but im just waiting around than i sneak and theres already a bad balance in NW. I want those rewards but i cant Personally see myself playing this mode that much and with the free players leaving im curious to see how populated it stays.
---
wow rest in peace
---
I thought it said it was upgradeable as a "casual underarmor" in the description. I could be wrong
---
actually, I may have misread the comment lol
---
I only play adventure to make blueprints for NW now.
---
That’s exactly the reason I don’t touch survival mode or pvp outside of NW. Legendaries and vats and even perks to an extent can make it feel unfair and like you’ve been killed unfairly if you yourself don’t grind for the gear with the best stats. In NW everyone has equal opportunity and it’s just skill *and a tad luck* that determines the winner
---
I will try this out. But it’s strange somehow.. wouldn’t it better if I could change it directly in Nuclear Winter Mode? Because based on PvP oder PvE i need other Skills..?
---
That's good news then, thank you.
---
or he traded in his game after launch and is rebuying? or got a refund (which is allowed also)
---
Pretty safe bet it'll be a display case when they eventually introduce display cases (magazine racks, weapon racks, legit display cases, and shelves from the looks of it), and we'll be able to put stuff inside. The last we heard of display cases was a week or 2 after the Purveyor came out, and we haven't had any word since... it just keeps getting delayed. It's better that it works rather than being broken, but holly hell has it been a while. It was first mentioned when player vending was put in the roadmap, then trading was delayed, then it wasn't released with trading, then it wasn't released with the Purveyor, and now its status is just "SOON"tm.
---
Yes, but you need a friend to stand behind.
---
How did that even happen,  the game is on sale for 30 not 40. Sounds like 100 percent your mistake,  I wouldn't expect anything from customer service.
---
Since this is tied to monetizing, what if there was a way to pay atoms to export your character’s clothes to BR?  I know I would love to play as my beerhat-and-straightjacket-and-welding-goggles crazy hill man, myself, and I’d probably pay 250-350 atoms per item to make them available in BR.  Alternatively I would pay ~500 atoms to make the whole thing an “outfit” that I can’t edit further.  
---
This type of interface could be housed in a machine in one of the vaults, and might also create a “clothing economy” in adventure mode for rare clothing items.  
---
I think it would be fun, anyway.
---
so some time after 1030pm in game alright ill see if i can get it to activate more often because i need badges and thank you.
---
Can't you just place your own brahmin pen thingy in your camp? I have one in mine and figured everyone did. I milk it all the time bc it's my brahmin and i do what i want.

---
If you like it, buy it. Only you can decide it's worth.
---
Long run though, all additional content/expansions/dlc etc should all be free with purchase of base game. In my opinion that alone is worth it. Most other games out there charge you an arm and a leg anytime they release new stuff.
---
download Kovaaks and get a steelseries rival 600
---
Nah, it was my bad. Thanks for sharing that link. I not known they plan to keep it online.
---
I don't get what is fun about cheating in a multiplayer game.  If you want to feel omnipotent just play a single player title.  It just seems pointless to me.
---
I chose humble because there is a large amount of players and few who bought the game and threw so much shit at the game and hate towards Bethesda for a game they put out too quickly to try n catch sales from the Holliday’s to what is now an amazing game with a huge community. We live in a free market capitalist society and everyone’s gonna make a buck some how. 
---
Shit when I bought it the day of its actual release I had no idea what it really was. I always just pirated single player games on pc and played them through and then went to the next. I bought a used Xbox 2 years ago and just bought used games most the time just to play casually. I liked fallout games and saw a new one so I gave it a shot. I barely played it until I met one random guy to play with and then it became more fun. I then got my 1st 3 star drop which was a tse Gatling gun when I was level 30 something and couldn’t even use it. Found a hazmat suit and went to a queen with it once I reached a high enough level to use it. Talk about glitchy but when I went in there for the first time with that gun before they nerfed them I was hooked and blown away. I just thought My internet was terrible I didn’t even know anyone playing the game was experiencing the same issues. I later dove into the community of people playing it to find out it was worse in the beta and how it just kept have more and more issues but I still played and lived with it and took the risk I guess of loosing something or dying and not being able to get back into a server. Here I am over 700+ hours play the game pretty much daily have multiple characters a group of people I call friends and talk to them all the time from all different classes ethnicities and backgrounds which in the real world we would have never become friends let alone come in contact with each other. The games fun a lot of fun I would call my self a well “seasoned” gamer and have found one that I’m fond of last game I played this much  was team fortress 2 and counter strike source. 
---
With NW mode I’m stoked it’s a refreshing quick play arcade style almost where it’s a level playing field and enjoy it. Not really a battle royal fan but it is definitely unique and still feels like I’m playing a fallout game. I’m excited to see NPCs again and love all the new content that comes out even tho running around with a camera and making booze is quite silly but I think that’s Bethesda.  
---
Throwing out hate is to easy these days.  be constructive and have ideas instead of just saying it sucks or how shitty of a job they’re doing. 
---
Bethesda reads this crap hopefully
---
How about 2 caps a lead 1 cap a steel
---
Endgame had a chick with a rocket launcher take out our whole team while we were fighting her mates
---
Yeah a big part of it is that I’d have the game for the wastelanders update even if I got bored in like a month
---
Gotcha 👍
---
I have a bug since P9.5 that when I reload my gun, it automatically fires a round without me clicking any mouse buttons. Sometimes if I reload in a gunfight, I fire two bullets instantly, one of which is due to this glitch. It is possible this hold-to-shoot is getting stuck and replays when we reload/sprint.
---
I don't know about camp glitches as I have a flat open camp with crops, workbenches and vending machines, no walls, stairs, roofs or anything like that.
---
Someone just told me it's at the bottom of your crafting/repair menu. On PS4 it's R3, Xbox is probably the same.
---
Sounds good to me, hop on now and we will do it
---
The mode is so much fun so happy they left it in
---
Pretty much what my team did last night. My team won 8 of 9 matches this way.
---
Counter question: Where do I get this quest?
---
Yup doesnt work for me as well
---
What in the goddamm?
---
I heard it too! I thought it was exclusive to new vegas. But I was proven wrong. Haven't heard it since either...
---
If it's the quest early in the game, in that small town near the dude's dead body and the terminal, just go into inventory and play it. That's how I got around the same issue.
---
How do we get mods for it?
---
Well your skill points go across adventure and survival and you can change them the same in either. Maybe in the actual release they will let you rank them up within NW but because it isn’t the main intended game mode I’m not sure. I prefer it how it is but only because my build is pretty set and I wouldn’t change anything on the character I’m using. I can see how it would be easier for a new character though and only playing NW with it
---
So unfortunately, even with max points for any stat, you can only have a total of seven cards equipped.
---
I would focus on getting at least three points in every category initially so you can at least equip the perk cards you get. But the play is still very limited. If you want a heavy weapon build, to fully max out the damage, you'd need 9 points in strength for example in adventure mode. But that also means that you are looking at equipping 3/7 perk cards to just heavy weapons.
---
With life giver, hacking and lock pick (needed to get a good weapon) that's 6/7 total points which is not optimal.
---
I’ve just found it. For some reason it was in the middle of the room. Weird! Thanks anyway man
---
Probably once a chunk of the playbase reaches around 70-80 they’ll update the game and add more levels w/ new skins and camp items.
---
People are allowed to like multiple things and we have to face that right now if you made it to a reasonably high level all you’re really doing is making your own fun or farming gear and plans. There’s not much end game to speak of which besides the buggy launch has always been a bad thing about 76. 
---
People have something new to do. Once new stuff or at least cool repeatable stuff is added into adventure, we’ll see people all over adventure.
---
Read a poster in any train station.
---
How much per plasma core?
---
You probably should have adopted him.
---
I think some spawn right above the white springs service entrance. Just use vats and you can spot em.
---
And?
---
I was one of the people on the fancy, I was open to NW but at the same time said I’d probably play it once and go back to adventure. Now I’ve been playing NW non-stop. (Mostly because we all thought it was only going to be around a week.
---
Now that I know it’s here to stay I can balance my time in adventure and NW.
---
They ain't over. Crappy clickbaity YouTubers will continue to call this game shit and refuse to try it.
---
And they get thousands of views and convince people to do the same
---
Oh dang, OK. I appreciate this.  
---
Is there a wiki for this game that I can refer to? I don't want to post basic questions like this time and time again -- with all the new players, I'm sure the vets are getting a little tired of it.
---
90
---
It’s still on trial. Try it out.
---
I will keep this short. I have **400** hours into it.  If you like other Fallout games or just Bethesda games you will like it.
---
Uh, ok I’ll pass thank you. I bought them recently for like 20c each thanks
---
It was but if I remember right it actually had a date for sometime in April and it never happened.  I could be wrong though.
---
This one feels different. I am not opposed to BRs, but I don't really play them. I played a few rounds of Apex Legends and it was fun. But I am trash at them, probably because I suck at MP FPS in general. I would have been fine with a FO76 BR all along, but I never would have expected to enjoy it this much.
---
This feels so casual. Nothing like an esport. They even included builds and leveling -- non-cosmetic progression. It is also connected to the base game mode, giving you XP and gold and benefiting from increasing your character's SPECIAL in adventure mode.
---
Yeah the duplicates are pretty annoying.. About half of my new perk cards have been duplicates and the other half melee, which as everyone knows is useless in NW
---
I want this... because I want when ever dedicated servers can come out for there to be actual settlements ran by factions &lt;3
---
I’ll agree that it was the smartest move. If they had waited people would have spend so much time imagining how bad it could possibly be without any good.
---
I mean, what else are you gonna do?
---
I think the option to wear "achievement clothes" from completed main quests. I would love to wear my Enclave Officer's uniform with a monocle.
---
Ok willing to go to 75 each but that's the lowest
---
Yup, some people who have the time, will spend 24/7 on it and do everything their is to do pretty quick. Even if that's the case, you could set it down for a bit and play something else and come back every few months for the free new content.
---
Personally I'm level 150+ and have yet to do everything in this game. I still keep finding things i missed, additional side quests and what not. 
---
Now with the addition of nuclear winters battle royale mode, can be a nice break from the main game if i end up a little tired of it.
---
Either Toxic Valley or Ash Heap at that level, maybe start venturing into The Savage Divide. Events and quests are your big xp earners. Farming places like Whitespring is ok but you run the risk of it being full of high level enemies. Definitely start doing the Miner Miracles quest if you haven't already.
---
&gt;literally all it shows is that people have more fun when they have a chance
---
Well, sure. With a full-time job and grownup responsibilities -- and really, just a distaste for e-chores in general -- I don't want to have to grind PvE to have a chance in PvP. That's why I'm excited. I want to spend my gaming time actually doing something ... yanno .. *fun*. Mind-boggling, I know. :)
---
can we assume all the babylon stuff was the BR mode?
---
Just loot everything off them. They despawn quicker that way.
---
I don't build anything and I have fun. 600 hours in and I've never changed my camp and only moved it once. I'm too busy roaming the map doing stuff. Time at my base is very limited so why put time into something I rarely see. I have more fun farming legendaries
---
It'll just get harder and harder to win especially once free players are gone. In particular because you're rewarded for grinding by having an advantage over players not to your level. So that might cause new people to skip out on it.
---
Balanced battles, who's outcome derive from teamates, choices , and your aim. No gamebreaking duped legendaries, very few exploits so far, my stable if toons are starting to miss the  rest of Appalachia. Seriously just doing dailies in the normal game before jumping back in. So stoked they are extending NW, all my toons thank you Beth!
---
They confirmed they will add this in the future .
---
I have a feeling that factions will coincide with the towns. So you can choose a faction and then that faction has it's town that you can build, defend, do tasks to upgrade, whatever.
---
XB1, lvl 73: It was already said, but worth repeating, "Losing loved ones is super tough."  I am near Vault 76 as well, and have turned numerous new players onto your grampa's lake.  I am MrFostr in game.  Look me up if you have the notion.  This is a great community, and FO76 is a community building game as well.  Cheers my friend.
---
Get a refund if it was on xbox. You can refund anything within fourteen days.
---
It makes sense. I mean, why should you get the credit for the kill if you weren’t the one who actually killed them?
---
To be hones, im not sure if the game has enough players to sustain this mode. At the moment, everyone is trying this mode, even I did and also alot of Players that are just testing the game. Im sure some of them will also buy it and maybe keep playing the BR, but I think in a month or two, there will already be a problem with the amount of players playing this mode.
---
Many people who try it now, like me, will never touch it again, simplay because they dont like battleroyal and the people who are looking for this kind of game already have a lot of free options with big playerbases. 
---
It will be hard for bethesda to establish this mode in the long run. Its a well made gamemode, but im not sure if its enough to sustain a healthy playerbase.
---
Maybe they make Nuclear  Winter F2P at some point, without time limit.
---
Sounds good to me hop on now and we will do it
---
Kk gimme a few min doing other trades
---
Go to the Overseers Camp, cross the river to the left of the covered bridge. All sorts of critters spawn there. I just server hopped until there was a rabbit.
---
Yeah but also you can still corner look from just going in third person.
---
Todd i will be back online this winter  iv not forgotten you (FO76) so don't take my seasonal gaming personal
---
This is awesome
---
That matrix overdrive mod is so hard to find! Its not at any of the vendors no matter how much I server hop.
---
Yeah for the Wastelanders patch, that sounds great and i'm all about it, but I mean player factions. I've always wanted a real Fallout RP server, where it's not just the Settlers or Raiders, but my own "Shenandoah Rangers" having an area on a private server.
---
Essentially what Altis Life was for Arma... I want some ability to do some of that in the Fallout universe xD
---
so me and my friend definitely aren't the only ones! the conspiracy of the big iron begins.
---
also new vegas best fallout (at least for now, we'll see what's in store for 76)
---
Yeah waiting isn't fun I completely agree there. But honestly it's one of the faster loading brs. And sometimes I get super pissed. It just happens. In my opinion it's my favorite BR to date.
---
You have to complete badges and then the mods are in the pioneer account vending machines
---
It means I don’t need help anymore, stop trying to be smart and just read...
---
Im interested to hear why you dont like it.
---
&gt; It WON'T be a battle Royale
---
how do those words taste?
---
Can't believe you're being down voted.  I'm a new player and have experienced almost everything you listed.  
---
Other players run in place.  Possibly they have disconnected.
---
Enemies can sometimes move bakwards
---
Occasionally I'll see an enemy health bar and type at the top of my screen, but no enemy and it disappears under 1s later.
---
I've seen a possum labeled as mole rat.
---
I am enjoying the game and I think for $30 during the sale it is a decent value, but had I bought on release I'd be livid.
---
Enemy T poses I see constantly.
---
Oh u were talking about workshops my bad
---
By the fucking shit he means like the stuff as in like he likes it
---
I do like it. I enjoy it immensely. I said it was the shit, not shit.
---
Facebook can be rather cancerous at times, I've noticed.
---
Well, hopefully you will see it pop up when some high end squad does it and can join in for rewards at that point. There is a server wide announcement when it starts.
---
? Lol no thanks
---
My bad lol. I missed the, the
---
"**Robot head low damage number.** If I shoot a lvl 46 Assaultron in the head, I get the yellow-orange number of 6, however, shooting them in the chest gives 24 damage with my Troubleshooter's Ultracite Gatling Laser (32 damage). Similarly, shooting lvl 50 Protectrons in the head yields 9 yellow-orange damage and body-shot \~26 damage."
---
Are you just saying the colors are off?  Because the weak spot on a robot is not the head.  The fusion core is the best spot but it's hard to hit.  I hit assaultrons in the legs and protectrons in the arms.  Torso shots on Robots is medium damage.
---
If I totally misread your meaning I apologize.
---
Heavy gun perks and Gatling or 50 cal seems best for me
---
Whatever the hell I can based on what RNG gives me.
---
Alright thanks. Do u know how I can get a working camera?
---
same
---
I agree it's an issue but Bethesda probably doesn't want everyone maxing out too fast. There's really not a whole lot of perk cards.
---
no smoking... drugs and alcohol only...
---
What you need to do is buy a "Keanu Reeves Power Armor" paintjob from the atom shop. Then you can stop the bullets in midair.
---
I’ve got the same issue since the last update, quite annoying.
---
The gave us signs and letter and we can literally write anything we want. Also a new blank billboard to do it on. I'm not saying you won't get in trouble for being offensive, but you can actually do it.
---
So, you want XP but you don't want to play for it?
---
In both Adventure and Survival modes, the camera has an incredibly small 'bubble' that it is limited to for Photomode. The one time I *did* have time to stop and try in Nuclear Winter, I ran into the exact same 'hard bubble' limit.
---
If it *does* go farther than that, I expect it is a bug and will get looked at.
---
I think for the most part it's due to it's glitches at launch. Combine that with the lack of content and identity and it was a recipe for disaster. That being said, if you play the game today you will most like not expierence any of these issues. I would say most of the people that hate on the game a) haven't played it since launch b) never played it to begin with. Give it a chance it's pretty good
---
Yes. Also, if you are crafting and run out you should see a “tag for search” option at the bottom. That will mark items w/ the magnifying glass if you’re looking for them.
---
This is becoming a big thing huh? I still havent run into anyones pre- made camp. But im guessing theyre crazy now??
---
Want to know even a bigger issue? I'm level 44 and I haven't got a perk pack since 37.
---
Last 2 days I played some NW, then when I’m defeated enough and had enough punishment, when I logged to adventure, I was the only one on the left side of the map for a good while. My base is down at whitesprings. Was just me. I decided to nuke whitesprings, and even after the launch grind, there was only 3 total killing the ghouls.
---
This is what you say, when you have no good legendaries. 
---
You can’t just come into this game, play a new mode, and request the games core changes for everyone else.
---
A lot of us have put a lot of time into getting this stuff
---
When you are ready it will present itself to you but only when you are ready
---
 Dont wanna play br ill play tdm or capture the flag but i just dont care for br and wanna get the stuff through other modes
---
Well it's the only post i've found where someone actually tried to gather this information. So, no matter how much upvotes this get, know that you have a special place in my heart.
---
They will need your Social Security Number too.
---
Holy shit, is that right!
---
It's something different, the rooms all have a different biome and the mechanics are different enough to breakup the monotony of running the SBQ and sheepsquatch/imposter.
---
There's also the addition of a level 100 enemy known as an Alpha predator.
---
it's an icon.
---
My friend hit level 6 and he has MUCH better cards.. nerd rage, bloody mess, master shotgunner and I think he said he got rifleman also
---
I’m all for this, at least an emote for photomode or something
---
They extended it!!!!!!
---
I've been doing it since day 1. I have a couple 3-story "floating camps" and I add floors to it like crazy. Only do this in the last couple circles though.
---
I can get high on all kinds of stimulants! Just not one named nicotine. 😂
---
960+ hrs here. Yes, it’s worth it
---
I downloaded it on Xbox one for the free play week, and at first was having fun until I realized once you leave the starting area the FPS and input delay are so bad it’s almost unbearable. Also after playing for a bit I began to notice a lot of bugs and glitches animations. I thought this game had fixed all these issues by now but apparently not.
---
True though to max out people would need to gain 73 levels in a mode that in order to earn the experience for all those levels you have to put in the time to get kills, survive or do what you can for points. It's not necessarily as easy to grind as AM.
---
I thought it would be cooler but eh
---
😂 feel bad bro!
---
it's quite good actually, i'll probably follow that, ideally demo expert and tank killer, i enjoy every weapon but rarely find enough heavy ones, also with this loadout i can max rifle damage :D
---
This. I have a few PA characters I’ve not bothered, but the non PA people use it constantly.
---
You wrote a very nice post. I appreciate your work. 
---
I'm a very big Fallout fanboy. I spent almost 1000 hours in F76. Somehow I feel that this game is still far from good. 
---
You are right about the progress. Bethesda is busy with our beloved game. Sadly, this progress is still not enough. 
---
My only hope is the Wastlanders expansion. However, I'm worried that this new quest line will take only 3 to 5 hours to complete and after that we will receive just another repeatable side quests just like in Fallout 4. I promised myself if in September I'm going to hear that "Another settlement need my help" I'm going to definitely say goodbye to Fallout franchise (and Bethesda).
---
Not only that, but it makes those who want those skins more inclined to just play the game to get challenges and more atoms.
---
Huh? It's not like other players can do anything to you in your world of love and flowers... What are you scared of?
---
Based on my ability to aim I’m going for a Stevie Wonder..
---
How do you find heavy guns in relation to shotguns? I was considering the latter before I respecced into shotguns
---
Thanks for sharing your story! While I haven't had the chance to share any games with my relatives, reading your story reminded me of the ties that span generations.
---
I never knew my grandfather all that well and by the time I was getting to know him, Parkinson's was eating away at him. It wasn't until his funeral that I learned that he was a scale modeler. My dad's cousins told me stories of how they loved going to Uncle Jack's house because he kept whatever cool model he was working on under his couch, along with the accompanying reference books.
---
This hit me like a freight train - I've been building model tanks and airplanes and reading those same reference books since I was a kid! I never got the chance to show him any of my models, but I have an idea he'd be proud, just as I'm sure your grandfather would be proud of the home you made in digital Appalachia.
---
Would you guy like me to collect more photos and post them in a separate post, or just keep adding to the imgur album I already posted?
---
They’ll have to rename it something like MedSmoke or Smoke-X or Stimstogie.
---
Awesome marketing move, kudos for the team!
---
That's what i hoping for as soon as display stuff will be finally introduced.
---
Also i agree with better late than broken.
---
What i'm also could imagine since the bowl was taken down - maybe they try to fix something about the brewing/vendor/display/bowl sorting.
---
Encrypted is an event, the questline finished when you got the fixer. There was a huge amount of confusion over this when that content first launched.
---
I don't know what the actual problem is. The orange damage number indicates crit spot hit on other enemies, such as shooting Super Mutants and Scorched in the head. However, as you said, heads on robots are not crit spots apparently and you do way less damage than a body shot. Thus the coloring could be wrong and/or the limb damage/resistance could be wrong.
---
Nuka-Smoka
---
We already have exp per AI Kills.  I'm sure it would be only for Player DMG.
---
XB1 lvl 73: I'd give you multiple upvotes if I could - one for each of the "Bessies" I have lost.  I have a complete open farm (all available produce in the game), 10 unlocked water purifiers, all workbenches available in the game free for use (not behind lock and key), and reasonably priced items in my vending machine.  Everything is available, so why kill my Brahmin.  My turrets would take out the offender if engagement was enabled.  I will upvote this subject everytime someone brings it up.
---
On a side note, what other cool things do you get past level 20? Last thing I got has the laser rifle skin (I think I haven’t checked what it was actually)
---
Shroud is popular (imo) for his aiming ability, which is top tier so comparing yourself is just a mistake. He’s just good there’s nothing else to it. 
---
Also note, I used to be a huge shroud fan and watched his streams pretty often. He’s human. You should see how many times he’s dropped to get killed by the dumbest reactions, and bad plays. They happen. He’s not perfect. *Some* high profile streamers claim stream sniping or hacking when they get killed, ya know because they’re *too* good to ever get killed. 
---
There are a few training games to play, and even a few competitive games to play to also help. CS:GO being the front runner for that. It’s all aiming and competitive. Great game if you can get into it. I’ll edit with aim training. 
---
I don’t think 720p vs 1080 or 4K really matters. But what does is hz. 60hz(or lower) compared to 144hz is pretty crazy and I didn’t ever think it would matter until I got a 144hz monitor. I definitely felt I had an edge up to the ones who didn’t have one. [Here](https://youtu.be/pUvx81C4bgs) is an example.

Stevie mashing buttons would have more success than I do.

Smoking is bad. Mkay.
---
I’m glad you asked this, because it seems like everyone has an unnecessary amount of masks and I’ve never even seen the event.
---
That sounds like a more rare occurrence that what normally happens! If anything I literally see more players helping others as even described by the CEO and he laughed! 
---
It’s a great community and yes, there are some jerks out in the wasteland however the far greater majority are good peeps!
---
Right???
---
Not sure if I should say.  Don't want more of this crap in the game.
---
Do some searches on how to cheese the game.  Im sure all the toobers have videos telling how.
---
Everyone has it, so it’s not unfair.
---
No way to get the masks are all legacy
---
Glad you do not do this.  Less people doing it the better.
---
Very doubtful, probably raiders and settlers only for Wastelanders.  Maybe somewhere down the road you might something similar to what you propose.
---
I posted my specs. Which partin particular is garbage?
---
Bloodied Combat I would sell for 1k or 1.5k
---
50 cal scrap it
---
10mm - anything with explosive will sell.
---
If you go to settings you see Pacifist and you can turn it on or off. 
---
Turning it off means your shots won’t put you into PvP if you accidentally hit another player. 
---
However if your teammate has theirs off... bad news for you even if yours is on.
---
At a guess i would say farming terminals or safes since they're guaranteed? Would that be it?
---
I'm excited about the influx of new players. So many people are already vets now vending can work for low-level all the way to the high level. Large market. and of course after they level up will have more options for running encrypted in scorchbeast Queen
---
Jep this.
---
No and I don’t plan too.
---
Sorry not really that type of game.  I think the battle Royal is the most fast paced game mode you'll see
---
Unless you’re hurtin for cash, just buy the game. It’s on sale for 30, and now you have atoms to spare on a few nice items in the atom shop
---
Ya it sounds like the damage number indicator is right but the colors are wrong.  For most enemies the head is the weak spot so maybe they forgot to change it for the good ol' robots.
---
They changed White Knight for example, don’t know about other perk cards at the moment.
---
Player vending is the only way I know of. Glad I didn’t sell off all my (then common) masks back when they were a dime a dozen
---
I’m stuck on console and get sick if I play in first person. The FOV is insanely close and the blurred horizon doesn’t help at all. 
---
Love the game, but stuck playing 3rd person.
---
Here's a list -&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0fsuy/list\_of\_nuclear\_winter\_rewards\_with\_images/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0fsuy/list_of_nuclear_winter_rewards_with_images/)

How much should I do for smg?
---
Got any extras? As in 2 or more of the same
---
there are a lot of ghouls always wandering around outside and inside -- but collision course event is decent for xp. :)
---
lol nice random downvotes. this post has been 50% downvoted. for what reason? none. fucking dumbass redditors, lmao. just scrolling down the list downvoting every post.
---
Bloodied combat is pretty good. I think its the only shotgun you can mod to have some kind of AA.
---
What are the other traits on it?
---
Here's what I do and usually get well set up to win and sometimes win:
---
1. Spawn at the Gilman Lumber mill
---
2. Pray to Todd no one else spawns there 
---
3. This place usually has 3-4 big crates.
---
4. You should have marine armor and a good gun
---
5. Loot small crates and creatures as you make your way to the circle. (Or your teammates)
---
6. ????
---
7. VICTORY ROYALE
---
*laughs with quad crossbow*
---
I know where those hotkeys are. But... seriously, like 8 different buttons just to swap between menus and categories? This is not user friendly. It feels like a quicktime event. I have to wrap my brain around in which menu I am every time, which button in which menu to press... its just rubbish, thats what it is. It feels like a cheap console port from the 90s.
---
I think they turned them off after the first one was repeatable and people managed to get tons of perk cards.
---
I haven’t touched Nuclear Winter yet, as I really don’t care for battle royale. Should I give it a try?
---
What was the "lie" exactly?
---
Lead, steel and plasma cores still available
---
I am gonna guess terminals or such. Yeah Ill pass on the rocketlauncher
---
You can still get them from other players.
---
Ah yes - the very best way of keeping your winning strategy secret: posting about it on Reddit.
---
On a more serious note, thanks for the tip!
---
bull barrel image for reward
---
**the bull barrel is not in this fucking game**
---
plz fix thanks
---
1/ I don’t keep my mic open. Team only for me.
---
2/ Several - 
---
Your FO4 impulse to keep and scrap ... you’re going to run out of space. Scrap before you store in your stash, and do your best to fight the hoarding instinct. 
---
Think about what you’d like to do, and look on here for builds and advice for that. You may even find folks help you with gear.
---
Don’t rush to the end game. Enemies spawn based on the level of characters in the region, but some regions are capped. Wandering into he wrong region as a low level can get you face to face with some pretty serious high level threats.

I came back to post another comment. The event was between March 19-26, so it was not only limited, but seasonal, and won’t be back for a while.
---
Right next to Charleston station spwans critters. My camp is there and its always something getting stuck on my porch.
---
30% dmg to animals
---
Probably. What was the username?
---
1. \+33% VATS does nothing for a shotgun because of the range limit, so it's just a good 1-star. 2k to the right buyer, &lt;1k if you want to get rid of it.
---
2. Scrip. Stalker's is garbage, especially for an MG.
---
3. People will buy almost anything with explosive for some reason, although an SMG might be pushing it. Value would depend on the first star.
---
This literally holds this game back so much. Simple settings for these would improve the game 10 fold for me and that is no exaggeration especially with a battle royale mode in place now it simply doesn’t feel good to control the weapons at all. This change would mean so much
---
Cheeseburgers50 or somethting like that
---
The downvotes are mostly from the market-sub-gear people who downplay the impact the gear has and insist it's their build and skill that allows them to be so successful at PvP.  When my workshop gets taken I always go into game chat and politely ask where they got the sweet explosive gun from, I've never gotten a straight answer.  Sometimes they lie and say it isn't an explosive gun but most of the time they curse me out and assure me their advantage comes from their flawless build and my need to "git gud".
---
Interestingly, I've never seen a YouTube video or stream from one of these "superior build and skill" types where they wreck at PvP without legendary gear.
---
You can load into survival and play rumble.
---
Dang I can't believe I missed that, also what was the first one?
---
That’s the wasteland. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Yesss I've used it so much in BR and it's great, I wish it was as good in adventure/survival. Take an upvote
---
The field by Charleston train station
---
Odd, the wise mothman should be invincible
---
This reads like horny prose from the post apocalypse. I'd throw you some caps on Slaytreon.
---
That’s a good one, there are a lot of things that fall into the “animal class”. I would personally sell that for 3k but it would take a little bit for someone who wants it to buy it.
---
I'm pretty sure mothman is invincible in that event, so.....
---
So it’s staying for good or has the beta been extended?
---
He's lying on the ground dead after the other guy shot him. Lemme see if I can fast travel back and get a photo.
---
I have my camp East of Top of the World. I've noticed at least a dozen+ low levels fast traveling to my camp, looking around, and then traveling out east into Harper's Ferry. I love being a fast travel point!
---
Frog legs, whatever perks give additional DR, strong back, and I forget the rest. But I can take a beating before I'm downed
---
Probably much more than 73. You don't get perk packs every level after a certain point(i think level 10 or 15). I'm lv 44 and I only got around dozen packs since then. On a side note, I was lucky enough to get pretty much all my favorite perks before level 10. Frog legs, Master Commando, Grenadier, Long Shot.
---
I was thinking about starting 76 back up again. But if they put in a Battle Royale mode I think I'd rather delete it.
---
Wolves hunt in packs
---
1. Yes but I recommend rebinding push to talk. 
---
2. Don’t goto death claw island or your not gonna have a good time. 
---
3. Very open.you can’t go into every building but there are a lot that you can the map is 4 times the size of fallout 4 and has so much story to tell. I spent my first two days with the game exploring around the map running into tons of new and cool stuff.
---
4. Good luck there’s a lot of friendly players out there so if you need help just ask someone or ask on here.
---
How many points and what tree is frog legs in?
---
Putting your camp down 4 times, I think. I did it like 10 times and got lots of perk cards. But none of them since seem to be working, so I think they need to fix something and have turned them off.
---
I found "y'all" to be an invaluable tool in my time as a bartender in New York. Approximately 0% of humans want to have a conversation with their bartender about their pronouns and 0% of New York bartenders have time for that conversation. Y'all makes it a non-issue.
---
I’ve heard that. I should do Whitesprings first to make sure I have enough fluids and masses to farm effectively. I’ve got two keycards and I am level 95, long past time I did it.
---
There's a hazmat suit in the atom shop? Is it functional or just cosmetic?
---
Im on PC, PM me your IGN and ill add you. Though i play on odd hours as i work nights but still play pretty much all weekend.
---
Lucky for you that it isn’t
---
Yeah that’s right
---
I could be wrong, but I thought Charisma influenced the success of pacification for creatures/monsters?
---
Frog legs is 9 points and in agility. 300% extra jump height is great, especially when being used to marsupial
---
That honestly has never happened to me I had a guy try hitting me with a super sledge a minute ago but I led him into a pack of mole miners and left him
---
It actually isn't a good sign to me if they just go to the BR.. just like with fortnite.. if the BR becomes the popular thing then they will ditch the PvE game..
---
Its here to stay
---
Someone else saw DCDeacon, who is Pete Hines. So I wouldn't be surprised to see other devs and employees testing it right along with us.
---
It's not that nobody wanted the mode, it's that nobody wanted the game to be ONLY this mode, which was a legitimate concern back when the game was announced.
---
All I find there, + 1 squirrel. Don't scare em, they run fast!
---
Damn onion-cutting ninjas. 
---
I'm on PC but I'll look for the place.
---
Np. Thought I might as well say it cause no one currently spawns at mill often and as soon as some youtuber realizes that 3-4 crates spawn there ever time they will make a vid about it then RIP my mill.
---
It's ok, but not great. Junk Piles and Lead nodes are better.
---
Yeah, I attempted to favorite the tin foil outfit and realized this. :/
---
r/ladydevann can you please for the sake of our thumb eye coordination put this post in sight of the right people. We’ve been suffering since at least fallout 4! 🙏🏻
---
I say the combat/lever action snipers are gr9, but the hunting rifle/ revolver are terrible. They've got no finishing power, coupled with a slow weapon swap speed due to the stickiness of the scope (sometimes I'm locked in for the duration of the bolt animation), and the fact that a headshot is 100% survivable from either one makes me avoid at all costs.
---
Wait, Seriously?  I thought they were removing it after free trial, then releasing it in full at a later date.
---
Gonna be a real grind. I really hope when the full release comes out that there will be a single player mode in NW I'm tired of getting paired with people who just sit back and do nothing.
---
Bethesda announced today it was sticking around because of the positive feedback.
---
My build is called `duplicator` and i had probably the most duplicate perk cards.....
---
Spend it
---
Please change how the game handles people quitting as well, currently if you down someone and they leave the server you don't get any kill XP or any dropped loot.
---
Are you kidding?
---
Yeah, that's my go to. I got tired of "team mates" using the rest of the team as fodder and not actually being team-y. I now survive way longer. Haven't won a match yet, but since I've never played a BR game before ever, getting to top 3 is pretty good in my book, lol.
---
Bolstering/vanguard and bos combat
---
No problems today ! At least for now !
---
Salt PEAnuts Salt PEAnuts
---
Killer. I was worried I wouldn't be able to get the blue camo paint for laser and PA.
---
Metal
---
Actually the radium is one of the best weapons in the game esp for pvp
---
Seems fine today. Will try to figure out where my CAMP went. After rebuilding it, no wrkbench, no cooking station.
---
lol
---
I saw a guy "sitting" and sliding around the entire match in my NW team once. I assume it was just a visual glitch on my side not cheating, but it was funny.
---
I wish I had a video.
---
- Drop rockets and grenade launcher ammo
---
- don’t use rocket launchers
---
- just keep the stuff you really need
---
- don’t hord tons of junk and weapons and armor (you won’t use it)
---
- don’t buy from vending machines since they are way to expensive (the ones at train stations, not player vending machines)
---
- don’t rush through the main quest, take your time
---
- don’t do the „mayor for a day“-quest before level 50 (the rewarded melee level is pretty good and scales with your level)
---
- check your misc for unnecessary and unscrapable stuff and drop it (burned books)
---
That’s all I can think of at the moment.
---
Welcome to the game fellow dweller!
---
I’m ok with it being more useful in one mode than another. 
---
What we need is not to change the rifle, but have more enemies who are bugged by rads.
---
i can never find one there. too many people around whitesping killing everything
---
Depth of field is that blurred distance effect, turn it all the way down in setting it's much better.  You can also turn it totally off in the .ini files
---
Top right corner of main menu has a message that says its staying
---
Interesting. I’ve been using downed people as bait all week and have a few kills because of it. Also people did it in Apex a lot during its first month. But then again I’m a dad who only plays for about an hour a night. So my sample size is small.
---
Stop being a shitter and use mouse and keyboard.
---
Thats what I was afraid of, meaning we'll never actually be getting a real X-02 power armor. :(
---
As a PS4 player, could we get a fix for Daily and weekly challenges? The Nuclear Winter challenges (like use 5 stimpaks) I've done but got no credit.
---
FO76: The part of NPCs and dialogue will be taken from the other players.  
---
Also FO76: Kill all the other players.
---
yea. the higher you get you unlock PA paints and weapon paints. those are dope.
---
Fireproof was changed, and now gives both fire resistance AND explosive resistance.
---
&gt;add atoms as a prize and there gain.
---
There is gain, which is exactly my point.  Already you gain exclusive cosmetics, you gain perks to use, you gain access to story content, and you gain the sense of satisfaction for winning a match; Atoms have no more tangible real world value than any of those, which was my point.
---
Reducing player incentive to keep people from being tempted to cheat is just about the most rediculous anti-cheat method I've ever heard anyone suggest.
---
I wanted to do metal, but it didn’t feel right. Also it was super expensive to repair.
---
I just won a game, thanks to a level 52 who single handedly took out everyone. I just ran behind him, pretending like I knew what I was doing. Our whole team survived. Was awesome.
---
Oh cool that's awesome
---
The constant whining and bitching from pve players in adventure on pvp mechanics are to blame. 
---
Guys wanted no pvp In adventure I guess they can deal with the consequences if adventure doesn’t see as much love.
---
Because if there was no content this game would go stale and that's the last thing we need. Add content, fix it when they have time in between projects.
---
No mods, just standard weapons I think..
---
Level 44 for that amazing pink sprinkles PA set...oh god.
---
Do athlete, swimmer and the one with the crossbow. All super easy and prettzfast to obtain.
---
People have been using swords and dancing behind corners in Destiny for 5 years.
---
Glad the games bringing in new people. I don’t blame people for being hesitant with the shit release and bad press
---
Dupes legendaries and leagacy weapons make it unfun. The balance in NW and the almost auto teaming really jazz up FO76. More friend more fun.
---
GT Garvieee :)
---
Just helped my team win a round. We didn’t actually set it off but it did take out a lot of others :)
---
I just dropped some guns and ammo on him. Hope he finds it useful.
---
Thank you. I really appreciate it ❤️ I am very sorry to hear that. I wish I could provide you with the proper words to help you feel better. I am very sorry again. Enjoy the time you have. I know you will. My gamertag is cmccoy6. I won’t be on before I leave tomorrow but I’ll be home next week and will gladly let you know. Thank you again and I am very sorry to hear about your dad ❤️
---
How does photomode from Adventure mode help in NW? All I'm getting is your team was killed by some people Twitch streaming. lol
---
Thank you much, sorry he shot you.
---
No they have been disabled according to reports on here, due to issues
---
ill come back for wastelanders
---
&gt;no one does imposter sheepsquatch cause they dont want to spend 2k caps.
---
It's not the money, it's the complete lack of notification, and to a lesser extent the horse shit rewards. If they want people to play it they need to add a 2 minute warning like they do for nuke drops so that people have a minute to drop what they're doing, dump their junk, and FT to the event. 
---
&gt;no one does arctos pharma.
---
See above. No one does this event for the same reason.
---
&gt;sbq is boring ammo dump.
---
Agree to disagree on this. 
---
&gt;purveyor legendary spawns sucks way too often.
---
It's RNG. Sure, there are some things that objectively suck, but lots of useful stuff comes out. Even if it's not suited for your build you can now throw it in a vending machine so someone else can use it, which is more than we could do with shit drops before we had her.
---
&gt;Badges are bugged.
---
Some, but it's not like you *have* to do them. You can earn badges by completing the 3 new scout events, so if you're grinding for backpack mods you can still get them.
---
&gt;maybe when they release npcs it will pick up better
---
I don't know why I bothered typing out the rest of this comment, you're obviously one of those "It SuCkS BeCaUsE tHeRe'S nO nPc'S!!!" people.
---
Oh man it would be super fun if they released a  GECK/Creation Kit sort of thing where we can make maps, and then they could be voted on, and put into the game.
---
I’m on Xbox 😭
---
Lmao.  
---
Dream scenario.
---
I just won my first game yesterday it's pretty damn fun. I'm enjoying it a lot more to be honest. It's actually well made.
---
I suck so hard at NRs and got a victory without killing a single play. Guy nuked the zone. I ran into the fire of safety and won.
---
first piece of good advice, ty
---
Isnt the excavator power armour easy to get?there is like 3 steps to the quest...
---
And people running around wearing nothing more than underwear and a major league esque mascot head launching teddy bears out of a cannon doesn't trigger you?
---
Hahaha quicktime. Fair enough. I usually just button mash until it does what I want. Maybe this is why everyone keeps losing their weapons... In reality, the interface is exactly that... a console port. They designed around controller and added PC controls as an afterthought.
---
That’s absolutely okay lol. My gamertag is cmccoy6 anytime I’m on I’ll be there. I don’t care if you wreck my base or not. Just don’t destroy the vase that has gumpy over it ❤️
---
I agree, cheaters ruin it for everyone, but I don't think there's a more ridiculous anti-cheat method than to intentionally limit rewards to keep people from being too tempted.
---
&gt; give a gain and there become more common. 
---
My point was that there's already plenty of "gain" in the game, if you're withholding Atoms to prevent cheating, why not continue the methodology? /s
---
Pretty good list, although I wouldn't know about melee. I'll dispute a few points:
---
1. Robot head damage was always low, likely intentional. Figured that out back in BETA. I guess they took a shortcut on the number coloring.
---
2. Explosive damage numbers may well be correct (or no more wrong than the other numbers). I tested self-splash with explosive weapons a while back and it did depend on DR as well as explosion reduction (eg Dense).
---
3. It's possible that the radant's whole body counts as a weak spot. Their HP is pretty high but they die quite easily when you land the shots.
---
Typically level 14s aren't trying to do level 70 things. If you really really want to kill an Imposter, just wait for someone else to do the event, and join it. Or try asking for a group in Discord or something?
---
I’d like the environment to be more of a factor in adventure. Instead of Hordes as “events” you have to defend your base more often ... companions add to their target rating and your defenses and companions defend if you are not there. Companions come in “flavors” and may have randomized skins (trader, farmer, musician as you say) and give some small bonuses but the amount of them increases your chances of being attacked or raided.
---
Kinda like FO4 settlements. The more people you have, the more defenses you need to build.
---
Same that just sounds ridiculous.
---
So we agree. When they manage to actually rework this and provide us pc players with a real user experience, and not some afterthought-workaround, then I might come back to buy this game and play it after the free week.
---
But maybe the game will become free to play anyway in the next months, who knows.
---
Theres no server stability. I think the servers themselves are crashing a ton because "it just works" isn't magic enough to make a game actually stable.
---
I always where some kind of outfit so what it looks like doesn’t really matter. Invest into white knight or use Sneak. When I’m being all tanky and I’m using a hammer I use white knight. When I’m stealth killing with a knife a use sneak you won’t have to repair your armor much plus use fix it good when you repair your armor to fix its condition 200%. It won’t be a problem.
---
Cool thanks
---
Darn
---
Yes. That is exactly what I am planning on doing. I won’t be back until next Wednesday but when I get back I have a ton of players who are more than willing to be there which means the world to me. If you are on Xbox my gamertag is cmccoy6. I’ll invite everybody who wants to be a part of it. Thank you again ❤️
---
You’re right, but still I’d rather wear it in Nuclear Winter and look sleek with my marine and scout armor on rather than the ugly vault-tec suit
---
1 person can old all 3 pylons, but I suggest having a really good Vampire weapon before you even try that.
---
I’m pretty sure you get the kill when you down an enemy but another one cleans up.
---
Where would you drop? I know flatwoods and river gorge have 2 close to eachother, is there a better spot?
---
Finally found the tourist at the graveyard.  Feels like I have been searching for weeks to find her.
---
For future reference you can still get the wisdom from a dead wise moth man. I may know this cause the first one I randomly saw I might have accidentally shot knowing no better.
---
I totally agree.
---
I strongly suspect some players don't care about kills or winning and care about the xp. That would be ok, but when you get teamed up with them it sucks. While in general I think br shouldn't be all about kills, in NW they're barely worth anything.
---
Some of them have mods. Like scopes, or automatic and non auto mods.
---
I started playing like a month ago, and this type of thing wasn't present when I started playing. Only one guy has followed me to continually shoot me and another shot me once to see if I was AFK.
---
I think the free week has brought out some crap players, but if all else fails switch servers. It's not guaranteed to get better but it most likely will.
---
Bought from player vendor at 30cap a piece, bought all 9 he had left to share around my toons. So just have to luck across 6 more for my other 2 toons.
---
One of the challenges most likely.
---
Cranberry Bog
---
thats because the gunplay is terrible so bad that its all fair!
---
What, it's not like you were lucky enough to find two lvl 62 3*ghouls in 5 minutes, killed them and got vanilla lvl 20 drills.  
---
The game has terrible drops.  C'est la guerre.
---
Vending*
---
I'm on the fence about it, personally I find the damage is a bit too low and the recoil is wayyy too high in NW. A .45 smg does the job much better.
---
It shows that they're so creatively bankrupt that they thought the idea was good enough that they should say, "Fucking," while announcing it.
---
Oh lets just put a over saturated thing everyone is already sick of into a game that's already doing terribly!
---
WOO HOO!
---
Dang wish I got those perk cards, guess its the super long grind for me.
---
Okay, I’m glad I’m not the only one that’s happening too. Haha. 
---
Yeah, that has happened to me, too. I just wait a few minutes and try again and then it works.
---
Yeah.
---
It sucks
---
I've been saying this from the start. Legendaries and vats are no good for PvP. In survival mode it doesnt matter what you have since the armor nerf. It takes like 4 shots to kill anyone no matter what. Or 1 melee hit.
---
How do I disable the fill option please? Only played a couple off rounds of me so far
---
Whitesprings has been a ghost town this week with all the low levels hanging out in the forest. This is probably the best chance you'll have.
---
I can't do the Toxic Waste daily.  Even adding it at the terminal, once I talk with the bot, nothing happens.  The terminal lets me add talking to him again, but the quest itself never starts.
---
Good, now I can confirm I'm not missing much.
---
Yeah. I was just trying to give some tips to maybe make it more tolerable. I've gotten used to it and my enjoyment of the game far outweighs any of my complaints.
---
I guess there are cowards that need cheap kills still but that's still frowned upon.
---
Ugh, you're one of those people. You know that's one of the only spots for the rare robo vendor to spawn and that by camping there you're preventing it from happening, right?
---
If only I had room in my base to make another structure to blueprint lol
---
No he spawns there still. Iv seen him twice and didn't know why ppl thought he was rare. It spawns more over towards that building so you can't block his spawns.
---
A lot of this is incorrect info and/or never happened to me. 0 rocket launchers seen, never start in third person and there is a timer for location to select
---
Honestly, I wish there were, like, Pacifist PvE Adventure servers. If I'm flagged Pacifist, put me there and change the way Workshops function altogether. If something is locked by a player no one can even try to take it. Just let me PvE only. 
---
I'd welcome it now more than ever because if I want to PvP, I'm going to NW or Survival. That's two full PvP-only options while there is technically no PvE-only option. I'm not saying get rid of Adventure the way it is now. It can stay, of course! Just offer Adventure PvE-only and Adventure Classic (the way it is now). I'd start throwing cash at the game.
---
There is a note in Helvetia that mentions the possibility of the robots deciding to celebrate Fasnacht whenever they like, so maybe they'll eventually make it a rare random event?
---
There's no set prices, people just tend to sell certain things for certain price ranges, but the market fluctuates depending on supply and demand, just like IRL markets.
---
You're best bet is to browse the trading subs and see what people are paying for the items youre looking to sell.
---
I'm with you. Honestly I'll be pretty turned off if I have to have a companion for any content. It's not the sort of thing I would think fits into 76 anyway but I guess that's what the people want.
---
Id really like to see locked first person or seperate queue, 3rd person is too easy to abuse.
---
I might have to double check but pacifist mode never turned itself off for me.
---
Metal with grounded mutation.
---
Part of it almost sounds like an intro to one of the old Sam Raimi spiderman movies to me lol
---
Whitesprings or Harpers Ferry/Burrows during a nuke, West Tek, Robco, Pylon V13 occasionally has a legendary behemoth.
---
I'd settle for Lionel Richie
---
GT is the same ♥️♥️
---
Tips
---
Early on do the Leader of the Pack event every time you see it, it’s a good way to get low level legendary weapons
---
Try and keep your store of stashed material to less than 80 of each broken down material- exceptions are aluminium, screws, springs, adhesive and steel and wood if you are building lots. Ballistic fibre too, but you’ll never find that much. 
---
Powering Up Poseidon is a good mission to do a few times early, it’s how you get plans for better generators for your camp.
---
Taking workshops is a good way to get camp plans and do- just be careful as some people will try and go for you if you are working there.
---
on PlayStation it's the square before you "Join"
---
Look under the popup thing when you first hit the Nuclear Winter tile.
---
Auto assault
---
Auto handmade
---
Lever action
---
Scoped combat rifle
---
Scoped lever action
---
For starters..
---
It doesn’t move until it fly’s away. As far as I know, you can’t kill that one.
---
It can spot players for you? Sounds really cheese tbh
---
The imposter event is a bit unusual for perk requirements. I spent about 10 perk points specially for it. Above level 50 it's mostly upgrading your legendaries though.
---
I agree with your main point. The finale doesn't remotely match the difficulty of the rest of the quest, which fills a mid-level gap. It also has prep time problems, so you have very little chance of succeeding unless you start it with a team who can handle the pylons without assistance. None of this is clear before you start it, so it's basically a trap to make you waste your keycard.
---
Thanks for the tip! /s
---
I always spawn by this one house that seems to have an orange crate like 80% of the time. It's great.
---
cool story bro.
---
3 points well worth it. My radaway consumption is kept to a minimum. I am still annoyed I get rads from collecting dirty water though.
---
Shit, I always figured dudes was non-identifying.. lol. At least that's how I've always used it. I call anyone duder or dude.
---
Yeah, if it was crusader kings the dog would romance you and usurp the throne to start the 1000 year glitterwoof dynasty.
---
You actually need over 450 because the terminal is glitched
---
Perk that allows any animal to become companion ?
---
This is FO76. We need nukes.
---
Submit a ticket.
---
I find it hard to not get discouraged when I get killed immediately after spawning in from people who got weapons before I could even move my character and then have to wait through all the load screens and waiting periods.
---
None of them produce enough resources to really be a profit center. Just figure out what you need most and find one of those nodes. I bounce around between junk, acid, and lead depending on what I need.
---
done that 10 times just now and havent seen one yet
---
&gt;added 73 new Perk Cards, some of which can only be used during Nuclear Winter matches.
---
How do we access the ones in Adventure? Do we have to earn them through Nuclear Winter in order to get them in Adventurem
---
If you're heavy in the special strength you can always swap all the important shotgun perks with your melee perks
---
Bethesda: Fixing bugs but don’t release content
---
Players: There’s nothing to do, where‘s the new content?
---
Bethesda: Releasing new content 
---
Players: Stop releasing content, take care of the bugs first!
---
I don't think so. I think it's because of a discounted item purchase.
---
The Mothman at that event is non-hostile and non-legendary. The only "loot" you missed otu on was whatever random crap/caps a normal mothman would have dropped.
---
It's in stored, second tab
---
im using the exact opposite of what i use in adventure mode lol
---
Master Rifleman with Adrenalin and you oneshot people left and right.
---
I’m so glad everyone liked it it made me worry for a little while
---
The loading screens do make it 1000x worse
---
Because you do not know does not mean it is incorrect.  Come on man.
---
I second. It does make random encounters suck.
---
Why are they always building huge turret houses there?
---
Thought I may have been missing something. I have overseer lvl 5, and never once got a new adventure level. Even after switching and playing. Other than my regular levels from spending a few hours nuking whitesprings and grinding. I’ve received nothing.
---
“A nuclear winter winter group”
---
To be fair it's not the game itself that's the problem it's the very outdated Frankenstein monster of a game engine it's built on, which Bethesda refuses to do anything with sadly. But yeah the game was fun for me too until the abysmal technical state reared it's head.
---
*Legendary Behemoth you say???*
---
Hey dude, i took your advices and was able to get tons of acid/steel! Thanks for this, ammo shouldn't be a problem
---
They are always around my camp. Head up north of White Spring on the road, past the Spawn zone thingie, past the RR station and past the next spawn thingie. Take a right directly after in the grass, down a rock...pass the first pond with a blue tarp, there's a second pond. Rabbits are always here. 
---
Short Version: Go to North Cutthroat Camp, facing north right after that, go southeast slightly to the second pond area.
---
no. honestly i dont really like NPCs. in every fallout game i just skip what they say. Ive also played fo76 almost daily since beta and i preordered it and supported it besides month i took off to play ac odyssey. I spent real money on the atom shop as well to support Bethesda. I dont mean a small 10$. Maybe about 100$ or so. I stuck with the game with all its bugs and im not telling people to not play it. After a while it is going to get dry. I joined discord groups to keep the spark alive. Even did some habits i did in fallout 3,nv,and 4's end game. Like exploring and building camps. The game gets dry.
---
What I meant by npcs will pick it up better because with new settlments and npcs appearing, as juicehead suggested, there may be a faction system. Support the raiders or the other settlments. Give me purpose as supposed to "let me guess, they are dead. cause everyone is dead."
---
Come on man.. I want this crap to stop not promote the most efficient means to do it.
---
They've made a few nerfs &amp; balance adjustments, but they haven't added or removed any. Demo Expert got nerf from ~100% bonus damage to +60%. White Knight got nerfed, but I've never used it so I haven't been paying attention to what they did. 
---
The one positive is that change to fireproof that u/malaclypse333 mentioned. 2 ranks of that perk almost completely negate the damage from scorchbeast scream attacks as well as eliminating almost all the splash damage from TSE weapons.
---
That Bethesda Doesn't listen to what we want. Instead of bug fixes and new additions to Adventure and Survival. We get a Battle Royale. Weeeeeeee wee. Yay. Go todd
---
Fair, ill delete those comments
---
What did you expected? You got warned, they are bears. They are maul you, like a real bear would.
---
But, try to hug a sheepsquatch. Real one, not impostor. They are fluffy little lambs.
---
Aiming well seems to be 90% of what it takes to be successful in NW. Which is probably why I lose 90% of the time I start shooting at someone :)
---
No, what lie did Todd admit to telling us?
---
You definitely should, I was never a BR fan but it's actually pretty fun
---
This happened to me the other day!
---
I also found an injured Super Mutant limping through the forest, babbling about the sheepsquatch coming after him and his brother dying to it. Definitely the strangest encounter I’ve had in the game.
---
If it makes you feel any better most of them were meh. :p
---
&gt; PVE character. You only get one perk card fo
---
thank you for your useful reply! I want to play a stealth melee character focussed both on PvE and PvP. I do not like to wear Power Armor. With that in mind, what should I go for? Unarmed? 1H? 2H seems out of the question because of the one shot protection and 2H is much better with a PA..
---
This is just a sneak peak, probably best to wait and see how they handle the mode when it’s officially live.
---
60 or 120 extra carry weight?  You tell us, it's your account.
---
Hey there, I am also a trial user, maybe played for 5 hours or so, I can see why the game try to feature no NPCs, is sort of a way to easily ignored the lore if you are not that into it, also the game is put together in a way that make the encounters and team creations and quest starters to be quick and enjoyable online, first time I played approach some dude use the hello emote, we started a group quest around for 1 hour, found another dude team grew bigger, and the way the towns look so deserted, the whole environment feel so encapsulating.  I really regret talking shit about this game without even play it before, I will definitely get the base game, I hope this awesome community take me in.
---
Also on a side note, I see that Todd howard really put a lot of hopes into this game, and being a 35 year old dude myself I have played all of todds games and I can see why he loves this game, and why he has so much plans for it. I hope more people would give this game a try, also I hope we can have more than 10 people on the map, and be able to log in on the same map if needed.
---
Sorry for the rant.
---
Is marine armor obtainable? If so use that
---
Wes Tek has an FEV research lab in Appalachia and was experimenting on the population of Huntersville.  That’s why it and Wes Tek research are their home base.  Some of the raider logs talk
---
about them spreading from there and pushing the raider population out.
---
I'm in. I've gotten back into it after the E3 presentation and it's been a blast. There are tons of newbies though and hopefully some stay after the free week is over.
---
It does, thank you. lol
---
It's not even that, really. Due to player trading, you can max out your power level fairly quickly, if you want to. It's not like a normal looter shooter with strict RNG-based incremental gains. Past level 50 you basically pick how strong you want to be, and then do what you like.
---
Yes. Approach with caution. They will one hit almost anything and they're the biggest bullet sponge in the game other than the queen. The best advice I can give you is cripple the legs and attack from behind while he's limping along.
---
Are you for real? You’re offering to pay money for the right to use items you’ve already unlocked fair and square?
---
I can never understand people offering to pay additional for content they’ve already paid for, and that should just be included as standard, it’s literally the reason for the poor state of the gaming industry nowadays and the constant money grabbing habits. 
---
Probably not even their own cash in the first place, hence why they’d be so happy to throw it away.
---
So you’re the one who had more patience than me the other night.   Of course you had a ranged weapon. All I had was a board to kill those two dopes
---
So if you downed a few people and then some guy from another team killed last guy on the team you were wiping up and he got all the kills you would be alright with that like “yeah he deserves those no problem.”?
---
No good?
---
That’s why I said and/or. The no timer for deployment selection is incorrect also starting in third person only happens if your in third person when in vault. Plus too many rocket launchers is incorrect
---
I hope they put the red crest from the centurion helmet on a less goofy helmet, like a steel colored army helmet or something, I'd spend some atoms on that.
---
That’s what I thought. But Bethesda did change the lore to fit that somewhat. I guess you could always say no one knew of these SM since it is so early and they think SM came from Cali or wherever they are from
---
I'll definitely give it a go! I've seen a Behemoth maybe 3 times and two of those were during the BETA. Dunno why they never seem to spawn in my games.
---
Nah I just found it funny it’s kind of like atm machine and PIN number. Like the word after it is already in the acronym :P
---
No you’re all good man! Thanks for the input I’m glad someone feels the same way!
---
I’m 62 and don’t know what I’m trying to accomplish half the time (sidetracked, stoned, blah blah) but am always having a blast simply playing and interacting with others. Good luck out there fellow wastelander.
---
Automatic weapons and spray and pray.
---
do you know where it is exactly? i can only find the two squirrels there
---
Oh.. lol shit I didn't even realize I did that. 
---
Hey I did say I was drinking whiskey... lol.
---
“Who’s gonna play this?” They said.. Congrats to Bethesda!
---
The event was just a week. Keep an eye open in stores though, the masks are selling for as little as 100 caps.
---
Book of Eli. Eli did pretty good!
---
Yeah, you're good, bro. Enjoy the wastelands 😎
---
You didn't check very far.
---
Seriously so in the times yo locate, load, load vault 51 need to be reduced.. 
---
Why are you so distraught?
---
You need to do the tourist side quests for that. Find dead tourist, read note, do the things.
---
Go to the junk tab on your pip boy. One of the options should be "component view", I think it's RB on xbox. Clicking that shows you a full list of all junk, including things you don't actually have. Scroll down the list and tag the things you're looking for, and then any junk you find in the world that contains your material will have a magnifying glass next to it.
---
They said they are not taking it down.  It is here to stay.
---
&gt;armor.
---
I don't really have to rule the game or anything. I would like to hop into survival, run towards the #1 player and just wreck his shit from sneak/stealthboy. with that in mind, should I opt for unarmed or 1h/2h?
---
Rubbish man game is great now, low amount of bugs, give more content.... i know been here for almost 1000 hours. Get over the money grabbing negative youtubers that spent an hour in the game to get content for a video.just explore the thousands of amazing things in this great game, make friends❤️
---
They said on their twitter today that it's staying now.
---
Honestly, we don't need perks that buff certain weapon's damage. It'll break the mode.
---
Good info, thank you
---
I’m not going in because I’ve completed all the quests and XP/loot farming is boring for me. Nuclear Winter is just really fun and new with good guaranteed rewards. I’ll be back in adventure full time for Wastelanders and I expect that many others will come back then too (or actually before for the Vault Raids).
---
Also there is a perk card you can obtain later on that lets you revive players with alcohol. It’ll then give you an option for either one if you have both in inventory using a different button it’ll display.
---
Even now, I've got most of the other badges done, just knocking out one or two items every couple days in the list.  Some you can double up on.  Like just finished the railway one.  Part of it is craft 50 spikes, kill 15 monsters in like 4 locations.  I knocked that all out in like one session.  It's not like there is any other new content to do, so  just nibble away at it.
---
Only ones I haven't done are ones that have been broken since release, which is annoying.
---
I just got an email notifying me that my ticket was updated and that they shipped it out. UPS notified before that though. I was totally confused because I had no idea what it was until Bethesda's email.
---
I'm level 40. I've never seen this event before until today
---
Same here. I've been helping newbies out in between checking tasks off some of the Possum badges.
---
Overload yourself with Rads. It's another modifier to add on top of others so they stack for crazy high damage
---
I’ve had several very low level players at my camp. I’ve given them ammo, food, water, the gift bag goody treatment. It was going great until a lvl 8 decided he was gonna pick a lock. He was with two other players in a squad. He got himself wanted, I gave him an education. They all had mics so after I collected the bounty I bought a single bullet from him for the same amount and didn’t take his junk. None of them realized they could be put in pvp if a squad mate got wanted. They also didn’t know taking a workshop could result in a pvp situation. 
---
We wound up going to a workshop and I took it. Then I stripped naked and let them take the workshop from me and vice versa. They were very thankful for the demonstrations and such and tried to repay me which was nice. But I refused payment and asked them to just pay it forward and reserve their judgment on the game until they hit lvl 25 or 30. They were elated.
---
But can you scrap it for ballistic fiber?
---
Which weapons?
---
It doesn’t need you to hold it? I sure thought it did on my PS4. Hmm. I’m going to have to test this out. I don’t wear PA a lot either. So maybe I’m totally wrong about holding it. Thanks.
---
It's not like I'm counting, but I'd feel like there's one near Bogtown /  V-13 roughly 1/3 of the times I'm in the area, and probably a 50/50 chance of it being a legendary.
---
I'm sorry but that's a bad excuse for having bad aim. Aiming works just fine for me on Ps4.
---
You should've used less vats in adventure
---
build in adventure mode at a workshop so you use workshop pool of mats first, blueprint it
---
I have a 2 story with a floor trap that makes a sound when someone enters from the advanced power connectors plan. 
---
I wouldn't use more than 1 foundation or you will have trouble planting the blueprint, just build foundation/stairs up then build the base.
---
Yeah. I wish I would've known that. But I'm not gonna waste almost all my caps on an event that I'll never complete
---
Yes, but i had reinstalled them a couple weeks ago due to logitech putting out that g hub crap.
---
worked perfectly fine until earlier today and now half the game sounds are missing.
---
Nice. I've been running around the Flatwoods between the cottages and homesteads helping the new guys clear the scorched out. Making sure I don't one shot the mobs so the new guys can get the loot and exp
---
Sall good. Figured as much.
---
You don't need high health if you're one-shotting everything.
---
I thought the quest finished once you reached Wolf's trap thing and that's where the event takes place
---
Any of them. I find pistols and sniper rifles all the time. I can unequip Class Freak and put Cowboy and Rifleman on no problem and easily kill someone if I get the drop first.
---
Thank you for your quick response! What things can you stack for that kind of damage?
---
Congrats.
---
My rig runs literally everything fine with the exception of fallout 76.
---
Bethesda has a track record of shit graphical coding with their Frankenstein engine. The community has had to fix their problems with every game before this.
---
I will say, sometimes the team spawns in a bad area. Like a lookout tower that has two containers that could not supply all members of the team, or the middle of nowhere.
---
Yeah, but they’re making changes and adding more locations to battle and stuff. I don’t doubt by the time it’s a more polished version, they’ll implement some way to increase xp earned or something
---
Ha! Good point!
---
All games have issues with scaling on exponentials ... bloodied is a multiplier on damage that’s pretty good ... adrenal reaction mutation stacks on the same axis (damage increase based on low health) ... so by dropping a single stat, you scale exponentially on your damage increase.
---
^^ What this guy said it says at the main menu.
---
Sturdy has the cage, Heavy has the skin stretched over it.
---
I dont think its intended for the average player to obtain max level within a few weeks or even months.
---
this.  workshops are transitory, there's no benefit or need to build one up.   
---
Keep it simple, just build enough generators to power the extractors you want, throw down a couple turrets, and call it good.  If you get disconnected or some other player comes along and takes it from you it's no big loss.
---
Unyielding armor for best results
---
Yeah games like fortnite hide a lot of the loading as riding on the bus, bethesda should try and figure out something like that.
---
If the #1 player is a noob who became the leader by an accident, you have any chances an its irrelevant which weapon you select TBH. But if you fight against someone who know what they are doing, and you are not using spawn protection invincibility bullshit, then melee is useless in PvP.
---
What isn’t working? Need details.
---
OMG I've encountered them twice at WHITESPRINGS
---
A few buttons should be separate like exit power armor and revive teammate. Loot and sit. Attach wire and jump. There are only so many buttons though... Maybe a trigger switch similar to how ffxiv implemented for controllers? It was cumbersome at first but added a lot of diversity to "hot keys".
---
Didn't buy the game at launch dude. Tried it out on redbox to see how it was.
---
Why so negative over such an insanely minor thing?
---
Depends on the weapon. Each weapon style has a set of perks that help them out
---
This is an amazing summary, great work. I missed most of the Battle Royale uproar, but damn, isn’t that ironic now? The new mode is so much fun.
---
I hope we continue to grow as a community and more and more people give this game a chance. It deserves it!
---
Any chance we will get an exploreable vault 51 in adventure that still uses NW ranks so we can explore without being in a queue?
---
Looks a bit like nylon...
---
Nah kidding - congrats! :)
---
Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was gone from the 10th to the 17th so I was REALLY worried I would completely miss this! And now they've extended it indefinitely!!!!
---
Y'all got me wrong, the game is great I'm not denying that, and I dont watch any youtubers that play 76 or anything like that, I'm not trying to hate on the game, I was just trying to say that there are loads of bugs that have been here since day 1 that still arnt fixed, I just played for an hour early and had to restart 4 times cause Rose's quests went popping up and I ended up having to Google where to go cause nothing was on the map,(the David Thorne quest) and then got stuck trying enter power armor and could do anything at all, another restart, they're very stupid and annoying bugs, nothing truly game breaking but the annoying ass bugs start adding up and makes the game just nasty, especially the graphical glitches that are present in 76 and previous fallout games, like I love the games I really do but I just feel as if its plagued but a shit ton of annoying little bugs. Im also on xbox so dont know how it is on PC or ps4
---
you get some resources for free when you start.  you can tell the free resources as it will show those in green text when you are building.  
---
So long as you don't use up all the green mats, nothing comes out of your stash.  So just build up using those free resources.  there's plenty to get some generators, resource extractors, and a couple turrets.  
---
I never spend my personal resources on workshops.  waste of mats even if you keep it for a long time.
---
Oh you know the game devs personally? Cool.
---
Its better at range lol unless you use melee.
---
Well I had nerf rage set up so that if I get in a shoot out my damage output  might boost up if I take a few bullets. That went out the door after 2 games tho lol. I really want ground pounder and frog legs! I keep getting duplicates and it’s pissing me off.
---
I'm not looking for a argument. I'm  sorry. You are right. Fallout 76 is complete and finished product and I'm going to play it for years. Good day to you fellow Vault dweller.
---
Okay. I answered it myself. It's max level regardless of your own.
---
Ants can't take fall damage.
---
I love fallout and I live pvp!! I'm no fan of battle royale stuff but I gotta do this after what yal have posted!!! So you in the wastes fuckers
---
The melee is atrocious though... I can manage a gun fight with a gun that recoils violently.. But hitting a player in the head with a club shouldn't require advanced mathematical calculations
---
Tru7h. It's why I prefer solo unless I'm with some buddies that know what we're doing.
---
Pretty sure the difference is minimal, also the way damage resist works in this game makes it less effective against bigger hits, if i'm not mistaken. So it's good against shotguns and stuff that deals many small hits.
---
gotcha fam. this is coming from a guy who bought the tricentennial new and is KICKING himself for it
---
I have tried killing him before to get the wing, he was invincible
---
Criticism incoming:
---
They need to take it down and fix. I  dont enjoy getting killed by a player that hasn't loaded in yet but has found a gatling gun, then watching their body spawn in head first as they rip my stomach open i with a zip of bullets.
---
I also feel the perk system for NW needs to be balanced or removed. If you make it so those who have played the longest benefit so much more than those starting out, you're going to kill the player pool. After awhile not many will want to play if they know theyre not going to stand up to someone who's played the mode for longer. Imo that's not how a FFA Battle Royale should work. 
---
Giving levels and rewards is fine, it's just cosmetic essentially. But giving perks to people that have played longer doesn't seem fair and using actual SPECIAL in the game is BS. I do almost 300 damage with a shotgun because I'm a shotgun build. Anyone unluck enough to go against me in a fight is going to do 68/75. That's not balanced at all. My friends a rifleman and uses crossbows to silently destroy the competition. They hit for like 180, no rifle perks. That's not fair to all the people he's 1 to 2 shotted in battle.
---
These really need to be fixed. Shit, I got a victory earlier today because some dude in PA doesn't stand a chance to my Combat Shotgun build.
---
I need to do this on XB1. If you need to pair up with someone, we can trade revives. GT is same as username here.
---
Running a Bloodied Heavy weapons build.
---
You can stack
---
* Bloodied legendary effect (More damage the lower your hp)
---
* Adrenal Reaction mutation (Same as Bloodied)
---
* Nerd Rage (20% more damage if below 20% of your hp)
---
* Weapon perks for up to 45% more damage (for example Heavy Gunner, Master Heavy Gunner, Expert Heavy Gunner)
---
* Bloody Mess for 15% more damage
---
* Tenderizer (7% more damage after your first hit on something)
---
* Adrenaline (Up to 60% more damage)
---
* Chems, such as Psychotats (Boosts your damage by 25%)
---
* If running Bloodied Melee build, you can use Unyielding legendary armor, which boosts your strength into pretty high numbers (More strength = More melee damage)
---
Might've missed something, but I'm not sure
---
I think just to keep it simple, it should be exactly as it is in Adventure mode. 1 shot or 20, if you get a shot in everyone get's the same experience of say (For sake of Argument) 50 xp. 
---
Then you should have rewards like 100 xp for killing 2 players within 10 seconds of one another 100 xp for your kills plus 50 xp for a "multi-kill". Killing someone at a certain distance should be +25xp or killing someone unarmed should be "berserker" +25 xp. 
---
Then at the end of the game +100 xp for most damage dealt or +100 xp for least damage taken for example.
---
Those other battle locations are probably close to being finished.  They were datamined not too long ago.
---
It does not seem out of their realm to have the Double XP apply to Overseer XP or buff the XP gains.
---
The biggest change they will most likely make is adding a way to immediately queue into another lobby without going through the main menu each time.
---
Will say though, my instigating explosive Lever and Railway Rifles are more than enough to one-shot all common infantry.
---
I don't use VATS really.
---
The battle royal did one thing...made the servers way worse than they were. I would maybe disconnect once evey 2 days. Now, since this has dropped I've been kicked 4 or 5 times EVERY session. An this is in adventure mode. I know its a prebeta but come on now this is ridiculous, especially when I had a bag full of junk get lost cause of server issues 2 times in a row. Bethesda needs to address this...an not nuclear fortnite for kids..
---
Good work! I found a PA frame when clearing out the flooded train yarn for the Rail Enthusiast badge and figured...why not? Took it to Vault 76, dropped it at the entrance, and five or ten minutes later a noob exited. Circled the frame. Came over to me. Went back to the frame, then entered it and ran off. Good laugh.
---
Kinda sorta but I’m using what I have on my main and an alt character too. I can dig around and see what I might have duplicates of. I’d also have to see why they’re worth in the market. I’d gladly take some stable fluorescent flux in trade instead of caps too (if you have that)
---
Ah, sorry. Well Happy hunting!
---
Gun fu really helps for mobs. 
---
Unfortunately it’s broken now but gun fu and adrenaline is a beauty combo.
---
Your complaint about the grind is valid, but why bring the atom shop into it? You don’t have to buy *anything* from the atom shop. There are literally hundreds of items to choose from in your CAMP (though, to be fair, you’ll need plans for a lot of them). There are hundreds of outfits to find in the game, with some of the most valued not in the atom shop at all. 
---
I repeat: You don’t have to buy *anything* from the shop. It’s all cosmetic stuff EXCEPT maybe repair kits. And despite all the bitching, those are just QoL changes that you can also earn in-game.
---
And if it works run that veil with the brotherhood of steel hood
---
80% EXPLOSIVE DAMAGE? HOLY SHIT BETHESDA.
---
I think someone found a few different maps in the latest datamine.
---
Heavy leather limbs with a heavy metal or Heavy BOS chest all upgraded to max with vanguards/bolstering would be the best armor (sentinels/cavs too but good luck getting a set like that quick and cheap). Throw in lone wanderer and dodgy as perks (and evasive/ironclad/barbarian) and use grounded and scaly skin mutations and boom you’ve got yourself the tankiest dr/er combo in the game
---
It also seems to cover up most of the screen when I try to aim, can't even see the scope. makes first person useless w/most weapons for me in it. (But only in this mode, don't have an issue in Adventure or Survival)
---
Ok thanks! And skin stretched over it?? O.o there’s still so much I don’t know, I’ll have to see that
---
Is the shit and is shit is completely different:-)
---
That's what most people thought at first but the quest to find the trap is miscellaneous, not part of the quest line. It's a bit confusing and anti-climatic to be honest.
---
I too would like to know if pvp scaling has had any fixes applied. I've experienced it from both sides, and couldn't find anything in the patch notes since christmas which indicated anything had been done when I glanced over them, though I could have missed it.
---
Same. I absolutely hate battle royales. I hated the idea of it in fallout. My friend convinced me to try it out.
---
I love it, and I’m glad it’s staying.
---
I’m on ps4 just sayin
---
+karma
---
That's weird and that sucks.  I guess I've been lucky but I've never lost anything.
---
I'd agree with you but raiders =/= griefers. I like pvp and messing with people but I'll only mess with someone in a way that they can engage with. Killing a players's cow and fast traveling away is like being invited to someone's house and punching a hole in the wall. Being a raider is more than just being an aggressive player.
---
I’ve been playing if about 5 days a week on average since launch, and every time I start getting bored something else pops up to keep me entertained. Finding a team to play with (I met people entirely in-game) has been a big help too
---
I'm hoping for the same. Since this is pretty much a beta, I keep hoping that when it gets fully released they will at least have a circle in each region and build on it later. Maybe each region haveing distinct NPC's and more of them.
---
Yes and no. Yes because you may have downed them, but you decided not to go for the actual kill, but no because he shouldn’t get credit for every kill just because he killed the final person.
---
If he had killed one of your downs and gave him credit, sure by all means, but not all four for one. You’re right.
---
If they can make enemies invisible in photomode it would solve the problem.
---
Hey Mr. Sack o' shit i never said anything about oneshotting the legendary. Now that IS being a sack o shit. I just dont wanna pick up logs for the billionth time. Let some noob do it cuz im tired of carrying them.
---
Nice. I've got a spare too now that I think about it. I've been farming t-60 pieces up by point pleasant so I've got 2 chassis sitting in my stash. I should take them up to the vault too.
---
That's so weak, it makes melee builds completely unviable for this mode.  And since they have so many perk cards for it, they clearly want melee to be used, so why make it impossible because of the time to kill?
---
Yeah, IIRC, the heavy one is rather odd.  It's got a bunch of metal "intestines" that comprise the midsection.
---
Everyone from BR to adventure has been super nice and helpful. Surprising to me tbh
---
Just wanted to add, the Jaws of Hakkon apply here too! My favorite Dragon Age DLC next to trespasser.
---
I remember, a PA frame is flat out the best thing to get early game
---
It is. I guess I’ll keep what I get from purveyor and try it out if she ever gives me Marine.
---
The scorched are infected and their brain has been turned to mush. They don’t worship anything, they don’t really even think. Just just exist
---
Absolutely
---
Now i wait for the tourists to leave so i can enjoy it.
---
I pref junk since it gives you random assortment
---
I was doing a run through the Robco research center for the possum challenges and also needed to do the challenge where you melt robots with a Flamer. So I thought perfect I’ll take a Flamer to Robco and kill two birds with one stone. Problem is it took every bit of Flamer fuel that I had just to kill one single Mr. gutsy.
---
And I had built and modded the flamer to peak damage. It is just useless.
---
Are you okay? 
---
Your reply has very little to do with what I said about fallout and it’s history of gunplay.
---
That sounds super fun!  I didn't bother trying to tame animals in 4 as we had Dogmeat but having a friendly bloatfly floating about sounds both cute and terrifying!
---
I hadn’t considered loading up on rads to keep my health low and didn’t know how to stack.
---
Hard bargain sucks don’t rely on traders prices are ridiculous. Get picklock and hacker instead
---
Thanks for the link to a video!  I'm going to try to use the trial to create a charisma heavy person to do some taming.  It always feels good to build with a character in mine.
---
I can fade the masks. They look dumb and don’t do anything special anyway, lol.
---
Dont worry it was probably a level 10 1* stalkers pipe pistol.
---
Yeah, Unique game elements per region would be amazing. Add random rad storms, unique enemies and unique weapons etc.
---
I can dig it.
---
Here’s a pic of a [heavy chest ](https://imgur.com/gallery/DnVNQEX) that I traded a couple weeks ago.
---
__Betty White is a national treasure.__
---
This is great! Thank you!
---
That is "real fallout means quests and rpg not chinese copy of pubg"
---
I mean, I don't really use any rifles, but it depends on your playstyle: Do you want to be a stealth sniper that kills everything in one shot (Besides bosses obviously) or do you want to use non automatic weapons like automatic ones?
---
When you enter photomode you can move the camera around and scan your surroundings without exposing your character. Its kinda an issue.
---
Also built a noob a small water purifier. I remember what a pain in the ass it was to drag dirty water over to the overseer's camp to boil it. Hey, I hope we aren't spoiling these kids!
---
Why not good? Just hard to unlock all mods - need to break 1000 rifles.  I'm playing with my anti armor radium in PVE, love it, AP cost much low than handmade. Absolutely unique rifle, no one has it :)
---
Is this up indefinitely? Kind of like how Survival is continuously playable but still technically labeled as a beta?
---
Sense of pride and accomplishment
---
Instead of getting rid of legendaries, you can turn them into a new currency called scrip which you can trade to the new purveyor vendor for randomized legendaries.
---
Wait, i understood this differently.. is it also visible through outfits? I could check this but im not at the house atm..
---
Well done! This is where the Adventure mode really shines when nice players such as yourself help out the lower ranked players 👍 That’s what really makes this mode for me 😊
---
Theres an option to turn it down on consoles
---
And radicool for 5 more strength.
---
Oh that’s why some of the stuff was green. Does the game ever explain that to you?
---
Z.A.X has Noted this In His Records.   Impressive Candidate
---
Vats crit build, grim reaper sprint, better criticals, four leaf clover, bloody mess, etc.
---
Oh, sorry- I’m on PS4. 
---
Ah, darn it- there goes my best excuse. I may have a duplicate soldier mask, but I def don’t have a full set or anything. Remind me in a couple days
---
I never played any BR before, i was very surprised with how much i enjoyed it. It was what i imagined survival mode was going to be.
---
https://www.downloadmoreram.com
---
It’s cool dude just wanted to see if you had any dupes no worries
---
You think that, and then use the legendary vs for and realize the staggering amount of lousy weapons there are. ;) 
---
But yeah, some new ones are always welcome, as long as I don’t find any more legendary rolling pins
---
Good idea, it could increase hunger/thirst in small amounts as well
---
Marine armor is not even close to the best.
---
780 hours on Destiny 2. Stopped playing in October. Been playing Fallout 76 ever since.
---
I have no problem killing downed players but when it’s 4v1 my priority isn’t finishing them off until I’m clear. I am usually gracious enough to give them a gift emote before I put one in their skull when their down. 
---
I agree with you that if I downed someone and someone else mopped him up while I wasn’t looking that’s my own fault and they should get the kill, but I don’t think the game even works that way either. I believe it works if I down a player on a team and someone from another team kills that downed player I still get the kill and If I down the second to last player on a team and someone else from another team kills the remaining player he gets that kill plus the downed one, even though he didn’t down him unfortunately. I would wonder if it’s the same say the firestorm downs the second to last player and you kill the last living player on that team if you would get a kill for that downed player from the firestorm/fall/NPC/etc..
---
Praise the Atom!
---
Beth games have had the same fall damage for 10 years....
---
One handled likely best for stealth melee. They have faster attack speeds allowing for more opportunities to sneak attack and certain weapons, like the combat knife, have a stealth blade attachment for 50% more sneak attack damage.
---
Hawking- 1 STR, 3 PER, 1 END, 6 CHR, 13 INT, 0 AGI, 2 LCK
---
A great way to not only kill a bunch of people, but also use strategically. Find a couple hazmat suits/power armor, launch a nuke and then use the radioactive fallout to hide and loot without worrying *too much* about other players coming in after you. If you’re lucky, the storm will force other players to come into the radiation fallout, giving you the advantage. Or, you get the advantage by looting lots of stims and chems.
---
It is awesome! But I think my explosive weapons have splash damage that antagonizes them.
---
most other players are chill.  This kind of thing is rare.
---
Hello, lv 158 rifleman main here.
---
There are a number of ways to build, all viable, dependent largely on what your playstyle is. You can be VATS or non-VATS, Bloodied or non- Bloodied, Explosive or non-Explosive, stealth or non-stealth. Many of these can be combined - I am a VATS Bloodied Explosive Stealth, for example.
---
I recommend playing around with a builder like this: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
If you want a specific build, let me know and I'll be happy to help out.
---
You can't have everything.
---
Trash attitude but good request.
---
Tray and snag a lever rifle aswell, imo they give the best fire power for lowest recoil.
---
I am with you on this. What FO76 need is multiplayer PvE contents that can be constantly replayed. Basically the PvE version of what they have done with nuclear winter, separate servers for PvE multiplayer contents. I don't see how else you can keep the game fun for high level players who have done everything.
---
The guy who took a dump on you accused you of being hater, but he didn't seem to realise he knocked on the game much harder than you did. He was knocking hard on the only "fun" PvE contents in the game. Without those events, all you have is bad PvP and grinding.
---
I highly doubt the NPC will add much value to the game. Probably just more single player quests that will last for an hour or two.
---
Yeah Jim Sterling tossed out a video the day after the E3 conference repeating all of the drama/problems around Fallout 76 for like 20ish minutes and only near the very end did he finally touch on anything current, i.e. mocking the Wastelanders update because Human NPCs/dialogue should've been a basic launch feature in his eyes.
---
Is anyone else having an issue where you cant re queue after finishing a game? First time starting I can find a game in about 10 seconds. After finishing and quitting back to the main menu, I try to queue again but I can never find a match. I've waited up to 10 minutes just to test it and I never find one.
---
Only solution I've found is re launching the game.
---
My experience: 2 min wait, 2 min lobby, 10 min clawling, 5 secs of shaking hands and i am dead
---
I'd play with my friends in a discord but they're all on PC #thanksBethesda
---
Wasn't trying to argue, just asking a question. No need to be hostile.  It's a bit impolite to make vague accusations and then try to mock and shut down anyone who asks a simple question. 
---
I clearly recall an interview with Todd, on the day the game was announced, when he said they'd be constantly improving the game, and it will even be a completely different game "a year after release, five years... ten years?"  That's quite the opposite of saying it's "complete and finished".
---
You should have all of them

Hard Bargain: 1 at least, but player vendors will probably have better deals.

Turn in unwanted Legendaries at Train station.
---
Well, I have a main with 15 strength that is useless and I keep getting the same perk cards over and over again, but I did get Iron Clad and Commando and I still get one shot. Its still a lot of fun though so try that; except for the duplicate cards part, dont do that..
---
I use vats/critical with a gauss rifle. This is usually what I run with. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1d147ff&amp;d=sb0p00pd2pk2pp2pl2e60c72ic4s11a71an2a32a04a51l71lt2lk2lu2lv2l10&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=
---
There's dozens of us. Dozens!
---
Oh God! Nooooo say it ain't so!
---
damn my heart goes out to ya big guy. i feel like one day it'll be a decent game tho, but by that time everyone will have probly abandoned it. adventure and survival mode already feels dead af. shoulda released this hot mess as early access.
---
This all works in conjunction with stealth multiplier. Unyielding and mutations can boost you AGI to 25+, literally invisible.
---
Poseidon energy plant is great. Clear the outside of the plant, break down or sell all the weapons the scorched drop.  If you want you could run a ‘powering up’ event. Then maybe even take the workshop and do the defend event. After that maybe branch out to the nearby Charleston landfill workshop and do that defend event. Try your luck getting the responder vendor bit to spawn. Once you’ve done all of that, maybe hop servers and repeat. A lot is in that nice tight area for lower levels until you’re ready for whitesprings
---
Im playing solo but having the same issue. Infinite queue after a match until I re launch. It's so frustrating, but I dont see many people talking about it. PC as well
---
Terrible game mode. Honestly fuck bethesda for falling for the obvious cash cow. They dont have vats and i cant even use my legendaries that i grinded so hard for.
---
Why thank you young man.
---
I found one of those recently and It told me a guy had stashed his loot and it give me a description of where. I followed it sure enough there was a metal crate inside of a tree stump. So they still exist they think they are just far and few between.  
---
Oddly enough it wasn't a quest it was just a note inside of a shack.
---
Yeah, I'd seen that you can only hold 7 cards. I was so excited because the card I had was for like 30% extra shotgun damage😞
---
I just saw this and I’m as giddy as a schoolgirl. I’m so stoked to see what improvements and additions they have in store for this mode as time goes on!
---
I see. Thanks for clearing it up 👍🏼
---
Sadly the power fist isn’t compatible with power armor.
---
we're talking about computer games in this thread, obviously consoles dont have keyboards or desks. and comparing to dead destiny and anthem isn't a good thing
---
Rock em’ sock em’ robots? Count me in
---
Hmm I could've sworn they gave you quest dots like the miscellaneous quests sometimes do. I guess I just haven't been picking up the right notes lately.
---
i just saw this thread and was about to give up when i saw the unmarked holotape on the small table by the big table in the middle of the room. when you pick it up the quest progresses.
---
They had a mod for this in FO4 and I loved it. Cigars, sunlight cigars, cigarets, crumpled cigs, wood/corn/metal pipes. Was awesome
---
Slightly unhappy about this, since the adventure servers have been less stable
---
I love my flamer to bits, but only pull it out once a week for, like, five minutes of flamey goodness before it's back to the fuel creation grind. Whole reason my CAMP has to be on an acid node now. So, yeah, more fuel'd be great.
---
I have yet to play a game of NW where any nukes are even launched!
---
We've all been there. Some areas were just not meant for lower levels. Enjoy the safer parts of the map until you figure out your build.
---
I had no issues with this one but it was during first week, possible it has gotten bugged with recent update. Try claiming a workshop and building it there.
---
Well the problem with that is too many would not be on equal footing if you used your legendaries.   Think of it this way... how many glass cannons are current pvp types that can 1 shot almost every character.  Does that make it right?
---
Yep it does nothing can transfer over
---
*"wait!! Before you shot ne down...pls let me listen to the holo first ok - it's thrilling!"*
---
I had the same problem for a long long time. Do daily’s and claim workshops and stuff. Keep going into Charleston and Grafton over and over to clear enemies. Basically you gotta grind exp to move the main story along sometimes.
---
Most just haven't played it and are just parroting what their favorite YouTuber or gaming journalist is telling them to think.  Just following the trends of the masses.
---
There are people who have played it and just don't "get it."  That's fine.  It's not for everyone.  At least they tried it and can articulate why they don't like it. The parrots, on the other hand, add nothing but noise to the conversation.
---
Bruh
---
Bet it’s because Sony’s too stubborn to agree with anything involving cross platform
---
Gives me that Gary 42 kinda feeling
---
Haha yeah, I would personally never wear stuff like that. Just to be clear I wasn't trying to be a jerk or have a go, just a personal preference thing.
---
No you can’t
---
I am talking about the PC versions obviously. 
---
I gave more examples.
---
I never understood the attention that guy got
---
You have to stack it with perks and mutations to get the most benefit.
---
I use 3☆ Nerd Rage, Adrenal Reaction mutation, and Bloodied explosive weapons.
---
At 19% health (52 out of 268 with well fed/hydrated), I do 750-800 base dmg with my lever action, depending on my perk loadout. 450-500 per shot with my handmade, and 1100 with a BP rifle.
---
I was thinking that if they did it as an "aid" item, it could be like Coyote Tobacco in FNV and add a perception bonus.
---
Move the camera 4 feet above your character and increase the field of view.
---
Yknow you could easily throw Lionel Richie into that fight and it would still be kind of in keeping. But maybe with a handicap like he spawn with out a weapon!
---
What platform are you on?  Someone might join you in game for a while and talk about whats giving you trouble.
---
Not at all uncommon to feel lost.  This game isn't as intuitive as it could be.  But to get good answers you may need to include a bit more info on the nature of the trouble.
---
I'm happy to help if I can.
---
If you're on PS4 I can help you out a bit.
---
Wait did you just say.... Instanced areas?
---
Rip, sorry for your loss lmao
---
Upvoted. Hope this gains traction
---
Too bad only you got the bonus XP for winning.
---
What? VATS, a mechanic rooted in the turn based nature of the original games doesn't make sense in a real-time FPS. It's almost like they took an established franchise with good game design and forced a games as a service implementation to close off user created content in place of lack luster MTX content. Luckily for fans, it doesn't take a big user base to keep these games afloat, just desperate gamers with deep pockets.
---
I guess after this and Anthem, hindsight is 20/20. The BR mode is a cherry on top. The idea of BR in Fallout was legitimately a bad joke, to make light of direction Fallout is going with 76.
---
I'd just have to chalk that up to lag.  Sometimes the blast radius is slow to update.
---
You know, there are some who would rather it be this way by default.  It would make the sirens a lot olmore terrifying, I'll give them that! X)
---
What platform
---
PSA on NW advance stealth tactics!
---
You haven't played it yet, did you?
---
Id rather participate in the making of the thing then wait a year for them to work it out in an office space. Just sayin
---
As someone who hated battle royales, I like this one for some reason. I literally can't explain why I'm just disposed more positively to this one, but whatever, it's free ~real estate~ XP
---
Regarding value, compare it to going to a movie.  $20 for a 2hr movie.  So if you pit in your 5hrs, you're already ahead.  Well, unless you bring a date to the movie....
---
I have a 15 str which doesnt affect carry weight or melee damage or even my ability to keep an SMG from firing at the sky after holding the trigger for a second. Hopefully they'll come out with some new perks for NW. 50 xp isn't worth a duplicate perk card imo, seems silly to me that there are 73 cards and I've gotten mostly duplicates.
---
But thats what distinguishes the new kids from the people who actually invest time into it. We spend hours and hours grinding and building ourperfecr setuo. Why throw all that out just to give new players a chance?
---
My problem is that I want to get the story, lore, perk cards, and some unlocks which are all locked behind NW levels. I end up going solo quite often unfortunately because instead of logically trying to survive the first couple rounds and gather supplies I'll always get that one guy.
---
The guy who will say something along the lines of "Stop being a *^$&amp;y let's go in and gun them down." to which they then proceed to run in, get caught in either a crossfire or are suddenly pinned down and then they're asking for help because they figured charging across open ground was a good idea. Sure you can try to kill to your hearts content but this isn't CoD, you gotta hang back sometimes, think and plan what you're going to do, most of all be patient and wait when it's a situation in which you DON'T need to move.
---
Also, why do people always shoot animal/ghoul spawns with their loudest weapon? The melee is there so you don't give away your position.
---
PSA:
---
Instead of telling them what they "should" be doing, why not try to articulate your request in a professional and respectful way that actually holds meaning to them. Maybe put a little more effort into developing the games experience other than posting comments about what you don't like or think should be done. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, stop expecting other to do it for you. However, your still free to wast your energy and time complaining to no one about nothing.
---
I’ve been stuck in a ring of Fire and burns burns burns a ring of fire
---
I a lot of weapons will require different perks for the different receivers
---
I'm not a huge fan of it but it still gets the job done
---
Damn it Karen... I don't care about the top 20 cakes that speak of satan...
---
People that had the luck to get good perk cards at low level have big advantages compared to others imo, this create an unbalanced competition
---
Im talking in the battle royale
---
Ha ha !! Perfect response
---
I don't suppose you've tried re-downloading the game?  I'm just pulling stuff out of the air here.
---
You might be rushing it a bit? You have lots of time, you're going to be struggling with that event, even in your 20's.
---
I haven't played Fallout with VATS ever... but I do play drunk a lot and PvE MOBs don't juke all of the damn time.
---
Definitely a 'yes' from me. I sometimes take my power armor OFF when I need the extra carry weight. The 120 increase is awesome for a packrat like myself. (That, and my whiskey stash with lvl3 Party Girl)
---
Dont all those food recipes give you some degree of rads anyway? Presumably from the water?
---
People think Melee is useless when it's actually the best weapon next to the crossbow for taking out npc animal/ghoul spawns so you don't give your position away. I see so many people open fire on one Mutant Hound when three people attacking it with a melee weapon at once could bring it down easily while not letting the enemy hear where they are.
---
Find some people to help you people in this game are really nice
---
that's a tough fight at that level but try explosives.  if you are stealth you can creep up to spawn it but fall back before you engage.  Throw a few grenades at it and maybe toss down a couple mines out in front of you a ways so it hits those as it charges in.  
---
Mop up with a shotgun to the face with a banked critical in vats.
---
The basic backpack is definitely worth it and really only a minor pain in terms of quests. To get any of the mods, such as increasing from 60 to 120, adding DR, insulation so perishables last longer etc require possum badges— unlike the 3 tadpole badges you need to get the backpack in the first place. 
---
The possum badges are a grind. You need at least 5 and really 8 for the coolest mods. At least three of the quests are broken and can’t be completed —- I’ve never see 5 death claw hides anyway.
---
Yes I’m on PS4 my username is El_Gibbss
---
This.
---
ash heap and toxic valley will spawn enemies at your level.  explore those regions, get all the map pins, kill all the things.
---
annnnnnd noted.
---
I'm on PS4 and have not had that problem yet. It does give me a server disconnect error after every match but I'm able to Q up again right away.
---
And valuantly did thee go forthe,
---
Through atomic fire and raining led;
---
Thy three-shot crossbow at thine side, 
---
An engineere's armoure protecting thine head
---
The charging shotgun barrel doesn't add WeaponTypeShotgun, and should therefore benefit from Rifleman rather than Shotgun perks, plus all other perks that affect rifles. If you have results that suggest otherwise then you should describe them.
---
Automatic receiver should use Commando perks, as it adds WeaponTypeAutomatic.
---
Hey sorry I took so long to reply, I won't be able to tonight I'm still over encumbered
---
OP posted that hellfire's a universal skin, so in theory you should be able to use it in Nuclear Winter too.
---
PS4!
---
Agility is easy he says.  Its fast he says. HA! Not for this 50 year old.  After 40? Fails I had my 12 year old son do it.  Twerp did it on the 4tg try lol.
---
I probably won’t be using vats too much, and I’m a big fan of the homemade rifle and the .50 hunting rifle. As for bloodied or non, I would like to give bloodied a try and see how it goes, and explosives are always a yes lol
---
I don’t know that I’ve even seen a gauss rifle in this game yet
---
Well that maybe an option down the road.  Hardcore people like yourself can go head it head while others get the proper battle royale experience of starting with nothing.
---
Hey, I like this idea!
---
Kind of a mix of the two, almost like a sniper that can do a good deal of damage that can also get into the mix with a semi auto homemade if needed.
---
Just found out Tank killer  requires 6. Are you 100% with the other two?
---
Multi-Scorchbeast battles are some of the most fun things in the game when you're high-level.  I think the most I've ever dealt with at the same time is 3 or 4.
---
You can get a shitload of caps in Welch
---
Will do ! Thanks so much
---
Frog Legs and Shotguns, my man
---
Got it !
---
Add me bradatar I’m EST
---
Canvas bag backpack skin.
---
Wink ;)
---
Gottcha, any good places to power level ?
---
Most people didn't like it because it wasn't Fallout 5 with co-op... but it wasn't supposed to be. 
---
If you like the game from playing the trial then you'll keep liking it from here on out probably. Feels like it's going to just keep getting better to me.
---
Hi sorry I took so long replying, nice I have fairly strong base defences so if you want I can build them for you, after I've sold enough stuff that I can fast travel again do you want to search together?
---
Bring the robot workbench back, the model is already in the game soo...
---
What is this "server crash" thing? I've played for many hours with no server crash. Yet there are innumerable posts about server crash? Is it isolated to certain platforms? I am on PC. Have a decent system. Have a fast, stable internet connection. Never had a server crash, game crash, or anything like that.
---
I installed that mod once and it crashed my Xbox like a Brotherhood vertibird. I couldn't even *play* Fallout 4 until I rummaged through my files and all my FO4 data.
---
I'm 42 or something. Way to low for the hours I pourd into the game :). One beast is enough for me. And my ammo crate.
---
Not UESP quality, but there are a couple out there.  Videos as well.  And a Perks planner.
---
Probably atom shop
---
Played once, was the reason my team lost. The other team had power armor. We did not. Fun. Sounds so fun to wait on the game to load up and actually play and then die in 1/5th the time.  I've things to do.
---
We love interacting with this community :) Keep all the awesome feedback and stories coming!
---
That was/is an atom shop item, but I have no idea if you can still buy it.
---
Darn you can’t anymore
---
I just bought a Rival 310. So much better than office mouse.
---
I like that idea
---
We need country roads
---
Then what is. Tell me that instead of saying what’s close or not, lol.
---
We are here to help :)
---
I have seen people with camo fatigue under armor in NW but not sure how they get it
---
Thank you Elon. Looking forward to your new Tesla models
---
Yeah! For sure.
---
My team never listens to me even thought there new to the game and I’ve been playing since beta and know the map
---
The intro sounds like the Walking Dead to me.
---
Wendigo Cave is no place for a Level 16. X)
---
Yep. Last item on the list...maybe I need to add dry kindling lol
---
Oh really? I’ve seen 3 so far lol.
---
Yeah I honestly figured we would get genetic NPC Raiders/Settlers traveling around/setting up shop etc. I hope that happens though because I'd love to fight generic Raiders over Grafton Dam or Sutton etc.
---
I’m not against it at all. Just curious on everyone’s thoughts.
---
It was a limited time Atom Shop item but sometimes they bring popular items back so you never know
---
Cool
---
Make your build before you level up
---
So I can scout outside from inside with it?
---
You make an interesting point in how guns don't remove themselves when they are out of ammo, but various resources do.  It would be nice if the option just dimmed out.
---
Normally it doesn't do much to shotguns either, because damage from multiple projectiles is combined before the damage formula is applied.
---
Generally the problem with boosting damage resistance is that the effect is relative to the previous value. For example, increasing DR from 50 to 100 has the same percentage effect on damage taken (22%) as increasing DR from 100 to 200, or 200 to 400. If you already have high DR, the value of DR-boosting perks is very low.
---
Thank you ! But for starters I prefer explore solo :) Today I only saw nice players :)
---
He is likely in team chat and you are in area chat or something similar. Try making a party or make sure the audio is set to auto or team
---
Now that’s prejudiced. We all float down here.
---
Yeah, sometimes the in game team chat is terrible and just randomly fails. A separate party is far more stable. Don’t know if this is a bug or what.
---
We tried team, auto, and area. None of which are working.
---
Its one of the harder missions. I remember dying twice, gave up and came back 10 levels later.
---
I had to build one, log out from the server, log back in, scrap it and build a new one and that worked for me.
---
Try and get a full set of raider power armor from underneath gorge bridge. Then, spam grenades or missiles until it dies. I had a high level friend with me, so i cant prove my strategy. Just know that killing a wendigo as a stealth build would be.. Hard
---
Still looks like shit.
---
What are some good places to farm XP ?
---
i've been just watching this  guy stream, just out of curiosity, boy did his constant bunnyhop kill my mood for nw, don't think i'm going to touch it for a while
---
Jokes on you suckazzz, I just won a round!
---
I was able to get 1000
---
I always loved Heartaches by the Number from FNV. More music would be great!
---
So not very good at Battle Royals...Through like 10-15 games I've gotten like 2 kills total. Any tips? D:
---
Yeah you can pretty much replace any image in the game on PC. Even the original load screens.
---
😅 yeah it’s not going so well lol 
---
But I’ll totally check out that spot for the Armour ! Thanks so much.
---
Do some events and side quests in the meanwhile. Take a few workshops etc. You dont want to go farming around whitesprings yet ;)
---
I don't like that tobacco products are basically worthless in FO76.  It seems so politically correct, like "we don't want to encourage smoking."  Come on, it's a post-apocalyptic fantasy.  Everyone would be smoking like chimneys if they could!
---
Yeah. You could hide in a building and go into photomode and watch the entire perimeter of the building without ever being at risk. Which is quite a problem if people are doing teams with mics like OP.
---
Are you on xbox? I had to change my security settings for my mic to work.
---
Have up or tried around full dufflebags.. ya gonna trip.. I hate the little sticks and rocks that i get stuck on all the damn time.. still getting an upvote though
---
If you can make MIRV grenades, throwing one or two should erase it, if not cripple it. If you can cripple a leg first, Wendigos are no more dangerous than a crippled deathclaw. They limp slowly towards you, and you can simply back-pedal from them without any real risk.
---
Having a perk that gives you instant-cripple chance for certain weapons is very valuable for certain fights.
---
Since there is no real endgame i wouldn't recommend "power level"... Just don't rush it and try to enjoy it.
---
It's not the destination, it's the way that matters.
---
They've increased the variety of things that can pop up at random encounter locations (like adding the lemonade vendor for example), so the odds of finding the one with a note are much smaller.
---
No such thing as meta NW build, it's been deliberately designed to avoid that sort of thing. That said, having a minigun works pretty well.
---
The photomode thing is dirty.... but since anybody can do it and it leaves you vulnerable it's not too bad. Still... probably should lock it out because it's the most overpowered "perk" you have.
---
We are. What did you have to change exactly?
---
And Skyrim on them?
---
&gt;ash heap and toxic valley will spawn enemies at your level. explore those regions, get all the map pins, kill all the things.
---
Also claim all the workshops, do all the events, and kill all the things.
---
Oh awesome thanks so much !
---
I always kill prize bot on sight. I don't approve of him sneaking up on me.
---
Insult bot on the other hand is my dude. One time he just appeared from thin air when I was sitting on the couch in my camp and he insulted me and then vanished the same way he came. It was hilarious
---
Just to annoy everyone here, you can find a brotherhood recon rifle in a fuse box, next to the door of alleghany asylum. If you arent looking for one like that, then do take some of the offers in the comments here.
---
People abuse hard drugs all the time. I'm a habitual abuser of Psychotats and Med-X.
---
I did. Metal has the highest damage reduction but lowest energy, but the grounded mutation adds 100 energy resistance so it makes up for it. BOS combat armor has very good damage and energy reduction. Leather has very high energy reduction but low damage reduction. Other types are somewhere in the middle but some of them have rad protection as well.
---
You can combine pieces to get very solid all around defense, but again, for damage reduction metal is best.
---
It's so fun, I get so confidant when I fin a Grognak Axe at this point since this mode has almost exclusively given me melee perks. Ran up to two people in power armor with .50 cals and one shot both of them last night, it was awesome.
---
Whats your perk card load outs...that helps
---
So it’s like freecaming
---
I just love how the entire idea is to find the best single person for the job of overseer. but lets throw it into teams of 4 because fuck solo players.
---
if they did that , you wouldn't be able to do things like pose with a body of a killed creature or a take a pic with your buddies and if it was only for nw at that point they can just remove it
---
What system?
---
My gamertag is publictiara6995. I will look for you.
---
Map knowledge is good, ive also played since beta and know the map area pretty well, in fact my camp is outside Sutton so i know the NW area very well but ive noticed a good gaming headset gives you the best advantage. I can call out direction and distance based off of how much ive played adventure mode.
---
Heh, nothing personnel, kid
---
Wait, you do learn stuff from scrapping armor?
---
Thats the little kids down voting you. What Todd did was go away from what the core of fallout is just to get more people. If they fixed the problems in the REAL mode. Yeah I said real..they would have more people come back to the game. This genre of game doesn't need a stupid take on Fortnite or Pub, or w.e...go with your base man..not these kids that will play for 6 months an put it down for the next game that copied fortnite..
---
I just wish they'd make it easier to hear that its time to set your starting location.  I'm stuck for 2 minutes waiting for that screen to come up, and my choices are either run around punching people for no reason or doing something else (clean, read reddit, etc).  I usually choose something else, and often don't look up in time to see the map is up.  A nice loud chime would be really nice.
---
Loving the downvotes from folks that don’t understand sarcasm
---
Maria Chavez would be proud.
---
Appalachia needs more of your kind. Have an upvote for being a good and brave sport.
---
Is it bad that I now want to RP as a blind Lionel Ritchie in 76?
---
I wasn't sure till I got it... but yeah it's game changing being able to carry the extra weight. For me it pretty much doubled my time between having to dump loot at camp/vendors.
---
Me to but they think they can do it by themselves one person might listen but that’s it
---
My gander at is publictiara6995. I will look for you.
---
I’m loving the downvotes from the people that don’t get sarcasm, hah
---
If you're running melee you can also equip radicool for another +5 strength if you're radiated.
---
My gamertag. Stupid autocorrect. Lol
---
Also worth pointing out that if you see something that violates subreddit rules, reporting brings it to the mods attention.
---
I report the occasional "Bethesda Plz" post and the mods really do go in and nuke those rather quickly.
---
It serves no purpose in any game. It ruins those games as well
---
Did you walk up to and activate it?
---
Yea i liked br mode but im not crazy about br and im kinda tired of it but still wanna grind my overseer xp so hopefully they add deathmatch
---
Unfortunately adventure mode is full of bunnies atm and the legendary spawns feel massively nerfed after the patch.
---
Right? The game mode speced me for melee and now I'm tempted to respec my heavy gunner into melee for regular play as well.
---
No, I think I could’ve  though
---
It’s just the daily challenges and also it’s in Beta there will be glitches
---
With that mission it was the damn Mirelurk Kings in there that drove me nuts!
---
Try reversing the headsets to see if the issue is the game or headphones
---
Best case scenario for me would be to have 3-5 voiced robot companions to choose from, and being able to customize them like you could in automatron. This would highly incentivize me to get on another recipe/blueprint grind, similarly to the brewing stuff. (Though I think this would have a lot more lasting power.)
---
I also love adding new types of workstations in my C.A.M.P. so this would fill my need for that
---
I've actually gotten okay traffic, nothing to complain about, but I almost never see anyone. Neither in person or when I look at the map. Usually a cluster or 2-3 people around the vault / new areas, then a random 20ish person here or there, and that's it.
---
It does. But how often does that come in play? If anything, that stat would really be helpful on a team because you could share any perk.
---
It also boosts the buy and sell rate for npc vendors.
---
If it were me, and I don't mean to provide input when it isn't asked for, I'd put some points to strength to get the ballistic ammo perk and the one that reduces Chem and stimpack weight.
---
I hope they bring back Fisto
---
How much difference does explosive make? I’ve been using 1*, When you say base dmg , do you mean Pip-Boy reading?
---
Run as many events as you can. Power leveling isn't as easy as it used to be, unless you can talk a 100+ into letting you tag while they're farming.
---
Don’t even get me started on the stupid crabs lol
---
food as well
---
Aren’t all games cash grabs from a business sense? Never understood that argument.
---
"BR is trendy and people wanted to try it." That's Literally the definition on "jumping on the bandwagon". Same thing as me saying "man those Patriots sure are popular this year, I think I'll support them because of that"
---
It also shows how awful controls and ui are for pvp and br.  On console it’s a nightmare trying to loot or use items and not get destroyed
---
I have seen some people posting pictures

I haven’t had any problems with the legendary’s yet
---
The little high schoolers keep down voting people who make perfect sense...man I agree with you they need to stick to their base, people who have been loyal to fallout since fallout 1 or w.e. The only thing I see from poopular winter is that they sre now going to concentrate on this crap an not the REAL balls of the game adventure an survival...thats what got the games off the shelves, not this bullshit mode that just unloaded a shit ton more bugs that will take them another 9 months to finally getting around to start thinking about getting a group together to figure out when they could possibly get an idea of when they are going to start addressing the issues of the real game. An for the little kids that last statement is worded an a runon for a reason
---
That's fine, I'll just get on NW
---
Yeah it’s much quieter.  What system are you on?
---
Nailed it! Only I think he would drop CHR to 1 and add 2 to INT and 3 to PER. MAYBE drop luck to 1 as well because he kind of got the shit end of the stick!
---

The key to the room the armour is in under the bridge, is on top of the rollercoaster in the big park next to ash heap. Its called west bridge key i think
---
Lmfaooooo,
---
we have exactly zero info about the prestige system.  
---
I doubt you will be able to use lvl 50 items at lvl 1 though.  Best I'm hoping for is we keep our stash contents and known recipes/plans so we can craft decent gear as we level back up.
---
Many people don't have a brain, they let their favorite youtubers and gnn hosts think for them.
---
Yes the game has improved greatly, but there are still bugs. Bethesda is very active in the community and listening to player feedback.
---
Yeah teamwork is definitely a big key to NW. I played a round where i was told not to over extend and i didnt listen. Got gunned down within seconds and gave away my teams location when they tried to help me.
---
I was close too ..then a scorchbeast attacked ...
---
I saw one last night so no
---
Oh awesome thanks sm
---
Yes!!!!
---
Nice to hear, im also about to go work here in a bit. But if ever you need help just let me know.
---
Sorry. I can't decide for you.
---
Is your ign Colonel Klink?
---
You lose all the flavor with purified water. It's just like real life: purified water for drinking, dirty irradiated water for cooking.
---
Kind of wondering how useful paper armour is though...
---
If you didn't know, activating it makes it so there's an explosion around it and some cool dramatic music playing briefly
---
That’s awesome
---
I think 76 has a great deal of potential. Following the basic MMO format they could continue to build on it for years making constant tweaks and improvements, adding new content in the form of stories, weapons, characters, game modes. I mean look at what ZOS was able to do with ESO. That was more than hot garbage at launch and now it’s an easy to play difficult to master rich and full MMO. I have faith in 76 to get better.
---
Not a perfect solution but I just searched fallout playlist on spotify for ps4. And it plays 400ish fallout songs. Good workaround.
---
I feel the same way.. I love taking out new people and having them pop a leader bobble head while sharing inspiration.. gets them up in level fast and they can start exploring the world!
---
Put yourself on a scrap diet now and don't get "addicted" to the carry weight perks... in fact, don't use them at all and you'll be better off in the long run!
---
Wheres my johny guitar and big iron huh beth

I love the thrill of it myself - never know if I've got the area for myself or if I'm going to be deep in enemy lines.
---
He's a vocal critic against scummy business practices and was one of the big voices against lockboxes in games for example.  But he likes to go balls deep into his criticism to where it becomes more blind outrage/negativity more than anything.
---
You can't boil "Toxic Water", unless they changed that very recently... I had my camp in Toxic Valley for 4 months, that was one of the drawbacks, couldn't get "dirty water" nearby to boil
---
Yes the backpack is always visible while equipped unless you're wearing an outfit that has an existing backpack (at least that's what the patch 9 notes say) and then it's equipped but not visible. It's auto-unequipped while in power armor and is not visible.
---
It uses your AP tho so if its drained or you have a low amount it will pull it down fast. But it's an intricate part of the game. Not NW...adventure an survival...thats the real game
---
My bad, misread.
---
You sure? There's something like 180 years difference in the years if you Google when the games actually take place. 2104 and 2287. I don't remember for positive but I think that's right.
---
Tried that too. Same issue. His headset worked for me but mine wouldn’t work for him.
---
Do you hit max scrip every day? I went from getting 150 scrip in less than 2 hours, plus storing enough items to get half my scrip limit for the next day, to taking 3+ hours to get under 100 scrip. I can do multiple Whitespring/Westek/Burrows runs with one or zero legendaries to show for it. That literally never happened to me before and now it's every server. It's night and day for me after the patch.
---
Yeah I really want to unlock the lore in Vault 51, the new skins are a nice bonus, so I’m trying to grind. Might be going a little too hard but lvl 100 is a ways off
---
Heavy weapons are top tier
---
"I'm a pretty low level"
---
I found the problem. 🙃 Great job adventuring out there - death or not.
---
Or just have certain terminals set up to play them automatically. They don’t have stuff on all the computers. Or add a second computer lab
---
Maybe they're roll playing as a person who teabags in the post apocalypse.
---
Most likely something on your end rather than the game itself
---
There could definitely be a few more, like 'sorry', 'thank you', 'you're welcome', 'no problem', 'no thanks'. People want to trade all the time, I don't think thumb down or wave are exactly appropriate.
---
So far i gotten rank 16 just by doing this method so far I near something like 300 exp or more depends
---
Yeah same. He’s just annoying and whiny to me. Not to mention I don’t agree with like, any of his reviews
---
I hit install and it finished in a second and now I'm back in game. Maybe bethesda launcher taking a shit?
---
Yeah the other two are just good hiding tactics. The photomode thing needs to be fixed somehow.
---
Nah, I’m good with it.
---
Everyone that plays in battle royale only use black characters?
---
Certainly worth the $17 on Amazon and Wal-Mart. Console has a $17 option that has some swag with it too on walmart
---
i am on PC after the last patch the servers have been crashing on me quite frequently once an hour and sometime right after i get loaded in. so ya its a thing again, most likely due to the Free players and higher volume of players. I guess i'll down vote myself now.
---
They need to address the XP you receive when killing someone. I have more incentive to just hid and build with kits than just kill people.
---
Damn that's good
---
It's just not needed in a co-dependent time elimination match. Obviously both for exploits and wasting time as other people make an effort to focus on staying alive.
---
I really just want the hellfire but since thats at lvl 100 its just gives me a headache thinking about it because I gotta que up play a 30 min match with 3 randoms make sure I get the kills and last till im the 2nd team left at least to get xp as for a death match maybe 10 min and im killing lots of people for xp
---
I'd like to know as well, I do the Iron Clad and Marine Armor thing also and still go down in one or two shots. Ive been shot through walls or hundreds of meters away hiding in the bushes. Takes me a whole clip from my SMG to take someone down and that is with Commando. So I dunno. I still have a lot of fun though, I just don't expect to get any kills unless Im using a grenade launcher or handmade anymore lol
---
It’s not jumping on the bandwagon, because the BR in this game isn’t even remotely that popular. You could make that argument with fortnite maybe, but Fallout BR? Yeah ok buddy lmfao
---
Same! 3 runs thru white springs and zero legendaries. I'd take my junkies pool cue drops back but it's been nerfed so badly. I get not making it so easy to get scrip, but maybe up legendary spawns in other places on the map for balance or something.
---
I’m not letting a level hold me back, though a scorch beast might
---
got my first win last night, gained 4 levels for my character so far. definitely a good decision by the developers to keep NW in the game.
---
Adding effects to existing gear sounds way more interesting than rolling for more random shit gear.  I like this idea way better than "no legendaries" in the first place.
---
I want my own Moo Moo!
---
Yea, I usually stay away from wandering the bog. I’m pretty high lvl, so it won’t kill me unless I get swarmed. Like last week but the 10 mirelurk kings. But the issue is it’s a very resource sapping area. Within 15 minutes you could be down 1/2 your stims, thousands of rounds of multiple ammo and really get nothing for it. 
---
Got jumped by 3 SB’s, down 500 ultracite 5.56 and 3 plasma cores. Weapons busted, armor needs repair, aaaannndddd...... I got some meat and bones. Great.
---
They were keeping it all along. Y’all are being manipulated
---
It's not so much the xp you get from the actual quest as it is the xp you get from gathering the materials. Whether it be killing mole miners for black titanium or capturing workshops for it, you'll get xp while working towards it.
---
I genuinely would 100% rather they remove some of the freedom if it means we can have NPCs in the open world. This just sounds disappointing.
---
Ideally they'd be doing it like WoW. Where they can instance the NPCs themselves so that someone can kill a guy but someone else will see the guy still alive if they haven't. But both players can also see eachother. But it seems impossible with this game/engine.
---
I honestly wouldn't mind if they just made them essential. From the way it sounds here, all NPCs are just going to be "indoors" through a loading screen where each player has their own version of the town. Which just feels disconnected and pointless. 
---
I'd much rather they have NPCs in the main world. I thought we'd be getting human raiders to fight, humans at train stations, roaming the map etc.
---
Unfortunately, they can't really do that since then they would have to change the code for consoles to be different from ours since they have less buttons to work with. In FO4 there was a hotkeys mod so people could keep those things separate but we're stuck with what Bethesda gives us for FO76.
---
Legendary players?
---
It occasionally fails to recognize the game files. Clicking install and navigating to the same directory will recheck files. I have it happen every couple of weeks for whatever reason.
---
Make sure you have enough room to install or the launcher won't even recheck. Which is idocy.
---
didnt have any issues reading it man, was truly enjoyable read.
---
Meh, lone wanderer for life!
---
Odd. Thanks tho. Also why am I getting downvoted for this? Seriously dont understand that mentality of whoever's doing it lol.
---
Yeah I remember I got the food plant working and as soon as I did that I crashed
---
Sorry I would if I wasn’t on PS4
---
Let The Children Who Likes Getting Swindeled by Bugthesda and it's lies.
---
Also about who gets non-duplicate cards
---
The light metal plans are common world spawns in the Forest and Toxic Valley. I can dig up some locations if you're desperate, but usually people find plenty of them while exploring.
---
Medium &amp; heavy metal plans are rare quest rewards, at best. Probably Toxic Valley, Ash Heap and Savage Divide. Generally you don't bother with them because you only need the light arms plan to unlock all the mods, and after level 50 you only wear legendaries.
---
I make it a point to teabag anyone I kill. That fact that it gets people like you all up in arms, just tickles me to death.
---
"Humans" seems an apt enough explanation for that.
---
There are a lot, I repeat, a lot of great people out in the wastelands! It’s gotten a lot better as well! My gt is SaltClaw on Xbox if you need anything... glad to assist!
---
how about the dupe card is replaced by an XP booster? it would give you a consumable that can be used in vault 51, next 5 matches give bonus XP inbetween 1.5X or even up to 2X
---
Buy it or don’t. Responses to a tldnr whiney post shouldn’t sway you one way or another
---
You sure your not referring to people blocked for a session?  He says he’s not finding it
---
All this sounds like good news for the game. I think over time they will add different type of companions like humanoid, robot, and animals or at least I hope they do.
---
Yea. That's a good enough explanation lol. Thanks anyway! Back to brewin some nuka shine
---
I try the same, I have noticed that leveling is getting extremely harder now that I hit lvl 30 and I’m afraid of what the grind might be at when we are in the 80s
---
Hard bargain still helps when selling to max out your caps with the vendors.
---
Who was crying?  Ease up on the hatorade, dude.
---
Very good points. Dont know why these little kids keep down voting good comments...haters
---
T-51 has the best ballistic, but only by a bit.
---
I would not count on keeping it
---
Hahaha! Hells yeah it would be terrifying!
---
I sure would like to see Stevie and Ray high fiving.
---
Good call! Many don’t know that about the locks or about Pacifist turning off after level 5 or worse when they team up and one has it off which gets everyone in trouble!
---
When i did have a human npc i was chose nick valentine or strong cause they were most likeable lol
---
Thanks anyway
---
Once I got Automatron all my human companions lived in The Castle, Dogmeat became synth Shaun's guard dog while I was out protecting the wasteland.
---
That's some really solid advice right there. I can't seem to shake true hiker and traveling pharm. They really got me
---
Yeah. They can jack the scrip prices up as high as they want.
---
Something like rolling for the first star as many times as you want, but once you roll the second star it locks the first star and increases cost. Anything to make an equipment crafting character have some use beyond level 45-50.
---
At level 5 it automatically turns off per Bethesda and the screen once you leveled up should have said this in your card pack. 
---
It requires the player to manually go into the settings and turn it back on.
---
Ada was just so supportive. She was the only companion that seemed excited to carry arpund all of the typewriters and desk fans I kept snagging.
---
I didn’t even attempt the Wendigo cave till I was lvl 40ish. Spend some time in whitesprings levelling up. Better weapons/armor. Whitesprings is good as there’s always other players around that will help you if you get too deep. Worst case, the bots will protect you while you run inside.
---
I've seen this idea before and would definitely like to see it implemented. Finally all the turrets and locked doors will actually serve a purpose (other than NPCs), it will add risk and reward other than PvP, and you will have to be more methodical in managing your inventory. 
---
I wonder, would you have it so other people can see what is stored inside *before* picking the lock, or have it so it just says "Locked", and they would have to decide whether or not to take the risk? 
---
As soon as they pick the lock, whether it was worth it or not, they now have a bounty on their head and your turrets going nuts on them. My only concern is: the punishment for picking a lock is so small - like a bounty of 50 caps. Would people not go from camp to camp looting these boxes knowing that the punishment is merely a slap on the wrist? After all, the loot you get from these boxes, whether it's legendary items or nothing special, would sell for and make up for the small punishment, meaning ultimately the thieves are *always* going to make a profit from doing so. Maybe increasing the punishment for stealing might fix this though.
---
You have to find a dead tourist who will have a broken camera. Collect the camera and fix it then finish the quest
---
You’re playing a public game with the ability to save/share gameplay - so how can it be considered witch hunting when the person cheating is doing it blatantly  out in the open ??  Cmon people. It’s usernames in video games not real life name / people hunting.
---
Have you visited player vendors?
---
Polished heavy metal
---
The radium definitely needs a buff. Such a wasted opportunity. It should at least easily match Tommy gun or even the combat rifle in ballistic damage, then with the addition of radiation damage it should outclass all. 45 weapons.
---
The explosive perk on weapons adds 25% more to base weapon dmg. At 5☆, Demo adds an additional 60% of the 25% explosive damage, so about 15% more damage total on top of the explosive perk. 
---
I run 10 INT, so 3☆ nerd, 4☆ gunsmith, and 3☆ demo. Each star of demolition expert gives me around 21 dmg each ☆.
---
Sorry, I am referring to the dmg displayed in the pip boy when I said "base dmg". It's the total dmg unmodified by sneak/crits.
---
I would if you were PS4..... sorry
---
Lmao. Yeah, I'm hung up on getting rid of those two as well, but I have ditched all the others finally!
---
Links broken?
---
It's possible some of the photo quests are bugged...do you have the tourist camera? I found the archery and hunters quests to be pretty easy to accomplish.
---
Oh my gosh thanks so much!  Any sure fire places where these guys spawn?
---
Maybe get rid of Survival mode and keep BR.  Let's face it, survival mode is kind of pointless now.
---
Would he have agi though?
---
Yeah I'm trying to repair it
---
My brother has too do that after every game but me and my friend are perfectly fine. Kinda annoying
---
It is pretty much a single player. Since we cant be killed now in pacifist mode
---
Oh my gosh thanks so much! Any sure fire locations where these guys can be found?
---
Bobble heads are an aid item, they should say what they do when you look at them.
---
For instance the lock smith bobble head gives you unbreakable Bobby pins for an hour, there are gun and melee one's also.
---
I think their is about 10 altogether.
---
Same as the magazine's that you find around the place
---
you're probably a virgin tho, so its okay for you to do it since its all the action you can get.
---
Does anybody even lock their C.A.M.P. anymore? As long as people shut the door behind them, that's what really counts.
---
Yeah ounce I was in a team with a level 3 a level 6 and a level 14 overseer rank I was telling them what I thought would work level 14 and 6 disagreed and went of the level 14 died first then the level 6 at the end me and the level 3 won that round
---
Yea it seems like a really bad climb that needs to be adjusted. I get that all the unlocks are only cosmetic but still I want that fiery rebar damnit.
---
Turns out they’re going back to the FO3 dialog system. Can’t find the link on mobile but I read it a few days ago.
---
For the most part it is that way! Only workshops or the player turning Pacifist off will put you into PvP. 
---
Workshops... personally I think they are a huge waste of time. The amount you get even at the largest ones over say an hour, can easily be collected is 1/3 the time and won’t put you into PvP. 
---
At low level you could farm Flatwoods and robots and WV Lumber and get so much material and caps it isn’t funny! They’re all low level and you get xp to level up! Win win!
---
It’s random when they spawn. I found my dead tourist at the teapot
---
Excellent thanks so much for your help!
---
Actually I'm happily married but thanks for your concern. You should be more worried about the next time I'm gonna teabag you in game. Get mad
---
Ohhhh ok, I see now. Yea I wonder how long that's gonna last.
---
Didn't even know that was a thing :P
---
I haven't even tried this yet. 
---
Last time I played regularly *(Like January or Febuary)*, it seemed like nothing but backlash at Bethesda and just about everyone quitting.
---
Also Wavy Willard’s, battlefield cemetery. You might have to server hop to find it
---
Scrap. Always scrap common weapons because you'll learn mods from it
---
Scrap them get the mods from scrapping and build a nice lower level weapon
---
A mix; polished dense heavy metal chest, or BOS dense heavy combat, and heavy studded leather limbs gives best all around DR/ER.
---
Is there a complete list of its mods out there? I have seen bunch of mods at vendor bots from time to time, but never saw large mag or powerful auto receiver.
---
That's a lot of special points in perception to run a  full commando/rifleman build concurrently. You could use 6 perception with 1 level of each commando and rifleman but if you want to max a build out, I suggest you pick one or the other.
---
I server hop for literally everything else so might as well!
---
It's a Soviet Union style dragon cult: Join or Die. The one detail you're forgetting is the inevitable calcification of the infected
---
Although i will say that since the original plan was for the mode to be only out a week they dont want use climbing to fast because really if you hit 100 how are you gonna use the hellfire paint if theres hellfire armor yet
---
If you plan to use a build that revolves around power armor like to use the Stabalized perk for Heavy Weapons, then no.
---
If you don't plan to ever use power armor, have at it! It's increased carry capacity that can be upgraded and have its appearance changed.
---
Perfect thanks sm for the advice
---
Battle Royal is garbage, if you play it legit. You just get killed by someone under the map and honestly, if you want to play a Battle Royal game there are others and fallout did not need a mode for it. It's be nice if they decided to smooth out what they had instead of cashing in on the dead craze
---
How about it just lets us trade 3 or 4 duplicates for achance at a new one?
---
That ring you bought for mama murmghr?
---
Look for the camp icons with green rings around them
---
Fox companion.
---
it's based off of your weapon's base damage and afaik it doesn't benefit from sneak attack multiplier. so if you are using a sneak build, vats crit doesn't do much
---
Well, the other ingredients are slightly radioactive, too, but I'm talking about the rads from COLLECTING water... in quantity. 
---
The hand pump is painfully slow (I havent tried the drink-first-then-collect thing), but if I go on a run to the nearest pond, I get half-irradiated collecting enough to make the trip worthwhile.
---
I suppose it won't matter once I can build a decontamination shower. A regular non-purifying pump would be a reasonable solution, but it still doesn't make IN-WORLD sense to me that we wouldn't be able to make soup or juice out of arguably BETTER water.
---
I figured they probably misread "Toxic Water" as "Dirty Water."
---
I assume it's safe to dump the toxic water based on what you said.
---
I do the same, I like to pretend that since my dweller has spent so much time outside the vault they now have hellish PTSD nightmares
---
Guess we are in the same boat. My plan is to slowly drop this perks to level 2 and see how that does.
---
Meh.
---
Just server hop, some servers are still full of players and boss events.
---
i bet a lot of people do it for the small chance they will be doing it to someone who cares at ALL.  and they enjoy it, in a complicated, strange way.
---
Go after muties for 5.56 - best place for lead is Lucky Mine, just be sure to use excavator armor if you've got it to multiply your gains 😁
---
Yes!!! I either say “sweet all the loot for me and my team!” Or “ok as soon as I spawn run east/north/south/west. You’ll find a weapons somewhere. Survive!!”
---
To your first question: I think they should make the bounty as high as the items you stole. So for example if you steal a 10mm pistol, you'll get a bounty of 20 caps but if you steal a legendary torso armor, you would get a bounty of 100 caps or something. Maybe they should add then aswell that when it's a stolen item, you can sell it for max 50% of the value, so that stealing is only valuable for yourself.
---
Regarding the level 25 vs a level 110: Is there much to loot from a level 25 for a level 110? Maybe all the junk but that's such a small weight that you can get it in your safe stash without problems
---
Get off the damn fence and get in here!
---
Whelp, time to get grinding
---
You know funny, I hate ESO. I was in the closed beta for it and found it to be an abysmal representation of what an Elder Scrolls game should be, during its last free weekend I also found myself rehashing the exact same issues I had with it during closed beta. It felt like someone took TES lore and setting and then made a game around it with little to no knowledge of TES games. 76 at least kinda feels kinda like a Fallout game, enough anyway that I'm not screaming at it for fucking everything up from the Fallout experience I'm used to having.
---
Thanks. I'll try that.
---
Yeah, on my lvl 103 it’s still pretty annoying. Though in the city it’s not too bad, once you’ve the robots are friendly
---
I'd love that. Get screws and ballistic fiber at low levels and some ultra cite and flux at higher levels.
---
Some people’s happiness is so dependent on small things.
---
Yeah, same here.
---
Yeah overseer rank really doesnt mean much more than showing how much you've played. You cant really judge someones skill based on it.
---
Yeah you’re right on both counts. I can’t wait for the Wastelanders DLC....OMG 👍 I’ll keep a look out for you &amp; will know who to call on if I get stuck 😊
---
I would like to see a solo mode for it. It would probably be easier for me to fight one person than a whole squad because as it is right now. About 60% of the time everyone just decides to do what they want.
---
Lead can be found in abundance in the lucky hole mine. Go there with excavator power armor and you'll pull alot. Just remember to use super duper when smelting and you should pull around 200.
---
Other than that I would suggest building your camp next to a lead resource hole (or whatever its called)
---
Yeah I love the CS for close combat. Heavy weapons definitey are awesome for longer distances, in combination with a grenade launcher it’s good stuff. Just wish they would XP for damage done instead of downs and kills.
---
I run a Gatling... because I've learned to shoot people from far away. I can't do that very well with a minigun 😅
---
Well the level 14 was saying he won a lot and knew how to play sooo
---
Seems like an uphill battle OP. People will do it. It’s old hat!
---
I would go with archery and swimming as the other two.
---
There's more than 1 active?
---
(/s  Hi again /u/lamarcs)
---
I think its you
---
Oh shit, even the PC version is $17 there, that's cheaper than Bethesda Launcher price!
---
I've noticed there are significantly fewer legendary ghouls in WS and west tek. Three star ones only drop one star goods most of the time. If they drop anything higher than one star, it's guaranteed to be a garbage melee item.
---
Idk. It's a ps4.
---
Cheers! Been having to server hop killing robots for 45-60 lead at a time
---
scrap.  scrap everything, not only does it give you xp and mats, but also unlocks mods for said weapon
---
I’ve heard and seen it’s sometimes as early as 8:15. Not as many people do the event now though. I generally server hop for it, but a lot of people don’t like to do that. I have a feeling that if no one shows up it may not spawn on its own unless someone shows up. I could be wrong though.
---
Bunnies? Am I getting so old that I’m missing gaming lingo??
---
Played 20 or so matches, never disconnected once. PS4.
---
Maybe it's your connection?
---
Yep. Shaking my head, I’m a huge collector of all junk I can collect, sometimes I’ll just run through whole regions getting junk. I also did the breach and clear event, so this is after about 2 hours of me walking through the forest and toxic valley doing treasure maps and collection junk for scraps. 
---
I fast travel to the bottom of the map to do breach and clear, and a group of 2 level 180s are there. I ignore them and do the event, and I’m clearing enemy’s after,  and they began to run in front of the enemies I’m hitting. 
---
Needless to say, I got one shot by them. I don’t even want to hop on anymore I feel so bad
---
Do you know how much of a multipler its is and how does it work with other bonuses 
---
For example if you have a bloodied gun that does 100 base damage at full health and 185 at 20% health would the crit multiply the 100 or 185
---
So salty. Must have absorbed it from all the ball sweat in your mouth
---
Has anyone else on the trial found the difficulty ramped up real fast when trying to follow the story missions?
---
I tried to go to Morgantown Airport and was met with level 60 glowing monsters... Then tried to go to grafton to talk to the mayor and was met with a giant monster (level 30) and a parade of protectrons... It just meant I spent like 30 minutes running away from the monsters.
---
I'm level 7 by the way.
---
Otherwise I'm enjoying it very much.
---
Sooo everyone hopefully learned a valuable lesson.
---
I don't have the option for this with the underarmour I have, does it not work with underarmours?
---
Sometimes you gotta know WENDIGO home and try another day.
---
inb4 yongyea makes 9 million videos about how this is killing fallout.
---
I’ve not seen the fire reset as you say, but it could be. I think it’s best to still make sure you have/get kindling.

That’s a good viewpoint. Story wise I’ve never been into ESO. I enjoy my own mental role playing within it and I have a good time. It’s much more of a wild action gameplay wise, after so many hours in ESO I went back to Skyrim and then oblivion for another play through and was just meh. I like being able to roll around and attack and then leap back to avoid the counterattacks.
---
Maybe the issue has to do with the original issue to do with FPS when the game was released. Could be a counter measure? Does your monitor allow you to set its refresh rate through its own menu?
---
Yes same here. Finally started using my stockpile of previously saved legendaries for scrips. With the amount of new players pouring in, it might not be a bad thing.
---
Purified water really doesn't cost me time or resources. My purifiers crank it out--even with just two small ones--and I find cans of it everywhere.
---
Bottom line, I always have more purified water than boiled water on hand, and specifically boiling water for recipes IS time and resource-consuming.
---
Damn. I guess I'll have to move my camp next to a pond. 😕
---
No, you can find them in NW.
---
You soud pretty cool, I'm not on Xbox One, but if you'd like we could add eachother on Discord? :)
---
Does the homemade rifle not benefit from the rifleman bonus if it has a non automatic receiver on it?
---
Player vendors are good spots. The little green tent icons on the map. Hover over them and they'll tell you how many of what items they have. 
---
You could also try locations like Whitesprings or the burrows (Harper's ferry) as I usually pick up a few legendaries there. 
---
You might be straying away from your level appropriate areas or going to places with higher level players which will cause a jump in enemy level. 
---
I had a similar issue in my level 40-50 range.
---
Lmao I stopped playing right before I got to Morgantown
---
(Not because I didn’t want to keep playing because of irl reasons) so I’ll make sure to take caution on that lol
---
Ah ok cool. So just keep server hopping and hope for the best?
---
*NEW* Atomic Store cosmetic items! You can now bling your thing with the latest styles and show off to your friends!
---
Like draugrs?
---
You can add me to play fexjn
---
SE of top of the world by the plant on the map
---
I'm allergic to bullets and that is definitely a HP de-buff
---
Yeah ESO really did the combat right, what broke it for me was a lot of the little things that betray the core of what The Elder Scrolls stands for, like restricted character classes, races restricted to factions, the world not being truly open but sections of it closed off in one way or another. Not able to just loot all the things. It felt wrong to me as a TES fan.
---
Agreed, I’m high level as well and am only doing the event for a chance at free badges. Sometimes though, when doing it solo I don’t feel I have the time to check the kindling, especially on the 3rd wave.
---
Yea I get you but that wasn't my issue. The whole enemies respawning when another player comes, or spawning at other people's levels combined with quests that need &gt;1 person to complete was what lost my interest in the main game. Other players themselves didn't bother me.
---
Its actually a reminder card now (saw it today) and says that NW prebeta will remain for those who own the game.
---
Verify you have good internet connection.  Restart your router...I had some difficulty with the last PS4 system update not uploading correctly causing crashes and I had to manually re-update.
---
I'm leveling up a new toon (just hit 20), and he's getting close to maxing scrip today.
---
You just have to know where to look.
---
I just finished a game where I got to the finalists. Still shaking
---
Yeah get it later
---
The only mission related max level weapon I am missing is the somerset special lol. I had the same thought about NW😁
---
All of the positive replies to that tweet make me sooooo happy
---
Yeah I don't know if it was just bad luck or that you need to be level 60 before you go on with the main mission... But be aware! Haha.
---
Ah, the days of a rando SB showing up and then running away for ten minutes.
---
Well sell me on it. What do you believe the game offers to people who are fans of the Core Fallout experience that can hold us over until Fallout 5 comes around?
---
Yeah that’s really shocking lol
---
Yeah, but not massive as MMO suggests
---
When I run the event, I play it like I’m the only one there. It’s become a necessity. That dude was micromanaging, not helping.
---
Just a robot to pick crops &amp; do  auto camp repairs would be awesome!
---
What chems would you recommend getting addicted to?
---
Run uranium fever events in blackwater mine near whitesprings. Chance at 3, 3☆, lvl 40 mole miners.
---
Good idea, I'll try to do it tomorrow.
---
Most importantly, kill all the things.
---
I understand. It does get annoying
---
Trial convinced me to buy the game. Having great fun so far!
---
I disagree, they aren’t religious fanatics they are specifically mind-controlled.
---
Upvoted this and a dancing emote.

You all do know your tv's and head sets come with a mute/off button eh?
---
Yes 😂😂😂 The 'Or' is what I usually say to a T when that happens 🤣
---
That’s not possible
---
You had this in mind the entire time. You're like an evil genius. Lol
---
Eggsaladass#3816 There's a theme with my usernames baha
---
NW makes me very happy but the constant losing of perks in a very competitive mode does not
---
I ran across him on a road. He said his insult and walked on. Well he would have if I didn't shoot him in the back. No robot gets away with insulting me.
---
Was his name AimJunkiesMediaLive?
---
What are you saying lmao, its more than possible to have either bolstering or vanguard bos armor
---
I thought you were singing Adele there for a minute 👌
---
We get it Oxhorn, you like cigars
---
Couldn't be. I'm at home alone running 60mbps when yesterday I had a full house and managed to play just fine without getting dropped.
---
He needs 2 luck for starched genes.
---
I'm offended! I was 16 playing halo 1 when I dropped my first teabag...
---
BOS FTW.
---
haha same, I'm also a baked bean bandit on Discord!!
---
Haha stop being a shithead
---
He’s right, gunplay has never been one of fallouts strengths.
---
Scrap them.
---
When I first started I would be like "Ohhh, a level 30 revolver, I'm gonna save this!", then soon realised guns like that were quite common and I didn't need to horde every single thing I found.
---
Can I give you a republican “I do not recall” on that so as to partially keep in line with the sub’s witch hunting rules!
---
I'm sort of surprised no one else had posted about it yet, to be honest. I have trouble believing I was the first person to report it!
---
Some goodies that I think would fit nicely with Fallout’s theme: 
---
- Nat King Cole: “Love Me As If There Were No Tomorrow” (day before the bombs fell), and “Thou Swell” (for CAMP building together)
---
- Ella Fitzgerald: “Too Darn Hot” (NW Fire), and her duet with Louis Armstrong: “They Can’t Take That Away From Me” (memories of pre-war life)
---
- Chuck Berry: “Johnny B Goode” (for the guitarists of Appalachia)
---
- Lena Horne: “Stormy Weather” (rad storms) 
---
- Louis Prima: “Whistle Stop” (train stations)
---
- Cab Calloway: “Reefer Man” (for all the chems and vendors selling them)
---
Very true, itd be so much better than spending hours upon hours of just claiming workshops and killing stuff like i originally did lol
---
If I see someone giving an honest opinion on Fo76 or NW and not bandwagoning, I instantly sub. It shows they have integrity to not cash in on an obvious circle jerk.
---
Powered assassins cav ...dam that a good piece.
---
I think more people would show up for the Scout/camp fire quests and events if they could get some use out of the backpacks while also having power armor. At least give us the refrigeration ability for food when that gets added if it hasn't already.
---
I don't believe people with PA builds even bother with the scout missions because they have little to gain from it for that character.
---
Now on the other hand, NW is providing an excellent alternative for leveling alt characters with builds like pistols that they may not have been able to do properly trying to level in AM. So, once those people come out with builds that don't require PA you'll see a slow surge of them coming to do scout missions.
---
I got one on my first NW match and was excited until I used it and I have to agree with you completely it felt underwhelming to say the least when I honestly thought it would be a top rated gun for the mode, the .45 smg and the 50. Cal has been my favourite to use so far.
---
This was such a pointless long post lmao, I hope more people do this
---
One thing that might help is a fast vampire weapon - either a mr handy buzzsaw or an automatic combat or handmade rifle
---
Having an automatic weapon is pretty meta rn lol..
---
Hit square to turn off team adding. I play it solo all the time.
---
That’s an idea.  Or stay on the server you are in. Just visit people’s camps that have vendors. I’m sure someone will have whatever you are looking for
---
My bujeebuz, the loading is killing me. Some games I load in, get a few kills and then I die.. requeue for 5 min and rinse and repeat.. The useless waiting at the start every game? Come on.
---
I've seen several rocket launchers. Know what's worse? Tesla rifles that don't miss or how about miniguns that mulch you instantly.
---
I've resorted to having a cheap outlook on sales. Anything that has a value is sold for less than 20 caps. Most junk is free to be given away.
---
Yeah the new intro music is fantastic
---
Yeah I get it lol
---
I've been thinking about this. It's a safe way to get xp without using any resources or wasting any levelled unique gear.
---
Drop it
