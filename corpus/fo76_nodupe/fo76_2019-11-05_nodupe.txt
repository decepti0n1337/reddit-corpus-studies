Ps4. Sorry, dude. Good luck with the hunt.
---
---
---
I'd love the plan, just for the completionist in me. How much is it?
---
Bummer....  that hurts even more now. I want it. But I can’t be stressed out with NW...
---
FYI - I think you can buy the red fireman helmet from Capt’N in the Whitesprings vendor area for a few caps.
---
if only we could have seen this coming...
---
Project Paradise is my favorite event to run. Takes actual coordination and is difficult for more reasons than bullet spunges and hard hitters. It feels it has a solid mechanic to it unlike most events. It is difficult, but once you get the hang of it, you know what you have to do to beat it. For this reasons, Encryptid is my second favorite event.
---
Yeah it gets worse the more you do it too because you start getting repeats. The recipes sell though. I forgot to mention hard lemonade, which is what I use vodka for, sold pretty well when I was selling it. It's has a really strong effect. I charge 20-25 caps per since farming sugar is a pain. Rich players will buy it for convenience.
---
Not sure if its literally every other time but man it has happened an awful lot. And yes it has happened when simply inspecting the weapon too.
---
Yeah they can I think. I had a couple of scorchbeasts around my camp in whitespring. Even with all of the robots as my guards, it’s still dangerous
---
Shit
---
It wasn't a complaint, I was just describing what I experienced but ok...
---
help?
---

---
thats great!  have many of them been legendary?
---
get any decent drops off em?
---
Good decision. Those are only few issues. Sad part is the support team will either ignore you or treat you like a idiot. I'm done with supporting this trash, abomination of a game. After a year player were \*ucked by Beth multiple times... only lies, lies.
---
&gt; **What are your thoughts on the pioneer scout, sheepsquatch, nukashine and project paradise quests?** 
---
Respectively, interesting but poorly executed, interesting but final battle doesn't incentivise enough for teamwork, awesome character but very low effort bland quests, great environment, terrible execution and testing.
---
Can I get a link?
---
Yeah it’s shitty because I love NW.
---
Would give platinum but don't have money
---
Later. It's not even a question. Maybe start up a couple of weeks before the official launch of Wastelanders.
---
This is a dead period that you're coming into. Not worth it. You'll only get pissed off like many others have before hitting the new DLC. There is a reason why you left. That same reason still exists.
---
I'm sending you genuinely good luck on getting your blueprints to actually work.
---
Voted
---
It's been a while since I used mine, but I think I remember being able to pick up the ultracite spikes again. 
---
All it takes to craft is cobalt flux and steel I believe and with super duper and ammosmith it's not the worst prime gun to have, just wish it had a silencer.
---
A nuked whitesprings usually gets me 80-100 unstable cobalt flux with green thumb and good with salt (just in case). Then I stabilize with super duper on for about 12-15 stable flux after all is said and done.
---
Overall, none are geared towards casual players.  You either find them boring over time or they can’t really be completed properly.  
---
PP is impossible for a casual.  
---
Scouts takes forever and you just get bored and ignore it after tadpole.  
---
Encryptid was fun, but having to run many, many times for the fixer plan...I just bought it from another player and ignore it now.  
---
Biv is fun, but lousy rewards.  It gets meh quickly.  
---
3/10 on the casual friendly meter.
---
I just bash with whatever I'm using.
---
there hasnt really been any new PVE content for a long time - except for raids ( which there are mixed opions about and is also not solo friendly) .   So - if the the problem was a lack of content - nothing has really changed.
---
"Yeah!  And why can't we build faction vendors at our camp to meet our daily cap limit?  Where are the buildable ore veins and magazine and bobblehead spawns?  For that matter, why can't I build a fissure at my Camp to farm Scorchbeasts."
---
It might be a stretch, so bear with me here: Maybe we're supposed to explore and travel the wasteland instead of holing up in our Camps all the time?
---
Thanks. I have had the exact experience from the opposite perspective (I was in the patrol) in the past and it was great. It really takes effort though and the game does not make it as easy as it should be, but it can be done!
---
Lol well if you're ever in Morgantown, my door is always open
---
Man, I really don't want to sound like a hater or a cynic. I really don't. Seriously.  But it's hard not to think that Bethesda has put out a subscription service to mike some more cash out of the remaining players  before shutting the game down.  They don't seem to give a damn about all the problems in the OP's post, but they are asking for a subscription fee.
---
Wow is $15 a month for a $60 game, and that's just to play the game. This is for an entirely optional portion of a game you pay nothing to play every month.
---
I wish man I wish
---
https://fo76map.com is okay, but it's not the same.
---
Dang I hope youtubers jump on this one
---
No one will listen, it is a race to kill everything as fast as possible for the reward and server hop to another running event, the 1\* boss drop is irrelevant, the plans and costumes are what people are going for. Speed is of the essence.
---
I'm torn between sitting on a porta-potty and this.
---
I'm two sacrificed goats down. Need all the help I can get!
---
DCG more like 2500 with adrenaline chems and food.
---
Don’t come crying to the discord when Nukapedia is missing vital information then
---
Yes.
---
There are a lot of things you can place.  The biggest difference is that you can arbitrarily place your CAMP anywhere outside of a named location (with some exceptions).  You do have a limited budget and radius to build in.  It's enough to make a pretty well-detailed 2-story, 3x3 house or so.  Turrets consume a fair bit of budget, and there's also a limit on how many lights you can have (40, I think).
---
If you search around for player CAMPs, you'll have a pretty good idea of what's possible.  You can't go hog wild with it, but you can do enough to make it your own.
---
Someone likes bdsm low key
---
Again, not at all what I said read the title before you comment
---
If I have it, for free. Would it count if you buy it and not acquire it in game though?
---
I've have the fire breather helmet, just doesn't look right with a red helmet and yellow outfit. Also will be cool to complete the set.
---
Good luck but seriously, mentally prepare for the worst. In my experience even a semi complex camp doesn't 'replace'.
---
Just happened as of this post, sentinel showed as legendary but killed so fast just had standard loot.
---
It's really bad.  So many people are of the "it's only a one-star" mindset, but end up laying into it for some reason.  I've started standing in front of people with heavy automatic weapons just to try and get a shot in before they blast it into a fine mist.  I find that people who wield Gatling Plasmas and refuse to switch out during events are the worst offenders.
---
I hope everyone remembers this when Todd is up on stage saying how great ES:6 is.
---
Then it comes out and deals pitiful amounts of damage and cant be legendary. Oh god please let it be legendary
---
If they’re going to make a video on something 76 related I’d rather it be something like this.
---
Yeah definitely! Some people are lucky and get good rng drops, me.. not so much. I'm off for tonight but feel free to message me on my GT Badgerist, I'll give you anything you need that I have
---
I've been putting it off for ages, it keeps escalating on my brain, I've waited till after the Halloween, it's Judgement Day.
---
Damn, why not? The last time it was nuked I finally was able to farm a decent amount of high rad fluids.
---
Votato
---
&gt;you are capable of thinking only on yourself. 
---
&gt;Do not support other's problems when the others gave their time and work for you...
---
Those are the same thing, got it.
---
They are all decent with pioneer scouts being the best imo. It has the best rewards and adds tons of little tasks. Honestly bethesda needs more quests like this for people to work on.  More daily quests that award points for choosing your rewards would be good too.
---
No no keep playing
---
I can sit in front of her and let her spray acid all day all over my body and not risk dying
---
Are you fucking serious?! I used this alot in my time..
---
Gimme a shout and we can meet up whenever you're next on captain. GT JaggersLips13
---
Didn’t the war start a few weeks before Halloween? So it fits anyway
---
I drop to a knife and tag, but I have had to get on top of the spawn point to even get a swing hit before the robot dies in a hail of heavy weapon damage of all types by high level ranged players surrounding the porch.
---
Anyway, no real loss, but does show the bloody minded attitude of so many Fallout 76 players, me me me!!!
---
I’ve never seen ‘Someone to talk to’ :( also now that dailies give scrip aren’t most worth doing?
---
No quest for project paradise.  Great summary of the events!! Upvote!
---
Is there the same gun-storing glitch from F4? (In Fallout 4, you can drop guns from your inventory and store them in your workshop, which will lower your settlement’s Size bar even though you haven’t actually removed anything new, thus allowing you to “exceed” the build limit because the game thinks you’ve been removing complexity).
---
I checked the statistics on this, and I 55% agree
---
&gt; Adventure players who complain about it are being entitled.
---
I mean, if NW wasn’t a broken mess with tons of hindrances (being returned to the main menu after every game, wonky collisions, cheating, lack of text chat, etc.) it could actually even be fun for PVEs to play this mode. But here we are.
---
I bought the shielded casual from Grahm yesterday
---
I kind of like where this is going.
---
I started again because i need a chill game to play.
---
I quit 7-8 months ago and not alot has changed.
---
The core gameplay loop is the same and I'll quit before i grind endgame like i did before i quit
---
That's not the point.  OP didn't post here for build advice.
---
Must have been before or after the event b/c you don't drop a loot bag during public events anymore... That said, Raiders gonna Raid man, y'all been warned.
---
Today I witnessed the same activity as the OP describes above. In addition, does anyone else get a strange visual flicker and clicking noise while in Vault 51’s lobby? Like others, I was working on the 14k grind today, then this started. It doesn’t happen every match, but I figured it was tied to something dubious.
---
I recognise your GT! Yeah mate that's awesome cheers, I might be on in the morning (8/9 hrs from now) then definitely on after 21:00 GMT
---
40% swing speed knife and on top of the thing still died before I hit, quite a challenge.
---
I think people are preempting, timing the spawn and they start firing before the robot appears, so it is instadead.
---
Do you have any data to support your theory about the user base of this subreddit?
---
That's a good idea, slow damage.
---
Voted :)
---
Err?
---
You guys need to unban the person who has been helping find bugs for you guys. The 76map guy. You guys banned him, but the cheaters are running rampant in NW. And look, I love you guys. But it's getting kinda out of hand. It's pushing more people away. I wanna see this game flourish, but it seems to be just cheaters and bugs lately..
---
Lol take this down...that would be fraud my guy
---
Ooh I want to know
---
But with swimming you can actually move around without being heard or seen. On the toilet you just have to hope the circle stays on it. Doesn’t provide cover to new locations.
---
Though there is a secret room someplace that’s even better because it’s totally walled in from four sides and you can just drop in from the ceiling. I’m not sure if the room was just developer oversight or what. It’s like someone walled someone in to die there. I found it by noticing the rooms weren’t taking up all the small building.
---
My heart is broken. I went to Map76 for everything.
---
Vomit boy is a high level troll, a 3\*, look at his posts :D
---
They didn’t want revenge? When I ate someone they came after me.
---
Yasss. Perfect captain! Gimme a shout! GMT. The real time. Xx
---
You always dropped junk on dying and survival was pretty dead.
---
What's your build? I'm running a bloodied handmade single shot build, and I don't push that high to one shot a SBQ
---
Even a single piece of Poison Resist armor makes a world of difference.
---
The only criticism I have with the Mirelurk Queen's poison is that the projectiles can be very difficult to see sometimes.
---
i wasnt trying to fraud but i can see how it sounds like it
---
I’m sure you can get a lot of things for free if you lie and commit fraud, doesn’t mean you should!
---
Its called maxsons jacket. It was free with atom purchase a few months ago
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
It's good enough for Rolex, it's good enough for me 😎
---
Scouts are tedious, shine is too short amd the items are borderline useless (forgettable to say thr least).
---
Sheepsquatch and paradise were too buggy for me to bother with.
---
This. Some dude saved me at mischief night. Go to heart him, instead I wave me hand in the air like an idiot.
---
hazmat has no physical defense
---
I know on survival it was like that but the standard area your junk was safe. It gave you time to get it back.
---
All go just looking out
---
If you're doing enough damage to potentially one-shot a legendary, you're definitely not dealing low enough damage for half a dozen or so players to also tag it, even if you hit a limb.  You're getting downvoted because your "tag" weapon is too powerful to reasonably be called a tag weapon and that's a dick move.
---
Yay!!! Alcoholllll
---
I like you, you'll go far.
---
Man, fuck this game and this company. I'm legit just unsubbing. I've tried so hard to give this game the time of day but it's messier than every other bethesda game out there, run by shitty capitalists, and outright negligent to their most helpful players. Even the burning debris isn't entertaining anymore. I'm done.
---
You 😊
---
Awesome! They can also sell us a starter pack of cards and then sell more card packs on the Atom Store.
---
I was wondering how they could work the loot box gambling mechanics through a backdoor. This would be the way to do it!
---
Genius! /s
---
Yeah, you're not special. Anybody can run a bloodied or sneak build.
---
I'm not in it for the karma, I'm in it for the SCIENCE!!!
---
You think I have the camp budget for that?
---
Really sounds more like the actions of a cannibal. So hooked on human flesh that youll be a full on Wendigo by next week.
---
This is on my alt character, pure melee, so I usually wait for them to land to wail on them. It works out in the wild, but they wreck my base in the meantime doing that strategy where I am. My defence is just to log off as soon as I hear the scream :/
---
It ain’t so bad being a dick https://youtu.be/E7Sr-cpFwUc

[removed]
---
I thought he stopped covering fo76?
---
So you are looking for the energy cell mod for the gun right. Just look up a guide for that
---
Actually, a better speed run target would be the pie on top of west-tec, no fast traveling to vendor camps.
---
That gun.
---
I seriously doubt it.
---
Yep, picked one up from the Cap'n for 29 caps the other day. Same Fireman helmet that drops from the MN event.
---
He did a vid on the event a few days ago. He’s been doing Borderlands 3 and Outerworlds because there’s nothing else to nuke in 76 till there’s an update.
---
You've always dropped a bag of junk on death in adventure mode. You can get it back as long as nobody takes it but its always dropped as you die.
---
Honestly, the Fallout 76 community is one of the most dedicated, friendly and beautiful fanbases in the entire world. It's downright heartbreaking seeing what Bethesda is doing to this game.
---
As a 90s programmer, I love this &lt;3
---
Really?? Gonna have to check that out then.
---
He isn't talking about the firebreather one friend. For some reason you can buy the Fireman Helmet that matches the new outfit in the whitespring toy store
---
Oh, let's hope not... although it looks like that, I am enjoying the game.. should Platinum it before it DOES get shut down shame really though Bethesda had a potentially great game on their hands
---
They shut down Survival to free up server resources for the paid premium "private" worlds.
---
You must be real self-centered to admit to playing selfishly in a multiplayer game and expecting sympathy from those same players you screw over.
---
No legendarys though, just a repair bill
---
Same. I carry around 3 melee weapons as two are weightless and would rather not be left weaponless, carry around a mutants lever action amd have been trying to use it more lately because melee gets boring after a while
---
How are they griefing you if you chose to fight them?
---
Shut up
---
Shows how I think. First time I had to reload what I new to be a full mag, I just assumed it ate my bullets, lol. Had take notes on how many rounds I had before logging...
---
“Yeah you guys will get unlimited scrap day 1”
---
To
---
“Fuck wait no, it’s limited, can’t do unlimited yet sorry”
---
“We’re going to incrementally increase it, starting with 400-800”
---
“Fuck you give us money”
---
That sorta sucks, my other characters camp is probably only 200 meters away, but it’s never been attacked by anything stronger than mid level scorched
---
Yessss! The frog and chicken idea, I love it! Also I wish we could tame the radrabbits!
---
I always liked project mappalachia https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY
---
I can throw an outfit your way for 500 caps. Afraid I don't have an extra hat though.
---
You should move.
---
I feel like Someone To Talk To is also bugged...
---
And wait, dailies give scrip? Since.... since when? Oh god, gotta add a new column to the spreadsheet
---
Yup. It's retarded.
---
You would think this would be scary but in the lake it’s so murky and deep with buses and sunken boats which provides cover that it would be like hitting a needle in a haystack assuming they aren’t taking cover while swimming
---
Huh?
---
i was but hated it so much that i got a refund from paypal
---
I know what u are talking bout. vtu south building had a bugged out hole where u could drop down and be inside the building, I heard it was fixed tho.
---
Yup, I can't believe I forgot to mention that one. It's great, just takes a bit of scrolling. ;)
---
Rule 4, but okay
---
Didn't know Nukacrypt had a map project, it's missing certain stuff like the lvlfirefly spawners on the northern part of the map but it does have other stuff.
---
Would be a great camp feature/ game mechanic
---
Voted.
---
its time to accept that this game is completely limited to being "sims 76" where all you do is buy stuff to put in your house because as soon as you try to do anything else you get hamstrung by endless bugs and crashing.
---
its sadly not a far off comparison if you look at how the sims got monetized in the later games and a smaller and smaller group of whales enjoyed that type of paid content until the entire line of sims was dead
---
The sledge is worth a good amount for sure.
---
You could definitely sell if you wanted
---
I enjoy the game too and I do hope I am wrong. Seriously.  But man it's hard not to think  this stuff.
---
I wasnt that I payed attention but I keep moving in the lobby, I don't stand around til im picking my location.
---
WOW
---
Anything Bloodied with faster swing speed &amp; Bloodied explosive would be great weapons. In my opinion. 🧨
---
ruLe 4, BUt OkAy
---
I think it's called the Elder's Battlecoat.
---
Part of the E3 Bundle they did a few months back.
---
Oh big true, maybe they could be 1% budget items like fridges and scrap bots, and not the fucking 10% Brahmins are or the billboards
---
It's the Elder Maxson's overcoat, and was an exclusive item included in the Quakecon Atom bundle. I don't foresee it being available again, unless they offer it at Quakecon 2020.
---
Yeah I already tried to see if it was an option, unfortunately it's not. I don't understand why they still don't have skins for every weapon in the game.
---
The classics never go out of style.
---
Been looking for one myself on Xbox. Not sure why they are so difficult to find.
---
Do a charge back by your bank for Fallout 1st!
---
Yep, sure is... not sure if it will be the hatfields or mccoys but roger in the mortuary will be seeing green for a few.
---
you can install them as your in-game map too with https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/313
---
I enjoy the random encounter map and the bobblehead map the most.
---
Well if you know anybody on Xbox with an extra suit. I’d buy it.
---
Nukacrypt also allows you to search for weapons, but you kinda have to know what exact name to search for.
---
Example, if you search for "Action Hero", you get [this data.](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/Survival_50CalMachineGun_TheActionHero)
---
Go to https://nukacrypt.com/search and select 'Advanced search'.
---
Having the same problems. I've frozen or crashed out during Mischief Night at least half the times I've tried it.
---
If they do announce they are shutting it down, I'm being legit I will take that game off their hands and then turn it around
---
No it's recurring. Cancel before or you'll be charged
---
I didn't choose to fight them. I guess grief might not be the right word. One player invited me to something on adventure mode (I'm on pacifist mode). He said check out my camp and it was somewhat destroyed. I encouraged him to join me to destroy it but he didn't want to :(
---
He wanted PVP but wasn't able to plus, I don't really care. I get to have fun by enjoying myself dancing around and saying awkward shit when killing me or destroying my camp.
---
Lastly, we weren't on a team or anything.
---
Yea, I finally completed it but I don't know how to claim it, like do I build it or something?
---
Great Bethesda trying to get more money out of us.
---
I mostly try to find things that I can sell to other players.  Extra magazines and bobbleheads, uncommon plans, rare hats and outfits, etc.  I don't usually go out looking to start a big event like SBQ or raids, but if somebody launches a nuke at Fissure Prime, I'm there.
---
I fill in any spare time with tweaking my Camp, turning in bug parts for mounted plans, and sometimes even getting over to Morgantown for an alcohol recipe from Biv.
---
Sweet, even on PayPal?
---
So, if they're not a 1st member, they get a stealth insult, but if they are, you're just disappointed?
---
You tried to be patronizing and sarcastic, but the Disclaimer killed it.
---
3/10 for effort.
---
The .233 Pistol from fallout 1 and 2 was a beast. The Mauser and Desert Eagle would also be cool. Basically every weapon from Fallout 2 needs to be added
---
Why are you being downvoted, Bethesda have said they're doing this!
---
499 ;)
---
Survival servers (at least on PS4) were always dead.  They were never full when I went on, and when you sever hop it was the same individuals.  Only time I saw anyone do anything was when people tried to do the challenges that gave you a 3\* weapon. 
---
My best guess is that there wasn't enough interest in it, especially once a different PVP option (NW) was released.
---
Oh shit that Forest Camo Jumpsuit I got from that wolf event(where you have to hunt down 3 packs) is actually very rare? Wow...just wow...
---
Also I guess I'll have to do a combination of Battle Bot AND Lode Baring from now on to try and get that sodding plan...thanks!
---
I agree with that last part.
---
Yeah, FO76 has been pretty much my favorite game this past year. My ass could handle cherry-hot railroad spikes, but FO 1st really rubbed me the wrong way. Don't hate us, but pray for us my dude
---
Start with a refund.
---
*shifts eyes suspiciously* Mmm maybe about 5k caps OP?
---
Neither are god tier. Sledge is decent and the laser is not bad.
---
Vo ted
---
Yeah, that's true, but then you have to look at that all the time. ;)
---
I just stick with Perk Loadout Manager and SaveEverything for now. People like Better Inventory, too. All available on the Nexus. PLM is the best mod ever: switch between up to 12 decks on the fly.
---
So you wasn't in PvP with him and he destroyed your camp?
---
Oh you guys are asses
---
Bethesda- "Time to patch this ."
---
Especially on PayPal
---
Yeah it's considered an atom shop item so you have to build it in the armor workbench.
---
How about 6k
---
I mean, he's got valid reason for quitting. And I don't deny those, but doesn't this post seem a little disingenuous to anyone else?
---
"We found an exploit a month ago and got quickly banned" - well that really sucks but, then why does it matter that they can't cancel Fallout 1st if their testing account got banned before it released? Yeah, sure, multiple accounts people will say. But, why in the blue hell would anyone give a company $100 that just banned one of your accounts???
---
And the reason why they canceled Fallout 1st was because of a bug, which was fixed within 48 hours, and no atom shop discount? I can understand the thing about private world's, and I've never seen the tent just randomly disappear. No time was given with the discount, so how can someone hold that against them less than 2 weeks in. But really? I ask again, why did they give them $100??
---
And the thing about the "only" new free content being NW rewards is odd because that's a blatant lie. And if they have a problem with hackers, which they should, then why did they give them $100???
---
Also, the last point about more bugs. If they bothered them that much, Why. Give. Them. One-hundred. Dollars.
---
Bethesda is gonna Bethesda. Their games have bugs. No one, even a dedicated Bethesda fan boy, should have shelled out $100 until after they see bugs get fixed and atom shop discounts. I subbed to Fallout 1st, for a month. To try it out. I enjoy it, but I also know bugs are gonna happen and I accept that. No way I hell I would give them $100 without something to show for it. Make some improvements, give some value beyond what you stated to get everyone on the hook. But to give any company $100 for a yearly subscription before they actually have time to make good on promises about said subscription is just gambling with that money.
---
The BETA was NOT free, you could not rent the game and little info was out initially, hell review copies weren't even handed out until launch day or after. Besides, not liking the game was not the sole reason for a refund, it being broken, lies being told and them misleading people about their right to a refund caused them to be forced to give out refunds.
---
See, in Australia we have this amazing thing, it's where you are entitled to a refund. That's it, unless you directly cause destruction upon the item you are returning, you get a refund. Period. Our law is amazing like that.
---
Word, thanks homie.
---
I run Quack Surgeon, but the game chucks Alcohol at me, so I never need to buy it.
---
But, I also can't sell off the excess, even at 1 cap each.
---
Issue was resolved, but some did loose a ton of collected scrap, months and months worth.
---
I thought you were buying lol
---
No, but received an email advising me to watch for it.
---
not here for that kinda negativity fam, but thanks
---
No I’m selling
---
No, received an email last week, and figured it enough time had passed it was worth it to see if anyone else had
---
Absurdly rare, in fact! Well done!
---
90% of the xp comes from surviving. Just drop somewhere close to the middle of the map, find a good hiding place, and watch netflix or browse reddit for 10-15 minutes until someone finds you or the storm kills you. Rinse and repeat as needed.

I refuse to go lower. You win.
---
I believe the data miner's pulled the drop rate for rare outfits from the game not long after release. The rate varies by region but goes as low as 0.25% in the Divide allllllllllll the way down to 0.02% in the Mire.
---
You don’t have to explain yourself brother. S’all good
---
I wasn't in PvP. He didn't fully destroy my camp. Just bits and pieces. 
---
How did he do it? I don't fully know. I know it's possible to destroy some of camp pieces as I've seen it possible with groups of people just constantly shooting at someones camp.
---
Plus, I do have the messages to prove that he did destroy a part of my camp. 
---
Lastly, I do know I was on adventure not pvp due to being on the same map after the event at Whitesprings and not taking any dmg when he wanted pvp.
---
Lol thanks, I'll hook you up with a bunch of pumpkin plans along with caps, sent you a pm
---
*anime girl profile picture* yeah this checks out
---
And I will diligently work to prove that guess!
---
The world map. Nice verticality. Really neat places to stumble across. Varied environments. 
---
The map you open - way better than the old PipBoy maps. I like how it’s a souvenir map you found lying around.
---
The gameplay loop is still Fallout for the most part. I’m playing... that other game at the moment, and I’m missing proper scrapping, looking for that specific bit of junk I need, and other things.

The survival aspects. Eating, drinking, etc.

Real time VATS. I just love it, and would like it to be an option in FO5. I do VATS build because the most RPG-y to me.

Mole miners = best new enemy. My first encounter was approaching a Red Rocket and one quietly glided across the doorway, startling the hell out of me. Wonderfully creepy.

They won't see this and wouldn't care if they did.

Report their teammates too. The cheater knows their account will eventually get banned, they are really farming XP for the teammates.
---
The game will pretty much tell you which order of regions to check out but it's generally Forest -&gt; Toxic Valley -&gt; Ash Heap -&gt; Savage Divide -&gt; The Mire -&gt; Cranberry Bog.
---
Good idea that you thoroughly explore each region before moving on. You don't have to but it helps manage your level so you don't go rushing into an area where you're too weak to handle it.
---
Encryptid simply brings out the worst in the playerbase.  It's the one event I hate with a passion and not because it's sort of hard.  It's because other people make it far harder than it needs to be.
---
Despite my strong feelings toward it, I joined it when it popped up a couple of days ago.  It was a very sparse group(4 players), but I was convinced we'd do fine if everybody pulled their weight.  FIRST GODDAMN MISTAKE.  As the event continues, it's clear that nobody else intends to take the first pylon.  So I do.  Thirty seconds later, I'm actually screaming my head off because I'm still the only one tanking a pylon on top of the robot horde, wasting my super stimpaks.  The guy who started the event goes, "But I have Healing Factor".  "Guess what? So do I!"  I ended up having to take on two pylons and burned through at least 20 stimpaks, but if everybody had been ready and willing to work together, it could have been over so much quicker.
---
Ikea
---
If only there were other Fallout games available for you to play.
---
Christ no. Bad enough with the whinging as it is without adding something like that in. They need to focus on what they have out and the backlash before they try that carry on
---
If Bethesda did see this they would deduce fallout needs more utility items and fallout 1st perks
---
I agree, game could use more people roleplaying as factions. It's tricky because it's not like the game gives you that many ways of doing it, so high five to you for doing your thing.
---
Please don't eat me though.

---
It seems that those spaws are disabled. My group and I have checked loads of different private worlds since release and each time it's the same result, every possible colour uniform spawn is empty.
---
I agree overall with your list, I think Toxic Valley is actually skippable if you are following the main story, but I agree there is great value in the mid teens to level up there and do some quests.
---
Survival was relatively dead and the ones that were using it were complaining about people camping at spawn points. They have said they will revisit the idea again once they have Wastelanders out next year but they will be looking at new ways to implement it
---
Not defending the engine, but blaming the old engine for everything sounds like echo chamber type stuff.  I'm convinced that 90 percent or more of the people blaming the engine know almost nothing about programming or how gaming engines even work.
---
Its Grafton Day...Again!.....
---
Man I killed soooo many Grafton Monsters there in my 20's.  Good easy exp and items to scrap for mods.
---
Survival servers died after they borked PvP with damage caps. There were people with invulnerable / one shot builds, but everyone else had a blast fighting. 
---
Then instead of fixing the broken mechanics, they nerfed everyone else, who promptly left. Then when survival mode was dead they said “oh well guess no one likes PvP” and axed it.
---
I thought the same thing.
---
I'll check and see if you're still selling tomorrow.

They did ban a few people for using homophobic slurs during PvP.

Pretty sure the machine in flatwoods ALWAYS gives you a pie on the first time. All 5 of my characters have gotten a pie there, its scripted to do that once per character.
---
I understand and empathize, however getting mad and ranting can’t fix anything. There is enough of that on these posts. I lost all my lead, copper and adhesive. But we all know we can get it back again. We are not forced to play the game. I like it and I buy the bundles, Fallout First, and merchandise as well. I meant to put money on my prepaid card I specifically use on line to get Fallout First for my other character. I also like to travel, but I can’t get mad because someone pays more for first class seats and I am crammed in the back. (Sad part is I can afford first class, but on principle I won’t for anything that isn’t to Europe or Australia.) I don’t know what to say to people who are upset. All I can say is about that people who are upset should use their purchasing power to make a stand over what they believe to be a important stand to them. I see people on here attacking others because they do not share the beliefs. It is kind of like I have to stop playing Fallout because someone else doesn’t think that $8.99 is not a fair price for something that they believe should be free to all. I do believe that some of their moves do not reflect an understanding that a lot of people turned their backs on them (Bethesda) while others stayed loyal. Then to do some questionable things to those who stuck around is not entirely cool. I never played an online game like this. Except for Red Dead Redemption, but I played offline mode because of things I did not like. Everyone needs to examine them own selves and make decisions that are right for them. A piece of advice to them as well is no understand that they could have a stronger stance if they kept complaints and rants to a minimum and be a little bit more reasonable.
---
Wait a second... *Logic?*

I came here to ask the same question and I then I found out your post.

Thr buzzing noise and the freezing is driving me nuts, I've tried everything, guess we just need yo wait u.u

Awesome...I'll check it out. Thanks for the reply.
---
What game breaking bugs are still around???
---
Sorry for the delay, life got crazy.     
---
Sucks I know, have them added and hopefully they will fix it!
---
You catfish me? Lol
---
I like how you avoid admitting that you were trying to pass off your setup as 8k. Neither you nor the guy who started this comment chain are running 8k setups so just stop.
---
Im afraid I didn't get the pm. Why don't you just add my PSN and I'll just show up in your world and give it to you. My tag is Kagoru-Rhodes. Also I don't need the pumpkins I have all the ones I want.
---
I do that with YouTube.. it’s still miserable, 200-600 Xp on average. That would take over 50 games, &amp; I couldn’t play anything else. Ugh it sucks ass but whoever gets the outfit really does deserve it. Can’t hate on that dedication.
---
You forgot step 5. Keep doing stuff
---
what system?  How much for each?
---
Haven't games gotten card playing before in a DLC? I could see it happening OP. Don't think it has a big chance but I'd really like for them to add it back in from NV
---
That Gun, and the AMR. And honestly, I’d be fine with the AMR just being a cheap skin for the hunting rifle.
---
No I brought my set up up because your claim that you can't see above 4k is ridiculous. ultrawide gaming has been well past 4k for years due to how drastic the difference is. Trust me I understand pixel density and PPI perfectly well.
---
It is you who made the assumption it wasn't possible to play modern games in 8k at 60fps. Now you are just clinging at any excuse you can to claim "HA I was right!" because you can't accept you were talking out your ass when you said you can't play games in 8k at 60fps.
---
Ok sent
---
Step 4, is just a reeaaally long step, I haven't made it to step 5 yet.
---
If enough do yeah but then that also assume they care enough to vote?
---
Question: To those who have the subscription when exactly do they have the atom payout? Is it the start of evert month or when you go and one month from buying the subscription?
---
yep, as far as the game is concerned they are rifles and the commando perk will increase their damage
---
This probably isn’t the place to ask that....
---
I think you are missing the enclave masks
---
Yeah but like I said if the hit boxes in that game had some form of collision interaction that would be the end of that exploit
---
Why would you want actual DLC behind a paywall? You want wastelanders to be paid vs free? That’s absurd.
---
I’m just hoping by some sheer luck or the hand of God a Bethesda employee will see this and help. I’m kinda over it at this point already uninstalled the game and everything. I just want my 13 bucks back from a purchase that shouldn’t have even gone through.
---
I can confirm that they don't care. I had trouble with FO4 after one of their updates and filed a ticket with them. Effectively, after their update I couldn't open the game past the start menu, it resulted in a buzzing noise and then the equal of a 'Crash To Desktop' on the XB1. Well, after I explained the same to Bethesda in a ticket, and had a few interactions and attempts to resolve, I was finally greeted with 'we're aware of this bug and we'll be releasing a fix in a future update' or language essentially saying 'fuck you for now, we might fix it later. Good-bye!'
---
Yet, I managed to resolve that issue on my own by erasing all of FO4 from my XB1 and doing a fresh install. All those poor saps I rescued from cryogenic slumber, only to realize they were SYNTHS THE WHOLE TIME, gone...like tears in the rain.
---
So, the moral of the story, Bethesda doesn't give a fuck about your petty issues playing this dumbass game, or any other of their dumbass games, you're lost in the wasteland, you figure out how to play these dumbass games yourself. We might fix it in a future update, but likely, you're going to figure out how to fix it by scrapping out a hot plate, a toaster, and a sensor module and covering all of that with toxic goo. 
---
Addendum: FO4 improved for a while on the XB1. I managed to have some great times with adding mods to it and expanding the capabilities of the game. Until, subsequent updates made all of that fun go straight to hell. Thanks, ~~Obama~~Bethesda!
---
You should of just used Straw Poll, free and people can instantly see the results.
---
So you uninstalled because you accidentally bought 1st twice? That doesn’t make any sense.
---
No I uninstalled because I don’t care for the game and the company anymore. Especially after this.
---
I like how they have such big brains at Bethesda 450 xp you get it 750 xp it doesn't give you your 450 xp on your 750 so over again NOW 14K xp your out of your mind Bethesda it takes 2 hours to get 2K a hole day to get 14k dude just stop you make it so everyone hates you Bethesda cause your ruining 76 your lucky people still play
---
The survey sample of 100 was infinitesimal compared to the total responses (~46K) so yeah not accurate at all. They have a spendy pay wall for the full details.
---
Tbh ea has been fine for this last years
---
Because seeing the result could/would influence votes?
---
There's a huge astroturf campaign against the game so yeah it would be bombed
---
Currently on the lotus pose photomode strategy until I get enough perk cards for it. More difficult to get into the top 10 with it on the Morgantown map than it was in Flatwoods.
---
Would just be a nice simple chill feature for friends and people looking for more with camps
---
+karma
---
Why are you still hopeful they'll implement cool stuff like that?
---
 You are the one shitting on people. I am entitled to my opinion, I'm not imposing anything on anyone.
---
When the results are released I will provide actual screenshots of the page for your viewing pleasure. This way you can be certain there are no shenanigans.
---
Why did you buy 1st in the first place then..?
---
I can tell the difference on the reload. I often take groundpounder off to equip the lockpick cards (which is a stupid thing to have to do, like i forgot how to pick locks) and it is noticeable. Maybe its a glitch, maybe not. Thats the fun part of bathesda games, you never know if its broken or working right.
---
What system?
---
Am not offended in the slightest. :)
---
 I think you misunderstand the word vital, but that would explain so much ... ;)
---
Awesome thank you so much!
---
 Indeed.
---
Nah, u drop paper bag container instead of gun.
---
I call bullshit.
---
It might be stretch but making the game more tedious isn’t making it more fun, asking to be able to scrip legendaries at your camp isn’t asking to be able live at your camp or make it excessively easy. Maybe for you it’s just a blast to fast travel to train stations and stare at loading screens, and if you consider that “exploring the game” then some other fun activities you should try are “loading simulator” and “grossly over exaggerating a request on the Internet”. Do you get it or am I just talking to a brick wall? Keep it salty ;)
---
Bullshit on what? That I bought two instances of fallout 1st within a week of each other? Do I need to post a screenshot of the purchases?
---
And your source is?
---
Same as anyone else who bought it? To try it out for what it was?
---
Look for me, gottencrab45009
---
He really isn't that wrong though, he is wrong about budget, but studio size he is right. Bethesda Austin the studio that made this game only made one game before this and it was cancelled. They are a small inexperienced team.
---
What system are you playing on? 
---
I haven’t seen any of these bugs yet on PC
---
Ya you’re right! Thanks for the input! 
---
I think I’d lean more toward stealth but to be honest I’m up for anything.
---
Where did I say "only"?
---
Erm, I bought it on the 23rd played up until the bug happened where it didn’t register you had fallout 1st, and then my dumbass thought it expired so I went to the website saw that I had no active membership and went and purchased it again. Later found out it was a PC wide bug, and I immediately put in a ticket for a refund, and haven’t heard from them since. I made a reddit post about this almost a week ago, if you’d like to see? I uninstalled the game because I don’t want to play the game anymore. I’ve got a lot of other games that don’t have an over abundance of bugs in it. I did however get the entire pirate and fireman costume from the Halloween event that was fun. But until the DLC comes out I’m just not going to play it.
---
And that’s also the issue I have with this. How was I able to purchase it twice? Why does Bethesda’s website allow you to purchase it twice?
---
This.   
---
 I'd add that completely exploring every last map pin and completing every last side quest/daily you run into in those areas in that order will also help insure op doesn't wind up in the mire before op is ready.
---
When did I say you can't play current Gen games at 8k? You are so desperate to reframe this into something you can win it's pathetic. Here's my original comment:
---
&gt;did you even read the article? people who claim to have 8k are just kids that think they know what "top of the line" is and quote the biggest numbers they find in google. dont be a fool. 8k would require a massive screen to have a visible difference  to 4k and screen that large have awful input lag and awful response times, even in 2019. you cannot game on a 8k screen made for photo editing. did you even read the specs? and why would you want to be capped at 60hz. thats absolute garbage for FPS games where the BARE MINIMUM to be competitive is 120hz.
---
Is that me saying you literally can't play at 8k? No, that's me saying it's impractical and stupid and literally impossible to see the difference. And you've proven my point by linking several monitors that you would need superhuman vision to be able to see the difference in pixel density. When I point that out, you try to switch to ultrawide as your argument. Keep on talking about pigeons and chess though, it's adorable that you think this looks good on you.
---
I get downvoted if I defend the game, and I get downvoted if I uninstall the game and don’t support it anymore. Make up your mind people.
---
Thanks! This is similar to what I already run with some subtle but important changes.
---
I wasn’t aiming for anything, ive yet to find any decent legendary gear and while I’ve researched the benefits of the two main Metas without testing it myself I’m unsure which would better suit me.
---
It never gave you time to get it back
---
I voted, again!
---
I don’t know why you care so much what people think.
---
Thanks for the input! I like the direction you’re going. I’m currently struggling with weight myself, so I often hide in my excavator armour simply for the extra weight!
---
I was just genuinely unhappy with the service and legitimately just wanted a refund because I didn't want to use this service any longer. I just noticed how I still kept the remaining time of membership and items. I in no way want to commit fraud
---
I'm sorry that you're going through this. This is betrayal at the highest level.
---
I got a month's subscription of Fallout 1st for free as a gift. Even still, it's stuff like this that makes me realize that even at free, playing the game is too costly.
---
I don’t I just want help, man. I don’t need debates, I don’t need to be berated, and I don’t need to play the game. I just need help lol. The same thing happened almost a week ago on my last post about this.
---
Thank you!! I’ll see what I can do with this. I like a bit more sneak but have the perk points to move around now to try something similar
---
Definitely want a dummy to attack and test your weapon damage.

What trippy to me is peeps are flipping their shit over a scrap box, yet no outrage over the rampant NW hacks going on in PC.  
---
Hmmmmm.....  
---
Anywho, the cheats are why I don’t NW.
---
id kind of like it if NW rewards where easier to get for 1st members. say each item awarded is lowered down the level scale if you are subscribed. say to get them all it would take you to level 70 or 80, not 100.
---
Hunh..... odd, good to know though!
---
Also why they think Bethesda would want that domain in the first place
---
Can’t wait to see the results

Stealthboys need to go as well.

"He's a drifter, just blew into the subreddit." - Reworked Spongebob Meme
---
The few times it hasn't happened have been where there have been very few people doing the event or server as a whole. Which is a shame because it's a ton of fun with lots of people causing mayhem. But whenever there are more than 10 people (most of the time) it seems to crash the game either during or just after the event.
---
I almost never get this error or game crashes on other PS4 games I play. (it's a pretty new PS4 pro) Didn't happen during meat week. But happens all the time on Mischief Night.
---
The office.  You are better off watching the office while it's on there. Give 76 a break... I have
---
Nope, just frustrated that this is what has happened the last three times through the event. It's a really fun event. The robot is neat and I'd like to know how it was created and/or why it decided to do a Mischief Night. My personal theory is that it was somehow rejected by the other white spring robots for being odd or different cause it couldn't speak so downloaded audio files to be able to express itself and wanted some revenge.
---
I bought Fallout 1st just to get the deal on atoms and it took THREE days for my account to actually receive benefits so by the time I was able to unlock the Halloween stuff and decorate my C.A.M.P... it's November. Though I probably would have kept it Halloween for a long time anyway. Didn't even get a response on my support ticket still.
---
Never claimed I did any research, just said I've never heard of a statement Where Bethesda said there is anti cheat in the game for aimbots, and the cheaters I've seen in game have never been banned. Calm down don't get yo knickers in a knot. Thanks for the link
---
Darkrui98 you are a smilingly senile hairdresser!
---
Yes each pallet contributes to healing. I have a VE pump and it heals a lot wit each hit
---
I've always wondered but now I know. Thanks for confirming.
---
Look at what is being said. I'm not at all blaming him from purchasing Fallout 1st. What I'm saying, and you know I'm saying this given your disingenuous response about blaming the victim, is to have some scrutiny to people's claims and don't blindly assume it's true just because you agree with it or it fits your agenda.
---
It is truly sad that you have a thing in place that automatically downvotes irrespective on the nature of the contents. Speaks volumes as to your lack of critical thinking.
---
Are those printed from screenshots or are they real magazines that she bought?
---
Well if that's what you want to do, but I'm still in the process of buying all the serums, so I need the caps
---
Nice! Thanks, I wanted to make sure before buying one.
---
It's a lot of fun. Very hard to die while using it :)
---
Before Halloween. I don't compromise.
---
Functionally I'd say they're nearly identical, but the number of objects you can place and the size of the build zone are much smaller than FO4. As someone else mentioned you can build the equivalent of one moderately detailed and sized home or you could spread it out to make a semblance of an outpost without much small detail.
---
Overall I think you can have fun with building in 76, I find the world more interesting than the Commonwealth and so it makes scavenging and going home to build more satisfying. Plus it's nice having other people stop by to see your place occasionally (more frequent if you run a shop). But if you're used to creating whole settlements-- or worse, you've become dependent on mods like Place Anywhere and the many free FO4 assets-- shifting to 76 can be a challenge.
---
The goods news is that budget and being able to build close to other players are both coming up next, but will likely require subscription to access them through private servers. The base game will never be able to handle large player constructions.
---
That's a pretty awesome idea. Really lends itself well to the photomode of this game :)
---
It procs per pellet, yes.
---
The healing effect itself isn't instantaneous though, so even though you'll get HP back, it may not restore quickly enough to save you in a tight situation.
---
Still fuck no.
---
I use a ballistic Bock on my junkies dude at sbq and stuff, not really something I'd buy from a vendor though
---
Nice! At first I was thinking trap. Sorry to hear about your mom.
---
He said after the event. Alot of ppl die from all of still alive robots bc everyone just goes after the one star and not all the ones shooting everyone in the back.
---
But what is going to be worse; stubbing your toe on a rock and take almost no damage, or riding a bicycle, hitting a rock and falling forward off of the bicycle, and probably almost crippling your head.
---
Being able to sprint up a hill, down a hill, and on flat surfaces at the same speed and use the same amount of AP, or riding on a bicycle down a hill faster for less AP, on flat surfaces faster than sprinting for regular AP, and up a hill for normal sprinting speed but for more AP use?
---
Just some queries to think about, I'm not critizing, I just find it hard to implement this into an MMO like Fallout 76, in fact it sounds like a rather fun idea. But if it is made into the game, it probably be put behind a Fallout 1st paywall, knowing our luck.
---
It's a good time. We're waiting to grow a little more so that we can have like photo contest. They even do meetups for photoshoots. The one recently, they got everyone with a mr. Fuzzy outfit to go sit on the mr. Fuzzy roller coaster and take pictures.
---
Sorry for the delay. Toxic Valley events are your best bet.
---
You haven't been paying attention. A lot of people over many months have brought this issue up time and again.
---
Can I get a tl;dr on the most interesting tid bits of information?
---
you know what's wrong with video gamers in 2019 vs 2000... in 2000 we played games...in 2019 we fill out bug reports and complain about every little thing we can...
---
No, you don't deserve this. I may not like that you're supporting Fallout 1st but no one deserves to be cheated out of a fair refund nor be ignored by customer service for a week.
---
Have you also posted this in the official forums too?
---
There's easier ways to get caps than hoping someone doesn't understand decent pricing, though. More proactive ways. But hey, you do you.
---
Took me three times to nuke. 1st I crashed halfway through. Second time someone beat me to it when I was halfway through. Third time, nice and slow, took me hours as a stealth sniper but I did it. Will I do it again? Lol no.
---
there was a guy who speedran the game to get to the other side of the map to play a specific instrument.
---
They aren't in it for the fun of PvP they just want the cosmetics.
---
only to a point, you can't die from either.
---
Wow!!!
---
I didn't know. I assumed you would die eventually. Bethesda should think about implementing that.
---
I use it now to revive players since I need so many stims for the event.
---
Thank you. I greatly appreciate it.
---
I haven’t, but I will now thank you. I had completely forgotten there was an official forum.
---
I appreciate the thoughtful response. I am humbled and grateful.
---
15 card sets for 1500 atoms. One card set per day because they deteriorate over use and time. Trade with caps. One card set for poker,  blackjack and caravan. You can upgrade into a placeable biome for the card games to protect the users from hostiles.
---
This is so adorable! I love how a meta thing like this grew out of the game. Hope your group remains strong and active. Really do :)
---
Yeah I said screw it just don’t enjoy the mode not even with frog legs
---
Your an idiot I said in other games or can you not read
---
No but I don't play the game definitely should of been there. So much people that complain here haven't played since launch or never have played.
---
Yeah i was wrong dont have it sorry if i raised any hopes. Was planning on just going around and building it for people if i did have it
---
What about when you get in or out of power armor and it breaks your reload speed buffs from speeddemon?  That one has drove me nuts forever.
---
Depends on the type of melee build - mine wasn't effected by the changd
---
This would be cool
---
Voted no.  Wish I could have voted "not only no but *hell* no."  I already paid for the game once, I'm not paying for it again continuously.  Game devs need to get away from this shit.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This makes me seriously reconsider if I should even buy Elder Scrolls 6 when it comes out.  Since that one is (supposedly, if Todd is to be believed) going to be single-player, maybe they won't try this kind of shit.  Here's hoping.
---
Ummmm......AMAZING
---
Hello, I have sent a request to the group, I am from Mexico but I also like to take photos within the game, I hope to be accepted.
---
The gravestone would be the loot bag, you can set it so it's your death and/or drop bag
---
Yup
---
Voted again.
---
Oh, stop being such a negative nancy just because of the Fallout 1st fiasco. If "they didn't care," they would've cut and run after the disastrous launch
---
In 2000 you shipped a game and made sure it was good because you didn’t have online services to patch it every week - you also didn’t have nearly the technological spread that you do now regarding development (that’s what AAA stands for ;)) so sorry bud - your argument doesn’t really work here. 
---
If this game shipped in 2000 it literally would have bankrupted Bethesda.
---
I just asked them for you, they declined
---
&gt; They have the financial motivation to make the game less enjoyable to play
---
And therein lies the issue with MTX in general. No matter how 'cosmetic only' or 'you're just buying time-saving properties' they say it is I will always in the back of my head assume that the game is being sabotaged in some way to get me to spend more money.
---
Xbox
---
Yeah I relied on the hacker perk just spamming the hack button, worked pretty well
---
You know fair, I take back my bullshit call. I’m sorry for your misfortune. You actually have proof for this btw. I can admit when I am wrong.
---
What does the 3DS have to do with the Xbox 1 and PS4..?
---
You should get the plan on your first SBQ victory.
---
I've gotten legendary bonus drop from workshop defense when defending against scorchbeast attack
---
Interesting, now that I think of it I’ve only done the scorchbeast defense like a handful of times.
---
We call them obsidian purists because on the web they seem to be tough as nails but in actuality are weak af. /s because the people here don't know what is sarcasm unless it's labelled.
---
Check the Conclusions section near the bottom. Yes I did think about the TL:DR crowd :P
---
Sledge is good, Gatling is pretty bad (I’d probably scrip it).
---
I think they are called Forest Scout Armor Mask and Urban Scout Armor Mask if you are looking for placement
---
Seems like x box has a lot higher crash rate issue.
---
Aha, yeah I know.
---
You consider that Gatling “top tier”?  😳
---
The only Ultracite Gatling (that still drops) worth a damn is one with FFR. Even then, it’s not great.
---
So you want me to bring the truck over and help you move?
---
We're talking reload speed, not movement speed.
---
Sure. $15 each
---
See I'd say never, Only because I think they could've made something a bit better like a Super Mutant skin as a halloween costume. I think the skeleton is cool, but its so original for a nuclear wasteland setting. Idk thats my thought of it. I do like your answer though! Lol
---
 Now this attitude saddens me. I have played all the Fallout 3D games many times and finished them various ways. It never occurred to me that I had "beaten" anything.
---
Good tier for a bloodied build are usually BE, B25, BSS, etc.  Neither of these items are god tier.
---
Okay, I believe you but I guess I'm gonna have to test it myself too. I have a commando VATS alt with a few explosive guns and extra skill points are scarce between Perception, Agility and Luck.
---
We're just trying to keep the game we love alive
---
Voted again!
---
You definitely will my dude!
---
I assume there is some way to quick travel to the event, so just remove all junk, and go try to live long enough to finish it.  I know next to nothing about it.  if you're in that big red circle, I assume you die, but then do you get the reward?
---
Pretty much true, the only reason i'm almost 50 is because i want my hellfire baby back.
---
Nice choice. I’ve watched it enough to know the scrips at this point lol.
---
Where do I cancel exactly ?
---
Never ceases to amaze me how low this company can sink. It had it all at its feet. A loyal, passionate fanbase willing to create content for it for free.. and what does it do instead of devoting some of its resources to encourage said growth? Fucking monetises it into a half assed club. Everything since creation club has been pure sleaze.  Not one generous, inventive gesture. What a fucking shame.
---
Cool camp! Thanks for sharing all your hard work.
---
My advice is to not make one.  Make one or the other so that you do the most damage for your type of build.  A hybrid (that uses way different stats) isn’t a good idea if you want to do great damage at a high level.
---
Yeah I have the Rusty key
---
The irony in it all is that you would need to pay roughly a 1st fee for your answers about 1st subscribers.
---
The Enclave event Dropped Connections has given me a plan for heavy metal legs in the past. I did it in Watoga, and it's the only time I've ever found a plan for heavy metal armor.
---
Yes, record haul of HRFs for me, 21 in a single run up and back in front of the cottages.
---
As soon as I realized I was set back to 0 on the next day and by the 3rd day both challenges were visible, I decided to wait til they were all up. Currently at almost 3k xp but I only get to play a few matches a day.
---
Good to know!
---
I'll see what I can do!
---
I think after everyone votes you should charge $1 to each person after they already voted to find out the results.  Then when you get the $1 you could give them just part of the data and then say that if they pay a yearly/monthly subscription of $1 to you you’ll provide them with the rest of the data and more future voting info.
---
Still looking for a game
---
No, lots of people are not doing it. It is still a small niche group.
---
For real. The community managers only respond to mild or “Thank you, Bethesda!” posts. Unless people bug them enough. But even then, they always give the same cookie cutter response of “We’re looking into it.”
---
I just got into a NW lobby and was being punched mercilessly by someone using this hack. Can't wait for the match.
---
Really short sighted of them, and they definitely should know better by now. Hell, I usually get my shots in on the legendary sentry early and then *specifically* target the assaultrons.
---
Bummer.
---
If it helps my first nuke in the first month after launch crashed like that too.
---
I’d advise to pick one or the other. Melee or ranged, not both. You can then move some points around elsewhere
---
To be completely fair, statistics beyond a basic understanding is very complicated
---
Not a bug but if they could change "eat corpse" to a long hold like they did chairs and instruments, that would be great. 
---
Died way too many times accidentally eating a ghoul in the middle of a fight. Like who thought combining the jump and action button was a good idea? 
---
The same could probably be said for other things like searching for extra ammo or meat.
---
I carry all my magazines and bobbleheads with me because I can never remember which ones I still need. Just a couple days ago I managed to finish the few comic collections then put them on display but up until then I have everything with me and never had any of the issues you mentioned. (On PC) the only thing they specifically mentioned is that they reduced the weight of the magazines bobbleheads and teddy bears from 1 lb to 0.1 that's why you have so much extra storage space
---
Mmm the Faschnacht masks are displayable. I'm not sure if the helm is part of the outfit. Btw that sounds fucking awesome OP. There's a few other golden skins. Maybe you can track those down too
---
I'm just leveling a Nye character and the valley is still skippable.
---
After morgantown and the highschool takes you to Welch/evan for those 2 main quests.
---
Now I'm at top of the world

Make VATS available through perks. (Probably an unpopular opinion)
---
This is total mad scientist at is best!
---
Fast travel actually represents bicycling....
---
Ty, finally someone who understands (and the explanations in that link are exactly what I was trying to say).
---
Not sure how this would cause more whining, or whinging as you say. I kinda miss the era where games had minigames (besides the dumb Nuka tapper etc which looked cool in an arcade cabinet in FO4 but are pointless in 76).
---
I'm hoping they bring back the gold-plated .44 pistol. I missed that one :(.
---
That's a fairly odd thing to happen. I've seen random sb before just south east of Seneca rocks around the camps.
---
I haven't even seen it. I'm just saying in general, lol. Is it a suit or what?
---
In a word, yes.
---
Helmet is an independent item so I see no reason why it wouldn't display. I just tried to put it in display and the only issue I had was not enough workshop space. Haha. So "should" be fine.
---
Should have been an event style buff/debuff like the meat sweats :(
---
Not particularly mad, just a friendly local Responder!

You know some Bethesda employee is sitting in the backroom laughing while reading your comment.

Why? I feel like I’m getting the best from both worlds. I’m fairly new please elaborate.

---
I was at a sbq event, the server lag was *really* bad.  I press jump, suddenly I'm flying upwards high enough to be eye to eye with the written2, friend saw it and was like wtf bro.
---
So I tested something.  I hit jump and held it.
---
I flew waaaay past the sbq in the air and hit the vertical height limit far far above where she flies, burnt through *8* fusion cores from that one glitched jetpack jump.
---
It needs to be fixed.
---
Its like what you'd see for a skeleton costume but the skeleton glows. Its ok but too original
---
&gt;measly $100
---
You have never been poor
---
Voted.....again
---
I wish I could find these somewhere!
---
&gt; they had subs day one
---
Because subs were required to play the game on release
---
I would buy the sledge for 3500 if you were on ps4
---
I like how aten_ra shows up with a link proving what I was saying, and you just downvote him.
---
I need that donut plan.......
---
I would take out some points from int and move them to either agility for sneak attack bonuses or luck because luck has amazing cards like serendipity. I only have 8 intelligence max on any character. You really only need 5 because that’s the Max Lv of any one card and you don’t need them on unless you are crafting. Also the limb dmg reduction is not really necessary in my opinion. I have never held that card and haven’t gotten any limbs damaged for months🤷🏻‍♂️ maxing fire proof will go farther I think.
---
Like the body suit type of thing then? Interesting.
---
Honestly, I'm just waiting for an eyepatch.
---
If your on Xbox I might have an axe for you. Also it would be epic if you rolled around in the white responders version that would be amazing
---
That was one of my favorite build locations. That hole just gives so many build potential options, but like you, it took absolutely forever to get the stairs to line up properly with it.
---
Needs a cryolator if available
---
They changed it before release so it had different benefits because everyone was outraged at that
---
Get a hunters rifle of some sort and blast the wings, I get this in the mire and they hardly ever land, but usually you can lure them away a bit so they don't demolish your pad
---
If you attach this vid to a report on the Bethesda website, he should get banned.
---
He did not have to do it and was not inclined to. Be grateful for what he did and stop being an insolent child about it. Bethesda caused this, not him.
---
Go firebreather! Be a Barbarian! High strength, high endurance, fearless, 2h only and qol perks like the ones which keep you from being dehydrated. Padded and fire resistant, be a firebreather!
---
Sure if you want I actually started a new guy but playing now.
---
What a joke. This is someone who is going above and beyond to help the community. People at ZeniMax and Bethesda need to be fired.
---
I have 60 bobble heads and 100+ magazines on display at any one time on my comic book merchant. I don’t crash but when I look through my inventory I get lag spikes if this helps.
---
thanks for the info!  ^^
---
That would be sweeeet! I really dont buy the outfits though, i like the building so i go for furniture most.
---
Adamantium skeleton is a godsend for close range explosive builds, but other than that it is unnecessary.
---
Its really sad how they do this to players helping out the game. Its basically unpaid work and they ban you. What a joke
---
Do you have descord
---
Well that makes sense I never thought of that.
---
I've been kicked from games because the game thinks I'm cheating. Gives me a message saying cannot join, you have modified game files or something

Voted again
---
No $15 a month!!!
---
&gt;Statistically it is *not*. Statistically you’ll get any weird number, probably more like 60/40 or 70/30 split. 
---
Depends on your sample size. The larger the sample the closer it will get to 50/50.
---
Sorry for the delay, life got crazy and then I made a couple posts and got over 2,000 notifications in 2 weeks. :(        
---
Thanks for the comment, great info!  
---
Added to the "Wiki" pages, the FO76 pages have hit the character limits, and this allows me to also historically track the bugs.  
---
Link to the ["Weapons - General" Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dfh1va/fallout_76_bug_roundup_weapon_ranged/) (tons of sub-pages being built)
---
I do, but you can find your Teddy gears at amusement parks for free, and the hood Is somewhere in Whitespring, buy it for less than 50 caps.
---
Ok. I was only asking because I spent to many hrs hoping servers and never found it
---
Usually you want your game in a decent spot before it goes on steam or it kinda kills the game.
---
Didn't they change them recently to deactivate once you shoot?
---
That's why I play nw on Xbox nice to play nw without seeing any hacks
---
AP Regen and a couple poison resist for second star effects
---
I am on Xbox! currently I’m trying to grind for both the white variant and the Halloween fireman gear. No luck only got a pirate outfit
---
I mean I feel that'd be fair because 1st might be the reason they stopped. Unless you mean people who've never played it in which case yeah hopefully not too many will do that.
---
This also a good because with 15 strength you can kinda create a heavy build by taking the melee perks out
---
The character I'm using now is just past level 200 - I use the game to rollplay being in a radzombie apocalypse, so exploring/adventuring/visiting camps takes up most of my time. When I need junk or supplies I'll either wander around or visit a spot where I know the resource spawns, and heading to events to play with other people is much more rewarding than breaking down plastic plates and office desk fans alone
---
I think part of the problem is that even people who understand how statistics work still think that a 0.0000000016% chance or whatever crazy bullshit impossible odds obtaining the rarest fasnacht masks were set at is absolute horse shit.
---
I saw a thread the other day saying on ALL servers theres a % chance of certain items spawning(bobbleheads, magazines, PA frames, fusion cores ect.)
---
But the fact remains that there is no sample size where you will consistently get that result. That’s the point here. 
---
Each time your odds are the same. At 100 tries you may have 8 drops. At 200 tries you might have 22 drops. Or you might have 18. So on and so forth. You will realistically never actually get to the 1:10. The amount of tries vs drops is so unlikely to hit that perfect number that it’s not even worth considering. People seem to think that 10% chance means 1 guaranteed drop every 10 tries and that’s just not how it works.
---
Loom on the looking for group posts they sell between 5-10k caps
---
Move.
---
Would be nice if all communities on Reddit related to Fallout 76, websites, forums, discords, etc. shut down for one day in solidarity.
---
For some reason tanagra town ore always repsawns for me even if it was the last thing I grabbed.
---
Very useful list. Appreciate it. Is there a similarly detailed list for plans out there?

You missed a pretty important option, I think

"No, but I will try it when Wastelanders comes out"

You need to type better sentences

[https://imgur.com/a/rlHikdy](https://imgur.com/a/rlHikdy)  
---
I have my Morrowind strategy guide after 17 years. I remember when bugs were an intermittent problem versus a constant problem.
---
What about an option for "I'd try it if there was a trial" or "I'm considering it"? I do a FO playthrough and am considering re-doing 76, I'm interested in the "private server" (even if ol' B screwed the pooch big time, but most of the people on my friends list likely don't play anymore, so /shrug) option.
---
You’re missing out on a lot of quality of life and utility perks such as weight reduction, mutations, white knight, blocker (very helpful for melee / close range builds) and stealth. 
---
I specialize as a shotgun build, but use an instigating / power attack combat knife with no damage perks aside from bloody mess and I can one shot most enemy’s from stealth (and no I don’t run a bloodied build). Point being you can still do both without fully investing into melee since it’s already strong especially in stealth. if you wanna go with an in your face style melee build then you’ll want some damage resist perks or else you’re gonna take a beating.
---
One of my characters has the perks to never get addicted and triple benefits. That means +6 strength from a bottle of whiskey, and 75 percent hydration with no downside. 
---
So, yes. But I would never buy it: there Is booze everywhere for free.
---
So they would answer no, I guess ?
---
Deliverer and throwable spears.
---
Did you get my fried requests
---
It’s actually quite stable on a private server when nuked. The XP, farming scrap and having all the enemies for yourself is it’s own reward. 
---
All you need to do is have the costume hat for the last security bot to get the bonus.
---
Dude, that $60 game will last you long past a month if you get one you like, it could even last you years. Treat it like 76 itself, you payed $60 for everything in the entire game right? Now they want you to pay $13 for the tiniest fragment of the game and charge you the same again afterwards for the privilege of keeping it.
---
I use an explosive shotgun so it makes my life much easier lol
---
I’ll be on in an hour or two and I think I have an extra Pirate costume.  If I do, I’ll give it to you.  I don’t think I have an extra hat.
---
My gamer tag is JeffinGalveston.  Just shoot me a message.
---
I have about 10 melee weapons on my main, he also carries a hunters handmade for SBs. No melee weapons on my bloodied or junkies rifle guys

lol seems like i hit a nerve right there. you can't even admit that sometimes you need to be a dick towards the even shittier dicks.
---
Voted!
---
&gt;But the fact remains that there is no sample size where you will consistently get that result. That’s the point here. 
---
It's not about consistency per se, it's that with a large enough sample, you decrease the influence of inconsistent variations so the true probability is evident. 
---
"We can see from the graph that relative frequency gets better (ie closer to the true probability) as the number of trials increases."

&gt; People seem to think that 10% chance means 1 guaranteed drop every 10 tries and that’s just not how it works.

I haven't seen any examples of that. I'm one of the people that OP is talking about, and he's misrepresenting at least me, if not others, by saying that, because I definitely don't think that's how it works.
---
Wow ok thanks. I should be on for another hour or so. You can take a look at my inventory and see if there's anything you want!

It worked, a massive amount of patience, but it placed, main problem being, the Node is under water, trying to position the foundations.....

Never said it wasn't a niche group, just pointing out some PC gamers absolutely run modern games in 8k. I mean hell the resolution I run at in games is literally 6880x1440...

Hottkarls is a good dude. Offered to pay him an extra five hundo caps for him to pull a piece of armor I needed out of his vendor. Tells me he's a millionaire in the game and gives it to me for free for trying to tip him lol

Didn't get a friend request what's your ID? And yes I have discord TechGYQ#9886
---
I haven't thought about that actually! I will look into it! Another project perhaps
---
&gt; We discovered it, tested to make sure it was real, and reported it directly to the community managers. Our accounts that we used to verify the exploit were promptly banned. We have been contacting support explaining that we are the ones who discovered and reported it, but have not gotten a response. 
---
This just breaks my heart. We have a great community that shares, endures, and volunteers to create or test things out without pay, credit, or recognition. 
---
To be simply ignored despite all they have contributed just goes to show that the team in Bethesda that's handling this game has serious issues that go beyond the development or maintenance of the game itself. It is not hard to send a quick "We are or will be investigating this, will get back to you soon" message, but to not even give the time of day or any sort of response is just terrible.
---
Ah here we go
---
Yeah you are entitled to your opinion, what You aren't entitled to do is be an asshole about it which you were hence the major downvote for you.
---
If you like doing things solo good for you but don't be an ass if other people want the help and convenience
---
Same here (I technically don't "buy" anything, only use free atoms). Camo stuff is always the most interesting. The outfits on the shop are always ready niche and wierd.
---
Answered!
---
Instigating or bloodied hunting rifle, OR Gauss rifle. I have both. Bloodied seems to work better because that character also has unyielding everything and adrenal mutation. 
---
Stalker Is great if you use Vats.
---
Yes, just do it /before/ the event starts, so everybody has a chance to adjust.
---
It's actually fun when nuked, and gives some nice variety.

Thermic Lance and keep it as broken as it was.

honestly Fireproof 3 is enough

lol steam lol

\- them.

steam can give refunds

they dont "have" to.  so thats why.

I like the Capture the Flag one. I was kind of eh about the Nuke-ball until you mention swinging a mini-nuke, and well, now I’m sold.
---
Why do people still believe that customer support is a direct line to a company? Most companies don't tend to have internal support departments anymore unless they're super big. Your support requests are all ending up in some call center somewhere around India where they're taking support tickets from God knows how many companies at once.
---
Nah, but I can still say you are wrong, weak, and common. Does that make me a dick for pointing out your mundane and tiresome stance? And if so...senpai, are you proud of me?
---
I just swapped from a public server to a private one (mine).

10 seconds in: crash.
---
I expected some fiddling.  FO4 was the first I jumped on as a pre-sale.  I had heard the horror stories.  But Fallout in Boston (I lived there 20 years--12 in "Nordhagen beach") was too good to pass up.  I was shocked at how bad some of the launch bugs were (keys not remappable at launch?!), but a month in and the worst were settled.  A year in and FO4 was waaaaaay more solid than this.
---
I never had the stability or the just plain asinine issues I have now *italics*(all of my guns hum like an assaultron head at the moment--and I just tried an extremely clean re-install).*italics*  And the game mechanics (mat loss on death, grindy RNG for end game weapons/armor) combined nature of bugs makes them a lot less tolerable.
---
I'd feel a lot better if I hadn't paid full price at launch, and I'd very much like to be compensated for that.
---
Or at the very least, *italics*they should work on stability!*italics*
---
TBH, the infinite stash should have been offered to me for my trouble.  I'm paying for it.  But I'm a bit grumpy about it, and I don't think that's my fault.
---
I commend your efforts
---
I thought about saying it has a super low chance of detonating on impact...But I feel like people wouldn't enjoy that random occurrence as much since both the holder and attacker get vaporized and then does the ball respawn?  Where?  Would it be fun?  I don't think it'd be as fun as I initially thought.
---
I love Bethesda's quirky sense of humor and their unique story telling and I love that I'm playing with other players.
---
Haven’t played it, has it gotten better since release?
---
&gt;"An exploit was leaked about a month ago on an obscure forum. We discovered it, tested to make sure it was real, and reported it directly to the community managers."
---
Report it to them sure but to do the exploit themselves what did they expect would happen. They broke the Terms of Service. Sucks that this happened as that was a great resource for the game but the did the exploit themselves they kinda shot themselves in the foot there.
---
 Voted!
---
Putting 2 of the same gun in your fav wheel (say 2 lever actions) will eventually have one of them disappear from the wheel.  This is a returning bug.
---
For the scorchbeast use the fire resistant perk, it makes them less scary. They are of the last decent enemies we still have in the game. Please don’t get them nerfed
---
I use Whiskey for it's +2 strength bonus, with the right perk it becomes +6.
---
And Vodka, Cranberry Moonshine, and another Moonshine for the +25 hp since as a bloodied build my health jumps back up from any health boost being applied when it is low enough to do so. (So well fed's +25 hp boost, Vodka, Psychobuff all make my health bar jump up when I'm close to dying, doesn't work if I get hit hard enough to get downed once though).
---
Bourbon gives +1 End
---
Rum gives +1 Agi
---
Alcohol has it's uses but since most people can brew alcohol now it doesn't sell too well at all.
---
I tried to be a chem merchant on my first nurse character, all chems, all alcohol, healing supplies like salve, antibiotics, disease cures.  I was poor for a very long time until I got into the junk and legendaries business.
---
...Sounds like your character is...  Alcohaulin!
---
this doesn't sound crazy.  3 days old but not crazy
---
I think just about everyone has already decided to not pre order from them (and from anyone in some cases) again. I know I don't plan on pre-ordering anything until I know I'll like it.
---
I'm intrigued by this data because it can only be used to prove that Fallout 1st is being sold, not the other way around. If there is an unexpectedly high amount of subscribers shown by this poll, then it hints that there's a silent majority. If all the data points towards no subscribers, then its just this subreddit being biased.

This is NW

What about I dunno maybe having a paintball area for an event. No kills and just single hit knockout. The gun is already there...

I’ve gotten the Responder fireman outfit from Tea Time.  I’ve gotten another and a forest camo jumpsuit from the main quest line in Flatwoods on alts.  Not the regular fireman outfit, the rare one.  Given that I’ve made six characters (deleted one) and got two very rare outfits with two different characters while progressing through Flatwoods, my luck is either extraordinary or the drop rates are much higher for the main quests. I’m inclined to believe the drop rate is increased.

Strange Brew has given me hatchet electro fusion and barbed pitchfork plans.

I got a tomahawk plan from Back on the Beat this weekend. My character was leveled in the low to mid 20s, if level makes a difference.

I got the leather coat from Heart of the Swamp on my main character, who was around lvl 290 at the time. A couple days later the same character got the shielded casual plan from Queen of the Hunt.

I can verify most of these with screen shots.
---
It wont let me give you karma lol
---
I've noticed during my usual bobblehead and magazine farming route around Pleasant Valley Station on a friend's private server that they NEVER spawn.
---
Also noticed PA frames are super rare too...
---
Dart Gun
---
Ahh you’re right, that’s awful but definitely on purpose! 
---
Reminds me of a long time ago when the “recent” list on a server used to show people grayed out who weren’t on the server anymore. It was a great an easy way to know if a server was dead, they got rid of that at some point too :(
---
This is an exercise in futility. 
---
The simple fact is that less than .1% of the total players who have every played the game will see this and respond to it. You have a cascading filter effect trying to weigh in on something you have zero ability to cross verify. Their comment alone is subjective, they are seeing good numbers but what does that mean. You might interpret this incorrectly. You might say "well it might give some idea" but it doesn't, first you are asking on subs that are largely for the game most who hate Bethesda or the game are gone. Either way the turn out will be so low the results are naturally skewed.
---
Lately, you are losing people to the poor execution of this second post.  You are talking only to to the people who already know what this post is about not the people who have no clue and likely are to dismiss the post all together.
---
There are never stupid questions only stupid answers.
---
Was a glitch involving blueprints that's been patched out
---
I'd add a sugar crash effect afterward, like being a Junkie who isn't on their chem but not as harsh.
---
Variants maybe? Like from the atomic shop?
---
NIRA is one of the places where a random SB can spawn
---
there doesnt need to be a fissure site nearby

you should move

Those are rookie numbers buddy
---
What do you need 52 vending machines for lol
---
Thinking their ganedesign choices through isn't their strong suit...
---
Exactly, and after a while too you run out of things to do in game, collecting becomes second nature
---
It's very evident that Bethesda cares little for the pc community. Furthermore, I highly doubt we'll see any bethesda replys to this post because they know whats going on but are too complacent to do anything.
---
Yes thanks, and a suit of power armour to help with the heavy lifting
---
I’m surprised there isn’t a max level board somewhere for each platform. Would have probably driven some more people to stick around.
---
Is there info on that map yet?
---
I’d prefer any map be outside of the forest completely.  All the zones are really well done and I think they all would make for great map or two.  Except maybe the divide.
---
I have been told that the animal prefix does affect scorch beasts. What I haven't been told or don't know for sureis if the zealots also affects scorch beasts Queen's?
---
 I made myself a zealots prime handmade and was wondering if it actually does help against the SBQ.
---
 There's no doubt that helps against the ads that come during the SBQ fight but I would also like it to help with the Queen herself.
---
Pipe counts as both (with stacking effects!)
---
everything else is a commando weapon
---
I want to see how Wastelanders is before I decide to subscribe or not.
---
You could for the sake of fair play get rid of all the extra machines. You won't be rewarded except for theGood feeling you get knowing you did something right.
---
Oops! Thanks. I got a bit excited...
---
TL;DR the results will be as useful as tits on a chicken.
---
Launched my first Nuke on a private server last week solo. Xbox One X. No glitches in silo. No crash. Nothing. Only that most ghouls in Whitespring where dead. But was able to farm flux for an hour till I went to bed. Everything was fine.
---
Most of the weapons from gun Runner's arsenal. The Pancor Jackhammer, Desert Eagle, Grease Gun, M1 Garand.
---
My bad. I use the creature crusher to do 100% more damage to creatures though.
---
The first time I had an account wrending Problem in an MMO the call center, likely structured like you say, immediately escalated to the devs. 
---
If they’re not forwarding you to people who can help then they’re told not to, or there is no one.
---
Oh i just got a bloodied meathook.  What should i ask for it.  Its 2 star but only 35th level
---
Thanks for this comment, one of the few in this thread that actually knows what they are talking about. I'm one of the people that OP is talking about (and misrepresenting).
---
...so many motion assist servo plans.  I’ve done over 1200 outside the forest and I’m still 6 plans short of the full base set of 45, raider, 51b, 60 armor.
---
Maybe there were not enough reports to raise awareness :)
---
I want one tooo. 😲
---
Oooo nice. I'd love some high rise shoot outs
---
😂
---
My understanding is that the plan doesn’t exist.
---
Hunters and Zealots work on the queen
---
Two shot is a below average prefix. Look for a gun with a better prefix.
---
Sure. Farm rentals are an extra $10 per month.
---
Oh really :/ and howd you come to understand this?
---
Thanks everyone for your help
---
I really ought to update my game and do this, just for shites und giggles.
---
Data mining and the fact that a bunch of people have made this same post.
---
I love thoroughness and such attentive to detail here!  I'll have to pin this so I can collecting get through it!  Cheers for this really much so appreciated mate!
---
Well fuck
---
I heard that they data mined it, and they never implemented them.
---
I hope he'll find you. You're really kind for doing this, I think many players would Just keep it.
---
That is good to know but I wish there was somewhere in game to see the stats of what all these prefixes do in game.
---
So destiny has limited storage and tbat is in the same bracket? Guild wars 1 had about the same amount of people as well.and that had limited storage
---
I have exercised my democratic right.
---
You work for Xbox?
---
Oh I forgot the rabbits! It would be a little too exploitative but I think they could make it so more rabbits spawned as the play session went on. Would be funny Fallout humor lol
---
didn’t read but upvoted because you put time into it gg
---
Huh.
---
Good for them but sad for me then.
---
Danke!
---
Dude you should use the data to make an app. The game is lacking a good companion app! Do something with it!
---
Out of curiosity, where did you "find" the mask?
---
Junk sells better?
---
That makes no sense. Server resources arent the reason, if i recall it was in beta and unlike nuclear winter which was popular so they kept it throught the entire process it flopped. So now it will be in closed beta til it relaunches.
---
They have two of the tnt bunkers which are exactly this. I have been hopping they would add in more silent quests to open up the other ones.
---
So you're helping us find exploits?....
---
*Banned For Cheating!*
---
Lol on here, I guess “find” wasn’t the right word, cost me 8k caps...
---
Rad Ant Ale will always sell, and Nuka-shine too, for uncrafted booze whiskey give a good str boost and bourbon is needed for a few recipes...
---
no, because Bethesda needs to focus on making this game work like a typical FO game. 
---
i love some pvp but really that isn’t what’s going on for most players.
---
I think survival servers are now private servers.
---
I didn't know Fallout 76 had an alias.
---
If I buy ES6, it'll be an already used copy for me. Seriously considering getting FO4 for PC so I can mod it better, but first need to see if it's available used. Unfortunately, it also means I need to buy an external disk reader since my gaming laptop hasn't got a CD drive.
---
You know the games bad when the shill posts are as pathetic as this.
---
Hey mate, I loved your work there.
---
I'm also a big fan of games applied science haha.
---
I might have lots of pictures of the forbidden knowledge rewards, but they might be outdated. Anyways, I'll try to take pictures of every event I do from now on to help your research.
---
Cheers!
---
The cheats have actually been getting worse recently due to people posting code on how to do a lot of these things on public facing forums.
---
That's the douchenozzle. He was on last night doing the same damn thing. I reported him. I hope he gets banned.
---
No. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy 76 but the camp building is really limiting. 
---
I would go more into detail but you already have a bad opinion of the game. I think just by saying if you're only interested in it for building you'll be disappointed is enough.
---
Queen of the Hunt is still fucking bugged.
---
Hell no, I throw out fallout 76 for the collection bundel.
---
And I believe we should call them out. Regular people, or people that have been asshats, I get it, they don't need to be called out. But cheaters... what are we doing but helping them hide if we don't know who they are. Most people move onto the next game, they dont stay and see some "person" cheating. Rule 9 is for non cheaters. We should be able to tell our fellow dwellers, if M is in your match... he will cheat. Be forewarned. Shame them. Ban them. Make NW a better place for the pvpers. If you have to cheat at NW... thats sad... your sad...
---
No, I have brain cells that actually work.
---
More than most BBB titles tbh.
---
\*Eats popcorn as you reach to sacrifice the third goat\*
---
As I understand it, they're in the game coding but they cant be rewarded for the event. So theres not legitimate way to get them right now
---
Oh I mean NW.
---
Sort of like that.
---
 All pvp needs vats disabled really. I would say build wouldn't really matter since it wouldnt be damage based. They could use the pipe rifle paintball gun already around or maybe something with slower fire.
---
No sorry, I need to hear the foot steps, gun fire, and oomphs that might happen if im by the stone.
---
I have an extra pirate hat on PS4 if you still need that.
---
With the current climate and still smoldering uproar over patch 14, I don’t think an open online poll will present an accurate aggregate.  The very angry and very devoted ends of the bell curve will be disproportionately inclined to skew the results to their liking, leaving Joe Average underrepresented because frankly he/she has better things to do, like playing the game. With emotions running hot, there’s still a sociological and ideological interest to vote inaccurately.
---
The data is more likely to show current public opinion of the game rather than what the poll is actually about.
---
Only Bethesda’s sales data over the next quarter will present an accurate picture, and I’m certain they will react to those numbers whatever the results are.
---
Im not taking a stance either way, and have no interest in arguing about the same tired shit.  I’m only offering food for thought.
---
Also, for me the Highschool is the best place for collecting plastic!
---
How much?
---
I'm not sure what the current go for prices are, been sitting at max caps and no one is selling anything I want to buy armor and weapons wise.
---
My nurse is setup in the Toxic Valley on a Junk and Lead spot, so I'd sell bulk junk super cheap.
---
20 caps for Lead, Copper, Aluminum, Acid, Oil, Rubber, and Gears
---
15 caps for steel, 10 for wood
---
For scrap I'd do 1-2 for silver and gold, 8 for ballistic fiber scraps, 1 for black titanium, 5 for nuclear waste and ultracite scrap, 1 for antiseptic.  Bobbypins for 1 cap each, same with excess gun powder.
---
That got her pretty close to the then 25k max cap limit after two weeks starting at 5k caps.
---
My current character is on the junk spot south of Pleasant Valley Station and the main income came from selling legendaries, junk, ammo, magazines, bobbleheads, plans, and treasure maps.
---
All ammo I sell for 1 cap per, I drop missiles and mininukes and 40mm grenades and .50 caliber ball, and syringer ammo in front of my vendor for free.
---
Mags and bobbleheads anywhere from 100-200 caps and if they don't sell lower them as low as 50.
---
Treasure maps 50-75
---
Plans anywhere from 25-250, but if I'm overloaded with them I do a bulk sell for 19 caps each to get rid of them faster.
---
Legendaries I rarely sell lower than 250, usually try to stay within 1k for 2 stars, and only once sold a quad 3 star weapon for 10k, but legendaries vary greatly on price, I use the market76 subreddit to gauge an idea on what legendaries and weapons go for how much.
---
I actually got around 40k caps in like three days at one point and burnt around 30k of them on vendor plans like X-01 mods, camp items, and weapon and armor plans, and here I am at max caps again so obviously legendary farming plus passive loot bulking and selling worked out for me.
---
Additionally I would clear out my 1400 caps from the train station vendors by bulking excess junk like cloth, rubber, glass, cork, and such and taking out single scrap like fiberglass spool, crystal, asbestos, and sell them to the vendor on top of excess chems, purified water, glowing blood, glowing meat steaks, and such.
---
A lot of otherwise useless junk can be sold when bulked and junk with any cap value above 0 can be sold to the vendor, junk that can be bulked that has a 0 value needs to be bulked to be sold to the vendors.
---
I get my plastic from collecting golf balls and golf clubs around Whitesprings Resort and Golf Club, but scissors, enamel buckets, antifreeze and whatnot also provides towards my plastic.  I also never bulk plastic as you're losing out on 2 plastic per bulk and considering how much bulked junk gets me I'd have to sell individual plastic scrap for around 12 caps each to get back what I would from just bulking and selling junk to the vendor.
---
You just wrote one of those strategy guide books.
---
Least he could do would be open source the information. Hes the one that took the website down not bethesda. Hopefully someone out there pulled the data off at some point and we can just rehost his work.
---
Kind of hard to fuck it up:
---
    state = 2862933555777941757 * state + 3037000493
---
plus a few fiddles and you're done.
---
No wonder the pirate suite sold fast at 300 caps lol
---
You speak for everyone?
---
Rather than investing 9 points in rifleman or commando, invest 3.  You only lose 20% damage, and it allows you more points for long shot/concentrated fire/ground pounder/glow sight.  And long shot does increase long range damage so it's worth it.  Melee won't be doing much damage without a lot of strength/mutations.  Unfortunately the melee mutations don't work well with sniping.   Crits and sneak bonuses are key to doing lots of damage with rifles, so you will need some agility and luck.  The bonuses from sneaks massively outscale all other damage bonuses, so max out agility at 15 and get good armor to sneak with, chameleon or unyeilding with sneak bonuses from mods or legendary attributes.
---
 If you insist on doing melee (which isn't necessary with a good rifle and build), 7 points in perception is a good minimum  (need concentrated fire to get vats headshots and tank killer/long shot for dmg increase).  That leaves you more points for strength.
---
You will want a Guass, lever, or a handmade, bloodied or junkies if you don't like being super low hp.  Adrenal reaction mutation is also a must.
---
For builds like this, it's really nice to have 4 charisma for lone wanderer perk.  The rest of your points will be split up between endurance, intelligence, or luck to your preference
---
I know nothing about NW, but try a “scan and fix” from the launcher. That fixes it if you have the issue in Adventure mode.
---
Yep.
---
For me, it was cause I had to click "install" before playing (again) but as soon as it loaded up and I chose NW, it said I had modified files. A bit annoying and waste of search time. Late at night so searching for a game always takes longer anyways.
---
Votes
---
Fireproof helps a lot.  Under endurance
---
Sounds like some files a missing from your game files. Try using the scan &amp; fix option. 
---
When it comes to nuclear winter. Bethesda does a game file check to see if your game files match that of the original game. Otherwise you get kicked out. Missing game files or modding your game can cause this. As for hackers. They use third party software that runs on top of the game. Manipulating game memory to do what they want it to. Hackers don't touch their game files at all which is why you see a lot of them in Nuclear Winter. Bethesda needs to add a anti cheat system. Not just a game files check.
---
Found green hood a couple days ago in a locker in downstairs room in whitespring golf club, where the wendigo or glowing 1 always spawns. Might need a server with nothing looted yet though don't remember seeing it other million times I was there lol.
---
It only happened once and even without clicking out of the main menu and back into another game, I was fine. Just seems the flags for cheaters doesnt rven make sense
---
I sold those at 20 a piece for the longest time and they would sell pretty good. I just recently jacked up the price to 50 and they still sell
---
How we know all you people complaining are just assholes. Or dont even play the game. You just resort to calling anyone who enjoys the game names. Gotta love outrage culture shouldnt you guys still be harrasing blizzard?
---
Fireproof 3, and a dense chest mod will negate 95% of any explosive dmg.
---
Or just pull out the old ban hammer and go to town. Some peeps are obvi using moded out controllers on PS4 but PC sounds downright unbearable.
---
Brawndo has electrolytes.
---
20% of the mathematicians did the work.
---
Okay, cool. Thx!
---
Indeed, meanwhile boo-fuckin-hoo - I'm going to scuttle all my hard work because I'm mad at Bethesda. Who get's harmed here?  Not BGS I can assure you.
---
„So we get a finished product“ .... oh sweet sweet summer child. 
---
I don’t know how it will be handled but one can dream: raiders faction at top of the world worshipping Rose, responders village in Morgantown, some howbows in Grafton, an California Expedition of the BoS arriving in the Bog, MODUS still trying to „fix“ things from Whitespring, the Overseer will play a role too. All will have a own storyline with a decent story + radiant quests to gain reputation so every faction grant some unique rewards. The typical story DLC stuff. Oh and of course some more coop Raids in caves, castles and old Vaults.... one can dream.
---
Well, I asked him about that and what he told me is he found two functions with "seed" in the name.  All random number packages contain a function with "seed" in the name, that's how you set the seed.
---
As I've explained elsewhere repeatedly with any normal PRNG setting the seed does not change the distribution of results from the PRNG, merely the sequence of results generated, and in any game with unpredictable player input which of these results are used for which game value is impossible to predict.
---
Banning people on PC has almost no value as people buy game keys online for dirt cheap. You wanna know just how damn easy it is to cheat on PC? You can download cheat engine on PC and just check a box on it to increase the speed of your game. Giving you "speed hacks". It is insane. Why they haven't taken a league of legends approach by just "game crash" if it sees the cheat engine. PC is just broken.
---
No argument from me here, I just think if they want to attract more players they should cater towards all the people who enjoyed the pvp aspect of the game at *some* point.
---
I agree.
---
I highly doubt it that not enough player's have reported this specific 350 lvl guy .
---
The problem with him is that he is using his aimbot in a smart way and it is very hard to catch a good video proof of that . So i just nuke him and he disconnect's :) 
---
And yes it is possible to record an aimbot . 
---
Just play the video in slow motion and you can clearly see 2 shots to the head (no armor damage at all) ,the weapon is pointed at some random direction (an automatic one!) , while you are jumping . And i would  love to say they are lucky or just that good ... but it repeats itself time after time after time and the cheater is ending up with 20 kills literally each round . Nobody is that good! We are human and we have bad days ... an aimbot doesnt!
---
Key words should get it lol. I did sbq about 50 times have ALL prime receivers but still no shower. And encryptid about 20 ended up buying fixer plan. Maybe some bugs in the game?? 😂
---
I recall they said they'd revisit survival servers after Wastelanders comes out, I'm hoping they'll do more and give the players that wanna pvp more structured pvp options.
---
I’ve got a full set of marine UnySentAP. All matching pieces. I’m all set :D
---
They need to give me my damn keg plan before they even THINK of giving biv a bigger loot pool 😪
---
Sweet, I have that for bloodied.
---
Hmm, sounds fair.
---
Why is the gun so angry, because it misses it’s owner?
---
Sweet!
---
I like the idea of Pioneer Scouts but it was added way too late.  If you played from the beginning, you basically had to redo things on purpose just to get badges.  It was also super buggy. I don't know how many times, I had to modify my camera (up or down) for the pics to start working. At one point my photo gallery was just a bunch of dead rabbit pictures to try to get that action to register.
---
Even if you played from the beginning, it also seems mismatched to what level you are at.  The Possum patches (which are after tadpole) ask you to plant crops, make generators and turrets, etc.  I did all of that very early in the game.  Do you expect me to scrap it and redo it for patch?  Some of the patches gave credit for earlier activities but most didn't - so frustrating (but similar to the game).  
---
TL DR: An interesting idea but launched too late for original players and doesn't match the game play speed for all other players.
---
Nuke me daddy.
---
I wouldn't mind these pvp game modes with disabled vats, but considering some people love vats builds I didn't want to exclude them.  Was trying to catch everyone's fancy, you know?
---
Still I really like the idea of customized game modes that only give you one loadout, disables vats, and highly depends on players skill levels.  It'd probably be a popular game mode akin to SWAT in Halo.
---
Glad im not the only one lol.
---
Yeah I stopped playing as well. Just boring and while I actually really enjoyed NW.. even more than say Apex, the cheating thing ruined it.
---
Bethesda probably doesn’t know how to have two maps going in rotation at once
---
I've done Play Time a fair amount of times' and have gotten various Mentats recipes as a drop
---
They just needed to disable PvP vats, remove Tesla shoot at ground and hit everything even cloaked and it would be infinitely more palatable.  The damage cap was great and made fights actually fun-ER, but instant deaths by vats high dps weapons like aim bots just killed it for me.  
---
As a melee i didn’t stand much chance but I had moments of absolute chaotic fun where I was fighting ranged players without instant death on more even ground.  Also bring back real sentinel or cavalier armor effects of old to at least allow me to not die in 3 microseconds against those meta builds. 
---
With subscribers now they should be able to actually hire full time developers and add a couple designers to actually fix PvP balance issues quickly and creatively in adventure/survival and other modes instead of probably hiring overseas contractors for sprints that get like one fix every damn quarter and reintroduce 15 old bugs.  
---
Bet you 1 lb per Bobby pin comes back next patch or infinistash with artillery box, fug yeaaaa!!
---
I said it on the last post but I'll say it here as well, you should post another poll on the official forums and see what kind of responses you get there and then we can compare the two.
---
Please do so I can lure a bunch of ghouls to the table of exposed butt cracks and watch them all getting mauled to death and then take the little baggies.
---
@mods! This post right here!
---
bruh
---
How mouch exp? 200 points?
---
I won’t spend another atom before they fix jetpack and fast travel.
---
Good luck bud. I hope this gets sorted for you.
---
Yeah, I also need an option "No, but I want to when it'll become cheaper/better".
---
No not that one. This will likely not be fixed and still available. Its jst a template building they they use the same outside around the map but different inside layouts. Its not totally cheating because it could happen in real life.
---
Well i guess they could just add a door and turn it into a narrow closet but its a cbin.
---
The Plasma Pistol
---
In Soviet Russia, gun mad at YOU!
---
They are probably going to release wastelanders then stop content production. Leave the game idle for a year from fo1st release so they can't get sued for refunds then shut the whole thing down. They've given up. A live service game was way out of BGS league. They hardly event updated the single player games beyond the creation club updates and DLCs. Modders fixed all the bugs on previous games.
---
Fake outrage? You mean banning somebody who was trying to help them doesn't deserve any outrage?
---
I've made a post asking Bethesda just that, maybe check it out, the more people agree, the higher the chances Bethesda takes notice. I hope.
---

I got the shorts 😊 I think I got everything sept the empty pumpkin rack. 🤔
---
bruuuuuuuuh
---
Excellent, that’s one I still need more data on. Really glad they fixed its trigger.
---
lol not quite that detailed, but thanks!
---
I got everything I wanted except for the empty pumpkin rack. If I get another suit I'll let you know. If you're on PS4, and if you still need it.
---
&gt;We discovered it, ***tested*** to make sure it was real, and reported it directly to the community managers...
---
Could this be where things went terribly wrong? Reiterating, you said (paraphrasing) that you 'found an exploit on an obscure forum, tested it's validity ***then*** reported it to Bethesda', yes? 
---
If that's the case would this not be a self-inflicted wound? 
---
Playing Devil's Advocate here: Let's assume you found the dev room exploit (or one just like it) where Beth's policy is to ban anyone &amp; everyone that exploits/enters the room. Curiosity gets the better of you and you go inside and snoop around then report it to Bethesda as a good Samaritan then you get banned for all your efforts. You have every right to be upset but on the flip side does Bethesda not have the right to flex that ban hammer too? Could you blame Beth for initially banning everyone that entered the room regardless of intention no questions asked then sort it out later? 
---
I don't know if this the case for you however it seems like you're perhaps walking a fine edge and one that mirrors the same actions as cheaters/exploiters even though that doesn't appear to be what you're doing. The risk in testing exploits that cheaters use in an unofficial capacity is that you run the risk of looking like one yourself then getting caught in the mix with bad company unless Bethesda knows who you are and that you have good intentions. 
---
It looks like your work with map76 speaks volumes to your positive contribution to the community. However, I am unsure how that absolves you 100% from accessing an exploit unrelated to map76 without proper safeguards and getting consequences? I'll happily give you the benefit of the doubt that your intentions are noble but again, it's the fine line to walk shadowing the footsteps of cheaters, yeah? It puts you at the mercy of Bethesda and without the proper safeguards in place to protect you when they swing the ban hammer, things get sloppy real fast. Now, you're probably the hero this community needs to find and squash some major bugs and exploits and if that is the case then surely it sucks to be caught in this quandary. It could also be a blessing in disguise in that once you clear the air, you could continue with your work. 
---
Hit us up with more detail. Personally I can't necessarily put 100% of the blame on you as it appears Bethesda has not responded to your multiple attempts to reach out out. However, I  can't yet put Bethesda out to pasture on this one either if indeed they're just doing what they said they're gonna do to anyone using an exploit regardless of their intent. Moving forward, take a closer look at the order of your actions here and examine if there was anything you could have done differently.
---
Oof, I lack the dev knowledge/experience to make an app. But like I said, I’m still hoping to apply some of this knowledge to the existing game wiki(s?) out there.
---
...okay I can see how you got there but no, not quite.
---
Morrowind was full of bugs.
---
Each patch brought new ones just like now.
---
The difference is that Morrowind had community made mods that fixes the bugs for us.
---
I think its just a bug, I saw this masaage few times but next time I connecting its gone.
---
Thanks! I’ll admit to way too much time obsessing over this writeup.
---
Thank you! Any extra help would be invaluable, and like I said, even incomplete screenshots can be helpful.
---
Happy to help! Hope it’s a good read for ya!
---
I got everything sept the empty pumpkin rack. 😊
---
Don't gave up we can make a change.
---
Itd not so complicated to integrate anti cheat engine into the game. Many game has that build in. Bethesda can use one also. It may not slove all the cheaters but big portions of them for sure.
---
I’ve had two play sessions on a private server and it has been smooth as silk...like scarily so.
---
It’s a single player game engine with multiplayer code tacked on the side....the base engine is still only built to account for the actions of actual player character.
---
Day breaks pretty good.
---
That would be amazing, I still lack any sort of confirmation on the shielded casual plan.
---
&gt;Man, I really don't want to sound like a hater or a cynic.
---
Considering the state of this shit, being a hater and a cynic is the only proper way to be about this ...
---
Thanks! And yeah, some of the dailies are really fun, in my opinion. If nothing else they’re charming AF.

Dude your the real mvp. I'll drink one to you tonight.

I saw the Hunter Orange Vest in game for the first time in game today, apparently it released while I wasn’t playing. I sure hope it comes back.
---
It's not technically automatic. It's still a manual process, thus not violating any rules.
---
I just have you tagged as ["downvote me"](https://i.imgur.com/4q6jojt.png) - I've only done this a few times and it's always in such a circumstance where you said something REALLY messed up. Sadly, I don't remember what it was off the top of my head.
---
I can really see why I did it though, reading your comments in the thread... You may not realize this but your tone comes off as sounding entitled, accusatory, and as a gigantic apologist of Bethesda. You are throwing accusations, which are likely baseless, on someone who has helped keep this community alive since the beginning. It would be different if there was evidence, but "giving multiple excuses" is a serious bad faith argument in favor of someone's guilt.  
---
I hope that you can come to understand some different perspectives: Gaslighting others for the sake of your own pain may feel good in the short term, but it harms the community in the long term. In this particular case you're assuming the worst about a respected member of the community that has helped countless others. Throwing such ire at someone who spent so much time helping others will hurt us all in the end. It will make others not want to help in the future AND it will make others, like myself potentially, automatically assume you're being "a nasty person as usual" - This can (and has in the past) caused somenot read your comments and to just to downvote whenever you say. While this is technically not fair to you, it's how some have to cope sometimes in a sea of negativity.
---
I'm going to remove the tag reminding me to downvote you when I see you. I'm going to continue henceforth evaluating your posts individually without bias in your case in hopes that you can see things from the perspective of others.
---
I hope you have a good day.
---
Did I miss it?
---
A lot of the NW complaint threads get deleted by the mods
---
So if your infected penis got cured and somebody started advertising syphilis "now with mint flavour" you'd come back?
---
Well hate to break it to them but they are going to have to go much higher. Id pay 15k+ for it and still feel I got a good deal. Its a really low drop chance.
---
You would actually have to pay nearly 4x that amount to get the results
---
Nop
---
Harpers ferry was the 3rd mined "fullsize" map. I assume it will be the next one. Charleston had a smaller section, almost 1/3 of the other 3.
---
As far as im aware, no. I know you can find it in a storage dome thing (not much) and in the same place you can fine plans to convert it to use fusion cells (with some debuffs), but is been a while since i played and can't remember exact locations
---
\*doffs hat\* From one responder to another, that was brilliant work!
---
How -pray tell - the fuck does this game still habe players.
---
Bootlickers gotta bootlick my dude
---
Hail Gein!
---
welcome to the internet
---
I can build you an empty wooden stairs ;)
---
Use the forceful stock
---
Gad damn, theae Bethesda product shills are really putting in the effort right now.
---
Well initially they were doing it to free up resources for the instancing side of Wastelanders. Then Wastelanders went away and the paid service showed up.
---
Could be a possible solos with a smaller amount of people
---
This game has no testing. There is no closed beta.
---
I’m in the thick of my first ever semester of college and I haven’t played video games since August....I’ve never been more inspired by such detailed statistics and numbers. You have no idea how much I want to play FO76 now
---
Every 5% of health is 5% dmg i believe.
---
They'll make official wallhacks and aim bots for f1st subscribers. Boom! Solved
---
It was only bad because they thought we wanted elder scrolls warcraft. They're is absolutely no comparison to how bad fo76 is now and eso was on day one they are different studios too. But you'd figure Todd coward would talk to the other studios when building fo76 because together both online games. Sadly they didn't
---
&gt;gigantic apologist of Bethesda
---
How dare you sir! How dare you! You take that back!
---
Half way through this second vote and there’s only about 1/10 the number of comments and upvotes? The numbers have really depleted. You’ll probably end up with about 1/5 or less of the vote you got last time. Looks like a lot of people felt let down after the first vote.
---
well well well...
---
add me on psn, my username is the same as redditname and we shall negotiate
---
Nice. I got one but my random friend who gave me mad stuff has to get it he was grinding for it n couldnt get. I did get this orange Halloween riddler looking suit I enjoy
---
I have one but I am looking to trade for the longsuit
---
Understaffed, management is taking the revenue of original sales and fo1st to line executive pockets and corporate profits instead of staffing up support and dev teams.
---
Says a lot when they can just brag on this site and they get zero in-game repercussions for it. At this point Beth just seems to have given up on the cheaters.
---
Voted (again)
---
I was about to do the math on this for you, but I realized that I have the adrenal reaction mutation, which has a similar effect. Unfortunately, without knowing exactly how adrenal works, either, there's no way to figure out exactly what effect the bloodied legendary has.
---
If no one has provided a satisfactory answer by the time I wipe and selectively reapply my secondary character's mutations, I'll use her HP/damage to come up with something.
---
What seems obvious is that it's based on your current HP as a percentage of your maximum HP; that it scales continuously and not in non-trivial increments; and that it scales more dramatically at lower HP (for instance, having a greater effect when losing the 10% of health between 20% and 10% health than that between 90% and 80%), implying that some kind of exponential function
---
defines the effects. 
---
What I haven't investigated/worries about at all is whether the same function is used for all weapon types, whether the base weapon damage has an effect on the function itself (it obviously has an effect on the damage dealt), and whether the added damage is calculated from actual attack power or the weapon's base (unmodded) power.
---
And I've been a bloodied build since I got my first bloodied weapon!
---
Look closer at that thread and you'll see it's been removed by the mods. They continue to delete NW hacking complaints as soon as they notice them. It's not just Bethesda, it's the fallout 76 subreddit mods too.
---
Notice how the only options are one month, or the “better” deal that requires you to pay for a whole year. 
---
Few thousand people pay $100 upfront for basically nothing, that’s a lot of dough.
---
Yeah, I would do that; souns fun.
---
how long did it take you?
---
Not getting the decon shower plan from your first SBQ does, indeed, sound like a bug.
---
Not getting the Fixer plan after 20 Encryptid events is just your normal, everyday RNG being crap. The Fixer plan seems to have about a 10% drop chance. So a 20-long loosing streak would be about a 1:9 occurrence, i.e. one in every nine players needs to finish at least 20 Encryptid events to get those plans.
---
Im closing out and restarting more than anything that's for sure. Her lets get every player on the map all together blowing up cars that won't cause issues.
---
I have had the same experience, through out this whole week I'm over 13 times now and can't get the short pant suit. It pains me to think I could have had it, if Bethesda wasn't a joke.
---
i ended up with 2 pirate suits, 2 whitesprings jumpsuits, 3 short suits but not long suits!
---
 
---
I took everythink FO76 threw at me looked past alot of stuff but this last update and service just was a slap into the face of the loyal fans so complety uninstalled it.
---
This game is like that Crazy ex girlfriend just starts going nuts after you break up lol
---
That's great cheers mate :)
---
Hm, yeah, I can see the logic of not wanting to promote cheats or provide an avenue for people to get cheats, but something's got to give.
---
All part of the death and hearing impaired plus package for 129.99 a month or 1200 a year
---
Awesome work, it was a fun read. What legendaries are you talking about where Camden Park is concerned? Isn’t that just where you get the tokens? Or does completing those games sometime award legendaries and I just haven’t noticed?
---
Tbh I personally would keep the gun but you are doing the right thing. Good on you
---
Imagine if we had people doing this for better games
---
If you didn't already get it you're going to want the bos plan too! Think I eventually found it on vendor bot in Harper's ferry but was a long time ago...
---
afaik the damage increases with every 20% health missing so when your health hits 19.9 you'll do the most damage.
---
If you are on PC head on over to nexus and grab Improved Health Bars for QOL to get to the sweet spot.
---
Constant crash is not the reality for many people anymore, at least on PC... and it has been this way for some time.
---
... now, the monetization, that just got worse...
---
*fool proof
---
\&gt;implying a a studio doesn't care when they are likely working on bugs and glitches and Wastelanders  
---
\&gt;Throwing around the term "Blind fanboy"
---
1) Here is the video i have of the two of us "jumping" around (or rather, you standing there like a potato).
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqaNAdiT74k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqaNAdiT74k) 
---
2) But regardless, the burden of proof lies upon the one making the claim. You are making the claim that i aimbot, esp, etc. yet you have zero evidence to support your claim. However, I have supplied evidence to support my counter claim - a position that i do not technically need to support until you propose a reasonable amount of evidence in support of your claim. As such, the idea that you have "Caught me in spectator mode" is irrelevant and pointless, as you and the other like-minded plebes on this forum have yet to provide a SINGLE shred of evidence that points to the conclusion that I "hack." However, when it comes to ACTUAL aimbotters, I have compiled a fair amount of video evidence.
---
3) Also, yeah, i am going to come here and defend myself when a bunch of 2nd rates twats are tossing around lies and misinformation because they (you) are too stupid and unskilled to notice the difference between a talented player and a hacker.
---
The Havok engine would freak out from vehicles of any kind. This is why 3, 4, NV didn't have vehicles
---
10 DMG aiming is still not bad it's the second best prefix u can get on it then fire rate
---
The tents can be used in public worlds as well.
---
Thank god i stopped playing this game long ago
---
No, the tents can be used on public servers too.
---
I voted.
---
They said when Wastelanders releases, they'd put 76 on steam. So next year likely.
---
Do you mean the "Jack O'Lantern Short Suit"? If so, I should have one. 
---
IGN: Feiff
---
Luck of the draw 1 procs more often than 3. 
---
Automatic barrel and one of the stocks ( cant remember which one but it's the stock the old laser rifles had) keep mine going for awhile.
---
No that was definitely one shot, and it was definitely a ranged guy, no melee.
---
How does 1 do more then 3 mate? Cheers for the advice 😁
---
Thanks bro!
---
I think I had a spare to swap for the long pant suit if you still need it?
---
I've been here from the beginning and I can objectively say that meat week was the high point of this game and the events added since then have been less fun and more buggy and laggy and unstable. Did you ever hear a single person crash during the cookout? Lag during the prime cuts? People appreciate quality events and it doesn't mean we are asking for months of development for an event to be fun, just have it stable enough to participate in...
---
I'm on xbox. Wby?
---
Combat rifles recoil is allready pretty bad when full auto, add TS AND FFR and its gonna have some major kick.
---
Xbox, already did the obligatory pre-post stalking recon of your profile, lol
---
In a NW game atm, so I’ll need a few
---
Maybe not Rodgers reserve beer.  I think that was just one dude that made his own. Wouldn't make sense to have a sign.
---
Awesome man take your time. My GT is DarkWolfMist.
---
We're not full on with RP, but it's something that is encouraged. Keeping in uniform is expected but not enforced (you can't make people do things). 
---
And we have a rank structure and progression system. 
---
Feel free to check us out, but we may not be RP enough for you. Something we're open to exploring though.

Fireproof perk and dense mod is your friends!
---
1 procs more often but repairs a lesser degree while 3 repairs more but procs less. 
---
I ran level 3 for the longest and very rarely would it proc for me but after switching to 1 it seemed to proc at least 2 times a cartridge. 
---
That being said your still gonna be repairing fairly often, just a downside of using laser rifles, but I also only run level 2 gunsmith since I'm a bloodied build.
---
No, Daggerfall existed.
---
No problem:)
---
Made it to 3rd place like this.  A bunch of fools in Marine armor were swimming circles above me looking for me.  I was standing at the bottom in PA.  Fire pushed me up the bank though, had no stims and had to poke my head out.  Squad of Marines lit me up, rip.
---
Is Bethesda really to blame now if it takes over a year for some guy to realize Bethesda does not give a shit about Fallout 76? I mean, the "Every update introduces more bugs than are fixed. It is out of control and it is only getting worse" is a year old quote, it happened even while I was playing, and it does not seem to change, as a very dedicated player and even a creator of tools states himself. Yet, he goes on to purchase Fallout 1st membership (a year I would assume) already knowing everything about the game and Bethesda. And I am sure he was amongst those who were calling "quitters" haters, cynics, mindless sheep following reviewers, a part of a campaign against Bethesda, yadi yada.   
---
Now that he is no longer able to pretend the company and its game is alright, he has posted that and will be branded hater &amp; cynic quitter for it, will most likely never accept that those people who said his words year ago were actually true.
---
Weapons artisan is 3 IN perk, which repairs any weapon to 200% condition.
---
But not worth 10K lmao
---
The gaming community needs more people like you. Best of luck in your search bud, I hope you can find them.
---
Maybe add a gold, diamond, &amp; platinum to fallout 1st. $20 one time charge fee per tier, we can put your idea in tier 2, so only $40.
---
 [u/Ephesossh](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ephesossh/) You should crosspost this in /r/dataisbeautiful
---
The fallout first refund part is hilarious after zenimax just got taken to court for not offering refunds of this very game
---
I think that there should have been an option for I haven't bought Fallout 76 or I dont play Fallout 76 anymore. Because technically I should answer no on that poll, despite never playing the game at all.
---
I was on the fence about and was thinking of picking it up on sale this Christmas before this Fallout 1st thing happened. Now I feel I am just here to watch a train wreck of a beloved studio.
---
TIL: Martha Stewart plays Fallout 76
---
If he eats your shoes there will be 6 more weeks of winter!
---
You can plant tents in Adventure mode too
---
Happy cake day btw 🍰
---
This is one of reasons why I am waiting for real private servers (not that private seasion #@@$%) so modders can fix game for bethesda. Again...
---
Sorry I missed you. Stayed on until 2200 UK time after a blast doing mischief night. My tag is tallbaldbloke600
---
Well, I voted again. I would expect about half of active players took at least one month, from what I saw ingame.
---
It will be intresting how many have planned to keep using it.
---
In a way it is worse in VATS because it does not show the reduced accuracy numbers in the calculated percentage, so you always think you have a better chance to hit than you actually have.
---
I agree, this is exactly what I think they will do.
---
my 10mm smg and shotgun have vampire effect. i prefer it since i get so close to enemy’s. also helps with the vanguard armor pieces since your constantly pumping up health! in other words you’ll love it.
---
Encountered the “T-pose” bug the other day during the Protest March event in Grafton.
---
Some Melee strikes don’t register when striking Liberators or Schorched
---
Getting downed by an enemy and then pressing “Give Up” immediately after sometimes causes all nearby enemies to drop dead
---
Scorched corpses sometimes fall through the floor making them; 1) unlootable and 2) respawn in a static position that doesn’t take damage
---
My Xbox wasn't connected to the internet. I had dial-up until 2004. A difference is that Morrowind only had client side issues, and restarting the game didn't have the same implications of losing out on events and camp spots.
---
Do you mean that the function changing the damage changes every 20%? I hadn't thought of that. 
---
You're definitely not saying that it has a flat damage add that gets larger with each 20% of missing health, right? Because it doesn't do that.
---
Which is critical when you have cash flow shortages, financiers who backed the line of credit to get 76 made probably want their money paid back, atom shop and 1st is their only way to get cash flow going again because new copies just aren’t selling like they hoped. Can’t pay whichever office enough to do fixes and patch bugs, I think they will announce bad 4th quarter numbers end of December.
---
I'd like to see them on a weekly cycle. The vault raids swap weekly, it stands to reason thry could manage that with nuclear winter maps too.
---
Or they take your submission ideas and sell them back to you behind a paywall.
---
It's been alright for me, not as good as the past but I can get at least 5 2-3* enemies while running it. 
---
Personally I miss my Burrows runs, I'd walk out of there with at least 7 3*s (always crappy but it is what it is until they remove some of the terrible legendary perks)
---
Anybody on ps4 I have a bloodied ffr 50 dr gatling laser to sell! Normal not ultracite! 😂
---
I do, and by large margin. Bethesda should have wrote a new engine. Since they didn't do it now, there's sadly no chance they would do it for F5 or that new thing of which name I've forgotten already.
---
I voted again on the new poll.
---
I got one ill sell hit me up on psn bertlestien- with the -
---
If by broke you mean jump button immediately activates the jetpack instead of jumping, or makes character fly up into stratosphere? Yeah still broke I guess lol
---
On ps4
---
What are people's guesses as to the percentage of 1st subs?
---
I'm going with at least 20%.
---
Handguns in general need to not suck so fucking much
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
I have never made a bugreport for Bethesda. I don't have much faith in that. I don't complain that much of the bugs though.
---
Checking alt...
---
Could only find one on my main guy
---
I mean you know he means it why be like this?
---
Oh no, 15 junk
---
Nothing in my camp is locked,
---
If I’m away by the time I get back it will be restocked
---
It is mind-boggling that a lvl 350 cheater can run around after all the reporting.
---
about how long does it take? i will only be able to do this for a few hours on wednesday, friday, and sunday, so i want to see if its even worth my time.
---
It’s more of a novelty weapon. A fun gun. Unfortunate but just how it is for now. Personally I want the smg to get some love, give it a suppressor and reflex sights.
---
But that would just attract them to those game modes, then Beth would be essentially making two different games, well 3, since they already are with Nuclear Winter.
---
Duh?
---
Yes you can get a parking ticket too while some serial killer is on the loose. 
---
Deal with it.
---
I have done the event exactly 2 times, I have no idea what different rewards there is. How the hell should I have any idea..? 
---
Nevermind...
---
Alas, I was mistaken, no spare D:
---
Sorry, good luck
---
I dont think you onow how development wlrks. Of course they have testing. Just because they have bugs doesnt mean it's not tested.
---
Ahhh damn it's all good, thanks for looking.
---
Tbh, even if it was possible, the alienblaster is just garbage.
---
Why would I get a parking ticket for parking essentially legally and with no violations in sight?
---
This 100%
---
can I still get it?
---
This is the realist shit on the internet right now
---
*ground
---
Also use weapon artisan so you can repair it up to 200%. You can swapthat in and out when repairing weapons.
---
i'd like it.
---
I mean, yeah. Just. Clear it out and run along. Most people that don't lock it (Or their water purifiers) are perfectly A-OK with randoms taking whatever's in them if they need it.
---
Yo , did u steal my location /. I own hatters feery and my camp has been in this place for months ??! Did u ever see it or is it a great minds thing /.  Iv never had a “ your camp could not be placed “ alert - ever
---
Seriouisly doubt. You might get 2 star railway for decent 3 star AAE handmade.
---
Honestly, Im just glad they actually added in game drop instead of mtx.
---
\#1 and #3 need to be fixed before I even consider Fallout 1st.
---
Considering the massive hate bandwagon for this game, yes they definitely care enough to vote.
---
Ability to press Q is now a gaming skill lol.
---
Unfortunate life facts, right here.
---
Interesting, I have several chars and recently I've started thinking "You know.. that fast travel thing hasn't happened on this char"... one does definitely use unyielding armor so maybe it happens only on that one... hrm
---
As some others said, if I have to much junk, water or what ever I’m collecting from an extractor, I leave it open for people to take and use. Better for it to help someone else than sit around for me, also they fill pretty fast.
---
This explains why I can't even give away jet pack plans these days
---
Gota empty pumpkin rack?
---
Good video. 
---
I've always wondered why people call it stealth commando though since stealth is kinda always assumed and it's bloodied build so why it's always omitted.
---
Yes, right, and I'll just go and hand the invisibility cloak and the Marauder's Map in to old McGonagall as well, shall I?
---
Not that I've benefited from the glitch at all, since I didn't start playing the game again until long after the patch, but PFFFFT. That sounds like a TERRIBLE idea.
---
Churches are all crumbling in the Fallout since the war of 2077. We don't need to follow their doctrine any longer. The only 'good' feeling there is, is knowing that you're surviving better than any other survivors.
---
I got to second place today swimming in the lake. I thought I had it won but the circle closed to nothing and the guy swimming above me had a hazmat suit and some stimpacks. So he was able to outlive the storm a few seconds longer then me.
---
One dense mod is fine.
---
Someone found a ["Fancy Single Action Revolver"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/340255207898480640/640484544851476481/cMlu0jL.png) assumedly from the dev room. It has 50% more damage than the base variant.
---
I stick that in my punch bowl but no one uses punch bowls because they always expect it's nukashine
---
I'm wondering here why it doesn't show any difference between piercing, stringing and perforaring in regards to their penetration, as one of them should be best and has been in tests.
---
Everything else looks good.
---
The real question is can we craft them so theres a chance to get them to drop from the purveyor?
---
That is exactly what it looks like, squeezing the last drops of money from those that are delusional enough to stay before shutting everything down, firing everyone and salvaging the Austin studio for cash.
---
How much of this stuff is event exclusive? I realize it’s ending pretty much now. I managed to get a chunk of things but wondering how much I may be missing out on later.
---
Content. Quests, items, locations, factions, games, puzzles, instances, collectibles, trophies, achievements, sbq alternatives.. Keep the event timers and rotation but let lvl 50 or 100+ characters initiate quests like project paradise, uranium fever, AWOL armaments, campfire tales, etc.
---
what is the drop chance? i got it after first try of the event, i even bought the pirate hat from the atoms shop 
---
i also got the pumpkin suit, people keep trading me for it
---
lmao survey results behind a pay wall... we truly live in an era of petty greed
---
this is incredible
---
At this point getting banned from the game is a reward.   I say let him lord over the hell he is trapped in.
---
There are 3. But it’s not really sufficient. I want to get in a room and need to solve my way out. Or if I need to find 3 items, I don’t need the map telling me exactly where they are lol. Give me a proper hint and let me search.
---
A commentator with play-by-play announcing would be hilarious.
---
Buy it from my vendor for 976 a piece
---
Some raiders just appreciate some fresh meat
---
Auto correct I'm looking for the mods
---
With my current gear stealth is almost unbreakable. Why stealth commando... it just sounds really good much better then any other more descriptive name.
---
Bloodied melee isn’t much harder but being able to kill from a far is really helpful. Generally when I’m using melee i do not use stealth and rather sprint for kills. Melee is my choice for nuke zones as I can easily farm in hazmat suit this way.
---
I played it the other day and I don’t believe there was a cap on the damage.
---
Or an era of people who want to get paid for their services.
---
I hope you give us an update if you ever find him.
---
Lol memory manipulation to cheat. You'd think that in 2019 a developer would have the server capabilities to cross check for illegal manipulation of memory addresses. Unreal Tournament 2004 had better anti cheating software...
---
I hve never experienced this. You sure you aren’t wanted? Lol
---
Me personally haven't had the time to play (testweeks at my school) 
---
I still find the game fun and love to play it, just been to busy
---
It’s in beta... they are testing the maps
---
$384 for a dumb survey someone jury rigged together in javascript?
---
So you don’t even own the game? Why are you here?
---
hey it's me, your brother
---
Do you have a pirate hat?
---
I have the plans
---
Tents can be used in public worlds. Kinda lame IMO.
---
Are you PC or console?
---
I must admit, these are good addition to Fallout universe. Bethesda did some things right, that's for sure.
---
This guy talks about the fallout community paying an extra 100$ but mostly posts about GTA online, the game that (at this point) almost requires you to put real life money into the game to have the best experience. 
---
Yes we get charged extra but a lot less than what rockstar are wanting from there players
---
The other day I found a camp that you had to enter thro a wall using some sort of crafting trick and it was underground it was really cool first time I’d seen someone get realy crafty to build outside of playable area.
---
The plans are sold at the grafton station or bot.
---
actually the beta had 2 entirely free weekends.  to get all the beta weekends required a pre-order, but they had 2 free (in the us atleast)
---
Ever visit the Bolton Greens?
---
The Gourmands
---
I wonder can you trade the skins and costume or is it player specific
---
I know I got it for my gf and now she rarely uses.
---
It’s still in BETA.... lol. It’s not a graphical mistake. When they took survival off beta they announced it and changed the graphic. You are wrong. They even reiterated it was in beta when this map was introduced.
---
For me it was the bridge, that area and the campground led to some very interesting happenings. There wasn't just the risk of players or ai, there was also the risk of falling to your death if you didn't have power armour and I have seen it many times where I would shoot at an enemy and they would try and escape only to plummet to their demise.
---
I also agree. After wastelanders this game will die. How fast will depend on the quality of the DLC. Wastelanders WAS make-or-break, now it is "last chance to play something new". They will not communicate about it, they will just do it. Cause f\*ck the players, right?!
---
I got mine from the information drop quest at the training camp in the mire . Sorry I have a complete mental blanking names. Fort defiance isn't it
---
I know but personally 10k is a bit harsh. Ok longcoat that everyone wants 10-20k. Yes it's rare but to buy from the vendor it only like 600. A bit of a markup. Btw I got mine for 4k score
---
i have a idea! games fall under the rules, perks, loot drops as in nuke winter. so everyone spawns with pistols. the point is to hold and extract resources from the workshops over X amount of time of over all resources claimed. over the course of the match/round each workshop is nuked one at a time until the match ends.
---
Incompetent management. Trump level nitwits.
---
I totally understand. Honestly I dont care much for outfits and think everyone seems kinda greedy with markups in this game. I try myself to lower prices below.
---
There are  several reports from various players about certain players on PS4 who have a reputation of constantly lagging around. Don’t know what to chalk that up to.
---
I leave mine unlocked on purpose. I am paying for you to win hah. In all seriousness I never empty it so might as well let others enjoy.
---
Same. Hey want a bomber jacket whats the going rate 8-10k. 400 caps in a vendor
---
It really isn't in beta. They took the survival graphic off because they were removing survival. They don't care about changing the NW graphic because people are more interested in playing then focusing on an insignificant part of a graphic  that has no effect on the gameplay whatsoever.
---
The beta happened back in the first few weeks of launch when they let everyone play but intended to take it away after the free week. But due to overwhelming support they left it released to the public and since it's stayed in that state with no discernable differences besides a map change, it's safe to say it's no longer in beta. And also even if it was in beta, there's no reason they couldn't have both maps playable since both are playable and have been playable since their release so no further testing is necessary in that department.
---
Hey I’ve got the short pant suit if you want it, will trade for fireman outfit, or something if you don’t have that, I’m not looking to make a buck I’ll just never wear that suit lol. I’ll be on this afternoon EST or tomorrow. GT same as name
---
It is stil in BETA and they have only tested half of the four planned starting maps so far, when all 4 maps have been tested and works fine they will put it in rotation. Relax.
---
Lol. So when exactly did they announce his was out of beta? I’m done arguing with you. You are mistaken.
---
ikr, I live in Australia and now have legal rights to a refund. They just ignore me. Fuck em though I'm just gonna do a chargeback.
---
I do everytime I see it but the constant radio noise makes me turn it off after about 15 minutes
---
Really? I haven’t experienced this. Thanks for the answer :) my comment I guess is wrong
---
However the server stays up as long as one user has the sub. Else yes the timer starts.
---
oorrrrrrrrr you could just lay low and try to nab that top 10
---
They say alot of things. They said nothing but cosmetics in the way of microtransactions, they said that the burrows was an extremely difficult dungeon and many more things proven to be untrue. It's not my opinion if they aren't doing anything at all in the way of updating the game mode besides from very very minor bug fixes. Since the well of content has run dry for NW as of now, it's pretty safe to say it's in full release.
---
Yes, it's very irritating and many players I played with and died shortly after the event ends thought that someone stole their fluxes from the bag but it's just bug.
---
Aren’t they the ones who can tell you what stage of the development life cycle their product is in? Not you?
---
There is a final note that the server will stay up as long as one user has the sub even if that user is not the original owner of the server.
---
I don't know if the increase is linear or not, but it certainly is not a flat increase across weapons. And I didn't even hint at that.
---
What console you on ?ill come save ya if ya on ps4
---
That is not what makes it still in beta. The fact that the Developers say it is in BETA and the fact that the mode itself says BETA makes it BETA.
---
Well the product life cycle for NW is very much past the testing stage even if you are thinking iteratively since there hasn't been a new iteration of the game more with substantial change since Morgantown and therefore would be considered the final product with regards to the development life cycle for software systems
---
There are still 2 more maps to test.... you can be disappointed with the speed of development but to say it’s not in beta is just false.
---
hahaha I laughed harder on this than anything else this past month. Thanks bud.
---
The Developers who have said things before regarding the game that haven't been true, the developers who said they're working to fix the cheating issue with the game but there are still tons and tons of unpunished hackers and cheaters in Nuclear Winter. I wouldn't go by there word without the proof to back it up and a graphical panel isn't much in the way of proof.
---
They have this effect for consuming sugar.
---
What I'm hearing then is you don't join because you don't want to lose, to be perfectly honest. That's fair enough but don't make it sound like its about equal footing because everyone has a damage cap of 110, easily reached with crafted weapons. Only 1 person can win out of at least 4, the odds aren't in your favor. That doesn't mean anyone better than you at PvP must be spending money... I've had people square off on my with literally 0 regard for thinking on their toes. Like take one shot with their handmade and load, repeatedly instead of emptying a clip. Some people just don't have what it takes to PvP.
---
Not really because BGS thinks , Fortnite and Apex and OW are just competitive shooters with cosmetics and they want a piece of the pie. But their polish is far beyond anything BGS has ever done in their whole lifetime.
---
* Bad spelling
---
* Does not even play or own the game
---
* Does not understand that Fo76 can not be pirated
---
He can prove that within reason he has attempted to contact and resolve things with the company, consumer protection laws should be on his side!
---
Can't argue with that.  Still they got Nuclear Winter running halfway reliably, I think they can manage to tweak it into further various game modes without burning the entire game down from the inside out.
---
...Uh, no promises though, not with the current track record and all.
---
You bugger :D
---
Not for false advertising.. that has not been proven.

Lol but I definitely understand why people be mad.. but still.. its a money's world and we all gotta grind till we perish right lmao..
---
I'm just happy I never played it.
---
True &amp; I only hate the emote
---
Title says during, I missed the "after" in the main text (old eyeballs or too many beers, take your pick), so my bad... Either way he's keeping the Raider spirit alive and well :-)
---
That isnt gonna work, you are going to get tons of people saying "Its mine!" And stuff.
---
On another note.. looks like the us cancelled the Paris deal.. so maybe we'll be having a real fallout I a couple of years.. something to like forward too (not)
---
Yep, deleted for the specifics included. Point taken.

Yes I am.  [https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/misleading-claims-advertising/false-or-misleading-claims](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/misleading-claims-advertising/false-or-misleading-claims)

---
I don't know how many times I can explain that regardless of the ruling, I am still entitled to a refund on the basis of false advertising. Bethesda originally said atomic-shop items would be cosmetic ONLY, which is no longer the case. The ACCC link I have included directly states that statements made online by any business are applicable under false advertising.   
---
So yes, I am LEGALLY entitled to a refund.

None of the versus prefixes works on Sheepsquatches because they are marked as creatures, not animals.  [https://imgur.com/a/RM6eDFQ](https://imgur.com/a/RM6eDFQ)
---
I voted!
---
Patch 13? The numbers are out there.
---
Nah, no excuse when I fought lag all the way through a silo I’ve never explored before only to realize none of the silos has stashes at all. When I went to my stash and came back, the entire silo had reset. Wasted a huge chunk of my time, which was even more frustrating considering how laggy the entire silo was
---
Or get you banned.
---
I’ve never tried going to a train station, but the two times I’ve gone back to my camp before launch, the entire silo has reset right away. It’s why I spent 30+ min trying to find a hidden stash in the silo I was in...
---
That is irrelevant. it's still shipped with the product. Sure, I can choose not to buy it, but that doesn't mean its not false advertising. And as I said, atomic-shop items affect the game world for ALL players, so those gamechanging items still affect my game-world, regardless of whether I purchase them or not... Therefore the original experience being advertised was a lie, therefore... FALSE ADVERTISING.
---
Blaster with fusion cells is perfect for tagging and letting the other players get some loot.
---
I have an additional suggestion: budget has to be increased! I can't put all my lights and furniture i want, just because laggy server will break. It's outraging!
---
Zealot's Prime does 30%+35% = 65% more damage (vs scorchbeasts stack additively).
---
Furious Prime does 1.45 \* 1.35 = 96% more damage after the 9th shot
---
Executioner's Prime does 1.5 \* 1.35 = 103% more damage below 40% SBQ health
---
I didn’t think that there wouldn’t be stash boxes in a place that obviously needed them. It reeks of poor game design, forcing the player to redo everything just cause they don’t want to place a stash box in there.
---
Almost everything comes back eventually
---
I tried going back to my camp quickly and the silo reset itself. :(
---
I think the only thing that can be said for certain is that Wastelanders is absolutely pivotal as to whether or not Fallout 76 continues.
---
If it makes a ton of money, we probably get more content.
---
If it's a bit so-so or an absolute shit show, I'm all but certain that we're done. Like not even modest success would be enough I feel. It has to either be a smashing success or we're done.
---
&gt; they will quietly leave and start working on Starfield and ES:6. 
---
Nah, different teams. Starfield is already in a playable state and I would guess ES:6 is still in preproduction or very early on in production.
---
I would be VERY surprised if they let the BGS Austin team touch the main game. Maybe the Atom Store team as they've been absolutely smashing it but we've all seen what the core dev team at Austin is like.
---
This. There are like five enemies that can actually do damage to higher level characters, please don't need them. Mirelurk Queens especially are like mini bosses. They should be dangerous.
---
Great work!
---
As for Forbidden Knowledge, I've done this a few hundred times, so ...
---
"Drop rate for each seems to be below 5%, and the plans could be unknown-only drops."
---
I can confirm both points, and the paint plans are unknown-only and strictly drop in order, so you will be able to farm the plans you haven't learned yet. You can take my word for it, as I've hoarded 15 Officer paints and am near to 20 Paladin paints now. The hard choice? How many are enough, and when to move on to the next tier (I only have the Elder paint left). ;-)
---
Hope u find em
---
Doesn't matter. They advertised the game as only having cosmetic items in the atomic store. They went back on this promise and added game-play items. These gameplay items are used by other players in the game, which I can interact with in the game world. Therefore the atomic-store cannot be considered a seperate product, since it affects the base-game regardless of if the player chooses to purchase from it or not.
---
That's not how parody works
---
Definitely chase it up with ACCC again. There can be further fines or go to court with non-compliance.
---
I wouldn't even wait. 4 days turnaround for a response is bullshit. 1 or 2 maybe but not 4.
---
Hi
---
The main goal is for the build to be  “fun” for you.
---
It’s usable and seems to be a hybrid  build.  It’s not min/maxed.
---
In order to give advice, we need to have more information on your play style.  For example:
---
- solo or team play
---
- PVE or PVP
---
- preference for melee or ranged
---
- stationary (sniper) or mobile (commando)
---
- heavy weapons / rifles / pistols
---
Alright I luckily have off today so I'll let you know fairly soon I just woke up
---
I typed it in wrong the second time and didn't have another card. Went to get another card and server crashed . Good times.
---
Sounds like a plan then, 4 days is an insult of a wait. And considering I've made an effort to reach out on social media, it can't be chalked up to wait-times.
---
Whoa, hey man thanks for that lol. I won't call you the biggest astroturfer, since you used to play and all plus it seems p rude my guy. Btw, how many playthroughs did you go through of Outerworlds before getting bored?
---
I believe I have a set that I can sell him and 5k sounds good to me.my PSN is damian_13_666 but I'm at work for the next 9 hours. Send me an add and I'll accept it when I get online
---
I am just stating facts here. You would have to test this in court. No need to shout.
---
Thank you for your courage
---
You will see a flat incrase of 10% rifle damage if you instead do 1 of each rifleman perk instead of 3 in one.
---
Cancel culture at its finest.
---
Amazon was originally advertised as a book store, then they started selling different products. It’s the same thing.  What you are accusing them of would need to be tested in the courts because on the merits it’s not as simple as you claim it to be, no matter how much you scream and shout. I’m just stating facts, I don’t know why you are getting so angry at me. You are laying out your argument, and it is up to the courts to decide if that is false advertising.
---
level up some more, no point in levels if you can take everything head on early in the game. Put in the time.
---
As somebody already mentioned the plans are available from the Grafton Station and they are only like 150 caps.
---
Haha that’s awesome
---
Have updated it :) if more infos needed just tell me. And thank you already for the help :)
---
"oh yeah lets put a stash in an instance" that's like wanting a banker in a dungeon in a mmorpg...
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
No Im not, i was wanted like a few months ago but got killed
---
I've suggested it before. With legendary perks being promised, there's opportunity abound for weapon imbalance to be fixed.  For revolvers and revolvers only, I suggest introducing a perk to burst fire, similar to how competitive cowboy-action shooters fan the hammer to fire as fast as possible.  Reload speed will remain the single action's downfall I'm sure, but it sure would be nice to be able to put that 3star revolver to use vs anything over level 30.
---
I locked the terminal so somebody can't switch between junk and scrap but the actual collector bin is open. I also have a junk collector in my camp that is open too.
---
If you subbed and have been hunted to rage quit, then good.
---
Everyone playing the game should be ashamed and anyone still spending money on that shite deserves to be driven from the game.
---
It was a recent add, maybe around patch 12? Used to only be able to get them from drops before
---
Plus the game tells you the only places with stash are red rockets and train station. They added also the enclave bunker. But any of these place are "dungeons".
---
Just could unlock now. Changed it with a lockpick skill (can change if needed)
---
I guess we can only wait and see.
---
And yeah, you are probably right. If I was on another Bethesda team, I wouldn't let the Austin guys touch anything I'm doing.
---
As long as they are making money it will continue
---
You're welcome for my service
---
Imho, I would lose rank 2 and 3 from the other 2 as well. But That's just personal preference. You may wish to invest some more in agility if you're a sniper for the increased sneak multiplier.
---
Awesome I'm in, I love taking photos around Appalachia!
---
Handguns with silencers are just as overpowered as rifles, only major difference being that you can't run max rank adrenaline.  But without a silencer, they're weak.  Just like laser rifles.
---
There was no announcement, AFAIK. (There basically never seems to be for these types of changes.) But given it was known that MODUS no longer sold the masks at the time when Bethesda fixed the item names for all the Scout armor pieces which *are* being sold by MODUS, I figure that if that change was not intentional, they are at least OK with the current state, at least for the time being.
---
So yeah, looks like we'll just have to live with that ridiculously low 0.01% drop chance from Divide events for now. :-(
---
Personally I've found them being sold at the Manufacturing Wing's shop. Maybe someone sold theirs and I was seeing it, but I've seen it many times there.
---
I'd like to think its just a bug they use to be easily obtainable...
---
Very nice. I can confirm, no picture though, that I definitely got the shielded raider plan from uranium fever. Also all of the jumpsuits in one drop.
---
You do realize wastelanders was only delayed no cancelled right?
---
Okay thank you. Gonna spend in agilty the next few. Changed lockpick with master rifleman to increase the damage. 
---
With lose the rank 2 and 3 you mean lockpick? Or what perk?
---
“For now”. 
---
The game has been out for a year and despite the lack of actual useable end game weapon types there has been almost 0 weapon balancing. 
---
Would love to try our some new weapons, but most are just so bad even with elite rolls.
---
Does anyone know the user of the guy who bought the website? I would like to contact him so I can report on this for my journalism course project. :)
---
this is a joke post, isn’t it?
---
Wastelanders is going to be the first real major content update by BGS Austin, I would wait for its release to decide what to think about the future of the game. As far as I know, much of the Wild Appalachia content and Vault 94 have been in the files since the B.E.T.A. in a half finished state, while the battle royale mode was made by the Dallas studio. So, either Austin was working mainly on Wastelanders most of the time this year, and the other updates since the summer were lacking because the focus was not on them, or there was never much effort put into post launch support. Hopefully the former, but we will see. Regarding the subscription, I am not sure if the parent company would have been willing to fund the development of any major content after the game did not sell well, and probably atoms did not, either.
---
Yeah, that's where they used to always be... but I haven't seen any there in ages.
---
I just want Harper's Ferry as the center of a map.
---
Before the Halloween event, people were already very angry at them. Yet they produced one of the most buggy and broken events. To me, this proves the game **will never improve upon its current state**. I still play the game and enjoy it but I have abandoned all  hope for it getting better. The current bugs will stay, any free content will be broken crap (maybe not wastelanders since they postponed it) and only Atom shop and subscription stuff will get any attention.   
---
I think it is strange people are still posting 'Bethasda please..' or 'can we have...'. Nobody is listening... Unless maybe you mention you'd like to pay atoms for having the thing you are requesting.
---
lol what about the Halloween event? Seems like you're fear mongering my guy. We'll probably be getting another road map with Wastelanders
---
Always handy when they proc after you die
---
I mean, there are a LOT of them out there, they were the coolest looking gas mask in the game, so it makes sense that they'd put a fix at the bottom of an extremely long list, I suppose. Still, kinda sucks, but oh well. Least I still got my urban.
---
I'm not sure but that could be in the mire map that's coming at some point though I guarantee it's gonna be so hard to see people on that map. Night time versions of Morgantown and Flatwoods would also be pretty cool ngl
---
I was referring to rifleman perks. The first stat is a must but the 2nd and 3rd only cumulativly add as much as the first. 
---
You may want to be careful with weight reduction perks as well. As you level and get legendary gear, you will find yourself getting to 90% reduction. This is a hard cap and you cant get it any higher. All weights can only be reduced to 10% of their base weight. Not matter how much above 90% you stack.
---
Also, if I remember correctly some of your intelligence perks arent needed all the time. Like armorer. You get no benefit from having it on, you do get benefit from having white knight on though.
---
In general, nothing works right on “laggy servers.”
---
Same. I've just been kinda waiting to see if they came back, but finally decided to ask in case I missed an announcement.
---
Halloween event?
---
Ah, you mean the blue screen simulator!
---
It's the ESO method of game development, honestly works well enough
---
Well quite a few mfactors comparing how much code pre internet era games had vs now, but for the most part games were complete and playable, with no way to easily patch a product post launch it would essentially be a defective product where as now devs can try to stomp game breaking bugs while still letting annoying ones linger yet launch the product to make their publishers happy.
---
Sorry your internet sucks
---
You are welcome bro 😎👉👉
---
I'm with you lol Who knows if they did it on purpose or not but yeah ..prob a bug.
---
I'm in already. Love the great photos incoming all day!
---
Absolutely, it’s almoat bearing the point that it should have been at release. (Minus a bullshit subscription service)
---
Every time I'm in Harper's Ferry, I think "Damn this would be an epic tdm map.  Or amazing as an event where it's the free states vs raiders.
---
Maybe not, but they had to do what we desire as we are the reason why they exist in first place. Next game that they will lunch will be total failure. If they not smart enough to see this coming they will  cease to exist. But for now I call for every one who still care about this franchise try to wake up those developers behind desktops to start acting
---
Common bug - usually have that problem with pioneer scout Toxic Valley daily where toxic goo doesn't show on map or with Queen of the Hunt daily from Mire where I can't see the location to check for cryptids. Only solution for me was server change.
---
Can guarantee this is already in the works. 
---
Can also guarantee hear items will be exclusive to fallout 1st suckers or overpriced in atom shop to drive micro transactions.
---
Sad thing is that free states vs raiders would be good on a private server so there isn't interference but alas I'm not buying into fallout first till the perks are worth the money
---
I don't think they had baby Sheepsquatch on their list
---
Why does the game look so bad? Low settings?
---
&gt;I have the feeling that Fallout 1st is their attempt at milking the remaining playerbase before shutting everything down. 
---
If it's making money why shut down?
---
You disproved your own theory
---
Voted. I hope that bethesda Pr shills choke and dont ruin that poll.
---
And private servers only allow 8 people.  4v4 is pretty crap for a place as big as Harper's Ferry.  I dont have any reason to get 1st either because half my friends list has their own that I can just join.
---
True
---
Bomber jacket wasn't rare before they put the PA skins in. I still have a couple dozen. Might of been my vendor if your on xbox I put a couple in for 100 caps once in awhile
---
They didn't take the servers down for fixing when the duping exploded and people were duping god rolls and you want them to ban someone for a few kills ?
---
They only weigh like 1lb and there's no perks which reduce their weight, so there's no difference between having them on your person or in your stash. As such, there's no reason not to just have several of them on you at any given time. My character always has like eight of them.
---
Oh, I didn't know that half this sub had bad Internet, since everyone except the most extreme shills are reporting the same issues.
---
Are you a shill?
---
You can still find folks selling them for caps if you look at the Market sub. The Forest variant is generally more than the Urban one, but they are around.
---
The -2 perception can be a minor annoyance if you run a tightly bound build for ranged weapons, but they look cool, so...
---
If you weren't overencumbered then it's even more ridiculous that you didn't have at least one spare on you. If you were butting right up against your weight limit I could see - maybe - storing a few in your stash box, but as it stands, it makes no sense for you to have left them there when you were doing literally the only thing in the game where you'd ever need them.
---
Even Beth can't be that stupid. First sell people something and then take it away. This would be very stupid thing to do businesswise. All those angry people who were fooled.
---
And Starfield and ES6 is made by completely different teams.
---
Oh, you are a troll. Nevermind.
---
If you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's fine, my man.
---
Sorry mate, i can't upvote suggestions anymore because bethesda will sell them back to us later.
---
They know that the whales will eat their shit no matter how many times they fuck up.
---
Not a troll, just see Bethesdas lying as damaging to their company and that we shouldn't take everything they say at face value.
---
It's pretty obvious that I'm not a shill if you go over my post history pre-F1st. But going over yours it seems like you're on an alt account.
---
Are you an astroturfing alt account?
---
Yes, bugs exist, yes crashes exist. However, it's less than it was nearly a year ago and on top of that 76 had its moments, like fascnaut and Meatweek. 
---
As hopeless as it seems, fallout 76 is making progress,  just slowly. 🐢
---
They didn't sell us player vending, backpacks or vault raids, which were confirmed player suggestions
---
Kinda weird way to milk it, by hiring 20+ new people to the studio that only works on this right before dropping it. Nah. I don't think so.
---
They're procking while you're alive it's just the animation is delayed. Same with super duper. You can craft an item 100 times and might only hear and see the super duper emote thingy once or twice.
---
Wastelanders will  change everything
---
Sauce?
---
This, depending on your bargaining power the 3 plans (chest, arms, legs) go for 90-120 caps each.
---
I'll buy these every time I pass through Grafton and then vending machine them for 150 caps each and they sell pretty regularly.
---
You've contracted diabetes!
---
We leave the silo all the time. Two of us will prep a couple of silos, one will launch, we kill the queen, the other person goes back to the silo and launched the second.  After about 20 minutes you may have to rescan and redo launch prep bit all of the doors are open, and the bots should have not respawned. In the room where you repair the mainframe cores there is a door that is a short cut that you should open for direct entry if you die or leave the silo.  There is no way that the silo is going to reset in the time it takes to go-to your camp to grab a card and go back. But there is no stash box in the silos.
---
Close the game out 10 minutes before the event starts.
---
Plasma flamer pistol sounds pretty wizard-ly to me. Sheepsquatch staff works too.
---
“it’s just cosmetic”.
---
It's *slightly less* than it was a year ago. That doesn't say much about their "hard work". 
---
They are not ready to handle multiplayer games. I think we have enough evidence of that.
---
*checks post history*
---
Bruh, why did you just prove my point for me?
---
Thanks for all the help you did for this community, we will miss you but hopefully Bethesda sees this and unbans your account.
---
Same here, I'm perfectly happy to provide water, scrapbot scrap and all workbenches to anyone willing to travel to my CAMP
---
Why did you avoid mine?
---
Do you have any links proving any of this about this game? Because at this point, multiple dataminers have found it uses seeds based on characters/account with aten_ra post of testing the equivalent of 30k scrip over 25 characters. So literally every test performed and when further looking into the code dataminers have indeed found code calling for seeds.
---
So outside of your assumptions do you actually have any evidence to refute their claims?
---
What's yours? I've seen nothing but unfounded accusations.
---
Regarding your second update. I am upset about Fallout 1st and  did not/will not subscribe to it.  
---
I stopped playing the game, because of it!
---
lol k
---
No because Bethesda is no better? Yeah I did waste my money on the game I don't see why everyone is supporting a game like this one but whatever.
---
Game only says that when you modify the files so quit your lying you cheater.
---
Yeah. Most balances were stupid nerfs like dropping the drum magazine for the handmade to 30 rounds while keeping the armour piercing banana mag at 35, MONTHS AGO.
---
Thanks for the list.
---
Yeah, but I can't bring myself to pay those kind of prices for something that was once cheap in the Enclave, and is mostly just me being a kind of hoarder-of-all-things-Enclave, lol. Got my urban one for now, I'm good I guess, figure they'll get added back to vendors eventually.
---
Nah, it was a pretty diverse hire with content creators, graphic designers, programmers and others. Looks promising.
---
I thought that was the debuff from the storm in NW.
---
If so, it must just be a bug. I would leave when you get a second and log back in.
---
Errm yes it's err mine buddy. I've sort of changed my name put on 200 levels since we spoke last time oh and for some reason I've ended up on PS4..so just shout me ok
---
Hey OP, could you do another update with when we'll probably get results?
---
Well, you didn't need to confirmed my suspicion that you are a troll, but I thank you for it.
---
Don't listen. 
---
You can do mellee and autorifles very easily. 
---
Weight reduction perks are nice but they arn't even close to required. I havn't used any in over 100 levels. 
---
I have a Respomders character very similar to yours. It works very well for pretty much everything but pvp.
---
I dont see how my viewpoint of Bethesda and the state of the game being different to yours makes me a troll?
---
there's no stash once you enter raids.  if you can't manage to carry extra keycards id hate to see what happens when you are given 8+lbs of bulk scrap each run.
---
always plan ahead, always bring extra cards, never run to close to card expire time.
---
I would drop a point off of all the sluggers and grab with barbarian or blocker 
---
You don't have much in the way of defensive perks
---
NP.  
---
IDK if you have found the limits yet - you can carry up to about 1720 in excavator before you start crawling.  Other armor cuts off at about 1421.
---
I ran exclusively in excavator from L45 to about L138.  Changed over to X01/excavator pending weight.  
---
I finally tested some of the weight reduction armor I've picked up - I weight less out of PA than in it.  Down to about 1000 right now.   Downside is although torso armor DR is higher than most PA torsos, the DR on arms/leg armor is a lot less.
---
Having the game on a m.2 drive helped me alot with crashing ... i havnt crashed that often but i was always fast enough back in the game to finish the event.
---
Sleeping ghouls are the most annoying, the bullets I fire simply won’t register. Even grenades don’t do much.
---
You missed Patrol Duty from Toxic Valley. It has a guaranteed weapon plan drop for "low-tier" weapons, but it\`s a pain to farm since it takes forever. I\`ve gotten plans for at least the 10mm smg, submachine gun, single action revolver, short pump action shotgun, laser gun, plasma gun and m79 grenade launcher. My guess is the double barreled shotgun plan also drops here, but I haven\`t gotten lucky in approx. 50 something tries. It\`s super tedious farming this event, but I hope this info helps a bit.
---
That's awesome. Nice collection!! :D 
---
Tell your wife she is a plasma grenade plan of a woman. Ultra, ultra rare.
---
But that's exactly what it is. They're probably already focusing on the next venture ie. Starfield, and aren't putting any further resources into 76 besides the bare minimum skeleton crew that is likely working on Wastelanders. They've moved on, but are squeezing every last cent out of 76's playerbase before they do so.
---
Just to be clear, you are not talking about the quest markers (yellow), which indeed can and all too often do go missing, especially on poorly running/lagging servers, but missing fast-travel place markers (blue)?
---
I've never seen the latter. The closest I've come to this was on an especially poorly running server, when I had my map open very shortly after loading into the game. I had no place markers at first but watched them trickle in and populate the map one by one within few seconds.
---
Extrapolating from this, I'd have to guess at an incredibly poorly running server or a really bad internet connection. Alternatively, since you're on PC, are you running any unofficial map UI mods? If so, try disabling and/or updating them.
---
Let's hope they work better than the guys already in place lmao
---
Well I think they could make at least 2 o3 3 Wastelanders sized updates yet.... One for returning in the BOS, one for Freestates or other faction and another for Enclave...
---
You'll be sadly surprised when Elder Scrolls 6 becomes the highest selling game of all time.
---
That would be nice to be able to show them off.
---
Toxic valley
---
Just wait for the Steam sales.
---
Probably a generic burning effect that failed to go away.
---
They guys already in place were a studio bought up, given an engine they had never worked with before, told to use that single player engine to make a multiplayer game in a franchise they had never worked in before and were then given several deadlines they had no chance to meet. To be honest I think they are doing a fuckin' miracle considering all that. Sure, this game could have been better if the project had been given to the Fallout 4 studio. But I do not for a second think the Devs are bad or have done a bad job, considering what they got to work with.
---
Still deluded by those notions?
---
Can you send me your build?
---
I've run the event about 10 times and haven't crashed yet on PC. Some lag when laser gatlings and 20 different things are exploding but that's been it so far. What platform are you on?
---
Yea bugs galore with this game. Kinda of weird seeing a Bethesda game that doesn't have modders fixed it but just shines a light on the situation. Fun fact Lever Action Rifle from Far Harbor requires you reload all 5 bullets if you just use 1 and this was barely patched this year on Fallout 76 but Fallout 4 is no longer getting bug fixes.
---
Marriott WiFi is unforgiving... I am staying in a hotel for a few months for work. Sorry for the low quality!
---
Thats amazing
---
I think I would honestly enjoy this, despite having Never been any good at COD Zombies.
---
With the variety of enemies in the game it is very easily doable.
---
This is an amazing build, I'm not usually a fan of floating bases but this I like!
---
I do have a floating base though, a perfectly round flying saucer base above Senecca Rocks (highest point in game?).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/biwaju/help_this_spaceship_above_seneca_rocks_was_meant/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
They did need to need enough of Wastelanders finished for the E3 trailer
---
This is def not a hate post.  /s
---
There prob gonna put the stand behind F1 membership if they'd actually do it.
---
No, it’s not. Why would a secure government facility ***that you’re not even supposed to get into*** have a linked stash point that you can access?  Every other stash point is somewhere that you’re expected to be able to access. Even the Enclave bunker, because you are allied with them, has a reason to have a stash point. 
---
This is like complaining that in a D&amp;D type game that there’s no potion shop and rest point right before the final boss. 
---
Keycards weigh 1 pound. I carry at least five with me at all times. You’re the victim of ***poor planning*** **on your end**, not ‘bad game design’. 
---
Did you make sure that your weapons and armor were fully repaired before the silo run?  Did you take enough healing items with you?  Enough ammo?
---
You made a tactical error. Learn from it instead of trying to blame someone/something else.
---
You might want to check the games they have butchered before working on 76.
---
Do you have anything to discuss, or just casually shilling?
---
That's one guy. That must mean the rest are lying.
---
All depends on your skill set. I use an Explosive Western Revolver and pretty much merk anything in my path.
---
Thanks for advice, I have to say I'm pretty high level (160) and with Bersecker Explos. Gatling laser she went down quickly, but the huge amounts of demage I get was bit crazy for me (btw even lvl 91 deathclaw can't hurt me that bad) Maybe I have weak endurance, because I have most points in strenght and perception?
---
Having a crappy connection isnt exactly cheating which is probably what they are experiencing but I s'pose you could throttle back your internet manually  if you were really dead set on having a bad connection to exploit.  People used to do that in GTAO to get a lobby to themselves for a few hours.  Would think the npc mobs in NW would eat you alive though.  Meh, never understood the point of cheating anyway.  🤷‍♂️
---
Xbox. 2k?
---
Wasn't aware of that. Kinda cool, but... Who's gonna just eat sugar raw?
---
Yeah didn’t know it adds 80max dmg resistance
---
Any game lag is a separate issue from game design. Don’t move the goalposts.
---
They’ve already come back once, IIRC. So they’ll probably come back again.
---
I think you created a username just to be a troll.
---
Doom wasn't that bad, and the only other game they worked on before that was cancelled by Bethesda when they made them into Bethesda Austin and gave them them the Fallout 76 project. So more like game, not games. And not sure how Doom was butchered, I rather liked it.
---
Because introducing a year-long membership program and then shortly abandoning support for the game would open them up to potential legal liabilities.
---
Anything to discuss about the topic at hand? Or are you just going to throw ad hominems around?
---
I accumulated 5 pirate outfits and 3 WS jumpsuits during the mischief event.  A few jack o lantern suits as well.  I did the event about 50 times. 
---
I initially sold those outfits for 1K each then raised the price to 2K each.  I have a pirate outfit now I would sell for 2K and I’m on PS4.  Message me if interested. 
---
By the way, I don’t collect outfits so it’s a great revenue source for me.  Those damn outfits sell better than some of my legendary weapons (go figure).  
---
As for people pricing them for 20K or even 10K I’m sure you are the same people pricing your standard ammo at 3 caps per bullet.  I’ll keep walking and I buy a lot of ammo.
---
For the investors, yeah. It just works.
---
That's why they will keep minimal support to avoid that for a year, and then shut everything down.
---
Very good tips. I’m usually a completionist in games, but I just couldn’t continue the grind to the skeleton costume. As a PC player, this has really gotten out of hand. I’ve played NW since its beginning and I hope to see better things out of it.
---
Real hordes in horde events! Not just a steady trickle..
---
You can use Rad-X to disable Adrenal Reaction while testing
---
&gt; They are probably going to release wastelanders
---
I don't want to cry "wishful thinking", but the pessimist in me always takes over when I see posts on this sub.
---
"intelligent"  
---
"debate"  
---
Must be very frustrating for you to always be a victim
---
By the way I would trade someone straight up (pirate outfit) for a 3 star BOS sentinel chest armor piece.   Look me up.
---
I picked up a WS jumpsuit for 15 caps over the weekend.   Amazing
---
Everything comes back at least once usually with a discount. Also, most things go on sale eventually, so it pays off to wait for something you are interested in.
---
Just switching it to fanning the hammer would make the Single Action a reasonable contender (against similar pistols). Hell, make that an 'attachment', and make it use the commando perks. Maybe speed up the reload a touch too.
---
It was really satisfying to use around level 15-20, when I got my first one.
---
I think the biggest problem with pistols overall is that they lack in both power and magazine size. Every pistol needs one or the other boosted.
---
I was a 1H melee/sniper until about L60.  Like you, I don't use chems, dont PvP, and run solo most of the time.
---
Changed to 1H melee/heavy after that because I was starting to regularly deal with flying things - it's kinda tough to take out a strategic cargo bot with a sniper rifle, and while a combat rifle will take down a L50 SB, it barely tickles a L65.
---
They need to give up on this shit, antiquated engine.  They could have used this whole game as a learning experience.  It should have been kept free (especially since the assets were just copied straight from FO4 anyway) while tracking player activities and forums to see what's popular, what's not, what works, and what doesn't.  Why not use that information to build a new and *functional* subscription service game, if that's the way they want to go?  Instead they are so desperate to wring every last penny out of this shit show that they are just losing customers.
---
A new Elder Scrolls would have been an automatic pre-order for me and now I don't even care that one is in the works.  I refuse to throw money at companies with that use these practices.
---
I'm not here to supply lube so you can spank your hateboner.
---
Maybe throw in the remainder of the maps as well. How long is BETA supposed to be?
---
The M King is totally crazy on dmg output.  I got jacked the other day by one.  Two hits and I was down.
---
For the players who enjoy the game too. Not everyone wants games to be taken down and removed from their sight. If people don't like a game they just... Stop playing and paying attention
---
I'd love a Pirate Outfit, it's the only one I didn't get. Also, I'm available in 4 hours, dunno if that's too late for you
---
I got the costume on one character and the hat on the other 🤷‍♂️.
---
Top priority patch 15 suggestion: FIX JETPACKS
---
Agreed, I’ll honestly say I was better with the first map lol.
---
Actually a pretty good idea. Reddit does seem to have a higher percentage of people who blindly hate the game whereas the forums are more highly moderated and have a higher percentage of blind shills. It'd definitely be interesting to see the difference.
---
bethesa = jews
---
I have about 7 of them in my stash now after running the event all week. I'm guessing their value has massively dropped from a few weeks ago. .
---
With my luck, they’re always held when I’m out of town and unable to play. I’m going away again next weekend, so that’s my guess.
---
I didn't realize that perk has its own animation. Pretty cool!
---
For the record, you could just use Google Forms rather than these sketchy ass sites. Unless you got something against using google, no reason not to go with how reliable and customizable it is.
---
I’ve been dying for this fix. I’m in more agony than Anakin Skywalker in Lake Country on Naboo.
---
With toxic goo Gravy, diseased cranberry jelly, and perfectly preserved pie!
---
Does Party Boy work with Biv's alcohol as well? That would be sick
---
They didn't delay Wastelanders for no reason. They want it to be good for people who have criticized the game.
---
Fallout 1st was actually originally planned to be released with Wastelanders, but I think releasing it earlier was a better idea so that even though it created waves of controversy, the waters will eventually at least come back to how they were before by the time Wastelands gets released.
---
Here we go again
---
I leave my stuff open.  Water purifiers, collection, workbenches, whatever.  Help yourself
---
There is a direct correlation to people locking in their stuff and people overpricing their shit.  I’d say 90% of the time those that lock up their stuff are the same people charging 2000 caps for a 1 star legendary or 2 or 3 caps each for regular ammo.  Won’t git my bidness I’ll keep walking.
---
Oh I enjoyed the game until I realize it was a cashgrab for whales.
---
That’s the spirit 😉👍
---
Don’t forget the Brahmin whipped cream.
---
great ideas!  may i also suggest banners and bayonets?  battle over control points in fort picket with muskets (and apply 'pain train' perk to those weapons!)
---
Great job! I happen to like Uranium Fever and the Scorchbeast Queen events the best as they always have multiple people show up for them and I love the team aspect of fighting together on the server against a common enemy. The Halloween mischief night event is also a ton of fun. 
---
Too many of the other events are just empty, and I don’t want to complete them solo. I have done Tea Time too many times by myself...boring
---
you’re truly awesome man. thank you so much. my used is CulLavellan (we share an account)
---
Gotta do it in private servers man
---
he’s got the suit but I think he wants to keep it
---
Yes, I need alcohol when playing this game. My drunken decreased reaction speed makes the game look more fluent.
---
I’ve got someone that said 5,000 was good enough
---
The damage cap was not great.  In fact, that change alone probably killed survival mode.  That may have been the intent all along.
---
The game takes place in what was the US so it would make sense to have at least something for the holiday.  It's kind of a big deal here lol  Was wondering myself if they would turn fasnatch or meatweek back on for the long weekend or something.  Least they could do is give us a purveyor discount weekend or double xp, preferably both 😎
---
I love the comments on it
---
&gt; What the shit is this fuck?
---
&gt; Who are you people?
---
Or just takes up a load of camp budget.
---
someone commented that they’re willing to give it to him for 5,000 caps
---
Dismissed, thank you.
---
Probably meat week and double XP or something.
---
If it makes my character grow a Wilford Brimley walrus mustache... I might be okay with the diabeetus.
---
Management that is not mentally challenged.
---
What rant?  
---
I'm not the OP, was tagged on the post because I do the bug roundups, and besides people have the right to vent, especially after spending money...
---
And I don't know about you, but I'm taking a pass on inviting Grahm this year. He hogs the turkey legs, drinks too much Red Ant Ale and argues loudly with the other guests.
---
And I'm not inviting Grahm this year. He just gets too drunk and up close and personal with my niece.
---
Each individual pellet seems to lifesteal similar to your Medic's healing. I've got a Vampiric Explosive Double Barrel, and I've spent the week right up in the legendary sentry's face. It, plus two or three assaultrons, still don't deal enough DPS to take me down.
---
   
---
bethesda: ok but you will have to pay 800 atoms
---
Yeah I just bought one. It’s nuts, it’s like a crit heal from medics literally every time you shoot.
---
Anybody can die in a hail of bullets if the air is thick enough with gunfire.
---
You didn't check out ESO beforehand?
---
These are the kind of shit posts that bethesda is talking about ! People actually want to PAY for items that come for free ! There you go, this is how F1st came to life.
---
Having to repeat the same quest well over a thousand times to get an item that will be rendered obsolete after a few levels is absolute horseshit. I grind enough in my daily life, games are an escape from that. If I have to do X in a game more than ten times to get something I'm going to reach for the devconsole, and if thats not practical, ask myself what brain damage it took for me to start playing another MMO after the same grindy boring bullshit drove me out of WoW, EVE, and FF14.
---
That’s not really cheating
---
And boy is that Ivory Grip plan rare
---
/s
---
Bought two: 100 caps and 500 caps.
---
my boyfriend’s got a pistol build and I’m sure he could say the same about that. it’s the best pistol (excluding BP) in the game.
---
Well I just got my hands on an AAE 50 dr laser rifle so maybe that will do the trick.
---
It only needs to hit heavier. Like a real punch.
---
Statistics are not part of a regular math course thru middle and high school.
---
You would have to pay 10k to 15k in caps anyway, might as well make it easier on myself by using real money.
---
I read a lot of complaints about crashing and poor drops.  personally, never experienced that.
---
PS4, I averaged about 4 runs per day.  Weekdays, I quit back to the main menu between events, did IRL stuff.  Over the weekend, I stayed logged on/playing, but or server hopped after the event if I had aggro'd the bots
---
Crashes = 0
---
failed events = 0
---
nuked events = 0
---
experienced lag = about 1/3 of the events
---
number of times I tagged the boss, but didn't get loot = 4
---
Event rewards: of the datamined list put on here, got (at least) one of everything except the mobster pumpkin and the short suit.
---
I can't complain.
---
Well it’s hard to get anybody in the quest when you have no friends in your private server
---
Wow, really? Of all I wrote that is all you got out of that? I wasn’t saying you were ranting, I was talking about the community at large. The sad part is that the majority of these people are full grown adults. That means that the prefrontal cortex is fully developed. For people under the age of 25 it is somewhat different seeing as how without that development the amygdala has the biological advantage to hijack the prefrontal cortex and contribute to anti-social or at least immature social interaction.
---
I’ve run the event a lot and could not get  the costume nor the hat to drop. I finally  got the Whitesprings jumpsuit on the last run I did. Guess I’m doomed to be a landlubber lol.
---
School I went to didnt have statistics as a mandatory class. It was an elective taken only by people interested in it.
---
There's no turkeys that I can see, maybe a roasted molerat?  Or maybe we can get a giant, mutated turkey fight
---
That's how fallout1st started. People willing to pay money so they can have more stash. That's what we got. If you are willing to pay why not buy private server and do it there then ?
---
 Hi

---
For an “optimized” Sniper build you would need to make some substantial changes. The game mechanics favour specialization and melee/ranged use different SPECIAL characteristics (STR main for Melee while PER/AGI are main for snipers).
---
I will put a suggested link for a sniper build (link to Nukes&amp;Dragons – as I am more familiar with it).
---
Please note… there’s a balance between “quality of life” perks and “max damage” perks. Your character may maximized for one-two-shotting mobs – but a difficult to manage (inventory for example). So, please take my comments only as suggestions.
---
A few preliminary comments:
---
\- Stealth would be a must for Sniper. It provides excellent damage multipliers and keeps you alive. Some points would need to be moved to AGI. 
---
\- LUCK is also very important (critical hit chance, perks, etc)
---
\- For a sniper build – main characteristics would be AGI, PER and LCK – everything else is secondary.
---
\- Mutations – you should get some basic mutations and “Starched Genes” (to prevent losing mutations) and “Class Freak” (to reduce their negative effects by 75%)
---
\- Many perks are needed only in certain situations. For example: your crafting perks are needed only while you are in your base; weight management perks only when you become over-encumbered (unless you are always over-encumbered) 
---
PER: The main perks for a sniper would be the 3 Rifleman perks – ideally at lvl.3 each; Tank Killer (for armor penetration) and Concentrated Fire (for those headshots, crippling legs and extra damage). Other perks may be substituted situationally when necessary (Pick Lock, Green Thum as needed or Glow Sight for nuke zones).
---
AGI: For Sniper - start with Stealth skills. “Covert Operative” lvl.3 for those sneak ranged attacks. “Escape Artist” allows you to go back into hiding by standing up and crouching again. “Dodgy” for survivability – lvl.3. Action Boy/Girl for the extra VATS points (goes well with Concentrated Fire perk).   “Gun-Fu” for chaining kills.  Adrenaline lvl.1 for the extra damage (more levels provide diminishing returns). “Sandman” is great at night (you can consider using it instead). “Born Survivor” lvl.1 greatly improves survivability (or lvl.2 if you have autostim armour).  Note: “Born Survivor” should not be used if you will be using a bloodied build.
---
LUCK: Mutations are very powerful and useful - I would start with “Starched Genes” lvl.2 and “Class Freak” lvl.3.  “Bloody Mess” lvl.3 for that extra 15% damage (and the gross visual effects). For the remaining points my preference is “Better Criticals”. “Super Duper” can be substituted when crafting.
---
STR: For a “Sniper” build – Strength is the sacrificed characteristic. I would recommend it at 3 to have the Blocker perk. When needed, it can be substituted for Pack Rat or Walking Pharmacy (depending on what’s weighing you down most)
---
END: This is the other sacrificed characteristic for a sniper. You should keep it as low as comfortable. I would recommend 1-3 points. Rejuvinated is a frequently overlooked perk – it provides extra HP and Action Points as long as you are well fed. Other good perks to consider as substitutes: Aqua Boy/Girl, FireProof lvl 1-2 (for Scorch Beasts and Super Mutants’ grenades or if you have an explosive weapon). Radicool is very useful if you are running a “bloodied build”.
---
CHA: There are several useful skills in CHA. I would recommend it at 6. Lone Wanderer lvl.3 (20% less damage and 30% AP regen is very powerful), Tenderizer (for that extra 5% damage), Travel Agent as quality of life (can be replaced with Suppressor). Hard Bargain as a substitute when needed. Also, having CHA of 6 allows to share 2 perk levels if you are playing in a team (so won’t be a total egoist).
---
INT: If you mainly play solo, you need it at 5 so as not to rely on anyone for crafting and modding weapons. If using a “bloody” build – Nerd Rage is a must. Otherwise Gunsmith and/or First Aid. Other perks are important to have and can be substituted when needed (Hacker, crafting perks, etc.). “Weapon Artisan” and “Fix-It-Good” are important perks to have as substitutes as they allow you to repair your weapons/armour to 200%. “Scrapper” is also great perk as it allows you to get extra materials from scrapping. 
---
Mutations: Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, Adrenal Reactions, Marsupial, Speed Demon, Scaly Skin, Healing Factor.  If you are not using energy weapons, then Grounded mutations as well.
---
Other Notes: 
---
\- I would recommend 1 Chameleon armour piece and 1 Autostim armour piece.
---
\- Take a look at “Bloody” builds or “Junkie’s” builds. Both are very powerful for a sniper (and are considered “Meta” at the moment). Junkie’s is a more forgiving build as it allows you to play with full HP while still providing up to +50% damage
---
Nope. Its an elective at most US high schools and isnt really covered in algebra, which is whats mandated. Not only that but most people forget most of what they went over in HS within a few years anyway.
---
I heard the combat was stale, waiting for Black Friday to check it out. Wouldn't want to make the same mistake some people made with F76. "i PaId SiXtY dOlLaRs FoR tHiS gAmE"
---
It reset?  A couple nights ago, I had just cleared the launch sequence (hadn't yet put in my keycard) when someone else from another silo launched a nuke at the SBQ.  I was able to fast travel to my camp, then to the SBQ, and come back to my silo to launch my nuke at the SBQ right away.
---
That first SBQ was down in only a few minutes though, so maybe there's a timer?
---
Turkeysquatch?
---
Been there, done that, quit in large part because of it.
---
Sure, I can sell it for 2k. Apostate Nate is my XBox gamertag, and I'll be on later today.
---
Never played ESO.
---
They fix JetPacks in next patch but now the power armor glitch is back.
---
sick I’ll add you (we share an account)
---
From mole rats and ghouls to deathclaws and scorchbeasts
---
you are a mad lad as well  as a complete and total hero!
---
Yeah youtubers have been pitting FO76 and The outer worlds against each other before either game was released. It’s sensationalist faux competition click bait that has stuck because people are hella tribal.
---
The guns I felt were limited and the comat while ok wasnt amazing. I was also pretty annoyed with their decision to go with Epic as well, but that is a discussion for another time/place. Black Friday is a wise idea IMO.
---
about ten minutes. Event shuts down in about 3 hours 15 minutes...
---
What only 800? Bethesda must be getting soft then as I would of assumed it was 1,500 atoms.
---
Side Note Bethesda this a joke do not make this 1,500 atomsA!
---
If you want the flexibility of melee and ranged...
---
Heavy Weapons and Shotguns are based on STRength - just like melee.  Harpoon Guns are decent sniper-like weapons.
---
PS.  If you are on PC - I can help with the build.
---
Have fun fellow Wastelander
---
You might be about to spontaneously combust
---
Ok I'll look there
---
I'm the guy who made Mappalachia if you saw that - and I've essentially done the same.
---
The terrible development quality, lack of support and greedy monetisation has pushed me away from the game. So much like the dude who made Map76, I am no longer able to support my project.
---
15 is max special no matter what, and you cant max all of them only a limited amount. I believe 50+ you can either pick a perk card, or relocate a perk point. Nuke launches can be done as soon as you get the quest assuming you have a decent build.
---
Thank you. Stunning work. Almost too much to take it all in. Hope you had fun in your endeavours.
---
Love this camp. Kinda of wish restrictions were loosen on the current rules we have now for camps especially since we have nothing to do till Feb-March.
---
It’s a good thing it’s not a necessity to buy the subscription then if that’s how you feel.
---
Personally, I would like to see brand new rewards myself.
---
Search for the responder vendor bot, grahm, the re-enactor and the trick or treater. They all have plans for "rare" outfit plenty of guides available online.
---
Yeah it breaks my heart when I have to delete photos. I still have a good number of junk ones I wouldn't miss off my photo collection while loading, but i'm gradually reaching the point where i'd have to pick and choose from the 'babies'
---
Great thanks for the help
---
It was in castlevania harmony of despair for sonic boots it was a 6 player castlevania and an amazing game and items in that game never were out lvled
---
Oh great one of the buildings on the map I hate the most. Lol
---
It does seem to be the case. I have seen a number of clickbait titles to this effect on YT. IIRC even the devs of OW were keen to not have the game compared with FO or to criticize Bethesda and for me the games are totally different. I am getting a much stronger Bioshock vibe from it (a good thing) with a hint of borderlands personally, but I dont feel much Fallout there. NV in space it aint.
---
WOW I really read every bit of this! thanks for the data crunch..
---
It's too late, they're raising the price as we speak!
---
Todd, is that you?!
---
And that's a good thing, unfortunate at the time, but still a good thing. There needs to always be something that can challenge the top tier predators.
---
Otherwise, they grow weak, and die of boredom. 
---
Pretty sure that's what happened to the T-rex (aside from the whole meteor thing).
---
🤥🤥
---
hi!!! Im so sorry i missed this message, Id be down to buy/trade for those, i tried again last night and only got meat hook plan and vault boy cut out.... no outfits!
---
psn id FritoZ
---
please add me tonight!  Im all about that pirate outfit, i might build a new camp that looks like a pirate ship!
---
Yep. As per their web page:

lol i've not gotten it either yet, i think there's a few recipes i don't have yet still :(
---
WHAT... you can use the punch bowls?! I thought they were just ornamental...🤦🏼‍♂️
---
I also haven't seen any bugs for a long time, bethesda is actively trying to fix the game
---
ok great! please add me,
---
I had no luck again last night getting any outfits :(
---
so im excited to get the opportunity to buy one from you!

---
I'm okay with jumping in vats, but power attack in vats is a no to me. As a melee build, I think it will make too much damage...
---
You want it included in a bundle for 2000? Say no more!
---
Lol, your point is obsolete as its based on nothing more than emotion and relying on very little facts if any.
---
I agree. Picked up the pirate suit for 25c at a vendor in the Forest on Sunday! Already had the cap from event.
---
and xbox
---
yeah about that, a little more closer to 300 on avaerage, and 1st place nets around 700 i think?
---
Don’t you mean snow them off
---
After level 50, every level up will prompt you to either pick a new perk card or move a skill point from one special to another.
---
After I hit level 50, I dialed down my points in INT in favor of more points in Luck, and was able to get the Starched Genes and Class Freak perks fully ranked up, which made acquiring and keeping mutations possible.
---
As stated before you can launch a nuke as soon as you get the quest. You may want to get some help the first time, though. Likewise with Arktos Pharma or the Encryptid event.
---
A fast way to get ammo is to simply craft what you need. Stock up on steel, lead, and gunpowder, equip the AGI Ammosmith perk, and the Luck Super Duper perk and craft away. Get your steel and gunpowder from super mutants (scrap their weapons with the INT Scrapper perk), and clean out Lucky Hole Mine in your Excavator power armor for lead ore.
---
A stand alone horde mode with removed variables such  as world space and scorchbeasts could prove for a stable and steady game. Like they could use assets for set locations like the brotherhood bases. But knowing Bethesda they’ll try to make it an event and juice it up with enemies and crash the game.
---
Did you find a fix?
---
That’s why I bought the game, I know the rng and grinding for legendary‘s is super boring for some people but I live for this stuff :)
---
Fair points there especially the dialogue one. I have played every FO game including the original Black Isle games when they released so I get where you are coming from. I always prefered FO3 myself as it was more geared towards exploration. NV is good but for me personally 3 was better in a number of ways. However that is a discussion for another time...
---
Great so basically turning fallout into even less of a fallout game
---
I love claiming the ammo factory, but do it mainly for the defend events.  I regularly get multiple star legendary enemies in the waves that attack the place and ballistic fiber is pretty consistently a reward for completing them.
---
Since I'm claiming it anyway, I'll go ahead and power up the processor to supplement the ammo I craft on my own.  I've also used it to craft ammo that I don't personally use but can sell in my vendors.  All of my crafting supplies go toward my personal use and then anything generated is sold for a profit.
---
Just a few bugs I encounter daily:
---
* Try to fast-travel from an area with no enemies, and it dumps you back to the game screen from the map instead of traveling. It may take 10+ attempts to successfully fast-travel.
---
* Try to pick an emote from the emote wheel and it changes to the weapon wheel
---
* Load into a world and my equipped weapon (and only the equipped weapon) has 0 ammunition in the clip. May have to reload 2-3 times to be able to  fire. Also randomly happens when changing between weapons
---
* Snipe an enemy from a long distance and by the time you get there to loot the body, the body has either vanished, reanimated into a "live" position but is actually dead, and has no loot like someone else killed it
---
 Cite them. Burden of proof is on the claimant.
---
Yup. I would love an actual discussion about this. And even with the tone in the OP, I had some hopes about this. 
---
But that’s not what he wants.
---
You think, Todd?
---
I haven’t played since July, so I updated the game and tried to play today. Tried. Froze 2x and I guess nothing has changed. lol what a disappointment. Shame on anyone who puts dollars into this mess ☹️
---
And the shitshow continues. Counting the days until this greedy dumpsterfire gets shut down next year....
---
I really hope Bethesda made huuuge money on this, because they will loose so much of Starfield, ESO6 and the next Fallout sale because of Fallout 76... I hope people don't forget.
---
I'd say 60-70% - hopefully I am wrong!
---
YASS!! I loved the snow globes soo much and I would love to have them back!!
---
I'm surprised you havnt been downvoted into oblivion yet. 
---
Guess it's only been an hour 
---
Ha!
---
I didn't get anything either and I did it just as much as you. People will just say "you're unlucky" when it reality bethesda needs to fix their bugs. There's no reason why someone should have 10 pirate costumes, 7 fireman uniforms, 5 Jack O Lantern outfits and get one everytime they run it. If they're that fucking lucky with RNG, they need to be playing the lottery.
---
Every time you post this, you continue to prove my point.
---
Ammo: if you have enough acid to smelt it (good sources are bloodbug proboscises, Yao Gui, snallygasters, and the Hemlock Holes workshop), then just take a cruise through Lucky Hole Mine wearing excavator armor. There are a bunch of lead veins in there to mine and you can come out with enough lead to smelt into well north of 600 lead. For steel, supermutants and scorched usually have steel-based weapons. The Scrapper perk will help get more stuff. To make ammo, the 2* Ammosmith perk gives you more rounds, and the superduper perk gives you a chance to make 2 of anything any time you craft something.
---
Attaboy 👊😎
---
Good point. I forgot about the assholes.
---
Let beth know so we can get that 2x xp! thanks in advance!
---
Tim Cain worked on it, who was also one of the original devs of the first Fallout.
---
Brother preach
---
Oh, I know it'll take a full team of people to fix it
---
Only if we get free ammo during it.
---
I never got the Pirate Hat or the Pumpkin Pant Suit/Shorts either.  I managed to buy a pant suit at a player vendor, though.
---
It's strange because on my main, I got few duplicate rewards.  Plans were handed out almost like they are in the nuclear plant events, as if the game checked to see what I had and gave me what I didn't.  But on my alt, she got a flurry of duplicates.  More of those Mobster Pumpkins than I could count.
---
The event rewards probably would have been more reasonable if those silly vases were removed from the rotation.  I don't get those at all - they weight 10 WT apiece (excessive, much?) and are practically identical to the vases you can already place in your CAMP.  What was the point?
---
You don’t have the **power** to dismiss me, son. It’s a public post. 
---
Get a mod to remove me if I’ve violated any rules of Reddit or this sub. 
---
Otherwise, you opened this up for discussion. You can’t unring that bell. 
---
***You have no power here.***
---
Well dookie. I don't have any spares, I would donate one if I did. I apologize ):
---
All pure luck the last few events Faschnat, meat week I got next to nothing as well... this time I did extremely well.
---
This is Bethesda. They re-used assets, gameplay and probably run on a very small team in Austin. This is not poor Bethesda they need money to pay their employees. This is upper management greed who want a better bottom line to get more money when they make an IPO... 
---
Or Vaultec Upper Managment experimenting on the dwellers to see how much cash they can make. How much the can monetize before the break the game. So they can do it better with Starfield, ESO and the next Fallout...
---
Nope
---
Skull mask only. No hats
---
There goes my only strategy for surviving past the first round. :P
---
In the room where you fix the mainframe, there’s a door you can unlock that leads to the storeroom in the residential sector. Open it from the mainframe room side and I think you should be able to duck out to a train station and then get back to the silo room quickly. That said, I always bring at least 2 cards in case I screw up the code.
---
They already told us they don't give a shit wether you paid upfront for the game. So don't bet people how bought the game will have any benefits over free2play customers.
---
I've seen that much in people's inventory after the event and tried to buy the spares and no one would budge
---
Just giving a suggestion on what sounds like a good investment doesnt make someone a shill, people are allowed to give praise to things thst they think are good
---
I guess but you do it while you are in a bush so you are well hidden, and because you can zoom out you can tell if someone is near enough to spot you.
---
It's a gun that was never meant to be in the game, take it with a grain of salt. I have one and use it for PvP, or when shit hits the fan and I need to wipe a group in west tek or white springs. It's not a main weapon, its a get out of jail free card,
---
I’ve contacted support 5 times asking for a full refund of this game and only response I get it well you downloaded it soooo no refund
---
Same, that pirate costume became like crack *itch* *itch* 👀
---
&gt; An exploit was leaked about a month ago on an obscure forum. We discovered it, tested to make sure it was real, and reported it directly to the community managers.
---
Which is the wrong way to do it, but never mind.
---
farma Pharma thru the morgantown airport
---
Let me clarify. 
---
Keep trying with something that might actually work.
---
Hey, uhhh, do you remember I lent you my lämp bröther? I needs it back now.
---
May I ask what do silencers do in the game?
---
Player specific because it is considered an atom store item.
---
Unyielding armor wearers die and can either spawn at Vault 76 or nowhere at all, having to leave the server. Unyielding wearers also die and have the camera spin around their body that requires restart or wait 10+ minutes to respawn. These are game breaking.
---
Add one more to the tally. 
---
Keep it up.
---
Even more sad. To be sure (if thatone has to wait several months after release how bad the monetization is. How long the stick to their promises.
---
Sometimes when fast traveling to a location (maybe just player vendors?), it will send me to a random other player vendor. Extremely rare, only seen this happen twice in 600 hours, but once recently.
---
Jumping with a jetpack will sometimes, quite often actually, instantly activate the jetpack, when you're just trying to jump. Also, when laggy (maybe? I've noticed it happens a lot to me during the event), it'll send me in to space.
---
Ghouls sometimes have no animations, and will slide around and attack while appearing to be lying on the ground.
---
Some enemies will just be standing still, no animation or AI, able to take damage but not register it. Either the damage indicator shows that I'm doing damage, but they don't take any, or they take the damage but instantly regain all HP upon reaching zero. Not a big deal since they just stand there, not doing anything. Sometimes they're event just lootable corpses with no loot (not killed by me), but they're standing there.
---
Occasionally, ghouls will stand there, similarly to the NPCs described in the previous paragraph, but will run straight through walls after standing motionless for a while.
---
Fast travelling to a newly spawned event (such as the currently running halloween event) takes a few tries or some time before it actually lets me fast travel there.
---
Entering or exiting power armor will disable the Lock and Load (+30% reload speed for heavy weapons) until you swap weapons.
---
The currently equipped weapon always has 000/000, or 000/max ammo upon loading in to a server. Fixed upon switching weapons or reloading.
---
My gatling gun and quad harpoon gun recieved insane magazine counts. My harpoon gun, for instance, briefly had 140 ammo, which were all the harpoons I had on me at the time, that I could fire in quick succession. It eventually went back to the normal 4 mag size. I don't know what cause this to happen, or how it was fixed, but I think it was related to that last bug.
---
Placing two or more of the same type of weapon in the favorite's wheel is buggy, too. Even if they've got different legendary effects, one might disappear from the favorite's menu, and I think there's some issues with ammo, at least with fusion cores and maybe even plasma? I didn't really test it, but I've noticed that switching to and from my bloodied ultracite gatling plasma to my vampire's ultracite gatling plasma gave one the same ammo count as the other, when one had previously had a fully charged fusion core loaded.
---
That's all I can think of at the moment, and that's all just in the past week.
---
They are hesitant to go up against Bethesda because Bethesda strong armed Interplay in court to seize the rest if the rights, specifically the ones that pertained to a Fallout Online that interplay was actively working on. Bethesda dragged them through court several times, cost them a bunch of money, and then used that to force them to settle out of court for 2 million dollars.
---
So they decided the good thing to do was to fuck the players.
---
You are dismissed, Agatha.
---
If you see a lot of people spawning right around you then you have no choice but to run like hell and use your invisibility time to get the fuck out of there. 
---
You can find weapons somewhere else
---
My man knows what's up ☝😎
---
I get these too.
---
&gt; and reported it directly to the community managers...
---
And that is wrong.  You find a bug you make a bug report.  Maybe after report it to the community managers, but make the bug report first.
---
Bethesda: forget it
---
Racked up back to back solo wins last night, there are a lot of inexperienced players grinding for these rewards which makes it pretty fertile grounds for a crafty solo player I think. I'm going to enjoy this week LOL as long as a dominant squad doesn't make it to the final 10 or so it's wide open and anybody's game.
---
Stingwings, bloatflies, bloodbugs, radroaches, cave crickets, bee swarms, honey beasts.  There may be a few more but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.
---
How does that work? Wouldn’t they still be at the same time?
---
Keep going. Try something else. 
---
Like manning up and do this on your actual Reddit account instead of this troll alt you made. 
---
Have some balls, kid!
---
Don't forget that it'll use up 15% of your camp budget to display them all.
---
10% damage while aiming is pretty “meh”.  There’s not a single gun in the game I’d use with that as the 2nd modifier on it. 
---
The only non-legacy Ultracite or Laser Gatling is use is FFR.
---
Having fun making shit up?
---
It's definitely very Fallout like. Did you ever play the originals?
---
I mean, I don't really care if they add it to the atom shop or just give it straight up in game.
---
They should both not do it. Just make it so that I have to search for them in all the big settlements so I actually have a reason to revisit some of them.
---
Its just nice to have something else to grind except for the same shitty legendarys at the whitesprings
---
I don't know why, but if you have a 20+ minute inactive private server 9/10 times joining it we had 6 minutes left to activate the event.
---
Thank you, Codsworth. Dismissed.
---
Yup. Now post this trash with your actual account instead of this troll alt. 
---
*Oh, but then you might lose some precious Internet points!! Oh noez!!*
---
There are still ways to make a true floating base, without having it attached to the ground. I had one in the same location near WS for a while.
---
You can jump in vats if you change your keybinds.
---
Thank you for boosting my comments and visibility, brother 👊😎
---
You skipped a letter. What do you have for ‘B’?
---
That is lame I was looking into getting it for trading to people that couldn’t get them but I guess I’ll just work for the pumpkin armor then
---
It's not isolated private. I have one character where the pro snap camera consistently unfavorites itself every time I log in. My alternate character never has a problem. So far it's only been the pro snap camera so maybe it's an entirely different bug related to the camera itself. IDK but I don't use private server.
---
Dismissed, Todd.
---
Also it's smaller than FO76 and new Vegas and not online lol. It's great but I wouldn't have even heard of this if fo76 hadn't been problematic.
---
As far as thematically, absolutely. Its right on up there with Borderlands in how the universe is shaped up with the corporations running planets/settlements.
---
Is this a 1st member exclusive? Or can 2nd members get this too?
---
Oh, I’d make this post a sticky if I could. 
---
More people need a good laugh at your obvious shitposting.
---
Yes. They added some content. Still, the amount of crashes, disconnects, and bugs is mind boggling.
---
What do they do to modify their controllers, shouldn't it be the same for any controller and on Xbox? just curious.
---
If they're a 10% drop the probability of not getting one after 50 runs is 0.5%.
---
I doubt the drop is close to 10%
---
Ah, your old standard fallback. 
---
Your lack of creativity is impressive.
---
Dale a tu cuerpo alegria macarena
---
Yeah, I gathered. Saw somebody on the Xbox LFG thing a few weeks back offering up 3-5K for a forest one, was floored by that shit and just tossed them my extra forest from my stash and told them to spend the caps on something more useful cuz that's ridiculous for something that used to permanently occupy a vendor, and then messed up and scrapped my own forest mask at the beginning of the event last week, decided to finally investigate a bit.
---
My sentiment exactly.
---
I did it 30 times, crashed once, maybe twice. Ps4.
---
I like that they can't be traded. 
---
Nuclear Winter rewards should be considered trophies. If you didn't do the work you shouldn't be able to flaunt the rewards. 
---
It's like the assholes that buy tshirts to concerts they didn't go to.
---
The concern with Google was that in order to maintain a single vote per person the vote had to be configured to require you to log into your Google account. I figured that more people would object to that rather than this.
---
damn, you're fucking dumb
---
Very cool. I dream of a having a camp that high up. I wonder how they did it?
---
Have you received one recently or do you know what level you were when you got it?
---
Well obviously those people who bought it are winning so much they are willing to share with the rest of us.  And as a humble peasant I thank you my kind and benevolent benefactors for paying for me to win as well.
---
Yes, you have been dismissed, Hodd. You may go now.
---
I got mine probably 3-4 months ago.... if I remember correctly drop chance is .05!
---
I play with a team and I converted them to Unyielding for all the benefits and damage, but these bugs are experienced by all of us. It really sucks Bethesda does not fix bugs for 6 months.
---
Eres necrofilico? Yikes bruh
---
&gt;chance
---
That's not probability
---
I got the pirate costume 2nd run lol T\_T I feel bad, had no clue it was rare til I was browsing here bc I put the game down for ages and decided to play this weekend.
---
I dunno, I've run a handful of surveys over the last few years and have never been paywalled. :/  
---
It's an incredibly basic service.
---
Lol
---
We already covered you being dismissed, Hodd. I'm sorry you don't understand.
---
Ah! Fair enough. I was hopping the sheepsquatch add on’s we’re going to do that. Has Bethesda said anything about what they plan on doing with the other vaults? Slim slim hope still haha.
---
Keep it up with that mentality. That 'll get you everywhere in life.
---
It's not that hard to understand. Obsidian developed New Vegas, arguably (but not really) the best of the modern Fallout entries, and include members of Black Isle who originally created Fallout. Due to the lacklustre response to 4 and 76, The Outer Worlds is giving fans of Fallout what they want from Fallout.
---
It's really not that hard to understand if you give it a long, hard think.
---
Dismissed, necro
---
drop chance 10%, why you doubt it while it was datamined?
---
dont know why you get downvoted. modding consoles is totally do able
---
I bought my responders fireman outfit for 5k (this was *way* before the price went up for the set), but I did manage to get another helmet as a drop from Patrol Duty. I was around Level 90 when that dropped, so rewards shouldn't be restricted by level
---
Many months ago I got it from one of the beginning responders quest on a heavy character I was leveling, if I’m not mistaken. I wanna say Thirst Things First?
---
Fue lo suficientemente bueno para tu padre.
---
Fue lo suficientemente bueno para tu perro
---
Translation - I'm talking out my butt and have no basis for anything I'm saying.
---
We know, Hodd. We know.
---
Atom shop
---
.
---
Eh, it is it's own game but it IS very similar in formula to New Vegas. That said,  I think it improves on the gameplay and mechanics of New Vegas in every way possible. Haven't finished it yet so I can't comment on the story, but I will say that it's definitely keeping me interested.
---
Sorry, but saying dismissed doesn't make me go away. Grow up pal.
---
“Vault Tec Bed 2” is the plan name
---
Great work.
---
For what it's worth, Manhunt is mainly good for caps.  It's usually a reward of 150, give or take.  And, for whatever reason, it's started triggering a lot more frequently with the latest patch.
---
Dismissed, Agatha.
---
they didn't forget, they just have not figured out how much to charge yet.
---
Do the recipes for those drop, or can I buy them?
---
Don't expect much from this game anymore. Beth are probably already winding down development. Wastelanders likely has a skeleton crew making sure it won't set consoles on fire when it releases. The bare minimum, which is all this game ever got.
---
Allow you to permanently stealth and abuse mister sandman perk.
---
I got the Leather Coat from Idle Explosives last week. No screenshots of me getting it though.
---
There are other beds available, that don’t require the atom shop... they are in game plans... I have a few I believe, if you’re on PS4.... other wise there are a few for sale from the Winterspring vendors
---
Ok boomer
---
Care to elaborate?
---
It's hilarious and yet extremely stupid how you just don't get such a simple concept. News flash, Hodd, you have no power over others. Saying dismissed just make you an idiot who cannot defend what they've said. Because what they've said is stupid.
---
Yes I’ve experienced the gouls on the ground before, and the loading In with zero ammo in the chamber but i can’t say I’ve experienced the others, I don’t use PA or heavy guns but that massive magazine bug on the harpoon gun sounds brilliant lol. 
---
What do you think with regards to playability has there been much improvement since launch or is it still as buggy as it was in the first couple of months?
---
Take no damage. Deal lots of damage.
---
Have to win them from Biv
---
I have a higher level character who has done very few of the main quests and faction based quests - only done enough to launch nukes and get into the higher levels of the asylum. My original main character has done all of those quests though. As an extreme, the one character hasn’t even been to the first overseers camp; this is the character I will likely use to farm events.
---
Hail yourself!
---
Vault tec bed 2, available from Pendleton at the whitespring.
---
Tu madre estaba mejor en la cama cuando era un cadáver que cuando estaba viva.
---
Then there's something else at play as what i said is absolutely true.
---
Thank you for responding! Any idea how long ago that was?
---
Couldn't care less so long as you pound sand as soon as you get it.
---
I mean only a sociopath would lurk on a sub for a game they got refunded...
---
Yeah that’s a big one in my book.
---
I am, thank you 😉
---
My buddy farmed the two beginning Responder’s quest on a new account (deleting and restarting over and over) about 50 times for the helmet, and I wanna saaaaay 70ish times for the body?
---
If you run while in VATS then attack you'll do a power attack. I often do short sprints to an enemy and end with a power attack with my melee character
---
What did Fallout 76 do for players for its very first thanksgiving and Xmas last year, up to just one month after it’s exciting launch with that dedicated team supporting it behind the scenes? New Events? Nope. Music? Nope. Snowy weather or effects? Nope. A different loading screen even? Nope. Oh that’s right, we got more overpriced crap in the Atom Shop including those emotes that were just reskinned. I wouldn’t hold your breath, and even if they did announce something it would probably be (i) delayed to Q1 and (ii) bugged lol.
---
Yeah the community deserves so much better
---
This (the helmet drop) was back in July, while the outfit I bought back in March.
---
More than a year later and it's still not working good. So... You're wrong.
---
Thanks!
---
Na, the game launching on steam at the same time is going to see a surge in revenue
---
I’ve got it from Strange Brew about a month ago. Never bothered with the dailies until they started giving you scrip. I’ve got quite a few rare outfits from doing them too.
---
I got the pantsuit, the short suit, and the Whitespring jumpsuit. Bought the pirate hat from a vendor. On the hunt now for the rest!!
---
Also, this may help.

---
Pretty sure it's an unpopular opinion, but why would you even want them to implement recycled, zero effort features from past titles that Bethesda will, let's be honest, pretty sure put a real money price tag on? I just don't get it, this entire game is a cash grab from the start and you even encourage this.
---
Yes, I'm done with the game but that's not the point. I don't want to forbid your opinion, I'm just curious. And everything that happens now will influence other BGS titles.
---
Any idea what level you were when it dropped from Strange Brew?
---
Duplicating items isn’t cheating?
---
Outer Worlds is highly comparable to Fallout New Vegas and therefore the Fallout series as a whole. I recommend playing all of them so you can see the similarities. 
---
Outer Worlds is itching that Fallout scratch for much of the fan base. It’s not all just anti-Bethesda hype, Outer Worlds shows that Obsidian would do a bang up job on another New Vegas-like game if Bethesda will sub it out to them.
---
About 260
---
I want my mobility back. Please fix jetpacks!
---
That would be nice, I would also like to see the collectable cars and trucks from the FO4 mods. That was great
---
You got really unlucky with monongah then cause i get ghouls every time. But thank for the information. I always avoided lode baring but now i won't.
---
BGS devs are extremely lazy when it comes to event reward %'s. They just make it prohibitivly low chances at rare items, with no conditions to improve them.

It feels like you guys are quick to ban people who want to help the community and show your exploits and how they work so you can fix the game but take you sweet ass time to ban people who are blatantly hacking, duping, glitching and ruining the game for others.
---
I’m almost starting to feel sorry for the kid, typing the same thing over and over, furious at his keyboard and angry he can’t come up with anything better as a retort. 
---
*Almost

Honestly, I would love for Bethesda to see this and take it to heart. New collectibles would be awesome, and would be a fun addition. I honestly love this idea.
---
The fixer uses standard combat rifle mods 👍

Scrap combat rifles

Not being able to straight up craft plain Nuka Cola prevents me from carrying 200+ Nuka Grenades and lobbing them at every enemy I come across. Since I can admit I have no self control I think it be best it remains a rare find.
---
Gunsmith and weapon Artisan. I can go  weeks without repairing.
---
That would be awesome thanks
---
You want the simple modern bed plan, it's the nice one with the blue vault tec sheets.
---
You understand
---
I'm a simple man. I see an open junk extractor or scavenger bot, I take it all to fill my 1st class scrap box
---
No one wants to deal with spoiled junk
---
They told me to fix it on PS4 that I needed to delete my game and reinstall it. No clue why that would fix it, as it seems more like a server issue. 
---
I did as they requested and it actually made my game run worse and didn’t resolve the issue. 
---
I let them know this and all they did was close my ticket. Thanks Bethesda!
---
Thanks! This may be the most recent view shared thus far for a high level character. Was this a random quest or were you farming this one?
---
I received one by completing “Back on the Beat” about a month ago.  I was around Level 175 or so if that means anything.
---
They are not going to let you place atom shop items in friends camps for obvious reasons.
---
I would stick to the same timeframe as yesterday to keep it as close to the same terms as the last one. I know there are significantly less votes than the one from yesterday but given you have been averaging aprox 300 votes per hour putting it up for a couple more hours isn’t going to have that large of an effect as I imagine the rate of votes has dropped and will continue to drop the longer it goes on.
---
Update if you manage to return it please.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I’m looking to confirm! Were you farming the event or just randomly did this one? Some prior numbers point to a 0.05% drop rate so trying to see if anyone had specific experience farming.
---
its not missed, its waiting its turn to show up behind the paywall
---
Grape is the only one I even bother drinking.
---
My original ticket which i made long time ago was also closed without resolving. This time i will try for atoms to be refunded and i wonder how it resolve now. I asked for atoms refund once for a item which was not working and them they refunded me and allowed me to keep it so refund department might be more helpful than technical one.
---
Wow I recognize those emojis. There's another astroturd who used those. Mmm what was it, Tetrinox?
---
Only you and your friends can make the game interesting. For many, that is the only reason they're still playing. Do not expect any new 'free' content soon. Do not expect any free content that 'just works' EVER. Only atom shop and FU1st services will get new content that is acceptable. BGS will not improve this game, only you and your friends can. Sad truth, but truth nonetheless.
---
It has always baffled me how it’s got this far. When you have a dedicated community that will pay full price for whatever they put out, why would they take advantage of that? Before 76’s release there was a resounding plea for a remaster of FNV, I cannot imagine this was an impossible ask and I guarantee it would have been far more profitable than this, with the added bonus of keeping their reputation in tact. Makes me sad knowing this is likely the end of (good) fallout.
---
thanks!
---
It was random when I logged in but I do get it every day.
---
what are you smoking my dude? have you been under a rock or something? the game is fucking broken bethesda's austin underpaid small team CAN'T EVEN KEEP UP WITH THE BUGS in game and you there hitting the crack pipe thinking something like this would be done? come back to the real world man stop dreaming how about " 
---
# Fallout 76 patch 15 suggestions: FIX ON THE HUNDREDS OF BUGS AND SERVER STABILITY ISSUES
---
and after that we can focus on gimmicky suggestions....i guess you must be new on the sub...this is just ANOTHER suggestion that will never happen (like probably thousands of other suggestions like yours) and only takes the community's and bethesda's focus out of the problems of the game
---
Thank you again!!!
---
Yeah I mean I beat that shit in two days and then was like wtf? That’s it?
---
You think, my man? 😎👉👉
---
lol how many alt accounts do you even use?
---
How about for a minigun? TSE doesn’t sound bad.
---
So, let’s keep that one just for me. I see you calling other people ‘necro’ elsewhere. 
---
It makes sense here. It makes absolutely no sense when you use it on anyone else. 
---
Maybe your having trouble typing within those years of impotent rage in your eyes. 
---
*’Mom!! I keep telling them they are dismissed, but they aren’t going away!!’*

*’Oh, no, poopykins!  What can I do to help?’*

*’Well... -sniff-... I could use some more Hot Pockets...’*
---
*’Oh, I’m sorry sweetums, we’re all out and besides... I’m dead and never loved you.’*
---
it happened to me at least twice last night and in one case a very clear hacker had just killed me. I death spectated him jumping around spinning shooting into buildings and the air and somehow killing people. after death spectating him I got a pop-up of using modified files.
---
I have modified nothing since I started playing in beta.
---
I stay on my private server for that reason. I only joined public for mischief night.
---
We'll see soon, but I am going to hazard a guess here and say we will see monthly "free" items added for Firsts. Which I would also guess may include said items you mentioned. I mean they'll want to keep us happy now to keep the monthly checks coming.
---
Agreed. I was looking forward to it but I think it got overhyped. It feels like a poorly done space dlc for new vegas.
---
Then why are you here? Lmao what a joke you are.
---
Heh, on my own pacifist run i mostly hide in pulavski shelters. Once a group of 4 camped near me for 5 minutes without even checking the interior.
---
I agree Mass Effect + Bio Shock is a good analogy.  I have enjoyed the game, but it was very over-hyped, but that is not its fault.
---
A question. Did you play NW lately?
---
You’re welcome
---
They all submit tickets , it would have been less insulting to just not reply.
---
It’s probably because your interactions with another person in Fallout is more personal Because there’s only 2-3 of you &amp; you probably haven’t seen a person for the majority of the time you’ve spent playing
---
Wait whats are the approved costumes? I wore skeleton for a while but then switched to the slasher one.
---
Aquaboy reporting in, nothing more fun than swimming up and down the rivers laughing at the land walkers and their silly deathmatch.
---
I've gotten the hat and outift twice, gave the second set to my fiancee, and I've got another hat. It's a super rare drop a guess .
---
It's like the og fallouts 3 and new vegas where character build matters rpg wise and conversations matter. It's not just a shoot and loot like 76 became.
---
Yes i was in session when the bug occured. Acording to some guys on reddit NW is responsible for that bug.
---
I'm on PC and have a spare short pumpkin suit you can have, if you'd like.
---
So no you don't actually know for a fact the dataminers are wrong you're juat assuming based on what is considered best common practice. Hate to point out Bethesda has failed with best common practice nearly a half dozen times with major parts of this game, from using frame rate to control speed/physics, lack of anticheat software, version control with patch implementation, etc.
---
So at this point, using best common practice as the default way of assuming that is how they did something in this game is pointless as they've regularly shown they don't follow common practices even for things that a first year programmer knows better. Seriously how do you fuck up version control of your patches MULTIPLE times?
---
Are you PS4?  Asking b/c the mobster plan is the one I didn't get.  Have 2nd plans for some other  pumpkins I'll trade.
---
Sadly they will not refund atoms for that. 
---
I asked them to give me atoms for all the missed dailies I missed due to their screwup with not allowing me to do the daily quests and they pretty much said no and to shove it.
---
That billboard is such a tease
---
Yes, for only 12 dollars, it can be yours. Or maybe just for Fallout Worst members, time will tell.
---
Yeah seems like there's an issue with NW
---
FFS, there is a large contingent on here that seems to want zero challenge or consequences in this game.
---
ah this is good to know thank you
---
On my character its been fine when I go to a public server but when I go to a private one, it messes up. The one for the camera sounds like a completely different bug. I have a bug with the camera too but its not near as bad as this one with the weapon wheel.
---
Outer Worlds is a non-fantasy, single player, action RPG with actual RPG mechanics, which is pretty rare. Fallout 3 and New Vegas were also those things, Fallout 4 was a bit lacking on the RPG side, but still close. 76 being an online game is a total departure—though I enjoy it immensely. 
---
People love to compare things in black and white terms, they love to see ‘Winners and losers”. Fallout 76 rubs a lot of people the wrong way, for both valid and invalid reasons. For the people who hate it, it’s easy to fall into this weird game fan tribalism thing, despite it making very little sense. 
---
Outer Worlds, despite sharing similar mechanics and some themes that are similar to earlier Fallout games, is really not comparable to Fallout 76. It’s just popular to do so because OW is new, made by the creators of Fallout and FO76 is popular to dump on. Outer Worlds is a fantastic game, but it isn’t the kind of game that will pull anyone away from a live, online game permanently—nor is it intended to be. 
---
Too many gamers forget that it’s perfectly fine to enjoy more than one game. Am I taking a break from 76 to play OW? Absolutely. But eventually I’ll be done with it and will be back.
---
Omg ahh that's to awesome ♡♡♡ group request sent ;) I love the photo mode of fo76 def have some good ones haha. If only they'd give us more that 50 photos though ugghh, strugglebus 😭
---
Damn, well thanks for saving me a trouble of making a ticket.
---
That explains why I knew all the mods when I got the plan. Made 20 fixers to scrap and realized I could not scrap them and then noticed I had all the mods.
---
Main reason to compare is one of the original game makers of fallout series helped make it and obsidian also made one of the most beloved Fallout games Fallout New Vegas and those are the core reasons they compare since it drew inspiration from the beloved sections of the Fallout series.
---
I wore either Tin Foil hat or Fasnacht Mask every time but I just got pumpkin plans and pumpkin grenades. Kinda fun event but rewards were trash, as usual. Back to playing other games while I wait for new content.
---
Ever heard of playing solo?....
---
I paid 10k 5.56 for mine.
---
"16-times the monetization"
---
2018 Todd Howard.
---
I wonder if it’s the possibility of dealing with assholes, raiders, or griefers.
---
The vast majority of people I’ve run into I. Game have been nice or at least dent. There are a few assholes but on average I see one ann B out once a week (and I play on and off throughout the day everyday). 
---
I usually only chat with two types of people; low levels to ask if they need any basic supplies or plans and people who are checking out my vending machines if I happen to be at my base to ask if they are looking for something in particular.
---
Yeah, I was really confused when they added a Battle Royale game mode and not a Zombies game mode. I get that BR is the "trendy" thing, but 76 seems ready built for a co-op horde mode.
---
Drops 1-6 players on an empty map and then sends waves of enemies. The players collect scrap and try to cobble a base together with the drops from each wave...
---
Ssssssssssh’s in dolphin
---
I am sorry my lack of loot bag either upset or confused you. Lol. 
---
I've been doing a run of nude pacifist matches lately, which I guess makes me more of a pervert than a pacifist. It's always funny to watch them look around for a death bag before realizing I didn't have a single item on me. No clothes means no pockets to store inventory in, sorry about that killer.
---
I have found hackers can’t shoot you underwater as well as they’d like
---
They will release something they label wastelanders. It will be 15 minutes of content and a premium hat
---
They broke luck of the draw months ago. It used to hit all the time now it never does.
---
I know skeleton is 100% approved. I also know that some of the atomic items were not approved. I'll try to find the datamine again
---
I leave mine unlocked on purpose, as well as my extractor and Water purifiers. Help yourself.
---
The worst thing about this is that the site doesn't work in the Wayback Machine (at least, it doesn't for me). This website is pretty much gone *for good.*
---
Duplicating? He just has a bunch of vending machines
---
Is that possible to include craftable outfits too?
---
It was fun you can see the confusion as they look around.
---
I didn't realize you can lock just the terminal, cool.
---
I thought for sure it was in game somewhere :(
---
Sure the drop rates are the drop rates. However the event could still be bugged. A person could have horrible luck or the event could be buggy or both. The only way to tell if an event is dropping a rare item is to ask on here. And then you have to decide if you want to trust the guy who says he got 9 rare items and it's just your bad luck the game works fine. All im saying is alot of quests/events/challenges are obviously bugged. So why are we so certain that these work as advertised?
---
Ha! You all wanna be overseer while i'm here chilling with my fish crew!
---
Best part was expecting bethesda to get their shit together, imo. Fat chance
---
Maybe we can get some extra camp build budget so I can actually place them too!
---
I tried that at first, they looked a few times and I got shot through the walls a few other times. It was funny when they opened it and were like !!!! A person is in here?!
---
And how do you know an item is duped? How is it obvious?
---
You'll still get card packs every 5th level.
---
Now you get to fine tune your build.  
---
As you roam the higher level areas, you'll probably find a few deficiencies to fix.
---
As you obtain better weapons and armor, you'll tweak your perks to suit them.
---
I feel you, but I think it was delayed til wastelanders.
---
Oh man that might explain why i got one rare suit all night of running this.
---
Eh NV is the popular one on reddit fallout sub for PC crowd.  If your console or vanilla dlc it's a solid "ok" game, was around 7/10 on most reviews.
---
People who preordered should get free private servers, especially since the bags were a rip off and the helmets were moldy.  Everything that came with the pre order sucked.  At least compensate with a free private server.
---
She got a chuckle out of that. Probably for the many hours she put in trying to get that plan.
---
Obviously it didn't work. Even if they had no microtransactions it was still super bare bones.
---
And just because people want it doesn't make it a good idea.
---
I had the fortune or misfortune of rolling three fireman outfits in a row switched characters got nothing good
---
Still hoping by some chance they release that at least. Lol
---
On the occasion, but they are few and far between now. Most of the time I just relaunch and it's fixed.
---
Does grape take away mutations?
---
I literally got 6 clean spacesuit helmets in a row and pumpkin plans. To add injury to insult,  I ran the clubhouse after one event, and there sitting in the locker in the basement,  clean spacesuit helmet. Aargh. I got the fireman suit,  that's it. Really frustrating.
---
I think Bethesda should inplement a high level game mode. A survival mode with enemys at least 10 levels above yours, more events on tje map at the same time, more legendays spawning in it, more effective nuke zones (more nuked flora but more radiations), and dedicated challenges that gives cosmetics to your weapons. That could be the high level experience players want. Idk.
---
Should just be able to server hop. Works for me every time.
---
After playing The Outer Worlds for a while, it just reminds me of Firefly (unreliable, vicar, parvati) and Babylon 5 (iconoclasts/minbari)
---
suggestion: could you add a rarity list to it?
---
You mean like those you've been bandying about throughout this whole thread?
---
The ability should be included in Fire in the hole perk at minimum, otherwise it should be default. Or at least make their physics a little bit more reasonable.
---
It’ll be 1650
---
My man knows what's up 😎👉👉
---
Hey gotta pay that sub fee somehow
---
Because they where very neat ands original collectables, and by that logic they shouldn't even make a second installment of any type of game, by that reason V.A.T.S would have been scrapped after fallout 1.
---
Thats just shit logic there buddy, people love nostalgia and if it ain't broken don't fix it.
---
You can have it for another 13$ a month bro 😎
---
I've got pirate costume! Yarrrrrrrrr, matey!
---
I was wrong, it's not tied to wastelanders. It's in a little footnote at the bottom of [the post where they delayed Wastelanders](https://bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more):  
---
&gt;"We’re also still working on new events, the Legendary Player system, a public test server, perk loadouts, and so much more to come. "  
---
So I guess it's not impossible. Hope for the best, prep for the worst I suppose.
---
So fucking true. We preordered and paid 80 dollars and then like 2 weeks later it was 30-40 bucks at gamestops. We love the game but holy hell this team is shite.
---
Some people sell their excess costumes to the station bot. I've found the firefighter outfit and even a fasnatch mask the other day.
---
Accuracy is still bad. Unless you like to get right in the face of your enemies.  
---
I’d rather have Furious, Vampires, Executioners, Bloodied, Junkies, Anti Armor, etc.
---
You should repeat the same thing with all of your alt accounts so we can get them out in the open. I'll be able to recognize you from the For Honor posts don't worry
---
Find a good gauss rifle and prime it. That will end your scorchbeasts problem.
---
I thought it was just the nuka cola themed helmets that were moldy
---
You should visit Freddy Fear's House of Scares. I found few costumes inside the building.
---
IMPORTANT ! If you're the victim of some nasty freeze in wich case you can do almost nothing else than closing your computer by force or restart session with windows you need this : Open task manager and find the option to put it "Always on top" it's simple, and effective to help you trough a lots of issues and even outside of Fallout 76.
---
Bugs tends to vary from both platforms and computers components, on my side i still get a few, i'll mark a "\*" in case of bugs you can "fix" by yourself if you get the same as me.
---
my character is ressurected but still has the option to respawn \*1
---
Legacy energy explosive weapons and strangler heart power armor freeze \*2
---
Some npc's may have a sound loop on death
---
A rare one is when you fast travel to a location and end up somewhere esle...
---
A small rare graphic bug with the gauss rifle, putting the weapon down make it still appear in your hand.
---
Sometime when you kill a thing, the body dissapear instantly, it's in fact the body becoming a meat pile but at the inital spawn of the monster, so you have to search a bit and you'll find it back...maybe
---
Now the fixes i got in order  to fight off some :
---
1) If you're not overweight, press space and fast travel, if you are a bit overweight you will need someone to share a perk to you or you'll have to restart game...It happen mostly to blood builds, always make sure you're not carrying too much in general if you're subject to this bug, i know it's hard but it's going to save you a few ragequits
---
2) In case of such freeze ( with a sound loop ) don't alt f4 right away, there's a lots of chance your computer can recover from it when you open task manager ( might requires a few attempts )
---
Stability has been increased. In the beta it was a stuttery, endlessly crashing mess. I'm pretty sure they fixed one of the biggest bugs, which was getting stuck or crashing while entering/exiting power armor.
---
You can also run two events per hour on public servers, if the first gets done in about seven minutes there's a good chance the next server will still be running it when you join
---
Really thank you man :) sadly im on ps4. I dont think i can move points from strenght to agility? Or is there a way?
---
Didn't know this, I'll look into this. Thanks for the info!
---
Agreed. I imagine a lot of votes came because it was the weekend as well.
---
Cola Nut. Craftable Nuka Colas? Hell yes.
---
the wheel bug is definitively not private world exclusive.
---
its been happening for months now hell i was getting in literally 35minutes ago on a PUBLIC server so it kinda debunks your theory of isolation.
---
IMHO, vats for melee in 76 should have been more of a target lock like in other melee focused games like Dark Souls. For guns, it's basically an aim assist, which is fine, but in melee if you use it at all, you have to constantly switch in and out of vats to get anything done. You can't block in vats, you can't power attach in vats, you can't even do things like target body parts like you can with guns (Why can't I do a leg sweep with a baseball bat and use that limb damage bonus on my weapons?). Also, sometimes vats just fails, you'll have action points and try to do a critical, but nothing will happen until you cancel vats and go back into it. I've had this happen countless times on the SBQ. Most of the time, I just don't use vats, but when I've got other players to contend with or lots of ghouls flopping around, I just toggle vats on and off after each hit, which is a pain, but gets the job done. It would be nice if they would have ported some of Skyrim's melee combat to Fallout 4/76.
---
If you feel that way and think it is an issue use the game as an opportunity to work on yourself. Say Hi or something.  
---
Most often others don't have a Mic from my experience. To some extent I feel yah, I don't generally like talking to people. Occasionally I will but not if i've been on my on solo for a couple hours.
---
Yall still playing this ?
---
They don't use the power attack animation and are faster than them, so I believe they are not power attacks
---
Rare drop from enclave events
---
IMHO these are not rumors but a logical extrapolation of the current situation.  
---
**They will** introduce more "convenience items".
---
**They will** introduce actual pay 2 win content. Mark my words.
---
**They will** ignore negative outcry from the community.
---
What will happen when they do put out these items? People will be outraged here. Many of the same people will buy it anyway because it gives an advantage. BGS will interpret the sales of those items and conclude the community likes them, as they did with the fridge. 
---
Can we actually do something about it? I do not think so. The direction of this game is set. BGS doesn't listen if it doesn't directly create revenue. What you call 'listening to us' is VERY VERY selective.
---
What will I do when they do? Depends on how close to pay2win it gets. Worse case scenario is that I quit and am infuriated enough to spend some time trolling game review sites like metacritic.
---
I like this idea. Bringing back real collectibles, like how Bobbleheads used to be would be a cool thing to flex on the rest of FO76.
---
I've had multiple of everything but didn't get the only thing I truly wanted, which is the Whitespring jumpsuit.
---
When I need them to stay there, I use molotovs. The bouncing Is great indoors, in Places like sugar grove.
---
Yeah I feel you on the hoarder front... I got obsessed for a bit by "needing" to complete a full Urban Scout / Unyielding set and my daily grind became the misadventures of vendor hopping for hours on end. I did finally get everything, but it completely derailed any kind of normal gameplay for a week or so.
---
And my Axe.
---
My scenario isn't an option, so I picked the one I'm leaning towards.
---
Yes, but I'd like to be able to power attack while sneaking. You can't change your stance in VATS because that will close it. Someone mentioned that you can change key binds to be able to jump while in VATS. I wonder if you can do the same to be able to change your stance while in VATS.
---
Bloodied rifle build or even bloodied heavy gun (as I am) why spend more bullets than you need 😉
---
Don't really play NW didn't know you could fly solo.
---
Not against mirelurks queens and SB crop-dusting you aren't lol
---
The first three of them don't happen in a private server, generally. I did experience the fast-travel problem on a private server that had 8 people in it, all with extensive camps, and after three nuke launches. But if I'm alone on mine, they never occur. That leads me to believe that it's a server issue, like they need to be recycled more often than they are (or the server-side code has some godawful memory leaks).
---
Thanks for the suggestion, Todd!
---
Finally the saga of Beefytrout the Fixer has a happy ending! :( Sorry I wasn't able to get you one myself. See you at Mole Mama, hope you saved up a good chunk of scrip
---
Ive gotten one from dogwood die off.
---
I'd argue it's more Knights of the Old Republic 2 than Mass Effect. Though Mass Effect was very similar in core gameplay design to how KOTR was setup.
---
I think we all lost faith in fallout but most people will still buy the next game bethesda makes i mean look at halo, halo 4 and 5 sucked but people will still buy the next one every time it comes out.
---
You failed to mention the downside: a mirelurk spawn will freakin' clap your cheeks if you don't see it.
---
I'd argue that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges.I'd argue that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges.
---
That could be but either way we should get some sort of compensation
---
We should be able to craft canned dog food as well, since we can get cans and meat. Heck, even make it only dog meat in the cans to really be morbid about it. They call it "dog food" not because it's food for dogs, but food **from** dogs.
---
No problem that will be $13 please
---
I'm honestly not sure, you could be right. Can't find a definitive answer on it either.
---
I DID find, however, that you can animation cancel melee attacks, similar to how it's done in ESO, by pushing the block button immediately after the swing makes contact, and then immediately hit the swing button again.
---
If you know what to do you can solo that event and only have to fight ghouls and the sentry at the end.
---
No, but I have lost faith in English teachers.
---
Vats them. You can throw it where you want, target it in VATS, and shoot it where you want it to detonate.
---
That’s honestly what I’ve been thinking
---
Speak for yourself. I lost zero faith in fallout so don’t speak for “all” of us thanks. :)
---
Oh this thread again.
---
If hey released a video statement where Zenimax top people and Todd And Hines said they aren’t sorry for the handling of this game, but they are working on a brand new engine for a 76 sequel where they will not make the same mistakes again, then maybe I would consider playing another Bethesda Fallout game.
---
76 is a decent time waster, but my word it could have been such amazing fun with a better engine and better support.
---
This should be for Fallout First exclusively you guys should thank us for financially supporting your broke asses.
---
I've heard of people doing that, but I'm just not that gifted.
---
Now I know what I'm doing in NW. Pacifist ftw.
---
i know if you are not wearing an approved costume, the game will have a quest listing/prompt on screen at all times letting you know you need to equip a costume, so if you didnt see that message, then you are ok!
---
Wait
---
They put in a new map and removed the old one? Why???
---
You’re dismissed, Agatha.
---
Yes, to a huge degree. Keep your eyes on Obsidian from now on. They look like they are filling the void perfectly. They made New Vegas and have recently release The Outer Worlds which are two nearly perfect games that shine in all the same places that Bethesda used to. Their next game is 100% on the top of my list, while Bethesda has literally made me lower my expectations for TES VI to the point of apathetic semi-acknowledgment. They are going to have to really pull no punches when it comes to whatever they do next, because between Skyrim and 76, it looks like the company is just becoming a “fans-only” normie platitude fest now with added microtransactions. I’m really not looking forward to it.
---
Maybe after they fix all those duping problems? Sorry to break your balls but 'rare' items are often the target for mass duping so nothing's rare really. There are extremely rare outfits like leather coat that has a drop rate of 0.2% or 0.02% if you complete an event. Well they are everywhere and are actively traded around in the market
---
I honestly enjoy Fallout 3 and New Vegas on console more, the gunplay feels better.
---
if you are on Ps4 im down to buy the extras!
---
really?
---
Really. 😐
---
Another point on a TSE Minigun...You need to get close to the enemy to make sure you hit it, but if you get too close you’ll blow yourself up.  And Fireproof can only do so much with a high fire rate gun.
---
Ur still playing this game?
---
oh is babby formed? how does girl get pragnant?
---
I haven't played KOTR 2 due to my Xbox kept shitting itself with KOTR 1, so I have no idea how those games felt.
---
There is a workaround for this, but it's difficult to do for consecutive hits. Simply power attack outside of VATS and then quickly use VATS.
---
They could be a non-English speaker
---
I know this fiasco has tainted me about preorders for sure.. not only for Bethesda's games. When another game comes that raises my eyebrow, I certainly will jump ship. I cant believe that they chose to put new content before bug fixes. I routinely crash 3 times an hour a year after release!
---
The only statements from the "dataminers" about "seeds" being fixed or account based and their extraordinary claims about the effects that might have appear to be pure speculation, based on no actual "datamining", other than the fact that the executable contains functions with "seed" in the name.
---
What you describe as "best common practice" is literally "how PRNGDs work".
---
but everytime you feel anxious you just gotta remember you got 100+ clannies follow you til death
---
That "speed hack" built into cheat engine tends to not work in most games. It literally speeds the process up as a whole. This can cause clock issues that typically cause multiplayer games to lose sync with the server and kick you. What you would really want to do is single out memory addresses for the movement speed, firing speed, acceleration, etc and edit those values specifically. That being said there are fairly easy ways to obscure those memory addresses that should be implemented in a game like this not to mention anti cheat software.
---
Great list of issues that need some work, with one disagreement: it's Battle Royale. Getting to the winner's circle/last Vault-Dweller standing is the victory condition. Defeating other players is one way to do that, sure...but it's not the only (or even best way, until the end.) That being said, I'm all for more incentives to engage other players.
---
It isn't really that complicated. I would say that killing a SB is harder. 
---
If you can deal with the gouls and be able to take out the sentry at the end, I'm more than happy to tell you the the 3 steps for the event. Just in case you didn't know it already.
---
Collecting things is most of the reason I play these games beyond completing their quests... sometimes it’s even a priority to get the item at the end of a quest more than it is completing the quest itself. 
---
In NV I had all the globes, and at least one of every weapon displayed plus as many uniques as I could get my hands on in the Cocktail Lounge. In Fallout 3 I had all the bobbleheads plus some favorite weapons displayed around the Megaton home. 
---
In Fallout 4, I had all the bobbleheads and all the magazines, plus my most used weapons on the wall along with my favorite power armor at the Red Rocket, then the Mechanists layer held all my extra PA except the Vim suit I kept on Far Harbor and the Nuka T51 I kept at Nuka World.
---
Maybe a little. But I honestly don’t care for Bethesda, I just care about Fallout. If another company bought Fallout from Bethesda, I’d follow Fallout.
---
I was kinda hoping for a solution that benefits non vats users as well.  But being able to vats grenades would work too.  Imho the best players use both vats and manual aim depending on the situation at hand but I know there are some die hards that think vats is no skill mode.
---
i got the fireman costume and pumpkin suit
---
Yeah, having to remove a perk to get one to go around a corner would kinda be a pita, I see your point.
---
He had over one thousand one hundred percent fusion cores. Tell me how he wasn’t cheating? Lol I mean fuck the weight alone.
---
People who still support this game have serious problems, and need to educate themselves in better business practices at the BBB.
---
You really are Todd! When are you going to release Skyrim for the smart fridge, my man?
---
The bigger picture is you don't get to decide what other people enjoy.
---
Ah, a internet troll in its natural habitat.
---
But for real go steal a kids pack of apple juice or slice up an 8 year Olds bike tires. 
---
Its time to cleanse the wasteland of toxic fuckers.
---
Yes, but this only seems to work with melees that have slower animations like 2-handed, and timing seems to play a big part. With medium speed melees like most 1-handed and unarmed, it barely makes them faster.
---
I would like to see a total revamp of explosives.  All of them are just heavy caps waiting to  be sold in my inventory.  I would like to see a nukashine style "dlc".  You discover a hidden ammo depot in the mire full of explosives and new recipies.  IEDs, c4, quick fuse mines, anti PA mines, sticky grenades, tnt etc.   You would have a series of personal/community challenges to uncover said bunker and crack to door code.   Mabye even do a explosive loving securitron to hand out daily's.
---
This post is full of speculation and no facts. It is a useless post and just plain stupid.
---
I never had faith in Bethesda games when it comes to bugs and glitches. They are a bit of an annoyance but manageable with user fixes and mods, even if Bethesda doesn't bother to fix. Sometimes I find myself enjoying hilarity of some glitches. I yuk it up and download unofficial patch of the game and I'm all set. But when it comes to online games like Fallout 76, Bethesda's tendency of 'not bothering to fix' becomes some major major issues and when we got glitches that's sitting there not being fixed for more than half an year is a real pain in the ass. Especially when players can't fix them like they did with other games
---
I don’t know about you, but I like it when future titles tie in those before them in more than just story and setting.
---
Most of my Fallout 4 mods revolve around adding classic fallout items into Fallout 4 to hell make it feel less “distant” from its predecessors. 
---
Snow Globes would be both a unique call back to an older title, and a fun scavenger hunt for players that like that sort of thing,
---
really? like after the launch and dark rum fake bottle and then 100 dollars subscription?
---
Only if we get a radioactive Guy Fawkes today
---
Outfits are what I was thinking this would apply to the most. 
---
Leather Coats are hardly everywhere and tend to cost upwards of 15-25k anymore. Fixer Plans for instance is quite rare and I've had it since who knows when. Only recently with the legendary variants did I find out its not a common drop.  
---
The discussion I wanted to have was would having that rare leather coat which can fetch a good price be better as is, unidentified unless you have knowledge of what it is or would it be more a benefit for it to be identified as rare for less familiar or those who play less.
---
This poll site sucks because it doesn't show the result after voting.
---
Any specific one or just random?
---
Well of course. If it's already a fast weapon, why bother with animation cancelling?
---
&gt;What you describe as "best common practice" is literally "how PRNGDs work".
---
You could literally say the same thing about not tying movement speed to framerates in a online multiplayer game. LOL
---
Right, but it really isn't anything like Fallout thematically which is why I find it a strange comparison to make.
---
You're using it wrong
---
Keep jumping, Toggle vats, keep jumping, circle enemy and hit. You snap to them when you hit. 
---
You'll get them most of the time and they find it hard to hit you since you're spinning around them.
---
You can buy serum recipes, mods for the scout gear from MODUS, or start buying busted weapons from discord. Alternatively yo can just go on a collecting spree of recipes and plans you don’t need but don’t have.
---
You can move points around after level 50 (switch around 1 point per level).
---
Looks like you are around level 45 now.  What you have now is ok - you will be able to optimize it as you go (if you will want to).  
---
Going forward with this character:
---
\- Don't switch points around until you have your Perks optimized
---
\- Put remaining points new points into Agility and Luck.
---
\- After having Perks optimized, gradually shift point from Intelligence to Agility / Luck (there are more useful perks in Strength than in Intelligence)
---
\- Optimize further by gradually switching from Strength to Agility and Luck
---
Should be finished around Level 100  :) This is assuming you will still want a sniper build by then 
---
PS. Your build is much better than most.  And most people (like me) start researching much later (around level 120 for my first character)
---
I could see that being a very cool addition to the game.  Would need more people using explosives though to invest that kind of time and budget.  Hopefully making them more reliable to land damage would get more people to use em.
---
Worst case scenario, buy serum recipes.  Otherwise, buy 5.56 for 1 cap each ot lockpicks.
---
lol and you subbed to FO1st too
---
One of us! One of us!
---
Isn't it over?
---
Was this recently? I was thinking that was a Toxic Valley quest?
---
I definite stopped buying Halo games after Halo:Reach. Halo 3 was the apex, and everyone knows it. No one really ENJOYS the other games, it’s mostly nostalgia. Same for Bethesda; they ruined any respect I had for their company by making everything super accessible and dumbing down their games so they could make more money. Then they added micro transactions, AND broke a lot of promises in regards to those micro transactions. It’s illegitimate, and they should be held accountable. Literally no one but Pete Hines and Todd Howard should be making excuses for them.
---
I actually think it's the opposite. I think they're making more than they expected and are trying to see how far they can go with it. Subscription services encourage further limited development. Things they initially indicated were coming like private servers are now behind a paywall. If they find that people will pay more for it, they can continue development without having to break any real promises. At the very least, it's certainly not shutting down anytime soon.
---
&gt; If they quit giving a shit about this game, I will to
---
Please tell me when they ever really gave a shit about this game?
---
Judging by the rarity, it should cost way more than 25k. I've been playing this game for almost an year now and it's never dropped once for me. These outfits going for mere 25k kinda proves my point. Well that's just my opinion
---
Well, first off, and I just want to start here so it doesn't sound like I'm saying otherwise. No, The Outer Worlds is NOT a Fallout game.   
---
BUT, The Outer Worlds is designed by some of the same people who actually created the Fallout series, and who made Fallout New Vegas, so many of us associate them with the Fallout brand just as much as we associate Bethesda with it.   
---
They created a game about a dystopian society that is absurdist and seems about to utterly collapse and go full on post-apoc. Many of the jokes and themes are very reminiscent of the kind of humor that's used to show the pre-war madness/idiocy/hubris in the Fallout games. So in both cases, those themes are the butt of many jokes. In the horrible company Spacer's Choice, we see the same stupidity and hubris that we associate with Vault-Tec.   
---
The big comparison is popping up in part because while Fallout 76 is a Fallout game, it's the least Fallout game ever in terms of it's themes.   
---
Yes there are great examples of some of the more implicit themes built into the game world, but by stripping out all real NPCs and making the plot be about a dead world, the lion's share of those themes are missing.   
---
To put it bluntly and to really oversimplify, Fallout is about conflict. It's about life growing out of the rubble of the wasteland. It's about war between the old world and the new. The heart of a good Fallout game is, as the intro says "War never changes".   
---
Fallout 76 is not about any of that. There's no war. There's no conflict. Everyone is DEAD. The world is dead. The good guys lost and the horrible monstrosity won and now there's nothing. There's just you fighting against monsters in a world that is basically the "Bad Ending" of a theoretical, much better Fallout game.  
---
So Fallout 76 left MANY fans unhappy and wanting. And then The Outer Worlds comes out with a team of developers associated with the franchise, and showing off so many of the themes that Fallout games usually have. It's not Fallout, but for many people, it's Fallout-ish enough to scratch that itch. And it really REALLY raises a big unspoken question.   
---
If Obsidian can do THIS with The Outer Worlds, **WHY THE HELL COULDN'T BETHESDA DO IT WITH FALLOUT 76?!?**
---
Nicely thought out response and some great points there. Thanks for sharing.
---
Yes that’s a fair point.
---
One is a finished game that's being praised and applauded. 
---
The other is one of the literal worst games ever made.
---
Why would you love Bethesda? They’re a corporation. Not trying to be a dick, just want to know why.
---
I can't speak for everyone else, but from my experience, unfortunately this isn't going to be something we can see in the files we dig into. We typically look into the assets (images, models, and sounds) as well as what's in the ESM. Think of the ESM as a massive settings file that just has all the parameters for all the characters, enemies, items, events, quests, etc. It doesn't control how the game works, just the settings it uses when it does. Anecdotally, I notice a HUGE performance difference between a newly created alt character at level 2 with nothing in its inventory and my main with a full stash and maxed out carry weight. I suspect that the server or the client is spending a lot of effort calculating the weight of all those items, the spoilage of a ton of aid, and the condition of all those weapons and armor, and is causing you to lag enough that the client loses sync with the server and you crash.
---
All that said, if you can consistently reproduce a crash situation, document all the exact steps and file a report with Bethesda support. Maybe make a post here as well so other people can test it out. Sorry I can't be more help.
---
More varied doors, stairs, walla, floors, and foundation sizes would be awesome! I miss those triangle style ones like RUSt has!
---
Where do you get serum recipes anyway?
---
What?! You seriously think someone would dupe fusion cores? You can easily farm those at every power plant 8 an hour at all three plants. Plus you can craft them with super duper. Who ever it is is just using an old unlimited stash glitch before it was patch and an old more than 4 vending machine glitch before it was patched. I wouldn’t say this is cheating for how minor it is compared to the amount of bugs we the players have to deal with on the daily.
---
Thanks, I get your point. I am not against the feature per se, not at all! But regarding the current strategy of BGS, I fear they will only use your passion for older titles to monetize old assets. Wothout even care at all, like they did with the NCR Ranger outfit. They didn't even polish it, they just copied and pasted and opened their hands. Why do old F4 bugs reappear? Because they are in it for the money, not for the game experience. And I'm saying that as a former Bethesda fanboy. I'm utterly disappointed, but I hope you get your wishes come true - without having to pay a huge amount of real money.
---
Medical Wing I think? One of the MODUS terminals.
---
&gt;The Outer Worlds is giving fans of Fallout what they want from Fallout.
---
The only problem with that it didn't scratch any kind of fallout itch for me.
---
 Granted it is a great game but in all honestly it felt like a fallout lite to me.  The maps that they provided were well designed but tiny.  I also felt like I kept looting the same things over and over and over again.  Even on hard mode the game was super simple. I am near the end of my 2nd play through and that will probably be all I will play until the difficulty options can be customized. 
---
  Even though I enjoy both games greatly, Fallout 76 is a much better game in my opinion.
---
&lt;3 \^gets it!!!
---
I think more people would use them if there was more strategy behind them.  The mines are useless with that timer delay.  And if i could set up an ambush with c4 at awol or in the ditches of the bog it would make me start another character.
---
Legend
---
OP has no idea how to make a game let alone a 2 major hit series unlike Todd.
---
Not at all. Rarity isnt about the price. Ita about recieving a low chance item and knowing it.
---
" mirelurk spawn will freakin' clap your cheeks " I see this as an absolute win!
---
I guess. I mean I’m not going to list everything off but the dude had 1000 nuke mines as well.
---
I didn't even realize Trump had siblings.
---
Ok word.
---
Yes I had FO1 and 2 on release day, I am an old hand. I just don't feel the old Black Isle vibe at all in this, it reminds me more of bioshock/borderlands. And sure, some of the basic mechanics are similar to the later FO games but that's about it. What do you think makes it like FO1 and 2?
---
The event 'One violent night' has a chance to drop all 3 jumpsuits and both masks as one reward. im level 299 and this has happened to me once and i play that event alot.
---
Hello it's me, your brother.
---
How about don’t suggest more stuff for them to paywall
---
build an collection of the best weapons/armor in the game? idk if you have all the weapons of all the top tier legendary effects like AA,TS,B,J,F etc.. in  explosive and FFR  
---
you could also collect rare clothing...rare junk items...theres so many stuff to possibly collect ...unless you not into that
---
I do :)
---
Jumpsuits? U mean like the pirate and orange ones?
---
No, that's a programming choice.  PRNGs are a mathematical construct, there is no particular programming choice about them.
---
As someone who has played the Fallout series since it launched I really don't see the comparison beyond some very basic elements. Obviously that does not make your opinion wrong ofc but I just don't see it or get the same vibe from playing it.
---
But is fallout 76 worth it
---
A subscription is infinitely different from a purchase. This is unlike any other refund they've performed before. I sincerely doubt anyone was dumb enough to think it was exploitable. If companies can agree on a single thing, it's that if you cancel subscriptions, they're cancelling the service it provides.
---
Well I enjoy both which is probably heresy to some people :) I almost got burned at the stake for saying I thought FO3 was better than FONV a few years ago lol
---
Can you go into the friends list and look under recent and see if you recognize the name?
---
Priorities 😒
---
There is a "filter" option to change what is shown if I remember correctly.
---
Those are good points too.  I forgot the mines were pretty much worthless unless you want to place one on top of another and blow it up point blank.  I also would like remote functionality (C4) without having to shoot a mine or something.
---
Sorry I came across like that I was trying to make a point. My point is all these requests and changes cost Uncle Todd some serious money. Last time I checked Bethesda is not a charity so buy 1 less coffee a week and get Fallout 1st and help Uncle Todd out. I really would hate to see Uncle Todd in line at the soup kitchen because you gold digging cheap mother f#ckers can't chip in and help Uncle Todd out.
---
Random
---
Unfortunately I think that had alluded me too. But if I do I'll let ya know.
---
I’m a hoarder lol I buy all the rare outfits and shit every chance I get.
---
&gt; If you take a Nukashine and it finishes while you’re on the mr. Fuzzy ride, that song the ride plays follows you everywhere until you get on the ride and leave again
---
Yeah, I've had that when drinking too much in real life...
---
Will do 👌🏽
---
Ok thank you
---
How?
---
derp
---
Yes, I was pretty annoyed by the Epic thing given my games are all on Steam. Not annoyed enough to not play it but I thought it was a poor move even though I appreciate why developers do it.
---
I give 3 a lot of flack for having a somewhat more nonsensical and shallow main plot compared to previous games, but you really hit the nail on the head there.   
---
3 really did do exploration amazingly well. Far better than in any previous Fallout game. The map was full of landmarks to be drawn towards, and it didn't take forever to reach them. So it avoided one of the biggest issues that games like it have. BORING EXPLORATION!!!  
---
And open world is a boring slog of garbage is there's nothing there to find. Oh yay, you designed a beautiful valley full of trees and a stream. Is there anything in there? No? Huh, guess it's nothing more than an annoying obstacle that I'll ignore and never return to after I've passed it.
---
I have the firemen's outfit,I'll shoot you a message on Xbox.
---
They can choose where they pull the seed from, be it a hash of the players name/account, cpu temp, atmospheric noise, etc.
---
No one is saying they aren't using an algorithm to process the seed data. People are pointing out they are using crap input for the algorithm. Remember GIGO.
---
This would be awesome!
---
Sure but you could then debate they said they wouldn't sell non-cosmetic items for advertisement then ignored that, now were at the point where items/features/tools in an online game where you engage with others is restricted behind a paywall so yes it's optional but it's creating a disadvantage for those that don't pay. Following that rumours of "gear" are coming only to subscribers that will again be optional to buy but still restrict and unbalance for those that decide not to optionally pay.
---
Plus I imagine some people are upset because they want to subscribe but due to how the Beth/Zenimax has handled it feel uncomfortable spending more perhaps out of principal or doubt.
---
Another shorter answer is, cutting in line isn't illegal and is optional but you'd still be a dick for doing it and it effects others behind you.
---
I hope your post is about fo1st otherwise I've just rambled for literally no reason lol.
---
Is it made with low hanging fruit?
---
Yeah, not paying for it though, playing some Outer Worlds too. Wait, you're just being a meanie, you don't care!!! :(
---
Nah it spawns the whitesprings, white powder and the BOS jumpsuits.
---
We need a scorch Brady repellent, I have logged in and have immediately been attacked in low level areas where a scorch Beast just shouldn’t be. It’s like dang, gimme 30 seconds to arm myself.
---
Not mischief night
---
I couldnt, when I logged back in after the game crashed, all the recent players were gone. My game crashed at his camp so I kept trying to hop servers to find it
---
I know a lot of people have said it here, but I want to interject and at least say this much. 
---
If you find an exploit, if you're going to report it, do not indicate you used it. Remember, it's always your coworker buying the porn at hotels. Assuming you genuinely care about the state of the game and think Beth can fix exploits or workarounds you discover, do not indicate at any point you've used it. 
---
Even if we don't have the full story, Bethesda does reserve the right to ban people who break their ToS, even if they're just providing evidence for others breaking ToS. I'm not sure why exactly this person was banned, but the fact remains, keep yourself out of exploit reports, it protects you from shite like this.
---
I have the fireman outfit :) I'll shoot ya a message on Xbox
---
Nice one
---
Don't think so. It looks empty now.
---
No, you're kidding me, they called it an HK?
---
Damn, maybe they got away with is because they were a small company in a tiny industry, but try something like that today and you'd probably get your arse sued off.
---
Bethesda is exploiting us. We have been loyal to the game ever since we bought it and we get treated like shit. I'm out as well, anyone wanna play modern warfare?
---
It will be behind the paywall and done in due time dont you worry.  Trust bethesda
---
Well when a man loves a woman, or maybe when hes been drinking too much he puts his.....you know this is really your fathers job.
---
Is it? I'm always not that update when something starts and ends.
---
Perhaps go to Bubbles (is that her name?) in Whitesprings and buy all the different Nuka Cola then treat yourself to a restaurant down the hall
---
&gt;Maybe my intention is to prevent new players from going unyielding too soon. Wait until you finish the main quest: enjoy the struggle and challenge.
---
how patronizing of you to assume everyone wants to hit bats with a peashooter. some of us like to deal actual damage.
---
not to mention you forgot the part where a sight breeze brushing you the wrong way is enough to kill you. gone are the days that sentinel/cavalier and emergency protocols would keep you alive indefinitely.
---
and you're also wrong in assuming that 15 is a particularly high special stat. the cap for sneaking is **50** agility, for example.
---
Start hiring out ballplayers to be paid mercenaries and bodyguards. Equip a small elite team of players, or a large rabble of minions and become a supervillain. Find low-level player camps and buy out their stock to give them some cash. Buy the most expensive gear you can find and hold events that offer that gear as a reward. Head into the Enclave and buy recipes and gear for the players who won't join that faction. Try to establish a currency out of non-standard items like teddybears or jarred scorched hands with your caps reserve as a backing. Pay players to rehearse and put on a theatrical production of our first days out of the vault (singing, costumes, choreography)
---
Yeah thats a bug they dont bother fixing cuz that would mean they lose out on atoms
---
Im hoping they release content for everyone  soon
---
I'm having the exact same problem except i have 3 mules filled up also lol. I already did what some proposed here and bought plans and recipes I don't intend on using but it just doesn't fell rewarding at all. So at the moment I'm just hoarding the caps in case we need some for wastelanders or they follow my suggestion and give us a slot machine or some other cap sink.
---
Problem is, when you don't need caps there is also no need to go out farm something, so there goes a good part of the "endgame".
---
It won't minecraft has completely destroyed the chance of any new game breaking that record for a long time. They literally took out tetris a game that has been out and super popular for over 30 years.
---
Oh ok
---
Only way to fix That is to move your camp and start over
---
Seeing how game company's are selling fully polished games running on there own specially made engine (witcher 3 for example) and still make a shit ton of profit I think uncle Todd made enough money by selling power Armour skins for a third of the price of a full game.
---
Thats just fucking bullshit, and I mean, if he doesn't keep the player base engaged with something that means even less money, so doing stuff like this is profitable in the long run.
---
F
---
I laugh at your salty tears - I see my post is attracting all the Survival mode dropouts.
---
Fact - Survival Mode is dead, gone, removed from the game!
---
Because I make a habit of throwing subscription money at incomplete and not fully operational products all the time.
---
With the quality of FO76, Bethesda should be happy with the initial purchase and whatever cut of Xbox live subscription cost they get. No place else is a 99.9% uptime truly acceptable. Due to server crashes I easily lose a minute or two of play time a day, and I'm not even on all the time like some are.
---
They used to be usable before the demolition nerf  i miss those grenades
---
Yeah i thought so, hardly a fix! Maybe if you can get under the water you can move it again? My water is too shallow to swim in though.
---
Ah, the Nuclear Winter kangaroo combat method lol. I actually do this sometimes when I'm swarmed, but I'd rather be able to actually block and do real melee combat. I don't play a low health build so I can tank out the damage while pumping chems and stims. Now what melee in Fallout really needs is to be able to parry.
---
I have had that happen. Now I just do my dailies before I play NW.  That way I don't miss out.
---
perhaps. but fact is that everyone is always complaining about how dead NW is.
---
Im like this too, I used to get nervous when they wanted me to use ventrilo on guild raids in EQ. Its silly to me now, this game actually helped me get over that and I talked to anyone is see. Now I play when my wife is asleep so I can't use mic and I miss that.
---
From what I've seen in building videos once you place something under the water No matter how deep it cant be moved
---
I voted for Bernie Sanders
---
Maybe, I'd check back on the hour. That's when Mischief Night ends.
---
Bastard piss.
---
And for the small cost of a coffee a week you can enjoy all the benefits of Fallout 1st and get those precious minutes back.
---
Yeah....i only use one character cause i really dont think having 60k caps is anymore usefull than 30k....
---
I spent 20 yesterday. Then turned my vendor back on and in 2 or 3 hours alreadt earned 10 back, lol
---
Yeah I did this last week trying to make a little grotto. Oh well
---
The input to a PRNG is completely irrelevant, all it does is set the initial value for the sequence.  "GIGO" doesn't apply to a PRNG, all outputs are garbage, it's just a (pseudo) random number.
---
It's interesting when you look at 3 and NV and chart the main quest locations. In 3 you essentially only really explore the SE area of the map leaving huge areas untouched, in NV you basically follow a hook shape counter clockwise until you reach NV, unless you do the valley run from the start area ofc and get past the Casadores, deathclaws and muties, which at level 1 is unlikely. 3 has lots of hidden places and things to find if you are really exploring. 
---
It was something I found dissapointing about 4, you are led by the hand too much and lots of fun things are in plain sight in main quest areas. I think a lot of people didnt go out and explore in 3 and hence there was the criticism of it being boring so in 4 the over compensated to be sure people didnt miss things.
---
NOOOO dont give them more ideas for fallout 1st
---
Buy stuff from players vendors that you know you can get more money for.  Once you’re low on caps put them in your vendor or trade them with other players.
---
That's what I'm doing, a cave near an acid deposit by any chance?
---
yeah, the map is truly awesome and so is multiplayer... I enjoyed all fallouts but 76 is my favorite by far
---
I have no great love for the first map, but my worry is once they complete a new one they will mothball the Morgantown map like they did with the original. It would add a lot if there was a rotation.
---
They all ready pay walled the nice skins on stairs and the garage door I don't think they will change it but honestly I would rather pay for these skins instead of all the other utility and pay to play bs that's all I mean it's what they promised cosmetics only
---
The few people I know with it have had server downtime issues with private servers too. They're still hosted by the same provider. Would be better if it was a model where you could run it off your own PC. Would easily "make" me build a new PC, pay for another copy of 76, and pay for First.

Personally I'd rather they do away with the weapons real designation, and give it a Fallout name - like the Handmade's clearly a Kalashnikov - and keep the 10mm ammo from FO2 so that you don't have to farm some weird ammo that nothing else uses, and then give it that sweet, sweet 50 round mag...but that's asking a lot LOL
---
You know it, brother 👉👉
---
The edge here is brittle and boring
---
Nope, I'm across from the pleasantville station.
---
Yeah, they explosive gun legendary effect should have had its damage associated with the applicable gun damage perk not tied to the explosive weapons perk.  Rocket launchers and grenade launchers suffered as well as explosives.  I think grenades can partially be fixed though by making them easier to use and more predictable to land damage.
---
&gt;**2** (two) major hit series
---
I don't think the Terminator game was that big of a hit.
---
Todd has also obviously ditched Fo76 a long, long time ago. he's probably working on TES now, or starfied. someone else is behind this mess of a mode.
---
Thank you very much for this guide, it will be very useful for my next ammo run.
---
As an ardent Fallout fan, I don't want that to be the lesson...but it was, and it will be. I'm treating this like an old house I used to live in. I have great memories, but when I went back to it, I find that it doesn't resemble what I remember. It's better to stay away and keep the memories than to ruin it by going back.
---
The boys have Xbox Gamepass now, and both are loving Outer Worlds and other "free" games. Works for me...
---
You are in denial
---
oh its certainly fun I wont disagree with you on that and the dialogue is a nice return to earlier days where choices have consequences. That was something I felt was lacking in 4, even though I like 4 and play it a lot.
---
I love this idea. The only reason I do quests or play NW is to get collectible items, primarily apparel or camp items. It’s nice when there are rewards for loyal players who are crappy players. I just like to wander around and look for things while listening to good music and occasionally slaughtering a thing or two. That ends with me scrounging for caps and hoping I can find items to buy when I can’t finish quests like Project Paradise, etc.
---
WoW's customer support is in the states. They are the people you call for issues like bugs or anything, and if they can't fix it they can directly escalate you to someone who can.
---
It's the realist build to be honest, kill fast die fast, I can stealth through west tek and actually feel like a commando knifing super mutes but if I mess up I'm swarmed and die.
---
On the flip side I've seen builds based on survivability wading in an ocean of glowing radherpes spreading ghouls slowly beating them down with a flamer, the PA mod that reflects damage, and the mutation that releases low damage aoes add some autostim, radsponge and some mysterious stranger to it and they look like unbalanced gods
---
Won't ever happen.
---
I've gotten unlucky multiple times then... it's a nightmare as a solo, and as a team most of our time was spent stimpakking each other lol.
---
And Lode Baring is pretty damn great, honestly. And the more folks show up, the better it is!
---
The drop isn't level locked - all of the players I've met who have had it received it after level 100, including myself. It's a very difficult drop to find, and took me over 900 hours of playing (it dropped during Fertile Soil for me). You can also buy one on the trading forums for about 15k caps if the drop rates aren't in your favour
---
Dang, well, good to know anyway! Thanks!
---
Being unable to target limbs with melees while in VATS, even with the concentrated fire perk, is a big let-down for me (although you can still target limbs with your fists, at least after a ranged weapon breaks). VATS is still pretty effective with melees if you know the ins-and-outs of it.
---
According to the game files while using xEdit, melee mods that have a chance of crippling a limb have a chance of 50%, which is a significant value. I'm not too sure about the legendary effect though.
---
Jumping backwards with marsupial makes sure you're out of your target's reach but VATS almost guarantees a hit from a considerable distance.
---
You can also power attack outside of VATS and then quickly use VATS before landing a hit to land a critical power attack while sneaking, but, like you said, it requires constant switching from VATS to land consistent sneak power attack criticals.
---
As for the melee mechanics themselves, I actually think they are more responsive than Skyrim's.
---
2 notable things are the dedicated power attack key, rather than having to hold the attack key/button to power attack, and being able to move while power attacking, rather than being locked in place until the animation ends.
---
The timing based block was hard to get used to as someone coming from playing Skyrim to their first Fallout game, but I think its ability to completely block melee attacks when timed correctly is a nice trade-off compared to only blocking some of the melee damage like in Skyrim.
---
I really need to transfer my inventory from my melee character to my optimized mule, writing this makes me want to go back to using my melee character even more.
---
I'd noticed it triggering more as well, it's like they heard me writing "I never see this hurr durr" and fixed it.
---
A shame they removed cap rewards from the UI, because then I might've noticed that. That's a crazy amount compared to basically everything else!
---
I like you. You say things I think but don't feel like posting. I'm giving you random silverware
---
Did you even stop for a moment to read the slanderous lies and half truths you are spreading about Uncle Todd's game not being fully polished.
---
I can 100% tell you my Fo76 Disc is so polished I can see my reflection in it.
---
Play Time should be working now, just go to Berkeley Springs and chat with the Miss Nanny wandering around.
---
Im used to research in such games cause of Elder Scrolls online. I screwed up my first character so hard i had to delete it. I couldnt do questing alone. That was a lesson.
---
The guy was a known bug reporter, it was something he did often. Bethesda will literally ask you to try to replicate a bug before you report it. So he was literally just following the information he was given to him by bethesda.
---
All of this is true.
---
idkkk man you might just be making up excuses for you losing
---
Sheepsquatch did a little bit, but I would be nice to hve more of that type of content. No word on the other vaults yet that I have seen.
---
1 outfit and 2 hats ...... I completed the event a lot of times and i got the costume just yesterday!!!
---
Good to know on Uranium Fever, I guess I'll keep at it!
---
While I will struggle to respond to such a well-formulated comment, I played Gears 5 start to finish without a hiccup, so for me it was flawless. One time I had to start the game twice because it failed to launch in a timely fashion, so that's why I equivocated with "nearly"...as I don't know if that was the fault of the game or console.
---
Not sure how funny that is, but you be you.
---
That's just me reading your mind.
---
Not yet, just old enough to enter the working world, though, so here's hoping.
---
Oh yes.. I have done that one once since it was fixed.... that’s how memorable it was! Ha!
---
hahahahaha yesssss, making meaningful change in the wasteland
---
And to be fair to the Ash Heap, I'm still working to correct my under-sampling of them. Even with a modestly low drop rate like 10% it'd be totally reasonable for me to have missed the plans. Such is the hardship of sample sizes.
---
You're welcome! And I'm definitely still at it.
---
These "People" sound like gold digging b#tch ass trolls that don't want to contribute to a better Wasteland.
---
It depends on how lagged your game is versus theirs. In their game, it might actually appear as a legendary where in yours it hasn't yet completed its spawn-in. It's the same reason when you don't tag it, you won't get any loot. The loot given is based on each game client. Yes, if it's killed too rapidly, for some people they might not even get shot in. That's really the more pressing problem. Not waiting for it to become a legendary is a view you might only see, not the person shooting it. Yes, it's a game network synchronization problem, but that's what happens when a game developer attempts to redesign a game engine for network multiplayer when it wasn't designed for that purpose.
---
Ah, I see you are one of the people who do not not the real quote. Its ok. People think it is a sweeping statement made from Todd that all their products simply work all the time. Never was. It was a quote about a specific new function that was added to Fallout 4.
---
And it did work, it really did.
---
Oh I had fun, learning how to make effective/efficient spreadsheets in Google Sheets has been a nice learning experience.
---
lol thanks
---
noob winter shouldn't exist 
---
fallout has to keep its honour, we need vaults, radiated monsters, npcs, locations, quests, factions...
---
Yes, I played both. Actually I’m kinda playing TOW, FO4 and 76 together. TOW is a totally different game actually more like RPG Metro Exodus instead of Fallout. Which is now a open world sandbox rpg.
---
Pattern recognition skills function in different ways for different people, some people see similarities where others cannot recognize and others can draw conclusions to fill in missing gaps of information
---
The teachers?
---
Damn good actually. KOTR 2 is the better game and I'd really recommend it if you'd like to play an enjoyable and really well made Star Wars RPG.
---
I would pay 15K caps as that would be a deal. One sold 2 days ago for 20K caps + 50K 556. There were multiple other offers of 20-30K caps and/or 556.
---
Thank you for the info on levels and the event you completed to get the reward! Confirming that this is not level locked was my main goal. Hearing the various events/dailies is a bonus as it confirms the reward is available throughout the Forest Region.
---
Tea Time just has problems with the wave spawning, imho... even with three people I've seen it get hectic and fun when all three locations get mobbed. And then there's the "five people sit in silence for four minutes" version.
---
For other great team events, definitely do Lode Baring, Guided Meditation and Project Paradise, they are amazing with people.
---
there are shitload of items in this game, rarity / legendary tags would be a good idea
---
So, the people I know that are actually paying for first are the same bitch ass gold digging trolls that don't want to pay for it? Make up your fucking mind. Holy shit.
---
The stupidity on the internet is astounding(and this is said as someone who has contributed largely to said stupidity over the last 20 years)
---
I'm currently re-building at that very same spot! I had some flamingos stuck under water too.
---
For the Christmas event. Oh guess it too late, maybe next year.
---
They almost certainly will do.  These days arms companies have realised that they can get games studios to pay them for a license to use the name of their guns.
---
Usually studios can get away with using things that "look like" real guns if they don't use the real name.
---
If their was a P90 based weapon it should really use 5mm, that's the caliber closest to the real P90, but in Bethesda's world where a combat rifle is chambered in .45 who knows?
---
&gt; like the Handmade's clearly a Kalashnikov 
---
Do you know the story of why it's called a handmade?  Because it's literally based on a copy of a Kalashnikov that someone made by hand, down to the idea of using a shovel as the stock.
---
Behold the wonder of the shit-shovel Kalashnikov:

And so, we come down to the last Mischief Night in about 30 minutes. Let's all get one last run in before it disappears until next year.
---
holy shit how have I not done patrol duty since back when it was the only way to get handmade plans... okay, wow
---
I knew about the guaranteed weapon plan, but thanks! I honestly can't believe I forgot about this, I'm embarrassed now. &gt;_&gt;
---
Yes within the last month or two.
---
Nice! Well, I'll keep hunting.
---
Great, now go help that fat woman into those 6" high heels
---
oh my.. there are people this dumb.
---
Awesome, thank you for the confirmation on that one! It's another one where I'm always so excited to get them that I insta-learn them.
---
Go back to farming carrots, and leave NW to the real players. It's ok.
---
Have you tried bolstering? I've always been a power armor user, so I haven't really tried either unyielding or bolstering.
---
Also, how do you manage nuke zones?
---
Every time its ghouls for me and i dis it solo at lvl 30 with no op build. So yeah you got really unlucky or i got really lucky. But i will definitely be doing lode baring. Cause although i probably used all my luck on the responder fireman uniform from the flatwoods quests i still want to try for the plasma grenade plan.
---
Yep, I had this confirmed to me by other folks and by my own work last night... wow. You'd think they would've mentioned that in the patch notes, or fixed the UI so it was indicated in any way after event completion. &gt;\_&gt;
---
I had two and scrapped them. Not a fan.
---
Bro. It's a damn joke that means Bethesda will never do it
---
I love playing melee in Fallout, especially 76, it's fun to just run right into the thick of battle and tank it out, in particular when you have a number of other players who draw the enemies attention away with their ranged weapons. But sometimes when I play other games that have really honed melee combat systems, it makes me wish that they'd put that kind of care into a Fallout games combat. It's miles better than it was in 3, where you basically had to use vats because it wasn't viable otherwise, but there's a lot of room for improvement.
---
I was looking for this comment :)
---
You can see Todds reflection as well if you keep staring into your own eyes.
---
I'm also on pc since the beginning of nw. And I see alot of veterans from nw just stop playing, less and less familiar faces around and more and more new cheaters. It's so sad. This one of the reasons why I wrote this post, I'm trying to contribute somehow amd make more people talking and shearing their experiences. I really want to play nw as it was at the beginning, when we was enjoying and everyone had the same chance of winning the mutch, even without any weapon because npcs killed the last guy. Those games long gone now sadly. I hope Bethesda will do something soon. And i see alot of players just stay afk at the spawn, because they still trying to complete the challenges and get the unlockables. This is very sad...
---
To be fair, sometimes it's just "pick 5 flowers", which I already had in my inventory so I can immediately turn it in. But that Miss Nanny herself is pretty memorable imho
---
What system do you play on? I got an extra white spring jumpsuit. Looking for the pirate outfit or the long pants jack o lantern suit.
---
No.
---
How do you know that those "People" are not trolling you by telling lies about Fallout 1st.
---
Nope. This is just 1 game. If Starfield and ES6 both bomb then I will, but you gotta look at everything that came before Fo76 too. They were amazing
---
We have the best bugs, greatest bugs. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it.
---
Because I was on their private server when it crashed. Nice try, trollman(or woman)
---
Sorry for your loss! I may have had one at one point as I recall having a broken helmet I could not repair - this meant I could not wear it either so I sold or scrapped it. That was MANY months ago and I would not have known its rarity when I did (if it was indeed the rare one).
---
Another idiot who can't read did they stop teaching that, lol.
---
Oh but they will. Probably be a fallout 1st exclusive item.
---
I don't see why people compare Mcdonalds to Burger King.
---
Seriously, the two fast foods chains are vastly different and while McDonalds has the Big Mac and Burger King has the Whopper, is it really like McDonalds (or any Micky D's burger) beyond a few basic similarities. I keep seeing people saying it's like a Whopper with less beef and dehydrated onions but honestly, I really don't see it myself. It's more like Wendy's Dave Double mixed with a Carl's Junior big burger than it is McDonalds. 
---
Do these folks comparing McDonalds with Burger King etc... have a fair point or is this just more jumping on the "lets hate McDonalds" bandwagon?
---
I think you can still go back to New Vegas 1 and 2 and have a great experience, because those still are great games, but yeah, it's impossible to even defend F76 and Bethesda in general, it's also a shame that there are not that many coop games in the market like it so people end up flocking to it because of the franchise and world lore.
---
I would say that Destiny, Bordelands and even Dark Souls 3 are some decent coop games with some interesting worlds and some persistency, specially the first 2, crazy that i'm recommending Destiny after all these years over another game, but hey, it's free and it has loot, also it's not buggy as hell.
---
NV was an example of how to solve the linear storyline issue in an open world game. The issue with an open world is how to put an actually engaging linear storyline into that design. So via strategically leveling certain areas higher and lower, they encouraged them to follow a specific route and to encounter certain locations and NPCs in a preferred order. 
---
My issue with 4 was that while you are given a fantastic amount of encouragement via quests and locations to explore in the northern and central (ie Boston) areas of the map, they kinda dropped the ball on the southern 3rd of the map. 
---
That whole area between the Marina and Jamaica Plain is just...meh. And the areas around the SE part of the map, while interesting in some ways, feel a bit lighter in content and engagement. And the Glowing Sea, while cool in concept and implementation, is just kinda...empty. Like there should be more there.
---
Just noticed the Brotherhood flair it's  just like the Brotherhood of Steel to keep taking and give nothing back. Raiders have a higher standard then the BOS douche bags.
---
What bug is it? Sucks that I missed all the easy weekly ones too 🤬
---
Imagine that I'm not speaking literally, and you'll get what I mean.
---
Goooooood idea. Noted, and will do the same
---
I hope not. I’ve done spent all my atoms. Haha. Lots of good daily and weekly challenges today though so I’ll have more shortly.
---
That would be dope, little towns and cities from around wv. Charleston charles town martinsburg shepherdstown etc etc
---
Look, I had a lot of fun with the game. I really did. What is really getting to me though, is that for an RPG, I felt no connection with my character at all. The only times i actually saw her were when I'd set the controller down for 5 mins and let the free camera take over. No voice, no animations (in game or cinematic) and no big "wow" moment torward the end to solidify my confidence in my character's choices. Even at the end, the back shot of my character was generic and she had a helmet on!! Something I never made visible.  And by generic, I mean that she wasnt my character... she was just a female body facing away from the shot.
---
I dunno... this turned into a rant. Sorry about that. But does anyone else feel this way?
---
I think you missed the point. The game is really easy for most builds, but bloodied might be too much. You talk about 'actual damage' but bloodied unyielding goes beyond that. Onepunching a scorchbeast is just silly. 
---
Also... I did not include food, drugs and mutations. I was talking bloodied and unyielding. It's not about peashooting, but balance. I enjoy balance. I guess you are the kind of guy who only used the Suzuki Escudo while playing Gran Turismo.
---
You clearly don't know Bethesda that well. When we ask for somethinf, they never want to give it to us
---
You are a smart person. Have a silver.
---
I feel like Beth is trying to distance its self from NV as much as possible. We don't really see anything that was unique to that game in FO4 or 76.
---
Why pay for something im not going to use? I pay for atoms when I see something I really want. It's not my fault that(when I checked) there was no flair for the Zetans.
---
It really is absurd. With no chems or other consumable boosts or Adrenal kicking in, I can hit for 4K damage with a bloodied power fist when I get my health down around 10%. 10K is easily within reach with a couple of chems and food items. My bloodied gat hits for 800-1K per shot, and with VATS, I get the range of a good rifle without giving up fire rate. I'm even seeing roughly 1K dps on the queen with a bloodied UGL, which can make short work of her.
---
The downside, of course, is that a mirelurk king can wink at me from across the map and I drop like a WS bot at shift change.
---
Just randomly, was in the area for turning in DNA daily and it automatically started when I exited VTU.
---
they already got it working, dont know why they shouldnt apply this to shelves, good idea
---
But you don't die that fast. I am not getting killed More often than with my instigating rifleman.
---
Neon green that's the Xbox color. Oh well.
---
How much is a fasnatch mask worth? I have one even though i was sure i actually missed the event
---
A whole minute or two!? Omg, you’re right, if Bethesda isn’t willing to give you those minutes back, they should demonetize all their 76 assets.
---
Right. NV is not a Bethesda product.
---
I am. and you're the kind of guy who ruins the fun for other people. they've "balanced" this game enough. there's hardly any need for even more nerfs.
---
Power attacks are more like the critical hits in vats. They both do more damage than a regular hit, though I think critical hits do more damage overall. The difference is you have to fill the meter to do crits, where as power attacks just take more AP per swing and take a lot longer to hit. Both have their uses and if you can be quick enough canceling vats after a crit and have the ap, you can go right into a power attack after landing a crit. You can also just hammer away at power attacks, but you'll burn through ap and you can often do more dps with regular hits on a faster swing rate weapon than you would doing the slow power attacks over and over and then waiting for ap to come back.
---
It can randomly stop triggering.  Havent had it pop for about 2 weeks now.
---
Not mischief night, nuclear winter
---
I'm in a similar spot (still need to buy serums recipes, but have no reason to).  What I've been doing is stockpiling ammo.  20K rounds (assuming you have space for them) will eat up a lot of your caps and keep you firing for a long time.
---
Awesome - thanks again!
---
So you actually have nothing to say other than "wait and see what happens"? LOL
---
If I recall correctly, one of the Inside the Vault articles some time ago announced that it has been delayed to Q1 2020. I guess the plan is to introduce the new system with the launch of Wastelanders, as well as a major balance pass or "normalization" of the existing character progression system that was mentioned at QuakeCon.
---
An average player should be able to get around 1,000 xp per hour
---
I felt disappointed in the ending also but the game was great. As far as connection to your character if you want to roleplay I think a silent protagonist is best, as Fallout 4's choice to have your character talk limited you to one voice (male or female) and thus few options to roleplay , compared to past Bethesda RPGs. I hated that about Fallout 4. For me I miss third person option and I think the immersion in outer worlds lack a bit because NPC's have no schedule, never go to sleep, never go somewhere else but short routes or because of quest changes. Why have a sleep option to get up in the middle of the night and characters are all still wide awake doing the same they do all day, that's what broke the immersion for me.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah, I'm done having this conversation. It is obvious you've got a bad case of dunning kruger going on.
---
This deserves its own post imho
---
As people with private servers are also able to set down their camps in Adventure mode, do you think with increased build budgets for 1st subscribers would come the stipulation that they cannot load their larger camps on the shared servers? I know a lot of 1st players who spend the majority of their time in Adventure. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.
---
Actually I was nearly homeless my entire childhood. Then I actaully was homeless at 18.
---
Nuke zones are difficult for a bloodied build to manage.  Not impossible, but certainly challenging.  If I'm in a nuke zone I'm probably on a team sharing RadSponge so I'll be at or near full health all the time.  This is where I need a different strategy - one that isn't optimum for my bloodied build, but gets me by.  Everything comes at a cost eventually.
---
I've also found running a silo is dangerous as a bloodied build.  If I die I have to start back at the begining.  Some things are just more efficient at full health.
---
I must've done the event 50+ times. Never crashed.  Try lowering your graphics
---
Asked for fridges they charged for them
---
Asked for private worlds they charged for them. 
---
Asked for modding probably going to behind that private server paywall.
---
 They deliver for a price
---
Yeah that fair. I’ll have to buy 556 and 45 like crazy.
---
What platform?
---
That's mostly the poison effect, which can be mitigated with a piece of 25% poison resist armor.
---
Yep. :(
---
the outer trash is not worth the time.
---
1st true thing you said I searched for Uncle Todd's picture and put it in front of the mirror and I could see Uncle Todd's reflection in my eyes. The strange thing is I swear Uncle Todd whispered I've built Fallout 1st they will come.
---
Oh oops, PC
---
&gt; Not waiting for it to become a legendary is a view you might only see, not the person shooting it. 
---
In the cases where it was killed so quickly that it didn't finish becoming a legendary, those that got credit for the kill confirmed they also got it as a regular spawn, not a legendary, despite seeing the name change just before it died. 
---
Whatever the reason I wanted to let people know that yes, killing a legendary enemy quickly when it initially spawns can still stop it from dying as a legendary and dropping legendary loot.

I played Dot Hack which is an RPG style game with turn based action. It was rich and complex with all these amazing weapons and armour offering a combination of defense, attacks and powers. I recall setting up a spreadsheet in Excel for that game. It was waaaaaaay back in 2002 so I think I must have done some training and was eager to put it to some use.
---
Between 300-2000c.
---
Sorry, i'm on PS4
---
I'm more concerned that there may be more than one writer.
---
No worries. o/
---
I don't have the numbers to prove it, but I've suspected that Unyielding trumps Bolstering mainly because it gives you additional AP, which in addition to being useful for just about everything, also gives the Dodgy perk additional opportunities to proc.  Dodgy blunts a significant percentage of incoming damage as long as you have the AP to cover it.
---
As far as nuke zones go, you can survive in them, but you either need to go PA (and lose Unarmed melee, Serendipity, and Unyielding, parts of which can be recovered with the Emergency Protocols torso mod) or use a Hazmat suit (and lose Unyielding's benefits).  If you go with the latter, you can use the perk card-based DR/ER boosts like Barbarian, Evasive, and Ironclad to get some protection.

---
I was able to get everything but the empty pumpkin rack plan and the pirate hat. I bought the pirate hat from a train station vendor yesterday for a little over 200 caps. My character is pretty lucky in these events, but that's probably because my real life luck is so crappy lmao.
---
I'm interested
---
You are squishy, but you aren't *that* squishy.  The causes of death are pretty straightforward to predict.  A swarm of Mirelurk Kings is no joke.  A minigun-toting Super Mutant will deplete Dodgy very quickly, and multiples of them can be a real problem.  And then there's the Colonel Gutsy swarm a la AWOL Armaments.
---
Of course, these pose a challenge to pretty much any build.
---
The one thing you're going to have objective problems with, being Bloodied, is holding the Pylons at Encryptid.

They were the only ones with this issue. Didn’t they trace it back to a Gamestop warehouse or something?

I would suggest that if it's constantly happening then just move. I'm my opinion it's not worth the hassle, or dedicating so much of your camp budget on defenses and repairs. Especially if you run vendors and they are frequently offline because of it. I had the same problem (it was only 1 scorchbeast and a persistent pack of supermutants, but I was low level and it got real old), so I packed up and moved to somewhere less anxiety inducing!
---
And they can help themselves all they want...I’m cool with that.
---
U have pirate suit
---
mmog fails warned about this a week ago. it's only gonna get worse from here.
---
funny how quick people are to defend p2w as "not really that big of a deal" when even Bethesda themselves, allegedly, see these features as p2w.
---
So, if I understand you correctly, you would say that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges?
---
My first thought was Monty Python's Holy Grail and the Camelot scene.
---
"We're dwellers of the Vault, and we dance to a fault; we role-play some scenes and kill a few things..."
---
I agree
---
That's what I thought but it doesn't seem to help. I'm assuming it's bugged somehow, but I haven't found another limb piece I like that also has the poison resist effect to switch out. It's barely a downside, anyway. Dying is of such little consequence, except when you time it just right and miss the stable flux rewards after a queen fight.
---
Got 6 Jack O'Lantern suites, 2 Fireman outfitsand 3 Whitespring jumpsuits. No pirate or short suite after 60-70 runs.
---
I had it pop up once randomly a couple months ago but that’s the only time I’ve seen it since 2018.
---
It seems to have the same problem that queen of the hunt had. It just never triggers after the first time. I totally forgot that it existed.
---
I think the problem with all that is having bases that can be moved around.  I don't think BGS can pull it off any better than they are.
---
Whenever I get a hankerin' for building I usually just go back to FO4.
---
If indeed this is the case then clearly he shouldn't have been banned at the least reinstated. But...if he being a "known" bug reporter is more 'unofficial' than 'official' especially from Bethesda's perspective then, as I mentioned, getting banned for shadowing cheaters is a risk the OP was taking. Getting caught in the mix up with bad company is unfortunate and I hope it clears up.
---
I'll buy it from ya im on ps4   psn: BAG-O-PAPER
---
I think the main reason they are compared is the same company was involved in New Vegas.
---
LOL- thats hilarious. Gonna steal that for the future
---
"On second thought let's not go to Vault 76. 'Tis a silly place."
---
Pay for skins with your free atoms?  How dare they!
---
Really really sparse :(
---
So you thought with the sub you'd get ALL Atom Shop items? 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHAHAHA     
---
*deep breath*   
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
he had 30k when they met, and how he's got nothing because of this shit every month!
---
I know, if they only gave you free atoms to...oh, wait.
---
lmao actually good one
---
Well they did add in the Ranger outfit. Although behind 1st subs. Meh.
---
Bethesda: Let us tell you about 'Fallout 1st: Prime'...
---
I lost a smoke machine that way. Only way I found was to move the camp and start again.
---
Yeah,same.  Although it stresses me out, doing mischief night with other random players has helped a bit. Before that 8 out of 10 encounters(usually high level) wanted to shoot or whack me lol. I still run away from other players on my own tho. :( in rl my anxiety isn’t THAT bad,it’s weird.
---
You are totally missing the point.  
---
 'HAHAHAHAHAHAHA' ....
---
Sorry I don't ;;
---
Nope, which is why it's great
---
INSANELY OUTRAGEOUS
---
My guy was pretty much shouting into the mic.  Seemed like he was having a bad day.  Even worse when he got me for a team mate, cause I blow, heh.
---
Just play New Vegas.... problem solved. Private server:check
---
Mods:check
---
No stupid fucking transactions that should’ve been implemented in the game in the first place:check
---
Yep,  all of the skins say the same thing "exclusive" to F1 members.  Where the "types" say comes with F1 sub.  So expect probably a type, elite\\advanced to come out each month.  And the skins for the type to come out inbetween. I bet we see desert next week.
---
Idk all i know is i read something about gamestop nuka cola themed helmets
---
how does that amuse you? (legit question)
---
lol
---
I pop some Radaways to get my health up higher than usual and a diluted Rad-X so it stays that way a little longer. Whereas I typically keep my max health around 25% just for running around, inside a nuke zone I'll get it up to 50% and let it fall down into the teens before Radaway-ing myself back up to about half again. That way I don't lose all the bloodied benefits, but I'm not hovering at the precipice of disaster either.
---
There was a small hotfix a few days ago that went under the radar. It seeminly only applied to Nuclear Winter, because I was playing in Adventure Mode fine without having to install it (I don't normally keep the Beth Launcher running).
---
Updating was all it took.
---
Also, I use mods and custom .ini files. It's as easy as making a backup of those .ini files and deleting the originals out of the game folder to play NW.
---
as far as i remember u can't play online with cfw and you get banned pretty quickly
---
Have you bought the monthly Bethesda Support terminal DLC from the creation club?
---
That is weird, I am checking my notes, and maybe I forgot to write it down somewhere, but I don't have anything in there about owing you sh!t. Maintaining a server takes time and cost money. Bandwidth, which map76 used a lot of, cost money. If you want to pay the hosting fees and pay me to maintain it, I will happily take your money. Otherwise, sit the f#ck down. No one owes you sh!t.
---
Kind of disappointing when I’m most excited for the grill and the barbed wire tire sales
---
Y'know, I was wondering why was the Ranger outfit showing up in the Armor Workbench as a customizable item.
---
Great. Now it's gonna end up in atomic shop priced at 500 caps.
---
Last time I bought atoms I got a private server bundled in and some other goodies!
---
I doubt it. There's a *ton* of Atom Shop material in the game files that dataminers have found, that hasn't been made live yet. At least a few weeks worth of material if they wanted to bring it out.
---
New server each reset as far as I’m aware
---
Sure you were I bet you still believe the Earth is Flat. Stop being cheap and think of Uncle Todd's 401k.
---
I don't farm carrots, either.
---
I'd love it you had a choice in workshops of a few different modes, including the "ever increasing waves of attackers" -- so start with it like now, then the next one is 2x, and so forth.
---
Nah it's just a glitch. I get that message now and then and I just quit to desktop and log back in.
---
stop asking for anything, they just monetize all our requests.
---
Sell thats what this dumpsterfire is all about. grinding several hours per week in order to get 2.50 and be happy that you can almost "buy" the re-used Fallout 4 asset for 15 bucks.
---
you have about 5 minutes and then a new server
---
It will sound like heresy to some, but big portions of what made FNV great were there thanks to Bethesda. Obsidian shouldn't take all thr credit for FNV, since TOW shows that Obsidian are good ONLY at writing, nothing else....
---
Paywall to have access to a paywall
---
Yeah, 42 years of experience programming versus a few misunderstood keywords.  It's pretty clear *somebody* is suffering from the Dunning Kruger effect.
---
In a way I understand why they rotate items to keep things fresh by imo I think that it is just stupid and that it is better just to have a large inventory of products than a small select few that rotates in and out every week or so.
---
They aren't servers, they are worlds, and they aren't exactly private either. Think of it as a separate instance, that anyone on your friends list can join even if you don't want them to.
---
sames- silver lining on that one.
---
They added the ranger outfit less then two weeks ago.
---
you're only getting a gauss pistol, maybe, and you'll like it.
---
There is currently no permanence.
---
Loot respawns
---
it does reset eventually but if you go to main menu and rejoin the world immeadiately it'll be the same server
---
I got one last week from Bots on Parade in the ash heap, think I was about level 198 at the time.
---
You may want to check my post history, I worked on GW2 as a game dev. You're welcome to try again though.
---
Oh well shit...yes...
---
Prenium items *should* be free for all
---
One thing to keep in mind is that loot is tied to your character, not the server. 
---
In other words, you can't run through some place and pick up everything, log off for 20 minutes, then jump in and try to re-loot the same place.  There's a cool down tied to your character on loot spawning. 
---
That said, if you exit and jump right back in, it's the same world.
---
Sounds fun until you see it implemented in FO76. Then you realize that trying to play it with 12 fps and 200 ping is not as fun as you thought.
---
That’s just being a dick in my opinion, it’s their money let them spend it on whatever they want. I actually met a fallout 1ste player yesterday he was pretty nice and gave me combat shotgun.
---
I’m not surprised 12 bucks for the exclusive right to spend five bucks. Not unexpected but i was more hoping the exclusives would be part of the deal.
---
Only issue is anyone that sends you a friend request can join your special little world.
---
To be honest I’m most excited for the sale on barbed wire tires and the BBQ cooking set, whether that says something about the state of the store/game is another thread entirely
---
I'm gen x, you're a fucking whiny baby. Go cry about how hard it is for your loser ass to get $100 lmao
---
I don't think it's that much of an issue. If you want a base that's more ingrained within the world space I've found plenty of buildings that aren't marked as locations, so you can place a camp there and build similar to fallout 4.
---
They just want those 1650 atoms you get for from the fallout 1st subscription back
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Why were you dying at all with a full hp build? Other than being repeatedly staggered if you die with a full hp build you're doing something wrong.
---
I have a feeling we might get this. I prefer a 50/50 chance at getting either map but the weekly cycle is fine too.
---
Actually when they announced "items display" I thought you will be able to fill your shelfs but instead those shitty vitrines came.
---
Rather disappointing. But sadly that's the case with most of their updates
---
Cool, I'll have to take a look!  I haven't ever seen a popup so I assumed nothing was happening.
---
I'm envisioning something more like the hyperactive squirrel.
---
Sure
---
It's tied to your character.  If you loot something within the threshold (some say it's based on the time since you last looted it, others say its based on number of subsequent looted things, perhaps both), that threshold continues to apply whether you go to a public or private server.  You cannot just start new private servers to loot an endless number of things.
---
Lol, spot on.
---
Im all for the ability to make a sun room! They just need new walls in general. And to make it where you can put the wallpaper on either side without glitching it...
---
Its not so much a bandwagon as a timetabled regular service between bethesda and 'wtf have they done now'.
---
76 could have been so good, but at every turn they have shot themselves in the foot.
---
then i look at outer worlds, yes it was shorter than a fallout, by a fair bit, but, it was enjoyable all the way through, not once did it bug out and kill my progress or break a fundamental game system, unlike fallout.
---
Expecting people to look the part is absolutely essential. 
---
I am cool with people dressing down in their off hours and during costume events as part of the roleplay but people absolutely need to be in uniform and look the part during the RP of BoS duties.
---
It sounds like your group has the same policy as all the others I have seen, which doesn't really go far enough.
---
Ok, short pant suit for pirate costume then?
---
IGN: Jinxy+Zilla
---
deserved by anyone who actually paid for this bullshit
---
Yeah it was a bit disappointing for sure. I like the idea of display cases but I felt they should be a subsection of item display rather than the main feature.
---
The lack of content is a joke complaint. It's basically "lack of the one type of content I like" to make their favorite game look better in comparison. From what I saw TOW is lacking in tons of areas so you're completely right. If we start playing the "lack of content" card, then TOW would be victim of it as well. Any argument  for and against this statement can be applied to both games equally...
---
Nice! I admit, I took screenshots of bomb locations in the Galleria for just that occasion.
---
I have been dreaming with something like this.
---
In FO4 you could set up trap cages and that would eventually trigger attacks on your settlements by similar enemies of the ones in the cages and that was something I loved doing just equipping my settlers with nice weapons and armor and putting some defenses and watching how they defend the base.
---
I want something similar (not with NPC but with people, like mentioned here to fight against zombies waves)
---
Who needs friends when I have dancing emotes? :)
---
There's fair degree of similarities. They are both games of same genre. Perhaps biggest difference is the open large world vs. semi-open smaller one. It's better to compare these two, than either one to ice hockey/racing/any other completely unrelated game of different genre.
---
Very valid comparisons could be made with things that both games have in common, about which one gets it better.
---
Can't really say a lot of things Fallout 4/76 does better, and the online aspect/farming/loot system of F76 can't be really compared to limited single player game. Some things are neither better or worse. Vats or TTD, both are very fine at their task and each could be swapped to either with very little adjustments. UI in general is so much better on The Outer Worlds. Bethesda takes a decade for baby steps(we're talking things like your char sitting to a chair because you wanted to pick a damn plastic on the table next to the chair was on) The party mechanic and specially party inventory is simply so much ahead in TOW. It serves no purpose that party members have their own inventory to manage. 
---
Oh, TOWs party member AI doesn't exactly impress. They charge the enemy at whiff of combat, and die. Guess who's playing on supernova. Yeah hard yoloing to die is pretty horrible, that is so much better in Fallouts.
---
&gt;I keep seeing people saying its New Vegas in space but honestly, I really don't see it myself.
---
Yeah there's not a lot of strong similiarities. People mostly would say that because of Obsidian. Perhaps most similiar aspects of these two, is dialog and it's humour. There's some very similiarities, but totally trivial like the camera pan(zoom?) when you kill the last enemy. It's semi annoying at times when you kill some weak singular critters off. But that feature could be there or could be not, it hardly defines the game or makes them similiar.
---
&gt;have a fair point or is this just more jumping on the "lets hate Bethesda" bandwagon?
---
Depends exactly on what they are saying. Stuff like "The Outer worlds is better." belongs to chat. Sadly Reddit&amp;Redditors is quite at that, even allowing making posts with only a title. But elaborate comparions on different aspects can be made. For anyone considering, I would highly recommend playing TOW. For me it's not going to prevent me eventually reaching 2k hours on F76. Just know it's a fairly short game.
---
I mean... didn’t we know this 2 weeks ago? Lol
---
I've only played 3 characters enough to really judge and I die and kill easier on my bloodied, the first was a messy power armor heavy weapons guy outside or learning the game I really didnt die much. The other was a tanky vanguard armored guy soon as the backpacks dropped with the armor mods, he wasnt god mode but was pretty survivable. And then there was the bloodied/unyielding melee guy I try to keep my health at the nerdrage threshold but end game groups waste me time and time again unless I play slow or play in a group where they're distracting most of them...I didnt have to worry to much about rads, poison, or groups until this guy
---
But Fallout has evolved. Fallout 3 redefined what it means to be Fallout. And by that standards TOW is quite far from a Fallout game...
---
LOL
---
You on PC? I can build you one.
---
I feel your pain. I launched my first nuke at white spring on Saturday (PS4 Pro) and blue screened immediately trying to hit the first ghoul.
---
Good times !
---
It catches me out at least once a month if not more.
---
Never before have i been punished by the game for actually playing the game.
---
Possible. It's also possible it will bring in enough revenue to better fund the main game instead of pushing pay to win content.
---
I got loads of pumpkin plans, must have done the event over 40 times. But about 3-4 times each day it would lag, then freeze, crash, kick me out. So often I didn’t get any rewards. I only just got the short pantsuit on my penultimate attempt, didn’t get any pirate stuff. I probably got only about half the list, I did get a lot of repeat plans.
---
Hmm interesting cause I see it as $8.33 a month for about twice the amount of atoms than I'm spending, plus all the other perks like private servers, unlimited scrap, etc.
---
All about the perspective I suppose.
---
AA is better than two shot. Stick with that. Two shot adds recoil and overall makes your gun less accurate. It’s only good on explosive launchers since they still do nearly double damage unlike regular guns
---
That's what workshop defence should be, instead of 5 waves of 3 radrats.
---
I miss it but it never made sense to get rid of it or nuke nerf every pvp build due to farmers and scavengers trying to pvp than crying when their gear and special doesn’t work. I still run a bloodied explosive build and it still works with pvp when I find it, but no more one shot killing people. Trick now is to have the highest dps
---
I wouldn't say no to a free fridge or scavenger robot if you ever get the urge to give those for free. Lol.
---
&gt; I worked on GW2 as a game dev.
---
And yet even the "dataminer" you rely on for evidence has tried but failed to correct your misapprehensions.
---
u/eckserah:
---
&gt; I'm the person he credits on finding the seeding and I work with him on all of the bug stuff. I know who he is and I've explained it to him before as well. Just because there are seeds doesn't mean that it's bad.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drgccb/drop_chances_and_why_fallout_76_players_dont/f6j1ep7/
---
When you say you worked on GW2 as a game dev you did what, exactly?
---
That’s super nice! Thanks but I’m PS4
---
And now it’ll be an atomic shop special
---
I’d like to see the Flatwoods monster be the only source for legendary alien blasters. Would make finding him a truly special encouter
---
Still have 4 long coats for sale on Xbox if anyone wants any lmao
---
"Hey Bethesda, add more stuff from the game you didn't make since it's the most popular installation in the series."
---
This
---
ddaaaammmmnnnn lol
---
Tell that to the duster you get with FO 1st
---
The one petard I thought would never hoist me.
---
Have any questions? 
---
The only really weird thing on there is using a shotgun without any damage perks. That is for the enforcer perk. You don't actually need to do much damage at all to get the he cripple effect to work. I keep it around for fighting sheepsquatch and the like. 
---
I also don't use Martial Artist often as I would prefer to have blocker and barbarian but I do switch blocker out for it when fighting mostly ranged enemies in an area.
---
Idk why someone downvoted you. You’re correct, you can only get cells from the dome. 
---
Also the fusion conversion is permanent and neuters the damage to laughable levels so isn’t worth it. Not that it’s any prize in its base form but yeah
---
Awesome! Not just 76, everything just runs better on it, over the OG
---
*Your robot brings me junk* - dead lmaoooo
---
The paint is 500 atoms you mean? 
---
Cause I thought you were talking about the actual outfit. 
---
I got that for free. 
---
I went back to check. I only see the paint for 500.
---
Edit: Yeah. I'm dumb. 
---
I mean. It's just a color. Not that big of a deal really.
---
I'm glad to see there's still people on this sub that care about the game btw. I love it too. Also love NW. 😁
---
Did you expect ESO+ to give you a free lootcrate or house decoration each month? Chances are they’ll re-release the Ranger outfit and skins as regular atomic shop items for more than what 1st subscribers paid for them so I don’t see why you’re upset about getting what could potentially be a third off what non-subscribers would pay in the future
---
playing nw has a bad habit of completing challenges and not awarding atoms.
---
Does diluted radx suppress mutations like the the regular? And with some farming radshield is my go to it has more effect with zero suppression
---
"I'm taking the kids!"
---
"...."
---
"... And the dog!"
---
"!!!"
---
Forknife 🤣 I like it
---
They released a paint for the Ranger outfit today, in the Fallout 1st section. It's 500 atoms. I guess OP missed the part where Fallout 1st would "Give access to exclusive sales"
---
You've never seen it because they are usually momentarily. When it glitches out and you continue to take small amount of damage, you investigate and find it.
---
Not 100% sure all enviromental fire is applied through that, but it's some enviromental damage that just got stuck because your game failed to register you moving away from it. Or something like that.
---
ok boomer
---
Well its not that different from the creation club and those free pipboy skins they love to hand out
---
You can't respawn via your teammates using the map. You have to go to the Social Menu, click on their name, and then use the respawn option there.
---
Very nice work!
---
the meltdown vault raid is basically horde mode tbf
---
You can check my post history if you are that inclined, I worked with multiple teams there everything from server stability and client server parity, UI design, level design, AI routines, etc.
---
Most people who work in game development move around quite a bit to fill space when one team gets behind on deadlines.
---
As you'd see if you read further in that conversation I had with him you'd also see we ended up agreeing. I never said using seeds were bad, I said the way bethesda has implemented static seeds based on character/account is bad.
---
I like the two nuka cola bottles, personally
---
Oof this is weak AF. I do like the wallpaper tho.
---
Highest DPS, but also serendipity, dodgy, born survivor, etc = wins. People think it's unbalanced because they have 0 tank perks and all weight reduction and other QoL perks.
---
Some content
---
I always buy 556 to dump caps if i cant find anything in vendors
---
Yep medical wing in the whitespring bunker.  At max charisma they cost round 17.5k caps.  Lol it's what I do when i get close to the limit.
---
Yes please! Even just one.
---
I can't imagine spending monthly in this game and being satisfied. I could understand enjoying getting things from the atom store. I'm just picky, wait for sales, and complete a lot of atom challenges. I have over 4k and good bit of skins and items and spent zero.
---
Extremely unlikely. Fortnite didn't belong to a franchise that could count on 20 years of single player story heavy history.
---
Besides, what could they do with the mode besides moving the map around every now and then? Maps that they already have in their game by the way.
---
I don't think the F1st stuff is p2w, but I guess that's personal opinion. You're right, if it took off it would better fund the game, but I'm not sure if the BR craze is still going as strong. However if they were to find it more lucrative than the main game, just like FN it would be funneled for more NW development
---
They r pretty pointless right now I was so happy when I finally crafted mine then equally disappointed about 20 seconds later
---
Good idea! Bet don’t forget all of Bethesda’s suggestions that get out in the game you will most likely have to pay for them lol
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
I found info a long time ago that some loot was server tied so you got that explaned for me. I know loot is 20 hr but was wondering for like asylum runs if loot changed sort of thing. Sadly with how bad stuff is me and the wife maybe able to play together for maybe 30 mins b4 one of us crashes and its only why i would get 1st. Sadly...
---
Going hard on the scrap and repair kit bundle I see
---
I'm just waiting for items that have been gone since May to be back tbh. It's taking forever and I don't understand why :(
---
I dunno. Double barrel up their face?
---
The coming of Baby Jesus which is Fallout 1st
---
Yeah it’s really easy to do. I use a couch and a sit sign
---
Hey man im on ps4 i got one
---
Seen a few like that, ie play an instrument and then it glitches you underground, no idea how it’s done though
---
ok troglodyte
---
Thats good to know when the wife wont log in xD
---
[deleted]
---
beta is going for 5 months now and only minor changes outside of the map swap. there’s barely any $ to be made for them in nw anyway
---
Read again. I never asked for it to be nerfed. I just said it makes the gamer maybe too easy.
---
Yep, real crappy move on Bethesda
---
wat
---
Nuke zones are the reason I go with a heavy gunner build in power armor as bloodied. In ideal circumstances, unarmed melee or commando based bloodied builds can do more damage (not a ton though, heavy weapons are still very very good), but they aren't ridiculously tanky in pve unless you're running a full sentinel set, and even then you still have to deal with rads, which are much less of an issue in power armor.
---
If Zenimax can get their hands out of the coffers and stop micromanaging as it seems to be we could see 76 turn out for the better.. or at least improve a little
---
the new riot gear paint is 500 atoms, exclusive to first members lol
---
Or use the atoms to get when you purchase fallout1st. 1650 for $13 is better than buying atoms at cost
---
Well it should be exclusive as it says. 
---
Makes no sense for it to check if you have the outfit unlocked, while it reads exclusive to 1st.
---
You can’t be bad at cod zombies you start off learning. That’s all. Just get a group of friends and play black ops 2 town. Just play for survival and that only. You’ll have fun specially split screen.
---
Yeah, seems like they decided to split up the bulked part of the Armor into the standard, Elite and Advanced you can see here:  https://i.imgur.com/tZR4gZv.png
---
What are you trying to say? F2P won't bring in more revenue?
---
oh...i'm a slow burn player. rdr2 has been my go to for multiplayer. and digging outer worlds. i ranked up to about 150 in 76. have everything in game i could possibly want. recent events and even the vault stuff was way too buggy for me to get any enjoyment out of. but really, the biggest fault of 76 is just moving around in the world. on ps4 at least spending an hour in the world is a guaranteed migraine. literal migraine. i'm sure it's not as bad on pc. but yeah.
---
Yes!!! I’ll just my camp at fissure site prime. Thanks for saving me lots of time :)
---
They know they have the whales eating from their hands right now.
---
They are too worried about giving us stupid content instead of doing what people actually ask for. 
---
Same few types of walls from the start, just came out with wallpaper but it’s ugly as hell.
---
The developers come out with goofy comic book type stuff instead of the rustic apocalyptic type stuff survivors would actually build. 
---
It’s frustrating beyond belief!
---
Often, but I didn't want to be that guy to a team that was being cooperative!
---
Use the free atoms they give you
---
Wat? I got 1 free in the shop with my subscription. And now I can buy another one?
---
Ok?
---
What'll bring me back? Wastelanders.
---
What'll stop me from playing again? Finishing Wastelanders.
---
What would keep me playing? The locked items from F1st becoming available as rewards for serious amounts of grinding, not just because I happen to have a spare few dollars after  being an adult.
---
Science wing it's to the left if the medical wing. They're 17500 each with high charisma
---
The main game is making money though, and maybe it would still but it would be a shift that would possibly cause them to slow development on the main mode and shift to NW over ADV
---
VT Lunchboxes are reserved for the loot box system releasing next year.
---
the free atoms they gave me last month? or shall i pay for it again just for more atoms
---
Everything you said is 100% true
---
No
---
It's the Science wing
---
Ok thanks
---
So that's why my bot has only brought me bone and wood scraps.  He's giving all the good stuff to you!
---
Yep, there's more versions of the riot gear coming as well. They'll probably release every ranger gear from NV
---
I wouldn't call it a riot gear. It's just a differently color themed NCR ranger armor
---
Does it look cool? I got 1600 atoms and havent bought anything yet
---
I have a punch bowl with 9 Beers and 1 Nukashine. Letters above the bowl spell out,”Drink if you Dare.” If they drink, I give them a present, like a semi-rare plan or a Fusion Core.
---
it looks kinda the same honestly
---
Now that you speak of it. Weve only had 3 real buffs/nerfs
---
It's called riot paint in the shop, and the ranger gear is all just police riot gear with a trench coat
---
I did some texture edits and I gotta say the desert ranger is the best looking one if you're trying to save atoms, the riot one is also neat
---
I can't tell you how many times I've thrown grenades and fired an entire clip into the Sentry bot, watched it die in about 10 secs, maybe 15, and then I have ZERO loot. It happened probably 60-70% of the time during the event. Really disappointing. Not a fun event for me all-around. The lag was insane and I barely got to do anything except shoot at robots which isn't really all that special. Oh well! I did get some interesting loot and plans so that's cool I guess.
---
Oh ok, that’s what I thought 👍🏻
---
Not gunna happen. Unless the bugs make the game unplayable in any way, the smaller ones will get taken care of as an aside from patches and not the bugs you want fixed. 
---
There were still game breaking bugs in 4 and they didn’t spend any more time recourses and *money* on it. 
---
There’s no such thing as a simple bug. 
---
Still a daily player from launch so, it seems I am the exact target player Bethesda wants to reach. 
---
The people complaining about lack of context will still eat up any bones Beth throws at us in hours and you all will be back to square one begging for more, Oliver.
---
not really it was elder scrolls online
---
New game engine. Make the game not suck dick and a general pain in the ass to do anything. More space to hold stuff. Stop being so fucking greedy. No dupe glitches that ruin the economy. Add more monsters, add stuff to do, add actual faction wars between players. 
---
They had so much potential with the game but it’s just a cash grab. You can’t fix that.
---
They told you this before you bought the subscription. And you don’t hve to spend any atoms. Just like you didn’t hve to before. They said there would be 1st exclusive items for sale in the shop. This isn’t news.
---
Why not?
---
Yep and hardly any dungeons and most are small. I like NV but I think 3 gets far too much flak given how good it is.
---
Finally got it sorted, was a mission, but I survived! Cheers bud!
---
These bait threads are getting worse and worse.
---
Well, hiding in a bush was boring, so I had to entertain myself somehow...  :P
---
Did they ever say stuff would be free?
---
Like, if you actually paid for fallout 1st expecting atom shop stuff to be free... Then you should probably learn how to read. 
---
We got a free outfit and a free scrap box and a free movable tent and get 1650 atoms free.  Not free, but for either $100 a year or $12.99 a month.
---
It's like... Nothing is ever good enough.  Like 4 year old children.
---
The game was rigged from the start
---
Survival Mode was and is the worst balanced PvP mode that ever existed.
---
People that do things like that just to satisfy their own desires because they can don't deserve a place in the world.
---
I’ll admit, I’m fully pro micro transaction and fallout first but this made me “yikes” a little bit when I saw it in the store
---
That's how made hitlers bunker in fo76
---
Indeed...  I'm sure NW was prompted by someone looking at the success of Fortnite and saying we can make money that way too if we have a BR game mode.  So off they went creating yet another battle royale.  They launched it, sure it might have gotten some new people to buy the game, and then it just fizzled out.  Almost everyone I saw playing it stopped after they got to 100+ and got all the rewards unlocked, and all I see them on anymore is adventure mode if they're still playing the game.  Up until this past week that is.
---
Maybe its Zenimax and not Todd at fault - I don't really know, but its sad to see them try so hard to copy other games instead of focusing on their core strengths.  Storytelling, creating immersive game worlds, BGS has always been good at those things.
---
One small thing would be to add new drops to the existing public events. Fashnacht, meat week, mischief night, are all busy because of the new stuff you can get. I'd like to see some old atom shop outfits and camp plans rewarded for stuff like guided meditation and similar events. Heck even adding in new "survival" legendary items would be fun. I can't imagine those are difficult to create.
---
good point... 😅
---
thanks for the post you’re a hero. The actual items are the worst ever imo...
---
I think my problem was I didn't have anyone to play with Regularly. Never got into the grind to improve by myself.
---
That's not quite what he's suggesting. The problem isn't that the drives are plugged in. He's saying if you have the game installed on an external hard drive, you need to power cycle the external drive. This involves completely unplugging the drive long enough for it to fully power down.
---
If you don't have Fallout 76 installed on an external hard drive, this wouldn't apply.
---
One thing to note: there are two types of "hard drives" - a traditional hard drive with moving parts (HDD), and a solid state drive (SSD). The SSD will have much better performance in general. It does help somewhat with Fallout 76, but it doesn't completely eliminate lag spikes in NW. It does decrease them slightly, but if you noticed them before, you'll still notice them.
---
Aye just checked it out, thanks! The whole outfit seems a bit greener to me, except the helmet.
---
Go away
---
Like taking brains from a zombie
---
Trying to clarify what you're saying, tell me where I'm wrong. 
---
You're saying the people working on NW are the same people that work on adventure mode. If Nuclear Winter is making more money they will work on adventure mode less instead of just hiring more people to work on Nuclear Winter.
---
The all american
---
(Referring to the Akimbo)
---
1. Wouldn’t make sense
---
2. Bethesda would never do it.
---
And then the Tofurkeysquatch in the next encrypted event
---
I did. I sucked hella bad at first. Just get a small group of friends to mess around with. It’s actually really fun.
---
Would you pay a $13 entry fee at Walmart
---
what would i be reading if they never said it? y’all mad all the time, it was posted under discussion, not be a constant fuckin asshole 🤥
---
It is weird they would charge for a slightly different color of the same armor. I cant imagine it being worth 5 bucks to anyone for that armor to be green instead of grey but oh well. To each his own.
---
Sure, let's just rage till the dawn off time and just never get a community request added.
---
I got the suit with shorts on the literally last event lol
---
On now
---
You forgot to mention you one shot deathjaws 😂😂
---
Maybe one day. For now I've moved on, don't really play COD anymore.
---
I actually enjoy spoiled meat with a drink of Sulphur Water to wash it down.
---
Wow this is the first time I’ve witnessed a public mental breakdown lol
---
I don't put much stock in that blog. He only ever covers one game at a time which is kinda fishy, it's not like other controversies and insider leaks don't exist in other games while he's "covering" a specific game. Why doesn't he put those on his blog while he's leading campaigns against those other games? Is it because he's following outrage culture to get page views?
---
EDIT: example, he stopped covering Anthem when people stopped caring about Anthem. Could it be he stopped getting insider info on Anthem? No, he could probably still have a finger on that pulse but Anthem outrage is over so he moved onto F76 outrage, which was suspiciously absent while he was covering Anthem
---
Had this once. Just finished a NW game, joined for another match, got kicked out, joined again, could play normally.
---
I did too. Tried it. Still do
---
The orange space suit isn’t new is it wasn’t it in the space bundle?
---
Oh hail no, you didn't just say that.
---
Why is this the fucking topic of the day?  Jesus christ...
---
You guys get talking points like the goddamn Trump administration....
---
End game content
---
k
---
I agree. It seems counterintuitive, though. I think that a lot of people who are wanting more budget to build larger, more elaborate camps are partly building for the entertainment (and appeciation) of strangers. I built a cultist chapel with a secret underground dungeon specifically for the fun and amusement of others: to create an unusual experience. I get such a kick out of interacting with people there! That's one of the nicer things about FO76 - having someone come along and spam hearts at you because they appreciate the time you've put into crafting something. Not that I need constant praise or anything :-) but hopefully you get what I mean!
---
Me neither, I’ve actually started playing Oblivion again...Fallout 76 is kind of dead to me. 😂. At least until Wastelanders comes out. I just hope this Fallout 1st thing is a membership where players get the new things first. Which is like a bug testing group. Then after I hope this stuff releases to the regular players like myself. I just hope thats the case.
---
Thank you!
---
[https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/316264/4](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/316264/4) but but.. They so crazy.
---
Yes
---
Irony of ironies, this is the first time I ever did the 'grind for atoms' thing. And nothing to spend them on. :'(
---
Nw is just lame. If i wanted BR id play Apex
---
Thanks
---
How about a 3* hunters rolled newspaper to squash the bugs
---
Same here. I only got pumpkin plans and the grim reaper vault boy. RNG sucks...I did around 20 events.
---
Bloodied ,Swing Speed , +1 strength  I would gladly take that
---
&gt;I don’t get people who are primarily pvp players. You are doing the same thing over and over again. Don’t you get bored of that? Oh you see someone that sucks let’s cream them. Oh there’s someone good, challenge accepted. And so on and so forth. Just seems so pointless lol. 🤷‍♂️
---
Some people appear to be motivated by competition, whereas others are not. The motivation for winning, putting forth effort, improving one's performance, performing well, being instrumental, and expressing  forceful/aggressive behavior.
---
People enjoy PvP for the same reason people enjoy playing sports. It's aesthetically pleasing. Like the theater, it is a venue for emotional expression. It's an escape from real-world troubles. It provides a sense of belonging, a connection to a wider world.
---
The only thing I'm going to uncurl my fingers for is the freaking opossum skin hat when is that coming back.
---
Yeah rip bloodied builds and melee builds in pvp
---
I did better at fashnacht by hitting the closest train station after the event - picked up a couple nice legendary weapons that worked well with/for my sub L50 character.
---
Missed the first meatweek, so ground the second.  Got the tenderize, flags, and the spicy plan.
---
Mischief, RNG smiled upon me, and I ended up with everything except the mobster pumpkin and the short suit.
---
Bonus:  the 3\* ghouls in the laundry area just before the event started dropped 3\* stuff.  Got a 3\* VE double barrel shotgun, 3\* troubleshooters mole miner gauntlet, and a 3\* instigating meathook from them.
---
Yeah exclusive discounts. Like half price on some new items or wallpaper pack for 400 atoms while the store offers it for 800. I agree and I’m sure it’s coming. I know what I paid for and I’m happy with that but I don’t have to enjoy the peddling of additional goods. Just like I enjoy the game but I sure didn’t enjoy crashing three times last night. Twice to just trying to eat in game. Doesn’t mean I hate the game now i just sure would like to spend one week in it without something failing me.
---
as other's have said - it's the most lacklustre / sparse week yet. 
---
As much as I want to go to bat for them honestly not sure what they are thinking tbh other then trying to drain the impatient of atoms.
---
... You've seen the power armor skins, right?
---
Most of my friends left due to lack of content, makes a stale gameplay loop of legendary/caps farm then log.
---
As for myself, i take breaks after i find myself getting in to that loop.
---
Content added has been fun, but few and far between for the rate alot of us consume content.
---
Hypothetically if me and say one or two buds just leveled up alts to 50ish or so and have completed base game content including sqb, we could complete all the new content that is not time gated in one weekend. Consume not master.
---
Buy ok gear drom player vendors.Do biv, advance to tadpole, hit up arktos and campfire tales, complete sheepsquatch questline and complete encryptid.
---
From there do a couple nw matches and mabey win overseer title. Come back and do burrows, charleston capital, and morgantown airport. Finally we could end by running a vault on novice.
---
Not a dis on quality, just what it is.
---
U got free atoms right?
---
It was incredible how quickly they released BR into the game - they have rolled the dice and unlike Survival Mode, I suspect they've sunk in a ton of money/dev time/resources to build Nuclear Winter.  I'm sure they're asking themselves how they can monetize it back - but the bulk of their monetization comes from adventure mode players.
---
already spent your discounted atoms eh?
---
My challenges are regularly being auto completed every single week and the last time I played NW was in June so it's just a rumor that it has any effects.
---
I was on playing on PS4 but stopped playing as of today. I was lvl 30 doing the quest that required me to find the location of the brotherhood of steel. 
---
Why did I stop playing? 
---
My gear is constantly broken, my stashbox is full all of the time and resources are scarce. There’s just not much fun stuff to do, en-route to my destination I encountered enemies 40 lvls above mine and a scorchbeast popped out of the ground in front of me forcing me to run. Only when my diseased self (no cures) finally reached the ‘safety’ of the asylum I encountered a wendigo, it killed me, pathetically easy.
---
There and then I got so fed up that I deleted FO76 entirely, I gave it more than enough chance. 
---
What would make me come back?
---
Honestly, if the performance wasn’t horrible I’d take almost everything else for granted, I dont expect 60 fps but in it’s current state it is just an unplayable, boring, frustrating mess.
---
Hahha paywall behind a Paywall! Genius!! It just works
---
I don't recall getting "free" atoms. I got 1650 Atoms as part of my monthly membership.
---
I was surprised by that, as well. Didn't it JUST fall under a 'vaulting' sale a week or two ago??
---
Better yet, how about they fix the broken/bugged stuff before adding new skins and mechanics that will just break more stuff.
---
Spend those fancy atoms you got. They told you there would be exclusive items available to buy in the shop when you signed up.
---
Ha. People have been saying this for a year.
---
Right? That's kinda how I feel right now 🤣
---
Completely agree, I’m pro micro transactions and fallout first but this is a little bit insane, blew my mind earlier when I refreshed the store
---
So basically u won the lottery and couldnt find your ticket
---
I know almost everyone responding to me is a head trip
---
People are free to spend their money as they see fit. But if people decide to purchase such a service, it encourages the company to push their monetisation experiments further and further, to keep pushing the boundaries. Ultimately they don’t care who complains, so long as people pay.
---
Actual difficultly. Spend all this time to perfect a build, but to what end? A tiny handful of challenging creatures.
---
None of this 'nerf yourself' type bs either.
---
Should just make the fireplace snap to a wall surface like a painting. More flexibility is better.
---
Didn't someone here request adding the exclusive 1st skins/outfits in the atom shop after a certain amount of time had passed?
---
Guess they get what they asked for....
---
Perhaps winning atoms based on minutes survived (1 per 5 minutes) in NW, how certain kills are achieved like downing enemies with headshots or executing them with melee weapons, it could increase some interest that way maybe
---
I relate; when I am not paying attention, I sing quietly. I have to be careful about the mic, or people are going to hear me giggle like an idiot while I belt out, "buck-buck-buckET!"
---
Anthem was advertised as a live services game and Destiny was supposed to be an mmo styled game.
---
You can't be those types of games and have no content. Which is why people complained.
---
OW is a single player rpg it has as much content as FO3 or Skyrim for the main story and like those games you can get more play time if you do side quests.
---
How are you staggering her if she’s not on the ground?
---
What bugs are you referring to?
---
I think you meant exterminators but I  understand the typos I'm excited too if we actually get this free legendary weapon each month
---
It is incredibly rare, and yes it should probably be in its own category lol
---
Cool.
---
I do get your point, just annoyed.
---
I can't afford the rent. I am EXACTLY $12.99 short, and will be every month going forward. Can we negotiate?
---
I could agree, like a premier access pass. I don't think the scrap box will ever become available though. 
---
I still have a great time with the game, despite it's issues and Drama. It's really the only way I relax. 
---
I honestly believe the people blow it way out of proportion for the most part. Whatever kind of monkey games they pull, it's not going to stop me from relaxing and enjoying the game.
---
I thought about picking Oblivion back up, but I have wayyy too many other games I want to play. (PUBG, Borderlands 3, RAGE 2 etc) not to mention I want to restart New Vegas (my save data corrupted and I never got to finish) and play FO3 again.
---
The whole point of using the Austin team was doing both projects at the same time.
---
Criticals are 100% accuracy though. I have TS on a plasma pistol. It does not seem to miss any shots during criticals. It is a projectile weapon though, so maybe it works differently than TS on hit scan weapons.
---
Did it occur to you to say something? lol
---
You're welcome!
---
Modify the Ranger Armor you get with 1st, you’ll be able to change the appearance there as if it were normal armor or weapons :) it’ll be the same for future skins as well
---
?
---
Good warning.
---
ah thank you
---
Haha I felt this comment!
---
I get a strong Mass Effect vibe from it, along with Borderlands.
---
It's really not like Fallout much other than them sharing a genre.
---
Yeah it succs lol
---
And it's level 150+ players doing it, too. 
---
I just quit the last SBQ fight, because I got tired if wasting ammo and waiting.
---
This guy didn't study MTX development ☝
---
Not Walmart that's poor people stuff, maybe for Amazon Prime.  /s
---
I had to take a break from Boderlands 3 and RAGE. 😂 I don’t agree about the Fallout 1st membership I honestly hate what the they did with it. But I’m not going to troll someone for spending their money I just hope that the people that do invest in it get results. For example, i hope the money they spend on that service goes back into the game to make it better. Though at this point I highly doubt it.
---
Played a single game of NW on PC, I see.
---
lol it me but with whistling "I didn't know the gun was loaded" but just that part
---
Many a true nerd has a real good video on it, I basically parroted a lot of his arguments. He has like 30 minutes just running down all the choices and solutions there are in the tutorial area for fallout 3. One of the things he points out a lot of people don't really know. You can unlock dialog options in 3 and in NV, but the difference is NV greys it out, 3 hides it, until those unlock conditions are met. So in many cases in 3 you aren't even aware of different solutions that would have been presented as greyed out options  in NV.
---
The funny thing is for someone who is obviously so butthurt about the subscription, his sarcastic  post actually inadvertently explains why the subscription isn’t p2w lol
---
You knew what you signed up for. *shrug*
---
I would love a rolled-up newspaper weapon
---
Green.
---
I am letting it go by spreading the word of Baby Jesus's endorsement of Fallout 1st
---
If Bethesda gets the idea to release “premium” items to 1st subscribers first and then to everybody else after, it would work out like ESO+ letting those with a subscription save 1/4 - 1/3 of the price but that’s wishful thinking. Otherwise everyone was warned
---
Two totally different scenarios... But okay
---
I believe that most of them are in there, which ones are you referring to? There is a good chance I missed some! Lol
---
I've got no idea. I've been able to craft it for sometime though.
---
Fallout 1st offers monthly items with the sub, not weekly.
---
Did the same thing. Tried it for about 5-10 hours when it came out but didn't feel that drive to continue. Totally worth it since it saved me 60 bucks.
---
```
---
[Primed Disappointment]
---
Wait...wrong game, sorry.
---
PSA: If you have a stagger perk and you shoot her in the air, she won't land. It messes up her AI.
---
No one does. I'm mostly referring to lame ass troll posts.
---
Yes they do. And look, mmogfails was right yet again. Fallout f you first makes paid members buy exclusive items for atoms. Lol this is hilarious. Enjoy it whales! You brought it upon yourself.
---
You’re most welcome
---
I am fairly sure it's coming next year. It wasn't bound to wastelanders but its postponement was mentioned little before wastelanders were.
---
I was more intrested in that than the wastelanders anyway. Even if it's probably a minor thing and even if I can max it all the moment it drops. When latter was delayed I didn't much care.
---
Bruh they put those bundles out just to finagle 'em
---
There's an animation when you stagger her in the air, where she throws her head back, jerkily flaps her wings, and roars, that restarts her AI cycle. As long as she keeps being staggered, she won't land. If you've fought the SBQ before, you know what animation I'm talking about.
---
So for 500 caps you can change Ranger gear colors from drab-olive to olive... Am I reading this correctly?
---
I don't play now, but check back from time to time. If this happens, I will come back.
---
I won't sub because that's effing dumb, but I will come back.
---
Any and all. Just to name a few when I stopped playing there was, T-posing scorched, mutins with no skin it's the face, falling through the world, server crash causing tou to lose the workshop you just built up, ext...
---
Never heard of that. I never shoot at her in the air 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I had to jump off a building to fix it for myself.
---
Maybe if they remove VATS from survival it would have been interesting. As it stands, VATS just makes it a gear/build check, where the only skill required is in getting the jump on someone, which certain setups can trivialize anyway.
---
In other words, it's not worth keeping around in it's current iteration.
---
If something comes over from NV it should be Big Iron.
---
Stop giving them ideas - its bad enough how they can't even cope with the cheaters now.  But yes - it seems like NW will be hobbled along by tying in a bunch of carrot strings to the game mode.  We've just seen the tip of the iceberg here.
---
Collectors will collect - which is something every game has, and those players will be suckered into playing NW to help keep it alive.
---
I can definitely share that sense of Doubt, but I'll remain hopeful nonetheless 😅
---
I think they made the decision to go this route from a Business standpoint only. I feel they may be getting desperate, and this was a risky move as such. 
---
I'm curious to see what wastelanders brings regardless though.
---
I wouldn't call them free exactly.
---
I can confirm. I had this happen on PC and support just had me reinstall.
---
I only have two endurance so I don't have enough to equip the Aquaboy perk. Is there anything at the bottom of the lake near the dam or is it just empty?
---
I fight the sbq several times a day but wasting ammo is not part of my strategy lol
---
And the existing events that are supposed to be like waves are jacked up, either having a pitiful amount of enemies or enemies not turning up for several minutes at a time.
---
You don't have to do anything.
---
I hope that them moving Wastelanders back and this membership is a means to improve Wastelanders. We shall see in the future though right?
---
So much is broken in this game that superstition and rumor are all in the category of "crazy but plausible". Only piece of data I have on this is the 200+ atoms I've lost from auto-completing challenges that has only happened once after I played NW before launching Adventure mode. If you're losing atoms every week from these challenges auto-completing then that's truly awful... keep filing those tickets, take screenshots and videos.
---
My email client somehow ate the reply from Bethesda support and I only found the reply to my ticket too late to take action. Hopefully if enough people report the issue then maybe they'll fix it. They did say in response to mine that they were actively looking into it... that was back in early September.
---
Well that's a bunch of hot garbage. I want the Red Rocket bundle to come back, hoping it shows up for Black Friday
---
Yeah I would really like to use other grenades than molotovs too. I have lots of them all. Can't even tag enemies properly with grenades because they go all over. Much less than severly hurt or kill.
---
But that particular suggestion wouldn't be perfect. I think they should bounce, but maybe less and in more controlled way.
---
You have never shoved a hose up a dead horses ass and out of its mouth I'm sure once you put your mouth on the hose and suck in the horse will drink.
---
Thank you very much for not being part of the problem! Still, please spread the word.
---
Yep they’ve all been fixed. Server stability is never  guaranteed in any online game so that’s just a chance you’ll have to take.
---
Also why did mutants with no skin on their face make you quit the game?
---
Elaborate why you think that they will not make any sense?
---
I will keep an eye out for that happening and make sure to properly yell at everyone when i see it. Thanks for the info.
---
No. We had Flatwoods for months.
---
lol yep - it was pretty clear this was going to be the case - not that I think it was the greatest decision.
---
I'm just disappointed they didn't try to do much else.
---
I actually agree with  you - the op is wrong in my opinion.
---
Stealth might be a valid strategy but also it is utterly boring and I don't think in the spirit of a team based battle royale situation. Teams may have well not have existed this week....
---
I think that I would have enjoyed working as a proper team / squad more....but couldn’t as I had do to farm. I guess that highlights a problem with how things are scored in NW - downing someone / killing someone is 10xp or so (I killed a few people so perhaps I am not a truly focused bush hider) whereas the real xp is linked to how long you survive
---
You stopped typing to early I'm sure it was going to be No way that's awesomely fantastic
---
and the colors are almost the same? they hardly look different at all for $5!
---
I meant, to include which one are craftable.
---
$1.00 per hour?  F76 is expensive to play IMO.  Per hour of play F76 for me was 10, 20, or 100 times more expensive than other games.  Players can bring that down with a long run of the game, but that's a 50:50 chance if the player loves/hates playing F76.  Is F76 worth this kind of utter rage &amp; frustration?  No!  Come on, you got to be kidding me.  Something like 42,000,000 people didn't buy/play this game.
---
Does it even offer monthly items? It seems ambiguous on the fallout 1st page. It looks like it could be read "Monthly atoms. Also this free outfit." But because it's together, people are reading it as monthly items and outfits.  
---
The exact wording: "Recieve monthly atoms and an exclusive fallout outfit!" (And the picture is the ranger armour outfit)
---
And? I'm not saying to remove Morgantown I'm saying to make both maps playable because some people prefer Flatwoods over Morgantown and vice versa and it's not some impossible feat to implement a rotation.
---
I lost 100 atoms on a Tuesday because of that. I forgot you need to hop into adventure mode before you go into NW because of this exact bug. At the beginning of this bug, I would actually get the atoms, but then the challenges would say I completed them without actually rewarding the atoms.
---
What's your gamertag?
---
Anthem and D2 are live service multiplayer games, akin to an MMO. They need a constant stream of content to keep people playing. TOW is not that. TOW is a single-player FPS-RPG that doesn't *require* (as Anthem and D2 do) more content to continue it's play-ability.
---
Well someone has to be on the low end of the RNG, because you know there's someone who got one every single time had a drop rate well above the average.
---
I got 7 outfits (not counting the common outfits available in the base game) in 15 runs so I hit about a 50% drop rate.
---
Steam runs EXCELLENT seasonal sales, as well as random franchise sales, and you can pick things up for ridiculously little. Then you don't need to get a disk drive, AND you didn't pay full price. :D
---
Shit, didn't even see your comment before stating the same thing. Thanks for reinforcing it though.
---
Wow such obnoxious and offensive language there are preteen children that play this game please keep the comments PG.
---
Fire Todd that's funny. I dreamed he had a button under his desk like Matt Lauer and Lady Devann comes in. They've made a good game, it has bugs like all beth games. They tried survival at least, but the numbers were in adventure (from what I've gathered on the forum). The br is fun if they would police it.
---
Did your other account get banned and if so how many my guy?
---
I like this...give reason to have a few sets of gear for different situations
---
That's the Hope, my Guy. From what I read, many people are holding Wastelanders as their Last Hope for the game.
---
Single player game as product tends to have little grind or micro transactions compared with multi player game as a service to be fair. It also helps TOW that there was a market for the single player experience that has contributed to and catalyzed the criticisms of FO76.
---
&gt;I get why developers do it, but there are consequences.  Obsidian should be wise to this concept, given how their games roll in them.
---
As far as I know Obsidian has monetary issues and I kinda understand why they accepted Epic's quick cash. When they completed Fallout New Vegas, Bethesda promised them bonuses if the game had at least 85 metacritic but the game had 84 so Bethesda did not give them any, this forced Obisdian to lay down a lot of their developers to avoid bankrupcy. Then while they were developing Outer Worlds, they almost went bankrupt and they were at the point of cancelling Outer Worlds when they were purchased by Microsoft.
---
Oh well, its the internet, it happens.
---
And yes, i remember the alien blaster just being a novelty more than anything
---
"FTP" is just as taboo as "P2W", either one gets some factuon in here all up in arms, and downvoting.
---
You may also want to avoid "MTX", and "1st", as well.
---
Didn't have my mic on, or I would have given um the ole EH-HEM throat clear.
---
Who's trolling I'm just spreading the good word of Baby Jesus and Fallout 1st.
---
Don't forget! The map will be bigger! There will be more detail! It will be the most complex game they have ever made! And, of course, they will say not a single word about bugs...
---
Until after a buggy game drops (because it's Bethesda, and which of their games "just works"?) Then they'll be "working on it". And then paid mods will happen.
---
Mark my words.
---
And you're surprised?  That's why I gave up on the game.  They don't fix the actual known bugs.
---
No, they’re saying that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges.
---
Considering they seem to be following the ESO monetization route, maybe it's not just wishful thinking
---
Some people like to stock up on food and water in case they die of hunger. So perhaps if we up the difficulty so that wasteland is all about not dying then maybe add an extra reward for treking long distance and coming back. Also make it so that it's surivial horror where death is immersion breaking and puts u back into easy mode. easy mode is where a player has eden's heavenly guardian glow and it's easier. A semi-hardcore mode?
---
So probably a game mode like MvM?
---
Great idea for 500 Atoms you could choose the weapon.
---
Cool, guess I'll make sure to keep one gun army on at all times.  If I let her land I risk some buttmunch one shotting it and ruining the event for everyone else.
---
Errrrrr... we still have to pay atoms for paints on fallout 1st stuff wtf?! Are they fucking joking?
---
Outside of Battle Royale gear/build *should* play a massive difference into whether you win or lose. If you can have whatever shitty build and gear you want and still win then there isn't any point into specializing your character. My character I made for survival mode is a full health that runs Serendipity, Dodgy, Life Giver, and a bunch of other survivability perks. My character should be harder to kill because I sacrifice QoL perks for these ones. Just my opinion. It wasn't perfect but if you PvP often you will 100% tell when someone has a build for it and someone who doesn't. Some people are *impossible* to kill due to their build and skill. Gotta have both in an MMO.
---
How about no? I'm an adult and therefore can speak how I wish. Thanks.
---
The Sims is no more or less monetized than it has ever been. The DLCs cost more than they used to, but that was 20 years ago; everything costs more.
---
The issue is not the cost, but how little you GET for the cost... and that is where your comparison shines.
---
You should know by now, every day, always log into Adventure mode first before NW.  Not saying it's right or that it shouldn't be fixed, just that it's the only workaround we have at this point.
---
On PC there is a high probability someone could make a mod to highlight mobs, like.... players.
---
Gotcha, I have tried to list plan locations if there is a set location for them but I could list them as craftable as well! Thats a good idea
---
Im curious, do you have screenshot of this? Never seen it here or in F4.
---
The level of the loot.
---
1) How many bobbleheads do you have?
---
2) Are you using any game mods?
---
3) What happens if you put them on displays?
---
It’s just an exclusive item on the shop. I really don’t see the big deal. Plenty of other services have these type of member exclusive deals.
---
Probably easier to change ur current character but better If u made a new one cuz then u would have 2 different builds already set up with their certain weapons armor and perks
---
I got 1650 for $8.33
---
I suppose you can consider 825 atoms free
---
no where in my posts did i mention anything about rage.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I think we may have to accept that these people were more able to objectively see Bethesda's buggy games, whereas I was just so damned excited for another Fallout, I didn't even care what it was. I assumed it would be buggy. I assumed a lot of people would hate it. But I expected another Fallout.
---
What I got was... close-ish, but I love it. People can hate on me if they like, but it changes nothing.
---
yes but you can't load into the game with "standard" fallout 76 mods.
---
3rd party hacking tools are a completely different story, and there's no need to highlight players with an aimbot and the ability to make your bullets clip through everything including terrain.
---
It’s not $5. It’s 500 atoms. And even if you did want to convert to $, it would be less than $2.50 considering 1st members get 19,800 atoms for $100 (roughly 50 cents per atom) and that’s not even counting the other things they get for $100 subscription.
---
Switching to a USB 3.0 SSD mostly eliminated this problem for me. Instead of lagging for a couple of seconds like you're describing, the lag has been reduced to a fraction of a second for me now. Most of the lag I experience now is the network handshake that occurs when the server recognizes that I'm in proximity of other players and switches from passive monitoring of distant players to an active interaction with local players.
---
yep
---
I think it was in the advertisements for Fallout 1st that they'd do this.
---
Yeah...played New Vegas again a few months ago. Historically, FPS Fallout has been less "tactile" when it comes to hitting and shooting enemies. The feel isn't as accurate as you would hope, but it was good enough not to complain. Even FO4 was good enough for me, and I enjoyed playing the storyline...although the idea of "where is my baby!?! Oooh...side mission" was tough to reconcile, being a father.
---
It was FO76 where the shortcomings were exacerbated. If you play a game like Destiny or The Division 1/2, you find how coop games require intensive coding to provide the gun/weapon responsiveness. When I shoot someone in these games...leg...chest...arm...head...you feel your shot exit the weapon, and see the impact on the target. Even online, you feel it. The tactile experience is fulfilling, and doesn't require suspension of disbelief. I don't have to make an excuse as to why the enemies are squishy, or why I can swing my sword 10 times and find the enemy only reacts to 3 of my hits.
---
It was coming back to FO76 from TD2 that had me really recognizing how poorly this part of the game was implemented. The shortcomings of FO4 were more apparent when they put it online, and there has been no improvement in the quality of this feedback in the gameplay. Forget the bugs, duping, and concerns about the quest/story/camp building...the fact that it doesn't feel good shooting or slashing enemies is my problem. I don't enjoy it.
---
Seriously...the sensation of taking a sword to an enemy, or shooting an enemy, in the game, does not work. Go to other similar games, and then come back and try it. It's noticeably inferior.
---
It's not that I don't think Bethesda is incapable of addressing this, but it's not been a priority. In the business, I recognize that you have a list of what keeps the lights on, and what keeps people happy, and sometimes basic function keeps falling off the priority list, but I find it surprising that there hasn't been an investment in this area over the past 5+ years.
---
I am a person who pre-orders. I know, it's bad, but I have plenty of money and I get what interests me. Fallout is in my top 5 as far as game universes (The Last of Us, Witcher,  Bioshock, and Mass Effect being the others). Fallout now joins Mass Effect as a Legacy Franchise, for me, personally. Still in my top 5 universes, but I'll be holding my preorders in the future.
---
how do you mute the mic when youre using a controller?
---
More content. Repeating one week events such as meat week I dont class as content. I haven't played since the last meat week event due to there being nothing for me to do. I even hopped on to try out the mischief night event, i completed one, crashed on the other two attempts and got quickly bored. Wastelanders was my glimmering hope at something for me to do but unfortunately it got pushed back alongside  other things that piqued my interest like the legendary player system. I'm almost sure I remember reading on the bethesda page when vault 94 was opened that in the weeks following that vault 63 would open but that didn't happen either. Bugs are another story, at first I didn't really notice them as time went in I found some amusing but towards the end of my time playing I just found them frustrating which affected my positive playing experience. Games got great potential and i still love it but until i have something to do theres no reason for me to log on.
---
This would be great, but if/when they do, it'll be added to the atom shop for $7...
---
Hot mic arguments are the only thing I miss about 76!
---
For Wastelanders to have enough Depth, immersive lore filled daily quests given out by human NPCs, locally hosted 4-6 player servers separate from Fallout 1st, offline mode, regular community events, more C.A.M.P structures like the wood and metal shacks in Fallout 4, outfits and weapon skins from Fallout 3, Atom point rewards for surviving x amount of time or getting “execution” style downs or kills in NW
---
My personal list of improvements some I’m aware are bad ideas
---
Me too same story
---
If you didn't spend $8.33, would you have still got 825 for "free"?
---
the rad resis was never broken - it was just mistakenly labelled . The  disease resis on those "buggy" pieces was already there
---
Yep
---
Bugs brake the RP of the game.
---
Private server
---
They explicitly stated it will remain available
---
I didn't saw you listed the plan, nice work on the whole thing :)
---
Follow the main quest.
---
No, they're saying that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges, that bloodied builds are the only builds that kill things in a reasonable amount of time without them feeling like ridiculous bullet sponges.
---
No you can’t get the keg plan it’s in the camp menu but you can’t get it as a reward like the cool mounted heads (Mothman, SBQ, mirelurk Queen) &amp; the empty pumpkin rack from this halloween event which wasn’t available either
---
Ah thanks for the info.
---
This thing only works when crouched, so they should be able to fix it, as it clearly works, just not as intended.
---
I'm just hoping that when they release the datamined Nuka-Cherry paint job in the shop, it's a free skin like how it is in the Creation Club
---
This is as dumb as the PS+ free game argument.
---
It's like I bought a sandwich and they toss in a drink for free.
---
The drink is free... Those other Atoms are free in my eyes.
---
I got Atoms for 50% off... Plus a free junk stash, tent, and Ranger outfit.
---
I sure hope so.
---
I mean, after all, people paid for it, so the outfit and the emotes better stay, or there might be the next shitstorm. O.O
---
Bugs are Beth - just too much misdirection and wasted time chasing things on the periphery with 76, its like they lost sight of the big picture and are caught up chasing down every penny instead.
---
What?
---
Did corporate shilling poison your mind already?
---
I played it all the time. There *is something fun about running around the Wasteland trying to like complete quests and take over Workshops while being hunted by roving packs of marauders
---
They just need a "tag with a pistol and wait" emote. That would cover at least three issues.
---
Depends on how much of a change you need but I'd also say rebuilding this one should be easier because levelling a character from the start is really painful.
---
He means like a player clan I believe.
---
But the drink is only free if you buy the sandwich. It's not an argument. You have your opinion, I have mine. No one is wrong. The statement can be spun any way to fit anyone's rhetoric.
---
Lol aesthetics are everything, friend request sent
---
Point taken.
---
  I misread OPs post.
---
yes, i understand that's a good feeling and even better when you gain good weapons, but i am unable to properly 'farm' by server hopping and killing the same boss over and over again.. it takes the joy out of me
---
It is a waste, if only we could get a moonwalk emoji/dance too.
---
I use underground camps for a while now to protect my more valuable stuff from NPC attacks. Works wonders, and it's really easy to do with pretty much any chair?instrument and a set of stairs. I feel like it reduced my camp being attacked by at least 90% - even in places like the mire.
---
Damn, so that's where the extra scrip I've been getting has been coming from. I've been wondering about that.
---
What are your main changes going to be? Rifleman to commando is pretty easy, but pure melee to plasma commando is a bit of a change.
---
Evolved, or Devolved?
---
That is the question.
---
Because F76 was 2015-2018  &amp;&amp;  TOW was 2016-2019.  But the players are 1997-2019.
---
I don't quite understand why a spacesuit wouldn't have radiation protection lol. It look's like John Glenns spacesuit and I'd imagine that was designed for radiation protection, nonetheless respiration in a vacuum.
---
I will whistle or hum if I don't know the words. And whistling usually sounds terrible in a mic. Oops... :/
---
Care to share the look of the new skin?
---
Well, if you factor in all the glitches and bugs the game launched with it makes perfect sense why an obscure clothing item doesn’t have rad resistance...
---
I currently use a shotgun build and I'm switching to a two handed build so..
---
Seems like a solid reason. Also, I guess the question is: what do you say?
---
"Ahem! Excuse me, sir? Do you have a moment to talk about keeping your marital issues off the internet?"
---
At the very least, a spacesuit backpack with a rad resist mod would be cool.
---
There's no way to really answer the question without knowing your current build and your desired build.  
---
If you need like 30 level ups to make all the changes it would probably be faster just to make a new character as you need less xp per level in the beginning.  Also, with a lvl 61 character you can farm up recipes and craft maxed out basic weapons and armor for a new character.   
---
You'd be shocked at how good a full set of heavy leather armor with the studded mod is up to lvl 40 or so assuming you craft a new set every 10 or so levels.  A brotherhood recon sniper rifle modded with 50 cal and 5k rounds will destroy everything for the first 40ish levels again assuming you craft a new one every so often to keep up with the levels you gain.
---
you asked for this the moment you signed up
---
I’m level 150 junkie heavy/explosive build. I have 30 points saved for my re-build into junkie rifles. Prob need 5-10 more points to do it. Want to beat the game before I do such a drastic move...
---
Didn’t know this, I’ll take off my stagger perks
---
Oh I totally know what you mean. If I was in this predominantly for building's sake I would be playing FO4, the more stable game with a buttload of free mods that make the essentials of building 1000x better. xD
---
The thing is, Bethesda specifically mentioned camp budget and adjacency in their article about the Fallout 1st sub. It didn't sound like they were planning to raise the budget for adventure mode. So while yea, I want to build stuff others can see, it seems like it's either I build bigger stuff on a private world or I continue with the pretty limited camp building that's currently available in adventure mode. 
---
In the end I think folks like us who want to build and share in 76 will just have to kind of get together and create communities to visit one another on private worlds and share each other's places in online forums.
---
What's MTX?
---
Not trying to be an asshole.
---
Lol now you know. Should be able to get over 200 scrip a day, with the 150 from weapons. I get cop a squatter as soon as I log in and if I don’t do it first, then for some reason it doesn’t give me any rewards.
---
Might end up going that route. Still definitely getting ES6 used if Fallout 1st doesn't stop treating me like a walking wallet. 
---
Thing is, I don't mind giving money to devs and such. Would gladly get the Fallout 1st subscription if all it was was private servers and monthly atoms. But when the subscription gives me a marked advantage over those without it, I'm not okay with that. Yet somehow my wanting less in the subscription makes me greedy and my wanting to be on a level playing field with everyone else if I get the subscription makes me selfish. Impeccable logic there.
---
Ah there’s the thing, I haven’t server hopped yet so legendary enemies are rarer for me at some point it’s definitely going to get stale but for now I’m enjoying it while it lasts
---
nothing's for free boi
---
I personally love starting characters over, but either way youre gonna have to grind to change builds. I'd say stick with this toon and slowly get perks you need before moving perk points into strength, that way you still have powerful weapons and armor, but as you shift they will become less powerful. The alternative is starting over and slogging through quests and events again as a noob.
---
https://youtu.be/0EPhINLTkSs?t=55
---
Pretty much your average FO76 player
---
So, you get 1650 atoms per month from the sub, you can spend it on exclusive items, or regular items, how does it spend you more money?
---
So, my group ran into this problem last weekend when grinding for xp.  We were chatting via discord  not the game chat so we could talk even in the loading screens.  We did probably 18 matches on Saturday.  1 of them, the entire team got that message after the leader hit join a match.   And we ALL got it all at once and got booted back to the main menu. 
---
None of us left the game and the leader just re-joined a match and we went in fine.
---
Which leads me to believe that it is an errant message being used for another error. IE:  something else went wrong and its using that message for it instead of something...more accurate?
---
ALSO DONT SIT ON THE FENCE, it breaks her pathing and she won’t land if she’s targeting you
---
https://imgur.com/a/LfYvN2W
---
Could have sworn it was suppose to have green eyes
---
Ah so just a green version, thanks, I think I will pass lol.
---
Yeah that's going to be 700 atoms or part of fallout 1
---
Lol you can add an asterisk that notes that it is apocryphal.
---
I imagine plenty is free for some of the kids on this sub...
---
People who don't PvP are also doing the same thing over and over again
---
I stopped in a bush to find another player sitting in it. We looked at each other for a moment, both gave a thumb’s up, then went our separate ways. 🤣
---
You forgot Assaultron head lasers. Those FN things ruined quite a few haloween events for me, torching me down at the last second.
---
Definitely devolved
---
I think it may kick the whole team and give everyone the message when only one player on the squad has a modded file. Same thing happened to my squad the other day, turns out one of the players had not known that Beth had given us the "volume control for menu music" fix and was using a custom file to mute menu music still. (or at least that's what he told us.) it was pretty funny explaining to him that they had already fixed it.
---
It's worth it for someone that likes the color scheme. And if you don't like it then don't fucking buy it and wait for one of the other reskins already in the files or the next exclusive discount after those. Bethesda offered discounted atom shop deals, they never promised they'd fucking please everyone.
---
That's... More thin than I hoped.
---
I miss when there were fully fleshed "topics" with new stuff every week.
---
The wallpaper is really cute though. \^\^
---
The problem is, NW is just another mediocre BR game mode with Fallout skins.
---
Tbh this game is nothing without the Fallout lore and stories, and in a BR game you don't focus on those things.
---
Sad!
---
Thats what theyll all be
---
I wonder just how large or complicated you camp is.
---
Moving your camp should store everything. It's not a great solution but I don't know of a bettwr one
---
I think datamine shows that those ones from The Lonesome Road will be released.
---
Its not..open two level. But i remember hiding it so it wasnt obvious. But where i thoyght it put it..it isnt there lol
---
Eh. Kinda. Gave y'all somewhere to go blow each other to hell and back. The nerf they did was stupid but they needed to balance in some way. Unfortunately a balance sledgehammer isn't the way to go. 
---
Problem is that most people playing this are first time online players that have always had there own world. They simply don't care for the pvp part of it or other people at all for that matter. This isn't my first online but I still don't like the pvp. The games just not built for it. It barely works as a multiplayer. 
---
Personally if I want pvp I go play battlefield where everyone is there for the same thing.
---
A free wallpaper would be nice.  Something basic. Ooooh how about popcorn ceilings haha
---
What type of armor?
---
Watch some of captain noobs vids and see if there’s any new weapons you’d like, like the QE harpoon gun, that thing annihilates everything in PvE with one hit, and with 4 in the “magazine” and with flechettes you’ll never want to use anything else again
---
Oh yea theres 1 with the shoulder pads
---
Heavy Combat
---
It's worth 24 script,lol
---
Yikes, this week doesnt look all that great.
---
Well good luck finding it, or you'll have to rebuild you camp lol.
---
If that's a left arm, that's so close to my dream piece.
---
And why are shutters only available on wood wall windows? I would love to have that option on brick as well, surely that is an actual thing that wouldn't be immersion breaking?
---
hah, if I included every apocryphal/anecdotal point in my analysis it would've been 20 pages lol
---
Those tend to have more significant changes, be it vivid colours or new patterns. I can barely tell the difference between green and grey here.
---
Bethesda doesn’t like New Vegas.
---
OP is referring to a small subset of cheaters who have a thing that lets them essentially either one-shot players that are out of visual range without aiming (looks like they are just firing randomly up into the air) or just plain radiate a death field within a certain radius. It's way more obvious than an aimbot or a reveal hack. Often those same guys are either also simultaneously flying or just clipping through all the rocks and buildings as they wander around the map till everyone is dead.   
---
The aimbots and no-recoil hacks are a bit more difficult to spot/prove.
---
Eh, it's just a ploy to make you open the shop anyway. But free icons are pointless in my eyes
---
There are 2 actually
---
Spacesuits don't really have radiation resistance, not more than normal clothing TBH.
---
Wait, all dailies now give scrip? Directly in your pocket or just a crappy 1* item?
---
Is there a 2nd thought atx datamine only showed one
---
Have my upvote.
---
This was the exact content of my previous post, that got deleted for rumors.
---
But you got my point here. We do think the exact same thing unfortunately...
---
An altered version as part of Fallout 1st's money grabbing nonsense? If that's what you want more of than yeah
---
Mabey somewhere between1.5-2k caps if you are giving a 500cap per star rule of thumb for non god tier gear.
---
Not a bad piece, but i would def need in my build to spend over 1.5 on it. 
---
Dont lose anything putting it on sale and scripping later if it does not sell.
---
What limb? Believe it or not it makes a difference.
---
They give you scrip for each one you do. Forest is 3 and Cranberry big are 8, mire is 5 I think.
---
They are taking back the (1650-$12) 450 atoms they gave you! Now that's funny!
---
You whales.  This is disgusting.  Games mutated into $40 FOMO life simulators.  All of this bulls\*\*\* is here one minute, and gone the next.  Digital content doesn't actually exist, it's fake.  Smoke &amp; Mirrors.  I hope you can at least add the cost up.  Fallout was $0.03 per hour to play from 1997 up to 2018 when F76 launched.  F76 was $1.00 per hour to play for me to play, and if you played it longer than 50 hours you were hooked in precisely the way they wanted to hook you.  That's the thing.  That's the trick.  The trap.  The bait.  It works because you are just a fish to them.
---
One fish after another all stacked up.   &gt;D   &gt;D   &gt;D ....     Fishy Fishy Fishaye...
---
Never used it. I don’t know anyone who liked it. Is there a large community of survival players?
---
i wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't for the fact that it auto equips the new one.  i hate having to dig through to re equip the icon i use
---
Only way for this to work would be f you couldn’t wear armor under it, same as a rad suit
---
Oh they’ll give you the content you’ve been asking for, just as soon as your subscribe to Wastelanders Society for only $25 a month!
---
This was the attraction to whitesprings back in the day. I would love to see a cave entrance where glowing ghouls just keep spawning out in waves.
---
Ouch.
---
Morrowind on Xbox.   You would have fallen through the map a lot.
---
It was an amazing game (I’d say it still is with mods but the combat system is so restricted it doesn’t compare to latter titles in that regard...but it’s setting and story and spell making systems...well everything else is still amazing).
---
I watched an extremely boring video of a guy running around doing nothing, and what was interesting in this video was how efficiently the player was killing other players without seeing them nor interacting with them, and how nicely he was able to get through obstructions (buildings, fences, cliffs). It was ridiculous how boring it looked and how many kills he scored. One must be a really shitty being to have any fun from doing that.
---
I never tried NW because I rather PvE... but, damm... I feel sad for PvPers; had no idea the NW hacking was that absurd.
---
Yea ever since the halloween event, my ps4 has been blue screening.
---
How about walls that act as conductors or how about radiant electricity.  You could have a Tesla generator that just powers up all power points wirelessly. Also how about some solar panel roofs.
---
I really don't get the randomness of the Atom Shop the last few months. Often, there doesn't seem to be any real reason a particular item is being cycled in/out. See the Captain Cosmos costume, which would have been GREAT for Halloween. Hell, why didn't they have *all of* costumes that worked with Mischief Night available? It's chaotic and doesn't really make a lot of sense.
---
One morning a guy had his microphone on and was snoring up a storm! I tried to wake him by throwing some grenades but he slept right through it.
---
Wow nice
---
Ouch...he needs to have a backbone and refuse to spend money or enter in financially unviable agreements long term just because it’ll make her happy short term.
---
...yes I am projecting.
---
Wow what will Wastelanders surprise us with? At this point, not much will surprise me anymore...
---
Change the horde event to be a siren at random locations that goes off and has waves of enemies mobbing the location. Players must defend it because it was established by emergency services as a secret location to hide supplies for survivors of the nukes. After the defense, if successful, the cache unlocks and participants can get guaranteed loot, preferably a legendary with rare junk, without having to tag a boss, though a lvl 100 boss spawns on the final wave.
---
Do people actually call it Fallout 1st?
---
&gt; As you'd see if you read further in that conversation I had with him you'd also see we ended up agreeing.
---
Can you link to the post where u/eckserah agrees with you?
---
&gt; I never said using seeds were bad
---
How could you?  It is impossible to use a PRNG without a seed.
---
&gt; I said the way bethesda has implemented static seeds based on character/account is bad.
---
And, after all this back and forth you still haven't said *why*.
---
(Still assuming there are such things, because I've seen no evidence).
---
There will be no need for that. Obsidian and microsoft have already made it clear that TOW is the start of a new franchise. One day, we will be talking about TOW1, and TOW2, etc.
---
TOW is like the pilot episode for a new series, im looking forward to it.
---
10k for all of them?
---
And I’ve had quite a few 3* enemies at the dailies too.  Can’t believe I’ve used to ignore them.
---
how do you know the main game is making money?
---
I don’t like how I have to go digging for other free stuff lol.
---
I mean, there is nothing there I really want now I’ve got the camo underarmor but still
---
Another upvote to fix this DAY 1! bug.

Cryolater fixes these problems.

Everyone I know just wants the rewards for adventure mode. So the goal is to get as much XP as possible as quickly as possible. The best way to get xp in Nuclear Winter, for adventure players, is to hide in bushes nooks and crannies and survive as long as possible. Final combatants awards a large xp bonus. This is not a fun way to play. We call it “Nuclear Waiting”, but that’s what Bethesda forces us to do when we want these rewards. The VTU items you only needed like 2500 xp and it was a double xp week. If they would’ve ran it like that again, maybe people would play more freely. This whole 14000 xp deal puts the pressure on and takes all the fun out.
---
I mean, that is what the subscription service is called. What should I call it? 🤔
---
That's true. They did just give us a few camp objects.
---
I won't be using them until next Halloween... But I do have them.
---
I didn't have anything but 2 pirate hats drop on well over 50+ runs with 2 different toons. I have tons of pumpkin plans though. Saving for future trades. I got the pirate outfit from whitespring station vendor after someone must have sold it. Paid 4k for Jack longsuit from a player vender. I like this game a lot, but it is relentlessly unrewarding. The odds of getting rares should increase slightly each time you successfully complete an event. Having a 2.5% chance of an item,still, after hundreds of completed events, is ridiculous. Having something to actually work towards would be a breath of fresh air for this game. Complete rng is just stupid. I've done thousands of regular daily events and only gotten 2 rare regular game outfits.
---
I guess they didn't originally but, after some research the EVA suits for the Mars Mission have high radiation protection but, you're talking about a planet that has a very thin atmosphere.
---
So (genuine) question for you because I don't get the use for those. 
---
What do you use them for? General Raider terroir? 
---
They seem fairly useless imho other then minor deco unless they work well for defence purposes
---
more receipies would be awesome, like a biv scavenge/cook quest.  other than that -- pumpkin. spiced. everything (covered in gravy).
---
Mate you got an extra fiver?
---
I am not this guy but well it doesn't make sense irl so it doesn't make sense, surely looks cool in a game though.
---
Does the picket fence actually snap together or is it just a "looks good for govmint work" type?
---
I saw someone else post this but I think it makes sense. I been a lot of shop stuff was tied in to the wastelanders DLC so when that got pushed back so did everything that was tied up with it.
---
link?  for the console players who only have to deal with crashing instead of cheaters
---
And maybe toilet models that aren’t totally busted garbage? I mean, they exist in the game, so why are we scavenging trash?
---
F76 is such garbage.
---
Fallout R.I.P. (1997 - 2018)
---
I'm not losing that much, it's more annoying than anything. It happens about twice a week that 3 of the dailies are already completed. I personally never noticed any pattern when it happens.
---
I just wonder if it's happening to some challenge that had the same condition in the past from another day/week, because it has always touched dailies that I used to do because they were easy, not challenges that I never attempted.
---
If you played less then 50 hours thats your problem, I have ten times that number... No Im not a whale I bought a few things, not everything. My Fallout is 10 cents per hour
---
or even just a "internal wall"
---
Well I have a Jack o lantern short suit if you want to swap. Psn anachronisticUk
---
Except they did have content.  Both had story and side missions and activities to do for a good dozen plus hours.  What they didn't have was Destiny 1 style grind walls that made the average FtP game look forgiving.  I don't see RNG multiplier as content.
---
It’s incentive to spend your free atoms instead of sitting on $100 worth because normal atom shop stuff doesn’t appeal to you.
---
I think you are the one that's missing the point, these wallpapers looks exactly like what you'd use in the 50s, maybe they should release some basic colours for free though.
---
Thats just wrong the dog too just mean
---
The acknowledgement that F1st surpassed Bethesda's expectations in subscriptions by an "industry leaker." The sub was introduced to make the game self sufficient, that was their expectations. If it surpassed self sufficiency then it moves into profitable
---
That's part of the 'Photos 1st' add on (not to be confused with DLC) that only costs $4.99/month. I'm sure it's a great value.
---
its almost as if "giving us the cheapest possible item, which takes almost zero resources to create, instead of literally anything that people might spend money on" was their plan all along
---
I have noticed lately a lot of players still playing are heavily vested in their camps. It almost seems like a good portion of fallout is looking like a post apocalyptic version of Minecraft rather then a shooter looter or battlegrounds. I’m guessing this is because Bethesda doesn’t have a lot of competition in this market. Since they have so many models hanging around from fallout 4 improving things for this market would be well received. But they do need to add more things that aren’t behind a pay wall.
---
I want one click to equal one dead NPC. Instigating is too situational for that.
---
Try your luck at the legendary vendor,  grinding legendary enemies or buying them from other players.
---
Yes my graphic card is even older - GTX760, and I can still play at 1080p with steady fps so yes.
---
On your PC go over to [CYRI](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/fallout-76/17849) and see for yourself. The site scans your hardware and compares against system requirements of different games, letting you know if you can run them or not.
---
Everyone down voting you is a food build. You speak the truth though.
---
You perfectly explained every cell phone and cable company.
---
No way man I need a bit more than 2.5K each
---
This, also try your luck at events that can have 3 star legendaries, ie awol armorments, encryptid, arktos in the meantime.
---
More worldboses, in the same vain as scorched Queen. Don't understand how there can be only one boss in the game.
---
I used to wonder my self but the best thing you can do is always crouch to get sneak attack and you’ll start to hit harder with guns but most two handed weapons will take 2-3 hits even if it’s bloodied 
---
Do you have a nukesdragon link?
---
I personally loved the rewards for the Halloween event, but I'm an outfit hoarder and camp builder. And no, there is no way I'd spend atomic points on another color for that ranger outfit.  It's not that much of a difference it's a hard pass for me.
---
&gt;re and compares against system requirements of different games, letting you know if you ca
---
Thx for the reply but my main problem i guess is the i5 4440 :/
---
These sites are based on the requirements released by the studio, and nowadays the minimum requirements set by the studios can be very inaccurate.
---
Thx i will try
---
&gt; My request to cancel my Fallout 1st membership and request a refund have gone unanswered.
---
called it.   
---
I look forward to all of the "Bethesda charged me for a second month, even though i already cancelled" posts
---
Grind the event Leader of the Pack whenever you see it appear near Tyler County Fairgrounds in the NW corner of the map. Three packs of wolves, each pack alpha drops a low level 1* legendary weapon or armor, good at the legendary exchange machines for a total of 9-15 scrip each time you do the mission.
---
&gt;How do all of these people have awesome one hit exploding shit?
---
They have a character build and the matching weapo/gear. Most of the time it's a bloodied or fixer/junkie? build whit  a legendary weapon with such effect.
---
I think FO1st is awful, but they did say there would be Atom Shop exclusives for members. This isn’t even a little bit of a surprise.
---
At least you get to keep your armor on under the spacesuit. With the Hazmat suit you're butt naked under there!
---
When you take radaway you no longer have as many rads for radicool to work with. That's my guess anyway.
---
i totally agree with all your points!
---
Social list &gt; find their name &gt; mute
---
Do you mean the NCR ranger armor? I thought it was free
---
I just edited saying I have the same CPU, basically don't worry about it, CPU nowadays is overpowered all the time.
---
Just a thought.... but maybe something came along and destroyed it? 
---
Interface with your camp module and see if it gives you an option to restore any damaged items.
---
At 19.9% health you get the max benefit from unyielding.
---
When you take a radaway, your health goes up, lowering the uy benefits incl. a decrease in strength. That's why your max carry weight is reduced as that is dependent on strength.
---
3.5k each
---
I think that they should focus on fixing the game first
---
Everything is ok.
---
I am still at 20 or below on my health bar...I get what you are saying but there is something else involved and I am just wanting to see if there was a work around for it.
---
New vegas feels like ME1 for me, Love the universe, the setting, the history in it, but the combat is clunky, albeit passable, it's not the star of the show, but it fulfills the role in the game, I don't like bethesda, I don't like skyrim, nor 3, nor 4, I don't like the deep as a puddle "do your own story in your head" type of games that they make, but even worse is this lack of polish and thought put in the game, it makes it feel cheap and rushed and boring.
---
For the time those games were released, up until FO4, it was fine, people expected jankyness from games, they had charm and some love, from FO4 I saw no love anymore, just a cynical game, that was fallout just in name and with all the jankyness, bugs and the same mistakes since morrowind. The industry moved on, got better, learned and bethesda got stuck in the past, with Fo76 it finally bit the in the ass and they are suffering the full blow from their mistakes.
---
I personally don't believe Bethesda is capable of doing something that is not bad/mediocre, and I personally saw the dumpster fire that was 76 from a country mile, but they surpassed my expectations in that department.
---
I also know that preordering is not that great, but hey, you have the money to spend, you have limited time, you don't want to think about this stuff, but this also doesn't mean you can't be mad at the company for making a bad game and selling you lies. I don't like destiny that much, but indeed the combat there FEELS good, it feels meaty, even the Division 1 also feels very meaty and nice, Bethesda simply doesn't seem to have the talent to make something like it.
---
It must be very sad to see a franchise that you love being treated that way, I know because I also love ME3 and didn't even bother with andromeda, everybody has that show, book(hello GoT) that got shafted and you can't do shit about it, but still is sad that with so much money and resources they just can't seem to get it right, even if people are screaming in their faces.
---
Ah, also play Divinity with your kids, don't need more than one copy and it's a incredible game, albeit much more on the RPG side than fallout, and wait until someone release something like Fallout but good with online components
---
Microtransactions.   :)
---
It’s that easy? Heck, I’ll give it a try.
---
Are you serious? Of course with UY if you take radaway the +3 effects including strenght will be reduced so you can less carry.
---
I can't stand the, item cannot be placed in water butshit. Let me be creative! You, shitmunchers!
---
Wastelanders. Cause it'll be new content.
---
I just want the ability to have different colored painted walls. Why must all houses in Appalachia be red?
---
you shall understand in the future
---
It says that the I5 4440 doesnt match minimum requirements but it is still possible to play atleast on medium?
---
Okay...? Good to know.
---
Which is a weird double standard to me oj non-FtP games.  Until destiny 1 incorporated FtP mechanics to and layers of RNG grind such a thing would be DLC packs (like cod/battlefield), subscription based, or player dlc  (unreal).  That folks demand hundreds of hours on release for some games and a dozen or two for others, for the same price point is curious.
---
Had someone walking up to me underwater through the terrain as if they were a ghost trying to stick a laser rifle in my mouth. 
---
They couldn't pull it off using whatever they had to kill me - not for lack of trying either - they came back like 20 times to do so.
---
So Water? Water is the anticheat?
---
to piggyback...is there a site i can look up my motherboard and find the best cpu i can get for it?
---
Theres a skin on sale for it exclusive to 1st subs for 500 atoms.
---
"Making money" in an inversters(financial) perspective is about meeting/exceting  the expected return of investment;   
---
As we dont know how expensive F76 was to make and further what kind of return the owners/investers were expecting  - we dont really know if the game is making money in a financial perspective.
---
As for current cashflow - sure they got something from The subs. But saying that the game has to be self sufficient now  is maybe also an indication that   the owners/investers  see it as a to bad investment to risk further investement of capital.
---
Ah gotcha
---
Bright colors appeal to young minds.
---
It was, they put a skin for it for $5 that changes the color of the jacket slightly 😞
---
One shelf that would hold all the robot models, please.
---
lol - "oh you know the ones" - that singular name appearing on every name on the constant killstream every 2-5 seconds.
---
fair enough, i see plenty of people devoting their lives on farming legendaries lol 
---
i enjoy the building part a lot more, explore to gain the plans and loot while killing monsters and sometimes legendaries, and then be creative with my camp
---
The idea is for the cash shop team to provide cool assets that are thematic and sell. There's a lot of horrible stuff from the mid-20th century, that doesn't mean it should be prioritized in the game.
---
I reckon bethesda will ignore all of this like the majority of things that have been suggested since launch
---
Yeah the hidden dialogue was actually pretty cool but a lot of people missed out on it for the reasons you state. I actually think this is a pretty good side by side comparison of 3 and NV and how each excels and fails in different ways. 
---

Good point, always thought it was awkward to put those tiny thing in a massive display.
---
Find something transparent and green, hold it up to your screen, there ya go...
---
It's a 500 caps color change from drab-olive to olive near as I can tell.
---
As for the sunroom comment - the greenhouses are a thing and the new version literally does what you ask for.
---
You leave my nurgle PA skin alone! It was worth all those atoms I saved up from ~~suffering~~ playing the game...
---
Oh, thank you! :)
---
just move your camp, should appear then in "stored" then when you build new camp. I have lost items that fell thru the ground and could not see them.
---
I had one and I got it from completing the fire breather responders quest line
---
That would be super useful! I second that!
---
They should have had blood splatter wall paper last month 😔
---
Nope because you can wear armor under it.
---
Well...mint IS really good...
---
But that's exactly what Fallout is about, mocking the 50s, Communists, Democracy and stuff.
---
That being said, some cool stuff would be nice.
---
Well, it is the only good way to make pistols a viable build.
---
Well put! I understand what you're saying about the voices. I guess I just wanted to see my character in action more. It killed me that all of the companions have an awesome "special" animation,  and yet the main character always remained first person, blasting guns, or swinging weapons in ttd. And I never even thought about the NPCs having no motivation. You're so right! 
---
All in all, I really did love this experience.  I just had to voice those small complaints.. cuz I'm a spoiled gamer. 
---
At the end of the day: Good job Obsidian.
---
I understand the concept of UY and the 20% barrier...after taking a radaway I take a Toxic Goo and go back to 20% or lower and the carry weight is still at 380...It does not go back to 405  or 455 until after the radaway wears off....I am just trying to understand the affect... Something with radaway still suppresses my strength
---
Literally had some dude at the Whitesprings Station blasting Ben Shapiro into the mic while his kid was running around. Thought it was super funny until he was still there after five minutes looking  at the stash box. Best part is, I had to fast travel away to CAMP to get away from it, and it was still blasting in the loading screen while his kid was screaming. Ah the memories this game has given me, bless Fallout 76 and the people who don’t mute their mic.
---
Thx but can you play over 60 fps?
---
Oh and just a fast question does the server crash a lot? Because I live on Brazil so the connetction might be a bit slow.
---
WhT?
---
I think its safe to say that they arent going to do that until there have been at least 3 maps.
---
They will probably atleast have one in the mire, and *maybe* one in the cranberry bog too (i dont feel super sure about more than 3 however).
---
Then in true Beth fashion.  they will put them on a rotation that doesnt make sense, then never add anymore maps.
---

---
Thanks! Was this recently and do you recall what level you were at the time?
---
Try finding an Instigating weapon. Also more Strength = More Damage. If your Strength isn't at 15 it should be.
---
Incisor also gives you a nice armor penetration bonus. 
---
Martial artist increases swing speed.
---
And of course Slugger or Gladiator depending on if you prefer 1 handed or 2 handed weapons.
---
You'll be fine. It says my laptop doesn't meet minimum requirements either and I've got hundreds of hours in. Your only possible bottleneck is the slower memory speed , but otherwise it's nearly identical to the 7440 in mine.
---
Read my post...even after taking the radaway and then taking a toxic goo to get back to 20% or below my carry wight is still 380...I am trying to figure out what the side affect of the radaway is causing this
---
You guys really need to stop requesting stuff because they're just gonna make you pay for it, haha!
---
The basic idea is actually really easy. But it's still finicky when it comes to measuring the right height per item and stairs. So no matter what, there will have to be some trial and error, but yes, once you managed to get underground you can build there every bit as easily as above.
---
My recommendation would be a theremin or a banjo on the stairs. I feel like those are the easiest to place and successfully dive.
---
We did it last night and was fine. Play on a private server if you can
---
A month ago on an alt account I was around level 22
---
You can. But you may need to do medium texture and shadow (max everything elses). Those things go from chill to the sun's surface level of consumption when switch from medium to higher.
---
The '50s was not a billion homes with corny wallpaper. There were plenty of homes that were just wood, or brick, or some other natural material, as well as having wallpapers that were similar but less flashy. 
---
Plus I think you're stretching it when you try to describe these wallpapers as what 'Fallout is about'. I guarantee you when I travel the Commonwealth or Appalachia these types of wallpapers are not the norm (and when they do pop up they tend to be dirty and ripped).
---
Of course it's exclusive to F1 members. They're the only ones who have the outfit that the skin actually applies to. what good would it do non F1 members to buy a skin for an outfit they will never possess?
---
I was just thinking the same thing! A raider-themed wallpaper with bloodstains and smoke smudges would have been great in general, but especially for Halloween!
---
Thank you again! I have a bank character who has done very limited quests around the same level so this gives me an option to consider.
---
From what I've been told by others, it snaps but it doesn't sink into the ground well still
---
10mm pistol is actually quite viable imo.
---
But they should really buff all the single shot weapons in game.
---
I love story, good side missions, and choice and I can’t think of a game that has done it like outerworlds since FONV
---
Yeah those developers need to get there shit together.
---
Then you are running additional mutations, use diluted radaway instead?
---
Thx i dont care a lot about graphics I just want to have a good time with my friends
---
&gt;l be fine. It says my laptop doesn't meet minimum requirements either and I've got hundreds of hours in. 
---
Ok thx
---
I never checked, pretty sure it's lower, but your GPU is waaaay better than mine so you should be fine.
---
Thank you for the feedback on this. We've been discussing some of the thoughts that you all shared in this thread. We agree that the timing on some of these rewards could have been better, which would have given you more opportunity to rock them both leading up to and on Halloween. 
---
We have some improvements in the works for these types of challenges and rewards, and we're looking to roll out a more refined version of the system the next time we have a Nuclear Winter event like this. We'll have more details to share on that as we get closer to the next event. Thanks again!
---
Are you using bloodied 10 mm?
---
I'm just telling you what the game files say, not passing judgement. But that's a good point for people who feel blindsided by it.

---
So first, try using diluted radaway to get out of the danger zone but not wipe out half your rads.
---
Second the strength boost from unyielding is based on health, so if you aren't healing after you remove the rads then it shouldn't change. The strength from radicool is based on your radiation level, so removing rads removes strength, regardless of if you heal after or not.
---
A 10% chance to drop is also a 90% chance to get nothing.  The probability of doing it 50 times and getting nothing is 0.9\^50 = 0.005154 or close enough to 0.5% to not matter.
---
Thank you. We’re not trying to be petty or too hard on you. Just want to game to be the best it can be!!
---
I agree, but that would take away from the "photo mode poses" sales. So not likely gonna happen. Maybe have a buddy snap a pic for you with their camera.

400 atoms each. 25 to collect

There is little proof they failed, they never once claimed they weren't making money from the MTX, or that the game was not doing well financially. This isn't some indie company, bethesda is worth a few billion dollars.
---
Build and playstyle will do more for you than a good weapon. My build takes my 78 damage weapon and stacks multipliers and damage ramping perks allowing me upwards of 1,000 damage per shot.
---
I am not stretching, Fallout does exactly what I said if given any chance.
---
And your guarantee is not related, they don't have to release things that are related to the state, just general 50s stuff would do the job.
---
Talk to Beth and why they rather restrict than fix glitchbuilding.

It's +5% damage for every 5% health lost, up to +95%.

There's an entry like that for every 5% increment.

IMHO - after all the F1st controversy and them going into Vault mode:
---
It was the time to start releasing the cool things they've held back on - not hold back in the very way that their detractors call them out on.
---
Those various gun skins shown months ago that everyone pined over - now was the time to start releasing them.
---
At least One? of the growing Collectron skin variants - I sure as hell won't buy the stock one but the other's interest me. 
---
The rugs, robot models, junk stuffed animals we keep seeing occasionally in photos.
---
Instead we got a fairly empty docket - with more fomo sales and more things disappearing with yet another Ranger armor added - it's real hard to GAF about a variant of that after it's was just released.  
---
Not a good move when the dedicated have clearly showed their intention to stay and are waiting for BGS to push anything literally anything new in light of the 2020 delay.
---
I kinda know how you feel, it can be the very same for me sometimes.
---
So you say you can super easily interact with people when on Discord playing WOW. Maybe you could try doing the same for 76.
---
Don't go to complete strangers, but maybe do it more mildly. Have some of your Discord friends play 76 with you maybe.
---
It might break the ice and feel a bit more safe for you. Plus, I notice that in a lot of people, so you're definitely not alone with that. Most 76 players I personally know are not super outgoing at first and that's okay. You don't have to do the full package of greeting every stranger on your server with open arms.
---
Do things at your pace, maybe with a small group you know, and see if that's a comfortable for you..
---
So much this, aggravating to no end.
---
Why over 60 fps, I've never played with over 30 and it looks fine gtx 750ti, I don't understand this need for high fps, can you actually see some difference?
---
&gt;It's just gonna be a matter of perception to each individual. They never said there wouldn't be a paid/monthly/sub part to the service, though some people read the "there will be no paid dlc" that way. 
---
Actually Hines literally did say there would never be a season pass, which is literally a subscription....
---
&gt;there's no way to figure out exactly what effect the bloodied legendary has
---
There is - see my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drvybx/how_does_bloodied_prefix_work/f6n1lwe/).
---
I've been doing raids every day for over a month now and haven't lost any items. Neither have my teammates.
---
There are still bugs and lag is still a big issue if you're going for Expert on a public server. In this week's raid Washout, a laggy server can cause the robots in the first section to rubberband or otherwise not immediately walk to their destinations. We've found that the initial vault door not opening for everybody still happens although this is solved by having the affected person walk out and walk back in.
---
We haven't experienced the "not everybody is visible to each other in the initial cave" issue but we have a ritual to prevent that (team leader always enters first, teammates follow afterwards; after completing/failing a raid, wait for a huge lag spike to occur before re-entering Vault 94).
---
Crashes and freezes not directly related to raids can still happen in raids. These can strike at inopportune times and we have certain rituals we do to mitigate them (like restarting FO76 before attempting raids).
---
I think this is the correct answer.  Radicool's condition isn't the same as Unyielding.  Radicool is based on total Rads, and is therefore affected by RadAway.
---
Monster mash is a nice event to get legendary items.
---
people does not usually go to that event.

Bethesda is truly the worst developer in the industry.  Every game STILL has the same stupid bugs from god damned Morrowind. For such a big and well-funded dev team, it’s truly embarrassing that they keep putting out this garbage. Trash developers making fucking college-level beta-stage games and selling them as top tier blockbusters.

I have class freak at full points....Are you saying that taking a diluted radaway can still suppress mutations?  Even at that Marsupial is the only one that affects carry weight and that is only 40 pounds I believe...I am losing 75 pounds of carry weight
---
Im lvl 70 atm and need help doing main quest. Keen to team up n help other ppl out.
---
they'll also be increasing camp budget with fallout 1st, don't forget that! 🙄
---
You'd have better luck getting Bethesda to release a game with absolutely zero bugs than getting them to admit New Vegas exists.
---
Wait... on second thought, you could get them to do it if you promise to be a Fallout 1st subscriber.
---
I stopped playing because after almost a year I was still getting blue-screen or frame freeze either in adventure mode or nuclear winter, I value my time. So if Bethesda doesn't value my time then I don't see point playing it. (I do occasionally login to help friends move things here and there but that's about it.)
---
So you are saying its impossible for everyone to decide by dumb luck spawn near by and one player to get the finishing blow on all of them? Fools like you are the reason real pro players get banned and if they don't have the footage to prove they are just good they can't do nothing about it.
---
Referring to when Battlefield cheat software banned a popular player for being too good but streamed it so he was able to get unbanned but lost his ranks.
---
You're so far off the point, yet you tell me I'm the one missing the point.
---
5/6 wallpapers released so far are gaudy and/or kitsch. I'm asking them for new stuff that is more suited to the side of the game that is post-apoc and the side of the game that is retro-FUTURISM. 
---
That's called *balance*. This game does not have one single theme, as you can easily tell if you look through the non-wallpaper items.
---
You're acting like old world kitsch is the only important theme in this game and it's stupid.
---
Yup. They synergize very nicely, but they are based off different values
---
You lose the ability to put things into it, not take things out. People have already cancelled their fo1st membership and had it reverted back to non 1st and kept the box and can take stuff out, just not add anything in.
---
A pro player cannot kill the entire instance in 5 minutes 100% of the time.  So yeah, sorry bub nice try.
---
Atoms judgement for life-I-no I mean -for ATOM
---
"Pay a lot more money or we don't acknowledge New Vegas."
---
The Bethesda way.
---
Idk, maybe? I'm still sorta new to this game. What it does is do more damage after each consecutive hit
---
Of course, but y'know, you'd expect that the poll is for people that play the game
---
Oh it's not just me. Ps4 i guess. It takes days for the party to register the microphones.
---
And it's particularly bad this week ,since it's the most comm heavy raid of the three.
---
For me it's the random nature of it. IDK. Just feel a lot more comfortable with text chat, unless we're going to Discord to facilitate better communication for something we're grouping up for.
---
here u go 🔫
---
Reason they give icons is because no one wants them. Very few people will spend atoms to buy new icons on a whim when theres better items then that plus it gives them brownie points for Bethesda if they give something for free even if its useless.
---
Haven't had "Disconnected from Server" but I have crashed numerous times during the Mischief Night event...
---
Whitesprings is probably the worst place to have that event...
---
Lots of variables.
---
chems, bobbleheads, magazines, and foods can all affect weapon performance.  And some enemies are easier to kill with a particular weapon.
---
Then there's power attacks, weapon mods, legendary effects, perks, and mutations...and some armor.
---
My vampire switchblade shows 80 dmg.  If my enemy is glowing, glowsight3 perk adds something like 20% damage boost.  Lone wander adds another 10%.  If I power attack, thats ... IDK how much more.
---
IIRC, talons mutation is another dmg boost...2 of my PA parts have mods for +STR, which also increases melee dmg.
---
now I'm doing 300+ per hit.  and haven't consumed food, bobbles, or magazines.
---
Similarly, with The gutter, does 120; a power attack on a mole miner does a bit over 1000, but a power attack on a super mutant only gives about 600. 
---
Deathclaw gauntlet/3rd claw is rated at 250ish, but will one hit a L40 moleminer on a regular swing.
---
Dataminers found a pretty good one with vertical stripes lightblue and white. And the eye melting chinese wallpapers.
---
I might cry if that happens.
---
Yes! Sorry for the confusion.
---
yeah, BRUHHHthesda can kiss my money goodbye...they are going to need some good stuff to make me pay another month, but i don't see them capable to do so
---
I'm on my 4th playthrough right now still having a lot of fun. It is really fun to try different builds and team combo's, got a "captain" build that is all speech and buffing companions, solo sniper, melee bruiser, sneaky thief that specializes in inflicting status effects with corrosive weapons and TTD shots.
---
Not to mention I haven't even started adding in any of the mods yet.
---
Yeah, in sheer numbers.  They aren't too bad when you know where to expect them, like around Watoga or in the nuclear silos.  Although I still think it's a bug that they don't have to charge up that beam like they do in Fallout 4 - even the Imposter Sheepsquatch has a noticeable charge.
---
You mean the tents? It’s just the tent and what it comes with. There is not a build area
---
Didn’t know this either
---
It’s roughly as big as a 2x1 platform for reference
---
I wanna say about as big as the Big Tent you can build at your CAMP
---
Example - when I'm not playing around with other weapons, my main is a Vampiric Explosive double barrel, and I'm running Shotgunner, Expert Shotgunner, Scattershot, Skeet Shooter, and Enforcer, all at rank 3.
---
You gotta figure out what one or two things you want to do well and gear towards those things only.
---
I got a ton of duplicate rewards. Like every time. And the last run I was rewarded more duplicates and a golf ball. A fucking *golf ball*.
---
Are you on PC? Ill do it with yall on my private world if you want.
---
No, I used an automatic AAE 10mm before, just for fun.
---
Some single shot pistols perform pretty well in stealth too.
---
This \^\^
---
After all we are playing Fortnite76, it's those younger players who must be spending heavily in the Atom store. The way the majority of players seem to be constantly dressed in non post apocalypse appropriate attire and jump, sprint and bounce about all the time it really does seem like the Fornite I sometimes watch on Twitch until my eyes start to bleed and I hit the off button on the computer.
---
Biggggg oof
---
The game renders at the same exact internal resolution regardless of what resolution the display output is set to. Changing the resolution in the display settings does not at all change what resolution the game renders at. 
---
Don't peddle false hope of improving performance when you don’t understand the fundamentals of how Xbox One/Xbox One S/Xbox One X renders games. 
---
You will NOT see improved performance on Xbox One by changing the display output resolution. I highly suggest you check out Digital Foundry breakdowns of both the Xbox One X and Fallout 76. They do a good job explaining things.
---
Christ...just let me have plain ass wall....painted whatever color I want.
---
Ok, I can see that, is there anything special about it or is it merely a fast travel tent?
---
Gotcha
---
Yea, I wasn't sure what to call them lol
---
I think you Will get a free skin each month but have to pay for reskins
---
has a sleeping bag, cooking stove, banjo, STASH, and the scrap box I believe...
---
FISHING.
---
Yep. It is so horribad on PC! There are a ton of YouTube videos out there with proof of people hacking (mostly on PC) and nothing is being done.
---
Maybe instead of being snarky, ask the question of how much needs to be picked up or in the event you HAVE that information, maybe instead add value by giving the details rather than... i don't know... what you posted.
---
Btw when baro
---
I want it to have more love, too, but I do also feel like the way they reload has different strengths. For a full reload single action takes longer, but you can also load only a single bullet and that can go pretty far when it comes to saving your bacon with a crit.
---
On private servers I have not been able to get everything to respawn after killing everyting in the area.
---
One of them is a masterpeace of game making from a beloved studio and the other is fallout 76 from bugthesda.
---
Having never done Monster Mash, are there just a lot of high-level legendary enemies there?
---
It's rad-x that suppresses mutations, so this is not the reason why.
---
Not OP but I like to use the tires to make scrappy looking walls around my camp. They work well to break up the other various items I use, like the military barricade, concrete barricades, regular fences, guard posts, and Free States truck beds.
---
Wallpapers ... I can see Bethesda offering a wallpaper that is essentially an ad for the atom shop or 1st....
---
It's pretty good on private servers but it's still boring an not rewarding at all. No idea why people waste time with it
---
They already technically did increase stash space, with the scrap box.  It does suck they're going to paywall increased camp budgets too.  I'm not surprised though.
---
I wish that they allowed dual welding of pistols.
---
When you try to place it, it does throw down a green circle that seems to be the same size as the camp area (I think), so you do have to watch for conflicts, and sometimes the tent can’t be placed.
---
WOW increased C.A.M.P. budget is behind a paywall. Glad we are finally going the F2P route.
---
I know I played the game for a little bit with an i5 750 and an RX 570 for a bit and got mostly 60 with lowered settings, so it should be fine
---
&gt;Why over 60 fps, I've never played with over 30 and it looks fine gtx 750ti, I don't understand this need for high fps, can you actually see some difference?
---
Of course XD
---
What motherboard do you have?
---
This is amazing for collectors, thank you so much!
---
Be that as it may it's still inexcusable for the 250 dr while reloading bug to have lasted this long.
---
I either have a 660 or 760 and play just fine as well, even new games like AC Odyssey.
---
Hoping Ol' reliable can get me onto rdr2 this evening after work, fingers crossed.
---
Dude, just put some thought into it and the most retro futuristic wall paper you can get could be a dumb space ship wallpaper like those you complaint able lmao. 
---
The game has different themes, yes, but you have to know it's RETRO-FUTURISTIC, not retro-FUTURISTIC. Those things will always look like 50s old world kitsch just with a different image lmao.
---
On ps4 and getting blue screen of death a lot recently
---
I've been really turned off the game lately, but if you send me a reminder I'd be happy to log in and check my characters...I'm pretty sure I have one that you are more than welcome to.
---
tag is UCGSQUAWK on xbox
---
What’s the free raider thing?
---
You don't need to defend this, Bethesda won't/can't do anything about it so you are safe and can continue.
---
I forget what it's called, but there's a nice looking white 2 level shelf. When I got the plan, I was thinking about how great it would be to display something on, then I thought, 'wow, those robot models would be great on that thing!'. Well, I got my disappointment fix that day when I realized that the shelf was completely useless after I built it with my robot models queued up to go into it.
---
That's another thing, removing all of your junk will basically take away 300-400 lbs in an instant. But they tell us stuff like increasing these things would mess with the servers' stability.
---
They should put it in the camp personal terminal
---
Some people claim it makes a difference. Personally, I've watched side by side videos of games at 30 and 60 fps and cant see a difference.
---
I wonder if you could throw down some turrets?
---
I'd have to look when I got home...
---
Yeah, it kinda sucks honestly. This game had so much potential.
---
Why would they be free. You go on other games sub reddit and complain about buying skins too?
---
You on xbox?
---
His rack is emtpyyyy
---
sure - like so many other things in this game :)
---
Fair enough. Know you could just look it up on the manufacturers website, and usually they have a compatibility list
---
Bethesda: oh clearly them 30 players are just standing next to each letting this player kill them all!
---
While thats true, you can still mess around. https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/6696wp/hackers_on_ps4/
---
That sucks that happened to that guy, but that’s just not the case here. People getting rapid kills from across the map is incredibly common on pc since the launch of NW with plenty of footage documentation and it has been a huge topic on this sub that gets Bethesda replies all the time and they never comment on this issue.
---
\#unpopularopinion
---
:) made me laugh, upvote
---
I saw it mentioned that technically scrap doesn't matter because it's on item with an arbitrary number next to it.  So it doesn't take up really anything resource wise, as opposed to weapons and armor.  Having said that, that begs the question of why pay wall it then?
---
😂👍
---
Lol the best was the stupid golf outfit! That pissed me off everytime!
---
It' s not that bad...even a mediocre player can clear 200-300 a match...get good at hiding and you're into the 500+ realm
---
The Void Trader is scheduled to arrive in
---
 02D 16h 53m 12s 
---
Yeah, I specced the last dudes I saw doing it (there were two on a team). It looked boring as hell. Turns the game into a freaking outdoor walking sim I guess. The worst part were their other two hapless (non-hacker) teammates, all dressed for a fight, no kills, wandering around wondering where all the other players went.
---
Yea, I kinda feel like the minimum requirements set by the studios nowadays sometimes could be waaaay higher than the actual requirements since they are trying to play the safe card.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWP2TZ2Lfw
---
PS4, but thanks for the offer!
---
Obsidian made nv tho. Bethesda's alone will.never compete with Obsidian.
---
You need to learn to love the bush.
---
Exactly, there's no reason to paywall things like that. And this is just allowing them to go further down this path and do worse.
---
I'm not sure this is true. I've done those fights where she's on me, her sonic blasts targeted directly at me, while on V9 and she lands outside the fence. It might happen occasionally, but it's not reliable enough to confirm, imo.
---
It's a bit of a joke really. Green looking coat. It's literally the same; just a change in colour
---
Someone correct me if I’m wrong. Under the ATOMIC SALES section, a section where one would expect the items to be on sale, the vault tec stairs are still 500. So is the ‘sale’ there running just the another free icon that they give out.
---
Yeah I thought that was pretty well understood...
---
Ah, that's a real shame. I'm pretty sad that the way people experience the game will begin to diverge even further depending upon whether or not they have the means or inclination to subscribe. But I totally get why people subscribe, and I'll be interested to see what people do with that extra budget. I'm sure we'll see some really creative projects (and also a bunch of sparsely decorated supermassive floating camps!).
---
Oh agreed. And they turned it around. We were getting updates, good content, had an excellent DLC coming out and then BAM this. Right in the nads.
---
They probably also don't like that I bought Fallout 1st, but down voting legitimate information because I'm one of many who chose to do so will only hurt the community overall. And I'll still find them hiding in their bushes.
---
No sir just what comes with it.
---
Thank you for the silver kind sir or madam!
---
DUH!
---
this is the correct answer.  If there was an outfit option that grants the rr and rad reduction of hazmat but also allows armor, there's no reason to ever use pa for anything other than maybe the stabilized perk.  
---
That said if they changed the space suit to work like a hazmat suit so it unequips armor when you put it on and putting on armor unequips the spacesuit then sure.  This would at least give people a style choice when going into a nuke zone :P
---
Well, we haven't explored any of the vaults yet, so that's exciting in and of itself to us. We like exploring.
---
It is just a cosmetic outfit you can wear armor under, that's why it won't get rad resistance. The hazmat suit doesn't let you wear armor. It's meant to enforce the compromise between armor and rad resistance.
---
buddy of mine says he'll give me his old card for a song once he upgrades. I think what helps me is i don't try to squeeze out every ounce of power from my machine, I play to play, not to make a fake tree look 100% like a real tree
---
It was under my assumption the skins would've been free, especially after all the Halloween cosmetics that came out. I actually assumed this skin would be a reward for month-2 if you kept subscribed. I think its alittle scummy they did it halfway through the pay period
---
Rough my arse.  Bethesda don't care about PR or what you want.  They care about money.  Take the rose-coloured glasses off mate, life will appear in a whole new light.
---
Well, fallout 3 was my very first rpg, and i spent more hours than I should have on it. So for me, Bethesda still has alittle piece of my heart because of that. Alot of memories from that game. I'm not saying like, I completely love them. But I love them to an extent. Kinda like that weird friend you have but he's still a friend.
---
Agreed. But you should still be required to aim your shots manually. If you can't manually land your shots against a strafing target, you shouldn't win the fight just because you have a meta build. 
---
That's one of the biggest gripes I have with the game when I PvP. "Oh that guy has a meta build and I don't, I have literally no chance against him even though I'm significantly better at fps games."
---
We knew this two weeks ago..
---
Well farming West Tek is already a very reliable way to get steel and caps.
---
Did you forget you get 1650 atoms each month the membership???  How do you figure everything is free after you sign up for Fallout 1st?
---
gotta save those bytes, right?
---
Jesus. I have to work on my build I guess I’ve been focusing on moving points all around to boost my nuclear winter player. I wish it was separate
---
I am glad to see you gave an accuracy penalty.  I'd guess you fired large bore in each hand IRL :)
---
Paid outfits or paid timesavers? cause that seems to be our only choice in the matter unfortunately. I personally would rather paid outfits.. but if Bethesda releases these cosmetics later to non subscribers, chances are it’ll cost them more than what subscribers are paying for it
---
I suppose yeah, but since I'd say a good chunk of the community is already hovering at 30k caps (or more) ... yeah I dunno. Still seems wildly pointless. At this point I go to WS and buy some plan just to knock me back down so my vendor caps don't go to a black hole.
---
Update LadyDevann just commented in my repost of this thread on the official boards... [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370539/it-is-impossible-to-roll-unyielding-for-solar-or-thorn-armor/42?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=3](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370539/it-is-impossible-to-roll-unyielding-for-solar-or-thorn-armor/42?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=3)

&gt;@Raknorok said:

another week and still no response.  I've stopped doing this  content all together,  what's the point of trying if my unyielding gear  out performs vault armor in almost every way.   
---
@Community-Manager is the inability to roll for unyielding on vault armor an oversight or intentional?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Checking in on this one!
---
Haha, those floater camps are just awful. xD
---
I feel the same way, dividing the community it's ideal. It's just that given the game's general performance stability-wise, increasing the camp budget significantly was likely never gonna happen.
---
That said, I'm hoping Bethesda will figure out a way to bridge private worlds. Just because we have a lower server cap doesn't mean we have to completely isolate those servers. I'd love to see something like a new UI that can be accessed if you're a subscriber, which shows a listing of private worlds set to 'open' by the owner. Basically a lobby page. That way we could just run around casually visiting other worlds without the logistics of having to join a forum, make friends, put them on your list, etc.
---
It’s not perfect but it’s still fuuuuuuun! And most people are very nice in my experience.
---
Awesome, thanks for the answer!
---
It is but I'd think duping cleavers and scrapping them (especially if it works with scrapper which I'm unsure of) would be an easier/faster way if you want a ton of steel and wood quickly. And selling junk is way easier than hauling guns to a vendor to sell.
---
I sold my extra pumpkin short suit for 6k.
---
Yet...
---
Going to try this out. Thanks!
---
I'll look into it. I used to play cod religiously but it went down hill after BO1 and MW3. I just can't stand aim assist in competitive games on console. It narrows the skill gap so everyone feels like they're good :/
---
I did the event probably at least 6-8 times per day, every day of the event and I got 3 outfits, Pumpkin Pant Suit, Pirate Costume and Whitespring Jumpsuit. I don't think I even got all the Jack O Lantern plans. SOOO many golf outfits, clown hats and spacesuit helmets though.
---
You're welcome man! I was seeing people talk about bugs so I tested it myself. It's hard these days if things are still bugged or not.
---
Fallout 1st would have been cheaper!
---
Then why didnt you tell me?
---
Ok, I'll stick with 3 then, thank you!
---
It’s for ammo. No one in their right mind would sell it to a vendor.
---
1, Read the other comments, it's been covered. 2, I never said "EVERYTHING SOULD BE FREE" you smartass bitch.
---
It’s not $5. It’s 500 atoms. Swing as subscribers get 19,800 atoms for $100 that’s around 50¢ / atom. So $2.50. But that is not even counting the other things they get for free. Either way, at most it is $2.50 but realistically it costs way less.
---
Enjoy being poor.
---
That doesn't justify putting it on reddit.
---
Well all I care is the general textures and the shadows.
---
With my custom ini settings currently I can have medium textures and low-med shadows which at least doesn't look like something out of minecraft.
---
Can’t be destroyed either.
---
Bethesda told you when they said 1st members would have access to purchase exclusive cosmetics from the shop..
---
Nice
---
this was a thing pre fo1st, its been since meat week. this is nothing new, and definitely not a 1st specific problem
---
My apologies, my comment was rude.
---
Wishful thinking lol
---
So they did an exploit, got caught doing it, and they're butthurt and quitting now? LOL. Typical.
---
So being able to join friends worlds is broken?
---
as a non first member, he does not speak for me
---
Depends on your expectations. There are lots of us who still find fun in the game. There's a really rich Fallout world under the multiplayer veneer, one of the best depending on who you ask. But like any Bethesda game, it's still full of bugs and like any game as a service, it's full of monetization.
---
IMHO, if you can find it on sale, it's well worth it. Even if you just play solo and explore, it's a really neat world with lots of lore. But don't hide from the multiplayer aspect either, the community has really made Fallout 76 way more fun than it would be otherwise.
---
Again, you get 1650 atoms each month as part of your membership and that will easily cover the 500 atoms for the skin.  If you spent your atoms already, just wait a couple weeks when your membership renews and you'll get another 1650 atoms and then apply 500 of those towards the skin.  Pretty simple economics.
---
Or translation: "We were caught exploiting, and got banned, and now we made up a story about how we were just "verifying" it."
---
It's the same. 
---
I'm always happy to see multiple squads all drop in close proximity of one another because I know only one of them is walking away, and they might not even be intact when they do. I spawn in a quiet area where I can reliably get good gear and a few easy kills. let the the big boys sort each other out.
---
Glad to see the backwoods bungalow on sale at least
---
Your going to find looted locations on either instance, public or private, due to the nature of how loot respawns. 
---
Can't speak for dead bodies etc, don't have access to private, but I feel if it were actually true there would be a way bigger stink over it.
---
Oh sweet. Thank you
---
I wouldn't say it's a good Fallout game, but it's an enjoyable game.
---
I played NW when it first launched and had a bit of fun but dropped it like i pretty much dropped the whole game bc I knew it was going to come to this lol.
---
FYI she cant hear you but he can.  You can totally change the course of their relationship with a few well placed words.  Very few times in life are you gifted the power to play God in other peoples relationships.  Treat yourself.
---
Edit: It's a joke yah dingalings 🤣
---
congrats on your pulls! if you ever want to sell that pirate outfit, keep me in mind!
---
Someone bought one of my higher priced legendaries last night, pushing me to 30000. I was at a vendor and bought a bunch of crap I didn’t need before he bought something else. That’s some sweaty palms moments!
---
Yeah it’s pretty pointless, you kill mutants to grind for gear, then when you get that gear what do you use it for? To kill more mutants of course! It’s grinding for stuff so you can grind for more stuff, but for some I enjoy the grind.
---
Nahh i am not dumb enough to fire akimbo in real life;p
---
I am missing the Practice Jack O'Lantern plan. Please send help ha. I'll pay 1.5K.
---
save file editing=/=hacking
---
Might as well stay in private than. The game could barely take a few Halloween decorations in white springs. Probably have bad frame rates walking up on one of these camps.
---
Why would you assume the skins are free? They never said that or hinted at it
---
Worked for me, got a new bed for the bungalow.
---
They changed it. Went to join my friends private yesterday and suddenly could not due to not having been invited.
---
That sounds great. I sure would love for Obsidian to get another crack at a Fallout game as well though.
---
Pretty sure I have one if you are on PS4.
---
I get the sentiment but it becomes challenging with this kind of entertainment.
---
People get so much more invested in these worlds and IPs so when they get fucked with its almost like they're being held hostage by thier creators.
---
Plus core audiences are usually what pulls more and more people in, so it always feels like a slap in the face when publishers or devs do something slimy.
---
Wow I’ve been playing since beta and haven’t noticed that. Thanks for the info. I love the stairs but hate the price.
---
I have used it and it does indeed snap together.  You just got to ensure there are no changes in the terrain or you are screwed but you can still try to manually place the pieces in if possible.
---
Gov'ment cheese not included
---
Plenty of those popular players that pull of that shit are actually using cheats even while streaming.  Plenty of hacks do not make you instant god mode but just give you small advantages, and or overlays that are not captured by streams.
---
I honestly feel bad for pc players. NW is so fun to play. This should be BGS top priority right now.
---
I've been in fights where everyone's on the roof at v9 and she's still landed
---
 The point of the mission is to wear a clown mask to attain the most candy (points), when you pick up a total of 5K of candy you can get a 1 star random legendary item from the vendor machine inside the institute. But the best thing of the event is that there are 3 rounds, each of them will longer 5 minutes and infinite groups of feral gouls will spawn, they can spawn as legendary enemies and i think they are always a 3 stars legendary. Sometimes i get just 1 legendary item and other times i get 2 or maybe 4, depends of how many legendary enemies will spawn obviously. If you are super fast you can collet 1.2k of candy every time you do this event
---
Sorry for my english if something is not very clear or its write incorrectly!
---
I got an extra xb1
---
Thanks :)
---
As for the 19.9, I always say that because at that point Nerd Rage will trigger 100% of the time.
---
Yeah it is the same approach, but in a game that's main focus is to "rebuild" and constantly adding things to the atomic shop it'll make those players feel like they **need** to buy fallout 1st just to continue to use everything they've purchased from the atomic shop already. Your camp is an essential part of game play honestly, it's where you probably spend 60% of your game time because you're managing your stash (unless you have fallout 1st then this isn't really a problem), repairing things, putting some items away or even decorating. They shouldn't remove things they've been patching into the game already to make it better and put it behind a paywall.
---
I loved the last few updates to the Atom shop!
---
more often then i like to admit...some songs i have to mute myself though....lol
---
Why dont you wear armor out of curiosity?
---
Most of the people you're thinking of are using keyboard &amp; mouse.  Mouse precision is crazy efficient.
---
What should I do if I’m not planning on using VATS I know they’re powerful I just don’t like using them
---
But yet eso does the same things and nobody complains about that like they do here.
---
No I doint
---
Every time I get that buzzing it crashes to home within about 30 seconds. 
---
I tried to play on the weekend but it took 3 attempts before I could get the game to load, got about 30 minutes of play then it crashed...at that point I found another game to play.
---
I’m a first subscriber too. And I like it. It’s very simple why I like it—it makes my game play more fun. I play fallout a lot. I have a few friends I play with and while I have also played outer worlds, it lacks two things I love about 76. My friends and the camp building stuff. Are there things I wish Bethesda would do to improve things? Yes. I also recognize to do these improvements they really need a subscriber based system. They can not support this game off of atom shop alone. I think it’s great though they have found away to provide both subscription service and free to play service.
---
You realize that people were duping meat cleavers, mines - really anything throwable - well before Fallout 1st, right?
---
Ok so it’s not worth trying to get them back?
---
Bethy shouldn't put stuff behind paywalls like this, people shouldn't support this.
---
Paging Dr. Evil. Price check in aisle two.
---
Bad luck mate.....
---
Keep trying   Go two in a rowI was hunting last night.
---
One was actually on a server jump I got lucky on.
---
Good feedback, and Divinity is on my "to play" list. Note that Doom, another Bethesda title, has the "meaty" weapon and melee feel. It was because of this that I suggested that it was less a matter of skill, and more a matter of investment/priority. In either case, it's a shortcoming that makes the games noticeably inferior and difficult to excuse. The OP was talking about this being a AAA title, and it's hard to argue that there are more glitchy games, a year after release.
---
ME: Andromeda is terrible, but they addressed the deal-breakers before abandoning future updates. FO76 continues to blow off many deal-breakers because, I have to guess, they feel they will always have time to do it later...
---
I am a die hard fan that has no issue paying for these things
---
im not the only one, i do this too sometimes. my husband or kids will come in and see my screen ... "are you naked???"
---
Ugh this is another reason why I won’t play NW after I get the Halloween stuff
---
ESO is an MMO with 12x as much content as Fallout 76...It still confuses me why people compare those two. That's like comparing Mario Kart to Dark Souls.
---
Being factual is civil, I'm not trying to degrade you, just pointing something out.
---
i love you forever.
---
If it's the big nosed fasnacht man mask, that's available in the base game.
---
You should probably clarify that you are making a joke before a squad of Fallout 76 haters come along, see the words “Fo76” and “Polished” in the same sentence, and immediately downvote.
---
My hopes here as well. I really want this game to see the same kind of growth.
---
If ur asking this, an explanation wont help you.
---
So lame, I won’t play again...until the rewards come out...lol
---
That only proves that duping is not limited to normal players, nothing else.
---
You saying this is like me saying that all PS owners are morons, just because you posted this.
---
I had a grown ass man in my ear the other night arguing with his mother about whether or not he got his shift covered. It was not pleasant.
---
Yes sir, spread the work! SAVE THE ATOMS!!
---
Too bad all the helmets basically belong to the NCR Vetaran Ranger Armor. In New Vegas Riot, Advanced and Elite all had different looking helmets...
---
Ah okay. So you don’t have an answer. Figured.
---
0 faith in thier ability to deliver a great rpg again. They've gone super accessible and I think that's ended up alienating alot of the people who like thier older games to begin with.
---
Myself included.
---
I really REALLY miss it. Survival Mode enhanced all of the other parts of the game for me. It's just not the same in adventure mode. Haven't been playing since it was taken away.
---
&gt; This was an expensive game to make, no doubt
---
It was probably as expensive as Metal Gear Survive.
---
&gt; it costs money to make small QOL improvements for the community, who for the most part seems very ungrateful and angry.
---
Metal Gear Survive STILL gets updates...
---
&gt; I don't like it when parts of the game, or features, are denied to me, so I'll pay to have them back, and if bethesda want to charge me more for DLC in the future which isn't included in that Fo1st subscription, well then I'm fine with that.
---
Paid for the full game, expect the full game. You didn't get a full game, so until you do, you shouldn't be willing to throw more money at Bethesda.
---
I think that giving them enough time to prove themselves as a developer and publisher is an honorable thing to do, so I say thanks for that. They're trying something new here with Fallout, and I'm happy to give them extra money to help them in finding out how to make the game work better.
---
It can't be easy to make this kind of game, and it's not their fault if there are unforeseen challenges which need fixing later down the line.
---
There is a term for people like you, for a very good reason. "Whale"; "CashCow"; etc etc. Those words aren't just internet insults, they are actually used to describe brainwashed business models and costumers in a  ecological scientific way. And companies like beth,  hire people who actually abuse that and force people like you to buy into their cookie cutted Advertisement. Look those terms up and ask  yourself if you are fit into that descriptions. You shouldn't be tooooo proud of that to spend money on a cash grab, because sometimes it always will backlash on you in some way. Even the tiniest sign of addiction is the result of it. Of Course don't take my words that seriously. Its your money and its your life, i dont give a fuck about that, BUT if you put such posts on the internet think about it next time how are you going to influence other people with that \^\^! Even children are going to read this and think this is the best way to handle their money, which is definitely not. Moral Apostle Out; cheerio
---
It just occurred to me. If you start a new character, do you still have access to everything you've unlocked in the Atomic Shop? If so, does completing challenges in the new character get you the same amount of points? Or is it reduced?
---
The title could literally apply to every single thing in the game.
---
Friend of mine saw this and he got a kick out of it and told me, I don't use Reddit too often anymore. 
---
Add hottkarls on psn and I'll be glad to take a few pics.  I got fallout on day 1 and despite being excited to play I spent a good 45 minutes on getting him as handsome as possible.  Early on people would ask for pictures all the time but less so recently.
---
I'll be on in about 1 hour. My GT is Penguinistics
---
But First We need Dinky the Dinosaur
---
Well I don't like being lied to and I don't like supporting shitty business practices
---
You do know Monsters Hunter World is not even remotely as massive as they can't have that much players in a game? 
---
And they are selling DLC while you are getting a free DLC called Wastelander in Fallout 76? 
---
And you do know you can mod this game now similar to MHW as well, for free? Official mod support should be like something you'd get in Creation Club.
---
yeah. I ran it on med low with a 1050ti at 50-60
---
Game mechanics wise and how you interact with the world as well as how they tell their stories OW is very similar to pre fallout 76 games.
---
Jesus, could you be more of a payed shill?
---
They came up with a subscription to squeeze more money out before even fixing much of the problems with the game (I'm on Xbox, I don't know about anyone else but it is pretty much unplayable now due to crashes) - are you really surprised that they would continue to be trying to milk everyone for more?
---
At least you get free atoms each month to spend, that should be something. Some of us are left with a game that can't be played for more than a few minutes at a time without it crashing.
---
wait, as he runs places ppl just die?  he doesn't even have to shoot?
---
Removes rads without the side effects of a radaway. Good for leveling with mutations until you can get starched genes as it won't remove them
---
Yes exactly! Also, a lot of the items you could buy with atoms were often on crazy deals which couldn't have been making them much cash, at the least the subscription model guarantees them an income, even if they didn't manage to out anything out in the atom store that month, we're still supporting them to make the game even better!
---
Yes, the special part about it is that you will never be over encumbered again.
---
60%? For me it's more like 5%. I only go to my camp if I want to refill my vending machine with new ammo. If I want to craft, repair or stash stuff, I have all I need at the white springs station and outside the mine next to it. Or I use other ppls camps if I shop around.
---
I'd say you are just too generous lmao.
---
Yeah it sucks. Thought I’d get some extra NW in. Instead, I get screwed. And the the match DC’s 🤦‍♂️
---
If someone is spending more then $10/month on a game I’m not sure I would classify them as casual player. I’m thinking they would be classified as die hard fans. Especially if this is like the one game or maybe one of a few games they play.
---
They just need to increase point rewards for kills. Problem solved. Right now NW is just  a big game of hide and go seek with guns. ( That sentence makes it sound better than it is!)
---
I never knew that...I do now though!
---
thanks, we appreciate it
---
True. I'm not happy with the way things have become. I remember when skins were first introduced to games years ago and I thought it was so silly.  
---
I'm a FO1st subscriber and up until that I would purchase atoms occasionally. I also enjoy getting season passes from time to time on Rocket League and Apex. I tend to only play a couple games for long periods of time so it works well for me.
---
We learned our lesson for good
---
But there's much more to the game than just around the White Springs area.
---
I understand your point, but if I'm a Fo1st sub, and you aren't, then isn't fair to say that you're not experiencing the full game? If I wasn't subbing then how I would I even know what I'm missing out on in terms of features and gameplay experience?
---
It’s cross platform and as of right now there seems to be little to no skill gap between pc players and console players. This cod is a lot different from all the rest and that’s for the good. So yeah check it out!
---
should do, yes.
---
One issue I have had the 2 times I've tried this raid is that once a teammate is down I haven't been able to revive them. I walk up to the downed player and don't even have the option to revive them... And yes I had stimpaks and liquor (quack doc perk)  
---
Anyone else ever experience this \[PS4\]
---
thank you
---
Except not. 1st isn't paid dlc. A season pass is to get paid dlc.
---
I only read your title, but yes that has to be a thing, especially when private server becomes more of a thing.
---
Could be nice having some placeable food. I'd even suggest another food giveaway item (centerpiece turkey) but with food spoilage as it is, the thing would probably only give out cram, beans, etc
---
I can go to west tek and get 600+ steel per run that takes about 7mins each, not to mention all the xp from kills and possible legendary drops. Let those idiots sit there with all their meat cleavers lol.
---
I like blending in and I usually don’t get too many boxes. I have a all brown outfit that really blends in most places. Camo and all defensive perks are the most important to me. Hide if not escape. I play solo so I don’t have a chance with teams except when they weaken at the end around where I start wearing armor. Any sort of engagement before that has a good chance for me dying unless I can escape.
---
It's not  Edit: I apologize; it looks like duping is acceptable around here if you are a Fallout 1st member! Nothing to see here, people.  It's the fact you instantly blame  Fallout 1st member  for being the ones that dupe with your title " **Fallout 1st members are duping meat cleavers"** You clearly don't play the game often or you would know about the duping!
---
Yeah it's an area of effect radiation thing.
---
Because being optimistic about Bethesda and it’s game is so worth it, right.. right???
---
I wouldn't mind buying DLC zones like on ESO, what i hate is anything that requires weekly/monthly/yearly payments. That sucks, if I pay for something I want to enjoy it till I fucking die, not just while I keep feeding money to a company wich stated that they wouldn't milk my money but in the end is the only thing they want.
---
I respect your chice but honestly I have to say that IMHO you're wrong. Game was advertised as pay once-&gt;enjoy.  Obviously, each day is getting farther from that idea and closer to any other half-free MMO out there. Sad, but true.
---
Get a few more shifts at Popeyes.  You'll be ok
---
We found the bethesda dev/employee
---
Our discord kills thousands of SBQ weekly. It does prevent her from landing consistently.
---
That really isn't too bad, since shotgun perks are in str. You can easily get the 12 or so levels needed for the perk cards, much faster than getting to 61+ all over again.
---
Lack of working end game content sent me on my way. The vault raids are still too broken to complete reliably. For sone people ive talked to, they just flat out still cant get through them.
---
Fair enough!
---
Well I never said why I think others should do it, I just said why I'm doing it. 
---
I'm only doing it because I feel it's what is truly the right thing for me to do as a player of the game. I get to play the game bethesda made, and in return I'll support them with money. You don't have to spend all that money id you don't want to, but if you don't, you're missing out on features and personally I just can't stand that. I only have about 2 or 3 games on the go at any one time, and when one of them (76) started asking more and more from me I got really sad and frustrated at first, but then I realised I just had to bite the bullet and invest if I wanted full access to the product.
---
Noted!
---
I detect a sleet pun...
---
Plan on using mutations?
---
You could always move some points into being able to take class freak and starched genes.
---
HAHAHAHA. Exact same dude.
---
Lost all my dailies yesterday. Do you just have to log in adventure any time? I was under the impression you need to be IN adventure when the daily switches over.( Today that was 10am eastern, an hour earlier than normal, WTF?)
---
I'm sorry but that's stupid. **"I don't like it when parts of the game, or features, are denied to me, so I'll pay to have them back"** 
---
This only supports company's to make half-baked games and selling them for ridiculous prices, as well as adding microtranstions and loot boxes. On top of squeezing as much money from players and giving back very little "content" 
---
A Triple-A game company shouldn't have to rely on pity money from its player base.
---
Bethesda please!
---
But with that stupid timing, can you still explore? Basically you are just rushing through it isn't it?
---
I'm in the UK so tend to hear lots of Europeans falling out..Italian domestics are the best ones!
---
I don't want to make a fool out of myself.
---
had I held off due to what I read here, I would have returned the game unopened.
---
But 11 months and 700 hours later, I'm still engaged and enjoy playing.
---
This forum is often negative, so you might want to hop over to /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
different mindset over there.
---
I think they were just surprised at the scale of supporting the thing they created, which is why they've asked for more from us to help them.
---
Then what is even the point of running a fallout76 sub, and then what are you even doing on one?
---
Fuck, this community has grown toxic.
---
Thats people these days. If you dangle something, anything (even if its junk) in front of them; then they *have* to have it. They will do anything (even if they hate it), just to get the junk. Of course, then they will complain how they were "made" to do it. Its compulsive, they cant help it.
---
I didn’t have any issues with mischief night luckily. Not sure if I should uninstall the game or wait and see if it gets better. I haven’t been able to play the game for more than about 10 minutes before the server stops responding.
---
Wow I really do pity you. Not just because you'll blindly spend the maximum amount with no sense of what value for money is attached to it but you don't even have the conviction to stand by this under your own account.
---
I hope a therapist is able to help you through whatever this is. I really do. This doesn't sound like the action of a rational person.
---
And here I am ,trying to sell my assassins handmade for 2k. Is this too much?
---
Any new social tool os good, we need so many
---
Snow globe 1500 atoms
---
Riot gear combat armor Christmas skin 1800 atoms
---
Power armor Christmas skin 1800 atoms
---
Christmas tree 800 atoms
---
Christmas decorations 100 atoms
---
Vault boy santa icon Free 
---
That's all folk pls Bethesda thanks
---
lol I rest my case.
---
Agree the fact it was at the whitespring affected the stability of the event but honestly where else would have worked on that scale?  Watoga maybe?
---
So no Fallout 1st members are duping, then?
---
Also I guess I should explain that I not in it to win it. I just want max xp with min effort and danger so I can do my laundry or shower etc while it runs. Just want the rewards to use in survival
---
We hear you fans!
---
Here at Bethedsa we work tirelessly to give you the best experience we can offer, it's what y'all deserve for all the great feedback on Fallout 76.
---
Starting tomorrow we will add one wallpaper per month that is exclusive to Fallout 1st. The wallpaper will go for 800 Atoms.
---
We wish you the very best in the future. Keep on rocking!
---
Exactly
---
I'm not being paid, I'm just doing what I'm told is best by Bethesda to enjoy their game in the best way!
---
Yes! Will do!
---
&gt; It was crazy to witness the birth and death of an entire mode at the hands of scared food builds 
---
Mode wasn't popular so they ditched it. There was literally one half filled server on PC for all of survival mode. No other servers because no one played it. No one playing = not worth dev time. Go back to Rust.
---
&gt; So much crying that Bethesda changed the very mechanics of legendary weapons and armor in survival, thus ruining the fun,
---
The pre nerf PvP meta was bullshit and you know it. One shot vats crit builds or teslas or GTFO. That, or use cheats or exploits to give godmode.
---
&gt;and driving PvP oriented players back to adventure to be able to use the weapons they work towards, killing an entire mode.  
---
LOL, you act like people earned their god tier pvp gear in survival. They did not. They farmed it in adventure or bought it on ebay or traded for it in adventure. No one earned shit in survival. Survival mode was for ganking deathmatches, and it wasn't even fun for that.
---
Sounds like you're just salty that your ebay bought duped gear isn't worth dick anymore.
---
Wait. Don't buy now. Wait until black Friday or when Wastelanders drops next year. No point getting it doing a content dead zone.
---
Bethesda Studios and Bethesda the publisher are different, Doom was made by ID, they are very skilled devs, Fallout is made by bethesda studios, they are not good at all.
---
Exactly. 
---
It's sad to see that people think that "supporting" someone by paying for products wrong advertised to get what they should have gotten from the beginning is the right thing to do, and that "no payers" are just poor rats wich like to hate/argue.
---
If Netflix would have asked for a single payment on their starters and then turned to periodic payment I'm 100% sure that 99% of the first payers would be upset, and the other 1% like OP would also feel like the voice of reason.
---
You've gotta sign in on the bethesda.net site, sign in and go to Transaction History. It'll be under the memberships tab
---
Are you saying it fails sometimes unless you hit 19.9? I've never noticed that. 
---
Nerd rage always triggers for me at 20.0, (confirmed [on video](https://youtu.be/gEQ2oUFs6AM) and [in the game files](https://i.imgur.com/JTWgkgy.png))
---
Just saw a level 0 guy named "Indecent." win games in a row.   
---
In two different games, I was far away hidden and he was able to shoot me from extreme distance where I shouldn't of even been visible. Then I spectated and saw him running around no gun until he was close to someone.   
---
Halloween event made me regain interest in Fallout 76, and Nuclear Winter and now suddenly I lost it.
---
Easy solution.
---
Make the Ranger Armor suit available for everyone to buy. But, let Fallout 1st members get the skin for free. Have people spend 1000 Atoms like the stupid price for the Captain Cosmos suit and Fallout 1st members get the skin for free with the subscription.
---
I should probably try some mutations thanks
---
&gt; then isn't fair to say that you're not experiencing the full game?
---
I am experiencing the full game, because the full game experience is still bare bones and is really just a slimmed down FO4.
---
Knowing the trajectory of this game Is say snow globes are realistic ... probably just need to spend $12/month and the switch the globe up every month or 2 😂
---
So just change it to where it unequips armor?
---
"Daily sales in the atom shop" = the same fucking stuff, day after day
---
If it's still available I got a couple of hours to purchase. Other wise tomorrow is good too.
---
This experiment gets more interesting by the day.
---
I am constantly amazed at what the rats can be forced to do just by dangling *atoms* in front of them. They complain, but continue to comply. Amazing!
---
But what else am I supposed to do? The game looked so exciting in the trailers and all I wanted was that experience they sold me. At this point, I'm happy to pay them if it means that experience gets ever closer to being a realty, no matter what.
---
Sure there is. But it feels a bit like a second home.
---
I don't usually even have my mic plugged in, I don't need the world hearing the weird things I say to myself
---
The irony of the bombs falling and fallout 1st releasing on Oct 23rd is not lost on me.
---
I get it, the state of this game is far from perfect, my last post was a rant about F1st, but the community is the last good this game has to offer.
---
Lets not make it any worse then it is by constantly fucking up every suggestion popping up by saying that they'll put it behind a paywall.
---
That way no one will suggest anything, and this whole board will just be filled with rage.
---
Where is the fun in that?
---
i have literally spent the last 6 months just refilling my junk stash to make workshop towns and fiddling with my house.
---
Not trying to defend Bethesda, but Im pretty sure they said they were going to do this back when they announced private worlds in the first place. The idea was that since less people are on a private server, the server would have less trouble handling larger builds. I could be wrong though, and don’t take this as me defending Fallout 1st.
---
" you don't even have the conviction to stand by this under your own account."
---
I'm sorry i don't really understand what you mean here. When did I show that I lacked conviction? Also can we keep my happiness out of this? This is only a video game we're talking about here, I probably don't need to see a therapist about fo76
---
Apply "some" of that. That's the saddest thing.
---
Yes, let's get a dinky souvenir toy in this game!
---
Even if they did this, they'd give you massively reduced exp for kills like the enemies in vault raids do.
---
Lots of little towns..
---
Welch for instance....
---
Probably the aa25 comabt rifle
---
It will be entertaining to see how many subscriptions were for only 1 mo.
---
Bethesda is waiting for the modding community to develop anti-cheat for them.
---
You can vats target the "spouts" on her head and she'll stop that
---
You're fooling yourself if you think anyone without a duped legacy explosive laser rifle and full set of sent armor stands a chance. Yeah, you need those perks too, but without the god tier gear they won't help that has them. That's why no one played survival. Sorry, I'm not going to go on ebay to spend money on duped crap to pad some low lifes pockets just so I have a fighting chance there. I'll go play NW instead and have a lot more fun.
---
Asylum outfits didnt count either
---
Yes,  check your pipboy and you'll see the increase in DR
---
WOW.   didnt even see another player.
---
Good for that one guy who actually got a real kill tho lol
---
Keep the quad tesla regardless of what other rifles, it is awesome for tagging mobs at events.  I am not a fan of TS weapons, I would keep the AAFFRFR Combat and the Furious handmade.
---
This. I don't blame the OP for doing this but it's the exact reason why the average player protests Fallout 1st. When games pursue "whales", they do so at the exclusion of the rest of the community. Their focus becomes a microcosm of the target community, and while they may provide great service to these folks who want the "whole game", that exclusion prevents continued investment over the long run.
---
Going after "whales" is what online games turn to when they realize that their appeal to the broader community is limited and they need to maximize their profit from the remaining players. It happens with older games that want to milk the most out of the player base before they're required to close down and move on. It happens when a game is on the decline. It doesn't happen when the game is growing.
---
The reason for the outcry from the community is that the game is so new, with so much potential, that folks are worried. I mean, we love this game too. We aren't here because we want it to fail. Even the hate posts are from passionate folks wishing that their favorite franchise wouldn't lock stuff behind a paywall, for a game that was already purchased.
---
The outcry is because of what Fallout 1st represents...the beginning of the end. You don't do this when you're adding subscribers. You don't do this when you have a long roadmap and monetization plan for the future. You don't do it for growth. You do it to delay the death.
---
Folks protesting Fallout 1st aren't saying, "Don't make Fallout 1st happen". They're saying, "Don't give up on the rest of us!" It's frustration of how gaming companies invest/reinvest in their games, in spite of the quality (or lack thereof) in what they release. Games like State of Decay, The Division, and other properties, get significant investment from developers long after they've made their money from the game. Whether this is pride in their work, or to bump their game higher in the store with "new releases" to get more sales, it doesn't matter. They keep investing, it makes their IP better, and it endears them to their customers.
---
Other companies, Bethesda in this case, have a lower quality bar, and while they committed to investing in FO76 "forever", they've now demonstrated that this is not true. Well...they could twist it to say they ARE investing, but just a really small amount, but that doesn't address the problem. Customers wanted this property to be what we were sold. When it wasn't, we expected a significant investment to remediate. When that didn't happen, we expected at least a modicum of support. When that didn't happen, and they delivered Fallout 1st, the writing was on the wall. This isn't a long-term investment anymore. It's a property that will die on the vine.
---
You'll be able to play Fallout 76 for years. I have no doubt. I suspect that in the next 3-4 years, there will be a replacement for Fallout 76, and they will entice existing players to leave for the new property that they promise will be better. Those of us that have been burnt already are unlikely to participate.
---
In short, folks like the OP perpetuate a practice that diminishes the quality of games, and post-sale support. The community anger is an effort to resist that practice, pitting buyers against passionate protesters. No one wins unless the community forces companies to experience the pain in their pocketbook. THAT is why there is hate for folks who contribute to this practice. OP may enjoy what they get from their money/investment, but everyone loses in the long run.
---
November 24th? Didn’t the game come out on the 14th? Does that mean anyone who put in a refund request in the first 10 days are fucked, you know, the most probable time when the majority of the consumers put in the request? That’s fucking shady.
---
Or Bethesda could, you know, fix it. Just a thought.
---
We are sorry to inform you that this bug does not in any way or form affect Fallout first membership.
---
As such we have marked this bug as a feature.
---
Thank you for taking the time to post this suggestion to help us make the best game Fallout could be.
---
They are just cosmetics. You still need the base backpack from Morgantown Airport.
---
I agree. There's no real reason why we can't.
---
I don’t think the paywall is the bigger issue here. For a game like this there needs to be a paywall of some sort. 
---
The big problem is the relationship between Bethesda and the community. 
---
Ideally players give Bethesda $$ and Bethesda makes the game better.  Players get what they want and Bethesda’s investors are happy. 
---
But really todo this Bethesda and the community need to work together. Right now there is no dialog. And it’s not just Bethesda’s fault. 
---
As a developer myself I would love to engage in conversations with my users but I’m not allowed. although I found away around this by a certain Facebook message board and my users are awesome there. 
---
But  Fallout76 developer....I feel for them. There is no way if I was one of them I would talk to players on Reddit. And in game? No way. 
---
This needs to change. 
---
 The person who started this thread is making a throw away account just because of how toxic the player community is. If this doesn’t clue us into the fact we have a problem then I don’t know what will. We as an online society have lost the ability to have respectful discussions where new ideas can flourish.
---
It's your money.  Do whatever you want with it.  If other people don't like it, they can suck your ass until their lips fall off.
---
But take your downvotes like a man next time ;-)
---
This. There was no skill involved.
---
"Private Worlds" Was announced alongside Fallout 1st so they did announce they were going to do it with Private Worlds, when they said private servers were coming during e3 they didn't speak much on it because they were too focused on the game in general, we never got told private servers would be behind a pay wall or any of the other "utility" items would be implemented how they were.
---
Why would you expect any different?
---
This happened long before 1st existed.
---
&gt; but when I payed my 60 bucks at the start, I did that with the intention of playing the WHOLE game. I don't like it when parts of the game, or features, are denied to me, so I'll pay to have them back
---
I won't say how you should spend your money, but this what Bethesda is hoping for.  They want as much money out of you for as little content as possible.  They could provide everything to you in the 1st subscription, but they know they can squeeze more money out of you if they put it behind yet another paywall instead.
---
If you're having a fun time with it and you think it's worth the price, that's absolutely up to you and no one else.  But they are taking advantage of you.
---
Literally about 20 people on PC. Not enough to fill a server during prime time.
---
Are you starting to get it now?
---
You should be ashamed of yourself. Disgusting response.
---
People like you is why big corporations keep fucking up their games (EA, Zenimax, Ubisoft) Because you will pay for extra content that should be on the game already. With that statement these corporations can see that launching a half assed game with lots of technical problems is fine cause there's ultra loyal fanbase and people who will buy everything cause it has its name. I don't mind microtransactions like in GTA 5, all the content since 2013 was free and the only thing you can buy is the games money. The prices were inflating meanwhile but you can grind for the money or pay for it, i respect that. But launching a game with so many problems like this one, at a full price (i got it on release) i expect a fully done game, definitely not what i had. Adding that this year mainly focused on the atom shop cause theres no more content this year, and add on top the new paywall for items. While the bugs for the subscription were easily hotfixed, theres still bugs from day 1, but that matters very little cause big corps only care about money, and the developers will do what the owners say. So if you want a full game, stop putting these piss poor excuses and dont pay for them, but i guess thats too late now
---
Yes, but I have no clue why.
---
Not nearly as much fun as killing Muties though.
---
They really have gone overboard with some of this stuff. The brightly colored wallpapers are not the worst offender in the shop though.
---
They really need to stick to the retro-future fallout aesthetics or the whole illusion falls apart.
---
More post-apoc beat up items would really help. Where are we getting all this new stuff????
---
Only if Wastelanders fixes all the problems with this game. Otherwise I might not just be done with this game but any Bethesda game depending on how badly it's screwed up.
---
Yeah, Hopefully they'll fix it now that you First Citizens are having an issue with it.
---
Hope she doesn't find out about his Fallout First subscription. That would make things worse!
---
Makes sense. Given the cheater climate I totally get it.
---
Yeah man, i say go for it.
---
Icons are the cheapest thing to make. Why give you something of real value for free?
---
The infinite stash just makes it easier for them to continue ruining the game.
---
Furious Handmade. DPS is great. Equip Adrenal Reaction mutation, Adrenaline Perk, Gun Fu, Concentrated Fire. Win.
---
Snowflake deathclaw gets OWNED by bloodied explosive economic policy
---
Ha! "Bongo, Bongo, Bongo" is my jam, but mute is my friend because my singing voice sounds like a cat with it's tail caught in a door! Lol.
---
If I had just learned about the game today, with the details of what's already locked behind a monthly fee, I would not even consider buying it.
---
Not a complaint exactly, I have absolutely gotten my money's worth.  But I don't get involved with games that don't provide 'the full game' unless you pay extra.
---
Now, if it were a free game, and had subscriber benefits, I probably wouldn't mind much.  I might try it, and decide if it's a good match and if the fee is worth what you get.
---
Hell, if they tell you up front that it's $60 and there's a monthly subscription, I'm fine with that.
---
76 was neither of those.  I paid up front, with no indication that I'd end up paying that fee over and over or they'd withhold features.  It really says a lot about the current management of the company.
---
Whats the point of this cheat? 
---
Only reason i could see using it for would be to sell other players wins if they pay for it.
---
Doing solo or with another cheater make no sense.
---
Probably an issue with the mod. Good to know either way
---
This is a good tool to experiment and see how it affects damage.

I could see that working if you added more cars and circled around a time or two.  My guess is the whitespring required very little additions and they've been trying to promote the whitespring as a hub for a while now.  I honestly think lag was the only issue with using the whitespring but lag is the whitespring's chief export so we really got served.
---
Sure and maybe we can make masks obstruct our vision too /s
---
He got u a gift. How cute!
---
Did you post on twitter? They seem to keep a eye on it more than here.
---
Lol fallout 76 pvp ? Why?

---
Lucky you. I can't build anymore since I reached the building limit. I'm quite happy with the location and built itself, but sadly I can't decorate it any further.
---
"When you die, can I harvest you for Bone Shards?"
---
Yes. Yes they are. You're willing to spend so much on so little already, you're primed to spend more. I expected nothing less from Bethesda.
---
Are you getting it now?
---
No they're just abusing the players left and ripping them off to support their next games
---
You can! Press the emote and at the exact same time press ESC (start on controller) to open up the pause menu. Open photo mode. Enjoy!
---
I actually have a product like that started as a one time payment. Turned out they lost their ass with it and couldn’t keep paying the monthly bills with no influx of cash.  They switched to the subscription model. I understand it was either that or close the doors then there would be no product.  Bethesda should have known better. Or maybe they did and just didn’t want to say anything
---
Yeah, that'll turn their pr around.
---
Right. The atom shop was a failure because their artists suck ass and cant design good cosmetics. Or they went full in for the fortnite dress-like-a-moron crowd. Either way most of the shit in the store i wouldnt fucking wear if it was FREE. 
---
Then they wonder why they cant fund continued development.
---
Novice has no timer for any raids and enemies in a given area eventually stop spawning. In Dead In The Water, the reactor needs to be restarted on a timer (separate to the overall timer) but failing that doesn't fail the entire raid.
---
ok thanks
---
Omg you’re right! I just got your notification as I was in game and tried it immediately and it worked! THANK YOU KIND SIR!!
---
this
---
The whole bottom row isn't even on sale.  OP owns the other two, so I can't even see if those are discounted.  There's no point in that section being there.
---
Hey, black titanium is black titanium.
---
They were selling power armor skins and emotes at xmas last year.... for 1800 each. $18 each.
---
Before. 76 was meant to be their redemption arc but look how far they have fallen.
---
Have very little faith or interest in Starfield or Elder Scrolls 6.
---
You’re welcome! 😄
---
Yep, I've given up on NW and FO76 in general. If you are going to make an online game you need a way to deal with hackers, especially in a AAA game.
---
Thats all it is. Decals are the same too.
---
Damn. The map guy used to be so active on this sub and I haven’t seen him around much. Starting to think no ones left from the beta anymore
---
He wasn't joking.
---
The next 2 outfits are saved to entice people to re sub up till january.
---
If you're not already, consider seeing a therapist. These issues can highlight other greater issues &amp; not addressing it will only compound the issue.

That's good you're saving some of it for college, I have a kid who could give a fuck about that and prefers to just spend most of his money and time on video games. And I guarantee you that Bethesda and all the other game companies don't give a fuck if he goes to college either as long as he is throwing money at them.
---
I believe all of the challenges are cross-character that you can only complete once, but you will have access to all your Atom Shop stuff.  That's account-based.
---
I'd go with the Furious Handmade but trial it against that AA combat rifle.
---
I can respect that, but I haven't bought 1st, because the value just isn't there and it feels more like gouging than a genuine show of support.  Being on console and having 76 be the only game I'm playing online means that I'm already paying monthly for this (as opposed to PC players), and the Atom shop items are WAY overpriced (so the "free atoms" are still a ripoff.  
---
I love this game (paid full price at launch).  I want to support this game ongoing (and can do so financially).  Instead of giving me a reasonable subscription option with solid benefits, they have made my character a 2nd class wastelander and asked for a premium price on a less-than premium product.  That's just bad business, especially when the main benefit of the service (cosmetic crap and access to assets already in the game) don't cost them anything.
---
Oh my God. Talk about being so entitled. If you paid for 1st, you got exactly what you deserved.
---
Same here got mine even though I haven't played in 3 months. I would rather support them and see  an awesome evolution to something like ESO scale. But that takes money
---
That's really more of a reflection of how unbalanced the legendary effects are. 
---
Anything with an explosive/bloodied/junkies is absurd damage.
---
i was over level 300 when i got the white helmet from the event Fertile Soil around 2-3 month ago and i didn't play the event (or any forrest events ) for ages.
---
But I thought they said that loads of people bought the subscriptions? So clearly there's more of us 'left' than you think!
---
Stop playing
---
I'm sure we'll get a "Secured server" pass that guarantees* a hacker free experience for the low low price of $99.99 any day now.
---
Weird, I thought you guys weren’t going to release anything until you make sure it works. That was the reason we were given for having to pay $100 to have something new to do for four months until that top priority free expansion comes out.
---
Didnt do anything for me accept annoy me that they refund people who are morally angry about something but an actual fault with their game they wouldnt refund me 70p worth of atoms
---
Lets be honest, this isn't a AAA game.
---
If only Bethesda cared
---
Thanks for sticking up for me, but tbh I don't see myself as a die hard fan or anything, I just want to play the game I payed for.
---
That one is the small backpack and skins from the atom shop don't work on it. You have to complete the tadpole scout quests to get the real backpack on each character then you can apply the skin you purchased on them.
---
Yep, it was every bit as hilarious as I expected!
---
I know I just want better stairs and a nice garage door
---
I will have to try Project Paradise, have not done that one yet, nor have I seen anyone join it at night when I am normally online and I do not believe you can solo that one.
---
Yea probably.
---
It boggles my mind when people say this. I paid $60 once, got a hundred hours out of the game and now I expect them to cater to my needs the rest of the games life as well as give me free DLC.
---
You paid for the main game and the little content additions plus fixes, if you want a wholy new experience you should have to pay for that.
---
They’re having some down time after all the Halloween stuff. Do you expect a massive atomic shop drop every week? I’d like that too, but I don’t know if it’s realistic to hope for.
---
I want that communist China bundle! Power armor skin looks too fun.
---
Maybe they'll introduce Private NW matches for First Citizens where you go up against 51 dumbass AIs and ZAX tells you how amazing you are.
---
A bush doesn't save you from the guy shooting at the sky
---
That’s only PC 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I don’t have issues with cheaters on Xbox, but I do have issues with latency with my connection. Not noticeable on adventure but it is in battle royale games. Annoys me so much when it looks like I shot first and kill someone and then a second I drop dead and they have no health gone
---
I understand wanting what they were selling with the original trailers, that's what I wanted really bad. I love all the other fallouts, but this game is very very far from what they promised. All buying more does is show their spreadsheets that people love paying for shit that should already be part of a base game, so they'll keep charging for everything.
---
Thats dope
---
Open mic is open mic.  If ur that concerned dont have open mic.
---
Before Halloween we had a 5 week drought... Then 2 week of some meh halloween stuff and another wait?
---
If you like puttering around in a giant sandbox Fallout world, then this is for you. I've been playing this game like it was my second job for almost a year now, and still love playing it.
---
At the same time, there's a small diehard group of "76 CaN dO No WrOnG" folks. 
---
Since the "yes" replies were so few, if a few of them slipped in a few dozen extra entries, that would skew the data much more than someone slipping in a few dozen extra "no" replies.
---
They’re insanely different. People are comparing them because they want any opportunity to shit on 76.
---
I've invited you. Let me know how you want it set up. I'm presuming auto fire / reflex sights / drum magazine?
---
The Ranger Armor mod for Fallout 4 looks better than this
---
Clearly they need to nerf legendary fatman
---
This is a damn voice of reason here
---
And jet packs need fixed!!!
---
Tough shit. 😢
---
Not necessarily. If you have the wrong build and wrong buffs your explosive/bloodied/junkies weapon isn't doing squat. Not to mention with a revolver there's no spray and pray. It's all about positioning yourself and VATS. You can't hide behind a shush gun so it takes one shot all all hell breaks loose. It's challenging and with the right build deadly.
---
Thank you for your kind response, although I can't take credit for proposing new ideas in this conversation, i don't think I'm that smart!
---
To be honest with you, I feel very sad when I play this game, because I sometimes worry that bethesda don't know what they're doing to make the better, probably because of a lack of communication as you said. All I can do is take their word for it when they say something to me like:  
---
A Fo1st is the best way to play the game
---
What else can I do as a customer but take their word for it and pay up. Otherwise I fear they might abandon the game.
---
*buffs it to launch a full sized nuke*
---
Ran into him several times as well last few days. Also ran into the infamous Vurkrin guy, among many others.
---
Otherwise I’m sure people would shoot me in the water or in a bush like I wasn’t hiding. Instead I can get groups of people walk a few feet from my bush and not see me and walk on by.
---
Goes on sale Feb 1st for 300 caps each! Oh and it's vaulting ;D
---
Absolutely. It could also be super bulky and give a negative to agility, if we're talkin realism.
---
200 atoms
---
199 if you have FO1st
---
Yes... send Bethesda a video of yourself exploiting so you can exploit in secret... Not like Bethesda already lacks any and all detection of hackers/exploiters in game currently so the only way to "get caught" is video evidence...
---
I farm fort defiance for junk and potential asylum worker colored uniforms.
---
Just watch out for the ghouls in the right wing from the entrance.
---
I can't believe I didn't see this while it was occurring. I'm dying from laughter here.
---
Lol FF subscriber detected
---
Oof.
---
A lot of really great ideas in there. In a nutshell, allow private servers to be opened up various ways with a corresponding matchmaking setup for players . I like the concept, though I'm not sure Bethesda has the chops to develop something this robust. Though, In the meantime, there's always Discord.
---
I never said I was having fun the game, I just want the game, all of it. Otherwise I just missing out on something which might just be the thing I'm looking for to improve my enjoyment. I don't think they're taking advantage of me, if anything I think that players who got the game on sale and don't contribute to the sales of the Atoms store are kind of taking advantage
---
Wecolme back to another episode today ill show you how to summon scorched queen with a fatman. Dont for get to like and subscribe if you havnt
---
I gotta admit there is something attractive to this whole idea to me hahaha.
---
Truth. This is the experience I'd expect when downloading a *Fallout 4: Multiplayer* mod from Nexus.
---
Me too! the wallpaper is a really nice colour and looks great!. i also bought the red rocket pack! finally got me a rocket!
---
Yeah those darn could always one hit me
---
My wife insisted we get mics for playing in case anyone wanted to talk.
---
My wife insisted we put the mics away when I started wandering the wasteland belting out "COUNTRY ROOOOOOOOOOOAAAADS, TAKE ME HOOOOOOOOOOME"
---
I'd rather people just have a conversation about it and tell me why they disagree with what I'm saying than just downvote but yeah I get what you mean
---
Fair enough. You're looking for a pretty niche group there. Goodluck!
---
If there are only a few players left, and I'm not hearing any combat, I'm gonna plant turrets and mines around the remaining part of the map, then start bombarding any suspicious-looking bush or shadowy area until I get a hit marker. My team and I will be closely grouped together, and we'll immediately pounce on bush campers. If they move, they die. If they stay, they die. Their only opportunity to survive was to confront us in force when they had the initiative.
---
If we have a briefcase, we'll just form a firing line and nuke everything except for the smallest sliver of the map. If the campers run to safety, we mow them down. If they run into the fire, they die. Anything left over, we clean up when we move into the blast zone in force.
---
Camping and expecting everyone else to just keel over and die is a losing strategy.
---
ROFL, no a subscription literally does that, eso+ they call a subscription yet gives paid dlc as well. So Bethesda and most people consider them one and the same.
---
Maybe I'm just spoiled, because every other game I've bought has been handled differently.
---
Updates and fixes come with the games, and it's always been that way.  Subscriptions are stated up front.  DLC (which isn't what we're talking about here) and expansions are paid, unless they're offered for free (and I've seen both).
---
Never once have I bought a game that was full priced and offered free DLC, but charged a monthly fee for basic game updates.  And this wasn't advertised that way either, so it's not like it was expected.
---
How does Bethesda make the same mistake as GTA: Online five years after GTA: Online?
---
They also brought back the Red Rocket Pack.. so there is that! i got me a nice new red rocket :)
---
Your internet connection?
---
Thanks! It's hard to save money these days it seems, and my current job doesn't exactly make me a millionaire... retail...
---
it might sound to some but sometimes the idea of looking in the atoms store and buying something new for the game kinda cheers me up
---
I mean the red rocket bundle is back too! so there is that.. and the wallpaper is really nice.. im happy haha.
---
Nah, they just betta than you. Get good scrubs.
---
Sounds like you and I would get along during a match. My team and I play similarly. Only downside to my playstyle is I get kill bill vision sometimes and stray a bit too far from the team in an attempt to flank..haha 
---
Some folks would refer to us as seekers, hunting down the hiders
---
I wont lie i play on 4k with low graphics and high object fade destince when it comes to pvp. People are way easier to find
---
You're a little bit unhinged, aren't you? 
---
Anyone can cherry-pick a single video clip. And I'm not going to bother with you any more. Over and over again, people just like you that are far too "good" at a game to be natural and use subtle "assistance" get away with it for years, then get found out. I have no problem going toe-to-toe with any OTHER player over lvl 100. A "skill" gap that wide simply isn't adequate explanation. Unfortunately I don't have the means to record, and anything you release is obviously not going to contain anything suspicious so long as you are paying attention. But I have working eyes and the ability to reason. 
---
Besides, I posted here for 2 reasons. First, to corroborate the OP's suspicions, warn people what you are up to and suggest a few counters. And second, to get a rise out of a dickhead with an ego more fragile than a glass butterfly (That ego being the reason you continue to do almost nothing but play a single game, mode, and cheat at it day after day though you have already accomplished everything possible with it.). 
---
I have succeeded on both counts. Buh bye, psycho!
---
I sure hope so!
---
Yeah! I would love a wall with just plain asses all over it, Maybe they can modify the Tire walls and make some nice Ass Walls, one with chains and one without, NICE!
---
This is a community sub-reddit, not means to complain to a corporation. No one cares. They said there would be 1st exclusive content, you shouldn't of expected it to be included lol.
---
Just paying $$ isn’t going to get you that. Pay the money because you like/want what they are selling you. Don’t pay it for hopes and dreams.
---
Yeah lol probably :(
---
On PC I've run into the same handful of hackers the last few days, "RS-Overboss \*insert name\* "  "Mezz\*\*\*n" "Mai\*\*\*\*ent" "Ros\*\*\*\*bot" and a couple others that I can't recall.
---
It's just ridiculous. I'd get 1-2 shot with marine Armour on, with the guy  just 180ing to shoot me and other players..
---
Wait, *this* is the line? 
---
I'm only asking cause the goalpost is out of the stadium right now and halfway down the interstate. I think you're kind of being unreasonable though. Just wait another two weeks or so and they'll add something worse and we can forget all about camp budgets and stash sizes.
---
You should be ashamed of yourself for subbing to FF
---
If you liked the old ones this one this will satisfy.
---
In its state now i would avoid it, Go destiny 2. Its free too play now and only charges for cometics and dlc. Thats how i get my grinding kick.
---
Of course they will wait till you spend your free atoms then release a better version of the outfit they gave you🙈
---
That is true! Before Halloween it was weeks of nothing. I think if they drop that communist China bundle next week it’ll help keep up the flow. And it would be best if they don’t keep doing those empty weeks.
---
Clear your friends list, remove and drop all excess randoms notes and holotapes you have.
---
Oh yeah, using a bar and the fancy mirror would be nice, I just use the dresser with a mirror attached and a punch bowl on top for a "sink" lolol
---
Hmmm...how does one go about that? Call the company? Is there an online service? If it's too much of a pain in the ass I'll just take the 8 dollar loss. But if it's reasonably simple it may be worth my time to bother getting my atoms back to spend on something else.
---
Lol dear god I hope not.
---
But the are not charging for "basic game updates" you and I still get the same updates. You and me will get wastelanders the same way. The only difference is, I get atoms monthly, and in all reality early access to game mechanics or exclusive access to certain cosmetics or game mechanics.
---
I appreciate it, I've received nothing but support to make me want to keep doing it.
---
I've yet to play this mode. Not surprised people are cheating.
---
Thanks for your detailed response, it was very interesting to read! I think that bethesda have been very generous with the game for people who don't want to engage with the extra features on offer. 
---
As I mentioned to someone a while ago, sometimes spending money in the atoms store cheers me up, to see something new for my game. I don't have loads of money, and yeah I probably spend more than some on this game, but it's because I want bethesda to do a good job in the future and continue support. 
---
Otherwise, what would have been the point in getting all those additional items from the store if they just cancelled the game after 6 months? It wouldn't have made sense. That's why I got got Fo1st
---
Fallout is certainly very anti social for a multi player game.
---
Thank you - just what I was after!
---
I have 4 alts for that though it really sucks with the limitation of plans. But i also am slowly leveling them all as i go. Mostly i build on the workshops and while they go away when i log or crash. Its pretty fun to me anyway.
---
Same, it's when 5 spring on you at once.  Ghouls are very strong in close quarters.  You kill 3, the other 2 kill you.
---
Fun times.
---
Lol I think that qualifies for the 40% more power attack damage!
---
No that would be lag, for me its the fps that drops to zero all the time.
---
I'm a raider character 99% of the time and boy do I have stories to confess 😂 too bad you're on ps4
---
 I wouldn't call hired college students incompetent, but inexperienced. And all those proffesional devs dont care about this game, and leave it rot with those students, so they dont get the backlash.
---
Better hope it rolls 90% reduced weight or you’ll be lugging around a 150 pound weapon!
---
You and I get the same updates, but only the one paying the extra fee gets to use them all.
---
Again, I didn't sign up for that, and if they'd told me what they wanted to do before getting my money, I wouldn't be complaining (or playing).
---
Beth probably is considering to charge money for reporting players rn
---
Not "exactly" what you are looking for, but you can use rugs to maneuver display cases over shelves that you have placed "buildables" on in order to "fill" the cases. Takes a bit of finagling.
---
Maybe the shitty code was interfering with their cheats. 
---
Lol the engines inability to accept new inputs without imploding is a natural self defense.
---
The lack of these is just... mystifying.
---
Yeah, I'll agree with you there. Maybe the devs are just inexpierenced but Bethesda as a whole is incompetent
---
you get a free $16.50 a month in atoms lol what more do you want for your $8.33 a month... I mean thats fucking 50% off AND you get private servers and all this other shit... What the fuck are you frustrated about?
---
They probably enjoy griefing. They could be like 10-15 years old too and just enjoy the hilarious OPness of their cheat.
---
Mine disappeared about four days ago. PC here. It sucks to not be able to wave at people.
---
NW was the only thing that almost made me go back... Played it a bit on the first map and really enjoyed it. Then uninstalled the game the free up some space for other games but I recently started longing for that sweet overseer xp... Guess I'll wait and see if Bethesda does anything about the cheating problem.
---
If people know that a whole heap of good stuff will be coming just before X date, they'll wait instead of spend! Spend! SPEND!
---
What a beast
---
Its RP, it is pretty niche from the offset, bit it is the lightest of RP at a minimum
---
Too late.
---
Dailies, dailies , and more dailies
---
Buying skins for real money is nonsense
---
Kill 30 scorchbeasts. Ad victoriam
---
Millions of people don't agree with you.
---
Gotta spend that 1327 free atoms each month on something I guess.
---
Oh, no they will develop it. But it will cost you 10 bucks a hour.
---
This is fucking hilarious to see, now that everyones ok with the subscription assfuck they pulled, this entitled whining starts roflrofl
---
Wish i could say i know ur joking
---
You can display stuff in NV? Or was that a mod?
---
Will try to that thank you.
---
Raise your wanted level and pvp
---
Wasn't that part of the meta with PUBG?
---
...for the $$$!
---
I liked that they brought back the Red Rocket Bundle! i was really wanting that rocket ship! the Wallpaper they brought out today is actually really nice too. great colour and looks good on the walls!. i cant wait for the communist pack.. i want those new floors, and rugs, and wallpapers! i think they just need more rugs in general!
---
Songs they make a major patch to go with that thing I'll be happy
---
Have you done a file system restore and see if that helps?
---
Sorry for your loss... Amazing build video! I subscribed :)
---
I log in and see if I'm low on any resources and determine from there what I do. If I need resources it's most likely for ammo; so I'll run wes tek and lucky hole. 
---
If I'm pretty set at the time I like to pick a road and travel hitting locations as I go. Doing events and daily's as I encounter them. The fallout environments are unparalleled for me, I can really forget about things and explore in this game more so than any other. That goes for past fallouts also.
---
Why was this removed?
---
Yeah, and the best part is simply just how willing I am to over look people like you so long as I dont catch you doing stuff like that. I sit here and tell you great lines like "you want to know how this works? God doesnt forgive you, he merely gives us the strength to forgive ourselves
---
Junkie’s and Bloodied still tend to be popular at the moment.
---
Cause it makes no difference? What does current content have to do with a subscription. Their both mmos and both have similar subs. Im more mad that first doesnt give me more building budget.
---
Nice on anything soecific or just anything
---
Sorry that $100 isn't a game breaker for some people
---
Yup, had this happen to me. Seems silly they should be "equiped" all the time...
---
Fairly rare. Among some of the more rare plans in the game. Not the rarest, but 2nd tier.
---
Bahahahaha
---
1- Definitely agree frog legs should be a marsupial serum you can find. Every hacker I see runs it too.  Even at the cost of 9 agility, it's too OP.
---
2- I've had a couple AFKer teammates in a few games, it's annoying af. I don't get why they do teams, if they're just gonna afk? They don't get anything extra out of it. I've  seen AFK teammates leave as soon as they die. If you're gonna afk, just solo queue, don't go in with a team, you're just being an a-hole, taking up a spot of an actually useful teammate. 
---
3- I think you should get bonus XP for taking out a squad  and get more XP for reviving a teammate. Also, if you die and your squad wins, you should get some sort of shared XP. As is, there's no incentive at all to stay to the end of a match when you're spectating, except if you're actually teamed up with friends. 
---
4- I've had no issue with Scorchbeasts, even in wood or scout armour, me and a teammate can easily take them out.
---
5- I just walk away from them or turn my sound down.
---
Haha maybe it's the power armor addition!
---
There was a stand for the snowglobes in Mr Vegas his tower
---
Well, this game does have a boat load if suckers.
---
Well first of all, they just released an exclusive area for the Atomic Shop today. You have to be a 1st member to be able to purchase it, on top of your annual $100.
---
A paywall within a paywall, just as the leak said. Guess they aren't rumors, huh.
---
*You were saying?*
---
Just in general
---
I have a fresh install of the game and still get this
---
I agree both ways.  Its just digital items in the game but same time the money (hopefully) will support game and keep them interested in keeping the servers up.
---
I can confirm.  Lost my back-stock of bug parts as well.  It's apparently also true of unscrapped junk of any sort.  I'd set aside some some junk items for later display or sale, and they disappeared after a crafting session last night. (To clarify: I had those items in Stash, not Scrapbox.) Had plenty of the appropriate scrap in my Scrapbox, but crafting evidently still prioritized unscrapped Stash junk.  Be careful of your collectibles, folks.  Items placed in display cases are also apparently safe, FWIW.
---
Thank you for your condolences. Your sub is much appreciated!
---
My mom was in a lot of pain over the last year. She was only 58. We were all very surprised when we got the call. Thank you for your kind comment.
---
cant do that, because the people who wear it cosmetically would complain.
---
they would either need 2 versions, or to ignore the player base.
---
Honestly it's barely A game.
---
Now that there are refrigerators, a decent food and drink build is viable.  Add some vendors to the camp and sell items to make loads of caps.  I also heard that bloody builds are pretty good.
---
To think people called those rumors fake. Toxic ball-gargling subreddit defending a product made to rape their wallets. Yet they call everyone else Trolls.
---
Do not buy Starfield or ES6.
---
I just spawn in the middle of the map on my camp, do all the worthy events, then the enclave events, then sell the rewards to the vendors. If no other event worth completing is active, go to west tek, harpers ferry (first up then go to the burrows, always), watoga south (by the trainyard) and then kill all stuff that moves. Then i head north through the mire, killing any steakhouse and robco center stuff that moves. If i need steel, go to blackwater mine and pick up every weapon and steel-related junk it spawns, then i move to west tek and do the same. Scrap all weapons with the scrapper perk and head up to the big tunnel south of the map (dont remember the name) take everything, kill everything. Head to the tunnel until you are on the other side, repeat. If lead is needed, lucky hole mine with excavator grants 1.5k and super duper. Then check the map to see if any event pops off, and repeat
---
Hell, I got 4 Pirate hats out of all the MN runs (got two in a row once) and had still yet to of gotten the matching costume for it. I only ever got 1 Costume and that was on one of my last runs. I only got the suits once each as well. But the Grim Reaper Vault boy? I got like 7 of those.
---
Fake rumors they said. HA!
---
Fuck me I guess for having an opinion? I won't have feeling about anything and be a perfect fucking robot just for you, mmkay?
---
My guess is BGS wants to have the subscription be the base economy of the game.  The Atom Store isn't doing enough (partly their fault for putting out garbage cosmetics) so they pretty much will  be pushing the sub and half-@ss the Atom store until Wastelanders drops.  They probably have a TON of Wastelander crap ready for sale, but after delay, they just are stuck scrounging for old stuff and new trivial stuff not related to Wastelanders.  Rumor has it Subs are doing well and they want to use the subscription $$ maintain the game and pay for new content.  The Atoms store cosmetic stuff will just be pure profit.
---
Ight cheers man
---
I actually drop a bag full of said parts b4 ammo production, but the vendor thing is more reliable. Even w/o Fallout 1st, bug parts get eaten b4 bulk acid(!) So unbulk any acid prior to making rounds.
---
Or use Atoms earned while playing.
---
Or use 500 of the 1650 monthly Atoms allowance provided by Fallout 1st.
---
It really is as simple as that.
---
Because idiots will still pay for it. 
---
That's the long and short of it. They'll also defend Bethesda for the pleasure of giving them money as well. Why would they stop?
---
So?
---
How does the monthly or yearly 1st membership atoms drop work btw? Still haven’t got nov atoms for my subscription. Does it drop on the day of purchased 1st membership? So, monthly and yearly 1st members aren’t getting anything relate for free for membership. Just another outfit charged 500 atoms which should come with the subscription. Wow Bethesda. Really testing people’s patience.
---
I didn’t realize people used keyboard / mouse with console.   That would definitely help. Thank you. 
---
(Disclaimer:  non-sarcasm)
---
Yeah if it's even possible to solo, I wouldn't recommend it. I find that often just having one person show up at Project Paradise and hang out, without hitting the button, makes it more likely that other folks will show up. And hey, if you're on PC, I'm always down for running it when it's up.
---
Yep.  Pretty creative I’ve seen two camps in the last week set up this way
---
So I still have 1150 from my monthly alottment?
---
Sweet!!
---
Complete all the daily Atom challenges.
---
Your english is very good, I got that all very clearly. Thanks! I might have to try it sometime, even if it's just in a private world. &gt;_&gt;
---
Hmm-what is the skin? Does anybody have the link for the atom shop update?
---
Or he could just be getting xp, making meat cleavers .. plans dropped from the recent event, even I got a meat clever plan .. old trick you could with knives if you had too much steal .. sounds far fetched to me, I doubt you would bother duping meat cleavers .. maybe he is making them and selling them ..
---
I don’t have the link, but it’s just the same armor with a greenish hue.
---
It is really ludicrous that First Citizens are getting pissed about shit that Bethesda already explained, you can PURCHASE the premium atom shop cosmetics... Yet y'all aren't outraged they fucking lied about the content they hid behind a subscription.
---
&gt;Doing solo or with another cheater make no sense.
---
Well there has to be a reason that makes perfect sense. We could have several guesses but we just can't know.
---
I get still using the junk storage after your sub runs out. But what if i build a fallout 1st full budget base and then my sub runs out? lol
---
👍
---
Uhh, I guess?
---
Q click is also an instant headshot, and q space click is an instant critical hit headshot.
---
Woke up quick, at about noon - just thought I had to get to Whitesping soon.  Gotta get junk, before my night begins - cause I can't get plastic when I'm with my friends.  Scorchbeat blast got me about blind - like the bitch ain't seen my FREE STATES signs.  Take a step back and I grabs a clip, for the Resolute Veteran firing from the hip.  Beast goes down and I change my weapon, got the Grognak's Axe for all them Scorched that's steppin.  Check the dailies and the weekly progress, bitch ass atoms got me under duress.  But then I let the jet pack goooooooo - I was bouncing around, nothing cramping my flow, it was gangsta gangsta and I could not resit, then I played my own way it went something like DISCONNECTED BY SERVER
---
And Bugthesda giving the middle finger to everyone!  Not just non-first players. 
---
Greedy and hilarious at the same time what else do you expect?
---
Gotcha. So the ranger armor with a green hue? Is there anything worthwhile that was added?
---
There were all sorts glitches on this game. They try closing them off but make it worse or open another portal to a glitch |hack. Bethesda needs to take that money invested off 1st members and buy some decent admin mods who can do their jobs to fix the game problems.
---
I'm pretty sure that when they say "borderline" they actually mean "definitely P2W, but we will check to see if people will pay for it"
---
Expect things like Plans, weapons/items, T-99 Power armor, special mutations, etc.
---
Imagine if Fallout 1st members were the only ones who got an ammo converter.  or if they got a machine that produces nuka colas, or if they got special new exclusive perk cards.  
---
THATS what they mean by "borderline". they dont mean the border between cosmetic and pay to win, they mean the border between keep getting money and stop getting money.
---
Not to fallout 1st if that’s what you’re asking.
---
Pay to win?
---
You know what i dont get... For now this game has pretty much 0 replayability. 
---
So what does bethesda think people will do in this game that will keep them subscribed for eternity? 
---
Its not like a WoW type game or something like that.
---
Nah just in general. Been waiting for an Enclave bundle for a while
---
Ewe
---
Haha thank you!! I had to use the google translator tbh.
---
All my support to you with this 'reward event database' proyect!
---
No, nothing like that, sorry to say.
---
I would have also liked an enclave bundle.
---
hey beth pick up ur game. maybe drink some mountain dew?
---
Communist salute was probably not meant to be available when it was so they removed it.
---
BOHICA!  
---
Bend over here it comes again 
---
As a non first player I am laughing my ass off at this move
---
Free Art!
---
straya!
---
I would lose my mind
---
Really appreciate it! But I'm on PC
---
Hey everybody look, another internet troll twisting people's words! I never said I was pissed. Pissed and frustrated are two entirely different things. I was just posting to start a discussion about it, but fuck me for thinking anyone on Reddit could be reasonable. I guess that was my first mistake.
---
Vats was great on survival
---
lmao, you have no clue how statistics work.
---
What you describe is simple one time event possibility.
---
Statistics is what everybody else is frustrated about, and you are the one who doesn't get it
---
luckily the boost will probably be small, like 10% or something.  easily handlable by the servers, but just enough to pass that desirability threshold.  its not going to be like 1000% or whatever.
---
note: I'm against this, im just saying
---
is it possible to have a class action lawsuit kickstarter against bethesda's bait and switch marketing ploys? i wonder if any lawyers can seriously help theorise this
---
Game will be dead in a year, there is only so much to do and rewards are shitty no matter the game mode. Wastelanders is BGS's attempt to keep ppl invested, but most ppl will tap out when they realize the game is not going to fill the fun/interesting void, the game will only cater to paying customers at that point. Alienating most of the base with shallow paywalls will be the death of 76.
---
I don't very much see the point of this thread, then. if you're not asking for it to be nerfed then I'll just repeat my original point: it's very patronizing of you to assume that people need a warning that bloodied "makes the game too easy".
---
specially because lots of people want builds as optimized as possible. there's little reason not to be bloodied if you go the stealth route, for one.
---
Exactly right
---
At least the middle finger still applies to all players
---
Between food rent and paying bills. I will invested in life over Bethesda who hasn’t taken liberty to put patches and hotfixes to their game. Games aggression is off the charts
---
Don’t get me wrong I enjoyed 76 for a long time, I tried to focus on the positives as much as possible. Just such a shame they show absolutely no sign of trying to make the game better.
---
Other first person shooters is a ban for competitive
---
Yeah, but I feel like it should just be included with the subscription, right? It’s arguably not worth he money as it stands, and adding this skin for free would be a good incentive for folks to keep paying for the subscription.
---
log in to a bunch of party invites, thenhit my 2-9 raids (mission dependant).
---
afterwords i hit tanagra and lucky hole for ammo production, then pop over to defiance for fiber. (steel is easy enough to come by)
---
at the end of the day i just hang out and hit events that pop up, if im in a good mood il drop a nuke instead
---
That’s awesome!
---
When you buy the sub you get atoms.... no need to spend actual $. What else are you goin to do with the atoms of not spend them in the shop?
---
To be fair, that's pretty much how badass you feel when you use one.
---
I care and there are lots of people that feel the same way as OP.
---
Nobody said that, they're saying that singling out the 1st members is pointless when people were doing it before 1st was a thing. Instead of just being mad at the 1st members, be mad at ALL of the dupers.
---
Why do you care what other people’s characters look like? It has no baring on how you play.
---
They should've just put it in the shop for everybody. Its a weak reward. But as most are pointing out its not even different enough to warrant buying...so don't buy it and support the move.
---
What rumors? They said one of the benefits of fallout first is discounts in the atomic shop. Hardly something to complain about.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if they added it one of these days. Could help pass the time until wastelanders.
---
Unfortunately if anyone says anything bad about this game a lot of people in this subreddit lose their shit 😂
---
This posted just turned into a bunch of bullshit. I'm done with it. I forget no one on reddit acts like an adult.
---
I recognize all those names, and they don't even need to 180 to one shot you because their hacks just let them fire straight into the air and you die automatically.  They have infinite stamina and jump height multiples over frog legs so they just run a circuit around the map shooting into the air until everyone is dead.
---
definitely. it's just a guy saying unverifiable stuff on the internet. but in that regard he's no different than Bethesda at this point. if anything at least he got the paid 1st skins part right.
---
&gt;which was suspiciously absent while he was covering Anthem
---
I don't quite remember a point in time when Fo76 wasn't outrageous. it's been one fiasco after another since release.
---
Scavenger bot at vending machine 
---
What will he buy?
---
Lmao Bethesda blatantly taking advantage of these fallout 1st subscribers. Makea me laugh at the people who defend this shit
---
7.99 for one report pack
---
if anything he got the part about paid 1st skins right.
---
it would have been nice if they had brought the poodle skirt and hip glasses back when they brought back the vampire costume. it would still be nice for a limited time run.
---
I don't think you have ever seen a war between the enclave and brotherhood then. If you have a halfway decent player with a good gun you can double it no problem in a war
---
Well the sign says weapons.. maybe he just cant wait until you die of natural causes to get those bone shards..  lol
---
why would you ever need extra steel scrap tho? thats like the most basic component you always find imo. (maybe its because i scrap a lot of weapons)
---
I used to roleplay as Father Shadow, he preached the 76 commandments of the almighty father to the sinners of Appalachia and cleansed the planet of demons.
---
Haven't noticed this, but is probably a bug. When vending went live putting things in your vendor counted against camp budget as well as stash. They fixed that one, hope they fix this one.
---
The Monkey's Paw grants your wish: no more free icons, they are now all 500+ atoms and you must be subscribed to Fallout 1st for them to be viewable by other users.
---
I loved the event.  As a non builder and non collector I banked a lot of caps selling the pirate outfits and WS jumpsuits.  Used it to buy other stuff like ammo.
---
I sing to my cats...
---
thats a self sustainable system right there. you need scrap to make bullets and use the same bullets to find scrap.
---
Can't miss what I never played, didn't like the fact that you dropped aid items upon death and people camping @ train station for the effortless kills for undeserved glory.
---
I have a video, already sent it to bethesda. His floor was literally made up of meat cleavers.
---
Pretty silly offer, honestly, because using it means you can't place your camp in pubic worlds anymore. It would actually hurt your ability to play, and prevent you getting to do public events. Not well thought out, but we passed that station long ago.
---
Nothing wrong with artists
---
Just Bethesda doesn't get that nobody wants skins for the fucking pickaxe
---
tell me about it. with meat week i wanted the tenderizer SO BAD and never got it. doing the event 10 times a day (even just starting the game every hour to quickly do it) 
---
then when the event came back some time later i got it the first (and only) time i participated lol
---
I am interested in buying several mutation serums for personal use. Could someone point me to a PS4 vendor who might help me out, please?
---
One time heard a girl crying on this guys mic saying she was freaking out about not being able to pay her bail and wanted to divorce this guy but wouldn’t be able to pay the legal fees or even rent for her own place. Dude told her to stfu that he was busy playing. Worst was I heard a little kid asking them to stop fighting in the background. I just had to take a minute and collect myself to what I just heard. I had to message him to say I could hear them and it just immediately stopped. Most awkward moment I’ve ever had in gaming.
---
Intriguing. So about 1/5 people here are idiots...
---
Yes! He is being a cat and leaving you gifts on the doorstep!
---
Yeah, and the Desert Ranger variant will probably come last for all those people who love the Survivalist in Honest Hearts.
---
I'm beginning to think updating my game would be a waste of time.
---
Not true , I don't cheat and I own . In NW and adventure I run servers lol I'm a raider and all I got to say is get wrecked NOOB lol!
---
If you want to get technical the game has always been pay to win, go to eBay and you can literally buy whatever you want.
---
The skins you buy for Backpacks at the Atomic Shop can be applied to any character, but the knowledge of *how to craft* the Backpack has to be learned for each, unfortunately. 
---
The good news is that they did add a Small Backpack plan you can learn by reaching the Overseer Cache at Morgantown Airport.  It doesn't offer nearly the capacity, but it's better than nothing.  That said, I don't believe you can apply the skins to it, for some bizarre and surely counterintuitive reason.
---
Yup can confirm.. thiss happened to me. Just had to re equip them in the atom store
---
Ah, asking the developers to get their shit together. Bold.
---
In Quotes. Meaning not necessarily pay to win, but stuff that shouldn't be behind a paywall.
---
Why are you still subbed to a game that you "gave up on"?
---
Lol at fo76 being a AAA game. If you told me bethesda janitors made it on their breaks, id believe you.
---
Oh, I don't know...After GlaDOS I have thicker skin for an AI insulting me.
---
Considering private worlds are only 8 people compared to the usual 20 or so, sorta makes sense that they’d ease up on limits like camp size because there would be more server resources available to those 8 players.
---
that's why we have democracy.. or in this case mob rule which is kind of the same. there are simply more people pissed off than happy about this.
---
Anything but battle royal right?
---
Fallout 4 multiplayer would be better. They wouldn’t release a half-baked mod that’s full of paid content.
---
Here's my take on this: The server can handle a bigger CAMP budget on the private servers because those servers are limited to 8 players. That alone greatly reduces the server load in rendering all that CAMP stuff. The bigger question is, once these bigger CAMP budgets are allowed, will the FO1st members be able to still play on public servers?
---
true
---
At this point it is a lost cause IMO. I just hope that this mess hasn't delayed, or entirely stopped development of FO5. I also hope that BGS realizes that they need to keep the Single Player experience as it is and not decide to do something like require that any and all MODS be digitally signed and only install-able via the Creation Club. If that happens I'm not sure there will ever be a Fallout 6.
---
People always complain about chewing, breathing, whatever, but it's worth it a million times over to hear people do weird shit.
---
Nah. They already did develop anti-cheat. It's called Fallout First and the anti-cheat is private Realms. Only, what, $13 a month?
---
That’s where my damn proboscis  went to! I knew I wasn’t crazy!!!!
---
You don't need to have every skin
---
Right.
---
Keep telling yourself we are the idiots....
---
It's really not.
---
Its only gonna be pay to win, when they have stuff that give u an advantage in the atom shop
---
Bethesda Rep:
---
*Hey, thanks for bringing this to our attention. I'll be sure to bring this up to the devs!* **Goes back to playing Fortnite**
---
Just to ban everyone that uses the anticheat, under the guise of “3rd party software”
---
Small group ruins it for all, ruin meaning...expect more paywalls. Pretty sure this would reflect the entire gaming industry quite accurately. Any extra income these companies can grab...expect they are trying to. They are going to try to milk you(take your money for nothing...) before they feed you(make deep content) to keep you alive.
---
and 1/50 voted "what is fallout first?" wtf... lol
---
It's now the time for the Fallout 76 Apologists and PR shills to come out of the woodwork
---
If that isn't licking boots I dont know what is, not to be mean, or hate, but... what lol
---
I wouldn't bother being offended, people are salty about what BGS did for sure. I think it might have been different if they had been upfront with their intentions but instead they kept it quiet and I suspect it is precisely because they knew it would crush sales. I see this model going the way DDO did.
---
Isnt that random chance to spawn though?
---
If the Fallout franchise dies here, it deserved to.
---
I'm more curious to see how much of Bethesda reputation overall has been tarnished.
---
Almost 20% is alot, lets say there are 250,000 players 17%, that is around $40,000 - $50,000. This will likely go up after wastelanders and the holiday season. The method for them should be get the game into as many hands as possible, and let the money flow in. (This is just from 1st, not other forms of income such as sales or atomic shop)
---
Pretty sure having unlimited space for Junk is a pretty big advantage. Especially since they said the current stash limit couldn't be raised without screwing up the servers.
---
Can't wait for that.
---
I think someone is over compensating
---
I know what you mean.  In addition to my bug parts, I lost some Red Star Pins and a number of other semi-rare scrap items I'd intended to sell or display.  Not a devastating loss, but annoying.
---
21% is not a small group.
---
Doesn't work from in game menus, at least on ps4
---
So a few things. He cannot win three games in a row as level 0, because winning a game earns you enough Overseer XP to level up past level 2. Winning 3 games in a row is not particularly difficult, my PS4 mates and I routinely go on 7 win streaks or higher, and we all have smurfs (I have four characters, for instance). Lastly, running around with your gun sheathed is common as it gets rid of stamina regeneration penalties.
---
Idiots? For deciding how to spend our money? If you dont like it dont buy it. Simple. There is no need for that childish mindset.
---
Yea scraper works on them and yea people just break them down and craft ammo for sure. People are acting like running west tek is efficient but these dudes are getting a couple hundred cleavers in 20 seconds! I don’t know how to do it and dont want/need to but I agree with you, it’s definitely a good way to get free steel!
---
I was blown away when I found out that the subscription gets you an exclusive green paint job you can buy for $5.
---
Yeah I dont go out much so I can give quest to people, because it I die I go to another server.
---
Considering we've lived before it. Its literly not important
---
Aw, but did they say anything offensive in-game?
---
You can do private NW!? Pog
---
Beat me to it. Don't forget it's also broken.
---
Why don't people use PTT?
---
Bethesda only cares about monetization.
---
 Bethesda only cares about monetization.
---
That's funny because people have been working on a skyrim mod for years that allows 4 friends to play together and still to this day it crashes every 5 minutes. Why don't you hater just quit being assholes and go away?
---
I insist you keep singing.
---
I'm pretty sure it's about having exclusive rewards for a holiday event on a side mode.
---
Why in the fuck us anyone still playing this game?
---
Sucks I have to run around my camp deciding what items needs to be deleted so I can add new items I’ve discovered or obtained. The vending really put me over
---
I think it’s fun and it’s nice to play that role with others. It would be nice if we had roleplay servers!
---
You are a idiot. Why follow the subreddit if you hate it? Oh yea that's right because you want to be an asshole to everyone that does.
---
Precursor to their argument about cap prices on Fixers at camps. Wait for that doozy.
---
This game is perfectly set up for in game collectables and fun world bosses and nice repeatably content and so far they are fucking failing.
---
although bethesda's decision is the cause of my growing cancer with their greedy shit, i suppose milking them out works 
---
i got fallout 1st for a month, pay2win as fuck, but it is enjoyable knowing the whole world is to yourself and items usable in pubic servers...
---
I know this has been said on here I’m sure but after seeing that dumb ass edit you did I had to come to comment. Just because your oblivious to your surroundings and haven’t seen people duping mines and cleavers doesn’t mean you have to throw a fit about being completely wrong about your accusations. It should of said this, EDIT: sorry I guess I was WRONG and I just never saw it until now.  Sorry for trying to fan the flames of hatred.
---
Explain how in the motherfuck this is taking advantage of people?
---
Ah thank you! Do you know if it charges the full subscription? Or another month?
---
Not true. I don't play the game, and I'm still here, because if the game turns around, I wanna know.
---
Someone being a dick doesn't make the game not bad
---
Wait, has the modding community actually been making QOL mods for the game?
---
(I play on Xbox, but very little, not my type of game even though I've put thousands of hours into the others)
---
You've not seen the famous USS Enterprise CAMP then? Same spot.
---
Damn rly? Thx for clarified that
---
More camp budget in private worlds. Which, when you go over, they're not gonna delete your camp and make you rebuild it, it'll still be there.
---
What? I’m just stating a fact.
---
Did he have the tesla rifle? That can actually kill a group of people standing next to each other. Also with teams of 4 why were a majority of the teams standing next to each other not doing anything? Sounds weird to me
---
They are “taking the wait and see approach”
---
TNT dome spawn for paint plans is from doing each quest. It’s always in exact same place and no other plan spawns there except for them, T51 Nuka paint and the X-01 Nuka paint.
---
I’ve been there daily and haven’t taken anything and rooms look different each time and this is on a private server. 
---
Spawn rates has to be random even on static spawns even if no one is taking them. 
---
I look at it like going to a robot vendor or graham... I’ll see different items than you.
---
Pretty sure the modding community made a text chat mod for the game.
---
I just find it funny that people are surprised by it, considering that they said they were going to do this when Fallout 1st came out. But what's truly baffling is that there's people that still support it.
---
Lol there isn't text chat on PC?
---
That's horrid
---
No it’s a stupid glitch were you throw one and like 75 poor out onto the ground. BUT people have been doing this with mines and cleavers for a long time. Way before 1st was available.
---
Without looking...
---
You want a quad railway. Preferably with ffr &amp; fr.  Any quad will do, but that unicorn railway is the best gun on the game.   No joke.
---
Once on elder scrolls online in the middle of one of the cities at least 30 people got to hear this guy get confronted by his girl friend for having a dating app profile. I believe his his dating app profile name was pimpdiggity. It was hilarious!
---
Wait modders can fix the game too their like helpers and they should get paid like 10$ a month u know but that's what Fallout 1st is for I like it honestly🙂
---
Especially for PC, seems like they're being wrecked by cheaters in Nuclear Winter, I could see cheating in these game modes for sure so some kind of anticheat would be wonderful.
---
Woops. Need to unequip my life-saver armor.
---
Sure, thats just 24,99€ in your exclusive deal, only accessible for our most valueable Fallout 1st members!
---
no just a bug
---
17% of the people playing 76 atm got milked...mooooo!
---
No yeah i know we didnt get told much or about the subscription service or utility stuff et cetera, i was just saying I thought I remembered somebody asking them during a press conference at E3 if they’d been working on camp budget increases or something to that effect and they said they’d been thinking of ways to do that on private servers. But again, I could be completely misremembering
---
Hi everyone! We're hearing your feedback on Nuclear Winter maps, and we know that being able to play on both Flatwoods and Morgantown is important to many of you. While I don't have many details to share on this right now, we are definitely planning to give you increased opportunities to play on both maps in the future. Keep an eye out for more info on this in a future update!
---
Ciclejerking to imitate their masters at Bethesda
---
Don't be sleeping on my Emergency Protocols, bro.
---
I hate this. But not as much as clicking to fast travel to have nothing happen. 😒 I don't have any generators like that now, so I don't notice it as much anymore.
---
That worked, brilliant! Thank you very much!
---
Bruh this is kind of true
---
Totally underrated comment here!! 🤣🤣
---
Refrigerated backpack does plenty, I don't see the need to pay Bethesda for something that should be in game imo.
---
Or you can shoot it down, I use a lever action w/scope
---
You mean atoms.
---
Likewise.... can’t seem to get it to function properly
---
The job is done, cheers for the offers and of course, the help, I owe you guys one!
---
No. Some things work, they aren't supposed to, but not that one.
---
No problem, sorry about the goofs. I don't know how I survived the fall twice in a row. Haha.
---
I don't care, but you miss the point.  Millions of people buy skins in the various games they play.  They wouldn't agree that it's nonsense.
---
It's completely their choice to spend their money on what suits them.
---
Wondered what was going on too, starting thinking did we need a higher building to throw you off!
---
off topic question but where are the cement tire walls? did I miss them and they're in the vault now?
---
Yeah it’s likely this survey was completed by a lot of people who have never played the game but want to skew the results. All I see is robot dancing NCR rangers with scrap boxes when I play lately lol. I didn’t get the sub myself but I have nothing against it, I’m just not into the aesthetic stuff more so the player builds etc... so it just doesn’t have anything for me.
---
the sample size is actually largely sufficient to have something statistically representative **of this subreddit subscribers** (as opposed to actual players, even if the two groups actually combine to some degree).
---
Where did I say I subbed?
---
I know it sounds crazy, I'm just saying thats what would have to happen.  unlikely as it seems.
---
You just WON, ma-dude! 
---
Congratulations! You just bought the most game winningest, unfairly overpowered item. In. The. Game!
---
How does it feel to crush all of your fellow players with giant refrigerator feet? It feels gooooood, right?
---
I commented on this [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drx109/put_both_maps_in_the_rotation_for_nw/f6nmqvi/), but wanted to drop by this thread to let you know that we're hearing your feedback on this.  Please keep it coming!
---
Honestly it's barely a game doesn't do much to make anyone who enjoys it think you are being honest. It sucks because the community has to deal with trolls non stop who just come on here to shit on the game. I don't know that you play it or paid for it but I do know there are people who really enjoy what you think is barely a game. So it would be nice if you cut it out. If you really give a shit about it then you should be able to tell real quick the amount of trolls on this subreddit who obviously don't and instead are only on here to troll people who like a multi-player fallout game.
---
They are doing a really bad job of putting stuff in the main tiles. The cosmos one only has 3 things. I'm wondering if they are doing that 'add a thing per day' thing again 😞
---
I moved my camp earlier and it was working fine at my old camp.
---
Or when they add it to the atom shop for 2000 atoms next month....this time in blue....(Green not available in all areas. Costume may not actually glow in some light. Bethesda is not responsible for any costumes that do not fit or clip with other accessories.)
---
Just jealous of the PREMIUM money vacuum Bethesda has set up for members of the super cool exclusive club.
---
nm. Pippin\_Dreadful helped me out. Thank you!
---
The way you converted this reminded me of a time someone was giving statistics about something really negative and said only 5% engage in this activity. I replied with “1 out of 20” seems like a lot of people.”  They spend the next hour arguing with me telling me I was saying 1/20 to seem more dramatic and 1/20 isn’t the same as 5% lol. Basic math is lost on some.
---
It’s useless, but I didn’t buy it for function. I bought it so I can have it rusting in my yard. The game is set in West Virginia after all. :p
---
Ideally I was thinking all the redeemable cards would come out as 1 stared cards and trading and gaining other cards would be the way you would upgrade them. 
---
While yes having all the new idea cards come in various stars would be better. Having them at base star would encourage getting more through any means. 
---
You can as always combine perk cards but the new stuff should be done at the card station I mentioned.
---
John wick has entered the game
---
if they were really your friends they would help you for free
---
Now I am thoroughly confused....I logged on and my health bar was at 25% and rads at 75%...I took a toxic goo and went to 80/20 and my carry weight is at 380 again....No radaway, no chems, just mutations and perk cards....I just do not get why I run at 405-455 carry weight for certain periods of time....Any suggestions appreciated...
---
Move your camp unit around. You generally spawn at the north edge of the circle from where your camp unit is sitting
---
Nothing worse when morons who are stood in game with kids so blaring in the background, or their family members talking or animal noises. Mute you’re fucking microphone you smack heads. I understand theirs a block feature but still.. how can people be so dumb.
---
I’m sorry you are still experiencing a buggy game. Outside of mischief night I hadn’t disconnected in months and things run dramatically smoother. Others I play with aren’t experiencing issues anymore either.
---
I’ve tried and it doesn’t work. I’ve had it at a different spot and same thing.  One time it actually worked, but then others who fast traveled to my camp went in water.
---
The sad truth.
---
Ideas aren't for the game, they're for the Atomic Shop and only for people willing to pay.  Not for everyone else.
---
Make a new one, completely different. It feels like a different game, sometimes.
---
If player camps with public vendors are anything to go by damn near everyone has subscribed. On PC.
---
True, hope people do that as it's fairly easy to do
---
It also doesn’t account for those who did not get the sub immediately but intend to in the future.
---
I've spoken to people mid game that get disconnected, trying to make trades and trying to team up, granted you don't disconnect as much as a few months ago, but disconnections are more often than if you had shitty internet
---
I thought we were supposed to spawn near our vending machine, but everyone spawns in the back of my house.
---
I need real, serious evidence to support this one. In my experience, if you cripple her, she lands. It Is the only sure thing. And sometimes, even if nobody shoots her, she just stays flying.
---
Besides, having a herbivore/carnivore and letting stuff and flux spoil is a much better way of keeping food and water on you at low weight.
---
Yup lol
---
Are you gatekeeping the Fo76 subreddit? Even though im using it correctly, to ask a question involving the game. 
---
You are sad.
---
I'm sorry :'(
---
I mean why not, right? These people are very open to spending money, why not fleece them for more?
---
For the life off me I don't know why they don't have toilet and bathtubs that aren't fucked to hell.
---
Since its release I never bought it and never noticed not having it affecting any game play.
---
Not at all sure what's the purpose of other than it causing one to just waste more time.
---
Let's me honest here. It's all semantics anyhow. Nothing is micro with the microtransactions in the Atom Store.
---
It’s busted
---
Only works with the flip switch
---
Broke my whole camp with that shit
---
Had one entry door with the key pad, had to rework everything to include a side door as a work around -_-
---
It's pretty rare for anyone with a Tesla to get close enough to kill me ever since they nerfed the range.  My sniper build let's me kill well from range and my aim isnt too shabby on PC.
---
Yeah it is
---
Fuck... they backed down and made it free.
---
I did a Line In The Sand event with a guy that had his mic on. He was blasting Whitesnake - Here I Go Again while blowing shit up with a rocket launcher the whole time. Was awesome.
---
Easily the coolest guy I've randomly come across. Gave him a thumbs up emote and went to search for my red asylum dress after the event.
---
Shit, they backed down and made it free...
---
Ive never seen this happen.  What platform?
---
I don’t really have any problems with the game. At 600 hours I’m looking forward to new quests with wastelanders. I’m a little afraid that it will somehow lose the multiplayer feel with all the instancing but we’ll see how they execute. I’d also like to see more maps in NW that rotate each playthrough and the ability to spend more time exploring vault 51.
---
As of right now. Items that go missing cant be recalled unless you move the whole camp.........
---
You know... it just works....
---
So you want to take our ideas and make money off them through ad revenue? How Bethesda of you.
---
What? 
---
PC? I've never seen this happen on XB.
---
Ha! It's funny because it costs money. 
---
Give this kid the Platinum.
---
I think the surprise is how pathetic the first exclusive atom shop item is.
---
Costume vs armor.
---
He smells scrap
---
Who cares? Don’t buy it then... Save your atoms for something else.
---
It’s like the statues in Elder Scrolls Online, you can only get them with ESO+ which nobody seems to have been upset about when they first started doing that.. you never know they might release these outfits to non-subscribers for significantly more than $5 later down the line
---
Seems like you care.
---
I fucking wish dude, I have 25 subs, and am nowhere close to monetization
---
Can you imagine how itchy that is?
---
Macrotransactions are the new microtransactions.
---
Aside from the Fallout 1st drama the game is in a decent enough place for a new player, IMO.
---
I dropped the game about a week after launch and came back in early October. I've had a lot of fun.
---
Now actually is a decent enough tone to come back. If you're not having fun wait for wastelanders.
---
Not sure why the paint is costing some people 500 atoms. It was listed as free for me.
---
Oh well. All the best with the video then. Make sure to post it here when you're done.
---
Thanks for the info. I was planning on using them as exterior stairs to my base, but will now look at my camps to see if it’s worth it. What’s the other item if you don’t mind me asking?
---
I really don’t... I don’t have a subscription. I don’t see the big deal i complaining about a digital outfit that you can just not buy if you don’t like it. It’s a video game.
---
You might imagine that, but in the real world radiation protection means tons of lead.  To keep it short -- no, a real spacesuit gives no radiation protection at all.
---
Could be neat, but they need to make them work with hats first
---
I'd agree if it wasn't reposted. People may have responded to the first but not.the second. Obviously the general vibe here is that 1st is bad. 
---
There's Les overlap in this forum and players than most naively think. There's other subs with their own culture. Which can't be discussed here for whatever shitass reason. But even the hardcore community is much larger than this particular sub.
---
The skin was free for me. Not sure if they changed it in the past few hours or what but I got it for nothing.
---
ah ok cool ..
---
lol must of been a site to see ..  although I must say probably not his fault, unlimited stash and unlimited meat cleavers ... how fun ..
---
I guess they are reasoning that the scrap box wouldn't negatively affect server stability much since not everyone on a server will own Fallout 1st.
---
best comment I've read all day :P
---
Which is a bannable offense, RMT(Real Money Trading.)
