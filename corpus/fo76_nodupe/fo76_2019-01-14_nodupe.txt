I was chatting with a new friend just tonight and he told me the same thing, these two guys just came up and one shot him over and over.   Pacifist  mode needs to work both ways Dev's.  But wait let's stealth Nerf Technical data spawns.  Good call Dev's..

Fixed a way to do it. You can still do it, but its tedious, and requires you be near an armor bench every time you log out.
---
You seem like the toilet drinker. Paying stupid money for a broken, recycled cash grab that has nothing but bugs.
---
I, on the other hand, haven’t spent a penny and play a bug free game with regular updates and developers who give a shit. How am I the toilet drinker here again?
---
Max agility and more from mutations, I have about 19 with no buffs. I also have a full set of faster AP refresh armor

4.  So on multiple occasions myself and many friends have either dropped or scraped armor that was currently being used. I have lost multiple pieces of armor but the two occasions that were the most annoying was loosing an excavator power armor leg with calibrated shocks during a nuke zone as well as tonight loosing a weightless Marine left arm. {Not asking for the armor back just asking to prevent equipped armor from being removed from inventory possibly by adding the ability to lock items so that you must unlock said item before dropping or scrapping and possibly trading}
---
5. N/A
---
Why not just log out???? Or die
---
I know I just had a couple lower level armor pieces and when I tried to drop them the selection moved to the chassis and it was too late to pick it back up. Thanks though 
---
I’ve kinda wanted to role play a doctor 
---
Dang that sucks man. Hopefully their next few patches sort this all out.
---
All the dupers panicking and duping like crazy would be my guess
---
Nice
---
So me having some loose pieces of marine armor is what’s causing this, by what you’re telling? If so that’s actually a super obnoxious glitch.
---
Could be Xbox but another server
---
Yeah.  it is getting annoying but I am just going to keep enjoying this game.
---
...Show me. 
---
Sure falling through floors I have never had it happen or seen anyone from my discord fall through the floor since beta
---
I really enjoy this game there r downfalls but really fun to play with friends
---
This is Yongyea's video? If so, this was lazy content from him. 
---
He bashed Bethesda for someone hacking/exploiting their way into the room.
---
Could Bethesda done something about it so that it wasn't easy to get in, sure. Notice in the video NOTHING negative was said about the people who got into that room.
---
Also the end too. Sanctimonious scumbag.
---
I've seen some cheap blows from Yongyea before about other issues but this one was just embarrassing.
---
thx.
---
Lmao youngyea is scraping for content
---
Are you on Xbox by any chance?  I have the outfit but want the plan so I can make more and we can team run in it. LOL.  GT - Amber 71 Stars   Not sure what you want to trade for.  I can make a few things.  Marine Tactical Helmet....Resistant BOS Knight underarmor.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
FYI I was able to purchase the witches costume off the traveling Responder Bot one of the two times I have ever seen it spawn. 
---
The game wouldn’t let me access any menus, I have gear that auto-stimpacks, I tried closing the application only to resume in the same spot, then after finally dying and losing all my stimpacks I was respawned in the same area lol.
---
Eventually I was able to get out but I lost all the stimpacks I had.
---
Doh, I did a player search not a F76 on a server.
---
How the fuck would you know you have not played it and fortnite the game for little kids who cant handle a grownups game
---
it's still really, really messy and thin.  servers the opposite of stable.
---
there's fun in it, i play it like a crack addict, but it has a long, long way to go.
---
As someone who plays this game I am very happy someone like you is not part of the playerbase
---
They just said last week that its coming lol
---
Well go figure, a bunch of white knighting cockbags being cockbags. I feel your pain, these asshats are every where now, not only trying to kill people they think are duping, but stealing what was dropped as well, as if them taking it is justified. 
---
Apparently the witch-hunting rule here doesn't matter unless people are named specifically. These jackoffs remind me of the witch hunters from Witcher 3, which is probably why I kill both of them, equally in both games.
---
Put that power armour on an owned frame and wait for it to auto recall, should save up some space
---
if bethesda wants me to write a fucking essay about something they should have included from the start, then i'll take those odds
---
I swear like half the people play it just to enjoy it, and the other half is split between cheaters and gatekeepers
---
Im fairly certain youtube is no longer about this place where you can post your opinions and get some original stuff going.
---
Nope sensationalism like in newspapers is what gets the droves attention. 
---
As a result I dont watch youtube for others opinions anymore.
---
Correct....
---
The Bethesda Reddit account recently said that they are aware of the request for this change in the game. Hopefully it will appear in a patch soon.
---
My enclave under armor gives me 3 str and 2 per. [here’s the stats of all of them](https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a40ifp/questions_underarmor_and_linings/) 
---
Perhaps the discussion isn't so much about the PvP itself, but why would they add a pacifist mode to a game with PvP our they didn't want people to be able to decide if they wanted to engage or not. 
---
To not is to accept to be griefed? 
---
I try to find rare things.  pretty thin game play really :(
---
started a heavy alt, kind of fun.
---
Depends.  If they are not legendary, toss em.
---
If they are legendary 1 stars, toss em unless they are 2-shot or explosive.
---
If they are legendary 3 stars and the perks don't all suck, keep em.
---
When it gives you that message and its not scheduled, it means the server your own basically borked and is shutting down.
---
  
---
Had it happen when a duper had me locked up every few seconds for like 20 minutes. Slowly but surely got through fast travels and loading screens to get to him. After I started freaking him out he bailed, but not before a server maintenance timer started.
---
Relogged and was in a new server just fine.
---
I very well could be. The lever was given to me by a guy that said no one was buying it and he needed to free up the weight from his stash. I was a level 50 something at the time he was 150 something, I dont recall the exact numbers. I figured he was helping me out, me being much lower level. I posted a list of plans I was trying to sell along with my request for a TSE handmade, guy messaged me and said he would trade me a handmade for the BoS plans, which were selling for around 1k each at the time so it technically cost me 3k caps of potential sale value. There isnt really a way to tell 100% though if someone is duping or not, unless they have 1000s of obvious items like bobbles. Even if they look legit they could be using an alt character to store all the duped stuff and just sell a couple at a time. Hopefully they just fix the exploits and find a way to reset the dupers inventories or something.
---
**Shop closes in 2 hours**
---
 you only get 5, the maximum per hour is if you regularly get water 
---
Only keep what I can use or use very soon. Sell everything else. Doesn't matter what it is or how high level. By the time I get to that level, odds are I can easily get that item again, or in the case of legendaries, get similar or better ones.
---
Loadouts, baby! I equip the CAMP specific perks when I get back to mine, swapping for the armor/dmg ones.
---
Agreed! My main is lvl160, decided to start another character today. I'm in flatwoods at lvl4, with some lvl104 guy just running about the place. Anyway as soon as I hit lvl5, he's bashing the crap outta me, I ignore him, and wonder off. He starts to follow me trying to hit me, I just run around him and carry on, raise and repeat, leading him up to toxic valley and back down just north of the overseers camp, where I encounter someone's camp. I run around it a couple of times, he pulls out some explosive automatic and starts spraying the place, clips this camp, gets a 10 cap bounty, than suddenly logs out. Also my first ever grifter.
---
I would know because of the constant stream of posts and videos of different bugs and fuck ups from this game.
---
That last bit made sound like you got your head caved in with a brick. It is indeed played by little children but people of all ages are permitted to play. 
---
You've never transported to a friends camp and fallen through floor??? You must be one lucky mf cuz it happens all the time to me. At various camps as well
---
I haven't played in weeks. When someone comes into your area/event &amp; instantly one shots everything it sucks all the fun out of the experience. What's the reason to even continue playing at that point?
---
And speaking of cool stuff to wear anyone else find the engineers suit?
---
where did you find the first Jesu's Sunday holotape? Is the only one Im missing and I can't find it
---
Amazing idea! You've inspired me
---
“I’ve never had any experience with it but it’s bad and my opinion on an online forum is valid”
---
Holy damn. What a bunch of braindead sheeplets you are. Kissing that Bethesda's ass and licking up that shit. 
---
it is upgradeable and still wearable while using the chameleon perk.
---
also the eye of ra supposedly make the voice of set, and blade of bastet better.
---
i personally wouldn't know since i accidentally scrapped those weapons and there is literally no way of getting them again.
---
I may add you on my Xbox account and bounce back and forth.
---
Np, thanks for the list, it's great
---
It doesnt work 90% of the time for me. Recently built a nice new camp and had a spawn point down the hill so I moved my camp around til I spawned right in the middle of the house. Tried to get my friends to come and they spawn in the foundation and get stuck until I move stuff out of the way (same spawn point regardless of them using my camp or fast travelling to me). Tried moving it around again and they get the same spawn point every time I move my camp but mine did change, that is until I left the original server. Now mine is back to the original spot down the hill and moving my camp 90% of the time doesnt change it so I moved it back to where the inside of the house spawn was at and every now and then I get a normal spawn but usually it doesnt work.
---
Unfortunately, I am not confident for this one... and I really would like to be, because the feature is seriously missing in the game...
---
But dx injectors are the entry point for absolutely everything including hack, so, even if this one is safe (the modder is well known), this seems to be a step too far for an online game, Imho.
---
Reshade and sweet fx have well known memory signatures, this mod will be is unknown for a while.
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer is this okay? Because I want it bad. 
---
I agree with you drakkensong everyone who has seen this picture should get banned, we're all accountable now. Unless you work for BGS we can't be trusted.
---
I’m going to try nonPA in rad zones by not using radiation to limit my health to 20% while in there. 
---
I’ll cure it entirely, wear the 7rads/sec that 300+ RR armor without the magic juju gets you to gives, and heal radiation to nil with full strength radaway a periodically, 
---
Health will be managed using dilluted stims to bring up (10% at a time) and enemies whacking me to come down, trying to keep it between 9% and 19%. 
---
I’ll be using barbarian, evasive, white knight and serendipity. 
---
I don't really understand the respawn mechanics as you explain them. I've found that if you run a specific circuit, within a nuked zone, you get about 70-100% respawns. This has been the case in nuke sites besides whitesprings.
---
I had a level 1 appear out of thin air and attack me from above...just pounced on me. Luckily it was just a level 1 but damn did that give me a scare.
---
I hope it helps. 
---
Visit the subreddit, and there should be 3 dots in the top right. Click that, then select change user flair (on mobile, should be similar for desktop)
---
Several days of searching and I've still not seen them spawn at the vendor terminal yet, but the quest continues!
---
Would quite like Rad Scrubbers too, but those are another thing that hasn't yet appeared.
---
you seem autistic, screeching reeee for something you didnt even try, foul language like any self respecting 12 year old toiletdrinking fortniter would do.
---
sure you didnt spent a penny since your parents dont give a shit about you and your games, and therefore have closed their wallets for you.
---
thats why youre probably here, venting all that anger and trolling around for some attention.
---
do you also go into mcdonalds cursing at people that they should go to kfc'a since in your head its a better place?
---
nevermind, dont give a shit about your lunacy, piss off and be blocked, now proceed on with your reeee shit
---
For the purposes of those badges, it's just selecting them as 'flair'.
---
People have done tests. There's an upper limit to how much water you can create. Adding more water purifiers won't get you above that number. Maybe that's your issue?
---
I'm not familiar with the game, but is there a system that discourages griefing? The griefer gets a bounty or something after killing enough innocent people?
---
Thanks for the reply. Heard anything about it getting fixed or workarounds? Game just crashed so maybe a religious will help. 
---
Seriously? That's not even that much if you pick up everything. How did you know he was duping? You have proof you sent to bethesda? Or did you just say they had "a bunch of mats." 
---
They may have been building weapons to scrap for mods and you screwed them over.
---
Ahhh ok gotcha thank you, you are a gentlemen and a scholar!
---
Is that why the wikis are bare compared to other FO titles?
---
I don't know this guys stuff other than what has been linked here on reddit but holy shit is he a muckraker. Was his content ever anything other than harping on old news while providing no information himself?
---
I think your better of just posting it up and getting it in the open and forcing this to become a real world effecting issue to force Bethesda to do 'emergency maintenance'.  If there is legit mass server crashing going on, I think that will spur them to really get all hands on deck and figure something out.  
---
Granted they might really get the ban hammer going for ppl using it causing the servers to crash like that and understandably so with the brand hit that will stack on to their already tarnished public view here, but even on XB1 I had two complete differnet whole server disconnects to me last night with 3 others players in a xbox party (so the server went down) and this sounds suspiciously like what may be the cause.
---
I had a Deathclaw that would always be in my house, he was oddly set to perma-passive and wouldn't even attack critters. I tested it with a super low Radrat once and he almost died till I stepped in. he sadly just vanished one day, though now that I've found out about the bottom of the cliff thing it's likely he just teleported down there and I didn't notice. I only found out about it because I had a sloth and even though I never saw him I could hear it howl, so I tried to follow the noise and I found the spot. 
---
Good. Now go enjoy your Fortnite. :)
---
Hey man im about to get on 
---
Get a DPS weapon and a high per shot damage weapon. 
---
DPS is for short range
---
HPSD is for sniping
---
I have no issues. I died once in the last 7 levels. That was to a scorchbeast when I was overloaded. 
---
Cool. I’ll be on tomorrow after the console update completes. 
---
To add to this: Running around in the cranberry bog (from fissure to fissure) seemed to yeilding scorchbeast quickly too. Buddy and I got 9/10 commendations on scorchbeast alone.
---
Jesus Christ mate. Just read back what you commented. Are you sure I’m the autistic angry cunt?
---
False
---
when I die overencumbered at Whitespring golf house my only option to spawn is the Disposal ground up north, when the closest location would be the \*\*\*\*\* golfhouse I died in 
---
The only experience I've had so far with this sort of thing is some guy sent me a message on Xbox from across the map that just said
---
"I know your duping"
---
....I honestly don't even know how to dupe. Weird.
---
How do I start this quest 
---
Killed 6 3-star bloated glowing today in a 10 minute period. 
---
Got diddly for it (happy for the XP, though, since that's going away tomorrow).  Assassin's baseball bat or some nonsense.
---
Where did they say this?
---
Report the dude for being an arsehole in-game?
---
I know you shouldn't need to but this kind of shit is just as bad as duping, you're right. Even IF you are a duper, harrassment of this nature shouldn't be tolerated.
---
There's a way to deal with dupers. This is not it.
---
Not really I just forget to stim sometimes so having more dmg reduction lets me forget a little less about it
---
Congrats you've have won! PM me your ign name and I'll get you the price. Thanks for entering!
---
That sounds delightful! I wish you could set the bots on the bot building station to Mr. Gutsy voices.
---
Gee thanks! Now I want a pet radroach!!! Lol
---
Really? How do you get it back? The Wiki says you can’t remake it. 
---
I usually use the soundtracks from Westworld, also on Spotify BTW. Maybe give them a shot, all instrumental so no talking or singing to distract from anything
---
Is that limit six per hour? Because that's what I get on average. 
---
[removed]
---
PC! Sorry, hope it is still there! 
---
Do items that increase xp gains get doubled or not?
---
I've tried locking them with no notable difference. 
---
You grab another ruined dress and use the fabricator again.
---
"Muling gives you an unfair advantage to the people who didnt know to do that, because it's not a part of the game that was originally intended. So now you have an unfair equipment advantage over your average Joe who is playing the game as intended."
---
So do players who know how to complete a game puzzle have an unfair advantage over those who don't? Do players who spend time reading about ability effects, and how they can be used in-game, have an unfair advantage over those who weren't aware of certain ability effects or usage? Whether it was intended or not, this will inevitably happen in any MMO with inventories and multiple accounts. Developers each deal with it in their own ways, but acknowledge it can't be discouraged or properly punished because it's not an "exploit" per se. That doesn't mean players who utilize its existence are gaining an unfair advantage.
---
"Cmon man, anyone can get an aim-bot..."
---
Which provides an unfair advantage against people in PvP and directly affects other player's ability to enjoy or play the game.
---
"...or look up ways to do glitches but that doesn't mean it's not cheating."
---
Depending on the type of glitch, MMO developers can punish those caught doing it and patch it out. Muling is not something considered worth punishing, or investing money and effort into completely safeguarding against, because the impact it has on other players is negligible.
---
"The dev's gave each character set guidelines/restrictions to create a level playing field."
---
And where does it say "no muling"? You will never have a truly level playing field in an MMO, since people dedicate their time to activities that others avoid or ignore, due to difficulty or lack of enjoyment. In PvP you'll always have people with inferior gear/items because they didn't grind a particular raid for the best gear set for their build/class.
---
"When you mule and therefore have access to many more weapons/materials that the rest of us dont, that's an unfair advantage."
---
Why is it? You can do exactly the same, you just choose not to. That player also spent a similar amount of time accumulating that gear/materials that you would have to - it would be unfair if a player glitched the game to obtain them faster than everyone else.
---
"To what degree it actually helps is irrelevant because the fact remains you are working the system to get around restrictions."
---
Restrictions that Bethesda should be aware of that have been circumvented in every MMO in existence. MMO developers only go so far as to restrict muling, either by limiting character slots (and forcing players to buy extras with real cash or spending hours in game to accumulate the currency to purchase an extra slot), or forcing you to buy an extra licence per account. See above for reasons why.
---
"Look, I get it. Stash limits suck, so we find ways to work around them! I'm not trying to say you are a bad person, or a dishonest gamer or anything like that but this IS cheating."
---
I've offered a counter for why muling is not unfair and I don't consider it cheating. I understand where you're coming from but it's been considered an acceptable component of MMOs that no developer is overly worried about its existence in their game. Calling it unfair or the people who utilize it "cheaters" doesn't help the matter, instead debate the possible safeguards and improvements you would prefer to see, rather than calling for a blanket ban on anyone who utilizes it.
---
Muling gives players no immediate advantage in-game. In a PvP engagement, players can't just open up that mule inventory and pull out whatever best suits their needs. It's not a Bag of Holding.
---
"What you are effectively doing when you have a mule character is trading with yourself for free. "
---
As opposed to trading with friends for free, or for a profit? Muling is zero-sum. You gain nothing bar a few "extra" slots to your inventory.
---
"You have 2 separate characters exchanging goods but are both controlled by the same person. Shift that thinking to the stock market and it's called insider trading, and is against the law. Now I understand this is a VIDEO GAME and it DOESNT MATTER but what the dev's tried to do in 76 was create a player driven economy."
---
As most MMOs do, but muling doesn't net you a profit or artificially deflate the economy. If players who obtain a rare item choose not to sell it, therefore increasing demand and price, should they be pressured into selling it? Are they cheaters for holding on to an item that other players want? What about all these people walking around over-encumbered or giving items to friends to assist them? They're not feeding back into the economy, should they be punished?
---
I know I might be stretching but the stock market is completely different to how a virtual economy operates, and it's not going to crash because players mule items. There are dozens of examples where you can observe this not happening despite muling.
---
"Insider trading/duping/muling all jeprodize this ecosystem which is why we have stash limits and aren't able to transfer goods (easily, and with a game mechanic intend to be used for such things) between your own builds."
---
Then that's just poor design and is no fault of the player.
---
I've tried that before and it's literally never worked for me. 
---
Too late, sold mine. 
---
The shitty thing is, the current way it works with getting a quest given weapon: it only encourages people grind straight to level 50. "Only then do you finally get to enjoy the story!" (Which is total BS, I think the main quests are so much more fun at lower levels.)
---
Keep an eye on the Fallout Twitter :) They told us in the patch notes that the PC update was Thursday the 10th and console was Monday the 14th. 
---
Someone might be lucky.
---
i've tried locking them with no difference in results. 
---
Not
---
Enjoying your buyer's remorse tears
---
Lots of people are hoarders.  My stash box was full by lvl20
---
Well, color me corrected. 
---
beezelbubba
---
I prefer the Black Diamond for the strength buff, but the Blade of Bastet is a close third for me
---
I'm having the exact same issue. How do we even know if Bethesda responds to the help ticket? My account at [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) doesn't seem to have any kind of "mailbox."
---
Am I correct in thinking this pretty much makes the main quest impossible to finish? I really don't want to restart and have to redo 70+ hours of gameplay just to fix this.
---
Has anyone encountered an issue like this?  [https://youtu.be/Oy1Svylmoxk](https://youtu.be/Oy1Svylmoxk)
---
I'm over-powered at the moment, and I've tried locking them with no change in results. 
---
The updates been moved to Tuesday for consoles has it not?
---
People like this aren't bothering me at all in the game. Neither are dupers. People can do what they want, I only care if what they want is just to accuse and annoy me, or others.
---
Either the game is a problem, or you are. OP ain't bothering anyone, although a spoiler tag would have been nice.
---
Hell naw, watching your 4k ultra projection is where it’s at. It’s quite strange that mistake laughter as anger.
---
It’s quite clear at this point that you cover up personal failings by attributing them to others, I don’t know what they all are but I do know they include champion cherry picking and inability to handle adversity.
---
Do you actually enjoy life while being unable to have an honest conversation? Do you really feel so strong when you (try to) shut down a debate by berating and shouting because you can’t actually win one?
---
From posts a while back, the number was something like 13-14. Seems low but not sure if it's something that was introduced into recent patches.
---
Okay, but if I keep scrapping arms will I eventually learn mods?
---
Yup! You can also die like her a well if you have explosive weapons! Just like in that toxic ass game lol
---
Their Twitter has since come out and said *Tuesday.*
---
Just wanted to add to your comment so as not to confuse others.
---
I don't know if it is three star legendary enemkes or 5 *different* types of legendary enemies. It took me awhile of killing lots of legendaries without credit, but it did eventually unlock.
---
Correct
---
Scrap that shit for mods. You'll find more along the way.
---
Yes. It's a terrible image for a lot of reasons but OPs points are all that matters here - it isn't what shows up in the game.
---
It makes me sadly miss my sentinel PA each time I run into Mr Gutsy bots in F76 :(
---
I agree dupers should be punished severely but it's not the community's place to do it. Sure, I also enjoy the stories of dupers getting annihilated but allow Bethesda to handle it.
---
Damn.
---
Or parachute in far cry 5 style boiiii
---
Thanks! I forgot about that.
---
Which sub reddit? I have no flairs in the sub reddit?
---
I'd buy a working fridge, water tiles (for making a pond or pool), a porch roof set (you can't put a front porch roof on a two story brick house rn and it looks weird without it), a wood interior staircase, interior finished ceiling panels, brick house interior walls (white plaster on both sides), porch railings that match the brick house style (turned wood spindles). Also some dock related pieces like buoys, cleats, pilings, bumpers, etc for those of us who are using the foundation pieces to make piers/docks on our river/lake houses.
---
This quest is why I play the Fallout series. More of this is needed. 
---
I went in the other day and got max level stuff...but it doesn't shock me that Bethesda nerfed something to make it pointless...that's every balance change they've made as yet. "Let's make the game LESS FUN, and do NOTHING to improve it, beyond fixing bugs that shouldn't have been there to begin with". 
---
r/straightfortodd
---
To where we can add our own stuff?
---
Lol true, but that's how it should be Imho.  That's the whole point of leveling, to be stronger, which most games forget now a days lol.  Level up to be scaled to the same power as before you leveled!  That is why nobody liked FF8 when it was out, because enemies scaled to your level...but now it's the standard xD
---
Sent you a request, should be from "Nezedia"
---
This could explain why I've been killing an absurd amount of wanted players last two days. Especially today I couldn't open the map without seeing one or two wanted players.
---
So is this the new pvp mode they announced? lol
---
Yes
---
Really? I got so bored of it. Some of the side quests feel so drawn out.
---
Go there and do this and then comeback to here. Ok now go across the map to here for this, now come back. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Ok cool here’s a reward for your trouble.
---
I havent heard anything about it getting fixed. If you arent watching/listening carefully these mass extiction events can be mistaken for a 'cleaned out' area.
---
I approach it like this: it all depends on what Im looking for.
---
I dont mind if I hear the dreaded mass sighs of last breath mass extinction in the vicinty, when I need access to a facility or something in the area. Just means Im in and out faster.
---
However if its a group of something im looking to farm, e.g. bots- unfortunately you have to server hop.
---
And he gives you some dog food and a calmX for a reward ?
---
DEAD MONEY IS THE BEST
---
I’m telling you that’s where they will make their money is with camp stuff. Price them at around 500 atoms a piece and your golden. 
---
Ouch. That really sucks.
---
I don't get the point of having machines that produce "60 per hour" and having them actually produce 1/5'th of that or less. That's just...flat out false advertisement. 
---
I guess I shouldn't be shocked, everything else gets nerfed without proper information.

Free DLC at the cost of having only cosmetic cash shops is a very, very fair trade imo. 
---
Did you guys find a way to get in? I'm stuck with this same bug too.
---
The abandoned shack near the start that has a doghouse with a chemistry set and periodic table inside of it.   Mister Peabody!
---
I 100% did this. I ground straight to level 40 and then started quests to level up to 50. Grinding is a lot easier without quests unlike previous fallouts, so it kinda made sense. 
---
Any subreddit that allows you to change your flair. Not all do, but this one does
---
Sounds plausible but who knows anymore. We likely won't ever get any kind of confirmation on what is causing the servers to suck ass. I'm the point that I don't believe anything I read here unless there is some kind of evidence or it comes from a credible source. 
---
Eh. I got into him looking for a replacement for TotalBiscuit (RIP). There's some consumer advocate stuff he does that seems ok but then you sometimes get BS shit like this that's very biased and one sided.
---
It might just be Bethesda blinkers he has on but it really calls to question ALL of his content. 
---
Certainly makes me question whether or not to keep watching his videos, and this is coming from someone who can acknowledge ALL of that crap that this game and Bethesda has brought onto themselves and can still enjoy the good aspects of the game without fanboying over it.
---
I'll get the body paint, you bring the roofies.
---
Reputation matters.  I wouldn’t use some random new dll.
---
I put extra stuff in the Overseer’s stash box at the church in Flatwood
---
I've got something to do later. Didn't realize the SMG was levelled.
---
Honestly, if you think about YouTubers needing stuff to make videos about, it's easier for them to make a video called "Bethesda Fallout 76 Disaster" and overexaggerate every problem people are supposedly having than to make a video and say the game is just okay and could be better.
---
I've been playing the game since it came out with only a few problems (about the same as Battlefield 4 in 2018, for example), and then I heard my coworker say he heard "the beta was a disaster." Really? I logged on during the beta, ran around, killed stuff, and collected junk and weapons. So it varies.
---
I'm talking about the glitch. Not even servers. Could be in item to cause the server to crash. Who says its another dupe?
---
Things that hold value at under max item level are mostly legendary explosive, 2 shot, or bloody melee. Makes for good leveling tools.
---
I might have to go to desk top Version cause Mobile will not let me.
---
You can also make the garb at an armor workbench. ;)
---
Nothing yet ?
---
Did you even read the post? This has nothing to do with liking or disliking the game. You’re part of the problem.
---
The times are listed in game. Go into the ‘edit’ mode and hover over an extractor and it shows the number produced per hour. 
---
Genuinely made me smile. 
---
I was really not expecting that hahahahah
---
Well destroying your structures is a different kind of PvP, I don't think pacifist mode will stop that. But as for killing the person inside it'll protect you. Then you can just repair all and problem solved, really not that big of a deal
---
Wooby needs to be freed 
---
Bethesda doesn’t support mods for FO76.  Your argument is crap.
---
Missing carnivore, which is just the opposite of herbivore
---
Great photo. But that dress makes your butt look fat. ;-)

Inside the vault. Check the launcher 
---
I think we will get an email notification if our ticket is updated (not sure though). You can always check the status of your ticket at: [help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview) 
---
Yeah, I am pretty sure we can't progress with the main quest until we find a way passed the bug :( . I feel the same way, I do not want to restart everything; I've spent so many caps on plans and so much time on designing my CAMP. u/Charles_Manitoba suggested getting a teammate to open the door for you - if you play with others, that might be an option!
---
It's a shame, Bunker Buster got me really excited about the main quest, I was really looking forward to progressing.
---
Sweet rolls I hear make you pretty sweet.
---
You are so clever with your fresh, new joke about the Atom store!
---
Auto stim armor only uses one stim per minute so how did it use so many up? Don't you get to choose your respawn location on PS4? On PC you can respawn anywhere you have discovered already for the fast travel cost to those locations, but your camp and vault 76 are free.
---
Sucks as a first experience but on the positive side it may have taken ages to build but if you have the materials you can just go to the C.A.M.P. and choose to repair all structures. No need to rebuild bit by bit. The explosive minigun is probably duped which is the really dumb part. I have one that I found on a vendor but I'm assuming it's one sold to the vendor by a duper and don't rely on it.
---
I should have report him, it was just one of those types of thing where afterwards you think of a hundred ways you could have handled it and get mad at yourself in the shower about lol. I'm over it now, but next time I wont respond. I'll just report, block, and move on.
---
I dint think people are concerned about it working or not, but rather what it opens them up to by using it.
---
I don't think there are enough downvotes in the world for this trash
---
How do you pay to win in RDR Online? I haven't played for a few weeks but last time I played the best PvP gun was Varmint rifle that cost $70 of in game currency, not real money. The premium currency buys clothing items, horses, etc.
---
I miss the vertibird signal grenades from FO4. If we could have those (without the chance of being shot down by greifers) that would be a lot of fun. 
---
We don't even need side mounted miniguns either.
---
My Small Purifier is working fine. 
---
The loot was shit if you were level 15+ but still this is a negative change to make. 
---
Do u want some help? on ps4
---
You are stuck in a loop lol. Just because you CAN do something doesnt make it right. Saying "well it's not my fault if other players didnt think to mule, it's not cheating if everyone can do it" is just plain ridiculous. If you cant see that then this conversation is over because if we cant agree on that we cant agree in this argument. Good luck to you friend, and I hope you continue being able to rationalize cheating to yourself. Cheers!
---
I got the scorched earth achievement 
---
The last few arnt actually available on spotify. In order to listen to them you have the mp3 on your computor. There are other versions of the same songs but its not the same.
---
There is a mod on the nexus called "More where that came from" that adds a radio station I think.
---
Its a person who duplicates items in the game by exploit
---
I felt the same way! And it's too bad we can't start our own little gang since we've been promoted to Mistress and all.
---
ok, let me hop on.  Give me 5 min
---
It's fun to play solo too.
---
Wow, mind blown. Thanks!
---
No place does it say they were using pacifist mode.
---
Bethesda needs to fix bugs for about 3 more months, then do a hard reset on the servers. They could even just start a "Season 2" server set and let everyone either continue playing on Season 1 servers with their current characters (filled with duped items and people who power leveled via bugged content), or start fresh on Season 2 with everyone starting equally in a scenario where nothing is duped and the game is not bugged.
---
Someone who takes advantage of the game mechanics/glitches to exploit them and duplicate items.
---
Also consider making low level ones and scrapping them for said plans.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019

In their inside the vault they said something about player vending. 
---
&gt;Whatcha doin' in my waters
---
 I like you. What do you think of me?  
---
Make an assessment.  
---
You like Bailey's? Mmmm... creamy. Soft, creamy beige.   
---
If the condition is beyond 100% it will deal more damage. As of 100 and below it will have it's normal damage. Probably that's not it as you say it happened to all your weapons.
---
Thanks for letting us know. Please keep us updated.
---
Shooting them down would be fun
---
duper = duplication, they are people that use bugs and glitches to duplicate some of the top items that are hard to come by via ordinary means.
---
again.. to bethesda.. mob button... you wanna get rid of the bullies .. we need to become a mob... but when we do they dont just lose their junk.. they lose everything on them.. weapons included... tired of getting our butts kicked by lvl140s who can (in passive mode) still kills us with the explosive rounds..and 1 NOT get a wanted lvl OR 2 They are so big the wanted lvl doesnt matter to them... at wanted lvl 100+ we should have the option to create a mob...to take the out ... but when we do they lose everything.. including their weapons... duped or not..
---
There’s one that spawns in a bus on the road near the lumber mill just down hill from Vault 76. 
---
I would just really love a yay/nay from Bethesda regarding using Reshade at all.  Have always used it in FO4 and Skyrim, love how it makes everything sharp and pop, but not worth getting banned over by any means.  I'm currently waiting on a response to a support ticket to see if I can get a clear answer.
---
One thing I really liked about this quest is that Kent Connelly got a terminal entry, making comments about continuity in the comics. Kent is awesome. 
---
Make it so pacifist mode actually prevents damage
---
Considering most players have them I think I am average
---
!remindme 1 minute 
---
Nah, I get it. I just mean if you ever come across that sort of thing again in future.
---
Or I think other people were just saying block and move on. That too.
---
Whatever you're happy with at the end of the day but yeah, this shit also needs to be fixed.
---
That would be interesting 
---

---
So refreshing, thanks for the insight.
---
My vague post is terrible. I should've put more thought into the statement. 
---
I'm a solo player. I'd like to know what others 100+ do to stay in tune with the game. 
---
And also to see if anyone needs a friend who will hell
---
Yeah, but I'm sure people would figure out a way to abuse the living crap out of it.
---
Like setting up a camp with a tall tower of missile turrets and agroing the vertibot enough that the turrets engage and blow the poor player riding past out of the sky for no reason.
---
I really don't like the explosive damage nurf that is the fireproof perk.  So because the TSE is broken as hell, my explosive build(non TSE) is trash now in PVP.  And no i will not be getting 100% explosive immune because then there is no skill to the using explosive weps.
---
I really wish they had just taken the explosive perk off the TSE guns.  Yes it would make the game harder, its the damn apocalypse not a walk in the park.    
---
These guys did one thing, Bethesda did everything go else.  Get a little perspective instead of being a dick to the people who made the entire game.
---
&gt; A TSE on the other hand requires zero skill
---
So walking up to someone who has a bounty while they're unable to hit you, then using vats for the 100% chance to hit, takes more skill than aiming manually if you want a guaranteed hit?
---
No, I always get 15 out of my three. do you have enough power? Try storing and replacing.
---
Had to go to desktop site to fix it thank you!
---
My armor says once every 20 seconds. And yes I can choose my respawn location, but after originally losing all my stimpacks I still have to go through that area for my quest, which then leads to the frames dropping and freezing all over again lol.
---
I eventually was able to finish what I needed, but the game was constantly freezing.
---
At least they're not disconnected and bored as hell. 
---
I do think that "professional" youtubers are kind of in a bad place in that they are slaves to views and as such their content often suffers. They have to stretch their videos out and keep posting regularly even if they don't have anything worth saying. It seems as though this guy has "gone to the darkside" in that scenario and it seems to be working for him, I guess. 
---
Do you need a reason to be a raider? :p
---
PSA: Hide in the elevator. Turns that hellish last part into a 5 minute wait-a-thon. 
---
Tbh I use sniping in conjuction with a stealh loadout. Works wonders even at high levels depending on what youbare doing.
---
My friend who likes to go in guns a blazing style wonders why I always have a shite ton of stims, ammo, and nowhere near as much need to repair my stuff.
---
I get what you mean. I mean I get it from a programming perspective too but if getting that rate requires you to sit in front of the machine pulling out items as you go, maybe there's a more useful metric that can be given instead.
---
The dude sure knows his audience and milks it well.
---
Also, if this post reaches hundreds of upvotes, be prepepared for a: "r/fo76 is a hategroup against youtubers,15 minute, three ads" video from him.
---
The end game is kill 3 star legendaries and hope for the very small chance you will get some very small percent chance of some combination of legendary effects on the exact item type you want. Which for me is Heavy Combat Armor. I look at things in a probability kind of way, and the hours I might have to spend trying to get lucky RNG. It doesn't hold my interest.
---
Lots of corporations are connected in the fallout universe. Robco, general atomics, nuka cola, vault-tec, even the guys who make giddyup buttercup. Interesting find tho! 
---
I’m with punda, I’ve done a little testing and past 4 of the top purifiers I swear I don’t see gain it’s just spread throughout them more so I don’t go over 3-4 anymore.
---
Coming soon to a wasteland near you...THE VINDOCATORS !!!
---
pvp is love
---
I definitely have crashed while looking through my stash, but I don't think I have this problem. 
---
I would try emptying your inventory as much as possible and then try to take the weapon out of stash. Try to avoid getting overemcumbered.
---
I haven't done that "pre-req" quest - but I did have the issue where I couldn't trigger Patrol Duty, for weeks. Eventually, I think I managed to fix it by participating when someone else triggered it, and ever since that time, I can trigger it fairly regularly now.
---
So many of us want this I'm sure! Was just speaking with someone about it a couple days ago; we were so surprised it hasn't happened yet!
---
Pretty sure Bethesda stated any game file altering can result in ban.
---
Even Empath? That's the one that I always hated since I don't party often.
---
Okay, I gotta do some stuff real quick, add me. Gamertag is SpicyPapaCake.
---
Oh, go home. Trying that partial quote nonsense then doubling back on it entirely. As if quoting you whole makes a difference in what you said and my point. Think.
---
You know what griefing is, you're just being a dick. Plain and simple. "Oh, oh, but it's a FEATURE!" Still doesn't mean you're not a dick.
---
Like some level 144 shows up on my doorstep and I'm going to have a chance fighting back. Simply because he "wants too" and it's "in the game" or "the wasteland is hard and tough" that makes it okay?
---
So I'm not allowed to enjoy the world and story of 76 simply because another guy wants to be a dick? I'm not allowed to experience that because another guy wants to be a dick?
---
You want to feel ALIVE by fighting someone that doesn't consent? Ya fuckin' rapist. Someone minding their own business then you want to use them for your own personal enjoyment? Yeah, that's totally not being a dick. "IT'S PART OF THE GAME!"
---
You're a low level human with minimal intellect. You think the internet gives you a voice and everyone is equal, huh? I'm done with you. Anything else you say will not be seen, read, heard, or acknowledged. Enjoy that.
---
then listen slowly and closely since you fail to comprehend stuff
---
you come here spewing your toxic shit all over the place, you dont know shit about the game,you fail to give any answers to direct questions, you are a rude and spoiled child, and then you wonder at the response you get?
---
is that a language you understand? or should it be drawn with crayons for you?
---
so, yeah, toiletdrinker is fitting
---
Yep. I've gotten up to 560 carry weight
---
Eventually, but you won't learn the initial Marine Arms, that one you'll need the plan for.
---
Oh yes! Lots of debate about which famously smart doggo this easter egg is referencing! Though Einstein's equation written on the floor is likely to point to the character Dr. Emmett Brown's dog Einstein from back to the future! 
---
You get furniture?!
---
Half your luck, I only ever see food recipes...
---
I’ve just launched my first nuke an hour ago, level 48. Power armour is compulsory at this level I’d say plus a few guns and at least a sturdy melee weapon.  Im a heavy build but id recommend taking a gun you can aim down sights with for turrets, decent amount of stimpacks with lockpick level 3 and hacker level 3. 
---
Hack terminals and turn the turrets against the robots by selecting “remove targeting parameters”, then disable the turrets once the gunfire stops. 
---
At the repair mainframe section you can also craft/repair broken mainframe cores at a tinkerers workbench, I’m sure there’s one in the adjacent room. I only found that out after I’d launched the nuke and fast travelled to use the tinkerers workbench at Watoga Station
---
Are you saying you wouldn't seductively pose right next to a couple of slightly decomposed bodies?
---
They don't even need to pick it up unless it takes forever for you to log in or out. Be sure to bring up social tab at the login screen to join directly back to your buddy. Try to be sure you log out and in at the same spot.
---
Yea that's pretty much the boat I'm in right now. 
---
Never try to reason with stupid or crazy. Ignore it if you can, kill it if you have to, rinse/repeat as required.
---
I don't think they went into nearly enough about how insane modus became.
---
Someone that hopefully gets banned
---
Yeah, more sad that my stealth boy was eaten more than the c-shocks :(
---
game is great. duppers do not affect my game at all. dont agree with dipping. but it doesnt affect my game at all. fallout 76 is alot of fun.
---
Integrity is one of those thing that's hard to come by, either on Youtube or in-game for that matter.
---
The situation with dupers/exploiters justifying their actions and Youtubers seemingly lowering their standards to either draw out video length to play the algorithm or create sensational content for views are mirrored in a lot of ways.
---
It's all a shame really.
---
Noooooooooo I don’t have 500 I have zero He doesn’t get anything that’s the point
---
Well if you read my post that's not the point I'm making, but okay. If you want an echo chamber for your thoughts then Tumblr might be more appropriate.
---
I spawned a legendary from a supermutant.
---
I think there's still plenty of runway to find out. I imagine there's going to be at least some added content for the rest of the bunker. 
---
 Unfortunately it is not.  .38 is the only ammo change receiver.
---
Just had the same experience, it's still going on as i am typing this. The scorchbeast queen flies to the east edge of the map, you cant go there. Lame. I did notice it was not fissure site prime getting nuked but the one to the west of it, would that cause the bug? I also noticed very little damage being done by the players and the queen got from about 50% hp back to full hp once as well. 
---
some in-game cabins are prebuilt objects, but there are others that are clearly built with the cabin build set already
---
I understand how this can ruin the game a bit for other honest players.
---
I read a post about a player being killed by 'dupe-hunters', but he wasn't actually a duper, so he just got all his stuff destroyed for nothing.
---
How do those people decide who to hunt? How can you tell someone is a duper? 
---
Because they are loyal fanboys. Its human nature. Just look at how the elderly in Russia defend Stalin's Policies until their death... Some people just like to eat shit. 
---
Tons of games do it....
---
It sounds nice. Is it more northeast or northwest
---
I just googled it WTF did i just watch???? lol.
---
Your point is that it's not cheating because it doesnt have a large effect on gameplay, my point is that it is cheating regardless of the implications. We wont agree, and that's okay. Let's just go our separate ways.
---
Kill another cargo bot. I've started killing two before I go in, just in case.
---
Alright my gt is DeathclawAlpha8 measage me when,ur ready 
---
I was depressing, but the lore(holo tapes and terminal entries) in Huntersville was the one that has affected me the most so far.
---
Almost literally north
---
Dupers do it in pairs, so if someone is hunting them they go for people that are close together on the map.
---
Duping also causes server wide lag, which affects everyone on that server, and can even cause it to crash.
---
Nvm i found it
---
See above 
---
Yongyea is trash and does nothing but feed into circlejerks
---
Can you link me the source?  Not being a jerk just want to read the exact language of what they wrote.  I, like many others, use QoL mods that have nothing to do with cheating, duping, OsK, and am not really worried that this is going to go afoul of Bethesda.  What I want to know is what they specifically think about the use of Reshade.  
---
The problem is as I research this on reddit and the internet in general I'm running into a lot of conjecture or hearsay but no definite links/sources to back it up (yet).
---
Copper and junk are the same color for my colorblind ass
---
Wrong post man.
---
This is the only way i go into nukes now. Its so helpful. 
---
Eh not really, I’m non-auto rifle sniper build, I keep another gun or two on me for different scenarios like mid and close range.  Lever action, combat rifle, assault rifle, handmade can all serve these purposes modded right.  I have one legendary of each I switch between as desired.  Depending on if I’m just out and about or doing queen or whitesprings changes which I prefer to bring, some of which is cause of legendary effects.
---
That sounds like a great idea.  Bottom line: I simply don't want to share a world flooded with  duped god-like weapons. 
---
&gt; 1 at the municipal building behind a level 3 lock pick door.
---
Don't you mean the one inside the Watoga Transit Hub? And you missed the fifth one: on the roof of the high school, and the sixth one: on the roof of the EMS building. ;-)
---
No, I don’t dupe or buy dupes 
---
If it is ok with you could you check for maybe one other spot
---
How do people build so much? After putting in 5 turrets, a few walls and roof, a bed and work stations I run out of allowed stuff.
---
Fuck this game and fuck todd howard. polish your game you ignorant slut.
---
It's a bug, kick them from the team entirely, or 're equip strange in numbers.
---
I've kinda had this. Same situation but instead of losing the mutation it suppressed it until i unequipped the perk.

---
Yea I restarted the game and my marsupial came back but not my speed demon
---
They are op, but the enemies are bullet sponges with normal weapons and melee can one shot kill thay are also op
---
My least favorite part is there is no clear path to getting the exact items you want. And also the PvP system. Many games have had PvP flagging, and chaotic or outlaw characters, etc. and the systems are well done. This system isn't satisfying for anyone. People who want nothing to do with PvP get tricked into being killed. People who want to PvP are stuck at a disadvantage because of slap damage and one shot response, or being killed by people from a slap damage "invulnerable" position. Etc. Gearing up for PvP and then PvPing would be my ideal endgame, but both of these are dysfunctional.
---
Yeah it does damn good damage and I'm still able to fight things around fifteen levels higher than me thanks to it
---
Are you on PC? If so that’s some interesting news. Now sure if I like it... the point of supply drops should be for everyone to get supplies. I was planning on using a lot of mine to help out low levels in the area :/
---
The decoy house has no generators. it is feed from my power station in the bunker, so I rarely get anything attacking the house. they may be walking around but they ignore the decoy 95% of the time.
---
The bunker has very low head space. just enough for me to walk around in PA., so Super mutant IMO cant spawn in. It is also completely floored which I think helps keep mole rates out.
---
just a guess but so far never any spawn inside the bunker.
---
That isn't slap damage. That's someone stacking bobbleheads to get around slap damage. They should not stack or slap damage should be a constant value not able to be manipulated. Poor design. 
---
Agree completely.
---
Whenever I fast travel to my camp, I spawn right on the edge of the cliff (I have  to be careful to not walk forward, lest I fall), and whenever I  travel to a friends camp, I  spawn in the foundations of his building
---
That second server would need a separate reddit economic market place
---
Ow you're right. Sorry my bad haha. That was meant for another tab...
---
"Your point is that it's not cheating because it doesnt have a large effect on gameplay..."
---
That's one part of it but not it entirely. Game design is not simple, compromises have to be made. You can't just assume something is cheating because you don't agree with it.
---
Same requirements?
---
I have medium generators but that space was too low for them, so i just stacked smalls.
---
K I’ll try that I got one of them back after restarting my game tho 
---
Let's just say that I had a different take on the matter.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/AtpL6Bk.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AtpL6Bk.jpg)
---
Makes me wish that there was a sullen, mourning, head lowered kind of pose for moments like this.
---
Probably because its taking up stock room, which could be used for more profitable items.
---
Well that would make sense, it being a moth and all that... I genuinely hope that's a thing!
---
I know. I just need to learn the butressed modification. Just scrapping loads now and getting closer.
---
It would be profitable if not for all the TSE guns being used in that event, I tried a number of times to play that one and rarely got a shot in on the miners due to the team present taking them out in one shot.
---
You don't think 16,000 lbs worth of junk is a lot? You're being silly.
---
On the upside, save on build budget for water purifiers :)
---
Since  i have yet to aquire one, it drives me to play every day. At the moment its all i try to find and  I'm lvl 68
---
Again, not talking about pacifist mode. Talking about its presence in a world that allows PvP freely. It's as if they weren't sure what kind of interaction they actually wanted between players. 
---
On my main character level 237 (with 8 luck) &amp; secondary level 63 (with 15 luck), I have never once seen a TSE gun drop for either character yet, while a level 30 friend at the time got a TSE drop.  I'm sorry but that's really out of whack RNG to the point I don't want to play anymore IF they cannot fix the GAP across the player base in '19.  
---
If TSE guns are going to still drop in your idea they really need to UP the chance of those weapons dropping so any player can get at least one typical (ballistic/energy) gun in TSE form by level 100 or so.
---
I really prefer that they completely removing explosive, or making TSE just TS or E as in 1 or the other, as well as nerfing melee to do max damage that the strongest legendary ballistic/energy weapon can do in the game for balancing (my focus is melee so that would really effect me but I'm fine with it for balancing absolutely). 
---
I think you got good ideas, but the big one for me is the TSE being split up to TS or E should be like numero uno (with afforementioned melee debuff to properly balance of course). 
---
What a strange choice on Bethesdas part. Couldn't this be a very trolly thing to do?.
---
So... they're trying to get rid of their copies, or...?
---
The seasons in diablo are for completely different reasons then this. They are for new content in the game and to keep everyone even. 
---
Mirelurk queen is a wrong info. Queens never spawn alone and are aways in set spawn points.
---
Yup and quickly
---
Ah ok
---
Which is why i always nuke fissure site  prime with the very edge of the blast zone. Can use dropsite 9 as a fast travel point and fight her in normal armour. I wish more people did this.
---
This is a great idea but imagine the duper’s putting whatever they don’t want in a chest for anyone in the server to take. They would have to go after all the duping bugs to do this 
---
I'm a simple man. I see a good photo, I upvote.
---
Dr_-_emu if you want to ever join me when in on. I'm not quite level 30 yet though. 
---
Yup
---
the game engine is like a ship full of holes, and it won't take much longer to sink with all the duping and other exploits, this has to be the most incompetent online game I've played in a good long while.
---
I'm not even mad at this point, it is pretty fun to see what interesting new way people find to break the game.
---
The only tamable deathclaw is always level 21. The level 61 is the travel merchant encounter,or the nest encounter,both untamable.
---
Fusion is great.  Lots of power, quiet and not to tall.  Just got it on my 2nd power plant run.  I just got to 50. Taking it slow.
---
Thanks again! I am going to light shit up with this tomorrow
---
To bad those items are gone when the server crashes/ends still someone find it before then so good on ya, what system you on? Maybe I’ll find something I don’t have 
---
Call me agressive, but I'd prefer it if they:
---
Nerf explosive weapons to the point where I would prefer an instigating minigun.
---
Then wipe out all.bobbleheads and magazines from every inventory (stashbox, or player inventory).
---
Kills all the TSE BS and gets rid of the bobblehead problem. Bobbleheads can always be found again.
---
So they could even be the reason I get kicked off the server WAY too often? Well now I'm mad.. 
---
I find discs are always cheaper. They're less convenient and could eventually degrade. You can resell it, but for less than you paid (which is why discs are cheaper).
---
I'd be cool if they raised SPECIALS another 10 pts and hard cap it there
---
&gt;REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Damn, champ
---
I'm pretty sure "Call for Help" is meant for when another player is nearby who might revive you. If there's no one around, it won't pop up. 
---
Report it and move on. Post after post has been made by people saying there's new server shut down methods to dupe. Yes it's a cancer, no this isn't a case of exposure so Bethesda sees it. THEY KNOW. PLEASE report it. 
---
The malicious dupers will be finding it no matter what. What we want to stop are the casual dupers. Someone who picked up a piece of armor and wants to make a few more for friends. We don't need that. Those will be the vast majority of the people doing it. 
---
This game is a extreme disapointment, I was on the good game train for a couple days but this is crap. Im sorry this game, in this year, with RDR2 God of War 4 and Spiderman being out, and this game being shit, there is no way. 
---
That's ridiculous. So Saviour is pointless?
---
It must be a nightmare everytime you miss those 3 point shots.
---
Turrets. They take up an astronomical amount of budgets, plus at high lvl they do tickle damage to mobs. I’m lvl 103 and don’t even bother with them.
---
Has someone tested this though? 
---
Theres that YT video where someone tested assasins+sentinel and they found that in most cases they could only survive 2 shots from a TSE, and that some guns still just seemed to 1-shot regardless.
---
Kinda took the wind out of sentinel+assasins a bit.
---
I wonder if life is old there...
---
Thanks 
---
Yes, the recent patch (comes to consoles tomorrow) is meant to stop the duping, hopefully these people wont find any other method to do this again
---
One of the shops in Whitesprings uses log cabin skin for the walls. Looks nice with the flooring in there, which is also different than what we have available. 
---
Soooo let me start with my level.. 308...  
---
I've not done anything but the Enclave and Raider Rose quest lines (I've not been to the first overseers camp.. Seriously!).   
---
 B
---
The grinding for perfect Legendaries and plans is part of the end game, but in my mind it's a tiny part of it..  
---
The end game is literally community building.  
---
Slowly, by example (and by happenstance running into a few like minded folks) We've got a growing group of people who do grind WhiteSprings, but we also running around dropping 1* - 3*'s on vendors, in cash registers, bag for people to find..  
---
When we trade with someone and it turns out they are a newer player we deck them out in gear they need, and we keep and eye out for the wish list items for each other..  
---
We build rocking settlements, jump in and help people when they need it, and invite randoms into our WhiteSprings runs..  
---
Ohhh
---
And exploring...   
---
Seriously I spent the first month always overweight, and frequently still am, and I walk around allot, it's really fun to run into unmarked spots on the map, see old places from a new angle and generally enjoy the experience..  
---
All this said, I'll admit I'm an outlier.  
---
Yeah, that's not it, but that's good to know. I was unaware of that
---
Finish any missed quests, then keep an eye out for new content. 
---
Shit I'll make you as much as you want, but I won't be on until later tonight. I'll even give it to you if you have some plans I don't have yet.
---
My favorite part of the vid. Guns cool. Just watching that tidy little bar... It looks so... Usable.
---
Travel merchant? It was a hostile albino deathclaw all by itself, encounter at the fallen vertibird. Are you saying it's possible to tame with only 4 charisma? If so I'd need to try a few more times.
---
I didnt know there was a fireplace. That would go perfectly right beside my grand piano lol
---
True and honestly who needs more than 2-4 purifiers.  I have 4 and have more purified water than I need, albeit I’m a vegetarian and make carrot, corn, mutfruit and the wheat stuff into soups and mutfruit drink so I rarely need a purified water for my actual thirst meter just some chem stuff now and then.  I used to sell it but there’s plenty of other ways to get crap to sell like nuke zone unused flux, ionized meat / drink, all my meat stuff I pickup and some take the time for cook I sell, sometimes I do a little healing salve run to sell those, bulk extra junk, and just random weapons/armor if I don’t need the steel for ammo at the moment
---
You think you need to see above to be shown Kung Fu? In this place?
---
Definitely mods
---
Since the first day of Fallout 76 until now i must have launched about 2 dozen nukes. I know exactly what you're feeling since this has happened to me at least half of all these times.
---
Actually, that can't bw true because a friend was standing right next to me.
---
I don't know about Xbox but on PS4 the physical disc didn't stop it from downloading the whole game, and then a patch the same size or slightly bigger. So don't expect to save yourself a download if you buy a physical disc.
---
I’ve read that “stuff” stays in containers for about an hour (drop bags last 10-15 minutes) and that people put things in the Vendors cash registers. So thought why not!? 
---
Yup. Picked one last night and had no idea. Played like 2 hours before someone put me out of my misery at the palace of the winding path. And he didn't steal my junk so thanks for that whoever you were.  
---
I do the same thing, almost always at Watoga station in the blue one against the bench, I leave all the ammo, aid and plans that I don't need there. Just dropping them into a paper bag is the same as just deleting them so I'd rather some random player to find them and be surprised to find ultracite plans and chems, I only use rad away, stims, magazines and bobbleheads.
---
It's very hard to describe, but there's a little area between two buildings northwest of the train station where power armor mods spawn on top of a crate. 
---
Yeah, i got to like 80ish killed the scorthbeast queen, got the xo1, and fusion generator and feel cashed out. All there was left was challenges and farming legendaries. It felt stale and I don't think dlc could make me come back.
---
Hilariously, my friends told me about this a few days ago: they had a random firefight with high levels simply because another group over-heard them complaining about duping, and then they started shooting because they thought my friends were duping. 
---
Honestly, everyone involved needs to stop this duper hunt. We shouldn't be hunting down each other without any evidence of duping. That's just going to negatively affect the player base and effectively kill the game, especially if journalists catch the news on this.
---
I find that others spawn at a different location than the owner. Usually they spawn near where the C.A.M.P was originally placed. 
---
It shows the rad damage as being like 10% of the total damage.
---
That's a horrible idea. Arguably worse than just a server wipe, because that means everybody who already put a lot of time and effort into the game is stuck with the filthy cheaters. If everybody was wiped clean, at least those people would have no choice but to accept their loss, but nobody's actually going to do that if they can choose to keep their hundreds of hours of progress.
---
the real question is why are you jumping out of the PA to melee a mutant when you could just stay in it lol
---
Turrets take a lot of your allotment.
---
Yeah which sucks because mine is in the foundation of the house lol
---
Finely founded fragments of fabulously fortuitous foundational facts fastidiously frosty, frolicking funnily from farther famously forlorn forts, festering fatheaded fatmen's fixations further floundering far from famed festivals freely finding fine favorites from fifty-four feverish fleshly fishing freemen, found fervently fasting, flailing, flippantly fanning fantastically fumigated fiery french fries, fired from felled faux firs.
---
Ok so I guess I'm an idiot. What's a duper?
---
It’s not even launching the nuke that’s the resource suck. It’s the fight that comes after. Either tons of radx, rad away, and stimpacks fighting ghouls and death claws or hundreds to thousands of rounds of annoying fighting the sbq. Launching a nuke is relatively easy compared to what follows.
---
Ima be honest IGN's 5/10 is what it deserves
---
I have almost 200 hours in this game and I've never seen the Mothman. Maybe he thinks I'm ugly. :(
---
That little gem is a skit from The Mighty Boosh. And you're welcome. Lol.
---
They posted the source code with it, there's nothing malicious in it.
---
Not true, it absolutely caused server instability. I’ve seen it happen. 
---
The loading screens are so annoying.
---
It's a risk, I used it for a month but stopped to be on the safe side
---
There is no evidence of anyone being banned for using it however. 
---
What main story is that? Must have missed that! xD
---
Haha amazing. Finally a reason to use .45 ammo lol
---
That's intense, see this is what I was hoping for from my post thank you, 
---
How much are you paying?
---
Brilliant share. Thanks very much! 
---
Lmao what a generous offer
---
That would be awesome 
---
I like the unique loot part, but the bounty and the potential to be sniped coming out of the lockpick screen are a bad idea. 
---
But unique, non-instanced loot is a good way to promote PVP. Maybe make a small radius around the drop a PVP zone stripped of the slap system. They have these kind of drops in ARK and claiming them is always a fun risk/reward situation. 
---
Level 237 and a side level 63 character here and both I've done heavy farming for TSE weapons and got all my levels from that basically and I still have not seen a single TSE weapon drop.  0 TSE drops...
---
I have seen a single shot explosive cryolator drop exactly twice (talk about a useless weapon, much less get it twice), but never a TSE gun.  
---
If I didn't already have the ones I bought from players for cheap (100% dupes basically) I'd of given up on this game by now by how unfair advantage those TSE players would of had at PVP against me and PvE for that matter with tap stealing to not get XP or inventory drops.
---
Bethesda really needs to fix the drop rates of TSE's to guarantee everybody gets them by like level 90 on a worst case RNG roll or make them craftable at really high levels (200/250+) to give another path to attain them on a gaurantee basis to save player experiences in this aspect.
---
You don't craft diluted stimpacks and radaway. That's where 99% of my water goes. 
---
I agree. They're much less viable in VATS builds - I have tried using more Hip Fire accuracy mods, and it helps some - but I think there's a major issue that needs fixing. In the meantime, I'm just not using mine.
---
Decent!
---
Most players do not have TSEs.
---
Don't underestimate the power of proper lighting. Many tend to whitewash their camp when just a candle can provide sufficient light. 
---
Vault Tech statue in the corner with a small lamp behind it that can't be seen, but provides backlighting that actually lights up the room just enough. Backlit posters on three opposite walls to add a little charm. 
---
But that's the thing...for some of these machines that are supposed to, by their descriptions, produce a bottle a minute, I'm lucky if they produce one an HOUR. 
---
&gt;  I wish you could upgrade all special weapons like the voice of set and blade of basset.
---
I wish I hadn't scrapped the Voice of Set thinking I could craft it back at any time. :-/
---
Killing the Queen a few Times per session. Helping other players with random stuff. I suck at building but enjoy finding new places to build a new camp in. Chasing the elusive calibrated shocks for x-01 (even posting for trades which i do not enjoy due to dupers messed up the market).
---
I have more or less the items i need as heavy/melee to wreck the Queen but sure I am always looking for interesting gear. 
---
I played VATS rifle build to lvl 160 and then respecced to heavy gunner with melee swap function so that took around 40 levels to fix. Now the extra levels just stack up so i might respecc again if I get a feel for it. Love the current build though. Different versions of 50 cal MG and Gatling Gun is fun to swap between plus some other for the lols like fatman, tesla etc..
---
Love the game but do not think I would play as much as I still do if it was not for the fun I have just talking in Discord with my team. Playing with people ive met in game via random Voice chat encounter,
---
Lvl 240 ish on PC. Will push on but would need more variation. More tough end game encounters than the buggy Queen and preferbly more to explore sooner than later to keep me interested.
---
I have a 30ish power surplus. 
---
Well there's dead, and there's dead dead. You can only be revived if you're mostly dead, but sometimes they hit you so hard you are dead dead.
---
Ah, just when you were coming out of your shell you go back to lazy copy + paste.
---
You really need help.
---
I mean you’ve claimed to not care multiple times yet you keep responding but at the same, put such little effort into it.
---
Do you think lazy responses will let you “win” at this point? Because if they haven’t already you’re deluding yourself to think they will.
---
Yeah i don't even want to know how bad it is on consoles 
---
(one of the) wiki(s) says it's 10-15-25% recoil reduction.
---
Some, but I have pharma farma and find so many I rarely need to
---
They don't have to fix it, it will fix itself once they release more stars
---
Get a dense armor mod and throw on Fireproof. Now they're just shooting at you with a normal two shot, and likely not hitting you in good spots as they're used to explosions doing the work.
---
Mop it uuuupppp
---
Just another reason this game is trash ._.
---
I thought that may have been the problem too but even taking something as small as 5 carry weight when I have over a hundred available... It still crashes.
---
Yeah. But that's still stupid. My point is don't always show me stuff that isn't there. There's a different yellow vault tec stash box that's been in one of them for a while. Still hasn't been released as far as I can tell.
---
Yeah or you can drop down where the floor opens and also wait it out.  My buddy pointed that out after I wasted a bunch of time and ammo killing everything.  I figured you had to actually defend the terminal.  Apparently not. 
---
just being able to play however I want. the community is shit and sometimes counterproductive to the game.
---
It stays are medium, they are saved in your documents folder as .png files
---
Where is that at?
---
Have you seen duping. Anyone can buy one now 
---
Dude Watoga has tons of candy...and there’s plenty of thread now you just need a box and a stick
---
yea but you sit at like 5/10% health max, making you basically a meat punching bag, especially if your enemy has a ranged weapon, it's lights out.  High damage for sure, but super easy to be killed in that state before you can even have a hope to hit with that damage. 
---
How about the perk card that doubles what u craft. I craft  stimpaks diluted and always have around 200 of them.
---
This. Only Welch I use the desk. 
---
My preferred register for you PS4 folks is the right register at Phoenix in Watoga. Btw, thanks to whoever put plans in there for security doors. 
---
Honestly. The Fireproof buff was an improvement on explosive PvP advantage. At this point buffing other literal useless affixes, as well as adding new ones as content comes out, is probably the best fix.
---
If you're not talking about pacifist mode, why are you talking about it?
---
Yeah
---
*Screams in Front Royal*  THAT'S  IN REGULAR VIRGINIA
---
Hmm, well I might just be imagining it too, like I said I can't remember for sure what it used to be, if anything different at all. I just had a feeling like I remembered it being different than armor piercing. I swear at least one of the mods used to add bleed damage...
---
I've gotten pretty far with a build for the chainsaw, I'm really curious what you've come up with for a build. 
---
Focusing solely on damage I just got my chainsaw to cap out around 100dmg earlier today. Shoot, while writing this I realized I didn't even use drugs.... Dang, I really wonder what the absolute upper limits are still. 
---
I'm almost too scared to even use the thing anymore, it feels so bad when it starts breaking :P I usually pick one up every time I log in just to repair it and scrap or sell the one from the day before. At least it's fairly easy to manage.
---
Good point
---
i get that sometimes i usually just force my way through it 
---
Well I hope it works. Thanks for your responses, much appreciated.
---
Just let us lock items like you can in ESO. Can't destroy, sell, deconstruct, not trade and it prompts you if you try to modify it. 
---
A level 50 Perfect Storm is a Scorchbeast killing machine 👌 
---
[Video](https://youtu.be/M7eoMpEpYYY) 
---
If we make legendary effects more powerful than we need to buff the mob health. We could also make two shot/explosive effects mutually exclusive, balancing the game without adjusting mob health.
---
Have had my camp leveled so many times and im only level 15 and play alone. Its frustrating at times.
---
Happy to help...
---
The game is what you make of it, more than many I've played in the past, there are tons of little details to discover, locations to find, and in my time in game I've likely only explore 1/20th of the map
---
No change. 
---
Its technically a wood stove but I consider it my fireplace haha. 
---
The only thing this suggestion is missing is the use of the extractor power armor to get additional resources from the node.
---
*accept
---
they already fixed TSEs. Fireproof made assassin's builds virtually invincible.
---
congrats. this community bitched and moaned until papa Todd listened, and now an even more predatory build is running amok. but of course you wouldn't know, most people here know very little about the game.
---
brilliant. simply brilliant.
---
Well for me it's at a point where I can't progress. And after hours of trying, then having to join a different server, wait for my C.A.M.P. to load, then go to my stash each time, I'm a bit tired of it.
---
20K ammo doesn't have anything to do with this conversation but good for you. You have bandolier and the ammo weighs nothing 👏
---
This is a very late response but I wanted to mention how NPCs are really good for adding atmosphere but can also feel very fake or forced and that if anything fallout 76 should've just had a lot less npcs to add to the atmosphere of being early in the wasteland when people had hardly started rebuilding but I still think it was kinda weird to replace something so well known as the raiders with even more non human npcs that dont even talk and are basically more intelligent ghouls. But I dont want to seem like someone that's jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
Mods for me.  I miss Tesla armor, Vertibird for traveling, the virtually new weapons and armor weekly, and larger settlement allowances.  That said if they put even half of that into the base game I’d be fine without em.  I think most people just want new stuff, and private servers would give that.  Right now the only new stuff we are getting  is the stuff the darn exploiters are giving to everyone.
---
Very well said. How you act in online games like this kinda tell what kind of person you are really. That’s why I always beware to people who find griefing behavior funny. 
---
Any recommended farm spots?
---
Yeah, you get it. This is how the game should be played. I love this story. Show's up in x01 and a minnigun? Yes. I'm in. 
---
About that agility course...
---
Would you say they drop as frequently as with Supers? I guess it doesn't matter because they are all around easier to kill.
---
I don't know 4 but mine is 5 and i tame just fine. I've seen that deathclaw encounter and it's not tamable. Mostrly because it's a fight event, albino deathclaw with its nest vs muties or scorched. Usually it kills them without efforts so it seems it's alone.
---
You can try but there's no proof of it ever being tamed
---
Yeah, it's called Super Duper we both mentioned it in the previous comments. It's a very useful perk.
---
One of the builds I made.  I called him Avg Joe. While everyone else in the vault was the best of the best.  I was the janitor.  He was nothing great before the war, and nothing has changed.  He is about 60 years old and looks like it.  If you see him walking around, he is usually in normal clothing that change daily.  He is just a nice guy that would rather not be bothered by a little thing like the end of the world.  
---
 I have 8s in all my specials, dont use anything high tec, so no PA or advanced armors, no legendary weps.  I dont care to be with all those stuck up vaulters.  I am not out to kill them all but I am also not out to save the world.  So I made a nice cabin in the woods away from others and just roam around seeing the world after the nukes.  I have points in shotty and explosive.  Shotty because i cant aim well enough for normal weps (story). Explosives because I was taught what not to mix as a janitor, and now i am just doing the opposite.  
---
I have that card maxed and always forget to use it, kek.
---
Haha, nice.
---
If you take a massive amount of damage (catastrophic) you are screwed...
---
Yes, couple days ago
---
we also need those vault tech pods / quonset huts / and clean versions of warehouse as its the only one that has holes and broken windows 
---
This is def all types of badass
---
I don't have a great deal to contribute to this.. but yesterday I somehow ended up with a server all to myself. I thought oh I must have a bounty, but there were only 2 players in the recent tab, and folks popped in and out to trade with me.
---
I've got to say it was somewhat more relaxing to not worry about dying, knowing no one would dash for my loot, I could try take a queen down solo, no one around to interrupt enemy spawns, I didn't have to wait for other players to be done with the traders, and there were mods and plans, fusion cores, power armor and loot was just laying around in excess to take... it was a little lonely though and the above things were nice but would get boring fast.
---
Beep beep Richie. 
---
Didn’t see anything about it on here I saw some YouTuber bitching about it and thought it was interesting 
---
Care to explain how it would have been better with computer controlled NPCs telling you things instead of computer controlled tapes from NPCs telling you things? For that matter, the story line wouldn't have even actually worked with NPCs.
---
it makes very little sense here, mostly because from what I understand from the dates in the terminal entries, the order of mysteries was destroyed ten years before everyone else. so these bodies really should be nothing but skeletons.
---
PSA to everyone: If you aren't bothering to read the terminals or listen to the tapes then you are really missing out. It seems like so many people can't be bothered, no wonder they think the game is bad. 
---
One of the best things about fallout are how great the lore and little stories are. So many tales that are told with real heart. It's something fallout has always been fantastic at delivering. 
---
Strange in numbers has been bugged since day 1. All you do is unequip it. 
---
&gt; full unrestricted access to server files so you can run a semi-official server of mod an entirely unofficial server? 
---
Will most likely (wont say 100%) never happen due to MTX. The moment modders have access to create unofficial servers means they can just re release all Atom store items as regular items, giving no one any incentive to buy said items.
---
My realistic view of private servers with modding support are - Servers provided by Bethesda (potentially at a rental cost to cover the cost of resources). Any and all mods will have to go through an approval process ala Creation Club (with the possibility of purchasable mods to cover the cost instead of rental). These mods would most likely not be able to modify any existing server related content, ie. server based scripts. They will be stored on the server and will have to be downloaded by each client that connects to it (so this is where rental/mod cost comes in to cover not only the bandwidth, but the storage costs).
---
no
---
lone wanderer 4 life
---
I've been playing a solo RPG since my friends bailed the first month. Other players are more of a novelty at this point. So why not have the server to myself?
---
If BGS adds real multiplayer content: raids, dungeons, organized PvP or anything that remotely resembles organized activities: I'll pass on private servers.
---
Yup..... I did the same
---
That'll be $4.99
---
Man I just want a working refrigerator for my food, and a cooler for my drinks.  How did they never think of this?
---
Never played it, but I agree with you wholeheartedly.
---
You think this is air you are breathing?
---
In order to avoid the shoot down just give them no combat ability and SBQ level health.  So long as they don’t hit you specifically should be a scenic flight :)
---
Can you give brief instructions on how to acquire this mod?  
---
Not a bad idea at all. I'll have a look at that! I guess item level doesn't effect the quality or likelihood of a plan dropping?
---
Yeah it takes the whole lot at once if you have it all in your inventory
---
what lol
---
It's been on there since I posted, made sure of it
---
Either you have bad weapons/build, or you are getting a horde of noobs running in and making the queen scale up. She's really not hard at all.
---
There have been times when i exited my power armor and it became unowned. It doesn't happen often, but it happens often enough that I am a bit concerned exiting it. I know it's unowned because I can't collect it.  
---
It's not from my inventory -- I know there's a difference between dropping it and using it there. It's when I actually exit the power armor after being in it.
---
You weren't the guy with the platform with about 8 missile turrets and a generator set up outside the Whitesprings Golf Club windows were you? 
---
I was doing a mission there about an hour ago and hit the turrets with a stray bullet and they started attacking me, which is.. well just no. Don't build there (if that's you). So since I already had a bounty I stashed all my junk and grabbed my MIRV at the whitespring shops workshop and a half dozen nukes I needed gone and disassembled the whole camp to convey my feelings about building in that exact location. I didn't want my armor to get busted up so I was in just a swimsuit with a dose of medx and I was in pretty low health from the missiles incoming by time the camp owner showed up to shoot at me so I went right down. I quit instead of respwaning and was surprised to see I kept my bounty and caps. So maybe it wasn't you since you said you got the bounty. I got back on a new server and shot the first player I found and then stood still jumping up and down unarmed till they got the idea that they were getting a free 70 caps to get rid of my wanted level. First time I have ever been wanted, it was exciting.
---
You're taking massive damage 
---
Brilliant!
---
Unfortunately, yes. For some reason it turns in all of your technical data in your inventory regardless of how many you have in your inventory. It’s fairly annoying and I hope it’s a bug so that it gets fixed sooner or later. 
---
No fuck them I had to pay why give them a free ride if they are a stranger.
---
how please?
---
I did the same thing.  Next time I took my stack of 3, dropped them in a bag and did one at a time.
---
Being able to hang out and play with my friends without worrying about being griefed! But I’m extremely unenthusiastic about confrontation. Just not my gaming style. 
---
So, ebay.
---
Yesterday or two days ago all the "gaming" news media jumped on it. I'm personally excited that the gun crate has weaponized nuka cola ammo, hopefully that means we will get the squirt gun at some point
---
I have some legendary armour that gives like +1 Endurance. 
---
North of bolton greens, west of the savage divide
---
Get it out so that everyone starts doing it, causing another public relations social media nightmare.... this is the only way to force Bethesda to fix it asap.
---
Otherwise they'll take another month to get shit fixed.
---
I haven't found handmade plans yet, I don't think they fixed up this one yet
---
Ñame your price
---
You’re supposed to put a question mark at the end?
---
Do you have any idea how hard it is to manipulate Bethesda physics?
---
I could have a 20 tonne metal box propped up on one side by a metal support beam and when I pull the beam out the box launches into the sun and kills us all!
---
Is that what you want huh?  To kill us all?
---
You joke but it has happened. To a lot of people.
---
Here's an idea, find every video you can of duper tutorials and post them to @BethesdaSupport and the issues thread here, maybe if we flood these accounts with the proof they will get on it faster then the last couple dupes, taking weeks to fix a dupe while players leave the game in droves doesn't really help Bethesda much.
---
Next complaint will be to nerf players 
---
You don’t have to restart to get the perks you want. Once past lvl 50 you can swap out and get a new perk or change one special stat. 
---
For a rifleman, have all of the rifleman perks (expert, master...)
---
If you are looking to do sneaky stuff, get the agility perks that are relevant to stealth and stealth damage.
---
If stealth is not your thing, I would find other perk cards. I personally doubled up with shotgunner perks as my armor already took care of stealth.
---
As a non power armor user, you probably will want white knight 3 (armor breaks 90% slower) or other armor perks
---
As a rifleman, VATS will probably be one of your best friends. Invest in vats perks (ESPECIALLY if you are looking at stealth) (Covert operative...)
---
What do you expect a quest to be like? 
---
I'd be pleasantly surprised if they are allowed to answer or even comment on this
---
No you don't because there are dozens of boiled waters that you walked past the last time you played and didn't bother to grab them because you thought "I have a ton of purified water, why would I grab boiled" only to get angry at the game later when you need to get double the amount needed in dirty water, then spend the time to craft boiled, so that you can make a bowl of corn soup. And you got some rads for the effort, too. Bonus! 
---
Thought never occurred that you actually need all of those boiled waters you ignore, right? Right? It's okay...I was the same way until someone gave me this exact pep talk. Go on...it's right there on the shelf/table/corpse/fridge.
---
It's great early game.  Once I got enough Unyielding pieces and a chameleon plus the lower armor weight perks I swapped over.  Now i'm running bloodied Grognak's axe and 40% faster knuckles for melee.  The pistol was okay for robots but didn't scale as well.
---
Are you in an event?
---
I have 4000.       
---
1 cap per 2 bullets?
---
I'm guessing that it is a gating mechanic to slow down player progress, but that is just a guess.
---
I see. You're that type. I'll see myself out. Good luck with life. 
---
Yeah but it allows us to buy what would have been a free mod for only $20 dollars!
---
Why is everyone hating on me for liking this game!?
---
Thats what plasma grenades and molotov cocktails are for! ;)
---
I love my various sniper rifles and grenades! Them an a black powder pistol is all I need so far!
---
You lost 500 caps in your video though...
---
Seriously. 
---
Nothing beats the Power armour in blue vault paint (ULTRA MARINES!!!), with a Jet Pack and a two handed Axe or modded Sledgehammer.
---
I've been screaming "FOR THE EMPEROR" and flying up and down like an idiot whenever there's players nearby.
---
I’m not talking about a robot nod. I feel as though if they had actual npcs and a different quest setup that it would be more like the Dark Brotherhood - and a lot more enjoyable.
---
I already know that server files are never going to happen. The reason I created this thread is that so many people seem unaware of the reality of "private servers" for a game like FO76.
---
New gad (the lake)
---
Me neither, no luck yet .. Tried the patrol duty quest today and was disconnected just after activating it. I also though have been picking up recipes/plans I have no idea where to craft or use .. the last one I picked up was the Raider Rusty Knuckles … tried modifying regular knuckles at a bench, nothing new no skin no upgrade no nothing, can't craft anything new at any of the benches so dunno what it is .. also got a few other oddly named ones though I can't find either.
---
I was down at the south fissure site (PS4pro) about an hour ago with 4 SB on my tail and just ended up giving up in the end, but not for lack of response from the console, rather, my crappy gameplay. Even at level 58 I’m still a noob. Respawned back to camp and gave up for today.
---
 Bethesda really should have had a member of the ESO design team present when they were designing the systems for FO76. Would have helped avoid some if the problems we've had to and are still dealing with. 
---
Yeah I figured, however as u said, a lot of people have misconceptions, so wanted to add this somewhere, Ive posted it as replies to some people talking about all the mods they cant wait for. But was waiting for someone to post a thread like this, where my reply feels more useful
---
Speaking of knowing little about the game, the fireproof buff didn't magically add a mechanic. It just made it more accessible through perks. Since TSEs are more accessible than a couple of armor mods the thing you're whining about is moot.
---
An "even more predatory build" is nonsense. You've been able to make over 100% damage resistance builds since week 1 (not counting BETA since we didn't know all the affixes).
---
Hey does anyone know if this mod affects retrospectively.... or do I need to start a new toon/new collection?
---
There are literally hundreds of other games you could play. If youve gotten all the enjoyment you can out of this one, it's time to move on for a while. 
---
Hostile:   Feelings of opposition, unkindness, or unfriendliness toward something or someone.

You have been hostile from the jump.  He didnt notice something and you act like he commited a crime against you.

Currently I have managed to get the Chainsaw over 230 damage per tick with most of what I had up and running last week.  I am using this build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f17a36e&amp;d=ce0c81l71lu2sf2sv2sb2sa2pe0ek1eu0ee2cm2cu2ir2la2a02lt2sg2a12lg2&amp;w=&amp;n=Chainsaw%20Dmg/Tank%20Bld
---
I will have more details this coming week!
---
*FAT MAN STANDO*
---
But I'm not asking a question. 
---
Patrol Duty works at all levels, I have gotten the plans twice after level 50 
---
As far as I can tell, they are fine *for now*. When people were being banned for using cheat engine the community lead responding to the issue said that if a player was just using mods but not CE, to appeal and they would be reinstated. 
---
I have read through the code of conduct and terms of service and nothing within them explicitly bans mods. The link Septevar shared means that players should not file bug reports for problems caused by mods, "not supported" is different from "not allowed". 
---
It can be. You can get a SSD to make it faster I think. I looked up some comparisons for game loading times and they are considerably better with an external SSD and even better (by a few seconds maybe) with a new internal SSD replacement. PS4 Pro also slightly better with upgrades to SSD, extrernal or internal, internal being marginally better.
---
Yep, check out nexusmods.com and look up fallout 76 there. They have the mods broken down by type, and I think this one falls under interface. You'll have to dig through them but there aren't too many.
---
Each mod has instructions on how to install it, but it's basically putting a file in a directory and editing your custom fallout configuration file. PM me if you can't figure it out and you want to use discord or something for help.

4. I was just in the Charlston dump and got booted out and then had a wanted 10 caps slapped on me. When I reloaded back into a server the new server the dump was owned and I naturally was killed and lost all my loot.  WTF happened? I have zero interest in PVP and have never and would never (as it is not in my natural or gaming nature) to steal off another person (in game or otherwise).  Is it just me or have I just been dumb and tried to play the game and got screwed?
---
5. n/a
---
Yeah, this isn't an idea with any sort of immediacy attached to it. Certainly, that which you mentioned, as well server stability and ... possibly other things(?), would need to happen and be in-hand before this idea could effectively reach its primacy.
---
Yes, I would love mods too. The only problem is since Bethesda can't analyze every single mod you'd be letting a split come between public/private servers which they probably don't want.
---
This is the same reason why games like this never give out server files or the freedom for players to run their own servers. This is why I feel this is an important topic to discuss for the community.
---
I mean it all builds up to that moment, and there being a camp in the way would have been a total mood killer. I loved this quest, for the sake of others please move your C.A.M.P. 
---
Or at least build a tribute and have your camp showcase the scene (if that makes sense lol). That might be funny and cool if done well.
---
Good call. Thanks!
---
they only show up if your in an area where they can be placed otherwise you cant see or build them
---
Would a less obtrusive method of functionality be possible for any coders out there? 
---
Its good for pump shotties and hunting rifles 
---
Nuke zone fluxes are 12 copper each with Bargaining 3, 10 copper each at Bargaining 2
---
Go into a Nuke Zone with the Green Thumb perk and you farm around 60 fluxes in 10 minutes. The best place is Whitesprings since there's flowers EVERYWHERE.
---
10 minutes worth of work, and you have enough fluxes to max out 200 copper for all 5 faction vendors = easy 1000 copper per reset.
---
All accounts that enter that room, are being suspended immediately. And permanent bans coming. 
---
haha this was done using the new Air Guitar photo mode emote, just at an angle
---
Yeah, my disc needed a 50GB download.
---
Ok thanks
---
I can understand the frustration with having to deal with players outside of the scope of how you want to play, but how would envision this actually happening?
---
Remember eso is made by zenimax though. 
---
Got few hundred, maybe 400, from taking an owned workshop.  Previous owner set up a ton of turrets and other garbage, came there and tried to take the ws.  Turrets opened fire so I returned fire with my tse.  Destroyed all turret, killed owner multiple times and then finished off the rest of his structures.
---
But the holo tapes you listened to would have been recorded by NPCs, they explained what happened and combined with the notes made for a very enjoyable plot. Why would it have made any difference having a pre recorded person telling you that from a sprite in front of you compared to pre recorded people telling you information on a tape? 
---
You cant have more than one in your inventory. If you pick up more than one they will be always counted as one
---
Right? I didn't even realize I was missing this until just now. THANKS OP!
---
I have a bunch of 5.56 I’d trade for plastic or shotgun shells
---
I mean, we can? 
---
Try claiming georges junkyard workshop. The one east of vault 76.
---
You have to find one of the deceased members, there's one inside a bathroom in the Charleston Capitol Building, I think?
---
&gt; va
---
What exactly do you define as griefing?
---
Dunno, but I've used Custom.ini to do those things from the Beta onwards, no ban. It's quite common modifying method.
---
Because you also get an XP bonus.
---
I love sniping. Very effective, highest damage of any weapons I have. But I also keep a more rapid fire weapon on hand for when enemies are rushing at me. 
---
It's actually not intuitive at all.  Its the only thing like it in the entire game, not having some form of explanation on the item itself like everything else is the exact opposite of intuitive.   The only thing even comparable would be the power armor frame but there are things about that that arent even displayed in the stats screen so again not very intuitive.  Jumping down someones throat because they didnt notice something you did makes you an asshole not a hero grow up.
---
There is but I don't think we have a way to access it .. to see what I mean for instance shoot something and hit it then quickly gather water you'll see a message top left that says bullets were removed and water was added, so stuff is definitely logged but no UI for it for us.
---
I'm a melee build so this is super awkward. 
---
country roads   
---
let's a go

it's a me

this
---
also they could also be wanting to find your camp so they could destroy it (if they are a high level)
---
10 cuz I'm a good responder, ya'll just out here tryna knock down your fellow man
---
The first handful of times i fought the SBQ, i didn't have that great of weapons, only did about 250 damage using melee axe. 5-10 other people there, she would die within 10-15 mins max. The last 5-6 times, I now have a decent TSE gun , still plenty of other high level players there to help and we run out of time with 20-40% life left. Hopefully future updates will make some other good enemies to fight instead of these 2 places. I have launched on a few other sites thinking it might be decent and have been disappointed each time.
---
Jesus you're a toxic cranky person. Assassins sentenial armor has been around for most of the life of the game. The fireproof perk allows those who don't have access to the best pvp armor to stand a chance. No problem with that. 
---
&gt;Lmao. No source just like the "people can steal your weapons" 
---
&gt;Patchnotes: Trade: **We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.**
---
I disagree that it’s not intuitive. That of course was biased entirely on my own experience, I had no trouble figuring it out. I do agree that I was an asshole. For that, I apologize. 
---
Waiting for the events that Bethesda is releasing this month.
---
Also farming caps and buying all plans possible.
---
Camp castle still a work in progress.
---
Otherwise patiently waiting for my TSE gun to drop :(

---
The Bokeh in Fo4 gave me a headaches after an hour or so of play so really hope I can remove that stuff.
---
So I’m 98 right now. Just did the Mistress of Mistrry where you get Voice of sat and Blade. They’re only level 25?
---
ive edited my .ini files and have not been banned. 
---
Vendor inventory is different than the guy standing next to you.
---
No but there is a teired list for all mods i.e. you might scrap 100 get 1 each time for the first 10 but then take way more to get the rest
---
ps4 player here... not that bad? 
---
Atleast not compared to pre-patch bloodborne.
---
good to know 3rd person is better. but shouldnt matter.
---
Alpha site nuke is happening tonight if that camp spot is taken. Screw the queen.
---
any reason why? 😂
---
Thats what i figured people were doing. I needed the trophy for joining teams so i accepted several. Never had any problems and i could just travel to their camp to save money.
---
dude there is a building thing that spawns you on that point
---
I leave stuff in every cash register at the train stations. No weight limit on those. :)
---
How comes theres 0 documented proof other then the old folk lore? We're in 2019 and it's like spotting a ufo.
---
Sure a lot of people have seen them but why is there no proof? Some people will believe them others wont 
---
This game is piece of crap
---
Orbital striked some ones base because they took over my workshop
---
I blew Olivias head off and then took a photo. I managed to get her bloodied skull and eyeball in the pic too, it looks awesome. 
---
I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, just trying to understand. One of your problems with the game is grinding gear? Isn't that the point of all rpgs?
---
When someone ignores your request to join your team, most likely they have social anxiety or don't wish to click for some other reason, please leave them alone.
---
Concur.  I thought I was helping them out, they just wanted to start shit and damage my camp. Had to drop off and block.
---
I don’t have bandolier I dont carry all that around
---
I'm having the opposite issue... I've got enough Ballstic fibre, ultracite, adhesive than I can count... but I'm running out of screws.
---
Is there an auto version? Yet to see one.
---
to each his own 🤷‍♀️ 
---
My favorite is females play this game, hope to meet one some day. Least favorite is consistently running out of ammo because of all the goddamn meat sponges and respawning enemies over and over, also no account share is going to ultimately lead me to halt play then create a new character cause having to recollect all the plans/recipes I like are so hit and miss it's not worth starting a new character.
---
And yeah what the other poster says bugs and exploits yada yada too
---
yeah, I appreciate your response and I'm glad I'm not the only person who realizes private server operators aren't going to get the core server files which allow players to mix between private/public servers so easily.
---
But as you can see any real discussion about this game's future, even when leaving out such criticism gets blindly downvoted on this subreddit.
---
I've been using custom ini and texture, item sorting, and perk loadout mods since November and playing daily.
---
a good man
---
Oh right, that Yakuza fella is a real tank too. 
---
I can 1 for 1 with shells
---
I saved the picture to my desktop and now my game is uninstalled
---
Oh dang. Thanks
---
I think that I'm permanently drunk. I just got an achievement for picking up camps while intoxicated. Addictol didn't cure it though?
---
It also leaves options to further advance the story that Appalachia has been saved by the vault dwellers and repopulated in the future. The dev room exploit that was briefly out recently had a single human npc in it from what I hear which could be them toying with the ideas of bringing npc’s in as future content 
---
10 I broke into someones camp cause it was near where mine shouldve spawned. Who locks the door to their camp!?
---
I play as a Ultramarine screaming "FOR THE EMPEROR"... it's funny as hell.
---
You need the Blue Vault paint from the Atomic shop.
---
Jetpack and a 2 hander weapon so you become the "Assault Space Marine" from the Warhammer 40k universe.
---
Afaik, they haven't officially said which type of mods are allowed, or what can be altered.
---
That's pretty rad
---
Haha air guitar! I don't let anyone in my C.A.M.P without air guitar posing first. 
---
if only they allowed the anti-explosive damage power armor paint huh :P
---
Yeah I'm going to hunt down a few suits for the low levels that get killed. Gave away a Raider suit to a newbi one time at the Overseers camp.
---
Okay this is a toughy. The general rule of thumb is you pick one weapon type to specialize in. Most o the time you will also never ned the + damage perks unless it is an epeen flexing thing.   
---
I have a 203 heavy gunner with only one gun army and stabilized, I can still solo the queen just fine takes me a few minutes but the real winner and damage dealer is a chem named overdrive. I have a 100 that specialized in no weapon perks favoring charisma luck and intelligence  and I can kill everything pretty fast. I have a level 36 that has  no points in specials and I only use perk cards from the packs which is all 1 star for my 1 of each special  just to see how long it will take to level to 50 before I start any quests (events are fine) even.  I have gotten those 36 level in two days. It has been rough but it is fun as I like the challenge.   
---
So honestly play how you want you will not hinder anything or yourself aside from your ideal.   
---
I could toss builds at you all day some min/max some for maximum effort but in the end it is 100% on you and what you personally feel like doing.   
---
If you still want to see what I could cobble together I will for you, for an idea but you kind of have a bit going on for what you really want.   
---
its not a bug.. other than the it not showing how much u have in inventory.
---
turning in 1 TD will give like 300xp and 30 caps plus different loot from RNG
---
turning in 2 or more will give 400xp and 40 caps plus loot from RNG
---
you have to keep track of how much u have
---
A TSE sniper.... seriously I think that’s your only option lol
---
Well, good then. What does it even do for the person doing it? 
---
I’m on PS4 and I got either BSOD or disconnected probably 5 times in as many hours. I blame last minute dupers getting fucky before the patch drops.
---
I think there are a couple things about the dev room that Bethesda should definitely be ridiculed about.
---
Following
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
---
Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defences, take this beast out, and break their grip of Freehold
---
for what the 30 seconds they need to fast travel otherwise they are screwing up lone wander. 
---
Well usually a pvp fight starts at close range so sniper would be useless against a shotgun 
---
Unless you immediately kicked them from the team, the camp's defenses won't hurt them.
---
Cool that update would definitely bring me back to the game
---
Cool!! This is maybe what I am looking for
---
If you fuck up and hit Revenge instead of just spawning, you put quite a bit of caps on the line to make them automatically appear red and not need a slap exchange again.
---
Lost my entire wallet to a griefer close to game release when I didn't really understand the cap exchanging. It's stupid.
---
Only time I pvp is a bounty. I’m guaranteed first shot, and it always 1 shots lol
---
The negative effect from grounded doesn't get reduced. You get grounded=&gt; Your Gauss Rifle(is getting debuffed while dealing ballistic dmg), Tesla rifle, etc get useless
---
Can &lt;&gt; does
---
2.6k I basically I got really bored and wanted to get players to come after me for some fun my friend placed his camp and built a few walls he'd let me destroy them and then repair and repeat once my bounty was high enough I went into uncanny caverns and hid under the water and waited for players to come inside and hunt me I didn't fight back just hid 
---
they both were 
---
like mother like daughter
---
Yep, Bought a 2nd copy of the game just for this.  It def is hard as a non-duper when people see this because they assume what seems obv to them.  
---
ive got one mule for each main item category basically.  Think im going to level them all to 50 eventually.  i keep them all within reasonable weight, some slightly overencumbered.  hoping to dump a bunch of stuff when "bazaar" feature comes out.
---
Its so nice never having to throw away screws, springs or gears.  fun starting a new character with 50 of each junk.
---
Do you use fists with pa? May I see your build?
---
Revenge spawned instead of normal
---
The proof is literally in the dev's patchnotes.
---
I’m really confused: why can the community do things like this, and Beth can not? Why wouldn’t they included something like this in the game already?!?
---
My friend you are a genius. THERE ARE SO MANY. THEY ARE SO LOW LEVEL. Man. The axeman cometh.
---
They only show up at places such as workshops and camps that have a junk pile within the build limit. There are many junkyards that have at least one junk extractor. If you’re low level, I’d assume that you’re near Charleston and the southern part of the map. There is a junkyard near a energy plant down there. 
---
By actually fixing them, Explosive weapons are supposed to turn your damage to aoe, but currently it doubles your damage, combine that with your damage getting doubled by demo expert, surviving it is practicaly impossible
---
Do you have any proof of any kind?
---
Share it on twitter and share it to large video gaming organizations.
---
The only thing that will encourage hot fixes is terrible press, as a patch costs them money. 
---
Are you sure? You're probably gonna get lost.
---
https://m.imgur.com/9Rccgzd
---
Place your camp at one of these locations and you'll have the option to build an extractor. Junk locations appear as a Junk Pile in the game (bright red dots on the linked map). You can also get some junk by just interacting with the junk pile directly, at least once per day.
---
So far no, I modify my ini at least 3-4 times whenever I play … getting the darks/lights of colors/textures to look right is beginning to seem like an unattainable goal .. plus the bloom is redonk .. but so far the best notable changes have been under \[BlurShader\], \[BlurShaderHDR\], \[Weather\] plus you can modify the ragdolls so they don't slide down hills or go flying into the air.
---
private servers? the game is just Fo4 with multiplayer tackled on. it doesn't *have* to be always online and there's no content gated behind multiplayer.
---
I'd finally be able to play at my own pace without having to worry about some random asshole blasting my camp or initiating an event I'm interested in.
---
Exactly!  At a minimum tell us it can’t be placed and they are redirecting us to another server. 
---
So you're saying the game needs more solo or even co-op content? I can agree on that.
---
Id prefer a separate lock only because I have food water grenade and radaway on my favorites and sometimes I sell the extras I dont need.  But 100% this game needs a lock my son dropped my double tesla rifle and by the time I realized the bag was no where to be found.
---
You can wield the same TSE shotgun too right?
---
Is this always going to be the same cyclical response of "here's the most advantageous weapon in the game - Nerf it" until no weapon does any more damage than the other?
---
70, just once. Accidentally damaged a turret that some dolt put outside the whitesprings golf club windows. That gave me a 10 cap bounty. It was when I mini nuked the rest of the turrets that I got the rest. I switched servers and found some person to give the bounty to because I don't need the hassle.
---
This was debunked in the thread claiming exactly that
---
Fr I'm just tryna scrap my junk and maybe some weapons don't make me come through the roof 
---
I love the game, but yeah people have to be a tad realistic about some things, this is a completely different experience to the previous games, the same rules that applied to them dont apply here. 
---
And then dont forget there are consoles involved. so any mod is not only going to have to be approved for acceptable material (ie. no MTX items being re-released) but also performance - That is assuming that private servers and mod support is going to be available to the consoles and not just PC
---
Beat me to it! 
---
Strength effects melee. That's about it I think
---
? The only assholes that I have a problem with while roaming in my t 51b are those that cheat and use the 200+ bobblehead exploit (or just flat out overlooked by bethesda) .    
---
Seriously I can take 2-3 right now on xbox from a TSE pump or combat though an upclose double chumper that can kill me. 
---
I doubt it. The devs have said more than once that this game is "What if Fallout 4 was multiplayer?"
---
Only strength, affects melee damage
---
From what OP said the loot is no longer instanced for the supply drops.
---
I wonder if looting the drop will give additional bounty. If so, combined with the no longer instanced loot, would mean raiders wouldn't be able to get away with it without getting a bounty themselves.
---
Even without TSE weapons I one shot in PVP.
---
Now what?
---
&gt;toxic
---
and you're one of "those" people. Fireproof by itself does squat against a TSE shotgun. so nothing changes for the average player.
---
Thanks i will remove that
---
300
---
I intentionally got up to 100 to get other people's attention.
---
Had a big fight at my CAMP and I noticed 2 of the attackers had CAMPs relatively close to mine. It was basically a big battle of all of us going back and forth attacking each other's bases while trying to kill one another.
---
Fun as hell.
---
I found that!! Thanks for solving the mystery!
---
Dude I love you I apologize if I came in to harsh this was an amazing response thank you for having a measured response to someone like me challenging your comment.
---
Why would it?   The dog never did any science, and no chemistry in particular.   But mister Peabody did do science, and was depicted holding vials and beakers.   Which are found in the doghouse.
---
But Dad if you're the police, who will police the police?
---
I don't mind grinding gear at all. I have ground out many sets of gear in many games through the years. Some of the best in some games, that was no cakewalk. You have a clear path to getting exactly what you want. Some boss drops the loot you want. You know you go after that boss. Kill them 5 times, 10 times, 100 times, whatever. In this it all seems to me completely random. There's something about it that just makes me feel uncomfortable about wasting my time on it without knowing if the mob even drops the item or if it has the chance to drop all items in the big RNG lottery. And I don't buy lottery tickets because it's a waste of money. And I don't gamble unless I can increase my odds.
---
I've literally never had to seek it out. Just know not to bulk and sell it when cleaning stash. Always had a supply around yours. White knight is the shiiiit
---
12,000 is my highest, the joke was on them I had zero caps on me so all it did was make me bankrupt for 4 hours. 
---
Yup, ever since the patch it wraps while going down but not up, wrong direction imo, up would work so much better when wanting to sell 4 of a stack of 100+
---
Other than mutation serums and ultracite mod plans she's pointless to kill. Once you get a good build and good weapons you kill her insanely easy but it's not worth the 10 minutes a silo run takes since you could be farming whitesprings.
---
I personally never found a duper. I sure as hell looked every time a server lagged out. I honestly suspect these people that “found the dupers” made that shit up or harassed some dude playing with their low level friend lol. Funny how none of them ever took a minute to screenshot all the duped items they supposedly caught them with. 
---
God damn watching your temper tantrum is really entertaining
---
Yeah i saw it too, i can remember at least 2 times in which i didn't get slap damage and just got instantly killed by TSE weapons but i thought "its not the weapon damage, there must be something more to it".
---
Strength affects melee, and Luck affects your crits, but it mostly comes down to which perk cards you use.
---
Equip class freak 
---
It’s never going to stop either. Look at GTA Online, every single update to that game adds new duplication glitches that don’t get patched for a month 
---
And his friends.
---
I think it was for 2077
---
wow very whelmed 
---
Source?
---
Old news, and good work by Bethesda.
---
It changes everything for low level and casual play built for PVE. That's the crowd that wants TSE nerfed.
---
It didn't nerf anything, it just made explosive resistance more accessible. That's the point.
---
~600, some turd was killing my buddy’s house because he wanted his spot, the guy ended up moving is house as close as he could to my buddy for whatever reason so I logged on killed him, and his camp, a few times Then I just gave my buddy the 600 caps lol. 
---
This
---
There's a little trick- you can sort your armor by value, it helped me pick out my 2 empty chassis' earlier today. ( They were together, several slots below the filled ones.)
---
If there’s anything I’ve  learned in life it’s that I am sometimes (often) wrong. When that happens a humble answer is best. 
---
Your response was fine. Nothing to apologize for there. 
---
Thanks for this!
---
This is what I'm currently working towards. the pipe revolver and pipe bolt action gain the benefit of both rifle and pistol perks, so like gun runner is active all the time etc, plus cheap to repair and slow to break.

---
This whole "Bethesda won't fix it until we raise a stink" is a self fulfilling prophecy. 
---
This is what i want most right now.
---
My implementation ideas are two small mats, about as big in area as a player could reasonably stand on. Maybe they cost similar crafting material as in FO4. But i think there should be two mats. 
---
One may for all players. And a supplemental more rare welcome mat for the camp own specifically.
---
Or a permanent-team/factional Mat. 
---
Not ruling out trapping people with this method. But in my camp i wanna spawn in my walls, now in my razor grain where the radrats are always. 
---
a tse shotgun will still kill you in one shot regardless of Fireproof.
---
10 after they changed the supply drop to be a locked container.
---
Where is this?
---
I see what you mean, thanks for clarifying. I agree with you, they just didn't release enough "bosses" to give specific loot, I assume. 
---
I thought radshield suppressed mutations now?
---
I get the building names confused lol. And wow I didn't even know about those. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Are you playing in fullscreen? 
---
Yup got lucky a couple of times, thank you ppl that do this!
---
Nope. They're literally deleting anything in peoples inventories that is an unreleased piece. Can find people saying the Room bans are happening, but the people the items would be offloaded to maintained. 
---
Those items were purged as well. No bans for those with them second hand, but they're gone. Much easier to delete items across the board when the item ID is simple to pick up as each one is illegitimate. Clear all player inventories with this item, bam done. 
---
Weapons and such? No, too basic, in game, propagated, no unique owner ID.
---
Nothing i mentioned is built in "defenses" traps (tesla coil, rad emitter, punji board) all damage anything, regardless of team affiliation. I can suicide via my camp rad emitters. 
---
The environmental ideas even more so. Only defense to a cliff spawn trap would be power armor. 
---
That's true. But the dog's name IS Einstein and was owned by a scientist. Which is why I'm saying it is also a possibility :P
---
I think it looks pretty good actually. Your strength perks look perfect to me, that’s exactly what I run on my 2H melee. Perception is fine since they’re aren’t a lot of good perks for melee builds. I’ll usually run glowsight in case I run into glowing enemies. 
---
I would drop endurance down to 5 and just run ironclad because I don’t feel like the extra health is actually super helpful. I’d bump charisma up to 4 and run Lonewander 4 for the extra DR. Intelligence looks good. Agility and luck both are good, but two perks that I’ve found that are great for getting some extra toughness are Dodgy and Ricochet. With how high your agility is, dodgy should be great, especially if you pair it with action boy/girl. 
---
And ricochet is amazing perk that I feel is undervalued. Even just rank one is great for helping against those super mutants and colonel gutsy that seem to shred my non-PA melee build. It also seems to activate way more often than the 6% chance that is on the card. I’ll have it activate at least two or three times a fight just at rank two and sometimes even more. 
---
I love Hunter hunted the problem is that at level 160 almost everything I do is either in a silo meaning I don't want to be interrupted or server hopping for rare shit and trades. It's rare that I'm just chilling in a server with nothing going on and can tune in.
---
that's a mod for the combat armor not the armor itself.
---
Didn’t even know that existed since pvp is so rare in this game. That would explain how they managed to pull off multiple kills as well with no slap damage. And there could very well be some sort of misunderstanding as to how they were able to be killed in the first place since there still seems to be no actual video evidence in favor of what’s being described. In fact, only video evidence [against it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af6kei/comment/edw2m98?st=JQVNM81I&amp;sh=05529254)
---
Thanks. That at least makes me want to continue on. Even if it is like 5 hours by now. xD
---
Any disconnect has a small chance of a brief rollback.
---
They said they were going to include it but I didn't see it in the patch notes so I'm assuming they didn't yet. I'm still seeing radium rifle plans every time I go to the watoga station. I did get a rare plan today but it was the gatling gun.
---
I'm hoping this is something that will get fixed server side and not require a wait till the next patch.
---
I'm playing however it default boots to. Should I try windowed instead?
---
I use overseers caches, mostly flatwoods bc low level players can have opportunities. But always check, if you can use a plan or my excess junk, take it. 
---
If you use an exploit to do something you're not supposed to or go somewhere you're not supposed to you can be banned.  Does no one read the Code of Conduct or Terms of Service?  People are going to end up as a Human CentiPad.
---
That's a pretty bad change
---
I found a couple dupers but not this patch. Last patch if the server lagged badly I'd look for 2+ people in close proximity not moving and sure enough they're duping. But since then I have not found it  I think something is just wrong on Beth's side and not player made errors. But who knows 
---
I know there are people that group just for the bonus but don't do stuff together.
---
Same! I'd be willing to donate to the cause. 
---
I may or may not have taken the head off of her corpse.
---
What a sad life you must have to spend it  reading (and replying to!) a subreddit for a game the you didn’t buy, have never played, and clearly hate. 
---
Another spawns in the dried up stream east of the Gorge Junkyard

If you have trouble being spotted 1 star unyielding gear can pump agility and solve your problems.
---
I found it necessary to make this playlist as every other 76 playlist seemed to contain alternate versions of some songs. Every song on here is not only the correct artist, but the correct recording of the song, since multiple recordings exist. The last few songs wernt available on spotify at all, sorry.
---
Well, these guys dont really know how to find dupers.  If it was a stash, they should have waited to steal the loot and throw it away or give it away.    This isn't really taking it too far, but it's a horrible job at finding dupers.
---
I think that being able to interact with the events and impact the outcome more directly rather than listening to to the story. Although I must admit that it was fairly interested hearing it. However, the fact that the main point of the quest was to go around, listen to holographs, and find and craft some stuff was pretty mundane in my opinion.
---
They do tell you when it can't be placed and its simple to relog. 
---
I found that i had to go into nvidia control panel and make sure it was using my card as default for fo76, as it was set to use my default card instead.  You might check that.  I was crashing every time i went into an interior, and that fixed it for me. 
---
Awesome! Glad to hear it worked! 
---
I don't know why no one has mentioned this but here goes (hoping this isn't a mistake to be fixed): the Marine helmet takes 1 plastic, 3 rubber and 1 glass to make and weighs 0.1. With Hard Bargain 3 it is worth 28 caps. 
---
You do the math.
---
not the original commenter but here you go
---
https://twitter.com/GamesNosh/status/1084591053435531265
---
I must have looked dozens of times during lag spikes and never once did I see anything like what the dupers were described as. How do you know they were dupers? Did you actually go over there and watch them? Or do you assume because it fit the description?
---
Looks like he will fuck your shit up
---
Mine max out at 5. But every single time I check it, there is 5. I just have one industrial purifier, with 15 power running to it
---
It is crazy that you all think you're the first to alert Bethesda to this. They know...they can't fix it. 
---
I’m a 2 hand melee build, sadly I can’t post with my All Rise
---
This.
---
Hmm when I have punji boards set up at my camp or when my team mates have them in their camps, they never hurt me.  I'm not sure how it works I guess.  You're right, there are environmental things I didn't really think of.
---
I find it kinda funny that this is a spoiler to the end of the quest, because I actually stumbled upon these bodies once and I had no clue what they were there for. I think I was running away from a bunch of high-level supermutants when I reached the edge of this cliff and thought "Why are there two dead women spooning with identical dresses?"
---
Really? I thought Herd Mentality wasn’t affected by Class Freak previously? Did they fix this?
---
I've accepted a couple of invites and the people never fast traveled anywhere near me.  They stayed on the other side of the map filling my hud up with all of their quests. 
---
I literally went over and watched them deposit all there stuff in. I always try and take as much as I can and get rid of it but theyd save at least one of whatever. I hate explosive weapons so much. Way too overpowered. 
---
I appreciate what you're saying, even though I agree with at least some of your sentiments, I created this thread because the topic of want/need/desire/delivery when it comes to private servers has never been fully discussed.
---
I love the entitlement, 'I agreed to the TOS, ignored it and abused a glitch that requires 3rd party mods of questionable nature to achieve and bethesda banned me, reeeeeeeee'
---
Oh he will!  Being I just platinum FO76
---
It might need to be checked, but I dont believe einstein the dog had a doghouse.   Didnt he just live in the house?
---
every time I get a legendary armor it shows me all the armor I have that's legendary in screen blocking pop-ups. Fighting the Scorch Queen is the worst for this, it took 3 minutes to run through all my gear and the stuff I acquired because each new item I received started the whole cycle over again.
---
The best part of MODUS was his interaction with ZAX. It just shows you how.. Human.. They are, for lack of a better word. The grafton Mayer, prison Warden, and AIs like that can clearly adapt to their surroundings and in essence, have flourished without us. I like that they have human qualities, so for me it kinda makes up for the lack of humans. If they eventually add them (as vaults open up, for example) I hope they are as fleshed out and enjoyable as npcs in the past. I kind of enjoy the lonely ambiance though.
---
Rose was good but then she just serves no purpose after the quest line. 
---
10 Early game like 2 days after release. Defended someone else's workshop at the junkyard for the event then wandered about picking stuff up, found locked ammo crate so I picked it -bam! Wanted 10 caps! Then to rub salt in the wound the Damn crate was empty. Learnt immediately if someone owns a workshop don't pick anything in the immediate area.
---
Remove until you lose the one you dislike, buy the remaining at approximately 500cp and slap on starched genes and class freak, both fully built.
---
So banning them for something they POSSIBLY did is ok in your eyes? They didnt even have proof. They are going to make the person write where they went. You didn't even read it. 
---
Grafton Station. The vendor sells the plans. I got a full set from him through plenty of server hopping. Good luck!
---
Add me level 24 TheMeiserVader
---
Its for the excavator if there isn't a name listed and it scraps into black titanium
---
If a mod doesnt specify a model then its for excavator.
---
Just to be clear, BOS is the top material upgrade for combat armor.
---
If you want Bethesda to see this, don’t post it on Reddit, contact them directly.  Do they still have forums?  Use those.
---
If you accept a team invite to an unknown player's team you never know what you're walking into anyway.  Better off going to your own camp and dropping your junk before going to theirs just in case. If people don't think of doing that then they'll learn quick.
---
It's totally cool. I more wanted to talk up a TTW...fucking amazing mod. 
---
Good on Bethesda. This is exactly how they should be handling this situation.
---
hoard them all! Esp springs
---
Mic please? 
---
Good on Bethesda. This is exactly how they should be handling this situation. 
---
Randomly destroying other people’s CAMPs. 
---
It's a EE from fallout 2
---
Stealing this.  I thank you 
---
NO THEY ARE NOT   
---
First it was the overweight glitch 
---
then it was duping 1.0
---
now it is duping 2.0?   
---
Absolutely not. This has been an issue since release , before the weight and duping issues.   
---
If their architecture for their servers (or the code) is so bad that people disconnecting at the same time can cause others to disconnect then they are seriously fucked up.  
---
LOL True!
---
They are not randomly banning people.  They can see what people have.  If they got something from a developer's room it's not hard to guess that the person used an exploit.
---
Okay and what does this have to do with people that play lone wander or strictly in private groups? Why should I let someone piggyback off me for free?   
---
I spent the 36 caps to get X place you can do the same or pay me.   
---
Oh and double fuck them as they don't ask they just toss a invite out on xbox, they could take the 10 seconds and ask in message either by voice or text. But no these lazy cheapskate want shit for free and just spam invites, then they have the audacity to get mad and send a message about how I shouldn't be an ass. Well bitch obviously you got thumbs to text that but not an ounce of decorum to ask first.  
---
My guess if you fall into the latter category of people. 
---
Good strategy for assaultrons is Enforcer + Concentrated Fire. One VATS assisted headshot with a shotgun will disable their head laser. 
---
You can also knock out their limbs, but be aware they will try to stuff destruct on you if you disable all their weapons.
---
Im sorry I dont have one yet, i just moved and didnt bring it. I would love one of those handmades. What about 1000 caps?
---
then you should know the price?
---
Thanks I literally just found it as you replied.
---
Its SO dubious that I dunno if its true or not.
---
People are getting banned for this and that, but why do people who are selling massive amounts of items still ongoing? 
---
Friends who roll with nearly every 76 mod are still playing?
---
Perhaps theres so many Bethesda cant keep up? Guess we'll never know.
---
10 being what? 
---
15 being what? 
---
25 being what? 
---
Disregard. I seemed to have missed the *Legendary* in your post. 
---
I've been getting a lot of legendaries from Whitesprings glowing ones when it gets nuked.
---
Maybe Bethesda removed the FO4 welcome mat because it would be too easy to create Death-Traps for other players. Move the welcome mat into a "death box", summon random players for "trade", then kill them...
---
Just speculating.
---
Radium Rifle was my FO4 go to. I am just waiting for a good enough drop to move everything over to it. Looks like I'll probably be waiting for a nice long time with all these shotguns.
---
The mods for the poon gun can't be learned by scrapping, save the scope. The gun plans are at Harper's ferry though if you still care however I believe they are level locked there. The mods are not uncommon to find at vendors though.
---
Oh no, they have proof and they know they went there, that's what server logs are for. What they are looking for is the specific sequence of actions used to get there so they can patch the issue. Obviously they thought there wasn't a way for players to get there and if the people help them figure out how it is happening they may show leniency.
---
This stuff is pretty easy, don't use exploits and don't go to areas that need obiously weren't intended to be accessible.
---
It's really nice of Bethesda to even consider unbanning at all.
---
Also worth noting that sometimes you can take a damaged part of your camp, store it, and place it full health.
---
You can even move your camp and all your destroyed stuff magically comes back fully repaired. 
---
As other have stated no name = excavator   
---
Though plans will say excavator so if looking for those on vendors make sure to read.
---
Why tf are you people still playing this game
---
Thank you both!
---
Pffft. Speak for yourself. I wore the Tattered Dress since level 10 for that sweet PER bonus. 
---
I still dont have grognaks axe.  Where did it drop for you ? Been running lvl 50 All Rise 
---
So recently I was browsing player auctions website and saw the dupers selling it for $50 which tells me its REALLY rare.  
---
Then I saw a YT video about players getting banned from accessing a "devs room" room that has everything in the game, (even ATOM Shop items). This room has items you shouldnt be able to get.  
---
Putting 2 and 2 together would suggest that this is how they got it and the only way to get it is from cheating yourself into the devs room or buying it from someone who has. Even having it in your inventory would risk your account so I'm not sure if its worth pursuing.
---
Complete solitude.
---
I use rifleman (standard, expert &amp; master) but only level 1 of each. The first levels have the most outcome per point (10% damage each). For damage boost i have glow sight against tough enemies and use a shotgun with enforcer to cripple and keep a healthy distance to charging enemies. I like pistols too, but find them too expensive to invest in to make viable secondaries.
---
To be honest I’d be ok if they just some how disabled everyone from joining a server and allowed us to play single player till they figure it out.
---
Yeah you get the BoS mod at Grafton vendors. I think at both the Station and in town if you want two tries per server hop. Legendary Combat Armor is difficult to farm for, but you can get 1 piece of Heavy 1 star sometimes as a reward for doing the Halloween thing at Watoga.
---
I seem to get a lot from the queen
---
I would like private servers for role-playing, that is all. 
---
&gt; I read reports
---
Were these official reports located in the nothing-but-facts dispensary that is reddit's comments?
---
This worked like a charm took 4 tries but got it.  Thanks 
---
Id do 100 each for those 2
---
Ah I get it now they make a shit game give out pure shit service. Fuck over peoples accounts and private info but that's fine as long as you don't "possibly" without proof go into one and have it happen to you. Good job you cuck apologist. Figured I was wasting my time letting people know they can get fucked over at anytime. But this forums is mostly retards who will take anything you give them. So downvote away. Hope your accounts get banned without proof. 
---
Matter of fact go ahead and ban this post mods. While you enjoy your bait and switch bag, shit plastic RIP off bottle. While playing your buggy broke game. And price cuts for items that haven't been on sale before. 
---
Remove the quad shot gun and yes on the two shot 
---
I feel the same way, paid for the Tricentennial edition, in CAD, and then saw it a week after launch at a quarter the price I paid. Bethesdas response is to give us the games we got by preordering 76, I want my cash back, the difference between the edition I bought and the hacked to bargain bin price it sold at.
---
This is a bug from Fallout 4, maybe even earlier. Fortunately, it seems to be much more rare in Fo76 than it was in Fallout 4, so there is *some* improvement.
---
oof
---
I too also have my C.A.M.P set there but the other comments have made me reconsider moving it especially as i am i have a farm set up there. The problem is that it is such a nice location with a beautiful view. I'll probably search some more along the ridge line for another location.
---
Hey! I’ll join up. RotoDAP 
---
Not necessarily. I got the helmet and can craft them. Just learnt about this issue today. Never been to the dev room. People are giving them out and you can learn the recipe from scrapping them.
---
Ty! How much for shotty?
---
Not worth it
---
This isn't the only game with that feature. You have a general health bar and an unseen incapacitated health bar. You can take enough damage to wipe out both pretty easily depending on what you're fighting. 
---
Bwhahhaa. New player from me in discussing getting some help from me: "Ill come to that place to help you. Thats a good place for clipboards."
---
New player "The hell do you want with crappy clipboards?". You can have them ALL.
---
Me: gladly. And all the fans. 
---
That’s my baby lol 
---
There are some PA builds that need springs and screws, even to repair. Once you’ve built those you only need a reserve for repairs ( unless you built a lower level set of armor and need to start over building a higher level set) 
---
After collecting one set of each I only keep my excavator armor and X-01. 
---
I can’t thing of anything else that needs so many, maybe some high end power plants or turrets.
---
Video or GTFO
---
Yeah, totally agree. Bethesda owes the pre-order crowd an explanation and a refund/make good on this
---
Have another short that’s the same but no explosive 
---
Items they loot are being dumped onto mule accounts. Bethesda can only determine if an account has entered the dev area, so mules can't be detected.
---
Haha fair. Thanks again my friend i'll put it to good use!
---
percent?
---
Then you wont be banned, pretty simple.
---
How does your ap actually regen,
---
I'm struggling with my VATS character because the ap just stops regenerating periodically for apparently no reason
---
Zenimax Online which is owned by Zenimax which owns Bethesda. 
---
Is it possible to pinpoint where the spawn is and build a platform 
---
True, I don’t think competent people start writing on the literal edge of the paper, whether it’s apocalyptic times or not. 
---
Along with Fire Proof, Dodgy 3 and Lone Wanderer 3.
---
I was skeptical about Dodgy for the longest time but it does amazing to reduce damage when paired with other similar perks and effects. 
---
I appreciate what you're trying to do here... but man that title makes me angry.
---
Shannon was definitely not a "self entitled cunt" as you say. She took in a bunch of orphaned girls and used the tools at her disposal to try and make some sense and structure in the messed up world after the bombs fell.
---
Oh she made mistakes, one being not spending enough time  and attention to her daughter, and those mistakes were disastrous in the end, but Olivia couldn't handle that her mother had other wards in her care and that she was no longer number one. 
---
Instead of confronting he mother and discussing her issues, she made a deal with the devil to tear down and murder everyone she knew.
---
*sigh* Both the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah River also lie within the borders of WV. Not by much, but they're still in the state.
---
I will most likely never platinum the game since there are a couple for killing other players. I think there are only 3 that i haven't collected
---
oh man, I'm not going to get into this with you.
---
have a good one
---
Same here, but I got 3 in perception for lockpick. Swap those babies out for 3 level 1 commando perks and I got a designated smg for Scorchbeasts. Take it to half before it lands and smack it twice. Rinse and repeat. 
---
This is already possible (if you are so lucky)
---
More than a few players on this subreddit (myself included) have reported encountering a server barren of any other players.
---
Sadly, rather than feeling the game is absent of its key component: other players (at least that's what Bethesda advertised as being important in the game). All the quests/workshops/vendors work the exact same with or without other players, so what you're asking is actually possible, albeit, without consideration for when you actually ask for it, you have to rely on luck right now.
---
(I'm obviously not suggesting this player's request is already fulfilled by the game, it isn't. However, this player's request is currently technically possible to experience with or without any player input and can happen purely by chance)

I'm not against the idea. But given Bethesda's recent reputation, I'm a tad afraid they might somehow screw it up. 
---
Because we enjoy it. Why are you wasting your time berating us for it?
---
[Pride And Joy](https://youtu.be/NU0MF8pwktg)
---
Glorious :)
---
*So, I've been somewhat paying attention to this game. Is it worth buying in its current state? It at least looks pretty fun.*
---
I'm just saying that if that's your outlook on it, basically all video games can be boiled down to find some stuff, listen to NPCs, craft some stuff and come back to listen to the NPCs some more. 
---
I think one way this could be help is with current events too.
---
They should add a current timer on events when you hover over them on the map.
---
Nothing hurts more than wasting caps and waiting through a loading screen to jump in a mission with 10 seconds left
---
A LAR is another reason for  .45 ammo. 👍
---
Good riddance.
---
The ppl banned wont explain you have to modify the memory of the game to get it spawned.
---
The only est to do that is cheat engine 
---
I would like to know what demographic of the Fallout community made them think we wanted a PvP version of the game, every player I know of who has been playing these since Fallout 3 is very displeased with the PvP aspect of this iteration of the franchise. An event where PvP could take place in an arena and players could bet caps on their fave player would have worked much better, kind of like the arena in Oblivion.
---
Part of me thinks this is another case of the trade stealing "glitch". It never existed in the first place, but it got popular because people are careless. If you're too aggressive trying to get into trade and mash buttons, you can fuck up and list something at 0 caps very quickly. I imagine like, 3 people with keyboard spamming issues had it happen. Makes sense though, the trade window opens way fast, could totally happen. They were likely confused as to what just happened, and logic would point you to it being a likely bug. Boom, huge rumor that stained the game for a week.
---
Here we have a pvp system with VERY vague rule introduction. I had the same issue as these folk back in BETA. Got mad at a guy taking my workshop in full PA when I was level 12. Died against his brick wall until I was at 0 caps and had a debuff on damage to players. Thought the workshop area allowed essentially constant pvp. Yeah nooo. 
---
Was a bad feeling. 
---
Slap damage exchange is confusing as well if you're not already aware of it. Could totally see people saying they got one shotted or something when they might've not had pacifist on and let a stray bullet tag a player they weren't aware of. I don't know. 
---
I've tried the Bobblehead trick with 5 unarmed +25% damage I'd stashed away. 0 extra damage after the first. People are saying it's all of the damage bobbleheads, then they say it's only explosive or something. 
---
The body at the entrance of vault 76. I fast travel there and drop plans, ammo and such. I often use it as a way into the Forest.
---
Okay managed to find it.  Thanks :)
---
Many thanks! 
---
Duplication glitches are never easy to stop once they have been found. You can't just attack the devs for not doing anything about it because they are attempting to patch it, it just isn't working. Look at GTA online - that game has always had car duplication glitches, always patched and always new ones found. Minecraft too. I'm sure theres others I cba to think of.
---
Unyielding for me, things can't hurt you if they can't see you including aoe. So the agility from unyielding is dope
---
Check a weapon crafting station, under Crafting. In the appropriate weapon category, you’ll see a recipe for Voice of Set or Blade of Bastet. One of the crafting components is the weapon itself. Craft it like any other weapon, and it will give you the option to select its level (for more materials as level rises).  
---
It’s a neat option, but the trade off appears to be that you can’t make any weapons mods to them. 
---
I did this randomly to get the join 20 teams trophy. People would accept then I just jump servers and do it again till trophy popped. I never thought about the free fast travel lol. 
---
supposed to get a special point every level up to 50.
---
It happened to me once.  I like being alone.  Anti-social people unite!  Um.....no...never mind.  :)
---
Added ya pal good timing to I was just about to log off lol (2am here )  
---
While I strongly dislike any abusive conduct, I seriously doubt many people read the TOS, and those that do may not fully comprehend the legal terms. 
---
However every player should know that glitching and third party tools will get you banned. It's common sense.
---
Now I want to be able to call in a vertibird, have it lower a big magnet on a cable, and snatch me up without even slowing down. Then I could press a button to release the magnet and smash down wherever I want. Damn that would be sick. 
---
Tactical assessment: Red Chinese victory—impossible.
---
I had this problem too. Bump. Only fix was log out completely and restart game
---
Start new char. Then load old save
---
Check a weapons station. There’s a recipe to recraft them. 
---
I think it might be even. Pipe and rifles for mutants. Shotguns and rifles for scortched. 
---
Thank you, at least I know it's not just me
---
I want as well
---
Fissure Prime to spawn the QUEEEEEEEN.
---
You can also occasionally but kind of rarely get the BoS plans from Harpers Ferry vendor. MAYBE Super Duper mart, but I highly doubt that one.
---
But just try to farm up whatever Combat Armor (heavy recommended) you can find during a whitesprings nuke.
---
Ark
---
No this was yesterday and i dont have my camp near the golf club its on a cliff overlooking the dam :).
---
I dont blame you for doing what you did.
---
The people who build to horde xp and kills at whitesprings is so bad i would wreck it too.
---
And good luck to you out there :).
---
AP regen stops for a short time if you do anything that uses it like jump, hit vats, sprint, etc
---
Nah I just closed the game from Xbox and restarted 76 was back in no problem after but don’t know why I couldn’t respawn 
---
Well done! Looks cozy :D
---
The same reason people still play any game, because they enjoy it. Why do you feel the need to be a negative Nancy about it 
---
thankyou kind sir ;).
---
I thought it was pretty good timing that i just got access to my 2se and they decide to mess with my home lol :)
---
Haha you can't be serious. You're a maniac for this one. Loving it!
---
The only thing I dont like sometimes is "why do I never have any AP?!?"... oh wait.
---
What are the blue wall plans? I've seen a lot of people with them but dont kjow what the plan is called. 
---
Something like this happened to me while fighting the SBQ. There was a prompt to respawn but no locations showed up on the map to actually respawn at. I was only able to respawn to my friend I was playing with. If I wasn't on a team with my friend then there would have been no way to actually respawn. 
---
Let me get this straight.
---
First it was the infinite carry glitch that was causing server instability.
---
Then it was the dupe glitch that was causing it.
---
Now that both those have been fixed, and the servers are still shit, you want us to believe it's because of another glitch? Could it be that the servers are just shit? Why do the people that are white knighting this game so hard keep coming up with stuff to shift the blame off of Bethesda? 
---
Spoken like a raider lol my usual targets for a raid are exactly this demographic. 
---
Out in the wilderness, check
---
Has gone to a location on their own recently, better if they're near a big loot or scavenging spot, check.
---
Walk up and offer my wasteland workshop nearby, act all innocent and proud of my camp build, check. 
---
Then they walk into my burn clinic and get radiation and flamethrower traps. If they come back hostile then the fight is on. If they come back and flash the confused emote i explain the trap and build method and let them retrieve their junk. 
---
Someone exploiting certain glitches to duplicate items, I think. 
---
Is there a higher res version of that picture? I can’t see anything when I zoom in. And it’s quite hard to tell what’s going on zoomed out 
---
the mod is just called calibrated shocks without a PA designation to it like T-45 or T-51b, just look for the mod to scrap to 2 pieces of black titanium and you have an excavator version.
---
They already added a sort of feature like this upon popular request, if you log in and your camp can't be placed, just log out and back in. 
---
I'm not justifying the actions of the dupe hunters, just explaining why, in this case it was a perfect storm of circumstances that looked awfully suspicious as it very closely resembled known duper behavior. 
---
Yep, definitely takes getting used to. Doing what you can to increase AP refresh speed helps a lot tho.
---
Or you can jus relog
---
You always spawn in the same reference to where the CAMP is physically places, not the dome you claim.  You have to move the CAMP object, itself.  Every time you move it, your fast travel landing point moves in the exact same direction UNLESS its at the edge of the camp bubble, then it'll attempt to spawn you to the closest space within the area that isn't out of bounds.
---
Move your camp around, do NOT re-place it via the pip boy, just pick it up when you're in build mode and slide it ten feet in any direction.  Walk for five seconds away from your camp, fast travel back to it.  Repeat.  You will always land in the same spot, and that spot will always move in the same ways you move the camp object itself.
---
I still say Vault Tec had a major share of stock in every company you see in game, effectively making them a monopoly. 
---
Idk why you didn't just answer the question from the beginning. These are pretty good points, and I agree that it seems like cheating at the game in the sense that it is much easier, but there were actual cheats (console commands) in the other fallouts too. In your response to your previous comments, just because someone can store more than you doesn't really give them an advantage over you because you aren't competing. Also I don't think anyone said duping items was ok, but all of your points still seem pretty valid. I guess it just feels like you're looking at the game more as competing against other players on the "unfair advantages".
---
Thanks, you gave me a new flexibility to my build. 
---
Not even to reddit!
---
I don't disagree but what is funny about this is that Bethesda doesn't know how it happened so they keeping the account suspended until the person tells them how he did it. "we will unban you if you tell us how you did the thing we banned you for." Cmon, that is some funny shit.
---
Funny not even a map was showing up for me pressing start did nothing I was stuck looking at my dead corpse as the camera just circled around it
---
Sounds exactly like a Mule/Stash.
---
I wouldn't say it's fixed. It causes issues. Moreso the positive part of it does. Herd mentality and class freak break Barbarian and Evade. Something about fractions of stats, I'm not sure. Also makes charisma act odd, like if you have 9 charisma it will let you share a level 3 perk until you leave the perk screen. Then it unshares. I think it also affects strange in numbers weirdly. If I have it equipped while solo, my mutations won't work at all.
---
BUT. For as long as I've had it Class Freak 3 completely gets rid of it's negative. I'm on the edge about it being worth it because of it's issues though.
---
I've played quite a few mmo's, whenever there's a ban wave, you get tons of people posting on forums how unfairly they were treated.
---
This is a fantastic intro to "Fallout 76 Parody Gangbangs 1", the sexual tension is palpable!
---
Didn't do the excavator quest yet, will do for completion but will probably not use the PA itself. I heard the x01is the best you can have. Will i be able to craft it later by questing, or is it bound to lucky drops for the plans? Asking because i bought a lvl 50 x01 chest with jet pack mod from a vendor. Bought it for the attached mod and to have the hunt for a jetpack off my chest, unsure if i should buy other parts if i ever find any again...
---
The Lincoln's repeater from fo3 as well
---
No, it feels perfectly right. I mean, one box drops from the sky. One box gets looted, one box is empty. It's a way of giving players another choice of how they want to behave. It's a good thing!
---
If you want a lower level to have it, just let him have it. Or, warn him off, check to see if you want it, then act appropriately. We all know they're fairly often not worth the run to them. Then again, sometimes they are!
---
I'm not a fan of Fortnite, which is why I'm not subscribed to nor visit Fortnite related forums
---
Put a... Put a scorch killer or prime receiver on it...
---
Bethesda if you push this broken patch out on Tuesday for console players, I’m breaking up with you
---
What a better way to give a middle finger to those who didnt dupe.
---
 Do not disregard. You get legendary combat armor, then upgrade to BoS.
---
Tin foil hat and clean space suit 
---
That's exactly what he's referencing, did your mentats wear off?
---
Same happened to me at whitesprings 20 mins ago, I had to quit the game and lost my baggie. 
---
I would also like to build these trailers we see everywhere
---
I was able to get a plan for the gun and someone sold me a Instigating explosive version so I’m set now.
---
Thanks for the reply though!
---
I like to help new players out ... but what they don't know doesn't hurt em, and what they don't know is that while I am clearing the way for them I am taking anything with screws. Sorry toots.
---
Happened to me this morning, a dozen times, lost getting loot from a scorch queen every time and used up all my nuke keycards starting the event.
---
Thank you kind redditor, I understand. How many items are there glitches for? Is it really that big of an oversight?
---
Didn't do the excavator quest yet, will do for completion but will probably not use the PA itself.
---
Another question: I heard the x01is the best you can have. Will i be able to craft it later by questing, or is it bound to lucky drops for the plans? Asking because i bought a lvl 50 x01 chest with jet pack mod from a vendor. Bought it for the attached mod and to have the hunt for a jetpack off my chest, unsure if i should buy other x01 body parts if i ever find any again...
---
There isn’t much to say about this item in particular. There isn’t anything great or anything awful about it. While hats vary between 250 Atoms to 700 Atoms, I personally wouldn’t pay 400 for this. I do believe Bethesda is trying to find a sweet spot for Atomic Store pricing but this isn’t quite it yet. Considering that there isn’t anything special about this hat, and that it’s just a retexture, I’d personally value this at 200. 
---
It's the kind of mistake they'll only make once. Experience is the best teacher after all. Besides, only the most heartless among us would loot the poor guy/gal when we watch it happen right before our eyes.
---
Sure, it'll happen some, but not much; probably only once per person in that situation without reading reddit ahead of time. xD
---
Be careful with any messages you send on Xbox. It's not like the 360 days where you tell someone you fucked their mom. Just saying a curse word jokingly, is enough to catch a comms ban if they report that specific message. 
---
I literally just turned off my TV after finishing The Matrix in 4k and opened this subreddit to see this... am I actually plugged in?
---
Oh no.. Prepare for another video from thequartering or yongyea squealing about how they single handedly save the gaming industry by existing and how delusional redditors must be that theyre 'attacking' them.. 
---
I think in particular the CAMP allowance is currently very pathetic. It's such a limitation on player freedom, but we still see so many players who have exploited do so freely.
---
Vertibird transport could be very interesting. Drone delivery/retrieval of items could be extremely interesting and allow players the enjoyment of raiding unknown payloads.
---
One of my best experiences in the game was when a supply drop came into an inner city area (Charleston) and I saw 3-4 players engage with the drone itself. I was low level at the time and I thought they were actually competing for additional resources. As I eventually learned, they were simply hoping to kill the drone for a modest amount of XP.
---
You can look at the supply drop situation and see that the game shied away from actual competitive encounters. I was never expecting a level 200 player being able to one-shot the resource drop of a level 10 player, but it would be a greatly rewarding and engaging mechanic.
---
I saw you tuber who did this quest trying to farm the handmade plans. He said the event would never trigger from a quarter past the hour to a quarter till. So for example the quest won’t trigger from 12:15-12:45. Only before or after. I haven’t tried this myself. Only passing info. 
---
Have you found and learned the plans..?
---
Yesss I run “All Night Long” perk most of the time  just to offset the extremity of Speed Demon hunger/thirst. 
---
downvoted for obvious karma whoring. i see the same shit every other hour about the same shit everyday its getting real fucking old real fuckin fast. bethesda knows, your just going to have to wait for a patch because bitching isnt going to speed it up lmao.
---
I bow to the master 
---
Shannon turned away orphan boys 
---
and turned a  bunch of kids into killers 
---
not to say the raiders  did  not need killing ,but what about those like brody who were forced by circumstance 
---
Shannon was a misandric bitch and Olivia was a sociopathic one  
---
If you die in a game, that game is trash? 
---
Hmmm you seem like one of those Dupers.
---
Oh FUCK. Thanks mate!
---
Redneck heaven
---
Not a fan of alliteration are ya
---
No. The point of supply drops is for the person who requested the drop to get the supplies - not "everyone".
---
I like to think it’s because of the prewar food they ate up until the war. Supposedly the high sugar and preservatives laden diets modern first worlders eat cause their bodies to take longer to decay. I imagine that’s turned up to 11 in the Fallout universe. I mean, if canned goods and TV dinners are still good 25, or even a couple hundred, years later then they must be like 90% preservatives!
---
This one's Bailey's, but a bit bigger
---
Why are you still commenting on it?
---
To bad all the legendarys are worth like 10 caps 
---
Big thanks King!    I'll take a look at dodgy and ricochet!
---
Lol where was that
---
Fallout 3 and those random makeshift bunkers with the radio SOS signals.  Small rooms but always got that feeling of "what happened here?"  That is probably why I love fo76 the way I do.  The entire thing is pretty much one of those bunkers on a big scale.
---
Agreed.
---
Pull them all out and place until you find the one you need, then put all the others back in your stash. You have to be a bit quick about it, or they start auto loading into your inventory.
---
I can't stay on the same server for 15 to 20 min due to disconnects and game crashes...
---
We can hide, there's a fallout shelter nearby!
---
I wouldn't pay even 100 for ANY hat.  They're such an insignificant part of the wardrobe.  How many people have said to themselves after seeing another player in a baseball cap "by god that is one incredible fucking hat!"?
---
I remember in regards to the issues with perk sharing and also when sending Team Invites. I didn’t know it broke Barbarian and Evade, though.
---
Just a friendly reminder - don't forget to drink and rehydrated when you're busy building your CAMP!
---
Can you craft any of those for lower level?
---
Duping isn't the main problem here, it's selling duped items for real life currency.
---
Power user isn’t needed , iv never had it and jet pack around all the time and always have plenty of cores 
---
Come to that, the radiation probably didn’t do decomposition bacteria any favors either. Probably lucky they just died way down, instead of turning into FEV Super Mutant Scorched Ebola. 
---
Armor is different tho, I'm looking for clothes that go over the armor, like outfits
---
No luck. Quest items are no longer in inventory, also cant get the materials to recraft the items. All the quest is asking me to do is craft upgraded motors
---
The PvP Legendary effects suggest that there should be a PvP aspect in the game. They are working on PvP mode to be implemented soon. Then there's no chance that anyone can survive an exploding shotgun, cuz it deals 5 times more dmg than other exploding light guns. If they dont nerf them, u can oneshot anyone with a shotgun from 72 ft range. It'll be a joke. 
---
What platform?
---
The patchnotes you quoted mention nothing about being able to steal player items. More like they added a confirmation screen to the trade in order to prevent user error. Which is what the trade stealing was in the first place, user error. There is no actual proof of that exploit existing.
---
So how do you open the panel to the stairs to the underground area? 
---
Ok what do you think about this?
---

---
My favorite quest line by far
---
Figured it wouldn't hurt to try. At the very least, I'm hoping that someone on the team sees that this mod exists.
---
Honestly at this point, I'd hope that Nexus mods is a place where they check on Quality of Life mods for potential updates, especially for sorting and in-game chat.
---
Different level caps ?
---
If the cap of the weapon is 45 you won't be able to craft level 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 of this weapon.
---
Not sure. You can try searching around with the term 'fallout 76 resource map'
---
With sharing perks just make sure you have one more charisma than required and you won't have an issue. And not sure about team invites, I don't really have an issue with that. It's really annoying how it breaks those two perks though. Evade I can't ever get to work, to the point where I don't even try. Barbarian I still keep equipped because it seems to work half the time.
---
Doesn't matter which platform, I'm just curious as to your thoughts on the game
---
people are literally just giving bethesda the get out of jail free card for their shitty servers by blaming it on dupers, its pathetic really.
---
Camper build, cheap but instantly forfeits its' players claim to surrounding territory, allowing multiple player camps to stack in a trailer park. It will be abused, but it will be fun.
---
Stack diluted Rad-X with BioCommMesh. RadShield suppresses mutations.
---
Alternatively drink another Healing Factor serum to remove the chem penalty.
---
Oi mate if your on PS4 I can make you a prime receiver 
---
Not unless I have anti armour legendary effect along with explosive legendary effect
---
nice, all I’ve got left is the stuff that I did during B.E.T.A and didn’t get credit for :(
---
 "There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive."
---
Yep, this was incredibly frustrating until I finally was able to craft combat armor (questline reward?  can't remember) and said "oh, so that's how...".
---
I read this as "when someone spams you ignore them".
---

---
What power armor paint is that?
---
Drone delivery would be a great in-game mail mechanic.  I’d love to send items to a friend or just back to my base after a successful farm.  I know they have stash boxes everywhere but I can’t help but want a little air power to go with my artillery.
---
I thank thee. However, I twice reused a word (from) and even used "of", a 'non-f-beginning' word! We all have improvements to make, friend!
---
Metal armor seems to give you the most ballistic damage resistance, and with mutations you can balance both ballistic and energy resistance. 
---
Common sense tells me not to.  Don't need no damned ToS to teach me common sense....
---
Honestly, yeah you're right.  I tried justifying 200 Atoms for this item because it's "Limited", but there's absolutely no reason for any of the ball caps to be at the price they're set in.  **Especially the 700 Atom cap.**
---
Its one thing if it's a unique, brand new model.. but definitely not for these caps. 
---
It seems like what's actually happening is instead of -2 it's doing -.666 which doesn't seem to show on stats. But my carry weight while solo shows that it rounds up to the nearest xx5 or xx0, but I can't fast travel unless I'm 3 below the weight shown. Stat's just won't show a fraction. 
---
Why? Only you can access your stash and you can't scrap anything in your stash except mods when building or repairing, they can get scrapped if the mats are needed.
---
Yeah, I'd watch out doing that shit, its 2018, and people have had accounts band for homophobic stuff. 
---
Here's a non-Vat 2 handed Melee build, that allows you use Power Armour for Nuke Zones for the rad resist
---
15 Strength, run 3 blocker, 3 slugger, 3 expert slugger, 3 martial arts, 3 incision
---
3 Perception, run 3 Glowsight, other times run 1 green thumb and 2 of your choice. You want green thumb to farm nuke fluxes easily for easy caps
---
5 Endurance, run Ironclad 5... during nuke zones for power armor run Sun Kissed (reduce rad damage) and assorted others of your choice.
---
4 Charisma, run Lonewanderer 4. If you're in a group, run Rad Sponge, Inspiration and assorted others of your choice. SHARE the rad-sponge.
---
5 Intelligence, I run Makeshift weapon 5... weapons hardly break. Can keep it at this during Power Armour, or swap it out for longer cores perk etc etc. Remember to swap it out for repair specific perks when you're repairing.
---
15 Agility, Max out action boy/girl, Marathoner, White Knight, The perk that auto uses a stim pack at low health rank 1, Sneak to lose enemies perk,
---
9 Luck, Blood Mess 2, Starched Genes 2, Class Freak 3
---
Mutations required:
---
Speed demon, Marsupial, Twisted Muscles, Grounded, Carnivore (optional), Healing Factor
---
Benefits of this build and playstyle:
---
\- Insane melee damage (can easily solo silos and level 65+ Scorchbeasts with a few power attacks)
---
\- Insane health regeneration due to Healing factor
---
\- Can easily reach 300-400+ resist rating at end game without power armor. Blocker 3 and Ironclad 5 makes you a walking tank.
---
\- Huge reservoir of AP for sprinting and power attacking (remember to use Marathoner!)
---
\- Can easily switch to power armour with a few perk card swaps for Nuke Zones or if you think you're in trouble (X01 recommended for rad resist Nuke zones)
---
\- Easy caps nuke zone farmer (farm fluxes) with Green Thumb perk, each flux sells at 10 caps each.
---
\- Can easily regenerate health by running away, then sneaking to lose enemies, which then kick in Healing Factor
---
Cons of the build:
---
\- Melee build. Gun damage is terrible. Sometimes those Scorchbeats like to stay in the air. Shooting down Vertibirds require a gun too.
---
\- Not a meta TSE (two shot explosive) build
---
Try to find yourself an instigating weapon where it does double damage on anything with full health. You literally one shot them.
---
Might want to try to find yourself a +40% power attack and +30% scorched damage weapon to really rip into Scorchbeast Queens.
---
Polymer Combat armor weighs very little 
---
In the 100 levels I've been using this gun, I've never once thought about putting a Scorched Killer mod onto it. I was waiting on the prime and literally forgot the other exists. Thank you, kind redditor! 
---
Springs, yes.  Gears, I never keep more than 125.  Bulk and sell the excess.  They're easiest to get compared to springs and screws.
---
Sorry for being a bit of a jerk. If you put Dense mod oon your chest armor it will not only make scorchbeasts attacks do pretty much zero damage, but with the new Fireproof it will stop your injuring yourself with your own explosive weapon, and also protect you from other players explosive weapons.
---
There are explosive melee? Even if there were, Fireproof helps against that. :^
---
And like I said, anti armor effects won't do much. All these effects work on the principal of damage reduction not boosting my own defense. Doesn't matter if you're cutting through all my armor if your attack is only hitting at 20% strength. 
---
big oof
---
I heard there is one or two other methods, they are not widely known tho.
---
I think it looks really good. One other thing that I’ve found helpful is to remember that there is no cookie cutter build that’s perfect for everyone. I find myself moving perks and points around constantly trying to find all the little things that feel good to me and that’s really helped me enjoy the game more instead of trying to change my playstyle to match the “best” or “optimal” builds out there. I think you have a great starting point that will allow your build to flow and change as your character progresses.
---
Yeah, bought a decon shower for 800c not realizing I learned it and just haven’t built one yet. My bad for not looking. No worries, sold it for 1000c.
---
Someone wasn't playing WoW in January 2005.
---
Clothing. Weighs only 0.1 so always pick it up. Straight jackets from the Asylum and Civil War clothes from the cemetary sell for over 100 caps each.
---
*Real life currency*
---
It's called money. You mentally challenged mongoloid.
---
Idk, distributing exploited items is kinda an issue.
---
I thought the lady's space suit was worth it.  That's a freaking work of art imo, but the rest, meh, clothing sets are really all I've spent my atoms on except for flooring for my C.A.M.P.
---
Yah my title was supposed to say Finely Furnished but autocorrect turned it into finished cuz I can’t type apparently 
---
I totally agree, I hope they do some sort of PvP rework because it IS confusing as to what initiates mutual pvp, what makes you wanted, and how there’s almost no doing it in game because everyone is incentivized to be in pacifist since you can get 1 shotted in retaliation for accidental slap damage. The person who initiates pvp is at an unbelievable disadvantage (seriously could you imagine if scorched couldn’t really hurt you unless you shot them back? You’d walk through the entire game with the machete you find outside the vault) I thought fallout was supposed to be a raider, mad max style setting with danger at every corner but instead I find a “second shot wins” meta and people who are scared to lose maybe 100 caps and some junk”
---
Gears are mainly for repairing and modding weapons and building turrets. They're the kind of item you would use a lot of at once and very little over time, so keep maybe 100-200 of them unless you are building workshops often and need to build a lot of turrets.
---
This is mmo, just farm, become stronger and stronger
---
Sales approved by the subreddit moderators? For real cash? Is this fucking true? Fuck that.
---
It's ok. It's one of those things that if you don't understand its just a joke then idc if people get mad. Btw its 2019 lol so it's more dangerous now.
---
Good.
---
This makes absolutely no sense. If everyone disconnected, how would anyone get the duped goods back off that world?
---
I actually have both the normal and auto prime receivers but don't use them since i don't like crafting Ultracite ammo.
---
\^ This. No need to apologise, Always be proud of the fact you can write/read and even speak in multiple languages. 
---
I'll join. And see if I can get loot this time
---
I get the extra 100 carry weight for free when i log into a server, for like 5-10 minutes. Found some calibrated shocks for the t-60 and haven't looked back. The extra resist stats are worth it imo.
---
Ok that's fucking awesome and very creative. Love it.
---
Yes. Which mod gives 10%? 15%? 20%? Or am I misunderstanding? 
---
SCREW THAT, I WANNA LIVE! 
---
Is this for real? Seriously? Wtf Bethesda.. 
---
The nailer (semi random reward from one violent night) is what ive been using, a unique bloody cultist dagger
---
Quit crying about guns and play your own game,
---
Did that yesterday, we had nearly the whole server participating. Almost everyone was over 50 too. Somehow we ran out of time and SBQ left before we got her past 50% (after the regen).
---
I liked that spot it was pretty good but she didn't land as much as she did the other times I fought her in the nuke zone.
---
Lol, I noticed that and didn't know the reason.
---
PS4?
---
I skipped dodgy because it used too much AP when getting hit, which meant I couldn't sprint out or power attack back.
---
If you want to risk getting banned, sure, go ahead and exploit away.
---
Lol good one. 
---
Look, the discussion was about PvP. About why would they have a very specific perk card allowing enhanced damage to player created buildings and such if they didn't want that. Players complaining about griefing "it's PvP, not griefing cause that's how the hanger is designed"
---
 I was bringing in the other side of that exact same discussion. Asking why they would/did add a pacifist mode at the same time telling players you could opt out of PvP entirely. You could block players or just jump servers. 
---
I don't know their original intentions for any of this, but they essentially created a system that allows intentional griefing. The design works for workshops for the most part though. Where PvP should be expected. For camps though it's a mess. Doesn't seem really thought out and it's like they didn't know what we'd do to each other given the chance. 
---
I inserted the tap, then booked it and hid two levels down in a closet and let the scorch beast deal. Worked like a charm!
---
Shit, they are on to us. Send in the smiths.
---
You’ll be able to craft the x-01 armor after you finish the Enclave quest. You’ll build “prototype” armor but that’s just a color setting. Paint it standard for a steel look or use a pattern from the atom shop (I use the tricentennial pattern myself)
---
I’ve found a toilet in a house in the forest with a rad roach wearing a top hat &amp; wedding ring sitting upon it
---
The exact wording doesn't matter here.
---
Also why the insults ?
---
I haven't said anything that might have offended you.
---
Yong is desperate for those hate hype dollar do's. Anything that helps him from having to get that 9 to 5 retail job.

Sorry my 3 star gauss rifle

---
I am slowly building my Assassins set. I even found an Assassins revolutionary sword with 40% swing rate yesterday. The rest of my build is a bit rooted but. 
---
Only thing I can think of would be to do a worldwide buff.  Like for example let’s say that the option is to defend Wade Airport.  So let’s say it’s a horde event with the need to defend objects while they are repaired, akin to the last part of the nuke preps with the chiefs.  So you defend the objectives, and for the next 2 hours everyone enjoys free Vertibird air support.  Or defend the mutations factory and everyone gets increased ammo drops from mobs.  Or mama dulces and everyone gets to enjoy less hunger loss.  Then after the two hours the event becomes available again.  If it is lost it’s two hours no buff, so the punishment is there.  Just a thought anyways.
---
At like 3:56, you get killed by a random and lose 500 caps...
---
Any armor with the effects on it I want, generally speaking anyway.
---
Ap regen, weightless, sneak bonus .. maybe chem reduction 20%. I couldn't care less about the type. It's all about the effects for me.
---
Really!?!  Take the opportunity to move your camp for free.  
---
I'm confident I can still take it. Although crit headshots are always going to be a problem.
---
What the fuck is this
---
You’re missing what I’m saying. I’ve never moved my camp object and I don’t always come in the same plaice when I fast travel home. 
---
Yes but at lvl 35, I haven’t found any t60 I can utilize. I do have a full set of t51, but I need to repair it. I have a few pieces of t60, but not a full set, and it’s at lvl 45 I believe.
---
I've got mixed feelings about the Nuka-Girl Rocket Suit.. its definitely one of the best looking clothing items you could buy at the moment. The only thing I don't like about it is that its not new.  It's a reused asset from Fallout 4s DLC. It just makes me wonder how much of Fallout 4s assets are going to be repackaged and resold.
---
Also, my first Atomic store purchase was C.A.M.P. flooring haha.  Love the clean hardwood floors. 
---
Aight for sure
---
Reference to a YT series called Monster Factory by Polygon!
---
Fyi, there is *pocketed(+5)* and **deep pockets(+10)**
---
If you don’t have deep on legs, start scrapping, lol
---
Yeah drop rates in this game are trash.  I happily buy what I want.
---
Cool, didn’t know that 
---
This is great
---
I typically run Ultra-light marine legs and heavy BoS Combat armor chest and arms. I feel like it gives me plenty of protection and it looks cool af 
---
For energy weapons I believe you need a seperate card (one of the science cards I think) other weapons just have specific caps. Lever action, gauss rifle and I think hand made cap at 45? 
---
honestly sounds more like someone is just harassing you - I help low levels in my camp by refitting their items and handing out heavy leather chest armors and things like that a few hours a week and never have run into people stalking me for this 
---
and I've seen (and harassed) dupers its pretty easy to see them as they keep repeating the same actions over and over so my best guess is the people who did this were jack asses using this as a reason to harass people not cause they thought you were duping as I've seen people run up to me and start screaming "you dupe bro??!" which made me face plant into my keyboard at the stupidity of the situation
---
What's most tragic (and it only occurred to me just now) is that the husband and father Fredrick could have stepped in when Shannon was asking for help and could have diffused the situation for both parties.
---
What seemed like a noble act of tough love was probably the way to save the situation.
---
How'd you do this without getting the "intercepts with existing object" all the time?
---
Good work Brownyparty, good work indeed. 
---
instigating would have some strong situational uses, but furious is useful almost always, imo.
---
what they really need is a poll of around 100 things people would like in the game so we could rank it so they can see what people want 
---
Could not agree more
---
they actually said that was one moderators version of a joke and already posted before Christmas it wasn't a real thing
---
I could agree with that, actually 
---
It was easily my favorite questline in FO76.
---
Of course, that's scant praise, because it was the *only* questline in FO76 other than the main one. But it was still damn good. 
---
I feel the Assassin effect tends to works better on armor since you're able to stack the effect up to 5 times with armor pieces.
---
That said, I do have a few Assassin Weapons I really need to try out.
---
And pretty sweet, Swing speed is always nice.
---
Thanks for responding... 
---
Whoa!
---
*Blank stare*
---
would be nice if there was a approved by bethesda location for mods that allow customization but not cheating 
---
Point 6: I am Canadian and having the same problem, the few friends I have made so far are always on full servers in north america and I end up on a server where I can't understand or communicate with anyone. I have even ended up on European servers and I'm in western Canada. I had a ping of over 2000ms to one server yesterday. 
---
Point 8: Very valid, I believe there is a push on to make that happen with the added caveat that it should have a chance to give us access to one of the legendary effects to apply to a similar weapon. I think this would work if it became an item that couldn't be traded, sold or given away like atom shop items.
---
Point 9: most definitely, I agree that it is a hassle to pay caps to travel but I think a 50% reduction would be more then enough. With the Travel Agent perk it's about 40ish caps to go corner to corner on the map, and after around level 60 I have had a constant  cap amount over 3k up to 14k I'm at now at lvl 120.
---
Got a set of heavy combat armor. BoS mod makes it probably the best defensive armor, but I'm still missing the plans for BoS chest and arms. Dense chest mod for explosion protection, deep pockets on the rest.
---
My pieces are all legendaries, but mostly crap bonuses. Think I've got one weightless, a couple life savers, don't recall what else. 
---
For imminent attacks sure.
---
Totally **really real** and can be yours for 400 Atoms, but only if you snatch it within the next 21 hours ;)
---
Was honestly hoping for a comment like this though, was wondering if many people checked the Atomic Store tab often. 
---
That’s completely fair. My buddy doesn’t like it either for that same reason. My build is focused heavily on survivability, and having no-power armor, I try to squeeze out every last bit of protection that I reasonably can. I also don’t Power Attack much since it’s so slow with 2H but that’s just my playstyle. 
---
All-rounded not bad, but mediocre for specialized builds.
---
known bug
---
Same
---
Jeez if our definition of pvp is so loose that you're going to correct down to the very 's' at the end of the words I dont think I want to debate it with you
---
Is all the criticism justified? Absolutley not. I've played over 200 hours and still having a blast.
---
But it's not like BGS gave us a $60 value. So they kind of invited this criticism initially. Then they keep compounding the perception with nearly monthly gaffes.
---
So let's stop defending BGS and just stick to game talk, ok?
---
noticed this myself, none of my limb armor with rad resist applies the buff, the chest does at least.
---
200 here
---
Camp at white springs was making .e mad so I kept shooting the turrets. It was kinda fun. Oh I left some supplies for them to rebuild and a few useless legendaries. 
---
After that a level 10 tried to claim the rewsrd5 with a shovel got a good laugh.
---
It’s even worse now, the new method DC’s the whole server. And it’s faster not waiting, so the really messed it up. 
---
I used to have my resolution set lower than it is now.  When I increased my resolution, it made all of the photos I took look pixelated on the loading screens.  The photos are just screenshots that do not change after they've been taken.
---
You can upgrade them. They are epic..
---
Awesome concept! PM'd you some ideas :-)
---
Post videos of server crashing exploits on their TWITTER feed. That will get their attention. 
---
Thanks. I actually found something just now that straight-up just says, "[Alt-Shift]" on it.
---
Wait I'm confused you only carry 245 w all this pockets? I don't have and pocketed armor and I get the same carry weight 
---
Same here.. just cant do it.
---
Me having a rifle that happens to work extremely well with my mostly pistol build.
---
If you have blocker 3 and at least 300+ resist you take trivial damage. Slap on healing factor mutation and you'll never need a stimpack after a fight.
---
Yeah I experienced one of these today to my benefit somewhat since I scrapped something I regretted and bam I was d/ced and came back on and time went back a few mins or something because all my stuff was still there. Too bad I lost a mod I learned from scrapping the moment it crashed.
---
Only if your name is Kevin. 
---
its mostly cause duping needs 2 people so if you see 2 players sitting at a camp for a long time it seems suspicious I know I've went to investigate a few times I saw people standing at the same spot for long times (mostly cause of curiosity) and around 5% of those times it was dupers the other time it was pretty funny stories 
---
that said most people look around for groups of non moving people if the server starts acting funny like - server not responding - message pop ups out of no where means someone is dropping mega stacks of items 
---
Or forget nuke zones and just farm the ghouls.  They often drop chems which sell well, too.  Plus other crap and exp.
---
Have you tried carrying 1k-1.5k lbs of weight and going through your inventory? Similar to watching paint dry.
---
Your strength is higher and you have marsupial.
---
Golf shirts/skirts are the same.
---
God I love fucking with you apologist retards. Cuckthesda screws you over again and again and you all can't wait to jump on their clock. Wallets out and white knight theM any chance you get. This forum is truly amazing. No wonder they pull this shit. You all eat it up. 
---
If only people put this kind of passion into real life issues we may have fewer problems.
---
No need for power armour if you're running a melee build with the correct perks and grounded mutation... but it really really helps to have power armour for the rad resist otherwise you burn through too many RadAways.
---
You know what. Power armour is required for silos... too much trouble without it.
---
I’m ran out of popcorn 
---
Lost a good bit of stable crimson and florescent flux tonight because of tse in a white springs nuke. My own fault because i got greedy with it. But I'll be damned if it doesn't suck to have your shit pilfered through.
---
Man I came across this scene by accident and knew it was the damned finale - total accidental spoiler. Made me kinda bummed. Why don’t the bodies spawn there at that actual part of the quest?? I built a camp and went to find a way down from the mountain and then BOOM. The main protagonists of the Mistress of Mystery are laying there dead. 
---
Sure, there’s story there that I’m missing, but it was a crucial aspect of that journey that I spoiled for myself. 
---
But now... as I say this... maybe that’s part of the magic? Not everything plays out in order all the time. 
---
I overthink shit. Too many beers. 
---
My deathclaw unfortunately attacks everyone he sees, so I had to move my camp to a very remote location
---
That's lame. I liked summoning those caches for newer players. It's exciting for them to see free loot fall from the sky =(
---
The firebreathers quest is really good especially in belching betty.
---
Drop yet?
---
Strength builds are meta.
---
Either 2H Melee or Shotgun build (especially TSE shotgun).
---
We commented almost the same thing at the same time 
---
Honestly I am not sure this is something they are easily able to stop. Duping been a thing in other survival games like 7 Days to Die and it's been patched and always come back. These games a very similar. There has to be a reason we see this in both games like this.
---
yes. i have it and i saw mod for auto converson in watoga multiple times. and there is a grenade laucher like barrel too. btw the regular semi auto is the best. the shotgun barrel seems to me weak, the charging barrel cause game crash every time if u shoot any mob and the auto barell just wasting the amo. with stacked adrenaline perk u can oneshot 8-10 ghouls in whitespring with a regular  non legendary tesla .
---
Bye lol
---
I can assume from this response that you’re a duper. 
---
Not at all. Want screen shots of my inventory/stash?
---
I just search then continue on.. if I hear the cue then I retrace my steps. 
---
I like grinding for better gear and just exploring. The long complex missions and side missions are the best part though. I like the quick "event" missions too because you get to play with other people in a relaxing way. Also camp building, really like scouting the perfect camp spot and then building a palace on it.
---
Biggest dislike is probably PvP. I just don't care about contesting other players to see who has better gear or guns. Rather just have pacifist mode turn off PvP damage entirely, both ways. Maybe even have PvP/non-PvP servers so both types are catered to.
---
Sorry that happened.  Why would they think you'd have a lot of loot if you're a duper?  It's only junk that drops?
---
I am having the same problem with some stairs. You find a fix?
---
Ah thank you! I usually take all the suits I find each day and leave them out at the base until they are taken or when I get offline I teleport to a random player and drop it for them so their is no disconnection uncertainty. Earlier someone took the full T-60 I had so the picture only had the spare parts left over.
---
Eheh. Methinks those "predictive programs" could do with some +Perception and accuracy perks. \^.\^
---
I made sure I got at least some damage on them. Idk why it wasn’t dropping. But there was no one there running and tse and they were being great about not stealing kills like that. 
---
Plans you posses already need to be dropped and relooted, same with found plans (pickup, drop, pickup again)
---
Harpers ferry the damn by the trains and broken main road bridge I love it perfect only 2 ways enemies can come from (A.I.)
---
The fact you have the items and haven't been banned means that they're not basing the bans off having the items, but rather off some other data that tells them people were actually there, which is very likely available to them as they have all back-end data.
---
I know it isn’t much of a problem but it’s more of a quality of life kind of addition 
---
Cool mate, just add me and if I am online feel free to pop in! If you need anything just let me know.
---
I ran into the same thing, it may be that some of those mats, likely the lead, is still in an object you haven't scrapped but it still shows as available. At least that was my problem making ammo, it won't scrap items to complete a recipe, you have to manually scrap them.
---
 OP is asking that the game automatically do this. I vote no unless it's an iron you can toggle on (off by default). If I join my buddy and my spot is taken I can live with it. I can just use his camp. 
---
That’s exactly the spot that I’ve been trying to build something similar.  Wish I could visit yours without packing mine up.  Looks great!
---
Oh nvm fully read lol can't think of any locals like that but beneath the bride there might work largw hole in it too could be the enterance
---
I love you man
---
I don't think it's a problem at all.
---
Anyhow, with .ini files it's easy for Bethesda to remedy if it was ever considered cheating. They could just turn off that function server side so that that ini entry essentially does nothing.
---
I wouldn't worry about it unless it's an obvious hack/exploit.
---
You know, I’ve been thinking about taking marathoner in Agility for the extra sprint so I may try it out in place of dodgy and see how that goes. 
---
Trailer Park Boys in the post-apocalypse
---
Check out watoga for t-60. Near the downed vertibird on the street in the center of city. The top of emergency services building, and the downed vertibird on the building across from it. Easily find t-60 that scales to your level.
---
Idk why no one said this before, but you should list the platform.
---
Chem effectiveness does indeed get reduced. However as of now in consoles, it will say energy weapon damage reduced by 12%, however it actually doesnt. Easy to check with radx
---
ESO requires you to accept a duel in order for you to die if solo or party adventuring. The Multiplayer faction wars on the other hand you will die because it’s a large scale “war”
---
I play on console. Can somebody further detail this issue for me for console players to understand?
---
Heads of creatures that can be hung on walls. Different stair types. Curtains. Radios. More powered items like doors and traps.
---
I have a lot of ideas for things that should be in CAMP but I also believe they should be actually... In game.
---
I'm all for the Atom Shop. Give us weird and crazy stuff. I love it.
---
But some of the more basically stuff should really be added to the base game.
---
I'm hoping Bethesda does realize this and puts more of the substantial stuff in through expansions and save the flashier decorative stuff for the Atom Shop where it belongs.
---
I dont buy this explanation and i dont trust overseer or vault tec to be representing reality of "Reclamation" as such
---
Main storyline is your priority. It takes you through the Brotherhood and Enclave factions, so you unlock the power armour to take into Nuke Zones. It also takes you through launching a nuke.
---
Once those are done, travel to every point in the map and do the side quests.
---
Going to early cities and dropping T-45 and Raider sets is fun when low level players inch towards the suits unsure if they should take it. Hearts and Thumbs Up for approval haha.
---
I have healing factor and I just don't use rad shield.  I just put rad away and radaway dilluted in my hot wheel prior to going into the nuke zone then spam it when my rads get over 25%. I do go thru a lot of radaway but you find it everywhere. I also pick as many of those flowers as I can when I'm in the mire so I can craft it. 
---
Can somebody explain to me how this obvious bait post actually got to the front page?
---
xD
---
There's a handful of items you can't get rid of if they're for a quest but one of the most resource intensive quest items in the game is susceptible to a mistake. On one hand you can say "be more careful" but we aren't always able to see everything and sometimes the game could lag one directional input and you end up losing something valuable. If you need the excavator armor to complete the quest it shouldn't bee scrappable till it's registered
---
HOLY SHIT!! Seriously, WTF!? 
---
Well, I'm pretty excited for the video man. Can't wait to see how far you have gone along with your build. Damn, I really didn't think the initial finding would end up turning into this much of a power house. Pretty crazy how far this has come. I'm really glad you were able to find this and bring it to the next level. Kudos man!
---
God damn that is a badass gun
---
Fair!
---
Fund a junk node and place your C.A.M.P near it. It'll give you the option to build one under resources. 
---
Btw, you can still mine directly from resource nodes while an extractor is present. For ores use the excavator power armor to get bonus quantity. 
---
I have failed
---
Here's how to kill a duper. I did. Ready? 
---
Watch. Wait. Listen. 
---
Just bc 2 or 3 ppl are together on a map (one really high lvl), doesn't mean they are duping. 
---
The ONLY reason I killed dupers was they set up shop near my camp. I could hear them on my chat. I saw how slow they walked. I followed them. I watched them. They were, in fact, duping.
---
When the high lvl left the sever, I killed the 2 goons, took their stiff, which indeed was a crapton of dup's, and I scrapped it, then dropped the scrap in the river... After I dropped an orbital strike beacon on the camp as high lvl spawned back in. 
---
This isn't a self righteous, obnoxious post. This took me about an hour of listening and watching... Visually verifying the facts. 
---
DON'T JUST ASSUME BC PPL ARE TOGETHER ON A MULTIPLAYER GAME THAT THEY ARE DUPERS. 
---
Wth how you build a base under that road?
---
got 10 once for looting at an owned workshop very early game did not know what i was doing, the other fighting a scorchbeast shot it with a minigun but some fool had set up camp near whitesprings golf course got capped by some level 160 dude who took all my junk
---
 
---
They absolutely DO have a problem with it: the continued inab6to do it themselves. 
---
It's such an obvious QoL change. 
---
You put 200 hours into a 60 dollar game that's more time then most 60 dollar games give you now a days and those games are still 60 dollars and come with bugs
---
Ever play any of the last 3 fallout games? It's a fallout game, for better and worse. Some stuff is annoying, frustrating sometimes even. But I'm having a ton of fun and the world is a really cool place to explore.
---
If you have Nvidia check your Geforce Experience settings... Mine changed with the last update to do 4k super sampling. It works fine for everything... except when I'm inside bunkers/building maps for some reason, and my FPS drops hard. I re-optimized it since it has a new value suggested and it worked out so much better.  
---
its a 0 pick that is always picked at the default position lol
---
Like what 
---
I'll possibly buy it. Can you send picture of it for stats?
---
I’ll let you fast travel to me
---
I was one of the people begging for an offline mode when this game was announced, but I've revised my opinion. I actually get a lot of enjoyment  from teaming up with randoms, or enjoying someone else's nuke. Even just seeing others on the map. I think the game would actually be lesser for a private mode. 
---
The only thing to tempt me would be mods, but there's nothing that *immediately* jumps out at me that I'd have to have. 
---
I loaded up a game today. Went to the scrapyard, took over, and started building it up. Server disconnected after only being on it for around 30 minutes so I said screw this and went to Astroneer. I've said it before, I think the community REALLY wanted a co-op Fallout game. Not this glitchy, broken, multiplayer crap they gave us.
---
Yes! Great to see another Mister-ess Of Mystery in the wild!
---
Android 13 that you?
---
Lmao its all the calmex an day tripper
---
Anyone able to loot her?  She disappeared for me as soon as we killed her. 
---
To be fair, the duping methods rely on fucking up the servers.  I mean, that is literally how they work, you force disconnects before the server has an opportunity to update its information.  Granted, if the servers were 'less shitty', it would be more difficult to exploit this, but the duping attempts are absolutely causing instability because WITHOUT causing that instability, duping would not be possible.
---
Sounds like a major bug to me.
---
The higher level versions of those weapons should have automatically unlocked as soon as you reached those levels.
---
Wow this game tonight. The scorchbeast queen is showing up with loot from a normal scorchbeast like wtf 
---
The real griefers have always been the anti-duping squad. No surprise here. 
---
Aight my negro
---
Inb4 OP is on console
---
Nope. OP is a ban evader
---
You're at 170? I'm not even 55 yet and I've been playing since Black Friday.
---
How could it not cause server instability, people were literally 1000s of toms overweight and the game isn’t meant to render that
---
He doesn't report on it untill kotaku or some other news source and uses they as his source so you have to use their sources to figure anything out 
---
Happened to me also, it ruined a damn good quest for me.
---
This is a large part of why I went with console version first till they work out all the issues. PC is definitely more likely to have the hardcore types out to find every exploit the second after patch goes live
---
THIS happened to me with a heavy combat armor mod...fucking infuriated 
---
It's not intentional griefing, it's intentional PvP.
---
1,600
---
 The loot doesn't really improve for turning in more than one at a time though. It's all random. You get 1, turn it in asap before getting another. Get more rewards that way. I wish it just let you turn in one at a time instead of taking the entire stack. 
---
Long as you're not on a pov machine (console), there is a mod to fix it. 
---
It's kind of shitty we have to do this, but at least users can fix it on pc. You know, doing more of Beth's work. 
---
Pure RNG, server hopping works only sometimes because you’ll end up joining the same multiple servers. Just play the game, check the vendor each play through, that’s how I got one calibrated shocks and a jet pack, praying for another one
---
There was an infinite xp glitch involving a certain grenade bouquet and disarming it infinitely. 
---
I'm getting sick of losing ammo whenever I pick up ingredients from the world, watched 25 rounds of ultracite ammo leave my inventory when I harvested a blast berry plant in a nuke zone, it seems that whatever weapon you have equipped gets hit when harvesting. I have also had ammo removed when completing the Forbidden Knowledge quest. You might want to watch for these 2 happening as well, only have melee on when harvesting plants, the quest one I can't seem to avoid at all.
---
I’d really hoped they would just bring cateye back
---
Well, that's fucking stupid. 
---
What about plans already -used- ?
---
Some people have lots of time apparently...
---
I’m level 33 and bought the game the day before launch. 
---
I've played maybe 3 weeks and 2 of that was very on off and I'm nearly 100 hinestly wish it didn't keep increasing beyod 50 seeing the larger numbers bothers me mostly cause its pointless to be they could still give perk cards.
---
So you saw some people, decided “they must be duper’s!” With no evidence, and then decided to attack them because if it. Well done, what a big man/woman you are
---
How about Bethesda refunds everyone, tags "still in alpha" on the game, let those who own the game continue to play, but live with the plague of bugs until Bethesda releases an actual working version of the game (for free to those who own it).
---
My two shot Fatman and my ultracite Gatling laser.
---
Same here, also with a Ryzen 7 2700x.  My freezes are longer, typically 1-10 minutes if I decide to wait it out, but now I just avoid the area.  Video card is a nVidia RTX 2080Ti, and I've tried old drivers, newest driver, clean driver installs, different resolutions/presets, and reducing processor core affinity, all with no luck.
---
Yes, it is for *everyone* otherwise they wouldn't broadcast it. 
---
Thank god I won't have time for this shitty game come tomorrow. Seems they're making it worse the minute they started to make it better. 
---
When building bases like this, I assume the first thing that goes down is the camper thing. How do you drop that so that its hidden away while you build? I want to build something but I want my camper inside my structure.  How do I do that?
---
I'm on console personally, but PC friends are telling me that the DC/server crashes have spiked dramatically since the patch went live. Dreading the patch on console. =/
---
This is apocalyptic survival, if you’re not scoping out the area before investigating a free treasure chest in the middle of nowhere, then you really ought to rethink something.
---
Don't worry, it will only take Bethesda a month to incompletely fix it.
---
I'm glad you now see the idiocy of you trying to exclude the destruction of another player's structures from PvP.
---
No bethesda did all the broken/wrong things, these guys did the fixing of those broken/wrong things. Modders are the ONLY reason bethesda is still in business given how terrible the games are before modders fix the garbage.
---
Sometimes it's one person and not the other that needs to restart the game. No way to really tell though. Such BS.
---
hours and hour of minute movements to find that one pixel that will allow me to place the floor or item where i want it.
---
not gonna lie it was fun but painful.
---
They don’t add. They get calculated one after the other
---
True, i have seen a guy named GamesGlitches being level 800 or so, the guy clearly cheated, but a lot people who reached 200+ didn't.
---
"Do try not to track blood all over the carpet? *Laughs awkwardly*"
---
Server lag was literally how the duping happened... You had to cause server lag for it to work. I'm amazed people still don't think that was the cause.
---
Similar happened to me last night. My base camp is literally right next to the overseers camp in the water by the bridge. I have 4 water purifiers running for noobs and free food. 
---
Last  night a new player walks in. Asks of he can have some water yeah man here ima make you some food too.
---
I sit down start stiring the pot and i hear miniguns spool up along with explosions and it was just nuts.
---
Noob died. My house was busting down. Then i died. I walk over did the confused emote.  Dude gets on the mic starts on about dupers. 
---
I was like bro.. check my gear. Proceed to trade. The two apologised and left after a donation.. but seriously. 
---
Witch hunting. 
---
Bethesda better take note and implement this on all platforms. 
---
So I should have used concentrated fire from the jump then ? It’s crazy , I’ve never had any trouble with this game up until this point .
---
122 buddy still awhile off from you. But levels mean nothing past level 50.
---
Or just add a third flag...that'd be better. 
---
95% accurate 
---
Would still miss every time lol
---
Wow doing too much 
---
If you give it me I can solve that for you "wink wink"
---
yes please 
---
turrets cost too much 
---
Rad showers and rad away will remove mutations if you dont have starch gene on.
---
Nah, I've just read the rest of your comments and dont feel like arguing with you over this. You're very set in your mindset and I dont want to spend my time trying to change that
---
This has been a very helpful resource for me at least:

Before the release of Fo4 he did a series on the leaks (real and fake) that was kinda neat, but that's the only stuff of his I've ever seen.
---
Some super mutants have mini guns and will drop a bunch of 5mm. Just go to West Tech or Huntersville
---
I've never even seen the tattered field jacket!?
---
I have lots of time too, but it's quite boring to just farm xp with no differences.
---
It’s a random spawn in the cave. There are 3 nests or so I believe. 
---
You cant combined perks and armor to make it weightless but you can equip a full armor set of whatever weight reducing you want to make it weightless.
---
Wow fans doing the work!!
---
I will say, I enjoy it but I don't play often much other games.. 
---
Play it yourself and see if you like it or don't. Its like f4 and its also not. Its frustrating and fun. Is it worth 60? Probably not. I pre ordered for 120 and it came out a month later at 30. 
---
But to answer. I recommend you buy it. 
---
The duping processes literally rely on forced server disconnects and causing those disconnects to occur before the server and client have a chance to sync their information...Now that they have fixed the ability to dupe by simply forcing yourself to be disconnected, it makes sense that the only way to pull it off requires bringing down the entire server at once...
---
Don't get me wrong, if the servers were more stable it would not be possible to exploit them in such a way, but when that exploit specifically requires crashing the entire server to function, you can't claim that using that exploit DOESN'T cause instability...It wouldn't work otherwise.
---
I'm legit 250 idk if it's something I should be proud of
---
This may help:

---
Have you droped the nuke?
---
The way servers work, they are designed to process a certain amount of information. If the information being processed suddenly spikes by let's say, duping 100k bobble heads, the server suddenly becomes unstable and crashes. Duping and unlimited weight exploits are the exact same thing. It's causing the server to try to process a huge amount of information that it was not supposed to there to begin with. 
---
They call it the mutation check.
---
It's not a good thing for xmen builds who only want to pve.
---
Level 30 shot gun hasn’t been working . Went in there with 300 rounds and by the time I repaired that reactor I had 7 left . Obviously wasn’t working . 
---
Also what's your gtag?
---
BoS Heavy combat, all 4 limbs deep pocketed.   +marsupial, with  7 Str special, I leave camp with 280 capacity.
---
Buying the weapons is shitty. They are guaranteed duped. You are literally cheating.
---
Are you on pc? I can do it for free
---
Xbox?
---
Yep just like the famous saying about super powers goes:
---
"With great power comes great responsibility. Now, let's put that into action. I've marked this settlement on your map."
---
Metal walls.
---
Good timing. I moved camp today for just the 2nd time since the game released, and once again all of my crops vanished from my little adhesive/soup/juice farm I had going. I'll use this loop until I get the ingredients to set up my farm again. 
---
Yea I’m pc. Sorry meant to put that into post.

# Saved Structure is Suddenly Locked and Unable to be Placed???
---
1. PC
---
2. thecatsmeow
---
3. (I am very new to Reddit and don't know how to add pictures :c )
---
4.  So, I built this cute little two level schoolhouse looking shelter.   It saved to stored,  and I've been able to place it at multiple locations when moving my camp.  This past time I tried to place it,  It was locked and I cannot place it anywhere.   I've tried moving my camp multiple times with no luck.   This past time, I noticed if I switch tabs it becomes unlocked and then locks again when I start moving it around to place it.  My budget doesn't appear to be full, so I'm at a loss to what changed between before and now.  The only thing that happened in between me being allowed to place it,  and not, is that my friend built a structure at my camp (my house was not placed at that point,  and was never on the same plot as their structure) and that had also saved to stored.  That structure has since been deleted.  My only thought is that there's something in my house that's locked, but I haven't the foggiest idea how that would have happened.
---
I spent a lot of time on this house and I really don't want to have to rebuild it :c
---
5.  190113-005139
---
Tl;dr:  My saved structure is suddenly locked and I am unable to place it at any location.
---
So does trading. Or offloading stuff you found to a mule. 
---
They don't mean much, true, but i'm just imagining the situation in some future DLC where everyone will be like 300 and then there's below 200 me.
---
That's kinda lame.  I don't really need any of the loot, generally, so I just call in the supply drops near Flatwoods for the low-levels players to find/loot.  I really never call it in just for myself- once you're past level 10 or so the drops are not as useful anyway
---
It kinda hurt to scrap that one, but I've been playing FO:Frost so I'm mostly used to 'letting go'.
---
Bet 25000 caps that recent dupefest and server crashing is due to dupers attempting to cash out their dev room "Exclusive" stuffs before it gets patched.
---
But "inNoCeNT plAYerS bAnnEd fOr nOThiNg bECAuse bEAthesda BaD"

Killing Queens and seeing everyone in Power Armour.
---
I hate flying scorchbeasts.
---
Interested in two things, how many hours have you played and how many of those you just farmed xp ?
---
They are tiered. You cant see the 4th tier plans til you own the 3rd. Each does a little better than the next. The marine wet suit looks the best to me.
---
Maybe don't assume social anxiety first. Some of us are just simple introverted misanthropes.
---
While I'm an introvert myself I do like to help. Learned the hard way not to trust. Sorry, but one of the bad apples ruined it for the rest of you. 
---
Fucker fast traveled to my camp, maxed the budget, left team, then leveled the whole thing. Big bounty but I wasn't interested. Bounty hunters were though. I accepted those invites, though knowing what they were for. Joke is on that tool. He burned his own resources, then paid his own bounty to troll a throwaway test character. Still...fuck him and douchebagery.
---
This IS bethesda we are talking about, so most likely they have no checks whatsoever on the server and are too incompetent to actually code something, so they are most likely banning players manually.
---
There is a little alien space ship in the pond by lewisburg station with a fusion core in it
---
I posted not expecting such a quick response. Gimme a couple mins and I’ll send you my IGN. Thanks bud. 
---
Okay take heavy guns you put the 90% weight on then 5 pieces of 20% weapon on and boom you now have a 50 cal that weighs 0.21   
---
Now if you have a weightless armor and yu put ulta light on it, it will weigh 0  
---
Also if you have say a gun with 90% weight reduction that comes off first then the perk then the reduction from the armor but it will not be zero, at none of mine have gotten to there.   
---
I hope this helps you understand.   
---
Also for me the junk reduction nor the ammo stack with the perks. Junk will cap out at 90% (75% + the 20% goes over the 90% cap) Though for a friend when they have max pack rat and the junk perk it takes the extra 90% off the reduced 75% not sure why or what the difference is. 
---
Not really that hard to spot them. O.o
---
Im legit 277 and have over 500 hours in so far. No exploits.
---
For legendary heavy combat pieces, I have had best luck farming events, like Distant Thunks, AWOL Armaments, Cop a Squat, etc.  Few and far between, and all 1 star, but nice enough for me.
---
I have often wondered about their choice to go past level 50 for future content concerns. They could of had it at level 50 with the exp bar resetting each time it hit 51 and giving the player the level up screen.
---
When you see raiders with a somewhat gray palette and duct tape on their belt, that’s the jacket. 
---
I’d swear Empath and class freak don’t work together sometimes.  I know there’s a visual glitch supposedly only not showing the reduction but I’ve played with them on enough that there’s definitely times it’s simply not working (the reduction of negative effect by class freak).  
---
It’s annoying me to the point of considering wiping mutations one by one to get rid of it even though I’ll undoubtedly mess something up and have to serum it.
---
Still waiting to get out of beta
---
See I've actually had this happen to me once.
---
But the second time it happened it didn't activate PvP. I know the guy wasn't in Pacifist because he soon after hit me back and it did cause PvP.
---
4 leaf is per hit, psychopath is per kill - 4 leaf is way better :)
---
This is a dumb change why would it give you a bounty if it’s a quest for everyone it even encourages you to go get it.the quest literally just says “get the supply drop” 
---
Glowing ones at whitesprings gives ‘boss xp’ for every kill (400 or so)
---
Many many maaaany ghouls spawn there... meant to be like 100~xp according to patch notes
---
That’s how I smashed out a bunch of levels
---
Well, that explains everything, how many of those 500 have you farmed ?
---
I’ve never thought of using one, I may start to look into it, too late for my lvl 50 troubleshooter’s explosive combat shotgun, was my best friend for nuke silo runs :(
---
After level 100-150 it's pretty pointless because you have the perk cards and special points where you want. I feel like people of that level just grind it out for status, fun, or they have been farming for a certain item. 
---
The other thing is white springs gave out a stupid amount of exp, even after level 100 I was still gaining 2-5 levels while in it which I found to be boring. Im only 127 but I did that mostly by questing, exploring the map and completing events. 
---
To each their own in my mind
---
All I see is "reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
Weird flex, but okay
---
Technically there was also an  xp exploit where all glowing mobs in nuke zones were giving major boss xp and that is why there are guys like me at 41 and you at 55 where there are others 200+ after tomorrow’s patch (console) all those glowing ghouls people farm white springs for will have their xp back to normal levels
---
What platform you play on?
---
That's literally not how anyone who recounted the "steal through trades" called it though. I'm not sure what they fixed, but in every single instance(afaik) of people claiming they were stolen from, they said they accepted the trade.
---
Ramp that bounty up even higher!
---
Right?  It also stands to reason that now that it has been patched and causing yourself to be forcibly disconnected no longer works, the only way to get the same effect is to bring down the entire server at the same time...
---
Causing a disconnect before the client and server could sync their information is literally the mechanic that allows for duping to occur and that requires exploiting their instability.
---
Specifically here, the US Civil War. 
---
Nuke was dropped, thanks for the help everyone

&gt;2Posted byu/77fishy55 minutes agoCan't craft some higher level guns. I'm level 78 with Gunsmith level 5. Why?  
---
I don't know if this is a bug or some level requirement. I equip the Perk for Gunsmith level 5, and I'm level 78.I can't craft machined guns (not to be confused with machine guns) or energy guns higher than level 35. For example:Short Hunting Rifle level 40, 50Brotherhood Recon Rifle level 40, 50Short Level Action Rifle level 45Short Plasma pistol level 45
---
Yes, I do have the plans...at least I can craft the lower level versions of these guns. The higher level versions are greyed out.
---
41 and Black Friday over 175 hours lol 
---
Would you trade the tse handmade for 10mm ultracite ammo? If so, how much?
---
i'm around L130 and about 400 hours of gameplay I did 90% exploring and not hanging out at WS golf course. 
---
uops i forgot .. PC, im gonna add now
---
Okay i will keep my eyes out for them. And the jacket is actually in game? I hear the raider caged armour is not actually in game but i see some dead raiders wearing it just wondering if the tattered field jacket is the same?
---
Hmmm one thing that probably does not help is that a server only has 24 people on it at any given time. This is a shared level thing as well so it can be hard to get people around your level or end game for any given thing.
---
They need to give us pvp / pve server options with the choice of pre level 50 or end game ones. Have the end game ones go from 24 to 40-50 players per server. That way its not effecting the leveling ones and if your friend is under 50 you can still help. While hitting the end game servers for more event focused stuff.
---
Would also help on the end game servers to have a player hub as well at say Rosies tower.
---
30fps on low settings with a 1080 is -not- normal at all.
---
I'm on a 6700k @ stock, with a 1080 as well, playing on max settings and Fullscreen.
---
I never dip below 60fps even during scorchbeast queen fights.
---
I still get the occasional stutter though.
---
Just bug fixes
---
i have to enter build mode and store the roof peice that covers the door. But if you are unfamilar with the area you would likel walk right over it and not see it. The decoy is to draw peoples eyes to they miss what is hidden.
---
The levels that I can't craft are greyed out in the crafting menu. Examples are
---
Short Hunting Rifle level 40, 50
---
Brotherhood Recon Rifle level 40, 50
---
Short Level Action Rifle level 45
---
Short Plasma pistol level 45
---
So lst me get this straight yall think its hard to make the servers disconnect your character?
---
Would be nice, and would be totally lore friendly and fit with the survival theme. But, I dont see it happening. Sure there are log cabins in game right now, but CAMP uses majority fallout 4 assets. I dont see them adding more camp stuff anytime soon. And even if they do, it'll probably be atomic shop exclusive.
---
My fast travel mat seems to be working more consistently.  They may be tweaking them behind the scenes.  I have a hold over from the beta
---
How long did that take to line up?
---
Do they still give a lot of xp ?
---
I know a way to almost double the amount of xp and that could be useful.
---
Yes, because a group of friends hanging out crafting and chatting together definitely means they must be duper’s right? Or people over capacity definitely didn’t just pick up so much stuff so they can’t fast travel and have no stash boxes nearby. Nope, everyone over capacity hanging out with somebody else is a duper. Because that’s how ignorance works right. 
---
Greyed out.  I can craft the lower levels.
---
2.5k ammo
---
I farmed it from Watoga Emergency Services and Watoga Civic center, legendary drops appear to be random as far as I can tell.  Which is where I found that one.  I always hit up the Leader of the Pack event in the far north east.  Its 3 lvl 5 legendaries, which aren't great but can be interesting.
---
Well according to what someone said in a video, you can have a friend on that server and rejoin it all the time to always have a different inventory for like Grahm. He even shown it in his video. Could of course be, that this only works for Grahm.
---
I did the same thing, except I went up to people and asked them to murder me. I'd rather not be caught off guard, with an inventory full from a looting spree!
---
Yes, I did swap the appropriate science card to craft energy weapons.
---
I wish dude 😥
---
Pretty much the theme of FO76 all together.
---
I never ran nuke zones until about level 120 after I beat all the missions. The rest of my lvels have come from queen runs and other nuke zones. I was level 120 at 244 hours in
---
I would love a cabin wall option. I basically already built a large [cabin](https://imgur.com/PQRTULg), and would really like to make it look extra "real".
---
Ditto, i spent 2 hours getting rid of empath but keeping at least herd mentality,  adrenal reaction,  twisted muscles,  scaly skin,  electrically grounded and carnivore.... I ended up with 17 mutations rofl. Everything but empath and herbivore
---
That'a some solid composition. This is really good.
---
Probably would be better to repost it then
---
all they need to do is add the logical reconnect to last world option freely as you can choose to leave world, and a mechanism to restore a crashed server for folks to get in when the whole thing went down, thus making sure most of their progress isn't lost. this is about developer respecting player/user time.
---
I'd get it if it had MAGA on it so I could pester everybody at Watoga that they have to chip in to build a wall to keep out the undesirables to the south.
---
yeh thats true. 
---
I just got marsupial on a low lvl build. Ended up having to do radaway without starched as I don't have it yet.  How to avoid that?  Get killed in a safe place?  What are odds I can get it again?
---
So far I think I've only dealt with one infinite loading on PS4. I don't have that new patch yet though
---
Or they want to find your camp.  For...reasons.  
---
I don't mind being a fast travel point to someone I meet in-game and they seem friendly/helpful.  But if its some random request from someone god-knows-where, especially at level 100+, I usually decline- they can always drop in to 76 if they really need to.
---
Also the xp was reduced after B.E.T.A if i remember correctly.
---
I wish I could push this to the top, I think taming a cat would be way cooler then having a mega sloth living in my garage and blocking me from getting at workbenches, and then outright attacking visitors to my player friendly camp on the Twin Lakes near the investigators shack.
---
Light metal armor for the win. 
---
Okay thank you
---
Its got high dmg reduction low energy its not bad my personal prefererance is marine armor big bulky but not over blown.
---
lol is it really still bad
---
The fact the game shipped with one in the first place.
---
initial placement of the CAMP is critical as you cannot move the camp area (green build zone) without moving the whole CAMP. once placed you can move the CAMP device to anywhere in the build zone just like any other object.
---
No thanks, I don't want to write an essay.
---
I don't know, but I don't begrudge them the right to try this out. 
---
Despite press coverage making it seem as if the game is barely functional, overall it's a good game. People are enjoying it. 
---
Highly suggest it, there are mods to fix their shitty sorting system as well. I also use mods to highlight items that have materials I want. 
---
Give nexusmods a look. 
---
yep sure
---
Looks like ya got about 500 cap profit sitting there lol 
---
From the sounds of it they are banning anyone that enters it sooo meh.
---
Although troubling about them passing off the items from there before getting banned. Hopefully people are not paying real money for items from there.
---
Atoms cats though thats crazy lol.
---
The mods overall I'm not as worried about.  My issue is using the Reshade (which I would like to do) but not risk getting banned, never mind support being waved.
---
So, do you mean you can’t craft them as in they down show in the craft menu? Or you see it but it’s greyed out?, 
---
If the later double check your perk cards and make sure all your junk required for crafting it is either on you or in your stash. I found an interesting bug when trying to put a mod on my underarmor. I had all the mats but I was holding the flux. Wouldn’t let me craft it till I put the flux in storage
---
Most games have a dev room this one shipped with one they made it so you would literally need to hack into the game to get to it
---
Is there away atound not having the perk card to craft advanced mines ?or do I need to get the perk card first
---
Not on pc
---
Console patch tomorrow will ~~nerf~~ fix them
---
The brown hunter hood outfits don’t seem to be in yet outside of dead bodies.  Tattered field jacket is supposed to drop from Mire Events. It’s on the same loot table as the Leather Coats and those have confirmed to drop for a lucky few. 
---
Possibly, but it feels like the daughter went wrong pretty early. While her relationship with her mother was a part of the reason for betrayal so much of it was really just her.
---
the green build zone is a sphere so you can build ANYWHERE in that sphere. I have seen people climb towers and build up very high. Saw a great one in a old satellite dish.
---
Yes you "DO" get one shot by TSE weapons, without any buffs or bobbleheads whatsoever involved. Just not by pistols or very weak varrients. A TSE weapon does 5x the damage of a base weapon, which means any weapon with a high base damage per shot "100% WILL one shot you, since you don't have 1000 hp"
---
It was once but they are still giving high xp and that’s why it’s in the patch notes for tomorrow 
---
I am going to need some sort of proof to believe that 3 people can crash a whole server for everyone. 
---
This shouldn't be possible to do even with somewhat unstable servers. 
---
The duping glitches causes information issues between the player and the server trying to store the data. (ie. local not global) 
---
This happened to me too, I had a mutation that decreased AP, and when removed I was able to sprint again.
---
There really should be another way to fix it without curing mutations though.
---
I've been using the same controls for over 25 years now. I'm old but I can get lost in my FPS games. 
---
 That's what matters, the immersion we all feel.,
---
Hmu Foreigner124. Got it 2 dayz ago might not be on for a while w/ bball tho
---
Playing it daily.
---
At some times I scream at my monitor because the game is "shit"... like disconnecting after launching a nuke.
---
But then I tag along with my group of usual friends and roam the wasteland again.
---
It isn't when they're isn't another player involved. It's PvE. Congrats, you killed a wall.
---
But this isn't the discussion. You're ignoring it, so now I shall do the same to you. 
---
*signing off*
---
It has potential and that is what everyone is banking on but the fixes are coming it will take a while. Until then, unfortunately, the community is just eating itself against dupers.
---
I wish i had one! I didnt even know they existed. 
---
if ur on pc I could friend you and join a server so u can check it out
---
Triggered? Lol lvl 2 hanging with a lvl 120 at a camp next to a world container is almost gauranteed duping. I have caught several in the act, reported them, PvP them, amd as often as possible, steal their stuff and throw it in a river somewhere. Ignorance is pretending duper behavior isn't specific and identifiable. 
---
I'm a legit 311 and stopped farming around 250.  The rest is just being efficient with my log in time. 
---
800-900. Looking to be hunted for something to do. 
---
I have played through the whole B.E.T.A and got first 50 levels easier than people who started after.
---
Wurd Brutha 
---
Ready to go ign is justinlitviak
---
You should come back in 3-6 months, the game will have been polished and new content will be rolling by then. 
---
Heh. Thanks for the tip.

No worries. Based on the timing of my post, it's easy to understand how you'd conclude why I was likely trying to sell it.  There's no way to guess, "Hey, this guy's hands are probably crippled and he probably keeps blowing himself up with that gun!"
---
 :-D
---
I just did it again. Anglers ran up a hill and found me much more quickly than I hoped they would. Thankfully, the server seems fairly stable these days and I was able to get back to my dropped junk. 
---
Dont let these people fool you, duping isnt good but the servers have been this bad since day 1. 
---
I already do.  I dropped my TSE's and never looked back.  What's your point?
---
I'm confused now
---
If you were a legit duper (you weren't). How would destroying your base set you back?  You would of had a ton of materials to just use 'repair all' and carry on as nothing happened. 
---
What they did would of set a duper, or anyone, back by a few minutes...  
---
just build a welcome mat
---
Exactly, why broadcast it to everyone if it’s not for everyone to get supplies from? I could understand it being only a personal quest if it’s only for you to receive, but most of the supplies drops I’ve gotten stuff from had been requested by other players. Regardless, if they are going in this direction (or maybe it’s just a glitch?) I’ll just drop the items in a bag by the marker.
---
No they didn't. They created a stack of weapons exceeding 2^31-1, which is the largest number that can be represented with 8 bits (11111111) and for whatever reason, that's what Weapon/Armor stack sizes are saved as. This caused the server to disconnect the player when it next attempted to save the player data and when they attempted to rejoin, it loaded the last save it was able to make of the player.
---
What about that causes server lag?
---
Now, if you want to claim that excessive item quantities causes server instability, you're welcome to. However, there's no proof at all that duping itself caused anything in the way of instability.
---
As someone who has run game servers, I wouldn't be surprised if the fairly action-light cheaters, having 2-3+ people all within the same cells and standing around for excess periods of times put less strain on the server than you average player.
---
Why 5x times the damage? Mostly ive seen in videos you can reach 500 dps with certain perk cards equipped, 500 damage if i don't attack that person should be reduced a lot and not one shot me.
---
Just north of watgoa is a long highway with an extrememly long tunnel under it.
---
my camp is one end...the marker is the other end of the tunnel.

You can't seriously be lacking the ability to know what is being asked for proof of. Individual claims new duplicating method provides literally zero proof everyone hops on board anyways
---
You dont need to sink yo that guys level. This sub in particular is infested with these trash players just looking for an excuse for how pathetic their lives are. They cant even disagree with discussions without accusing the other party of being a duper, like the trolls who thought the SBQ didn't scale who acussed me of being a duper yesterday. 
---
I just figured 4 leaf had a lower proc chance than Psychopath. At the moment I'm not running either, but it's good to know! Might go back to using that, but stuck with the one that reduces the amount the crit bar takes to 55%.
---
It's good to see Yong has started the new year recycling other peoples work and Reddit threads a week or two later, maybe if he keeps getting practice he can cut the turn around time to regurgitation to near real time.
---
Cool gun.
---
How is that video so ridiculously low bitrate though?
---
I was going to ask the same thing. Looks nice!
---
The way I understand it, the stand fast is a mod separate from shadowed paint/mod. Shadowed just adds to stealth, so you should be able to mod away. 
---
I prefer the DR from heavy metal armor. 
---
Hmm
---
The Developer room is open 
---
Two Shot Explosive
---
They’re two legendary effects that became the most popular on guns. Dupers then duped them, and now they’re hella common.
---
I dont have that much 10mm ultracite ammo, limited mostly by yello glux, but I do have the electric buzz and ult explosive vent plans
---
Nah, Brahmin Excavator Power Armor. It's Battle Cow time.
---
It’s 4 pieces of metal armor and a rifle by the way 
---
Unless you're running nuke zones solo, get Rad Sponge (up to 3 pt Charisma perk). I have it at 3 pts, and have a total of 9 pts in Cha. I share it with my team, and we're constantly cleansing each other of rads, no Radaway/RadShield/Rad-X necessary. Just have to stay relatively close to your party members. Hell, even a party of 2 works beautifully. Any rads I get are gone quickly, then Healing Factor puts me back at 100% health.  
---
I do have Class Freak, as well.  
---
Currently running Marsupial, Bird Bones, Speed Demon, Healing Factor, Scaly Skin, and Grounded.
---
The exp you were getting earlier in the release was a lot higher than now, I used to level 2 to 3 times per hour before but now I may be lucky to get 1 level per hour doing the same stuff. 
---
Those are both the same fix. 
---
During the whole trade steal scare, some people did show proof that you could see someones inventory without them accepting a trade. All this meant was they can see what you have. It didn't mean they could steal it...
---
Giving up is always better than admitting you might be wrong.
---
Saucy_Buckaroo on psn if you want to make a trade
---
I have the weapon weight one. Then i saw the chem weight one on the bazaar. 
---
No idea. Recorded directly from console then saved on computer and uploaded
---
It was even higher in beta.
---
Yeah it really does, but the fact that limited one day paints are available makes me mad since I may miss this one or may have missed it already.
---
Sadly, i have never seen that mod available.
---
I tried reporting the constant CTD's and server DC's today @BethesdaSupport and was told to run through the whole clear cache, verify game and re-install, all of which I had done before reporting to them. They don't seem to be taking bug reporting seriously at all and just give a robotic response to any complaint from the players. I think Zenimax WANTS to go bankrupt, if this keeps up I will be joining the class action suit against them.
---
There's marine armor 
---
Also im a rifle build so i dont have any weapon weight reduction besides that armor.
---
What is this guys name? I’ve seen so many of his videos here and they’re hilarious 
---
My biggest gripe by far is the 100 yard distance between CAMPs.  If it weren’t in place or was reduced to 20 yards or less then we’d be able to build cozy, or bloody, little settlements. 
---
My lever action rifle disappeared and I don’t know if I scrapped it, sold it, or dropped it. 
---
My favorite weapon. I’m devastated. 
---
Sorry, minor glitch that post was meant to be a reply to the guy that said the previous duping thing didn’t cause server instability. I also agree with you and I think that this guy is just making up shit to get lots of activity on his post
---
Ok now I gotta watch it
---
The other player is directly involved. They're the ones that built the wall.

I've never changed my argument, so I don't know what you're referring to.

Is there a fool proof supet safe way to attack or tag enemies without accidentily aggroing all of whitesprings robot population?

I will. I want a 800 cap bounty, but I have to find a base willing to accept my slaughter haha 🤣

I have yet to get Disconnected after the Patch \[PC\].
---
Please get used to type your Device in your Posts.
---
I think why the playerbase of this "game" earn so much derision is because you are, in fact, the problem.  You will support and defend a company that are so blatantly acting in an exceptionally dubious and anti-consumer manner - which is to say nothing of the ineptitude on display.  People like myself come to this subreddit to observe fanboys in their natural environment, and this community is literally the laughing stock of the wider gaming community.  You're all the beaten partner in a violent relationship with Bethesda, defending him as he beats the shit out of you in front of your kids.
---
Same here...I drop stuff in them all the time.
---
It’s clickbait. If the server crashes, there’s no way to jump back on the same server to grab to transferred items, thus negating the only known duping method.
---
Unless this new method does not abuse the time window between server and client sync. I which case, anything is possible.
---
Don't get me wrong!  I only want to kill you, or be killed by you.
---
Not as rare as it was thanks to duping 
---
I've been getting downvoted for trying to bring attention to this, have an upvote from me. 
---
They haven't banned a single person for accessing the vaults. 
---
:)
---
Proof? That sounds exactly like the sort of thing a ~~duper~~ WITCHHHH would ask for!
---
Burn the Witch for engaging in wrong think against the Reddit hivemind!
---
My apologies I am on PC so that's pretty weird
---
Oh you’re such a little hero. Too bad they don’t have shivs in 76. 
---
its broadcast for everyone to inspire competative gameplay around them. its just rust-like dropboxes
---
The game doesn't scale levels. People were easily 125+ at the end of the beta.
---
Just keep saying and farming and you will get that high.
---
You literally level just as fast at 250+ as you do at lvl 30+.
---
Never cared enough to find out my hours. 
---
This will be the second nerf to whitespring xp, first one was for normal ghouls, now glowing ones. I made most of my xp server hopping whitesprings before the first nerf. Only thing I can suggest is get the well rested stat from sleeping, bobble heads and other consumables. 
---
Prozd is his screen name. I forget his real name. 
---
I made 784 ammo, like I said, out of yellow. Are you still interested in the plans?
---
ditto, as I have to all the threads saying this I will upvote.
---
Sure, sure. Because it definitely couldn’t ever just be someone trying to introduce the game to a friend right and that person has a camp there out of convenience. Nope, definitely not. How about we just assume everyone is a duper and report them. I mean at level 7 I was hanging about with a level 75+ who agreed to take me to a few station fast travel points and then said I could tag along with him for a bit. He must have been a duper too...how naive of me. I mean we even stood in his camp for a bit while I repaired my gear... much wow, totally duper 
---
It is becoming more and more of an issue. Hopefully Bethesda can help remedy this problem by fixing the exploits.
---
Platform?
---
If PS4, I can probably craft some stuff and save the running around to collect stuff. It's not unusual for me to help out low lvl players. 
---
Damn I was going to say t51 power armour but you said no power armour 
---
Nice!  Love the use of tents- I have to start playing around with tent design a bit
---
But if you kill the entire server at once, there is nothing to log back into to get your dupe.
---
They can fix the exploits, but they cant fix the toxic playerbase going on vigilante runs.
---
It’s not him, alternate spawn.  Try again.  Will have pack brahmin and eyebot guards.
---
Perhaps it's a glitch; as it's odd to make someone lockpick it...but their systems are probably so shotty they can't just make it so if the spawner doesn't open, it's flagged. 
---
It's just such an odd, and stupid, choice to do this months after the game launched. This is a major design change. Even at 50 sometimes I get something new out of it, and hell it's fun to just go after. They were also fun to spawn *for* people. 
---
So they're removing "community" even more, just for what? To hope to cause more PvP? 
---
I one time found over 1k .308 ammo in a locker at the Sunshine Industrial Meadow Farm workshop. I about pissed my pants. It really opened the game up for me to be able to wander and not worry about ammo shortages.
---
Careful, that looks like a mod your using and their banning the crap out of even the passive inventory mods.
---
What is "it" that you are talking about?  Where is anything to back this up?
---
Interacting with him is trading with him...
---
Never bother with pocketed because I know I'll be over encumbered soon anyway. I just keep an excavator with calibrated shocks on me to fast travel. I usually use ultralight for the AP, with whatever is the best legendary I've found so far.
---
#notallnoobs amiright? 😉
---
There is already proof that you can crash a server. Just use like 20 treasure maps on one spot. 
---

---
Well, it's not physical proof, but it's been a known potential issue. There was another post last week of a guy that lost his whole inventory because he did the same thing. He even said the entire server would crash if anyone trades with him in this state.

---
So, the need for 3 people would be that one of them is the sacrificial "corrupted inventory" dude. Can't do with 2 as this corrupted dude can't pick up or drop anything, so basically just a server bomb. 
---
the funny part is that when you store everything in the blueprint it will duplicate the items. so you can scrap the items and get unlimited materials. but i cant build anymore. but i can place the stored items
---
OK I'll keep trying 
---
Yeah, you're right, the 764 TSE handmades were earned ethically and the base that said Trading post in neon was just for fun
---
Ask before you assume
---
Gotta make that money off the outrage sheep.

You only have half of it.

Welcome to my situation since I've been playing F76 on Xbox..... though my common issues are game freezes and crashing. 
---
Xbox
---
I think I may have gotten bird bones with starched genes in place. 
---
Gonna have to double check when I get back on. My daughter and her boyfriend just took the tv. 
---
You have to close your doors!
---
It's one of the worst explosives I've ever found lol
---
Even with all that jazz, a good stealthy rifleman could do some work. 
---
1.5k guass would still put out a 300 and little over 700 sneaking. Not to mention crits.
---
And a TSE dragon would still do 500 with damage damage reduction. 
---
You can't edit the ini file, it will just get reset when you start the game. You need a custom ini file, and it won't get you banned 
---
Oh, I also have ultra light marine chest plan!
---
That's Reddit for you 
---
Nope
---
Right. You can't fix stupid lol
---
They were dead before we got out of the vault, right? So it makes sense why the bodies should be laying there.
---
But what they should do make their names hidden/holotapes secret until you're ready for it to be discovered.
---
There's quite a few named corpses scattered around where it makes me ponder how I'm supposed to know who these people are. 
---
I just saw it a couple days ago for the first time at the shooting range. It weirded me out. I had a recon scope on and marked it, once I shot at it it disappeared but the marker kept floating there. I torched the area to make sure he didn't go invisible or something but no luck
---
I live in EU too and it's just one hour ahead in my country, so we might team up later.
---
I'm around 170 and my build is quite flexible, use shotguns, heavy weapons for queen fight, have all the mutations. My mic is broken so i can't speak, but do type fast.
---
Also just interested if it's 4am for you ?
---
Makeshift weapons is for melee.
---
Not sure about guns.
---
My first real experience in this game was finding 4 drops feet away from each other outside flatwoods, it gave me nice loot and was a good surprise. Taking that away is going to what, deny 10 prewar dollars and some dog food and cheap ammo to new players?
---
Why people believe this to be so impossible?
---
I believe you MAY be right, and i've always felt inventory management was problemathic since the start especially at those levels of encoumberance, sometimes wen overloaded  the server kicks me just for browsing my inventory too fast, or wen the game is rendering something too big too fast. 
---
Tonight the server disconnected repeatantly for about 5/10 minutes and i tought it was strange; 
---
About the duping method tough i have a few things i noticed to say: wen you normally log off you create a checkpoint that saves inventory, position, hp, etc.
---
Wen the server disconnects this kind of thing doesnt happen... how could they dupe and save theyr inventory if they make the server crash avoiding the log off checkpoint?
---
No... It's not easy at all, especially solo. The place basically spits out armies of robots at you. When ever you finally manage to kill every robot in the room, the security system already has like 20 more level 40 Assaultrons ready to kick your ass. It took me nearly 2 HOURS just to get to the control room. I take it you've never been in a Silo before.
---
this is the reply you will get if you post to the twitter: **Hello! Please try the troubleshooting in this article if Fallout 76 is crashing on your PC: http://beth.games/2S1Uzk2**
---
Basically a bullshit response to a major problem since the latest patch.
---
I know that reddit is full of people who downvote things for no reason, however it seems to be more abundant on this sub more than any others.
---
wtf are you going on about. 
---
Cool, we do a lot of in character segments on the fallout feed as well, keep going, community needs as much participation in the podcasting realm as we can get.
---
The one truly rare item is Responder Fireman Uniform.
---
Dev room stuffs are loose. Leakers got caught pants-down. Not much time left to cash out. Only way to multiply dev room stuff is to dupe. Working duping measure requires crashing the server.
---
Cue massive, even more frequent server crashes.
---
The patch is coming out for consoles this week so that'll be interesting if that issue continues for you or not.
---
What part of "We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade" was unclear?
---
-check client-side inventory against server-side inventory
---
    
---
-update player inventory
---
-throw an exception to the handler
---
-log the exception
---
-disconnect the player (I don't know much about network programming, but I'm sure it's more than just kick.player(Duplicator001))
---
-despawn all enemies near the player (Destroy all actors and stop running code for AI pathing and idles)
---
-despawn player camp (Destroy all object and update (possibly rebuild) navmesh for the area it was placed in)
---
And if it's an error to such a scale that the player is booted AND the save is reverted, that means that the exception is large enough that a write error could be occurring to the player db and that could throw an error itself, and that could be adding to the stability issue.
---
You drop items friend picks them up leaves then you rollback the server the friend who left keeps the stuff while when you roll back you keep your items too.
---
Okay! Thank you for the info my friend! I will begin my hunt for the infamous tattered field jacket and the leather coat! Wish me luck!!
---
Empath is not mitigated by class freak (bug).
---
What ever bother people I guess, pro duping post, babies crying over how bad the game is, things like that.
---
More game breaking than having a ridiculously OP level 91 deathclaw protecting your base?
---
Yes, ofcourse. “Ask before you assume” just like all the self proclaimed “duper hunters” do before they attack people with any level difference or when players hang out in one of their camps for a prolonged period of time. Ohh wait, they don’t. 
---
Well, yeah. That's what we wanted...them fixing their mistakes.
---
tbh I'm amazed the Fusion Core bug lasted as long as it did, but they had bigger fish to fry in terms of bugs. I agree that I don't really understand the XP changes but I guess everything is for a reason? I guess they thought that a Glowing One shouldn't be considered more value in XP than a Savage/Matriarch Deathclaw?
---
Oh, I'm dumb  you're offering those *whoops*
---
Each individual item in Bethesda games has always had a unique ID. That's not going to stop duping.
---
There is an ID for all classes of an item, called an ItemID, which is not unique.  There is then an ID for the object in the gameworld, called a RefID, which is unique to each entity in the game world.
---
What did you do to get them?
---
Goddamn, watching you prove me right with every lazy post is comedy gold.
---
At least you switched your copy and paste though.
---
I think you mean 32 bits, not 8.
---
This may be a silly question, but..
---
Are you sure you have enough crafting resources for those higher level weapons?  Higher level crafts take more materials than the lower level ones.
---
You should try Ark.

I regret that I have but one upvote to give. Thank you.

Some things to keep in mind about purifiers. 1) All purifiers in your camp count as a single production unit. 2) Each purifier has an internal weight limit and "shuts off" once that is reached. Industrials will never have more than 5 in each purifier.  
---
Multiple purifiers just means more water storage space across multiple purifiers, not faster production. Some have reported seeing decreased production rates when using more than 3 purifiers, but I haven't seen video proof. 
---
Best to save your budget for other uses and go with 2 industrial for top rate with a total capacity of 10 water. 
---
What a roller coaster story

Master holotape not loading is usually caused by having too many holotapes in your inventory. Try dumping all the non-plot ones in your stash.

---
I have never landed my first shot at 95% yet on PC with my quad gauss rifle.
---
I could be wrong but i think deep pocketed can't be found from scrapping. It's got to be plans or mods.
---
&gt; That's literally not how anyone who recounted the "steal through trades" called it though.
---
Which shows how shitty your sources are.
---
But fine, fine, let's just skip over that. What do you call a trade when one player *hasn't* consented to the trade? Might that be, oh, I don't know, **stealing**?!
---
It's literally in the patch notes. If you can't figure out how "trade without consent" = "stealing" then I don't know how much more simple I can make it.
---
I leveled up as a VATS sniper, but VATS in this game just doesn't really have the feel I like so I've switched to this non-VATS rifleman build.  I'm sure there's a damage loss from dropping VATS and crits, but this isn't the kind of game where you have to min/max and perfectly tune your character for a boss fight.  With a two-shot exploding handmade rifle I'm killing trash in 1 shot.  Legendaries are often 1-3 shots.  The great thing about this build is that dropping all the VATS, sneak, and crit perk cards leaves you with tons of room to throw in some quality of life cards permanently so you aren't constantly switching back and forth.  Since AP is no longer a needed resource, I use Dodgy.  With this, I can shoot rushing ghouls point blank with tse weapon if I need to and not kill myself.  I run mutations, so class freak/starched genes are loaded.   
---
Well I’ll upvote you for the username.
---
I seriously don’t understand half of the shit that people say
---
I think I learned this on mine after scrapping one.
---
How ironic.
---
Sure
---
Get a red dress, nothing says “power” like a red dress
---
lol i solo them everytime i do one. with a melee weapon and power armor, it's incredibly simple. its fine if youre new or not as experienced that it takes you that long. however it is very easily solo'd if you know what youre doing. 
---
the pattern and spawn for waves is always the same. especially in the control room. just stand to the hallway just to the left of the first controller spawn, and mow them down as they spawn.
---
also best to clear the room before starting the control room. chances are you arent clearing al the side rooms before starting.
---
It's hard to tell what their actual vision is ya know? Somethings don't work as described and some just work at a different rate until their fixed we can be left thinking it was supposed to be that way to begin with. 
---
I guess once they have it how they wanted it in the first place we can start evaluating how well that works 
---
I have a couple peices of marine armor that way 0
---
A perk card is not required to craft them. They just appear after you start rose’s quest
---
Could you explain how I am supposed to know that an item is duped and how using the ingame trading system that was implemented by the game developers is shitty? As I said in an earlier comment you can never tell who is exploiting and who isnt because people can easily use alts and only keep 1 or two items to sell on them. 
---
I would expect something to defend my base that is close to my level of 137. A level 91 deathclaw can still be killed relatively easy even without TSE. Base turrets are too low level.
---
&gt; The patchnotes you quoted mention nothing about being able to steal player items.
---
What else do you call a trade where one player hasn't consented?
---
I'll maintain skepticism where appropriate, but how are you missing this?
---

False. Members in my group were over 100 no bullshit, and there was a number of reddit posts about people even higher posting their farm methods.
---
How about-- im only allowed to respawn in the same place and he is waiting there to kill me over and over and over as i respawn?
---
Then is it my fault for "going back?" Where else am i supposed to go? Stay dead?.
---
I agree with the other guy. Really nice input. Dick.
---
Alright. I guess there's no point in hoarding them. Will give it a shot
---
Okay, might not be on until later tomorrow night, but sounds good
---
Fuck I've actually been accused of being a duper just for questioning if duping actually crashes the entire server. Since it makes no sense since the duper needs someone to act as an anchor to retrieve duped items from the specific server they are duping in
---
Unfortunate. I was going to save the holos for the holidays this year and unleash them all on the world ): 
---
All you have to do is trade them... Like I do and my team does when we duper hunt. Your high horse looks a little wobbly. Maybe you should get off of it

Apparently people can't figure out how "trade without consent" = "stealing". I wonder how these people tie their shoes.
---
PC 😋
---
Shame we don't have more "Endgame" pistols. The only one that really cuts it is the Western revolver.
---
Asking a question = berating??? Hmmmm
---
352 caps saved!

The good news is there’s only 5 cosmetics on that table.  Bad news is that slot can also be a weapon or armor or plan.  It’s a really narrow chance honestly.  The 4 Mire dailies are a good start and if you can get them to repeat then you’re in good shape.  They’re all stuck for me.  
---
After that focus on Irrational Fear, Heart of the Swamp, It’s a a Trap and Always Vigilant.  I have my doubts about Always Vigilant as it takes place in the Divide. 
---
 lead and steel... need them bullets

I mean, if that's not what Bethesda wants, then they should put a hard limit beyond being simply over-encumbered.  They opened the door.  To me, it only makes sense to have a hard limit, but as long as there isn't one, any player could be insanely over-encumbered, mule or not.  It's not like these players are operating outside the bounds of the game, and that's why I don't call it an exploit.
---
Well, there is a mod for that
---
wow that's really nice
---
&gt;The patchnotes you quoted mention nothing about being able to steal player items.
---
Nor would they ever admit to such a thing if they didn't have to. It destroys confidence in the product.  But it seems to imply it.
---
Hows that good old engine created for client side modded single player games working out for your online multiplayer game Bethesda?  You probably should have have listened when people in other studios told you it was a silly idea to use it.
---
That's the first I'd heard of anyone learning it.
---
I read tricky and assume you meant exploits. If you are just farming enemies or events then thats not an exploit in my book. Why would you complain about people just playing the game without exploiting? 
---
Seems petty.
---
I will be honest as long as duper’s duped items they can scrap into junk like power armor prices duping will be around forever, mainly because theirs bound to be a tipping point with each item where you can outright crash the server trying to scrap them. But what’s the point of making a post about a three person dupe glitch without providing proof what do you want us to do. Spam support with some dude on reddit claimed to find a way to dupe don’t know how to replicate t but fix it. This is just spreading fear. Don’t lie you made this post just to get karma not because you care about the glitch.
---
Good luck on finding another, try wendigos and grafton monsters
---
Thought the same thing.
---
Ha! I had the exact same experience! It was an excellent happenstance. This change is sad. I have 70 of the requisitions and I like to drop them in the lower level areas. This change blows. 
---
If the same 4 or 5 same topics didn't get posted maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

Not sure if this will help, but I had this problem with PA. I found that I had to unbulk some of the bulk items to be able to craft the PA. Took me logging n and out a few times and trying a whole host of other things to fix it. Good luck, hope this helps.
---
The griefer gets a bounty after attacking innocent people or their camps, or breaking into people's locked property and stealing.  It isn't so much "anti-griefing" as minimalizing griefing and making it part of the gameplay loop when it does happen.
---
My personal opinion is to not play around with farming mutations unless you’re planning to do max rank of Genes and Class Freak (5 pts of Luck total). Without them you’re playing a time consuming roulette of trying to keep the good ones and lose the bad. Class Freak will make the negative effects of all mutations pretty minimal and then you’re not as worried about what one you get. Unless it’s Empathy efff that mutation all around.
---
thanks!
---
This is 100% the best way to implement this sort of idea. A worldwide buff would be a cool reward. Depending on the type of buff, it could even be scaled with how well you did- maybe 2 levels of successful completion. 
---
I’d like to see ammo Smith perk allow you to scrap ammo to its components, like gunpowder lead and remake it to something else.
---
E.g  spare 1000 rounds of .38 remade to .44, .45 or 5.56.
---
My only guess is that if three people force themselves to be disconnected at the same time, using the methods the previous duping exploit relied on, the server may be tricked into thinking that everyone on it may be having issues and restart itself.  These are pretty low population servers and three people being forcibly disconnected at once is a relatively large percentage of the server population, so it might trigger some kind of QoS assessment to take place if that many people are disconnected at once.
---
I agree they should not be able to force a server restart if things were as stable as they should be.
---
As for your last sentence, you basically restated what I said above.   They fixed that information mismatch when a single person is forcibly disconnected, obviously, which is why these efforts now involve taking down the entire server at once before it has a chance to employ whatever re-syncing method was used to fix the original problem.
---
A good 3 minutes. The idea popped in my head and then quickly realized I didn't have the pose. Glad there was something in the atom shop.
---
Sorry. I am on PC. If we were on the same platform I'd just give it to you. 
---
True, some of my posts with just questions, trade offers or suggestions get 1 or 2 downvotes.
---
Why do people murder?  Or molest kids?  Or dress up in animal suits?   
---
Who know?  You’re trying to get answers to something that the people who display such behaviors can barely explain themselves.
---
Thanks for your input, i was thinking farming events brotherhood related maybe, and yeah mondter mash is always a pain lmao
---
Yes, because we all know that EVERYONE checks first right. Most definitely not people going “look at that base, there is a high level player and a low level one! They must be duper’s, let’s destroy it”. 
---
Gonna take me a while to plat - I'm not a team player XD
---
This is exactly what I’m talking about.
---
Kids that feel they have some form power out side of they're parents telling them to clean up there room all the time?
---
Yeah seems some are just trigger happy. Upvotes included. Idc really I just use the "new" feed 
---
Raider rusty is an arm mod for power armor.
---
As someone who played it at midnight during it's release the Nov before, I can say that what people remember of WoW's early days is much worse than the reality. Besides a queue, some intermittent downtime, and getting your hand stuck in a corpse, it was the most polished mmo experience there had ever been. Shit, it was near flawless during beta, only a huge influx of players exposed database inefficiencies and server load limitations.
---
I think those are player hosted servers are they not?
---
Likely why it requires other people.  I have not looked into this 'new method', but my assumption is that instead of the duped items being in another container, the copies are in someone else's inventory.
---
Same.
---
I originally camped near Flatwood just to get/share those drops. I don’t recall seeing anything in the update. As someone else said , it’s not like they have that great loot or anything. 
---
This whole "if you buy legendaries that are likely duped you are just as bad as the dupers" mentality is so fucking stupid. I'm as pissed as everyone else about the duping effects and consequences but lets be real; Pandora's box is open and it isn't going to shut. Why should I NEVER be allowed to trade for the weapons I want because of duping?  There is no way to 100% verify if anything is duped. It sucks that it came to this but people need to get over it. Trading shouldn't just be shamed and ruined forever because of duping. It's also incredibly unfair that we basically have swathes of people running around with rocket launchers while many others are stuck with BB guns. Especially considering the PVP implications and the hordes of people going around destroying other people's stuff and harassing them. This wont ever be undone. Either accept what is or go play a different game.
---
It’s faster to hop then cuss.
---
They are using ways that were not patched, and impact the servers greatly. You should get proper information before being a sarcastic ass.
---
I'm level 60, I'm wondering if this had something to do with 3 guys hurling cryo grenades at me and a level 39 friend while were fucking around at a random campsite full of scorched.
---
Yeah they’re peer to peer servers
---
I don't think even they know what their vision is. Look at how the game is designed. The changes they've made. I'm losing faith. 
---
Do you have the correct amount of junk items? Highest level requires more junk. 
---
If she ends her sentence with a preposition... and weighs the same as a duck... SHE'S A WITCH

Have you tried transferring them into a world object? I used that to get rid of some coins I couldn't drop. 
---
Very popular spot
---
Dude, exactly how I feel.   I want to give this game a chance.  I love it.  But at level 58, and have not even started the story line, thinking that I'm going to have to play through hundreds of hours of constant dc and blue screens makes me want to just forget the game, especially when the new far cry is released.  
---
I'll admit, I feel better when I leave Bethesda mean messages from my PlayStation everytime it blue screens.  Childish? Yes.  Saving me from snapping my controller in half after I spend 20 minutes getting 3 workshops and defending them? Absolutely!
---
I want to make an “air/head” joke here but it’s 3:30am and I’m tired, so please make up your own. 
---
Small outfits can't patch their stuff, but in FO76 it's server instability that allows it. There's too much copy paste from fo4 with net coding sewn on and it's like frankenstein's monster.
---
As long as the game is truly online and nothing essential is determined client side, then the exploits will eventually be shut down. But it may take a while.
---
Mk3 stealth boys and secret agent perk in agility, one of those babies will was you 6 minutes. 
---
Well, you're mostly right here, the only thing is you don't level up as fast on 200 as you do on 30.
---
Go high perception and high agility.  Take the three rifleman perks along with tank killer to help punch through higher armored enemies. Take charisma to at least 3 and get at least rank 2 of lone wanderer. High agility helps with sneak, take what you can with sneak and the sneak critical more powerful perk. Find instigating legendaries to help reduce the number of shots needed. Add max tier concentrated fire and you'll be one shotting most enemies with head shots for a while.
---
Also, there's no need to restart. Keep gaining levels and just respec your character over time instead of giving it all up.
---
That's rad as hell.  It's like a Jojo pose.
---
I don't see any implication of that there 
---
I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Compared to most other social media, I think the average Redditor is pretty fair and sensible.  It's still a bell curve though:)
---
Second point. This is a pvpve game. People player hunt regardless. You lost this. Seriously. You want fun and rainbows all day go play my Little pony. And, on top of that, this point youre arguing is 100% unwanted here. 
---
My post was about saving the people that don't engage, duper or not they die tomorrow on console. 
---
This was about mutation check (thanks to whoever mentioned that term) with a bounty.
---
The derail was ignorant and now I can't stop equating you to a 12 year old o' valiant knight
---
You've obviously played some survival games and been in this bis a while xD 
---
That was only the one you shot down for the nuke keycard. 
---
The supply drops were just like any other cache.
---
I find it hard to believe that duping methods were patched by Bethesda's own words yet the servers got even worse. 
---
Sounds like you people are just looking for a pathetic excuse to defend shit servers in general
---
PlayStation unfortunately, thank you though.  Most of the people I have met are friendly like you
---
Actually you do. Theres no difference. 
---
Spot on schultzche
---
I was able to steal shit... that one was real. 
---
mine always produce but its like their inventory is capped at 5
---
just sit around your camp doing something else and check back to stock up
---
It's completely unplayable.  I think I've spent more time today reentering my password and sitting through loading screens than I did playing.  Now it freezes up so bad sometimes, that I can't even open up task manager.
---
The best is when everyone shares strange in numbers also. Then it gets real fun. 
---
Letsseeifitplaysout.gif goes ×here×
---
There are that many you tubers now doing Gameplay reviews and how to and tips and tricks before you buy ect it’s easier to get views when your criticising games and it’s more popular to complain now days because gamers usually get whatever they want all you have to do is have a cry about something you find unfair and it gets changed to suit gone are the days where when you bought a game that was it 
---
Beca down voting comments on reddit is totally comparable to murder and child molestation. 
---
Equip ‘Good with Salt’ so they don’t expire, then sell the excess amount the next day too.
---
Any TSE weapon for sale is duped. No one would ever get rid of one.
---
^^ you are correct.   And also, two of my pieces are deep pocketed.  
---
There is, i can even show the difference in a day or two.
---
I watched a guy blow himself up once went to his bag and he had 5-25k of every mat, I know you could get some mats by the trap glitch back then but no way did he get 17k screws and 22k springs legit.... 
---
They patched the common way to do it, which was posted on youtube etc. The other ways are less known, and cause major issues. It sounds like you people are just looking for a pathetic excuse to shit om Bethesda at every turn. I wouldn't doubt that you're a duper, because rhe justification is always fuck Bethesda. Downvote me and delete your comment like the last failure.
---
The tiered reward would be cool.  Maybe only a partial timer based on percent completed.
---
amen
---
Some of the fixes are questionable. Wtf game are we even playing anymore? Some of those bugs made more sense as being intentional than something that needed fixing. 
---
I need that.    How do I get it?
---
Sure but don't know about the weight plate?
---
I could hardly decipher what you're even trying to say, but I think I'm on your side. 
---
oh, sorry. compensator &lt; muzzle &lt; suppressor
---
and it's 15 &gt; 20 &gt; 25, not 10, 15, 25 like I said previously
---
There it is. I must be a duper. Way to actively make this sub worse with your MaCarthy tactics. Blocked.
---
Just as any other TSE Rifle
---
When did I ever support Bethesda??? I was just saying this guys post was way off topic and kinda proves OP’s point
---
I’ve got excavator armor but not the calibrated shocks mod.   Where do I obtain?
---
Obviously but what about the weight plates.
---
There is a difference in trying to pvp to challenge someone, and with victimising them out of circumstance. Two completely different thought processes, one of which is just being malicious. But ofcourse, claim to act superior while using the good old “omg are you 12” insult. About what i’d expect from some self righteous “duper hunter”. I mean targeting people you assume are duper is most certainly completely different to being a “12 year old valiant knight” right? 
---
I like that I can basically play it like a single-player FO game, albeit with the added hassle of food and water timers. 
---
I do not like that I always feel like I am short on ammo. 
---
Not in this case it seems
---
Yeah I have that, I’m currently rocking the bomber jacket though. 
---
Happens when you have almost 300 (suspected) isolated designers and programmers working on a game and you just kinda mash it together. I guess they are now making communication better between the teams working on the game and it shows, I see improvement.
---
What matters to me is that the game is fun and I keep playing because of it. The moment that I say "Wow, I'm not enjoying this" is the moment I stop playing for a while and wait for more content and patches. 
---
Best: That feeling when you get to the end of the silo and launch a nuke. 
---
Worst: Getting blue-screened five minutes later.
---
Oh look another one of the dupers getting mad for being called out gtfo let's see how you stand up to a quad explosive the dragon bitch.
---
&gt; -log the exception
---
We hope.. :P
---
2-3 cheaters in the same cells (almost always). 1 relog for 1 cheater every 10 minutes or so. That's an average of 1 relog per person every 20-30  minutes.
---
There's plenty of completely legitimate people who will relog more than that and there's no evidence to suggest that
---
&gt; -despawn all enemies near the player (Destroy all actors and stop running code for AI pathing and idles)
---
The cell dump is random, it's not instant. You can test this yourself by fast traveling to the other side of the map and then back again. Almost always when they relog it wont have despawned anything in the cells they're in. 
---
Since they almost always had company anyway, even if the server checked the cells to purge while the dcing cheater isn't online, it wouldn't have purged them since they were still in use.
---
The cells wouldn't repopulate without first being unloaded, which they're not by what they were doing.
---
Yes, every 2-3 relogs they'll get some new enemies. That's every 20-30 minutes to spawn 1 lot of enemies for 2-3 people, that's far less spawning than your average person just playing the game as it was intended.
---
&gt; And if it's an error to such a scale that the player is booted AND the save is reverted, that means that the exception is large enough that a write error could be occurring to the player db and that could throw an error itself, and that could be adding to the stability issue.
---
That's a lot of 'maybe', I've been quite clear that there's no proof of the claims. It's possible that a child saying "I don't believe in fairies" kills one too, but I'd need to see some proof of it before I accept the claim blindly.
---
There's been too much of people just accepting whatever fits the narrative they want to have and pushing it as though it's fact since this game came out.
---
Blocked so that i can't punch through your kindergarten logic once more? I didn't say you were, but that i qouldn't doubt it. Bethesda has quite a few things they need to get their ass in gear about, but the server instability is not all on them. 
---
I have a ladder, a stash, and some workbenches with floating turrets.  The bare minimum.  I won't build more until it gets me a bigger stash.
---
I’ve never seen him with both trade/interact like you would with station vendors or responder vendors. Grahm has always just had “interact” which launches the trade window. 
---
I'll be logging on tomorrow either around 430 or 9pm ( depends on when I can get my tv back from my kids) send me your gamer tag I can hook you up with the gears and screws I don't have the extra black titanium or springs
---
Vendor Bot Responder got interact too if i remember correctly
---
But what about the weight plates
---
After I got my TSE lever I got a 2* one later while farming Whitesprings. I sold it to my friend for 500 caps. So there is at least one reason someone would sell one, they already have another one. No point is storing 15-20 pounds in your stash when you can sell it
---
I'm so envious seeing you kill stuff without getting the rubberbanding health effect like I do every time I try to kill a scorchbeast.
---
Congratulations
---
I solo it on xbone without too much problem. You do need a good amount of stimpacks/healing.  Also hacking and letting the turrets and robots kill each other helps as you work your way through.  I run it as melee with power armor.  My first time was when I was in my 70s.
---
For the people saying they have a hard time with soloing it.  I think that the robot aggression can glitch when they respawn as you run through and they just wander around not attacking.  It's happened a few times for me during my runs which makes it much easier.
---
Fair enough, thanks :) 
---
Fuckin eh, god forbid that guy to ever reproduce. Cant imagine what the "Legand in his own mind" would do if he was actually a cop.
---
I dumped luck of the draw 2. It rarely procs.
---
I'm on console so I'll retest tomorrow.
---
1st of all I was referencing a couple of posts I had read, second that dragon isnt anything to be scared of. You are exactly what I was talking about... A witchhunting little troll child with nothing better to do then ruin other people's experience to make yourself feel like a man since you fall oh so short in the real world.
---
good on you!
---
&gt;I wouldn't doubt that you're a duper
---
Can you idiots stop blaming anyone on the sub you don't like of being a duper? Its really fucking pathetic and immature btw.
---
Me and my friends have founds that causing server lag isn't even that hard.
---
Craft the same item really fast about 20 times and everyone in my group got the "connection interrupted" message. Try it again to make sure it isn't coincidence, have somebody else do the same to make sure it isn't just you. It happens every single time if you craft too fast.
---
He is tied to the watoga train station cap pool
---
Hear that ladies? Take your heavy guns and shove it!
---
Just saying people are getting callee supers for no reason.
---
Would be ironic if your dragon was a byproduct of duping. 
---
THANK YOU. These fools are far too rampant on this sub
---
And here we have a prime example of the maturity and intellect of a large number of “duper hunters”.
---
Would be ironic if his dragon was a dupe. 
---
It's the same reason I always do AWOL when I see it.  Guaranteed one level 52 ☆☆☆ Gutsy, sometimes multiples.

Obama says "kong pow penis"
---
Damn, things got personal. 
---
That the dev room is essentially a CAMP built by the developers.... who wanted individual storage containers, complete with named containers and the ability to put stuff on the shelves...
---
Us regular players don't deserve that. 
---
Same with me man it's making me not even want to play until I hear something about fixes
---
So you resort to insulting me irl and you dont know me just shows who is the child 
---
He made my point for me.
---
Don't worry doubting Thomas, you'll have your proof on Jan. 15 if they haven't / can't fix it.
---
so youre looking for witches to hunt? op so confuzing. are you trying to shift the blame from the game ruining dupers?
---
I guess you're another one that doesn't understand how words are used? Dupe your brain cells please.
---
You messaged them to ask why they did that? I would have never even THOUGHT to do this. I would’ve assumed they’re just griefing
---
You sound like a dickhead so people are reacting. No misinterpretation is happening. 
---
Sick Bible reference
---
You know it is, he most likely bought it and it is a copy from a long line of dupes.
---
"I'm sick of people thinking they're richouse zealots who can dole out punishment as they see fit"
---
That's a very interesting statement to be making right after basically explaining you'd do the exact same thing :p. The cycle of madness continues!
---
While I'm all for duper hunts, I do think it's gotten out of hand regarding how one can actually be certain someone's duping or not.
---
Either way I think it's kind of hilarious how the biggest factional PvP event to hit the game so far has nothing to do with the existing factions in the game, but the ones within the community lol.
---
Known bug, and the last patch now enables it without even trying.
---
...West Virginia...
---
Not quite sure but he probably took the advantage of an issue when after update every stored item doubles.
---
The bibles gay bro.
---
I think hes advocating talking about the bug and getting the word out that it exists, not to go ahead and dupe as much as you can
---
Turrets in whitesprings? Time for a nuking. 
---
I have two characters at a combined level 160. Never used power armor or VATs. I do have a melee weapon though for easy enemies to save on bullets. I have one point each in the Rifleman perks for 30% extra rifle dmg, 1-3 points in Bloody Mess for up to 15% bonus dmg, and 3 points in Tank Killer. 
---
&gt; Someone at bethesda has been playing too much PUBG
---
Servers not laggy enough
---
It's not user error if the interface indicates you are selecting one item to trade, and another item is selected instead. That's an issue with the interface or the game.
---
I'm saying people are attacking random people and calling them dupers with no evidence.
---
You don't have the new patch that's causing more DCs yet. Soon, my young padawan.
---
The second one actually DID! You can see it right before i reload at about 30s. He was also noticeably harder to kill than the first one, which was higher level at that.
---
The dev room is a place for the devs to play in you could call it a camp but really it's more of a playground where only the elite are allowed to play
---
A hand full of redditors explicitly on this subreddit are easy to disgruntle

One critical remark and they will take their time to go through your entire comment history and downvote all(!) comments. One of them tried to direct chat and pm about me 
---
You on xbox? I'm looking to rebuild my house into somthing cooler, in the same location. 
---
You let a lvl 14 go? Just shoot them and take all their screws n springs LOL. People who do that shit need to learn the hard way and it's nothing malicious, especially if they're not paying attention to the [steal] prompt on their screen. I've taken bunch of ppls' shit and will do it every time somebody picks my lvl 0 locks in my base or workshops.
---
suprised he could power up the rocket launchers. when this glitch happens you cant attach the wire to the duped ones.
---
Yep, no perks exist to reduce crit damage so at this point they're still king.
---
How much damage would a TSE Dragon dish out without Crits?
---
I have seen a honey beast at the fallen vertibird and been unable to tame  so i am going to assume no until i hear otherwise!
---
On PC you press “f” while examining an existing door, container or resource (water, ore, wood, fusion/ammo) so on. 
---
You can create the highest level of lock you can currently pick. Everyone mentions the perk was removed. But not that you can only create a lvl 0 lock pick required lock otherwise. 
---
I lock all my stuff bc it makes me feel better but if anyone picks the lock or takes it who isn’t on my team gets wanted anyway. 
---
So keep it in mind. 
---
No... The edit expalains, its not the same when you have a cause to do so. Its avenging someone who just had their base destroyed, not attacking random people on the off chance they are duping or what have you.
---
Except there ARE a lot of people that need to get rid of things they don't need/have space for. Including good weapons and armor.  Besides, literally any item can be duped so should we just never trade for anything ever?
---
I think they’re doing that, and bringing it up here. We know Bethesda checks the forum so just making it visible in the hopes OP gets PMd and they move forward is ok. 
---
One nest near the body that starts the enclave quests, then facing away from the elevator, one each in the back left and back right corners of the cave. I find the holotape typically in the back left. 
---
Just make the game single player and we won't have these problens
---
Yeh but after a while the game caught up witht the lag.
---
Actually “duper hunters” are worse than the duper’s. A duper is only an issue to those who buy into duped weapons. It trashes the player economy for those weapons but doesn’t directly cause issue to individual people. Duper hunters however maliciously target players, often with no evidence other than them either being two diffeeent levels or spending a prolonged period of time in a camp. And proceed to try and kill the player, destroy the camp, and even target them through world hopping. It’s like setting a room on fire to kill a spider. 
---
You don't have to. Part of the glitch makes them actually work without power when you server swap
---
On Xbox but thanks for the offer!
---
"I want my legendary, I don't care if it was created through nefarious means &gt;:*(" That's not childish at all.
---
Dude I'm level 77 and never found one. I hate these random recipes and plans, I should just be able to find one.
---
No proof? Well then, OP is a duper. I don't need proof if he doesn't, right?
---
The more you go on the more full of it you come across. 
---
Its gotten pretty stupid, I've been called a cheater for various things too (like suggesting Bethesda not just automatically ban everyone with the stack size exceeding 10k of literally any item, lol).
---
Best to just downvote/ignore them for the most part I think, they'll screech themselves into irrelevancy before long.
---
Apologist.
---
The point is, they gave themselves the very absolute basic things... which we don't even get. It shows me how out of touch they are.
---
Had 3 servers rolled back on me last night, maybe this was why? It was the first time it's ever happened so Idk. 
---
Well damn I got both of those and see them activate but never bothered to check if they were repairing anything.
---
You need to becareful about this. Those that grief can invite you to group to learn of your base location. Once there they will leave party and level it.
---
Gotta be super bloody careful as seen a rise of griefers lately (pc).
---
So if you do accept just watch where they go if they teleport to your camp leave server before they wreck it and block them.
---
His last sentence indicates otherwise, to me.
---
Self reviving doesnt seem like a great legendary.  There are many others that help avoid dying.  You can generally run back to your corpse in that minute.
---
If you die enough for this to be a big convenience, i would still recommend something that works toward prevention.
---
The one names "travelling vendor" isn't actually a vendor.
---
It's all hearsay, but I'm pretty sure the claims that people using mods were being banned was a false story. And you know how gaming journalism goes, when a story seems juicy about the thing everybody loves to hate these days, all the sites will run it.
---
From what I've heard (and to clarify, this is gossip at best) the story came from one youtube streamer who was using actual cheating programs, a client hook that is very much against the rules, and he made a video claiming he was banned for using mods when it was really he was a very blatant cheater.
---
Whatever the case, all those stories that ran a few weeks ago were tied to that one case, and the "many players" cited in the articles were just that one guy.
---
Ikr haha. OP would blow up in RUST.
---
Yes, I've finally got around to using stealth boys and they're a tremendous help for situations like that.
---
Exactly. I was too wordy without enough actual explanation but this is the problem I was trying to arddess.
---
That CAMP was at least far away from the clubhouse. So no enemies would typically spawn there. 
---
Let me duplicate your upvote
---
Job well done I say. Hear me out.
---
 At least SOMETHING in this game should have you worried about dropping your loot.
---
It's a Fallout game, but it's really quite different at the heart of it. Don't get me wrong, I really quite like the game and I've put a ton of time into it. But fair warning - this game is quite different from the previous installments. There's less emphasis on the main quest line and instead there's more repeatable content - events, workshops, nuke zones, and some PvP should you choose to engage in it. For me the highlights are: 
---
1. being able to play Fallout as a coop game
---
2. being able to launch a nuke, watch it drop and form a huge mushroom cloud, then run into the nuclear fallout to kill radioactive monsters. 
---
I highly recommend it but if you are expecting a really strong main quest line I think you'll be disappointed. This game is mainly a shoot and loot IMO.
---
If you know how to replicate the dupe, you need to report it to Bethesda with a step-by-step guide on how to do it. Making a post about it on Reddit isn’t going to help much.
---
Yep fuck this, I'm out. Tired of not being able to play. When I am able to I can't even join my buddy's team so what the fuck is the point?
---
You do know what the dev room is right basically those individual storage containers are basically spawn boxes each fallout game has them loot respawns in there every 72 hours in game time 
---
when i got mine, my teammate found 2 in the bots inventory. i guess him having 2 at a time is common when it spawns.
---
Same. You normally go to see the vendor to sell things or buy something, so its easy to hit the register and see what is inside.
---
The lag that is killing me currently when I'm running around an area that's been nuked or otherwise has a lot of players around, and I have to hit the action key repeatedly to pick something up.  Because I'm spamming the action key, the latency effect means the server interprets my action key input as a long hold, so I'm left exiting my PA in heavy rads -- let's just call it Rad Rain -- and I wither and die unless I can get back into my PA pronto.  
---
This also happens when I'm besieged by thronging hordes of glowing chubby diseased ghouls, who I assume just want my autograph and are possessed of very poor social skills.  I continue to sing Morrissey's "You're the One for Me, Fatty," because that's what my educational system did to me.
---
Now that you mention it, it does kind of seem that way
---
I too have noticed this.
---
I then stupidly invested some  time on certain posters and their post history....yeah.
---
I can sum it up for you. A whole new generation of gamers have come on board.
---
Wouldn't you consider mutations to be buffs? o.o
---
I'm more pissed at the level 20-30's running around that one shot you in passive mode because they got a duped explosive weapon and they duped hundreds of explosive bobbleheads and stacked them and join a new server before it runs out to reset the timer. Every fucking server on PS4.
---
"This community is the best and most friendly."
---
No it isn't. It's the shittiest, I can't do anything without getting pk'd constantly.
---
I love it.  
---
I did something similar with my two little brothers. I just got a message from another player that I’ve been reported for duping. I get it, it looks fishy but I’m just trying to play with a few low levels and show them the ropes.
---
I think those of you on console who're running into this will be happy come this Tuesday. PC player and every time ibeogged in since the latest patch, it remembered my grenade equip. Cheers!
---
Leave it to Bethesda to inadvertently create an atmosphere where high level hunt low levels based on suspicion of cheating......
---
Trailer Park Vaultboys
---
Correct. As I said In another reply items are saved when a player quits so giving someone your items then crashing the server is the same as storing your items in a container and crashing yourself. 
---
But my dad’s in the workers union and said that I don’t have to finish a quest if I don’t want to. “It’s my right” 
---
The dupers are scared and trying a PR blitz I see.
---
I just lost about 4k worth of mods I bought for my X-01.  This is complete horseshit.  I'm a strong supporter of the game but this has me stunned that they wouldn't have this shit fixed.
---
Private servers means :
---
》 I can play solo (its how i like my Fallout games)
---
》 If i do group with others i can make sure they are not griefers going to wreck my camp.
---
》 Hopefully alot more stable.
---
》 Modders can fix any issues with the game and give us QOL stuff in the game not just interface stuff.
---
Most vendors will have them, but rare. They are just called calibrated shocks. You can tell it's excavator because it says it scraps for titanium. I also have motion assist servos for extra carry weight as well.
---
Regular pump shotty with crippling perks and a two-star MM gauntlet to mop them up.
---
You feel proud of yourself for nuking somewhere, causing devistation and slaughtering so many wild animals? YOU’RE A MONSTER!
---
&gt;At least SOMETHING in this game should have you worried about dropping your loot.
---
Have you met a pack of glowing Yao Guai yet? XD
---
Fucking **run**
---
It did not prof ? My character. Now I’m getting DC every hour or so from the new dupe. If this new method gets out shit will be bad. 
---
Spent the last 2 days doing the whitespring bunker quests, then getting all my nuke code pieces and other crap I needed. Logged on tonight to go to site Alpha and launch my first nuke.
---
After about 7-8 disconnects while in the silo (causing me to start over and over again) I finally got my nuke launched. Then as I'm leaving the bunker right when it was about to land I get disconnected.
---
I tried reconnecting via the social tab using recent players but none of them was the right server. So with every server I join my list is getting bumped by new recent players and I never found it :\\
---
Then I also realized my camp was stored and I lost a bunch of stuff but w/e.
---
I guess that's what I get for soloing my first nuke. Grrrrrr
---
i've seen a few people 350+ lol.
---
Congratulations :)
---
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
---
It helps if you put pipboy to yellow setting
---
same story here, on pc.  level 84 and 37 to try another build.  works fine as a single player game with the occasional friend or family to wander around with.  lately i've had too much stuff so I give items and ammo to low levels.  Heart emote and a brown bag - dropped 1st with 1 scrap to prevent losing items to the void - do the trick.
---
Respect. I built my camp under a bridge hidden by normal view and behind some hanging moss. Only way in is a pressure plate under water that rolls up the hidden garage door. I built a tiny base above ground as a decoy too. 
---
I used to have a camp where yours was but mole rats kept spawning inside the floor. Whatever you did seems to have worked a lot better. +1
---
Wait to you accidently scrap one. Now you have a spare!
---
If you think about it were all monsters inside...
---
Seems you are accusing me of being a duper, its not the case but you are free to believe what you will. I never said I agree with duping, just that the duper Gestapo needs to be stopped because the majority of us arent dupers and innocent people are getting trolled over it.
---
I'd actually really like to be able to get trailers, campers, or other prefab structures. Not pre-blueprinted, but actual prefabs. It'd fit in with the environment, and it'd probably take up less budget than building a house from floors and walls and stuff, allowing for more decor. Morgantown Airport has some neat campers, and they could actually put some variants in the atom shop.
---
Yeah but the only one coming into play in that video is Eagle eyes for the extra critical damage.
---
As John Fogerty says,"keep on chooglin."
---
If we think about it we're all monsters inside
---
I mean you can very well argue they're literally doing just that. Avenging the community. They do have a cause to do so despite how dumb the process they take is.
---
And I highly doubt they're going to literally any random person and killing them because they might be a duper. There's probably some reasoning for who they choose, which as we've seen isn't exactly always correct.
---
Either way, I don't really see the real harm in anyone going around killing anyone in-game for whatever reason. The game's practically built for that regardless  of how you want to play so there's no real difference between someone killing you for a reason and without reason in terms of gameplay. Kill someone for fun or because they're a duper. No difference. 
---
The real issue is when they take it out of the game and start harassing through messages. That's dumb.
---
I just don’t see why I can’t cook with purified?  Fine I can’t make adhesives with boiled, but what is preventing me from cooking with purified?
---
That makes no sense homie are you having a stroke.
---
duping isnt really the entire issue. and even with the update that came out people are reporting its worse so my hopes arent high for us console users. people where so angry and up in arms about duplication they started hunting people just being on. this community went from super helpful and amazing to unbelievably toxic. its really out of hand
---
Can confirm after testing that this happens (at least to me) if you have the Tesla rifle equipped. If you equip another weapon, it doesn't crash (PS4). Maybe the game can't handle the double lighting effects of the rifle and decon shower? Hope this helps.
---
Raider armor is used when you want to either handicap yourself or theres currently nothing better available.
---
I also would like too know this 
---
An obvious method that isn’t realistic unless you already duped mats is to just overflow the server with a massive stack of items being scrapped at once. Personal experience tells me that 250k items will always crash a server regardless of the game. Easy fix though just limited amount of items scrapped at 100. 
---
Can you show me I want to give my friends some serums
---
I just run the mutagen Carnivore and get all my daily food requirements from raw meats.  Living and lootable dead animals are everywhere.
---
Bait for what?
---
...smog filled mountains...
---
Wallpaper worthy, congratulations.
---
Personally that wouldn’t be much help for me. My int is only 5 in my current build so depending whether I want to build armour, guns, melee, energy weapons etc I wouldn’t have the points to equip them all anyway and would need about 4-5 different load outs for each one. So might as well just manually equip them xD
---
Leather, Metal, Raider, Combat and Robot all have light, sturdy and heavy versions. Heavy and sturdy leather armor plans shows up responder vendors fairly frequently, but the others are only random drops and world spawns, as far as I know. 
---
Fortunately they're not important in the long run because you can unlock every mod by scrapping light arms.
---
Oh shoot I went to go do something. If you still need help will you be on in about 25 min? 
---
This game is as good as dead
---
Can u dupe some serums for me
---
They do.  And are often just as short on judgment.
---
I’m on PS4 too and my game crashes on average once per hour. 
---
I'm reminded of area events in the MMO game Final Fantasy 14.
---
Some are common and appear at a regular interval like we see in Fo76, but others are quite rare and drop special loot, some have to be triggered by completing smaller events, and some are massive events that often draw the entire server to join in.
---
I'd like to see this game take cues from popular MMO games in stuff like this.
---
Why downvotes?
---
Also by no perks i meant the rifle perks like Commando and Rifleman
---
Oh look the person who does not even play the game trying to stir shit again. And good the people that got banned deserve it.
---
"A new low? How could they do this?"
---
Gotta get those jabs/hooks in
---
Prof is, that I’ve done it and it’s true, even the dupe/glitch servers that I’m a part aren’t taking part as it’s game breaking on a whole other level. 
---
I appreciate your willingness to help - but I am on PC :(
---
Carnivore is very far from being bad. I dont need to manage hunger at all with it.
---
What about jetpack and callibrated shock schematics do any vendors sell them because of all the treasure maps I had I haven't found any of these
---
Yes, the thing I've been getting must be different then. I can be stood still and it just keeps stopping, I've had it doing this for ages and just can't find out why
---
Nah that was selecting items as the UI was loading my dude. No 'stealing' was happening at all.
---
Proof?
---
Will if they ever add a hand chainsaw and a boom stick like Ash has in the evil dead I'd definitely rock those. Time to kill some deadite scum
---
Youtubers have but thats all
---
Any time I saw low level people I'd go drop one from the relay tower near Flatwoods.  Add a little extra loot to the box and they'd never even know I was there.
---
Im on xbox btw
---
Fuck me, these comments were cancerous.
---
beneath route 65 headed N from watoga, its a dirt tunnel but you can build down there
---
That would be awesome.
---
PS4 - SoCalKingg. They really need to fix the crashing issue on PS4. The game blue screen crashes every 1-2 hours. I own 100+ PS4 games and FO76 has crashed more than all of them combined. It’s honestly ridiculous at this point. 
---
Yup. 15 base strength and marsupial and only one deep pocket. 285 carry.  Also the excavator glitch is still working sooo technically ya can still carry damn near 500 if you have the cores.
---
I have deep pocket on all pieces of marine. I’m at 275 carry...str is 10 I think?
---
Stopping as in not regenerating or is it still draining while standing still? cause the draining while standing still after sprinting is an occasional bug that can be cleared by side steping.
---
You forget the most important step of the glitch the other people. There are two places an item can go into the world or on a player. When it’s on a player and he quits his inventory is saved not the server. So they can abuse that and crash the server once the person who is acting as a container quits and joins another server when the server crashes it rolls the two players on back to when they had the items they dropped. Now just join up with the third person and bam. Your items are duped. A temporary fix would be to have the server save when a player quit but that would get incredibly laggy. 
---
You're not making any sense... I say the devs give themselves QOL improvements and you think that saying dev rooms are in other fallout games is a retort.
---
Good, I fully recognize dev rooms being in other games and I have no problem with dev rooms being in this game. It has nothing to do at all with what I said though....
---
Don't think i have missed too many areas but even with the ghoul nerf. Whitespring is king of legendary spawns and exp while the Queen remains top for the plans and now and then she may give a good 3☆ rarely...
---
I bought this game full price. I'm only 93 that I grinded myself, best gun I have is a level 45 medical double barrel shotgun I found off a super mutant.
---
I can't do anything, literally every single server has people player killing for the fun of it and one shouting me. I have the X-01 armor, 2 pieces of ultracite power armor and they 1 shot me like it's nothing THROUGH passive mode!
---
I found out that they are duping explosive bobbleheads, stacking them to hundreds of times, they can leave and join a new server before the timer runs out (this is PS4). I was enjoying the game but now it's gotten so toxic I can farm anything I need because I'm player killed within minutes of joining a server. What's worse is that everyone has these amazing impossible to find two shot explosive guns. I'd rather a middle finger flash on the screen when I log in.
---
This only solves half the problems with learned plans.  In order to figure out if we have learnt a certain mod, it requires finding or crafting a certain weapon or armor.  Then there is the issue of scrapping weapons and armors not providing mods either due to already having all the mods already and not realizing it or the mods have a low probability of showing up.  
---
A catalog showing all craftable items and mods with the locations to obtain each mod would certainly help greatly and likely requires Bethesda to implement it.  So it would show all plans in the game, all plans we have learned, and whether a plan is from scrapping, vendors, loot drops, or lying on a table.  
---
Of course, it is far more likely that anything Bethesda implements would just list all the plans that we have currently learnt.
---
Nothing.
---
I can do that, we can meet tomorrow
---
Grognok? Is that the knock-off version of Grognak?
---
They’re broken 
---
Have one of the people who you have the stuff log out. This causes a checkpoint of the player not the server then the two that are there can crash the server and bypass the checkpoint.
---
They get caps 
---
something like "Don't have to travel across the fucking map every time".
---
The last steps of BoS were pretty good "Go through this path and end up in this zone" the paths are closer together and dont require you to fast travel 15 times.
---
Compare this to Rose's fetching marathons. (Which even did it right on some steps having rose talk to you instead of being sent to Rose yet another time).
---
Having to fight a meaningful boss, or something in these quests would help, or having a logical path between places.
---
Something that makes them not feel like literal fetch quests.
---
What you gain is worth more than any in game item. Its so rare that you cant even trade it.
---
Nothing tangible 
---
Read this thread. This is why its a problem, its turning people away from the game as soon as they get started, ruining the experience for nee players.

The dev room individual storage boxs are loot spawns all those things are spawned in that one box every in game 72 hours

They missed their opportunity huh 😔
---
Attention? Drama? Idk why these people do what they do. This is clearly bullshit just like so many other people fearmongering ridiculous stories with no proof. The fact this garbage got 600 points and front page status is really worrying for this sub
---
it isn't worth it for the amount of cap you get.
---
If ure PC you can install a card deck mod.
---
Then why don’t moderate create games of their own as big and rich as this if they are the only good part of this situation?
---
It's been a minute, but I'm not sure if I had been to Watoga at that point. I'm pretty sure just Responders and Firebreathers but idk for sure.
---
Nope you pretty much exchanged mats for his caps
---
Only 1 youtuber got banned for posting the trade glitch video
---
That's literally not proof Einstein. It's a (most likely made up) anecdotal tale you're spinning to internet strangers 
---
I laughed waaaayyy to hard at that. Now I know what I'm in for when I finish that quest though.
---
That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that its already done. I don't agree with people like you saying I should have to farm it out myself when trading is supposed to be part of the game.  We don't all have time to farm for hours upon hours to get specific weapons and armor. So are you saying that all legendary trading is bad now? Either its all okay or none of its okay. How is me wanting to trade for stuff childish?
---
No it’s not but one of the ways to get caps after the 1400 daily 
---
I wish they'd hurry up with private servers so we can run with reputable and trusted people.
---
I actually have 7500. buy as much as you would like.
---
I'll be on tomorrow night. 
---
Do they attack if you are wanted?
---
Or simply move your camp. You then place the turret out of storage and voila! No power needed.
---
Making everything vague except the result only causes panic.
---
Even if you had a shred of evidence to back this claim, it wasn't worth making.
---
Well, I have 4 in total now 
---
^^I ^^^have ^^^^no ^^^^^life
---
Sorry lad you ran into a griefer.. sorry some say they are roleplaying as *raiders*.
---
Just pricks who find it funny to go around leveling player camps. Only option is to kill them then block them then leave server so they can't follow. Then once on the new server pay the 40 caps to replace your camp down and everything should be fixed.
---
Seeing more and more of the time as time goes on. Disgusting aholes especially those that target low level players around overseer camp.
---
We do our best to hunt them down on any given server. But alass a new breed as arrived. The ones with crazy bobblehead stacks that we cannot beat. They can get through most of our player damage armor and perks regardless.
---
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
---
Some people are afraid of the potential of being banned, but I'm gonna use it anyway
---
if Bethesda bans me for using a mod that solves  a problem they should have fixed by them self 
---
then I'm done with this game anyway
---
Could the servers handle a bunch of personal pack brahmins roaming around the map?? 
---
It is a silly challenge, and even sillier because it doesn’t include the other miner gear.  Or clothing.  Or gauntlet.  Another phoned in feature.
---
Why's this guy so focused on server destabilizing thing? It is obvious duping totally destroys gameplay in general. Farming becomes meaningless, people will turn to griefing/pvping to pass their time which is absolutely broken atm. Yes , this is a pve game and bethesda don't seem to mind pvp balances that much. But duping turns this already broken mess of a game INTO a pvp game. Bet you haven't seen those dupers with thousands of bobbleheads consumed 1shot people in pacifist mode. Doesn't matter if you hit back or not he will still 1 shot you with slap damage. I guarantee all it's gonna take for you to hate on dupers is to pvp with these kind of dupers for like 5 minutes
---
Saw this on a yt video. Haven’t accepted a request since
---
&gt; Sure, I also enjoy the stories of dupers getting annihilated but allow Bethesda to handle it.
---
For every duper killed, there are hundreds of "dupers" that get their bases destroyed and hunted down.
---
Yup, what this guy said
---
Theyre identical, not sure if theres meant to be a difference or not but as far as I can see, there is none.
---
I have anti armor tambo , I know its not unarmed,but its melee
---
random question, when making and breaking items down for mods does it matter what level that stuff is? rather save my resources just making the low level stuff.
---
Ok great... Again, has no bearing on what I said whatsoever. They are just sorted lootspawns.... Because the devs wanted the loot sorted and not all crammed into a single box...
---
&gt; You could have waited for gameplay videos to get an idea of how buggy it is.
---
Or they could have waited and released in Q1 2019 instead of Q4 2018. If your best defense is "but this company always sucks!" then it's not much of a defense.
---
I highly suggest BoS combat armor,  or any of the Enclave armor. A full suit looks pretty cool. 
---
Thanks!
---
\&gt; You could have waited for gameplay videos to get an idea of how buggy it is.
---
Game is hard enough to love at times with all the hideous bugs, glitches and etc... without people shitting all over each other
---
Olivia...
---
Got a free TSE.. seems legit
---
I was making level 40 ones for a while then seemed to not get any mods for about 10 tries, switched to making level 50 ones and started getting mods again.
---
Yes so they aren't anything like our stash boxs which was your main point they gave themselves individual stash boxes for each item and can store things on shelves
---
I got a two shot explosive radium drop with I think increase to action point refresh I think as the 3rd effect in white springs last night. Haven't had a chance to try it out yet.
---
I have exactly the same kit.  All scoped, .308 is silenced. All though my lever is only 35.  It’s the only one I’ve found.  
---
out of curiosity, do u have speed demon and/or are u as console like i am? im wondering if its vanilla ps4 frame rate related, or if it doesnt stack with speed demon. 
---
That's such a cool idea
---
Console pleb here. Anyone on PC have numbers on the Gatling laser charging barrel yet?
---
Source is me... I duped for hours and hours on the same server over and over again. I never had any server stability issues. 
---
Two of my alts have over 30 million pounds of crap on them. 200k plus of every TSE out there. All logged in on the same server for hours and hours with never a problem. 
---
Bethesda is full of shit, you think they are making things better. Behind the scenes it’s getting worse. I could literally DC an entire server once every 3 mins. The new dupe method requires sever hoping, so it would be endless. 
---
It would I’ll take hardly an effort for them to fix this. 
---
Where can i find just standard mole miners? These diggers, foreman and glowing ones wont register, i must of killed 100 with a pickaxe now still nothing.
---
I'm an apologist because I've accepted the reality of this game? I'm fine with whatever Bethesda decides to do about it but until then I'm not going to let what others have done ruin my experience. If I want to buy something (with caps) I'm going to do it.
---
Hey so there are actually 7 possible faction vendors to sell to. Responders and Raiders are the big two. But there are also Whitesprings, Enclave, Free States, Brotherhood of Steel ( Watoga shopping center), and an unfactioned vendor at the Watoga Train Station. So you can get 1400 a day rather than 1000. 
---
This guy bibles.
---
Love Carnivore mutation, why would anyone think it's a bad one...
---
I would but really need unarmed thanks tho
---
I found one upstairs at sugar grove 
---
I'll tell u if I find some 
---
Again there is no proof these are causing SERVER crashes. Personal crashes yes. It cant handle the request and is booting the player. 
---
Dodgy is clutch af 
---
Mine does it about once per hour or two. It’s super annoying. 
---
 The servers are crashing on ps4 because dupers are all working like mad to do all they can before the patch Tuesday.   It's still going to be an issue wen there are characters out there with a 10000 pound inventory. 
---
Because I suck in power armor I only use it carry stuff around.
---
Alright
---
Nice, i actually dislike two shot cause its VATS accuracy is very very inconsistent. I have a two shot explosive one but like the one featured much much more.
---
Also a acronym used a lot here: TSE: two shot, explosive. ( A legendary weapon.)
---
Probably not, this isn't using any features that are openly available to us. The mod actually has to go into your player stats and figure it out, or run some kind of test to see if that mod would be useable, or something along those lines. The difference with something like the perk loadouts mod is that it doesn't provide you anything you can't do yourself; it just speeds up a process you can already do

Like Destiny rewarding you with the bright engram every level up?

It’s does affect stims and rads.
---
I think a regular turret is like 10% of your budget. So if you are using 5 that is literally half of your budget.
---
I have a TSE handmade for close engagements. But I haven't used the gauss cause I've never been a gauss fan.
---
Sick of this shit. This game has gotten so toxic. Literally everyone is running around with duped explosive bobbleheads stacked hundreds of times, and they run around and just PK everyone. On every goddamn server, when I'm not getting PK'd in disconnecting because some shithead is duping. I bought the game full price at launch, I grinded to level 91 on PS4. Best gun I have is a level 35 medics double barreled shotgun.
---
Everyone has amazing guns that should be impossible to have but maybe 1-2 people here and there, explosive bobbleheads stacked 200-300 times. When the bobbleheads are about to run out they just rejoin a new server. 
---
This game was amazing at first, but the assholes literally ruined the experience. I'm a legit player playing in a game filled with Chester's and griefers and I'm the one that suffers for buying the game at full price and thinking online would be neat 
---
They don't stack, but more pieces improve the odds. Think of each piece of armor as a coin toss, heads you're revived, tails your still dead. Each piece gives you another coin to flip. So a full set gives you 5 separate 50% chances of reviving and each success only takes 1 of those chances away for a minute. The Mysterious Savior is a separate %chance calculation based on the perk level, I'm not sure which is calculated first between the Perk and Armor effect.  
---
He does get the disdain of most reasonable people. He does get the label of selfish a$$hole. Worth it? Doubt it.
---
What does it look like?
---
My business school does not have that saying.
---
I hope you don’t have any classmates in the medical field.
---
Intresting yes i suppose so but instead of the bright engram you just get the level up screen options.
---
The raider armor with the xo helm looks pretty cool personally
---
I dunno,  i joke all the time that FO76 is the best inventory management game I've ever played. 
---
Also,  sprinting is a basic game mechanic, hard to imagine anyone not knowing you could do it.  That's why i made the comment.  It's either pure idiocy or hyberbolic.
---
It’s amazing. I hesitated fo so long tying to decide whether to get carnivore or herbivore, but I’m glad I went with carnivore. I haven’t gone hungry at all since getting it.
---
Autobits, roll out!
---
What new players? :P
---
Ya... I know they aren't anything like our shitty stash boxes... they are like the storage we would love to have...
---
Again I really REALLY doubt it, mainly because the server should be able to handle a whole team leaving at once (because friends play together and would leave at the same time)   
---
3 people is 1/8 of server population, on a small server shouldn't disconnect anyone else. 
---
My GT was changed a few days ago but my user name is still there as proof

I mean, I get that. I have never played rust but i get what you are saying. Still, it seems like an odd choice to make so far into the game’s release and without it being in the patch notes? Not like there hasn’t been information missing before but that seems like an important thing to mention to players if it’s going to be changed.
---
It was always like that, clickbait whores left and right.
---
GTA 6, they put a modded version of GTA V in the news and milk it like there is no tomorrow.
---
Or Cyberpunk 2077 recycelt old news.
---
Now they milk Fallout 76, and hate BGS like its the devil and all the great games they released before not even matter.
---
What a bunch of no lifers.
---
When it comes to gaming news youtubers are just the worst media. 
---
It is crash locally not globally, the request to the server is most likely rejected for YOU and kicks YOU (possibly teammates but I have only been kicked myself.) 
---
No need bud you can swap perk cards around any time. We are pretty much jack of all trades with no downsides.
---
If you use perk manager on pc.
---
》 Camp build ( crafting , modding, food etc).
---
》 Melee build 
---
》 Range build
---
》 Harvesting build
---
Etc etc and you can just swap through them via holding shift and hitting 1,2,3,4 so on.
---
But they aren't they are basically the lock box or foot locker you find on the ground in a building not like the one you build
---
I havent called a supply drop once. It's not needed after you get a water purifier.
---
They have said the team is aware of the request but I would love this as well. 
---
Your business school doesn’t teach lean startup in its entrepreneurship degrees? 
---
Finally a quality post. Seems like every other post is "Can we take a minute to thank x for their hard work? I need karma z".
---
Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all ^nothing at all ^^nothing at all
---
 It's Longfellow's coat,  from Fallout 4
---
Yeah stopping regenerating, I've also had the latter bug but that's different.
---
My first thought was that having many mutations might have something to do with it or that it's servers struggling to keep up
---
any time I get knocked of a server lately off its not long after nuking has happened and a bunch of people head to that area, when I get to check out the map when it starts lagging as I get the server not responding notification.
---
Yeah I have and all I really see is someone having a single unfortunate incident.
---
I've had my CAMP attacked several times by higher level players starting out.
---
Remove the whole witch hunt concept from this situation.
---
A group of high level players are going around attacking a noob. 
---
Dickish, sure, but it's within their right in the game to do so regardless if they're doing it for a reason or to troll.
---
Getting fairly killed in a game where you're able to be killed is to be expected regardless of motive. If this one event is enough to turn them away from the game then by all means the game probably isn't there style. Which is totally fine. 
---
I know some people here are probably going to call you a duper for sympathizing with the people on the receiving end. I don't. Either way, I just don't see this as some massive epidemic. Players going around killing other players and being dicks. What else is new? It's hardly a reason for a call to action.
---
You're not going to stop the witch hunts by avenging people. And the hunters sure as hell aren't going to go and put a halt to duping. It's amusing tho.
---
Maybe they shouldn't be filled with shit then?
---
Are you on PC? 
---
The only way I have ever found to fix this is to delete the entire base...go to a new world and rebuild a base. It seems to somehow get stuck and just won't reduce the used amount of workshop space no matter how much you get rid of unless you start over from scratch. Have read in other places it may have to do with decorations but not sure on that.
---
I doubt its mutations, I have like 14.
---
You cant have both simultaneously
---
No, but I probably haven’t taken enough chems. 😉
---
Thanks for sharing
---
It's only really a fetch quest on the surface though, the real gold is what you learn as you go along. I don't know, i just don't agree with your description of it. Ireally loved the quest and to me it made perfect sense that the Order of Mysteries have agents spread around the wasteland making the quests spread out. 
---
I don't mind fast travelling too much, partly because of how many indoor areas have been made 'load-free' and you can seemlessly enter. Besides i don't always fast travel and i very, very rarely focus down a quest from start to finish without taking breaks to do other stuff. 
---
There are so many quests that take you around the wasteland i like to keep a few active so when they happen near each other i can finish up doing one thing, and then pick back up on another quest nearby and actually physically walk there, fast travelling all the time takes a lot of the cool and random experiences out of the game. 
---
While you were buying that jetpack torso there was a dude in stealth boy PA in the corner with his sights on you
---
I hope it’s a glitch. The supply drops still can encourage pvp because it is a place where characters, and most likely low levels, will gather. I don’t think it should be first come first serve, but I guess we should keep an eye out if that’s the case now. I have 60+ of those damn holotapes I was holding onto to help out beginners. Would be a shame if they all had to fight over it. I mean, yeah, it’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but there can at least be enough canned dog food for several players to get their fill.
---
I got most of mine from the firebases in the the bog. I have seen them in the wild otherwise but normally it is zeta invaders or wastelad. 
---
Would be nice to have a boss death claw. 
---
The server tracks UNIQUE items. Non-unique just get a number. 
---
Not until the player killing is fixed.
---
PS4 is every single server, literally everyone has TSE guns and have duped explosive bobbleheads and stacked them 400-500 times and one shot everyone in passive mode and then teabag you.
---
Meanwhile the few of us that play legit are shit on constantly. Outside of that, I'm disconnected within 15-20 minutes because some shitheads are duping.
---
The bugs I don't mind, it's the assholes cheating and nothing is happening to them and player killing is what makes me regret buying a 60 dollar beta game.
---
Why do you think it's clearly bullshit? Seems reasonable to not show proof so as to not spread the knowledge of how to do it.
---
I often thought it would be nice to be able to zoom in on a note like you can with map's
---
This isn't 'three people leaving' though, this is three (or however) many people being force disconnected by the server.  That's why all of these duping methods involved rapidly crafting items and then waiting to be booted, rather than simply logging out or hitting ALT+F4.
---
Touche.
---
I usually see them at one of the two grafton vendors 
---
Tried again today. Still fails on step one (find the gathering place) every single time. My friends report that they've done it several times, so maybe some accounts are bugged permanently? This other guy we play with has a permanent issue where every time he fast travels or loads into a game, he has to manually re-share his perk card.
---
Buy some stock in bandaids, boys. Bethesda's patching some code!
---
I get them all the time, as I fit your profile.  I enjoy the cat and mouse game.
---
I haven’t checked one out in so long. It is at least stuff low levels characters might care about?
---
Goat legs and Acrobats (-50% Fall damage Armor) are added differently. Goat Legs does as stated in the perk, 40%/80% reduction of fall damage. The armor on its own behaves the same as FO4 Acrobat's Legs 2 pieces, leg's only, will negate all fall damage. Combining them is handled differently, ones is applied to the fall damage before the other giving 1 armor piece + max goat legs a 90% reduction. 
---
Given that the legendary effects are handled the same as FO4 it seems that -Fall Damage items other than legs have no effect. 
---
Constantly disconnects on PS4 because ppl are duping. When I'm on a server longer than 15 minutes, assholes are running around with TSE weapons and 400-500 stacked explosive bobbleheads and one shouting everyone in passive mode.
---
100% over-encumbered? Can't drop/trade/sell/place in container; and can't move character until they "Destroy \[item(s)\]" to become below the 100% over-encumbered status. That would significantly limit dupers' abilities to do anything... or at the least make it extremely tedious. FFS, there are options here... if you can't fix your code Bethesda due to server limitations, just add new restrictions that make it painful enough for duping to stop 99% of dupers from doing so because the hassle is no longer worth the reward... 
---
Easy fix to this give each stack a unique I’d as well as a character Id. When you collect an item and a stack is created it’s assigned a unique id the stack also receives your unique player Id when an item from a stack is dropped  it keeps its unique if but loses the player id. So when another player picks it up it gains that players unique is. And if they have a stack the item is now added to that and it’s unique Id is added to the list of items. Now after a certain amount of time the unique I’d will change to become just one this is to stop people from getting lists of like 300-400 unique id s a stack. How would this help? Say you have your friend an item to dupe and when you get back he drops it to you when you pick it up the player if changes and what’s that’s you have 2 stacks with the same id so what happens the smaller stack gets erased from your inventory. Now here’s where it gets confusing. How would trading work. I’d make it when you trade an item the unique I’d is lost as well as the player I’d do that it joins the stacks. Then when the trade is done save both players inventory so they can’t crash the server. Sorry for the bad format on a phone :/
---
Sure what platform
---
If ur on ps4 im down
---
Literally everyone has one except me. And those shithead Chester's that do have duped 400-500 explosive bobbleheads and stacked them. When they are about to run out those assholes join a new server and it resets the timer so they can keep one shouting passive players.
---
You’re the only one claiming that the mechanic is “broken.” I’d say it’s working as they intended otherwise your character would have a weight limit just like the stash does.
---
If I’m PS4 I’m down 
---
Kiloton radium rifle in FO4 was unquestionably the best gun in the game if you built around it.
---
Vendor caps are instanced to the player. There's 7 different vendor groups, allowing for 1400 caps per day (on each character) from them.
---
Xb1 sorry guys i edited it
---
/r/kokoromi, why have you forsaken me,
---
Sent a request.
---
It's strong but the ammo weighs a fair bit unless you've batteries included equipped. 
---
Only if you are starved for ammo, food, water, and radaway. So not even imo.
---
I just wanted to say thank you for this. I know the post is over a month old, but I just recently started caring where my camp is and what it is doing for me. Thanks a lot. 
---
Alright. It's on the list now, thanks mate :)
---
Honestly doesn't sound like a bad thing, they never had much loot anyway, and I always found it odd everyone got loot so there was no rush or risk involved to get them. However I do think it would be better if it wouldn't want you for picking it.
---
PS4 they don't need to provoke you. They can just 1 shot you through passive. They are stacking duped explosive bobbleheads 400-500 times. Literally every server. I am hating the experience on an otherwise fun game now because if it. And us legit players basically get shit on because we aren't cheating.
---
It still doesn't work unfortunately
---
When I was growing up, I looked at North Korea as some kind of aberration - the idea that some small nation, oppressed by its own dictator, could only project their failures onto the world around them, seemed ridiculous, and especially impossible in the western world
---
Thanks for repeatedly proving me wrong, r/fo76
---
So many challenges don’t work.  Beta.
---
Its pretty clear he means letting people know what the dupe method is so Bethesda can address which as a consequence would mean more people would have to deal with the server disconnect.
---
In your eyes forsaken me  
---
In your thoughts forsaken me  
---
In your heart forsaken, me oh  
---
Trust in my self righteous suicide  
---
I, cry, when angels deserve to die

In my self righteous suicide  
---
I, cry, when angels deserve to die

Power armor works different iirc as items like those have a higher value so you can bypass the limit easy so when you make a request to scrap the server can’t handle it and crashes. At least that was my findings from testing even so it still works now and you can still dupe using that very method 
---
I uze the draw and it works for me sooo not too sure.
---
Dislike. So what if two or three players get a free purified water, pre-war money and maybe a stimpak? Seeing as how most people avoid the events, this is just about the only time I ever get to even see other players. And adds marginally to the grind, which is what every patch adds.
---
All my buddies have commented something like that. I got the RobCo hat and the Red Rocket pip boy paint so that it all matches my medic jumpsuit. Since I role-play as a wasteland medic. 
---
This is what you signed up for
---
Idk with the way the game runs right now probably not haha.
---
&gt; "join back to previous server"
---
SBQ is dying in 30 seconds these days. Wouldn't help.
---
Hey! It wasn't me by any chance was it? That sounds scarily similar to an experience I had with a lower level player earlier! We were guiding a robot around in the event "Back on the beat" :) 
---
Batheseda doesn't care. 
---
Hmm, well maybe they should make some for higher levels players with more sought after supplies (maybe even a legendary item) and have those be locked and a one time only thing. Promote pvp amongst those that can better defend themselves, or something of the likes,
---
But keep the other supply drops the way they were.
---
I have an explosive tesla, its a shit weapon, but I got it at level 40, had to wait til I got to 45 to use it.  Explosive weapons happen folks, now get out there and farm yourself some legendaries.
---
my lawyer charges $100 to look over any eula I fax to him and read it back to me in laymans terms. id rather just play the game
---
Vendor cap limits are player-based (in a sense already instanced to you), and vendors refill caps at a 1:2 ratio, so you need to sell 400 caps worth of stuff to get back to 200. I don't know if you just don't know about vendor faction or what, but you can basically make ~1000 caps per 24 HR period, when they reset (at 10EST?) By hopping to a vendor of each faction.
---
Hope this helps.
---
You're forgetting about all those fake internet points you can use to feel like you've achieved something. :\^)
---
What are you trying to show me?
---
I understand that but as per my edit I am on PC which already has said patch and I've heard many others with this issue aswell
---
You really don’t know there is a new dupe method ? Servers are crashing every 40 mins to an hour. 
---
&gt;It is at least stuff low levels characters might care about?
---
Not really, no.
---
I was disconnected 3 times in an hour. I just came back to the game after stopping at the end of December due to the issues going on then, I was hoping with the recent patch the game would be more stable.  Guess I picked a bad day to give it a second shot.
---
Interesting bug. The options for higher level weapons are greyed out. The options for lower level weapons were standard text. In any case, logging out and in a few times fixed the bug. Thank you.
---
Aquaboy perk is worth 1 endurance slot lol 
---
Yes, I definitely triple checked to make sure I had enough materials. Logging out and in a few times fixed the bug. Thank you. 
---
All my ballistic ammo weighs nada 
---
I wouldn’t bother with goat legs once you have 2 acrobat armor pieces, just a waste of perk points
---
Stand Fast has the Chameleon legendary effect as it was called in FO4, it is separate from the shadowed mod, and they do stack.
---
I got about eighty supply drop tapes so if any body needs equipment, I got you.
---
 P.s I didn't dupe I just never use them
---
well shit...
---
Yep.  Same here.  I wonder if it's just the huge inventories some folks have.  Plus,  word is that there's yet another dupe glitch being passed around.  
---
Gamer tag?
---
I started dropping stuff in the Watoga staition suitcase and the garbage bin outside of vendor bot Phoenix’s shop
---
I’m afraid I have to vote No on Proposition No Go.  The current system means you can just keep relogging until you find a free server which works fine for solo players.  
---
At the cost of some time I know.
---
However if an auto decline system was implemented that would make logging into a friend’s world or logging in has a team an utter nightmare.  I count myself lucky if two out of our four CAMPS can exist in the same world.
---
True. I'm just giving them a hard time lol
---
Same as my reddit name
---
Duping is duping, and it is bad. It is the equivalent of committing fraud or robbing a bank. Yes, I know it is a game, but these are people that would rather steal from others than get out and work a job and live a satisfying life. Only good thing to do with people like that is remove them from the equation, in game, and irl. Punishment doesn't work, it just makes them figure out another way and hopefully not get caught. They should be IP banned. 
---
Lol fair enough
---
Yes. Right now none of my weapons do any damage at all. I’m maxed in shotguns and rifleman. No damage registered at all. Just started today. Can’t even fight a mole rat. Quit and restarted. Logged back in. Doesn’t matter. Character is completely broken. 
---
Any ideas what is could be? People said there were alians in this game
---
That I wasnt lying, this guy gave it to me. Your comment made you found skeptical of me getting it for free. There is proof I got it for free and that the reason he gave it to me was to free up weight.
---
I uninstalled the fucking thing two weeks ago and I haven’t looked back. 
---
You are a goddamn saint, thank you so much.
---
I will do this continuously if someone has their water purifiers locked... 
---
Ill becon in 20- 30 if you still need help then
---
Ok, I laughed, it's like you took the ring to throw it in the lava...I wonder if someone stumbled across it
---
It's an alien thing I've killed one before
---
Same is happening to me do you know how to get rid of it 
---
Happened to me tonight.  CTD nuked whitesprings, spawned up at the railyard.
---
Why is XP going away?
---
If you on Xbox. I have both.
---
It's the flatwoods monster. And yes it is an alien
---
That would probably be the flatwoods monster
---
Yea i killed one before but never seen it teleport away
---
I saw this today I was wondering why there was three of them hanging out and then everything crashed
---
Rad.
---
i dont recall any aliens but i could be wrong. only thing that really makes sense, since theres holotapes in Appalachia claiming they were there they day the nukes launched. 
---
Thanks!!
---
So.Post.Proof.  the servers crashing isn't proof of duping. Show me fuck show this entire sub Reddit the first proof of duping after the latest patch and show all of us that it causes the server to crash not just for the duper but but for the entire instance. Then further amaze our collective nuts off by demonstrating how this cause items to multiply like rabbits fucking.
---
Put up or shut the fuck up 
---
I’ve actually seen that aswell. It’s in the shape of a person has those same purple eyes but was in like a robe or long coat type of a thing it was by my house in the woods.  
---
When I first saw it I was like oh, okay then. 
---
The Charleston junkyard has two hanging ready to be utilized. 
---
Just got to level 100 today. I've been on since BETA day 1. I don't exploit, farm,  or use glitches.  I just work my ass off. Events are big for xp, well rested helps,  and team cards also give great bonuses.  So,  you're wrong. 
---
No way, I’m 100% over all the freaking time if not more. With speed serum you can still move pretty good. 
---
I fought 1 by a nuke silo but never seen it leave
---
Agreed.  I also played WoW during the open beta and release day was still more stable than fo76 is now.
---
Damn 
---
Did you loot it ? What’s it called if you did by any chance 
---
I have a friend who is level 460+
---
I wish there was a site or app that would tell us what's in the atomic store. 
---
The one I got teleported away from me but towards my wife so we still killed it.
---
I’m down. When are you fighting it?
---
It might be. Hopefully we hear back from bethesda asap. To my knowledge they havnt addressed this issue at all
---
If you fast travel to Harper's Ferry and face the town you'll see a building with a hole in the wall just to the left of the red cargo container/gate. This building has several broken display cases in it that spawn plans for armor and cooking recipes. The upper floors are accessed thru the broken train car laying on the building once you get into the town. I've gotten trapper, marine, and sturdy/heavy combat armor plans from in here.
---
The trade without consent referred to the trade menu opening without you accepting to trade with someone. It was a simple bug and not anywhere near as malicious as you're interpreting it out to be.
---
The myth involving stealing people's items through the trade menu never existed hence why every youtuber tried to replicate it without any results and the people posting about the "glitch" never showed any proof let alone any consistency between each claim. If you genuinely believe it was real then tell me what was the method of the exploit? Answer. You don't know because it didn't exist.
---
Flatwoods mounster i believe. Never fought this one in the video obviously 
---
Me tooooo
---
Dupers ruin Queen Spawn events, by one shotting them.
---
This is the reason why dupers ruin the server.
---
Comment to find later as also curious
---
Bout 20-30mins
---
Pumping out 22k dmg on my hand made. This should be fixed soon, as it’s the only bobble head that stacks I tried them all. 
---
Flatwoods has a couple radstag carcasses and a few Brahmin. 
---
Ok cool. Just joined ur game
---
He’s really trying to keep complaining about 76 because it got him a whole bunch of views the first time. Now it seems like if a Bethesda staff member farts he’ll make a video about how Bethesda developers have farted in our general direction as a show of strength.
---
I think it'll all iron out.  No Man's Sky took a long time to get its shit together,  and there are plenty folks still playing that game.  I just hope Bethesda is going to put the effort in to fix the issues. 
---
I recommend to them going through the game again and taking time to read notes and terminals, that’s what I did once I got bored of my main character. A lot the writing is actually pretty good. 
---
Unfortunately VATS is still a bit messed up, with some types of weapons (mainly 2 shot) it's seems to show high percentage of accuracy but still miss alot of the time. Instigating is great however with pve. I got an instigating explosive pipe bolt and in VATS it doesn't miss and it 1 shots anything but scorchbeasts.
---
Yongyea is one of the shittier "journalists" with a big following. Everything he posts is aimed to stir up drama and is biased to get more negativity so he can get views. He often makes no research beforehand or dismisses it on purpose. 
---
+karma for a great discussion
---
So would a explosive weapon with no 2 shot be better?
---
&gt; There are 4 power armor spawns in watoga. 
---
Seven.
---
My favourite part of this is the “hero” gets killed and continues to act like he’s in control 
---
In Whitesprings, you sometimes can find radstag near the club house toward the stream. If you’re lucky, it’ll be legendary. 
---
Gamertag?

Never seen it happen. Maybe you're doing something to piss people off?

Damn champion bot, have I truly reached the limit of your NPC programming?
---
When you gave up all pretenses of actually wanting an honest debate I expected a witty back and forth exchange.
---
But you’ve never even attempted to pick apart my argument, even with bullshit. Instead you ignored it from the get go. And now you won’t try to be creative and insult me back with anything new.
---
Did your programming daddy not give you enough attention.
---
Then go tell support,dumbass.

I have known a lot of dupers , I do not condone it, but I do know all the tricks and signs. Between 4 of us we have liberated 3.8 million carry in guns, armor, aid ,and junk now.  I will not go into details as  to how we are making it so these dupers are losing everything or near everything but to say the least we have removed 13 from the xbox where they would need to start from scratch. We are talking they lost all their guns, armor,aid, junk and a dupe dc ain't getting them back. I will not name names though I have a list, I will not report them, as this really is Bethesda's fault they could have stopped this shit back on the December 11th patch but they didn't hell they basically spit in the wound and didn't even bandage it.  However I will play this game how I want and I want to hunt them and take their shit as I have many times now.  (My main I play as a raider so I do asshole raider things, RP is important)   
---
Have i hit a single innocent person...no not one because we have common sense and know what to look for. These people out hunting for the sake of fucking with people is dumb and I am sorry.   
---
Also for today I have ran into only 1 duper, Friday there were a lot Saturday there were some but the trend has them moving away from duping now. They are scared now and being smarter. So people quit hunting it is over duping groups have taken a huge it and the two big groups I know about have stopped in fear of being banned since the PC patch hit or killed from the expo monsters losing at least all their junk. (which is now another problem and I hope it gets fixed it is way way way worse than the economy being degraded)  
---
So to the ones reading this and want to hunt unless you actively see them drop something move back to a bench hover over the bag for a few seconds and the bag then goes away and they head to a world container odds are they are not duping. No duper will be in a house that is walled off either.  
---
I tried to explain all this once in a post but it was labeled witch hunting so the message didn't properly get out.   
---
That's pretty interesting.
---
Conversely, maybe it's the reason the monsters in that state it is in the first place.

---
Nope, based on what everyone was able to data-mine. The mod/plans for it do not exist in the game sadly.
---
True. They all claimed server crash, but who knows. Just my theory on how and why 3 ppl would be needed.
---
I have no doubt about bethesda putting in the effort hopefully. I just hope the community will last and it doesnt take all too long
---
LOL.
---
Some of the selfies I took will have to suffice. 
---
And I don't have the right app to be able to post them here. Sorry. 
---
That could be possible maybe someone was almost pitching an idea to others and they ended up with what we see now
---
:-)
---
It would have to be really really worth it compared to other farming methods that are just pve.
---
people have 2 X1 shocks right? first week i played i server hopped a few hours, got a jetpack and 1 shock. Probably seen 7-8 jet packs now, never seen another shock.
---
i'd settle for a VATS+Mutated Western Revolver+Lever action, not a fan of cookie cutter but also know where my strengths are (very bad skin damage atm so cant use mouse alot so dependant on vats) and getting non-cookie cutter weapons are actually harder it seems :/
---
Supplying the common wealth with the ability to poop anywhere, what a legend.
---
And after you kill this creature not realising it was tamed you become wanted
---
Client inventories need to be real time updated to the server, not cached. Check out a magazine of ammo at a time and make the rest real time. 
---
grinding for rare plans so i can craft things. nukes are boring
---
Blame duping tbh.
---
That gun that you casually traded for a flipped should be incredibly rare.
---
They traded for 20-25k at launch
---
Brahmin carry weight based off of charisma. Upped with perks, and buffed with Brahmin snacks!

---
For VATS, then yes. Maybe wait to see what other people say, 2shot might not get the accuracy bug when using a critical, but you still need to build critical beforehand. What type of weapon you favour? What platform?
---
registrator2000 has a very good reputation modding Fallout 4 and now 76. His reputation isn't a problem, but I'm still going to wait before I jump into .dll mods for 76. 
---
To charge the Gauss for maximum damage it is. Test it yourself
---
This has been around since beta
---
Ps4, and in thinking about using a gauss 
---
Well thank you very much anyway!  :)
---
You can but you aren’t doing full damage. You have to charge it to do full damage 
---
I meant getting above 100 in B.E.T.A
---
He's asking 'for a friend' from the looks of it, trying to likely get the 'how to' on it
---
I'm also not a fan of the cookie cutter stuff, its about half the reason why i made the post at all, two shot is overrated and there's viable alternatives. Explosive is uncontested best for the second legendary effect though other than some specific guns that behave oddly when explosive.
---
I’m pretty sure I have one. If so I’d swap for a left arm plan. 
---
GT wonderpuddle25 
---
Just make it so it only spawns you at the mat, and uses the current system for any teammates traveling to your base.
---
This is so sad.😢 
---
I wish the value of god tier weapons was still insanely high and that the market wasnt flooded. 
---
It would just add that missing touch of value to rare weapons.
---
If you pick it, is it still locked for other players?
---
I don't have anything locked. Junk collector, purifiers, plants, stations, doors, all unlocked. I even have friendly signs pointing my direction for any players nearby (located next to pleasant valley station)
---
You're giving BGS too much credit. We can't even make a team base. Making permanent alliances or organizations is waaaayyy down the road, if at all.
---
I running a vats rifle build that I'm finalizing. Got a tse handmade for sqb (prime) but my main gun is a level 40 exploding pipe bolt action rifle/pistol.
---
Its very satisfying as i get close to none stop crits.
---
I do start with some stealth but the speed of dropping multple targets with 1 shot is the bread and butter.
---
Avoid 2 shot though, they miss alot in vats.
---
Flat woods monster 
---
No, but I’ve been disconnected from the server while lying on a bed. My body disappeared, so I was just a sleeping head. 
---
Naw those expo monsters are everywhere now, it is a plague upon the game.  Been watching SBQs getting one shotted by these people. But being able to kill the pacifists is the worst.  I rather have the dupers then these cancerous fucks. 
---
So I should stick with just a explosive weapon with other useful effects?
---
Deep pocketed marine 335 carry weight wit marsupial 
---
same idea

---
Yeah i myself gave up for today after like 8 hours straight. Energy and time is running out. Aside from that i was already starving in game and had no food on me no more. Only 2-3 bottles of  water either. So yeah... gonna go to sleep, then to the doc for my new painkillers and then probably try again.
---
Maybe I should have said, never seen it happen on ps4
---
I'm aware, its dps will still beat a HR regardless.
---
Idk man, i traded for a Two-shot explosive harpoon a while back and its been the most fun weapon yet. I might not have had the excitement of finding it but i'm just thrilled I was able to get it. With the way drops are in 76 I farmed so many Whitespring nukes and never even seen a legendary harpoon launcher and only a few explosive weapons after a thousand or so legendary drops.
---
If your on pc the modders gave us the ability to create clans. It's really well dones and you can have ranks and all. Then just choose your clan outfit that you agree on using. :)
---
I have one.  Trade for Left arm.  I’m on now
---
A special Red Rocket cash register would be cool with the vendor update. 
---
Just remember their name, leave your base destroyed and fast travel away. Watch to see if they travel back to their base, call me so I can wreck that shit because too many caps and level 235 with nothing better to do 😭
---
I just found one myself. Curious if it is the same. Actually I'm not sure, haven't tried it yet, but I found a way to consistently crash and I keep losing the last minute or so of progress when I do. So I'm assuming it may work in the same fashion as previous duping strategies.
---
Found this out the hard way there other night. Kinda wish there was any warning at all about that.
---
I'm with you on that. It definitely doesnt have the same satisfaction. I'm over the hype of the tse to be honest. I got my eyes set on a two shot lever action with no explosion damage. Eventually I will find one. It also gives me something to look forward too.
---
Felt pretty good when I found my bloody explosive gatling. After that it was all down hill, trading and getting most end game weapons with ease.
---
I think of my character as one of the Vault-Tec security guys that had to put up with 25 years of "America's Best and Brightest". With nothing but re-watching my collection of action movies to keep myself from opening the weapons locker and purging the vault. Now out in Appalachia, trusty shotgun in hand, I've got a near endless supply of stress relief targets. 
---
Side note: To the mid-40's player in a Whitesprings nuke zone the other night when i didn't realize i was in area chat and walked into one of the houses calling "Knock Knock, Anybody Home?" as i shotgunned anything glowing inside. Hope i didn't freak you out too badly and will admit whiskey, ingame and IRL, came into play.
---
Bethesda has known this one since the end of BETA. I already explained last week there was one more that I was hoping would be patched as it was way worse. I have sent two tickets walking them through the steps to do it. But it seems they missed it this patch cycle so it will be two extra weeks minimum of shit unless they got it in for the console patch coming up. That just leaves PC fucked then. 
---
Or you could just repair the base with the CAMP machine because it actually doesn't cost a massive amount of resources to do so? It's rather cheap
---
No the one I found doesn’t require doing any of that nonsense with servers
---
My grandfather used to buy trucks with no AC until the mid 90s. He just said they weren't necessary. He was mad when he couldn't get a truck without AC anymore. It always tripped me out, but I didn't complain, I prefer driving with the windows down, except when it's raining. 
---
What's your perk setup?
---
Pretty much. Watch out for crits do more damage affixes, that jacks up the ap cost of the shot.
---
I could see instigating explosive w/ vats fills faster being a goal.  That's what I'm aiming for but I'm a bit torn on the type of gun.
---
Bolt action pipe pistols with a stock benefit from gunslinger and riflemen perks but it's slower firing
---
No the gun. It’s obviously duped. Of course someone would give away a TSE when there’s millions from dupers. 
---
&gt; and an unfactioned vendor at the Watoga Train Station
---
No shit, really? I knew about the others. Isn't Grahm his own as well (if you can find him)?
---
The game should have probably released after a long period of beta testing and more development in that time. A lot of these problems shouldn't have gone live. I personally find value in a lot of items and want to collect all kinds of weapons and armor sets but the game doesn't want to let me do that so I'm forced to see some items as worthless good for nothing but selling to a vendor for some measly amount or dropping in the trash.
---
So people Magically found a new dupe method instantly?
---
I think some worry that if 76 is even slightly successful, that Bethesda will fail to correct its course, that DLC will be more of the same, or that mistakes will be repeated in FO5 or ES6, or that even continuing to put resources into 76's development will take away from those games. Or they're under the delusion that Betheda pays people to say positive things here.
---
Yeah same here. Ive farmed nukesprings many many times and only have one explosive and a handful of twoshots to show for it. But, I still use those weapons and have pride in the fact that I found them. And ngl that harpoon gun sounds dank lol just the thought of an explosive harpoon gun.
---
There's no question that the game has been crashing ***a lot more*** lately with more server disconnects.   If a new dupe method is not causing it, then what is?   
---
Could be, or he had an extra that no one wanted to buy and he needed some stash space for other things. Could go either way.
---
Incorrect.  They leveled the base.  It would have cost me an insane amount of materials to do so with the repair all feature.
---
Moving the base a few feet resolved the issue but tripled my build.  I was at 261% of maximum budget after the fact.
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
Just wanted to help you get a *head* start on the next patch. 
---
I have noticed that when I log on (PS4) that my power helmet is in my inventory if i'm wearing power armor, and my hat is removed if i'm not. 
---
This is slightly bothersome if it turns out that I'm immediately being attacked when I become active. 
---
Additionally, if i'm not in power armor, and I equip any hat, my head immediately turns invisible. It doesn't go away when I move or change hats. 
---
Possibly related: I am wearing one piece of chameleon armor and 1 piece of shrouded armor. I also have a very low charisma, so maybe the game is helping me compensate for my ugliness. 
---
Still, I like my character's face, and would like for others to be able to see it. 
---
Thanks. 
---
I'm with you, I'd rather earn than buy. The only exception is serums, which are stupidly expensive and other players can sell them. I found a serum maker who wanted the materials first, which made me feel less cheap for buying from them. 
---
I've been completely ignoring TSEs, and at this point if I managed to actually find one I'd probably sell it. Just feels cheap. 
---
I've noticed that as you keep playing, the plans and mods even out to the point where you're only keeping an eye out for rare things you know you've never seen. I've been keeping a pen and paper list of what I have, and it's a short, almost useless list now. It's saved me 200-300 caps, tops. 
---
A mod that shows absolutely everything (eliminating chance and exploration) would suck a lot of fun out of the game. At your own risk, I guess. 
---
Exactly. On ps4, everyone accuses me of cheating because of my full set of sentinel plus 4 pieces of assassins. It basically makes me take no damage when I stand still, but people say I 'spam bobble heads' when their duped shotgun doesn't 1 tap me
---
Please sweet Jesus let us use this mod with no backlash
---
Crafting is weird. With just 5 int you can do everything. 
---
Higher int will get you more extra durability on the craft but there's a 3* perk that lets you repair to 200% anyways.
---
High int and that perk pushes it higher.
---
Imo specializing is overkill. 
---
When you're out fighting you won't need the perks besides gunsmith for the gun degradation bonus.  
---
If you have high int you can get demo expert for exploding weapons but they are so stupidly strong already.
---
There are always a fwe radstags just south of Vault 76. There are a couple of lootable corpses at Darling Sisters Lab, also in the forest. 
---
I tend to see Radstags in the Toxic Valley quite a bit, near the Dried Toxic Lakebed. 
---
In the pictures in the atomic shop, there were metal doors. I looked at this item, and even remember taking note
---
Maybe it's a PS4 thing. Nothing but lovely people on PC for the most part. 
---
They work for me on PC, but it would be nice if the weapon one worked a little more often than it does now. Feels like it used to be better. LK = 9, card is a 3, once every couple of days my weapon(s) will break and need manual repair (unless I use my gatling plasma, then it's every time I use the friggin' thing).
---
cards that you use for crafting things in your camp are not part of builds. you swap them in when you craft.
---
Personally I dont see the greatness behind two shot weapons. Wouldnt they theoretically be more inaccurate? If I could have a weapon id like to find it would be an explosive-quad-reduced weight lever action.
---
Sounds like we need hunters for the hunters
---
[Here's what I run.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3636f8&amp;d=s92sf2ss2se2sb2p02ej4c71eu0ib4i10ad2am2ap2ak2al2l71lu2lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=Deathclaw%20Gunslinger)
---
Nope.
---
I was under the impression we were agreeing that the cash registers were where we were stuffing everything at train stations. If you're on PC, always check there. Exception: Since Whitespring doesn't have a register, check the sack beside the Tinker's bench.
---
If a nuke drop makes the server crash then imagine a event like this....
---
Easy everyone justifiably believes that the game sucks so they justifiably believe this is true and they justifiably want bethesda to ~~fix this~~ quit the multiplayer biz, hand out refunds, and retool the assets into a single player game with optional coop and no mtx.
---
I can't think of a downside to allowing people to choose the fast travel destination. I assume it was removed for a reason.  Workshops are fixed, known, tested locations.. Camps aren't.  Maybe Bethesda didn't want people creating the kind of issue you're talking about deliberately, creating traps with falls and radiation? 
---
They should have a feature that flags habitual pvp'ers etc and sticks them in their own servers, like GTA and the dunce hat.
---
How does he do that without being 7500% over camp budget?
---
Odd how a legendary weapon or armor is as valuable as a bag of green blood...
---
I think we are playing on different levels here. I’m talking about end game legendary guns. Not your basic run of the mill stock guns.
---
Even then you can 1 shot level 68 super mutants, scorched, etc with a headshot with a .50 hunting rifle.
---
Bottom line, if you account the charge time for the Gauss, the hunting rifle is on par for single target and better against mobs. A lot of people look at raw damage and that’s it. Fire rate is more important when we start really jacking damage up. 
---
It underperforms because most people that play this game don’t really know how to play it. 
---
Heh!
---
I got everything working late last night or early this morning, lol! Finally got it to let me make that right power armor leg so now it's complete. Thanks for the info on the mod, I'll be looking out for it, I got caps to burn!
---
One of them has highlighted textures on the butt, i forget which one, but if you but them both on and look real hard youll see
---
Mostly, unless you are falling from height 
---
That's really odd, since a *lot* of quest related items don't spawn until the associated part of the quest is active. 
---
“iM rOlEpLaYiNg As rAiDeR” - Fully clad in X01/Ultracite/Anything but something raiderlike.
---
White Knight is in Agi though ;)
---
The perk that does the same to PA's is in Int though ;)
---
It only came to PC on 1/10. 
---
Anyone how how much armor penetration the piercing rounds do? The perception perk doesnt actually show any change, while it does show change for the legendary modifier and the perk modifiers
---
Why not run another character with a different play style, or even challenge yourself to use certain weapons only or no power armor as a few examples. Spice it up for yourself. :)
---
I have a legendary marine leg that weighs 0. 
---
Bragging about code in a game lmao
---
If everything is special, nothing is special. That kind of problem.
---
It's going to take some time for the problem to be fixed, if at all. 
---
Right now, don't have a lot of confidence in Bethesda staying on top of the issue. They're starting to push back though and it's early days. We'll have to see.
---
I thought it does.
---
Close engagements? 
---
I have a single shot Nocturnal Explosive handmade that is my regular weapon but I cannot use it with enemies that are closer than about 30 feet because I will kill myself from the explosive damage.
---
If I found a TSE I would defo sell it unless it was some sort of heavy weapon because the two shot affect goes hand in hand with a minigun or something of that type. But id rather a non two shot explosive weapon. Idk why just preferences I guess
---
They expire after some time.  You get a self destruct notice on your screen (easy to miss) then they poof.  
---
For the weapon magazine mods I've read somewhere around 30%, could be wrong though.
---
No vats perks? Your accuracy was so good though
---
Yup. Happens whenever I make a bunch of boiled water 
---
I wish we had more budget
---
I never used the Gauss this way. Just spamming it? Seems bad but I’ll try it out
---
I have many friends that are low levels and I get nasty messages all the time. Thing is, I enjoy helping them, it is fun to run into a lot of the earlier quest lines that I have forgotten. Yes I am level 114 and running around with a level 9. I don't kill everyone with a TSE or let the lower level get away with a one shot xp steal. I make them work for their levels...but I am there in case some thing does happen. If a group of ferals overrun them. It makes me sad when people ruin the game for everyone else.
---
You need to find the body of a young woman in a tattered black dress. There are *many* scattered around Appalachia, and just following the main quest will take you to one very early. 
---
Two are in Morgantown (one near VTU and another at the sound end of town), and three in Charleston (Capital Building, Trainyard and AVR Medical). 
---
Idk what one OP is talking about but one of the same dudes who has been posting the exploits has a video of it and it's pretty much the same as before
---
The hero this community deserves
---
and this is why dealing with duped weapons is "wrong"
---
this is such an original idea, no one has EVER suggested this before!
---
What I mean is Closer engagements. Obviously I'll die if enemies are too close so I use the handmade still at some range, but I only use it if the enemy is Closer and not far enough for me to want to use my lever action.
---
I did
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afs7md/why_does_good_loot_feel_sadly_underwhleming/ For everyone who says  "what's the big deal, it already happened" because in a roundabout way its killing the game.
---
Mutations and gear, also concentrated fire works wonders. I'd like to fit in four leaf clover. but not sure what i want to give up to make it fit and in the case of that rifle it wouldn't help much anyways since its refilling crits nearly as fast as i could use them.
---
I've gotten a couple of them at uranium fever.
---
They break the servers, bud. 
---
Who collects codes anymore?
---
Ah okay gotcha. I thought maybe I was missing a fundamental perk and I could go ham on enemies with this thing up close &amp; personal. :)
---
Glowing ones were giving the same, if not more xp than the sbq with 1/10 of the effort.
---
Can confirm this, Ark is trolly as hell now though, there was a massive shift in Ark PvP where it went from fair player vs player, skill with well thought-out stats on both player and dinos, strategically placed and defended bases. Now it's just to "MOVEMENT SPEEEEEEEED" and clipped structures.
---
This is how you duped back when playing Sacred, yeah good times.
---
Are you sure?  Mine definitely is getting larger as I level up.  I can put more and more things down.
---
Either that or the calculation for how much any item takes up seems to be tied to it. 
---
I really hope the resolve the duping issue and if they did some sort of a server wipe to take all duped weapons out of the game.
---
But I would also feel bad for those who spent their hard earned caps on their dream weapkns just to have them taken away. 
---
But they will most likely try to just stop duping and say screw the items. Hopefully that doesnt take too long.
---
Bubbles in my beer? 
---
If you keep the method a secret Bethesda will decide not to fix it because the problem is not wide spread. 
---
Combat rifle has the best base damage. Handmade is op in terms of, fire rate, damage, capacity 
---
fair enough
---
Lol oh hell no. At least maybe not yet who knows. Tse guns will destroy you even in the best PA of you decide to shoot a ghoul at 3 arms lengths lol
---
Annoying and waste of bullets. 
---
WV, not WVA.
---
Why do you put quotation marks around wrong? I ask only out of curiosity.
---
“Stuff you can afford to remediate after you ship.”
---
I think you have hit upon the exact issue for why you are getting so many negative responses.  That philosophy requires a very fine judgement of customer expectation.  Miscalculation is so easy.  Can they afford all the negative response they have received?  Can they afford the drastic list price drops?  Can they afford the loss of players who were counted on to buy atoms?  Can they afford the loss of goodwill toward the franchise on their next launch?
---
I promise you sadly, people will lose jobs over this.  Even people who did their jobs well.  Can they afford that?  
---
When this launch becomes a b-school case study, it will be because it was not a success.  Your future alumni will have a field day pointing out the learning points about what not to do.  Todd and Pete will not come out looking like they analyzed “afford” well.  
---
I am also sure that Zenimax is looking at a revised eNPV that is in the tank.
---
So, what will they do now that will radically change the project’s trajectory and turn around their customer response?
---
(Personally, I think boldness is required.)
---
What armor effects vats?
---
Just get the code online they update every week so they self destruct
---
Good luck. 
---
So I can get a juicy Oh reply?
---
Oh... You were at Whitesprings. That honestly explains it all. Building at or even near Whitesprings tilts a certain group of people to the ends of the earth. 
---
Shielded Enclave operative under armors give +3 strength and +2 Perception
---
Watch their health. All that stacked mitigation doesnt do much against a 4k bloodied attack feom a full unyielding build. 
---
Youtube's lowest point, or Bethesdas?  I can understand the sentiment that players are to blame and should be held accountable (and to an extent they should) but honestly at the end of the day the blame is on the developer.  Players are not to blame for the rampant duping, Bethesda is, as they're the only ones that could have stopped it from ever becoming a thing, but their naive viewpoint on the situation is why it's the problem that it is today.  
---
I just can't put stock in a developer that genuinely believes that players won't try to do bad things in an MP game and thus the game doesn't need to be made secure pre-release.  I mean really **duping?**  This is a word I haven't heard in at least 10 years, because it's usually that simple to prevent it from happening.  It's like they've ignored the last 20 years of multiplayer gaming and live in their own little bubble.  Is there some level of blame on the players and/or Yong?  Sure, but ultimately this is **Bethesda's Fault**.   They could have easily prevented this from ever being a thing and the only thing that stopped them is their blatant negligence of the many problems that would be introduced with MP and refusal to accept a proactive approach.
---
I can’t imagine having such a worthless life that I cheated in a video game. I can’t imagine being so low IQ and low sportsmanship to rationalize it.
---
IF YOU'RE TRAVELIN' IN THE NORTH COUNTRY FAAAAIR
---
Been playing since beta, I do not like this change. I would have probably been on the hate train of this was a thing since the beginning...
---
People did seem to think it did for a while, but lately i've seen many say it does not. I personally didn't pay attention enough. I think if at all, it would only be increasing very small amounts until lvl 50. That's just spitballing though.
---
CruciformMoon52
---
Not really?
---
I don't think so. I think it increases and decrease dependent on where you place it. 
---
10 caps, big time villain I'm not. Relatively soon after the beta ended, wandering around the munitions plant while someone else owned it, curious what was behind the locked door on the main floor by the stairs. Didn't occur to me that it would make me wanted.
---
10 caps again just the other night. Saw a guy who was wanted, decided to turn off Pacifist mode and take him out. did so, now ***I'm*** wanted, wtf.
---
Only if you talk about meat constantly.
---
Got disconnected and can’t connect back to your world though 
---
Just sent you xbox message. 
---
Ground beef.
---
I played last night for the first time in a few weeks, and kept getting disconnected. I noticed every time that there were clusters of three people in various spots on the map, and this all makes perfect sense now. 
---
&gt; But I would also feel bad for those who spent their hard earned caps on their dream weapkns just to have them taken away. 
---
I don't feel THAT bad about them. Anyone who knows go onto various discords/subs/forums etc. likely have an idea of the state of the market.
---
If you know the majority of the market has ill-gotten goods, you're punishing someone who likely knows that the thing they purchased was "stolen".
---
It's like the laws about how you can't keep goods you've purchased that were previously stolen. I would have thought the same kind of principle applies.
---
You might sting a handful of legitimate people but if I were one of them, as much as it'd sting, I'd understand that it's for the greater good.
---
Did you posted a ticket for that? Have you contacted tech support? 
---
Wouldn't a duper be trying to make some kind of gain from their duping? Not just giving it away for free?
---
So, basically - RDR mini games?
---
What mutations do you have?
---
The reactor room glitched out and I decided to hop off I got to work in the morning
---
Did you ping the server using the Command Line on PC?  How did you do that? I'd be interested to know more about how they are running the servers and where they are. (Personal knowledge as well as re: this game.) 
---
I just picked up the Travel Perk card. Hopefully there''ll be another one. Sometimes I'm on North American servers and others seem mixed. 
---
It's worthless junk to us and takes up vital inventory space. If we can't benefit from it, at least someone else may as well.
---
Nah that's more of a country vibe.
---
Yes. I have like 1k stored in there from random plastic runs I do maybe once a week
---
That's what you think. ... Oh, you meant in the game. 
---
I really appreciate being able to talk about these issues as adults and I agree with you: Fallout 76 is a diversion for me until something better comes along. I put 1500 hours into Skyrim across four systems, but each Fallout game I spent less and less time with. And I actually like the lore and concept of Fallout better! Maybe it's just the changes in my life, but some of the wonder is gone for me with Fallout. I remember being blown away (pun intended) that you could actually blow up megaton. While Fallout 4 definitely has the best combat, removing karma, having factions I didn't really care about (In New Vegas I chose to rule with my robot army if that tells you anything), and shoving settlement building down my throat (I loved it for a time but felt the limitations quickly when it couldn't live up to my imagination - until I started using mods) it just seemed to be the least connected game with what fans/players wanted... until 76. I do like that 76 has the most diverse environments and the most new enemies in a while but the heart of Fallout has been whittled down. Not enough to make me not play it, but still enough to make me disappointed in what was lost. I'm looking forward to Cyber Punk. I hope you find that next great game too.
---
At first I thought so too. But I reread it, and I think he’s right. Look for the word consent.
---
Also mole rat teeth, please
---
Whats about the armor perk for it? Is that one good?
---
Try lookin’ up the soundtrack for 76 on Spotify or somewhere online! Hope you find your song 
---
Throw away power armor and get yourself shielded raider underamor, thats +3Agi, then if you dont have, birdbones adds +4agi, and there is some food cooked from scorchbeasts which gives +3agi. Boom, now you are invisible.
---
How do you know? There are plans for Combat Armour as well as Power Armour, aren't there?
---
 Gonna start doing this
---
I didn't win but I came dead last, that's still kind of special :). Thanks for doing this.
---
The game is too easy. Nukezones need hoards of enemies, no matter where they are dropped. Behemoth super mutants. Bosses that REQUIRE a group roaming through them.... With a malitia gaurding them.   More world bosses everywhere. Workshops need way harder enemies....
---
At this point with the amount of damage we are doing, Bethesda needs to look at Warframe. Arcade style armies of enemies. 
---
Or nerf the shit out of us. 
---
Id be fine with either but the games getting boring tbh. 
---
Thank you for caring about this game.
---
I did get disconnected a few times today and wondered why. Now I guess I know.
---
Now, is the catheter manual inserted by the user or does the PA automate that for you?
---
Username nusie666
---
What you got for me?
---
Because. 
---
Thats all you need to know
---
I mean now after reading this I see where your coming from and now I dont feel so bad. 
---
Atleast if they do this I already flipped mine for more caps.
---
Poor sucker’s never gonna know what hit em.
---
I don't use the armor perk as I use PA. But if it activates as much as the weapons one does it would be very good. 
---
With how things have gone I'm not so sure their original post-launch plans have survived intact. That's assuming they even actually were working on private servers and it not just being a figment of Todd's imagination.
---
The increases I noticed are definitely very little.  Starting about level 10 I tried building fancier layouts.  I would hit the budget cap, then I’d level up a couple times and could get just a few more decorations, etc.
---
Currently at 35 and just got Advanced Power Connectors and Powered Garage Door so I am redesigning my layout pretty heavily.  
---
If I or they had if then reddit would be the last place to say anything lol ;)
---
I already don't run power armor. I'm also something like 1/3rd a melee build so the strength is useful, The rest of the 3rds being Pistols and armor
---
I’m thinking about it. Already cleared the bunker but I’m trying to find more people. 
---
Fission core and any other ammo u could imagine 
---
5.56? 
---
Never happened to me in 350hours, and i play really aggresively like dickhead. Lots of people would like me dead. Only people i saw using boobleheads was for killing queen.
---
Yup 
---
The best thing i found was the two shot gatling gun by killing a legendary protectron. 
---
Yeah the doors don't show up.
---
Yee
---
Oh lol
---
Word. I’ll log on now then 
---
Instead of making a thread to scream about this I'll just yell here.
---
UN FREEZE GOD DAMN IT. OR! GIVE ME FUCKING SCRAP THAT IS 50 YARDS AWAY.
---
OR JUST DISCONNECT ME!!!!! 
---
I was so happy when I realized how cheap it was to repair everything. Not cheap I guess, but a whole lot cheaper than building it from scratch
---
There is a Spotify playlist with I think all the songs on it:

I got off for the night , message me tomorrow at 4 and ill hand u the goods
---
Sounds like they were baiting you into attacking them so they could kill you and collect caps since they know you’ll want revenge for destroying your hard work.
---
While there’s nothing you can do to avoid them besides hopping servers like you did there are ways to mitigate or potentially eliminate the damage they do.
---
First if you see an attack coming or they can’t finish your CAMP in one strike just log off.  If you’re lucky the damage will not be registered.
---
After the damage is done you can significantly cut the costs of rebuilding by taking the Intelligence perk called Contactor.  Though it only says Workshop items it definitely works on CAMP items too.  At level 18 rank one will give you 25% cost reduction and rank two gives 50% reduction.  Again though it only says build the reduction applies to repair costs as well.  Note that you will always need 1 of each build/repair material in unmodified list.  Cost can not reduce it to zero.
---
Then if you’re unaware there is a REPAIR ALL function on the CAMP device itself.  One click and you return your base to it unmolested state for 1/2 the cost.
---
Also for consideration is that scrapping destroyed crops will refund your building materials allowing you to replant them.
---
Some folk will tell you re-locating CAMP can completely restore your base for the cost of CAPS but it comes with its hazards.  You could have floating object problems not allowing you to place your saved CAMP blueprint down and even more annoyingly you can lose items this way meaning you’ll have to rebuild them anyhow.  I’ve lost walls and workbenches this way.  Just a guess but I think it’s tied to the fact that blueprint budget is smaller then total CAMP budget so they aren’t saved.  Just a guess though.
---
I've gone back and forth from attacking peoples bases to provoke a response to never turning pacifist mode off. I would hit a base enough to destroy about a wall once or twice, and wait in hopes the owner would come fight my ridiculously dressed raider. The build for him is pistols/Fists so nothing broken or hard to over come, but after watching people lose their shit to the point where I think they are having a mental breakdown i've kinda just stopped. I don't like ruining peoples play and never meant them that type of emotional stress. I think the last encounter I had  I just dropped 4x times the resources for their repair and just left. I've honestly think open world PVP should just be disabled and only keep it in certain areas of the game.
---
Yup same here that’s why I left didn’t want to give him any satisfaction. Let him be a child and I’ll come back and fix it later. 
---
Brand new king fu Kenny 
---
If you ever do Uranium Fever, the toolbox next to the weapons table is where I put all my left over items. I usually fill it with weapons, ammo, legendaries, plans, and other things. I'm not sure if anyone else does this but it's one of my main drop-off places. I'm on PC btw
---
GJ! Launching the nuke was a fun time for me and i'm glad to see other people are enjoying launching theirs as well.
---
I think this will be possible in the future i think
---
Any item with a condition has to be tracked individually, no?
---
This happened to me tonight. I had one more scorched detector to update. Now I can’t get the quest to come back and I cannot get it to restart. 
---
Succckkksssss
---
The bibles killed more than cancer.
---
I like it, spices it up a bit
---
I am using 4\* machete now, and have birdbones anyway. Can't imagine being without that slow falling now, but yeah, we can't have exact same builds, why would we do it :))
---
Do you have to  power fusion generators with fusion cores?
---
it does not increase with level, ppl have debunked this by testing building at level 10 and level 50/100 and yeah same budget. What I think does impact the budget is location (this is untested, unproven, but something i spotted myself). Build in somewhere that has a lot of extra world objects may decrease the amount of available budget you have, because it is overall polygon/complexity that controls your budget amount (and so i believe it takes into account the existing complexity in the build area).
---
Because, unironically, some people can’t stand that other people like the thing they hate.
---
Lmao this moron thinks games render inventory items!!!
---
Disconnecting? Gameplay bugs? Lack of endgame content? Hang on we’re banning people for duplicating weapons that we force you to spend hours farming.
---
I got my two shot explosive damage resist reloading lever action off of a ghoul in non nuked whitespring. I was so stoked and I will never trade it, it is only LV 35 but still shreds anything.
---
Lots of good fixes. Let's flip this flop! 
---
It does nothing for my energy weapons.
---
Lol. I had a wood leg the other day that had a damage value.
---
Marsupial and bird bones are game changers, I don't think i'd be able to play without them.
---
Have not missed it yet and has not been in game currently.
---
Looking foward to grabbing it myself.
---
You can't though. It doesn't have the damage. It's DPS is lower than the Gauss rifle. Even uncharged. 
---
No matter what perk set up or legendary effects a hunting rifle has vs a gauss rifle with the same setup, the Gauss beats the hunting rifle in every way. The hunting rifle can get a better magazine. Pretty sure that's the only thing it has more of. 
---
And I'm aware of the charge time of the gauss rifle. And it's about the same time as the bolt cycling animation of the hunting rifle. And a fully charged shot of a gauss rifle does double the damage of a hardened or 50 cal hunting rifle. And if you don't charge the shot, it has 50% the listed damage meaning it's damage is about equal to the hunting rifle. But you can fire uncharged gauss shots quite fast. 
---
So now the hunting rifle is both worse in damage, DPS, and rate of fire. I have no idea where you're getting this notion that the hunting rifle can equal or out preform the Gauss rifle. Because if that were the case, people wouldn't be asking for Bethesda to fix the 50 cal hunting rifle from being a joke. 
---
You must be new to Bethesda titles. 
---
Bethesda has dealt with this kind of wave of negativity many times in the past. 
---
Everyone here is talking as if it’ll kill them. Not only will it not, it won’t put a dent in their sales of this title 4, 14 or 24 months from now. 
---
They’re still selling Skyrim and F:NV,
---
Never mind F4. 
---
How well this new breed of product, on the other hand, scratches some itch in the myriad of different audiences attend it, will make or break it. 
---
This is the kind of product where “ship early” wins hands down 
---
I always leave my plans, recipes and unwanted legendaries in the blue suitcase at Watoga station.  
---
I leave plans in the Overseer Stashes where Noobs can pick them up.
---
While that would be nice, it's impossible. No way do they have enough server capacity for that.
---
I too would like to know this if we have anyone who has done the work testing it.
---
There are armor mods combined with perks that can make you immune to explosives, or so I've heard
---
Yeah, that doesn’t answer anything. That merely says using mods may result in the game not working correctly.
---
So you’re a duper then?
---
The only time i destroy a base is to those people who already destroyed mine or who build some kind of turret wall behind the golfclub. I hate those guys &gt;;(

---
I found about 4 dog food in a place east of Whitespring. It was a good haul.
---
It’s all good.  What I lost in caps, I gained in materials.  It would have been nice to keep my screws and gears.  Plus I’m out of the cesspool.  Once the female character used the “come here” emote, I knew she was going to take my dropped loot.  After that happened, I lost all interest in staying in the area.
---
I’ll just fast travel like anyone else when there’s a nuke dropped on the place.  And who knows, maybe I can find a few good legendaries around my new neighborhood.
---
VTU jumpsuit plan. 
---
Same here, haven't missed it yet. It will be set next to my power armor statue
---
One would assume that to be the entire point of duping. Him giving it away for free would be counter productive to duping in the first place.
---
How much you want for X01 Calibrated shock?
---
Im so mad i was getting rid of some holotapes and accidentally threw all my games away ;(

Sounds good. I’ll be on tomorrow around 7 cst

I actually feel like fallout 4 took more time to travel by foot. 
---
Yep! Are the locations different for different platforms? I’m pretty new to this game.
---
Unfortunately I’m on Xbox, had to make the choice between buying the game on xbox or pc... I will know better next time
---
I put a lot of stuff in the cash register in Whitespring's Artisan's Corner.
---
Yes. Bug since last patch 
---
&gt;Players are not to blame for the rampant duping, Bethesda is
---
That's a ridiculous statement on the face of it. It's like saying that people are responsible for theft for not locking their doors. No the thieves are responsible 100% for the theft. No one MADE them steal. Same too with dupers.
---
Sure, Bethesda bare SOME responsibility, but only in resolving the issue as quickly as they can, which they seem to be doing.
---
Just reading through your whole comment, you're placing a whole lot on Bethesda that no reasonable person would.
---
"they're the only ones that could have stopped it from ever becoming a thing " - unreasonable expectation. No developer could ever stop people from finding and using exploits.
---
"can't put stock in a developer that genuinely believes that players won't try to do bad things in an MP game" - do they really believe that or is that you just projecting something that just isn't there?
---
"It's like they've ignored the last 20 years of multiplayer gaming and live in their own little bubble." - It's their first multiplayer game. It's never been done by this company at all, or by any company using this engine. Once again unreasonable expectation.
---
&gt; Is there some level of blame on the players and/or Yong? Sure, but ultimately this is **Bethesda's Fault** 
---
Let's not blame the victim here. It's easy to because it's Bethesda and there's a TON of things you can directly blame them for. This one, not so much. Let's not pretend to diminish the responsibility of the people who hacked/exploited their way into the room.
---
Yong's responsibility is the least of all parties but it says a lot that he bashes Bethesda incessantly in this issue while not only says nothing negative about the actions of the hackers/exploiters but also warns people of their ilk to not follow suit lest they get banned too. In this specific instance, Yong is neither a good or honest actor.
---
I’ve seen screens posted in this sub twice...
---
Lots of brahmin and 2 radstags in flatwoods. Also a dead yet harvestable radstag on the way to flatwoods from the overseers camp
---
Yeah then might have to wait for now then. Wierd thing right you would want people becomming attached to the community as much as possible. Guilds / clans are a good way to keep people playing long after they would of normally stopped. Also they can really increase the fun side of things been apart of them.
---
I always leave my ammo, junk, plans, and recipes near the overseer's camp.
---
As others have said stimpak/booze(with the perk) revive fallen players. 
---
If you can see a player is firing an explosive weapon at the queen don't jump up and down in front of them. 
---
Molotov's &gt; Frags for mass tagging in whitesprings.
---
Really anything that adds to the efforts of others is appreciated, while flinging corpses with frags or triggering TSE suicide by running into the line of fire gets creative language thrown at you. There is a "Team Up" emote that will often get you into a team that has space, and having 3 Charisma with Rad-Sponge to share will always be a nice touch. If you've got a mic and are dropping an unused ammo type after looting several kills let people know, free ammo is honestly the biggest gift i can receive as a shotgun user.
---
Yeah, it should always default to frag grenade (if you have any). This happens to me all of the time. 
---
You realize both the first two are related, right? Infinite carry let you have massive amounts of items on your person. Dupers carry massive amounts of items on them. Tying in the third, if folks found a new method for duplication, then logically they're carrying massive amounts of items as well.
---
Remember what they said when they increased the stash limit? That they were thinking about raising it more based on how much it affects server stability?
---
Using our logical reasoning, we can therefore deduce that carrying more weight with a character uses more server resources, and any glitches/exploits/whatever that involve carrying asstons of resources will therefore cause server instability. So, therefore, infinite carry weight glitch and duplication glitches, for all intents and purposes, have the same negative effects on the servers.
---
After the beta when launching nukes became a normal thing for people it was discovered you could get massive xp when you grind whitesprings during a nuke. To put it simply a nuke zone in whitesprings meant you got 10-20 levels depending on spawns guaranteed. People would launch multiple nukes a day in their groups and server hop for more nukes. In otherwords, it literally got to the point that it was normal to go up 20 or so levels a day if you tried. It wasn’t hard at all.

Plus you get a good pile of XP crafting as per your OP

No. They are regular power sources just like the small, medium, and large generators. They output 100 power.
---
Because this is how AAA companies fix their games, they browse reddit to see if there is a post on the front page.
---
When you learn a prime weapon recipe, you also learn the recipe for its associated ultracite ammo. If you recieved a primed weapon from a trade youll have to buy the ammo 
---
What are you fighting that your TSE lever or handmade isn't doing enough damage? I have a regular hunting rifle and can one shot almost everything. Tougher mobs maybe a few shots.
---
Don’t build at white springs. Your shit will get fucked. 
---
No.. it's something that happened
---
This is demonstrably false, I can show you straight up Empath and grounded not getting 75% off, healing factor is the only one with a broken tooltip the rest of the ones not getting reductions from class freak are just wrong.  
---
You get the plans for the mods from the queen or scorchbeasts. Im curious as to where you are encountering weapons with the prime receiver as they do not drop.
---
If you have been buying them then youll need to go farm the queen for prime plans so you can make ammo for them. Once you learn the receiver you can then make the ammo. Or you can buy the plans from other players.

From my bethesdian adventure the past 3 weeks, I cannot tell you how often I ran into something that I thought just possibly can't be there in 2018, from one of the largest companies in the industries, when even 5€ indie studios are able to avoid ancient online gaming mistakes like to trust the client.
---
For me, at this point, even the most ridiculous structural mistake is reasonable.
---
Exactly. I usually go to my camp or the nearest wanted person and explain to them what happened and see if they want me to get rid of their wanted. 
---
I have found another bug with these perks. If you pacify your bugged tamed creature before logging out they are permanently pacified from then on, but then they won't even defend themselves. This has caused me to now have to build turrets to protect my lvl 21 deathclaw from level 3 mongrels... Fix the bugged animal friend and wasteland whisperer perks please, or at least acknowledge you have seen this bug report u/LoneVaultWanderer

Also, sorry if I can't/not supposed to tag you.

I'm so glad someone posted this. I accidentally triplicated a Halloween Mask with friends and wondered why no one else sorted this out yet.

Its alright friend thanks again

It does enough damage, but I want it to do MORE is what I'm asking. I can one shot things easily. 
---
scorched queen will drop random Prime weapons mod plan.
---
you can craft ultracite ammo once you learn the mad.
---
Agreed.  I made a spreadsheet of all the in game plans and for now keep track of it this way.  I know its a work around and not the in game fix we want but at least its something.
---
Feel free to copy it.  I loaded Google Sheets on my phone and keep this list open when buying from vendors.

Hate to say it but after dup patches may have to do a wipe.  Really is disheartening to have loot like that lose its value and rarity.
---
SBQ - TSE handmade and TSE Shotgun for the adds. Still mad i dished out a pile of caps for the shotgun to do nothing to the queen.
---
Whitesprings - Anti-Armor Supersledge and Two-Shot Limb Damage combat shotgun. Both land for 50% HP on the bloated glowing ones, makes for good team XP/Loot sharing.
---
Oh nice, I'll try to look for one then.  The mediums take so much space!

My previous base was just past the mine and power station across the street.  I guess I got too close to the hive of scum and villainy, huh?
---
My Red Dead's on XBox 1X.  I was kind of joking about that but it's a very professionally made Triple A game, as was Horizon Zero Dawn. No crashes or bugs in months of play. But yeah, when a game is $100 Australian I expect to enjoy the damn thing.  I'm really keen for the modders to get further involved, though I doubt it will be very large involvement due to the game type.  
---
Sometimes it bugs enemies out so they get stuck in the ground and can't attack you
---
He’s not advocating duping he’s just realistic that the more people who know the method the more who will try it they bigger the impact will be... 
---
It’s not terrible logic if you consider any amount of duping to be bad for the game. Make the issue flare up fast and big to force Bethesda to address it faster. 
---
I am level 175 got explosive dragon, 10mm smg, double-barrel shoty, laser pistol, assault rifle, all legit droped, not best rolls but they were usable. So even without dupers, there would be loads of explosive weapons users. Stacked boobleheads will be fixed soon i belive.
---
This one
---
I think id be ok with a wipe. And it is sad to see such good weapons go fo so little
---
I had to have it hit me direcytly in the face
---
Because we already have confirmed instances of this happening on the sub before. A notable example is the trade stealing glitch - it doesn't exist and never did, yet hundreds of people were going around spreading lies like that. There was another claim about it being possible to steal people's power armor, even with atom shop paint (spoiler alert: that was never a thing either). Some people straight up invented stories about people in this game hacking their ip, taking down their routers, or some other shit like that. 
---
OP already deleted most of the post, but based off the comments OP's argument relied on pretending that the infinite carry weight glitch still exists (it was patched a month ago). If this dupe glitch ever existed (spoiler alert: OP made it all up), then it would have been patched back in december along with the carry weight glitch and this post would be completely pointless due to that.
---
While this is not complete proof by itself, ever since all these stories of obscure glitches came up, I started following a couple of the glitching youtubers to see how many of them were verifiable. One of them who I obviously won't name had a video of how to dupe just hours after the patch before this one that supposedly fixed it. Surprise surprise, nobody has made a tutorial on how to dupe since the jan 10 patch. 
---
All of these stories appeal to a simple mind for one reason - they are vague enough to be believable, yet lead you on by making it sound plausible. I have seen three different supposed sides of this in the past few days posted - one person said there is a method involving vendors that does not crash the server, OP says there's one that requires 3 people and crashes servers, and at least two people said they found one they were able to replicate individually. 
---
Does that sound familiar? It's almost like the trade stealing "glitch" - multiple people all making up different and conflicting stories, being intentionally vague and hiding behind the "I don't want to spread it" defense. Again, I have no clue why people are lying about this - even months after release, there are still plenty of trolls wasting their time every day here, this could definitely be a part of them. There are even rumors that people are organizing shit like this as a hit to further bring down the game because they believe its current state is more popular than it deserves. Whatever the actual reasoning behind it is, it's clear that this post is absolute bullshit

I had the falsely accused quest line start for me while the collar was in my inventory, not sure if it has to be equipped. 
---
I kinda hope were not done with the scorched. They are a unique threat that they could do alot with. Reasoning that it affects nothing is cause maybe SBQ isn't a unique creature? The reason it's currently a boss for us is cause it's the first one for us to come across? Who knows, BGS has alot of wiggle room to do what they want here and I hope that if they do decide they are done with the scorch that they are able to make interesting conflicts/enemies for us to deal with in the future. Just my 2cents

Yeah my explosive combat rifle is only lv 40 but I will use it until I cant anymore

I check the Atoms shop every day, specifically for camp items. The succulents, modern fireplace, wood craftsmen door, faux folk art painted Scandivanian door, and nice floors are all well and good (and purchased already by me), but where are the nice clean rugs; nice clean curtains; working refrigerators; clean working stoves; clutter; dining room placemats with plates, cups and more; desk clutter with typewriters, teapots and file folders; airstream trailers; various wooden crates; toolboxes in various colors; tattered posters and papers for walls; hanging plants; and better walls and windows for build plans?
---
I'm gonna completely finish this game and move on before we get some of these things, I'm afraid. Enough with the nerfing and additional grinding - more camp items, please!
---
I’d even be ok with an item/caps wipe and let people keep their levels and respec.

Awesome! Wish I had plans for you folks.

No but a problem being seen by a lot of people and being spread makes it more likely that someone from fallout 76’s dev team will see it. 
---
$1/1hr rule
---
200 hrs is worth $60, 100%

oh I agree, i'm sure there's something greater controlling her down there (some sort of Gravemind type mushroom dude would be my guess). but for now she's the top of the food chain, and the game does acknowledge that "her reign is over" so I just figure something happen from that (till we meet that spooky mushroom dude) would be a cool bonus to bring the server together to take her down. 
---
Oh my goodness yes!  I wish I could make a separate stash box and keep clothes in it.  Im not even asking for a limit increase...just let me get it out of my Armor and Underarmor list.  My goodness have I collected! :)
---
Plans or no, if you're on xbox please feel free to play with us if you see me online!
---
That is all.
---
I've avoided this feeling by just avoiding trading over all. Till the whole situation has been resolved i'll just push my face into the grinder till I get what I need. At the very least this has caused me to get alot of plans that I didn't even know existed till that point.
---
It is a random spawn at certain locations only.   
---
The VTU jacket is kinda hard to come by also as it only has one spot that I know of. 
---
I think that is the only mod
---
Yes, this happened to me today after trying on the Spacesuit and then putting on my PA,  Couldn't get out of it until I logged out and back in again.
---
Watoga's a good spot. Today someone dropped a big bag of plans. I took a couple I didn't know yet and then added my own. A few minutes later I came back and someone else dropped another bag of plans beside it.
---
Lmaoo
---
The Rifle and Dragon have bayenets, not sure about the others.
---
Can others see your weapon?
---
Accidents happen, at least you tried making it right, most wouldn’t. 
---
Maybe it's the wind. 
---
 GET YA MEATS HERE! GET YA MEATS!!! I GOT ALL TYPES OF MEATS HERE!!
---
omg... that's so appropriate!
---
Does that make me an "everyday folk"? :D
---
They cleaned his pipes.
---
Yeah, it would be neat. AT the very least like a 15% XP bonus for everyone on the server, or 5% chance(One star) Legendary drops on all Scorch. 
---
You can only get the reward (100 caps, missiles, combat armor or shishkebab.) Once a day now, as "intended". That's once a day per silo, but when I play with my friends we normally do about ten nukes in a few hours. 
---
Enclave Scout Armor and matching Under Armor is probably your best bet. Urban for grey tones camo or forest for green/brown. Otherwise BOS combat armor with the atomic store camo paint is a good look.
---
Ah, neato. The one I wish I knew of was that camouflage jumpsuit, apparently it had a set spawn in the beta but isnt there any longer :c
---
This happened in fo4 too. The radium rifle with a reflex sight was a nightmare to use with the stealth boy PA mod.
---
There was a perk card for modifying black powder weapons, but it was removed from the final version of the game for some reason.
---
Shame.
---
It's naht thuh wind!
---
Ah, that sucks. Well, get that grind on my dude.

The main use that comes to mind is that they are needed for craftable one use water filters.

I’ve had over 1.2 million pounds on me for about 2 months. Browsing inventory is instant, no delays on anything. Opening/using containers take an absolute max of 1 second to open interface.

Your history with their titles is irrelevant. This conversation isn’t about you.

For someone who claims to have gone to business school, I don’t see what the problem is parsing a simple breakdown of business risk (demand risk versus PR risk).

I just now got 4 stamens while I was sitting at my camp doing nothing.

on pc theres almost always 1 guy that shows up at the queen wearing full assassins sentinels and just stands in 1 spot murdering everyone until we can swarm him with staggers, but even then hes winning
---
That's never going to happen.
---
I'd be surprised if they even drop their current monetization plans and instead release something big for free as a compensation.
---
They probably think they already did that via gifting everyone the 20 year old original fallouts everyone and their mother already had and that have been available for 0-1€ innumerable times. (I remember getting my second copy of Fallout 1 from a MAGAZINE for 4,90, back when those were a thing and had CD-ROMs with games in them...)
---
I like my camp like I like my house in real life, when the lights are on it's bright as fuck and I can see everything with no problem lol. You would probably cry if you saw the led flood lights I have around the outside of my house.
---
when is someone going to make a story with screenshots
---
Last time I had that much inventory my game could barely load anything.
---
Yeah, super not normal. I have a r3 2200g and a gtx 760 and can do better than that. Not much better though lol.

Did you complete the fort defiance quests?

---
I think it should give you a warning if a non-combat action will invite a bounty; picking a lock in a CAMP/Workshop etc. I've seen a lot of lowbies get accidently wanted, and they don't all know to stash their junk before they get taken out. 
---
agreed, nothing points to it awarding better loot or from a more desirable loot pool.  I have been turning in 2 at a time for over a week with nothing to show from it other than stuff I have gotten when I was doing 1. 
---
But does she weigh as much as a duck?
---
Glad to learn I ain't the only one.
---
Ah ok. Maybe it's a queen thing then. Haven't gotten to that point yet.
---
Sorry to hear it in any case.
---
If it is irrelevant, why did you bring it up?  #troll
---
Fast travel mats exist in the workshop menu only, not in CAMPs. They were removed during or just after the beta. 
---
Luckily you need way less stimpacks since it heals REALLY fast, but you do need to be out of combat for it to Regen.
---
No matter how right you likely are this sub is beyond listening to reason at this point. It frankly surprises me the BGS even bothers with this place at all. Nevermind that in order to successfully dupe you need to be able relog into the same server to collect the other items being duped thus actually multiplying the items. Duping without getting into the same instance just gives you back your items more or less
---
I'd agree, I play Destiny, but when I PvP there, it's a clear decision, &amp; I know what I'm getting into when I go to quickplay/comp.
---
 In FO76, the "vibe" us just diff, &amp; I have no inclination to roam &amp; even try to annoy people into PvP...it just seems rude &amp; pointless. The notion that anyone, of any level, can keep trying to be such an annoying prick to force you to PvP seems like such a dick move. What's the point? And don't DARE say it's a role-play. Some dude building a box isn't into your dumb role play fantasy, &amp; saying that they are is a fallacy.
---
Iirc anything you can't use in power armor is an unarmed weapon

Mine usually spawns me in the same spot (in my locked generator room) but occasionally it'll spawn me half-way down the cliff.

Ok so I noticed today and yesterday that these huge monstrosities kept appearing with 10+ large generators and such.  All metal three stacks high with security doors and all the nice tech.  No way they were within budget.  Servers crashed non stop and would just say waiting on the main screen.
---
he looks sad :(
---
There’s a reason why i always type “and everybody clapped” in those posts. Shit at this point I’d rather mods just ban all posts relating to dupers and getting attacked by other players. 
---
Why would downvotes matter if this post contains no information. They don't need to see this post they just need to see the report that was made.
---
I called you out and described your personality in an unflattering way. Deal with it. You're petty and vindictive and you get off on annoying people undercover of anonymity because you're a coward IRL. Whether things can be fixed isn't relevant, though it costs people convenience and resources. The argument that because Bethesda provide the wrecking ball Perk Card that means it's to be used on people not accepting the PvP, is bullshit. If the PvP has been accepted by the person you're attacking, then go for it. It's on, wrecking ball or whatever lifts your skirt. It's not about what you think the game allows you to get away with - it's about you. 
---
It's not PvP if it's not by consent - it's pathetic, low-level, High School bullying. That's how the PvP and bounty system are set up - to discourage creepy little incels. Deal with it. You trolls are as selfish and pathetic on Reddit as you are in Fallout 76. Thankfully most of us are cool people - like the cool guy in this thread, who was making guns for the people running out of the shelter (before the troll loser killed him and put a stop to it to steal his resources).  
---
The obsession people have with duplicating items in this game is so fucking cringe.

Where'd you find that?

There's one in the raider town near top of the world as well, inside one of the houses nearish to the arena where the power armor is.

I don’t agree with Saudi Arabia laws, so I never plan on traveling there. If you do not agree with EULA, or want to deliberately violate it, just because you can - be ready to accept consequences for your actions.

I wouldn't care about a fake post either.
---
I have play on PS4, you smart slug.
---
Handmade much better recoil.
---
Delusional? Maybe... But irrelevant. The game is awash with ways to ruin another's day and people with the motivation to do so for fun, spite, and profit. Like with gta v the fanboys are never going to find peace in public servers it's as simple as that.

No need for name calling. Let’s keep it civil. Sorry if I’ve upset you. 
---
The reason I pointed it out is because they’ve weathered large media shitshows in the past. Refer new Vegas. It’s all a day’s work for them. 
---
Judging by how it affects their long-haul
---
risk appetite (not very), I’d say they take the long term view. You know, selling so well they can find a business case to re-releasing a title 7 years later on 1980’s Casio calculator watches kind of long haul. 
---
We’re all on the media cool-aid, but the reality is we’re all here, on this forum, enjoying the game, and as of the last patch, quite grateful too. 
---
Don't be vague. I need all the help I can get to find decent plans. I lost my top-hat in the blast zone and spent all day yesterday looking for another one. These things are important to me. ;D

Does the weapon swapping break stealth and aggro mobs?

---
&gt; The trade without consent referred to the trade menu opening without you accepting to trade with someone
---
Then it wouldn't be phrased "We no longer let trades occur", it would mention the trade window. Not the same thing.
---
Right because before you could look at the other person's inventory without them accepting a trade invite. You could just send the invite and imediately see what they had stored. You couldn't take anything

I use the armour perk at max. Hardly ever have to repair any of my combat armour.

That's the quest reward. Shows up as PA chassis.

I'm gonna check this out with my heavy/criticals INT build, was just gonna be explosives and range but it's meant to be a unique kind of a psycho tech user.

I'm bout to switch my nerd rage / unyielding / adrenal reaction / radicool unarmed build to a chainsaw. I found one recently and was intrigued, kept it in stash. I run around 29 STR at low HP and am about to get nerd rage.

Thank you. I was a little worried someone was missing their PA. Glad I’m still glitch free. 
---
Downvoted cuz it’s da hip thing to do?
---
Fog of war :D
---
Nah, sorry, I ended up finding a pretty good one shortly after getting on to check and see if I had a rifle for you.
---
Let’s not jump to conclusions like the “hE sToLe My WhOlE iNvEnToRy FrOm ThE tRaDe MeNu” that everyone believed immediately with no proof. If enough people are using a dupe method that *EVERYONE* is getting disconnected I guarantee there’s a guide out. No way that many people just figured it out.

I’ll probably get downvoted for this post but this sub is quick to grab the pitchforks

Always nice to learn something new

I found mine from treasure maps.

I know the watoga vendor sells dense sometimes. As for padded that is the armor mod to learn while scrapping and i have not seen it in the wild.

No, it's simply a client-side graphical thing.

---
So weird, because I almost never see anyone let alone have them mess with me. Every once in a great while I'll have someone take my workshop but that's it. Other than that, it's rare to even come across another player. Never once have I been slapped to death through passive mode. Either it's as common as people like you make it out to be and I'm insanely lucky, or you guys had it happen once or twice and feed of each others outrage to make it seem bigger than it is. 
---
Not really. I do have fancy PC and keyboard, with programable buttons. I just don’t play on PC anymore. I prefer hackers free environment for my gaming pleasure. But PC without the question have better graphics - please enjoy them.
---
Anti armor legendary effect combined with rank 3 incisor ignores 87.5% of armor
---
That's a decent idea (and one that I've thought of already), but shouldn't really be necessary for something that seems more like an oversight than anything.
---
Lmao. Glad you didn't scrap yours like I did mine. I didn't know that even if you couldn't wear it it would recall to your inventory. Man, I felt like a ape for at least a week after that

I bought the Dense marine armor mod from Watoga box Phoenix.

People may downvote trade here because there are specialized subs for that.
---
In my stash box
---
This is true. If they get a very small % of reports it won’t be an urgent issue to fix, and they’ll just schedule it. If it catches on like crazy, they’ll escalate a fix. 
---
Why did it take them a month to add push to talk? Why did it take them so long to fix the xp and infinite weight exploit? How have they tried like 3 times and still not fixed the duplication exploit? Why can one guy with some spare time make a functional text chat and keep it updated but Bethesda can't implement such a necessary and basic feature? Why don't they realise they need to add a global cooldown on actions and this would fix a  very large chunk of exploits and server issues in one fell swoop? I mean people can lag out an entire server by crafting too much lmao. 
---
Only answer I have is they must have like 2-3 people total working on the game, what other online game out there by a big name studio no less goes a month with no patches especially right after release with all the problem the game has?
---
The person who flattened my house and destroyed everything in it was probably annoyed that he couldn't pick the lock without the turrets killing him.  All he would have found in there was my stash box. He got nothing but the visceral joy of satisfying his need to gutlessly annoy another human when they weren't there to protect their stuff. 
---
Incidentally, the locks on doors and water-purifiers are really useful when combined with turrets. They get killed before they can get in. You can shoot people while they're trying to break in because they can't do both at once. 
---
I regularly don’t get accepts on my group requests (made specifically for this reason) and it’s a bummer because I can go broke so quickly fast traveling (at least at my rate) and it’s tough to sustain the cap loss constantly. 
---
This is why I always accept group requests. 
---
This needs way, way more attention.
---
Thank you. 
---
❤️
---
I don't know how you're not beating your head into a pulp responding to so many dense folks. Youre the hero this sub deserves in the hour of madness
---
I feel like Bethesda made a mistake if this is true. I'd be HOT if one dropped near me, &amp; I just happened to stop by &amp; p/u a few items, only to suddenly find myself wanted.
---
You want to PvP? Cool on you, I ain't mad at ya. But if the devs are sneakily putting bounties on unsuspecting players unbeknownst to them, then that's some shady BS. 
---
If I decide to PvP or engage in a fight, cool, I'll do so. But to trick people into it? That's shitty.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Umm.. I have one built in my camp right now. Not sure what you mean.

Lol, so it's not just me that was bothered about some of the songs in the other Fallout 76 playlist.

Server issues do not equal duping method. 
---
Damn!, do they always do that?, I’ve been picking the things up as scrap for ammo...
---
You sound pretty convincing. I'm gonna believe you. \*thumbs up\*
---
I wouldn't use it personally unless you don't mind possibly getting banned and maybe having to jump through some hoops to get your account back or never getting it back. Bethesda seems pretty twitchy with their finger on the ban hammer at the moment so probably not the best time to test the waters.
---
I haven't started on 76 yet (I'm still saving up to order a few parts to build my pc), but it's shit like this that makes me not want to play until everyone in my clan has it. People are too quick to judge, and too many people want to be showered with praise for "being a hero". Just play the game, and when you find someone who IS duping, deal with it calmly. Duping sucks, but it sucks more when you shit on someone else's experience without any good reason.

Use a build planner such as the one at [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/) or [FalloutBuilds.com](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/) to plan our your build. Nukes and Dragons has a leveling roadmap and support for alternate perks; FalloutBuilds.com has builds/guides submitted by other players (so you can browse those for ideas), and support for mutations.
---
Avoid trying to incorporate more than one weapon type in your build, unless one of them is melee (as melee requires low investment to be strong). Enemy HP scales a lot at higher levels, so you need to invest a lot of perks into increasing a weapon type's damage for it to be useful; you won't have enough room in your build for more than one weapon, especially if you want to include a few non-combat/quality-of-life perks as well.
---
A hunting rifle is strong at low levels, so it's helpful to use early in the game, even if your build doesn't plan to use rifles later on. Shotguns can be effective at longer range if you use Skeet Shooter perk (under perception). So pick either rifles or shotguns, and plan your build for it. You can use the search feature of the build planners to find all perks related to a specific weapon type.
---
Almost all builds should use Lone Wanderer (under charisma), and Starched Genes and Class Freak (under luck). If you use guns, you should use Gunsmith (under intelligence). If you primarily use armor (instead of power armor), you should use White Knight (under agility). Blocker (under strength) is also highly recommended for all builds.
---
for sure! cant get bummed about dying when you have nothing to lose

Alright well if you want it you can have it for a few hundred caps. I'm probably just going to vendor it otherwise.

super loved getting a disease every time i spawned in the water when i had a camp in the mire

I cannot get mods for the L I F E of me. Scrapped maybe 8-10 and have two mods...

Dropped a two shot version of this and almost have completely replaced it since it’s so standard and outclassed without mods

one step further. allow for item Locking. Small padlock icon beside the item in inventory. once lock the item cannot be sold, trade or scrapped. it can only be repaired or used.
---
YongYea right? That guy is just a fucking piece of **** leech that feed on negativity and other people's hard work and his fanbase praises him as if he's a savior of the game industry. 
---
Ya, I would probably be annoyed if I had paid full price for it as well. Like you say, it's Bethesda, noy some small indie company. But in my opinion the game is disappointing(for all the reasons), not directly bad. 
---
I was also going in to the game suspecting a train wreck, I wasn't even planning on buying the game despite thousands of hours in morrowind/fallout3/fallout4/skyrim because it just sounded like a cash grab and an online griefer playground.
---
Not sure what I'm trying to say anymore :) bit tl:dr
---
If you buy it for a low price, like Bethesta games and don't think you'll get the next 10000h world of fallout, you'll probably get your moneys worth.

So I actually like fighting her in the radiation of the nuke zone, but I found I crash less often if I put fissure site prime on the edge of the zone, so when a lot of players show up there aren't all those extra effects. She flies towards you out of the zone, you could even put a camp nearby for repairs if you aren't afraid of her destroying it.  I haven't crashed at her since I started doing this. 
---
I can't fit them in. I would also like to be able to keep some Power Armour I'm not using but I can't afford the space.

I don't think so, sorry, but I hope we run into each other, buddy! 😊 and cool of you to help out!

I was tired for one, and who cares ghram is amazing so deal with it

3 times in the last 15 minutes for me (PC)

I'd love to play red dead. I'm a pc gamer and I have a switch sadly, so I'm SOL.

Fort Defiance in the bog ..
---
The golf courses have some pretty flat terrain but water may be an issue if you don’t have the land based pump. Also, if you build at Whitsprimgs there is a decent chance that your camp will get nuked. Why is having flat terrain critical for you?
---
Which weapons do you plan on carrying in this build?    Obviously a shotgun and a heavy gun but specifically what?
---
The lack of Bear Arms or any other carry weight perks might slow you down a bit depending on what your are carrying.
---
are you kidding me
---
I spent 276 caps on fucking that
---
Fully agreed.
---
I had the issue of the holo tape not being there. I relogged 3 times then it finally showed up. Keep trying!
---
just think of him sitting in his underground fungus lair shaking his mushroomy hands at us every time we foil his evil mushroom plans for world domination!

I think my favorite is sneaking around and getting spotted because you can't get behind cover cause you can't move.
---
I posted earlier how the servers were stable and I hadn't noticed any problems. Then I had like 2 crashes and a disconnect in a row within about a 10 minute period. I deleted that post.
---
there were only like 4-5 players :x 
---
I got caught at the Pumpkin House today. I was getting pumpkins for the ‘bot, and if you’re familiar with the area, there is a fissure nearby. The Cancer Bat saw me and just started screaming non-stop.
---
Nearby, fortunately, there is a wrecked house with a storage container. Climb to the top and drop down into the house to find a simple bunker. I put on my PA to protect me from the rads, and picked the safes while I waited. The Bat never left, but eventually I went into [Hidden] state and was able to Fast Travel back to the Pumpkin House and finish the quest.
---
Looking at the age of the OP, maybe that wasn’t an option back then, but it works now.
---
(I’m the OP and) I have both now. With primes.
---
The Gatling on a prime doesn’t much outdo the Gatling without, because gatling’s prime takes away the 25% fire rate advantage of the speedy receiver, replacing it with a higher DPH and a *slower* ammo burn. 
---
I fully agree with u/CaptainCummings - the 50
---
Cal has (substantially) higher DPS. 
---
NEITHER is guaranteed to outlast a prime aite encounter. I head in with 3 Bloodied gatlings (2 prime, 1 standard) and one prime 50 cal.

I use the two prime gatlings for sustained nonstop fire (sustained is what the 50 cal doesn’t  do as well), and for anti aircraft work, where the hit rate is shit anyway. Once an SBQ lands and I can both get a near 100% hit rate and close in for less damage range drop off. Once she takes off again, reload the duce and pull out the prime Gatling again. The regular Gatling is reserved for non-scorched like whitesprings, and as a backup when they all break. 
---
Yikes, sorry to hear about that. Do you know if the maps is nuked or not?
---
Compensator reduces recoil 10% while costing you some range but improves accuracy. Muzzle Brake is 20% recoil reduction with greater range cost and decreased accuracy. Suppressor 25% recoil reduction with greatest range cost and silences weapon, with accuracy increased. 
---
Sort of new to the game, but is the duping the main reason for instability? I've had a lot of disconnects this first weekend and noticed the game feeling very unoptomized/lagy despite a powerful pc.
---
"Want to kill a human?"... every time i hear this i just kinda back up slowly like i didn't just hear that
---
Well, the exploit is only going to increase your chances several-fold. The chances are still pretty poor overall, so bad luck can easily play into it.
---
That, or, as is speculated often, there's some confounding factor that affects the roll of the dice for some characters or accounts.
---
Still, try the edge for stability. It's more stable when I'm the only person there. 
---
In the middle of the zone, once it's about three or four people it starts stuttering for me. If it's on the edge, then I can usually see about ten people before it starts stuttering. 
---
Either way we need official word from Bethesda to stop misinformation with what mods are good and what are bad.
---
Even at minimum wage you made your money worth
---
I have a flight helmet that I've never seen anyone wearing. 
---
You had to taunt the servers eh? So it's your fault?!      /s  XD
---
Maybe you picked up something in the area or tried to open a locked container while the camp was under ownership. I did that once, accidentally and the same thing happened to me. The booting out was probably a coincidence because the game is borked.
---
The game has fallen in to cracks between game genres. It was never intended to be an ‘mmo’ in the eso sense - the map is too small and there are too few players and hardly anything to do. It isn’t meant to be FO5 either - there is little single player content beyond the tutorial. FO76 was meant to be a PVP sandbox and probably should have been an expansion for FO4 or a multiplayer component of FO5.
---
Why would you pick those up. Stick to the scrap steel.....
---
I haven't tested it with another player and asked them, sorry.
---
I already provided the idea of a PvP arena with caps betting, someone pointed out that it can be abused and people would use it for real world cash. As for thinking we wanted PvP, I think the reason is commonly for mmos people love PvP, don't forget about ESO. Though with ESO atleast in the overworld you have to accept a duel. They wanted the people who wanted to roleplay as a raider to be able to do so, and the bounty system was to add an edge to allow those who dont to refuse but its so easy to abuse. Fighting a super mutant and the player jumped in front of your shot? You started the fight so no bounty for them.
---
Maybe the game needs to reset or something 🤔 
---
Just for giggles, search this sub for “Ultracite power armor just showed up in my inventory.”
---
YongYea right? That guy is just a piece of **** leech that feed on negativity and other people's hard work. What's shocking to me is that so many people see this guy as the savior of the game industry but all he does is keep the fire burning until everything burned to the ground and then he moves on to the next thing that he can leech on it.
---
There must be a bug inside the nuke zones. I lost a hat I was wearing inside power armour. 
---
" Our goal is to get the content in your hands as quickly as possible so we can iterate, improve, and make any needed changes based on your feedback. "
---
We are done being your beta testers for this premature released game, stop rushing content.
---
Picture?
---
Some people like having more information and some people like less information.  Personally, I despise having to pray to the RNG gods.  I would even go for a Scrap XP system where every time we scrap an item, we get Scrap XP and materials.  The Scrap XP would be used to unlock some of the mods for each weapon and armor. 
---
Either way, listing every plan that our player knows is needed since we shouldn't have to keep track in a Word document of every plan that our character knows. 
---
So you can mod legendary effects onto weapons?
---
took them 2 months to fix the lever rifle animation...private servers is serious business
---
Broke ass 
---
They dont work without connecting them to a terminal and setting the options on what to trip on and arm them etc.
---
Even then it only seems to work once without having to re-arm it etc. Always seems like fun but then ends up being more painful then it is worth.
---
Hop over to the Whitesprings station next door and drop things there. It sees a much higher level of foot traffic.
---
Upvoting for reasonable argument.
---
But especially so for the Hook reference.
---
Played for about 10 hours today. Disconnected at least 8 times. Some in nuke zones, some just chilling in my camp, and twice trying to launch a nuke. 
---
Lol..
---
Please tell me your gamer tag. 
---
It's ok server. Let it all out. You had you little tantrum now settle down. :p
---

---
No, we're talking about the modifications like better barrels, magazines, scopes, etc. some weapons/mods have different learn chances and I'm pretty sure Radium rifles are one of the hardest, if not the hardest to unlock.
---
:( I did. but that was mostly due to my Junk extracter i had since i first built my camp
---
I agree, nice touch.
---
Sugar Grove has a bunch of clipboards (which give strings). Not sure where the best place to farm screws is though. 
---
If somebody creates a system, someone's gonna seek out a way to abuse it. Much like taxes and loopholes.
---
Yeah I can't wait for the update to hit consoles!
---
I just found the BoS chest plan while looking for excavator mods at Welch Station. So it's not just Toxic Valley.
---
There is no way to spot a duper unless its blatantly obvious such as have more then one of the same exact legendary or and obscene amount of one item (like having 1000 nuka cola's or 10000 steel on him).
---
It's not the engine's fault. It was originally an engine made specifically for MMOs. Bethesda decided to strip out the net code and then replace it with their own, shitty, networking. So, basically, Bethesda decided to do one of the dumbest fucking things possible that I learnt not to do in day one of networking class. Replacing a working, existing, solution with their own shitty implementation.
---
Are you attacking any bots at whitespring? or killing ghouls/scorch and getting the bots aggro-ed? 
---
If you own a workshop that has a Vertibird pad and you repair it. It makes a box filled with signal grenades. When thrown, the Vertibird lifts off and attacks enemies near the signal.
---
Happened to me too. The CAMP and Blue-print system is bugged big-time. I couldn't place my building then I couldn't rebuild because the old building used up too much of the budget. I had to delete the old Blue-print and scrap the old good building in storage to clear the budget and start again.  Now I stay put. You can't be as creative as you could in Fallout 4 because of that issue. It's a shame if you enjoy building.
---
No it doesn’t. The game already grinds and stutters mostly to a halt in nuke zones with more than a handful of players show up to them. 
---
4-8 player instanced dungeon type events I’d be down for though. 
---
has happened a couple times before patch but it always fixed itself within a few minutes, after the patch the server stability has been absolutely terrible and my friends list would take literally from half to a whole hour to sync after disappearing. 
---
it was so bad at one point that when discord was down for twenty mins i couldnt go to my friends’ server to tell them on the game chat that i was having connection issues because the game wouldnt let the friends list to load after i crashed and had to reboot my laptop
---
I wasn't focused on it, it was the response that was explained to me and made the most sense to me. I didn't know bobblehead effects stacked or that it was possible to do that much damage in slap.
---
Totally, I only noticed the sticker. I would have assumed it was the same size as the other because everything in the atomic shop is purely cosmetic. Also the doors at the rocket stations are the same size
---
And it wont be the last time you need em either.
---
Not an asset flip from Wolfenstein? Just making sure
---
Oh okey doke, I was excited there for a minute. Yeah I've only found one so far at level 50. But miniguns are almost everywhere
---
Servers were a mess tonight on PS4 and it doesn't have the new patch yet.
---
I want to build a big flat warehouse ish structure

Specifically, there's a plan for the combat armor.. then a mod for every other torso

I am worried about tomorrows console patch due to these reports. :/

Currently rocking this. Love it.

---
Nice job! Bethesda really does continue the tradition of licensing obscure versions of tracks. 
---
Unfortunately, Bethesda is still playing tricks again. You've got the original 1934 recording of Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" with just the piano. The one used in the Fallout games is a 2004 overdubbing with extra instruments with Vince Giordano and his Nighthawks. It was originally released on the CD It's De-Lovely - The Authentic Cole Porter Collection.
---
You do have the correct version of "Ain't Misbehavin'" which he recorded for the 1943 film Stormy Weather. Waller made way too many recordings of his signature song.
---
"Steel Guitar Rag" seems to be different from the in-game version which starts with "All 'board this train. Everybody get on. Ready? Let's go boys, take it off, Leon, take it off." The one you have matches a recording that starts with "Look out friends, here's Leon! Take it away boys, take it away!". The trouble is that the former was released on Okeh Records while the latter was released on Vocalion and Columbia which are all subsidiaries of each other as well as both versions being recorded on September 29, 1936 as Take 1 and Take 2.
---
"Riders in the Sky" also has several versions, but you seem to have the in-game one which has a lot of tambourine from 1960 instead of the 1949 one with just guitar.
---
Could you confirm if "Swinging on a Star" and "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" are still in the game? The latter actually also has several different versions as well though I can't seem to preview it right now.
---
No I didn't but maybe this week
---
Saw the video, gave it a dislike; I feel more and more like they are just using any excuse to attack 76 even if it has zero effect on the gameplay and community. If anything I think the fact that someone found a dev room to be cool; since every Bethesda title has one it's a staple. They already have a system in place for dealing with people using hacking programs and file editing to get into the space even before it was found so clearly they knew it would be eventually located. Youtubers in general are riding the hate wave right now for Bethesda; profiting from the massive amount of people who enjoy leaving nasty comments to a game they don't actually play. Remember, controversy and interest = ad revenue; it's not about giving real information from a actual player of the game.
---
I knew I was being optimistic posting literally *anything* negative in this sub but I'll try to address some of your points.
---
&gt;Sure, Bethesda bare SOME responsibility, but only in resolving the issue as quickly as they can, which they seem to be doing.
---
So you believe they have no responsibility to be proactive whatsoever?  You genuinely believe that it's a better solution for them to hunt down cheaters *after the fact* rather than to establish rules and restrictions that prevent cheating in the first place.  This shows you have very little understanding of how cheating works and how gaming companies deal with it.  There's no way you have the man-power to hunt down and punish every cheater, you control cheating by making it difficult to do in the first place.
---
&gt;Unreasonable expectation. No developer could ever stop people from finding and using exploits.
---
Except...basically every other game company developing a similar game?  I mean...duping?  Really?  This just doesn't happen anymore.  I'm not saying a game can or should be 100% locked down, but Bethesda clearly put little to no effort into creating a secure product.  There's even been information leaks.
---
&gt;It's their first multiplayer game. It's never been done by this company at all, or by any company using this engine. Once again unreasonable expectation.
---
This is not a valid excuse.  There are too many examples and games and a long history of these types of issues they could have proacitvely taken and learned from.  Multiplayer gaming is **not** a new thing.  Instead they just kinda did nothing.  It's like with the mod issue, how the community has been patching up their games for years, everyone assumed that their no mods stance means they would have stepped up and taken the responsibility of fixing their game...instead they just didn't do anything.
---
&gt;...by any company using this engine. 
---
An engine they **shouldn't** have used is not a valid excuse either.
---
&gt;Let's not blame the victim here. It's easy to because it's Bethesda and there's a TON of things you can directly blame them for. This one, not so much.
---
I don't agree at all, this is 100% your opinion that has not been backed up in any way shape or form, what kind of justification do you have for this claim?
---
&gt;Let's not pretend to diminish the responsibility of the people who hacked/exploited their way into the room.
---
I mean sure, but part of the problem is it that it's Bethesda's job to set clear rules and boundaries, if simply because no one else is capable of doing it.  Instead, they try to communicate with the community as little as possible, usually just feeding us stock-PR responses out of a binder.
---
Let me ask you this, what is the point of discussing the fault of exploiters/hackers in this example?  We does this possibly bring to the discussion?  I do think they shouldn't have done that?  Sure, but I also think it's pointless to discuss.  Saying 'cheaters are bad' doesn't have the faintest impact on their actions.  The only one who can bring change is Bethesda, and they have a responsibility to do so.  So yes, Bethesda is to blame.  
---
It's their game and their responsibility, a responsibility they have magnificently failed in just about every aspect possible.  If you recounted their failings since the release of FO76 and then took them back in time and showed them to any Bethesda fan nobody would have believed any of it yet here we are.  They are not immune to critical feedback, the negative criticisms of their actions or lack of action is warranted irregardless about how you feel about them.
---
&gt;Yong's
---
Yong and other YTs wouldn't even bother if Bethesda didn't make themselves such an easy target.
---
It’s more like a 4:1 ratio. 
---
I was just going to type something similar. At least a dozen a day.
---
Shows the expectation of players currently, almost all think its a glitch of some type.
---
I suspect that is very true yes. But then I still got some what... 30-40h of fun from 20€, I've paid more for 3 luke warm beers a summer weekend :)
---
But I'm hoping the can keep making the game better.
---
On PC I have yet to run into this but I believe you 
---
What does “roll back the server” mean?
---
That's this sub in a nutshell. Cant say anything bad about the state of the game, and if you do, you get accused of being a duper.
---
That's a great idea, but a necessary first step would be for Bethesda to make the servers stable when more than a dozen people are playing.
---
Part of the code from F4. Unable to change it due to t
---
the way the game spits out code.
---
The spot sometimes spawns a solo protectron which is NOT the vendor. The responder bot vendor has a pack Brahmin and a couple of eyebots with him.
---
That right there is the flatwoods monster, an alien, Zetan, specifically, I’ve seen it once but it teleported away, and heard it off in the distance but never saw it on another occasion, freaky shit
---
Yes, ZERO. Looting a ghoul's corpse requires more skill than TSE-ing someone.
---
And again, I am talking about an actual fight. A good example of this is the monster mash event. Lvl 40 running around with a TSE shotgun sniping you as you're running around, like wtf is up with that.
---
I just can't wait for the fireproof update to hit consoles. Y'all TSE builds will have a lot of catching up to do (skillwise) hah.
---
the reason the sub is so aggressive towards this kind of stuff is because it was teased as a child for being bad (it's not bad)
---
(Happy cake day btw )
---
Private servers do not fit the monetisation model of this game. There sadly won't be any, they'd lose revenue.
---
Well, I think at the end of the day, you should do what's fun for you. I have a 2 shot explosive Gauss, but I never use it except for queen battles. Gauss start to be so overpowered when they legendary affects that's it's almost unnecessary to use them in normal pve. This is why I love my pipe bolt, 308 rounds, not so hard to get, and pipe bolt is cheap to repair. I'd keep things like that in mind, but like I said first. You're enjoyment comes first, so if you wanna use Gauss because they look so freakin cool, you do you.
---
The other wings in WS bunker. I didn’t even see the scientific wing or med bay!
---
Nope ur just playing the Air-base!
---
https://giant.gfycat.com/AgedEllipticalAnophelesmosquito.webm
---
I would kill for an uninterrupted 30 minutes at this point. I got stuck in WS. Kept crashing to desktop upon entering the world. Then I'd finally get in and try to run away or fast travel out of WS and CRASH.
---
It happens near WS a LOT. It happens near the Queen a LOT. it happens out in the world when I look at my inventory or sell to a vendor or craft. this game is unplayable right now and all my buddies are going elsewhere. I need a new game...
---
&gt;Edit: dafuq did this get downvoted for?
---
Probably the downvote brigade who plague the sub. It's really an infestation at this point.
---
Some idiots think its their obligation to take care od dupers. Its funny to look at. 
---
Here’s a post where the author compares sledgehammer mods (including anti-armor mods) and concludes that with incisor 3 the anti-armor mods don’t do anything extra.  So, it’s possible there’s a maximum amount of anti-armor such that the legendary effects also don’t do anything extra:
---
/r/fo76/comments/a3olmm/antiarmor_sledgehammer_and_normal_sledgehammer/
---
Exactly!
---
Only thing i want from private servers is the ability to get my full Crew together for queen fights. This would also need PSN to give us a larger party size. Right now its a frustrating process of 4-12 players, depending on the night, server hopping to find an "Empty" server for everyone to join. Honestly a way to spawn a "fresh" server and send invites to my friends before it opens to the full public would be amazing.
---
guess i’ll give it a try next time i launch a nuke, thanks for the tip.
---
Where did you place your camp? I have the supplies to build one of those, and its not like im gonna be doing other things with it
---
Most people on this god forsaken platform are so toxic than rather than help others understand a situation, they'd shit all over people for trying to understand that situation. This whole website is the self proclaimed front page of the internet and as a result is just the easiest place for idiots to congregate en masse and force everyone else out. If you stay on Reddit too long you adapt to the Reddit mindset of "follow the horde". It's an issue with Reddit and the wacko authoritarian people who are on here. 
---
quite the opposite actually (although I still think it's bad)
---
Regarding your example of rumors.
---
This was in the latest patch notes:
---
" **Trade:** We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade. "
---
Seems like there was something to that rumor if they somewhat address it in the patch notes.
---
I agree with you however that we should not jump to quickly to conclusions.
---
I just got rolled back while passing through the forest. I was at Bolton Greens and the event popped up. Tried to head in at the gates and I started getting lag and then **_BAM_** d/c. 
---
When I start back up I’m at Greg’s Mine Supply on the road approaching from the south. Two entirely different spawns. 
---
I can't pull it from work but It's straight north of the fair grounds has a junk pile and a Bee Hive
---
That the “Kill a Wendingo in a clown suit” quest does not award caps will reappear upon completion. Spent three hours looking for a clown suit to complete it. 
---
relax, its a known issue, it'll get fixed, but no need to blow a fuse over it
---
Wait so it doesn't award anything?
---
ooooHHHHHhh, THAT explains what happened. I noticed after getting disconnected I had stuff in my bags that I'd dropped or sold not long before being disconnected. Maybe this could also be causing the severe lag, or maybe that's the game connecting me to American servers instead of Australian ones. 30-60s average load time for the laggy servers, 5-10s load time for proper not broken server.
---
The Brahmin Pen is the fertilizer resource thingy. I was expecting the tub from fallout 4 and some fencing or something. Kept finding the plans and it wouldn't let me use it, figured it was bugged like some of the other plans.
---
Wow this games a fucking train wreck. I can’t see new players ever wanting to join this shit excuse for a fallout game. Every trending post I see from this sub has to do with a new problem that needs to be fixed.
---
I’m not going to risk getting my account banned as I don’t care to dupe but if it’s out in the open Bethesda can’t hide from it and up goes the urgency to fix it
---
In Fallout 4 the maximum useful amount of anti-armor depended on the damage. Below 0.15x damage, damage resistance has no effect. So for example if you had a 200 damage attack, it doesn't matter whether the target has 20 or 30 DR.
---
Fallout 76 probably has a similar formula, but the details aren't known yet.
---
So tried it aswell last night. Output went up to 75% I could swear I had 50% once aswell. No blooming afterwards. Thanks for trying too. I don't know if the blooms stay active way after you completed the heart of the swamp quest. If so it might have been the reason for blooming. I did that quest like several hours before finding the blooms though. Als I would like to know if its possible that the quest did not show up even though I was in the mire. It might have been there but just waiting just out of reach.
---
Anyway can't pinpoint what made it bloom. Also what is the use of the dam output terminal? Just a idle leftover from a quest?
---
GoofyOnSafari 
---
No clue, I've been wanted all of three times and each time is as far as I know, due to a bug...I'm wanted right now because I completed a quest that had me pick a lock. 
---
Oh shit you mean like if I went and picked up junk for hours and hours and then waddled myself to a crafting station and hit 'scrap all'... damn. In that case a character really should not be allowed to carry unlimited items!
---
I've sat around my camp for a literal hour idling and had less than five per as a test.
---
Restarts the server from its last safe point, in which you have your items
---
How did you get free just disconnected?  Fast travel?
---
I posted about this a while back. I lost 3 mods while quickly crafting ammo. What's worse is that it actually prioritizes scrapping your mods over bulked items. So its deliberate, someone coded that chain into the game. Check loose, check mods, check bulk. HA! Ridiculous.  :)
---
Compound Bows are listed in the files but have yet to surface in game. Unsure if they plan to add in a future dlc or update.
---
Sometimes specific servers get shut down. Have you tried rejoining? It should pop you into a working one. 
---
Can people stop talking about server instability when the games servers itself are legit trash cans, blows my actual mind that people still think this game is AAA lmao. 
---
Oh shit, at the start of the game i used my steel to gain exp since i had no use for the steel early on.
---
By crafting a lot of throwing knives, scraping it and craft again.
---
I had no idea that lag effected the whole server. i thought it was only for me.
---
Honestly though it should have been fixed before or within the first week of release. I 100% understand what he is talking about. All those hours wasted in his life, just to have to do that all over again.  
---
Well that made a lot of sense. Thank you for enlightening me.
---
Interested in the calibrated shocks for left and right leg on Ultracite.  message me when a  good time to meet up is. 
---
shoulda coulda woulda, point is, its a game, no point getting absolutely worked up over it, is it annoying, sure is, is it the end of the world, no.
---
Sugar grove for clipboards, &amp; some desk fans. Look for office complexes for desk fans for screws
---
Right, I didn’t mean modding SF, but crafting a different piece; but if SF has a unique effect, I’ll stick with it. 
---
Channeling a little bid of MODUS at the end there, eh?
---
Oops I think you're right
---
PC? I’d like to visit your camp 
---
Excellent, thanks for the info. I guess I’ll stick with it then. 
---
Thanks. Clapping your base up every chance I get. 
---
those are both the same thing.
---
all this did was stop people Tom looking at someone I ventory if they didn't agree to the trade.
---
trade stealing was never actually a thing that existed. there is absolutely no proof of it existing anywhere. literally no one was able to replicate it.
---
That the inside of white springs has vendors lmao (literally found this out a few days ago)
---
With the way the story is set we get to sample all of the different factions. That being said a faction based expansion is highly probable. The Brotherhood, EnclaveI, Free States, and Raiders would be the main four while the others would be secondary factions. I just hope there is a drifter/wanderer faction. 
---
Nice find!
---
That explains why I can't be in a server longer than 15 minutes without disconnecting without warning.
---
It baffles me that upon all the rocky terrain this game sits on, people will do this to the innocent players just trying to enjoy themselves. Though, I suppose maybe that's their intent because if you hate something, why allow anyone else to enjoy it themselves, right?
---
Keep defending these changes...
---
It’s been a common issue with tamed pets. Best advice I can give you is to restart the game or store random stuff. I just stored stuff then dropped it back and it worked 
---
The system isnt quite that simple, comes down to the keywords of items.
---
Mods, bulk and junk are all misc items with specific keywords controlling certain things, and its these keywords that the system would be looking to to figure out what to use, unfortunately the system seems to take mods either due to a keyword or the absence of a keyword
---
THE GAME IS UNPLAYABLE, literally, for me and a few others on my discord. CONSTANT disconnects. Sometimes we can't even get into a world before CTD. 
---
I'm all for LOCKING items in your inventory.  LOCKED items cannot be dropped, scrapped, sold, or traded.  The only way to get them out of your inventory would be to UNLOCK them.
---
Wouldn't the fanboys be the ones to enjoy it despite those issues? It might be too late at night but I'm not really following here
---
Can confirm. There is a dumping method very few select people know of. There is even a sort of dark-net for fallout 76 stuff 
---
Must’ve been the wind.
---
that if you drink from the sulphur water fountain at the gazebo at whitesrings it cures diseases i am lvl 215 just found this out the other day lol
---
Nope, no vendor will buy ammo and the only "safe" container in the game atm is your stash box. You could dump all your ammo onto another alt character but imo just drop it off in the cash register at Morgantown. That way a lower leveled character might find it and make some use of it or you could try posting in one of the trading subs for caps or just to give away. 
---
I dont think they will ever make ammo sellable but they may make it scrapable for lead, gunpowder and steel. Though, it would make ammo hoarding even easier. I have friends that use .38, .50, etc so I give to them, drop the rest if I cant sell it.
---
I keep saying this...I can sit there, with a bank of fully powered purifiers, for more than an hour and have 1-4 in each. 
---
These things are either _bugged_ or bethesda _needs_ to change the description text to reflect that this is planned and not a bug. 
---
whitesprings resort, whitesprings bunker and sugar grove are good for both
---
Sure add PSN: dlimbillion 
---
You handled this very well, kudos to you.
---
Grahm and the "unfactioned" vendor in watoga share caps. Seems like an unnamed faction for travelling merchants with watoga station being a fixed place you can get those caps on days where you can't find the travelling vendors. There's an ultra rare responders vendor, also sharing those same caps, who spawns near Charleston train station sometimes.
---
I've been trying to do the training exercises at Camp McClintock for over an hour. I get through, have been awarded XP but when it comes to finishing the live fire portion, immediately after completion I get "Disconnected from Server" 
---
I have to server hop to find one where the voucher for the fatigues is still present in the barracks so I can trigger it again. has happened 8 times, maybe 9th's the charm, but I doubt it
---
You obviously don't understand. its not about it being a game. its about that that's time i spent in my life, that i'll NEVER get back, wasted. it doesn't matter if its a game, if it's a business lunch, or if its plans with a friend. ITS ABOUT THE TIME I TOOK OUT OF MY LIFE THAT COULDA BEEN USED FOR ANYTHING ELSE. It's just such a common courtesy thing to not fucking waste someones time. Time is the most valuable and fleeting thing we have in this life. so don't fucking patronize me when you entirely miss the point. 
---
I loathe spending twenty seconds swapping out just to loot a container and there's no way in hell i'm running with that when I could have a card that actively benefits DPS and survivability in combat. 
---
Um...ok?  I’ve already established that destroying one’s base seems rather irrelevant at this point based on the flawed game design.  Likewise, killing a player has become equally irrelevant in my eyes.  As long as you don’t fight back, there no consequences.  
---
Damn I must be pretty darn lucky then, havent had a server crash (or disconnect from server message) since the new patch, not even a server is not responding popup.
---
Jesus Christ, ok we got it and Bethesda already said there are working on it. 
---
No need to create a thousand posts about it for some karma whoring.
---
Guess I should hop on now then ?
---
Thanks, I have 4 stack and we all try to use 2 different types of ammo each to avoid this. But no one uses every ammo type and my higher lvl character had a lot of some of the weirder and rare ammo types.
---
I played little over 100 hours and plan to come back. Server crashes got to me but it's better now I hear. I'm doing a full fo4 play thur with the dlcs atm lol. 
---
I do understand, if u get this worked up about a game, take a break, do something else, its not healthy.
---
All rng, some people get max level TSE weapons at level 5. I've played since beta and have only found 1 TSE weapon as loot
---
I’m sorry you’re being downvoted by these cringey Bethesda fanboys. If you’re not here to be willingly buttfucked by Bethesda, you don’t belong. 
---
Why is it funny

Thanks for the intput, its really appreciated! I've just edited the playlist to include the correct version of Steel Guitar Rag. I dont think Spotify has the correct version of Anything Goes, but I'll keep looking. As for Swinging on a Star and Tumbling Tumbleweeds, i based my playlist off of [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uuoy5/full_list_of_the_fallout_76_appalachia_radio/) which i took to be accurate and reference Tumbling Tumbleweed from [this video](https://youtu.be/seHS7EGJTG0?list=PLd1PqD1daVpSYto94v_8LzOqa3h7lOHOy) specifically. I actually used the playlist that video is from to cross reference most of the songs.
---
Thanks for your reply. That's just what I said in my post, replying to the user who said anyone with such an item will be banned. 
---
The dry lakebed to the east of Charleston is flat and has water access. Just north of Flatwoods on off the road is a nice build area as well.
---
That what someone says when they're trying to steal. 
---
Only just found Whitespring have a vendor sells different unique nuka cola flavors (not quantum or cherry) upstairs and if you sit at a table in a restaurant then a robot comes over and opens a trading menu for food.
---
Yeah I actually noticed a crew of 3 duping on a server last night. At first I thought they were buddies and then I noticed something was up. Then I started to get heavy lag and eventually disconnected. This must have been that
---
Yeah, mods have a connection to junk that needs to be severed. When you press the button to store all junk in your stash it also stores any mods in your inventory. You could speculate that the mods are classified as junk because they arent the same standalone objects like they were in fallout 4. They could just bring back the fo4 mod system and that would fix the problem. Or they could label all mods as crafting components like they do with beer bottles.
---
Yup everytime I go I try to buy all the grape and orange.
---
I dont even know how to do that i was just being nice.
---
Thanks! Gonna check it out

Never bulk your wood and steel!

You're welcome, but I fear that this is too little too late if this post is already #1 trending with almost 2000 points. Somehow my initial comment from being decently upvoted to decently downvoted. While I don't care about internet points, pretty much nobody is going to see the response all the way down here. I may make a bigger post about all this with linked posts and references if more threads like this keep popping up
---
I have heard this but I still have not seen it. There is a gazebo near the golf club house which seems like it would fit the description but I dont see any water and dont have any drink options. Am I looking at the wrong place?!?
---
Doesn't take away from the fact that it was all funny 
---
Yea got him after about 50 resets 
---
I'm roleplaying as a raider with raider gear and power armor; these chumps are lies. Also don't need to be a griefer to be considered a raider, most raiders would only go after stuff for money; destroying a camp doesn't get anybody squat.
---
Yeah, good call. It's like the whole point of the game is to stop the scorched by nuking fissure prime. So, you do that, and now what? Nothing changed. Sure, you have Prime weapons and other anti-scorched weapons but they all just keep spawning as if nothing has changed. Also, the fissure doesn't close once nuked. I get that this would be difficult to implement due to the online nature of the game, but at least include an explanation in the lore as to why it really didn't work.
---
No idea that was a thing, only read about it here recently.
---
Yup. Lot of that going around here. 
---
The grapes are totally worth the 20 or so caps they cost.
---
What do you mean you haven’t seen Nerd Rage! perk card? When you level up you can select each card under each SPECIAL category given you have met the level requirement
---
Complete RNG. I'm working on a list gathering data on drop rates, but at the rate of some of this stuff it may take months to have enough to make any reliable conclusions. At about 200 hours in game I have only found two explosive weapons (one being TSE) and zero sentinel/cavalier armor. 
---
I accidentally duped an item today while farming around watoga with a friend this evening.  Apparently you can do it with only two people, although I'm not really sure how it happened.  If anyone from Bethesda reads this, I'll be happy to explain the specific circumstances in private, and I did not do it intentionally.
---
Thanks, definitely bookmarking that!
---
Any idea the best place to look for these plans?
---
They can downvoted all they want, it doesn't change what is true. I'm level 245, so I've volunteered to get buttfucked. Still doesn't change the fact that private servers won't happen for as long as the atomic shop is a thing.
---
The first season of True Detective makes most crime dramas look like amateur hour.
---
Wow your angry over a video game.
---
Since I'm there, a quick walk through the Whitespring shops netted me 8 screws and 7 springs. There's a lot of clipboards around, a globe in the hairdressers', a giddyup buttercup and toy truck in the toy store, and the rest probably came from the trash cans.
---
I have gotten very few myself.  Maybe twice in 24 hours.
---
That is different than taking items from another's inventory.  All that means is that the "tradee" had marked an item with a price and was available to trade.  The "trader" selected the object, put the price and finialized the trade without the "tradee" agreeing.   The "Tradee" had to put a price on the object first.  Much different than the rumor of the inventory steal.
---
Tldr don't be stupid when making camps.
---
Same here, I've had several rollbacks in the last 48h, never happened before.
---
Same thing happening to me since just 2 days ago or so in my excavator PA.
---
Uh they already said they will be along with private servers this year. And they have always supported mods for all their games.
---
Sure 
---
Never said they would come. I simply said you misquoted it to Todd. Pete Hines was the one who said that private servers were coming.
---
Eventually you will want everything at max level.
---
There is no endgame to keep me playing

There is also a randome encounter now with a crashed cargo-bot that has shared loot. found 3 of them yesterday within 30 minutes.

Preach it brother man!

Happy cake day btw.
---
I think so
---
Aw well keep it up ! Kill em all
---
Ok I'll give that a go. I did rebuild my whole camp though and was still left with 10% . I'm really hoping it fixes itself while I'm at work tomorrow so I can try to tame something smaller like a mirelurk king or something.
---
Just started the BoS quest line haha, thanks!
---
yes in that gazebo there is a drinking fountain  it will say sulphur fountain
---
Any recent examples where other multiplayer game dev rooms can be accessed and exploited? 
---
If not - why other MP games were not hacked into to access all the content? Maybe those devs assigned account restrictions in the first place for whomever enters them without Admin/GM rights? It's really isn't that hard. 
---
&gt;Except...basically every other game company developing a similar game? **I mean...duping? Really? This just doesn't happen anymore.** I'm not saying a game can or should be 100% locked down, but Bethesda clearly put little to no effort into creating a secure product. There's even been information leaks.

LOL! Ludicrous even as hyperbole.
---
I have one on PS4. I’ll prob end up selling it once player vending becomes a thing. I almost never use power armor.
---
&gt;My description of the method is purposely vague
---
If everyone does the "glitch" then Bethesda will have absolutely no choice BUT to patch it first and foremost.
---
That is a name I've not heard in a long long time, almost as old as MU 
---
I've been collecting outfits for 300 hours, and now discovered that there are a 100 more of which i never heard.
---
Will have to spend another 100 hours farming them.
---
Hola crafter!
---
I rolled Tesla. gave him some wild hair, used first 15 levels to get to 15 intelligence as it gives you longer durability bars on the weapons and armor you make.
---
Was surprised to learn that all hacking attempts have only 4 options when you have 15 int, who would think Bethesda would add such a tiny detail?
---
As you continue to level up, take the core crafting perk cards, as they have 5 ranks each meaning you have a low chance of getting them maxxed from opening Perk Packs. Hurts to take craft cards but discipline.
---
In addition to Science, Makeshift Warrior, Armoer, and Gunsmith, you will want to max Demolitions Expert as well, another 5 bloody cards :( the recipes for grenades are pretty sweet, and this perk lets them, do more damage, and you will have so very many grenades of all types! 
---
For gameplay, you will use all your mats to create things, getting mods when you scrap armor and weapons. Combine this with taking workshops and your recipe book will fill fast.
---
Do a run to Sutton railroad station for the Raider Vendor Bot, then head south to the Charleston one for some more caps. I originally planned on having 3\* hard Bargain, but you make so much stuff that getting all the vendor caps cleared out is super easy. Unlocking other vendors, like Whitesprings, should be done as soon as you can safely do so. Save caps by not buying weapon mods plans, instead buy only base weapon plans and all Power Armor mod plans.
---
After 15 int, you will want some base SPECIAL stats, depending on how you want to interpret crafting. I bought Contractor 2\* and Home Defense 3\* because I consider them technical crafting, though not at a workbench :)
---
I strongly recommend Can Do, Scrounger, and Pharma Farmer, all in Luck tree. They allow you to search containers for extra loot, I didnt care for them until this crafter run, they give me so much extra loot that I can sell drugs/food to the vendorbots exclusively, clearing their caps. So much extra loot and I only have them at 2\* each, cos my 6 luck.
---
In Strength, I took perks that lowered weight of guns, Scattershot for shotguns and Bear Arms for heavy Weapons. I find crafting miniguns just to break them down costs too much in springs and screws, so is not a good way to get minigun mods, so finding them in the wild and being able to fast travel to my workbenches is key.
---
Make all your extra common mats into simple melee weapons. All my wood, rubber, plastic, and steel get used this way. Even after getting mods from breaking them down, the XP is too good. Use beds for extra XP, use instruments for AP buff as well. Don't waste springs/screws/nuclear materials to make XP practice weapons, the mats are too rare.
---
Farm CAMP veggies for Starch/Adhesive, you will need them for grenades and mines. Bottles dont autoscrap so you should turn them all into Molotovs with oil. Circuitry can make cryogenic grenades, your Nuka Cola can turn into Nuka grenades. A brahmin pen will give you all the fertilizer you need, adhesives are the real bottleneck.
---
Hope this helps, I was suprpised how much fun I had with this combat-gimped toon! I plan to run him to 50 and use only gatling lasers for ScorchBeast offense :)
---
I believe all the PA types can use this. It is a torso mod. 
---
I also believe that when it has no specific PA designation in the title it means you can apply the mod to any acceptable PA piece (again, being a torso mod in this case). 
---
Rail way rifle is fairly beastly ,also seems to stagger without perks as well.
---
Vlad and Mia, two robots that just endlessly ask each other questions. Before I saw them but could hear them I thought it was other players talking to each other and they just left their microphones on but nobody was on the map.
---
I am sure other people have seen them, I just havent seen them mentioned anywhere here.
---
Well that's fucking dumb.
---
Yea, I wish I could. I've tried to learn french a few times.
---
Could be an MG3 too. They’re basically identical.
---
You can't gaurenteed legendaries will spawn. I know a location gaurenteed to spawn a deathclaw and some ants but the deathclaw is almost never legendary.
---
Legendaries aren't gaurenteed most of the time unless you are really high level and no low level players are around
---
I freaked out because I thought I saw a UFO at a prime site during a nuke but it turned out to just be a meat pile that was floating in the air....
---
Commenters before has a link to the math bits but the tl;dr version is if you've got an anti-armor legendary effect on top of the fire axe spikes mod you're pretty much free to drop incisor for something else. I'd go max weapon damage perks/martial artist/blocker personally. 
---
Yeah speed demon and ps4. I'm trying to make a speed build like mine in Fallout 4 but it's not that easy. There you got legendary Armour with +10%move speed.
---
So at least I have to take char perk with +20%team speed, agi perk gun runner with 20% move speed while pistol is equipped. Speed demon as well and maybe Agi perk death man sprinting 🤔
---
Fireproof Lvl 3 post update gives like 45% explosive resist and I guess with the "dense" chest piece mod pretty much drops it to zero explosive damage received
---
Sounds like someone trying to farm Karma.
---
Yea, but ghouls don't drop guns, so far as I can tell, just armor and melee weapons.
---
Thanks for the clarification.  
---
Was wondering what the notes were referring to, if not that rumor.
---
Hacker 3 to turn off the turrets in each room and long-barreled shotgun with Enforcer 3 is my go-to as a solo player. Silos are a breeze for me. Blast the legs off the assaultrons then shoot their head lasers while they’re crawling around. I can disable those things in just a few seconds with just a regular pump shotgun.
---
My experience has been mixed. A lot of the times I've tried, it didn't work and there was no indication anyone was even remotely in the area.
---
My gut feeling says that even the items out in the world not in containers is instance to you. Don't know for certain but it feels that way.
---
That disconnect is different than maintenance. I would hit up bethesda support for your issue. I have no idea what's going on there. 
---
I just buy the Nuka Cola so I can turn them into grenades, sweet sweet nuka grenades...
---
If your on pc bro we have a mod that stops it and its a ba2 file so all good.
---
And this is the end result of all the “harmless” duping. The mythic tier weapons that should be super rare are *everywhere* and It’s ruined a large aspect of the game.  
---
I nuked Harpers Ferry tonight and it was awesome until the duped gear squad inevitably rolled in, you know, TSE shotguns, all the good mutations, and now they all have this garbage at 50, 60, 70 instead of in the 100’s. It was just upsetting to be a legit drop only player in the mid 100’s that was having people in their 50’s hopping rooftops trashing all the mobs before I could even see them. 
---
10 ghouls killed.  4 or 5 have US reqisitions holotapes
---
How to use criticals. Really wish I had known this earlier 
---
It's probably because your system can't handle the game because it's plugged up with other crap left in there that doesn't get played anymore
---
Or you internet
---
I'm not getting any DC.   Its much more stable than ever has been for me.
---
Mhmm nothing in the world can't be solved with the proper amount of nuka grenades.
---
Hey man fellow aussie here, I play on pc &amp; xbox, always up for a game. Bethesda.net username is DeepFriedSmurf, Xbox gamertag TheFriedSmurf
---
I sincerely hope it's vending machines inside whitesprings or some other central location.
---
Why?
---
1. If it's at your camp, you have to show your camp to other players on the map, or place it somewhere with lots of traffic anyways, like Whitesprings.  If players want to be dicks, or just don't like your prices......they're going to smash up your vending machines, change servers, and have their buddy collect the bounty.  We'll get 1,000,000 "my vending machine got smashed wah wah wah posts".
---
2. I'm not travelling all over the map to see what people put in their vending machines.  About the third time I see a vending machine filled with pipe pistols, .38 ammo, and spoiled food...........I'm going to stop coming to your vending machines.  I can get exactly what I want for less hassle on FO76 Market Reddit right now.

Man I always loved the radium rifle!
---
Are you on PC?
---
Yeah, i can.
---
What did you file the support ticket under? I also bought something on accident from the shop but there doesn't seem to be an Atomic Shop Refund section, only a section for feedback. What did you use?
---
Likely unintended. No need to be drama queens about it. Thanks OP for bringing it to our (and Bethesda's) attention.
---
Where to get Excavator PA. Just never came up in natural game play.
---
I'm not on Xbox at the moment, but I'm sure you can Google it. It's literally called "flight helmet" 
---
I’m on ps4 but no mic. I’ve played enough that I can do the silos by myself without a problem but I’m down for whatever.
---
The kiloton radium rifle is ridiculous with the right perks and upgrades.  i dont think i have all the perks for it and it does \~250 damage a shot ( 137 balistic, 100 radiation, 15 exploding bullets) and has a 40 round clip. its not sniper rifle great for range but you can snipe and spray a bit because it uses .45's. 
---
not getting hit, they may shoot in ur general direction if your caution, but u just move around a bit, they keep shooting at where u were, so u can keep picking them off one by one. 
---
But the real big advantage is just being able to stealth right past Scorchbeasts, havent had to take one on yet, even when they have landed right next to me, i just stealth away.
---
No but you just knicked the dupers hard day of work from them.
---
Good post. The botched launch, duping and the devs room items seem to have turned parts of the community for the worse. Some people may want to take a less toxic attitude in what is slowly turning into an echo chamber.
---
PC?
---
I'm still amazed how much in finding. There's just so much to do and see!
---
Lol! Wait wait lemme try! \*clears throat\* Anti armor legendary effect combined with Rank 3 incision ignores precisely 92.7333... repeating of course... percent of the targets armor. Now who do you believe...?
---
Camp McClintock has 25-30 clipboards if it’s untouched by another player...
---
We're so lucky no one gives a shit about your suggestions.
---
Only says edit... What did it say?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I don’t have this card ... 
---
Stability for me is Significantly worse post patch, I used to get (if lucky on the server) 5 hours no CTDs..now I'm lucky if I get 30 minutes without a hard app crash 
---
I've scrapped hundreds of metal legs and I just can't seem to get that mod.  I also can't get shadowed mods for leather armor, no matter how many pieces I craft and scrap.
---
I use everything heavily and I wouldn't keep more than 150 gears and springs around, that's plenty for day-to-day things.   
---
If you're planning to mass craft something, then make sure you've got super duper rank 3 then write down the materials you need to complete your project and farm it out if need be.    
---
Avoid hoarding as it will just make the game suck, the point is to keep things scarce so you can   
---
A. run and fast travel freely    
---
B. have space to store things you really want to keep    
---
C. have something to do other than sit around looking at your treasures    
---
Scarcity keeps you going, looking for new areas and methods to farm more efficiently, and discovering new situations and experiences along the way.    
---
Contractor will save materials on building, White Knight makes armor repairs cheap af, Power Patcher for power armor repairs, and Fix it Good/Weapon Artisan will make weapons and armor twice as durable while repairing- all must have perks which drastically reduce your junk needs.    
---
Another tip you may not know is to switch to component view in your pipboy's junk tab and mark certain components for search, this way anytime you see a piece of junk in the world, you can tell if it has something you're looking for because it will have a little magnifying glass next to it's name.
---
Even in the card pool
---
Agreed.    Never been PK'd at all in my 200+ hours on the game in PC.  Yet the guy on PS4 said he "cannot do anything without getting pk'd constantly".
---
I had one person TRY to kill me right after nuke zone when I had 10% life left and almost full radiation.  He sniped me from long range and all I had to do was get rid of radiation and drink a nuka.  Thats it.  He could not do a thing beyond that.
---
Np
---
Then don't just watch the build video. The rest just provide more information on how to correctly play the build. It's to much to try to explain. The build video it self is like 10mins. 
---
West Virginian here - WV actually doesn't have too many log cabins nor does it have a big history for them. There are a few at resorts and ski lodges like Canaan Valley and Timberline, but they're more of a modern attraction than they are a historical landmark.
---
That's more of a thing out west, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, places like that have a strong history for log cabins.
---
Just remember it does not matter what perks you take. You can even move points you place around after level 50.
---
Dont worry you will eventually have multiple builds set up when you get into the 100-300 area.
---
Bethesda didn't screw that guy over, but you did. Great job! Just make sure to get rid of it before they ban you for having a suspicious amount of carryweight. 
---
Stealth is just real good for normal gameplay. Like solo or just doing normal stuff. The only problem is that usually in a stealth build ur not so great is boss fights considering all your stealth perks are in agility which literally only affects stealth.
---
My character is usually overencumbered because I have a hoarding mentality in 76. Had one of those anti duper guys try and kill me. (I don't even know how to do that stuff) if my lvl 160 friend hadn't seen my distress call. I would have been roasted. Dude contacted me all pissed off. Ranting about how because I'm over capacity I must be a duper. And to watch my back "because next time "big daddy" won't save you..." He did not try anything since he ragequit the server.
---
TL:DR just because someone is over capacity. Does not mean they are duping. And always carry a flare gun if you plan on playing with friends.
---
You may want to add in one of the community mods like u/lonevaultwanderer. I think there are a couple of others too.
---
Nice work! Fighting the good fight :)
---
Most Bethesda games have a dev room. In 76, it was an accident leftover from thinking about making a single player game like skyrim and fallout 4
---
It was not easy to get to from what I've heard. All unreleased items are being tracked (but ones that do exist can't be tracked cuz it's basically just a dupe)
---
YouTube lately has been filled with a lot of hate on 76. Most youtubers pathetically make bad videos about it, and for some reason long videos that don't really get to the point or make sense have been a trend lately.
---
Bethesda is handling it by basically tempt banning anyone who enters (because obviously this has to be done intentionally) and asking for an apology to cheating before you can continue playing
---
There’s a disease that stops ap regen. Also power armour seems to bug it sometimes

All of this is pure truth
---
So? At this point you cant tell anymore and they flooded the market it doesnt matter anymore economy is dead. Games fucked.
---
*sharpens pitchfork and uses 5,000 boards for torches* 
---
What guns do you guys use? As a stealth build are long range weapons the go to over say, an assassin  pistol stealth build?
---
If you still know who they are, maybe consider reporting them?
---
It may not end up being anything in terms of being a duper/exploiter but that's Bethesda's problem to sort out.
---
It wasn't really that easy to get in this one they basically had to fully hack the game and if you been keeping track anyone who goes in that room gets banned and the items gey removed from everyone inventory but apparently it's also Bethesda's fault that these hackers are trying to sell these items for real world money 
---
That would be so rad if we were on the same server and could almost wave to each other from our front doors.  Howdy neighbor!

I have noticed I can fall farther before tripping the 'superhero landing' in power armor with bird bones. Without bird bones I can jump with Marsupial on mostly level ground and still trigger the superhero landing.
---
So am I! 
---
Thanks man. You did good today :)
---
I'm weirdly happy to hear this. I'd never done workshops before, but I need certain materials in abundance so I gave two of them a try in the last 24 hours. Both times, I DC'd while setting them up. I thought workshops were bugged, sounds like it's just these numbnuts.
---
That's amazing! 
---
Don't grind, don't farm, don't rush, take time to read the stories, explore the world, feel the moods.
---
Just what happens when a server crashes for any reason, which is fine until it’s used to dupe
---
Maybe something like the robot builder in fo4
---
True that, I guess I got a little impatient lol, and only got to level 29 before restarting. But I am really enjoying this with a little more patience and a much more open mind. 
---
Pick up useless weapons and scrap them to learn  new upgrades for a gun. They also give off some good loot. 
---
Wait until the game is "fixed"
---
Has any one confirmed the ban ? I know patch releases for pc 
---
Yeah but you shouldn't be able to willingly crash a server repeatedly.
---
It will be realy helpfull, thanks. More of us, sooner they will fix this.
---
I'll do that immediately,  she also dropped a two shot explosive round 10mm submachine gun...  I'll keep it tho because I heard it rare. She said through message a random person gave it all to me
---
I call BS on you friends story. 
---
Pistols can be a bit lackluster, unless you go some weird gunslinger build.. Rifles seems to be where it's at!
---
Definitely not, but people try EVERYTHING 
---
I think if you put into account that you want bigger baddies and maybe something "controlling" the sbq you have to believe she was just a pawn in the bigger scheme. Sort of like a scapegoat for the bigger baddies. Have someone to take the fall while they still work from the background and the story continues
---
They better do. I need my daily dosis
---
The plan can be bought in Harpers ferry, while mods spawn all around the world as pickable objects, you need to find a spot and server hop hundreds of times, or buy one from players. Easiest way is to buy both the plan and a legendary combat armor
---
I find herds of Radstags up in the Toxic Valley regularly.
---
Shadowed leather may not be a scrap mod. Girded, Treated and Studded are, IIRC.
---
Muffled metal's in the scrap list, although I can't guarantee it's not glitched because I don't have it either. When you're down to a handful of mods, the chances of unlocking anything are extremely low.
---
I feel like a lot of people did the opposite of what you're suggesting and ended up getting bored. Great suggestion!
---
Nukesdragons.com has a character builder which will give you a guide of what cards to get when, based on your build.
---
It's a great idea in general. I once found the cooler behind Morgantown Station full of plans and ammo somebody had left there. Helped myself and put stuff in I had extra.
---
I'm trying to leave these little surprises everywhere now. 
---
people love to feel self-righteous.
---
Definitely can be fun just wanted to make sure to let ya know. Just incase seen alot of new lads believe they were stuck and had to restart.
---
This is the best screenshot in this game I ever saw.
---
I’d prefer sentrybot as a carrier
---
It's no problem I just dropped it on the ground and leat the server
---
What clothing items were taken that arent in the game yet?
---
Maybe there are people who don't read r/fo76. the whole day.  
---
Omg I just said leat I mean left
---
You dont need the codes (get them from the website), you do need to collect the nuclear key cards to put in the machine but they dont expire.
---
The carryweight I had was 47582. For about 3 minutes
---
Should of taken it to a new server and dumped it in a lake lol.
---
Dupers are scum of the earth and deserve 0 pity from the community.
---
Nope. I don't have a single explosive or two-shot, much less one with both combined.   I am assuming there was 5-10 legit based on what I personally saw in my own drops.
---
Can i reset my perks etc?
---
Isn't the result different because the cheater reconnect to the SAME server, putting more stress into it, while most players will reconnect to a new server?
---
I'm now getting a new bug where game is working, but there is no sound and everything except UI is pitch black. Only restarting the game helps.
---
Containers are per person for sure, but I’ve had it many times where I’m hunting plans and someone grabs it in front of my eyes lol
---
Take the game slow. Power levelling just rushes you to an abrupt crawl.
---
Explore everything in an area before moving on. Not just for loot and story but also slows you down enough that you'll be strong enough to take on higher level areas when they naturally come into view.
---
Read and listen to everything. Not all terminals and notes are great but some give awesome context and backstory to come epic storylines.
---
Keep only what you need in the moment or maybe an item you can use in a level or 2. You'll find more items equal or better when you do get to a level you can use it.
---
Run if you need to. Better to be alive than potentially waste time getting back your junk, or worse still, losing it with a server crash/disconnect.
---
Please check my post history...
---
I've been tracking bugs since the beta,'and started doing monthly round ups of issues etc, started to notice the trend of the RNG oddness early last month when one of them looted a dozen two shots I pulled 8+ anti-armor (1*'s) weapons in 3 or 4 hours in WhiteSprings...
---
Since then I've seen the same behavior with treasure maps, vendor hopping, etc.
---
Trying to collect enough maps for a couple locations to do more controlled testing.
---
I think splash damage may be the culprit most of the time,  and thats when the robots doing lunge toward my bullets like its candy then get mad at me when they get hit :(
---
Sounds like a joke only a duper would make.
---
/s
---
You should be good to go then. 
---
What an ignorant comment
---
Even if it was only available in the Atomic Shop, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.
---
Happy cake day! Also I believe it's 20% but I could be wrong. 
---
Also shortcuts for stimpack tends to first use weakest healing thing you have, died few times cause it used healing salva/diluted beach instead of super stimpak. 
---
do this with the speed demon mutation. check out my mutation guide, if your build is focused on just 1 unique design concept you can pretty much get yourself the mutation by using my guide
---
Have this, it even puts the clan names under their player names on the map. Really awesome.
---
They also dropped a two shot armor explosive shot 10mm submachine gun off the bag and I keep it because....  Well u can't blame me it too tempting
---
The fuck flew up your nose.
---
Always check the containers around vendors at railroads as well. I constantly dump things in containers by the vendor. 
---
Lol, really??? Never would've thought that. 
---
Please inform me when the game that never gets boring releases.
---
o h y e s ohyes, i have had comin up on 200 hours now of the best gaming in many many years, totally unexpected, fresh AF, i didnt even hear about 76 till BETA promos were up on social media stuff that came up in my work environment.
---
Now that IS fancy 
---
i have a stealth combat knife build and with multiple weightless, chameleon, 3 sneak and escape artist I can be standing in front of most enemies and not be detected. 
---
ghouls and robots usually have a better chance of detecting me
---
As an added bonus I can stealth my way out of a fight with a scorchedbeast, so I don't have to waste my time/durability
---
This is the silliest thing I've ever read combined with a Free States faction tag.
---
So dupers made TSE more accessible to the masses, but not everyone, willing to jump on a forum or discord and ask for one. One exploit lead to a profit of materials. Someone else found out you can gain that profit by hunting down the exploiters and still wear a good guy badge. And now we have someone crying out about hypocritical profiteering.
---
Full circle we have a nice Free States Randian free market. Might be worth reconsidering factions. ;)
---
Hello again Brain seems we still have no word about the other mod yet. But yeah this one is just so great i cant play without it anymorr.
---
It's fickle as fuck, and thanks to that shenanigans, I think I've lost my 3* leg for good when it rolled back my inventory and status (lost some junk and regained disease).
---
There's a workshop in the northern parts of the cranberry bog (Abandoned bog town). The workshop is near the Pylon-V13 fast travel point. 
---
The biggest building close to the actual workshop has 3 floors. The top floor can only be entered trough the roof (the broken elevator shaft). There are a LOT of desks and filing cabinets inside. Almost every desk has a typewriter, a telephone and a desk fan on it. There are also lots of pens, pencils and other good materials there. The second floor has lot of paint cans for lead.
---
All in all it's a great place for springs, screws, fiberglass, lead, steel, etc all in one exterior building.
---
If you want to push it, you can also sweep the mini-police station near the building. There are at least 6 springs in it and there's a nice little excecution shack behind it.
---
I suspect there's a plan for all of them. Combat armor's just easier to find. I have Dense Combat, Robot, Leather and Raider so far. Dense Raider I found today at Harpers, I think. Dense Leather was probably a Grafton vendor.
---
This stupid dollar per hour example. It needs to die and its pointless cause legit reviews are not legit cause someone has 100s of hours ina game?
---
The person would still have a legendary same level but different abilities.  Nerfing a few people to fix a huge problem is beneficial in the big picture. 
---
Well I hope they do not implement 4-5 stars until duping has been completely resolved.
---
The number that actually got TSE legit are very very rare.  I have been playing over 230 hours and never had a single one drop.  I probably have seen 400+ legendaries drop as well.   I recently changed my character to go 15 luck to see if that matters and still not seeing any.   But I am seeing different types of legendaries it seems.   Getting "Medic" legends now where before never got those.
---
That’s true. It’s really hard when another player runs into your battle...
---
Thanks buddy 2 years here and i still love it lol.
---
A fine reward for a job well done Lycan. :)
---
I've been dumping things near the weapon bench in the whitesprings firebreather firetruck station where that robot is chilling by the truck. Stuff that doesn't go with my stealth build I leave on a little bag up fro grabs.
---
not really, it's just literally the gameplay from fallout 4 dumped into an MMO, it's not even remotely close to the most immersive game i've played, it's like picking some super average movie and then saying it has the best plot of all time, people are generally doing to wonder how many movies you've even watched.
---
Killing the queen has a significant chance of crashing the server since the last patch.... does that count?
---
What was glitched about the somerset special from the beta never noticed anything about it
---
For stealth gameplay I had success with shooting from distance and moving to another position. The enemy will come to my last position and I shot them from new position. Repeat until enemy is dead. I would get quickly spotted if I shot twice. Silencer doesn't seem to do much or just makes enemy act weird. I still use it though. 
---
It can definitely be monetized, just look at ark servers, Conan servers, etc. You pay a set fee every month for the privilege. 
---
It's more money for more active user slots, for more memory. Can even be more money for a server in a specific location.
---
Bethesda said they cant remove items from inventories to combat dupers? Now they can suddeny remove em when one shot weapons and invicibility armor is in the wild?
---
I can't find it either
---
It didn't have a legendary effect, i've seen some people had the same thing
---
See I've had that in the past for sure but server hopped just to see what plans so up and have seen nothing for the next 3-4 hops before I gave up and moved on.
---
I guess we'll have to see. It's only anecdotal so could very well be wrong.
---
I just completed it and no caps were given to me. It did disappear from my quest log, but after logging back in it reappeared.
---
BUMP.
---
Anyone know?
---
you know ive been alittle underwhelmed with it, i set out to be a stealth player using the healing factor ability and just evade combat strategically and with marsupial jumping to force enemies into pursuit/retreat paths but its not working out very well. so im switching to try artisan chainsaw nerd rage as an alternative for a while
---
Chameleon armor + evasive perk + marsupial mutation is pretty nice.  With a good suppressed rifle, you can just hop &amp; pop all day.
---
But bots kinda suck and I keep running low on ammo.  The WV lumberyard in the NW corner of the map is a great place to turn 38s into 308s. 
---
'Some Events'.  Some ARE random.
---
I was starting to run  out of stuff to do until I got this mod installed. Have grouped with so many more random people and met some great people.
---
Lol, I am a plan maniac so I am eagerly waiting to see if they respond about the known plan mod :D
---
Why are you assuming the people doing the hunting are using TSE's? I'd imagine people who have benefitted are keeping quiet while the hit dogs are hollering every time duping is brought up negatively.
---
Oh could have swore nothing changed about it think the one I got after beta didn't have an effect either.
---
Its an attempt to keep the people who found them legit with a weapon... even though its not nearly as useful and it removes TSE from the servers completely.    No one can 1 shot SB and make others trivial as much with the TSE removed.
---
The economy is screwed already, you would need to remove all items to fix that.   The duping of serums, flux ammo, bobbleheads, magazines pretty much screwed that up.
---
3 in sneak seems to make a lot of difference, i was never able ot use the chameleon armor effect to great advantage alone / 1 in sneak
---
"The hate for the game is strong and PROFITABLE." Honestly up until this video I've agreed with what most of these YouTuber's have been saying. Fallout 76 had a really rough launch and probably should not have come out until late 2019 or even 2020. Problem is that these said YouTuber's don't give a shit about the Fallout series. They're getting 150k views each video. It's just unfortunate that the criticism of the true Fallout fans are drowned out by these CNN/Fox style YouTube channels that profit on negativity. 
---
Also there are movement speed perks in CHR and AGI. CHR +20% speed in a party. AGI +20% Speed while equipped with a pistol
---
Great news, maybe the latest patch added them to the pool?
---
Ah, good to know it's just a glitch.
---
I think, I'll play for an hour, just finish the quest. Then it's 3 hours later.
---
Same man i want it bad. Yeah met tonnes of people on the chat mod its like our own little community. Everyone is so willing to help one another its really nice to see.
---
If I need steel I skip the cans and just hunt for weapons, Scrapper perk helps with that. Scorched, Super Mutants, Mole Men, all have weapons you can loot and break down for lots of steel. For Lead just go to Lucky Hole Mine with Excavator armor.
---
Are you on PC? If yes then most likely it's because of the "new" duping method that crashes the server has been leaked to too many people.. Which is good, it will bring the attention to Bethesda and hopefully they will fix it ASAP :)
---
I find this from time to time. Thank you very much!
---
Bethesda needs to stop relying on modders to fix their games for them, though. Especially as long as console players can't use them. 
---
recently i was fighting there on my tech/explosives RP char and a guy told me to go take the extras he had dumped in the ice machine, i think things like this are the best we are gonna be able to do for hub like protocols until more permanent base and container building makes it into the game (See my profile for my post on this)
---
We've all got problems, this guy isn't hurting anyone by voicing his opinion. You should not use "being depressed" and "having suicidal thoughts" as a reason to not be criticized for anything you say. That's just preposterous. 
---
I'll put it simply -- I've dealt with and still do deal with both of those problems and more, and your "reasoning" is extremely flawed. You do not speak for anyone but yourself, so please, do not pretend or assume otherwise.
---
Mental illness has nothing to do with this conversation, whatsoever, and the fact that you bring it up as if it is at all relevant is honestly kind of detestable.
---
And they aren't making fun of or harassing anyone, they're' saying that if someone cheated, then they'd be happy if Bethesda banned them, which is not at all unreasonable when you're a legit player. It isn't "wrong" to ban a cheater from playing a game just because it's Christmas or some other holiday. 
---
They knew the consequences of their actions and still performed those actions. It's nobody's fault but their own.
---
That being said, regardless of whether the OP is guilty of cheating or not, I think the point u/DitaVonMeow was trying to make is that they're glad Bethesda is enforcing their anti-cheat policy. Their comment does not seem to be targeting anyone in particular, except maybe the OP. You do not seem to know what cyber-bullying is, and you cannot claim to know the feelings of others as a result of their post.
---
To be 100% clear: this post is not harassment or cyber-bullying, either. You should not take what anyone says on the internet personally, unless you know them personally. Again, no offense intended by this post.
---
Like I said at the beginning of this post, the idea of using mental illness to avoid criticism is just detestable, especially when mental illness is completely unrelated to the topic at hand. 
---
If you happen to be trolling, well, you got me real good.
---
Take care.
---
Hmmm maybe I need bird bones too then? Am running speed, marsup, twisted, talons, chameleon right now.
---
As other have said. Take your time. See a event? Go for it. Workshops are great to take over for new plans for [C.A.M.Ps](https://C.A.M.Ps). You can pick a SPECIAL to level up in but you can pick a different perk card for another stat by cycling through the SPECIALS. ( I did not know that for a while lol) If you come across a Junk Pile that is a PERFECT spot to camp for a while. It can give a ton of rare junk
---
Watching your weight will fill gross and nasty at first, but STR is a lovely stat that can reduce junk weight. Missiles weigh 2 lbs, Mini Nukes weigh 6 lbs, Plasma cores/Fusion Cores weigh 2 Lbs a piece. So careful with how many you carry.  PA IMHO is not worth getting till lvl 30 and above so I wouldn't really worry about getting a chasis till around then. I hope you have fun and are able to get on a stable server.
---
Hmm never heard of that, but I usually just kill them because dont like to keep getting shot from all over then refocus on the SB.
---
Well each item has a unique id so all the stolen items are easy to find plus well this is really only effecting the pc players my guess is they can do more for pc players then console players
---
I'd love to be a fly on the wall at Beth HQ.  
---
I too enjoyed the core recharge bug but now when I need cores I just got to one of the power stations and power it up. Then I claim the nearby workshop and let the core extractor work. Few hours later and I have plenty of cores.
---
You clearly can though go look on YouTube
---
Have a list?
---
same, its bugged somehow, doesnt trigger reward, comes back when you log back in again
---
I do this all the time. I pick up every extra legendary that I don’t care for and leave it there because someone else might love it. 
---
The only reason I did it was because I saw someone else do it so I just had to pay it forward. 
---
Ive been runnin with a silenced shotgun. Max rank enforcer.
---
Full sneak dmg multiplier i can take down most tough enemies in an average of 1-3 shots. Anything tankier will be left substantially crippled. 
---
All while being an invisible ghost. Full shadowed / muffled armor. Chameleon and sneak boosting legendaries.
---
Sooo good. Been supplementing it with a rather nasty anti armor melee weapon for ammo conserving.
---
Sniper for anything far away. 1: To do damage. But 2: To get them to try and find me. Soon as they wander too close - BAM
---
Likely it being a new patch, new patches not tested thoroughly typically introduce new problems. Op is playing Jump to Conclusions
---
say hello to my new best FRIEND, nuka grape are now the only way to recover from RAD before starching genes, except higher level team mates using rad sponge or healing hands
---
The slower fall lets you survive longer drops, and gives you more airtime/distance with marsupial jumps
---
When building at your CAMP it uses resources from your stash first. If you run out if something in your stash, like steel, it will start scrapping your mods in your stash for steel, even before using the steel scrap on your character. Repairing objects in the world, like surface to air missile batteries, also uses steel from your stash first and will scrap mods in stash before using steel you carry with. Lesson learned, keep plenty of steel scrap in your stash to prevent this.
---
Bethesda, if you are listening, please pull materials from a characters inventory first, and only if it cannot be satisfied from inventory, use stash materials.
---
The current order is:
---
# Raw crafting components from stash
---
# Junk / Mods from stash (auto scrapped)
---
# Bulk items from stash (auto scrapped)
---
# Raw crafting components from inventory
---
# Junk / Mods from inventory (auto scrapped)
---
# Bulk items from inventory (auto scrapped)
---
The order should be:
---
# Raw crafting components in inventory
---
# Junk items from inventory
---
# Bulk items from inventory
---
# Raw crafting components in your stash
---
# Junk items from your stash
---
# Bulk items in your stash
---
The reason for this is twofold:
---
(1) Some of us like to keep a constant level of reserve raw crafting components in our stash. Using stash first means we have to constantly micromanage our stash conponents and resupply it from inventory. Inventory should be used first.
---
(2) Mods should never be auto-scrapped for materials from inventory or stash.
---
Even better realism, just disallow auti using stashed materials if a character is not in CAMP or a workshop. Justification: how could you possibly use stashed materials for an in-field repair if a stashbox is not nearby.
---
By swapping weapons like that, you would not be able to specialize your perks.   Also, you would be overloaded with ammo of different types (explosive, energy, ballistic).
---
Wish I could get that lucky! I'm still wapping stuff with a sword. Still.
---
What is this skyrim ? How they one shouting people?
---
I would love a 'Craft X number' option.
---
Private servers fit in with mods, and they've monetized mods in the apast. 
---
its part of the sign and letters plan the one thats 10k caps
---
I learned that workshops give exp and several enemy fighting event missions , so they are fun to do and feel worth it as opposed to having to go find a regular event or do somethign that is a fixed quest in the world. im showing all my friends when they finally have time and can log on
---
I have found plenty of legendary, but no TSE.   A player made handmade has been better for me than any legendary weapons I found.
---
This game is getting worse and worse huh
---
seen it at watoga vendors alot
---
She was a duper, nothing to worry about...
---
I lied and said u didn't get it and went to a new server and dropped all of it and just left the game
---
Oh yes i do, check my latest post and imgur album, basically a complete non atomic shop apparel list.
---
You can also look at gamepedia's page.
---
I do not like this.  The airdrop was perfectly fine as it was with a can of beans, some water and maybe a handful of ammo.  Even if you spammed drops jumping around the map like Santa Claus, it wouldn't be anywhere near game breaking.  Noobs were able to worry slightly less about having stable food and clean water.  It certainly helped me.
---
Between getting a bounty using crafting stations at owned workshops and this, I feel like Bethesda is needlessly creating conflict where none would normally occur.  Losing 5-10 caps and all your junk as a noob is kind of a big deal.
---
I also noticed today that the overseer's boxes have a weight limit now.  Maybe they did before, but I was able to dump a whole lot of food, water,stimpaks, rad chems, modded lowbie legendaries and scrap into them before the last patch.  I thought it would be nice actually walk from 76 to Flatwoods, gathering junk and a good lvl 5 melee weapon, pistol and rifle to mod out for someone to find and eventually grow out of.  I tossed a hardened, suppressed 10mm and a stabilized hunting rifle with a long scope in the overseer's camp stash and got a message that the container couldn't hold anymore.  The weight seems to be capped at 25 or so.  That seems like a strange choice.
---
I thought Ww2 didn’t happen in the fallout timeline, in that case where did it come from?
---
Perhaps the players could have a vending machine in their home.  And then it is connected to a Vending machine in train stations.  That way I can put items in it and collect the caps from it at my camp.  But when  person is at the train station they can see all player vend items at the player vending machine.  That wouldn't expose camps to the map. 
---
 Id set a vending machine outside on the visitor patio area.  That could just show my wares.  Then have that connected to the Railroad Station Vendor Vending Machine.
---
We need to educate the people of the Wasteland so we can rebuild.  I love helping people make better camps by passing on plans.
---
I found that out with the ore event...
---
Thank You For The Info!
---
Is it possible to get it as a drop? Or do you have to buy it? 
---
If there is 1 at the first time, it will respawn right there. In watoga i had a lvl 14 robot, respawned as a lvl 28 the second and as a lvl 50 the third time.
---
It´s not about garanteed spawns, it´s about if has spawned 1, he will always respawn.
---
No, it was taking advantage of the latency when grabbing items between both players on the server, did not involve creating more lag at all.
---
Thank you!
---
I think if it's drops, it must be ultra rare
---
[bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) support, there is an option for reporting users for exploits/cheating
---
Absolutely Awesome!
---
should =/= could. I know you can, I just say it's an issue.
---
Rebooting the server is NOT something your average player should be able to do at will. It should be a very tight scenario happening only if a big issue happens.
---
Now I'm no expert, but if bethesda can't provide servers able to support the huge amount of 24 players, maybe they can ask for advice to a few other companies running MMO. 
---
I understand the map and rules of Fallout 76 are more complex than those of Counter strike, but I'm pretty sure WoW is at least as dense and has a tiny bit more players on servers that aren't crashing every twenty minutes.
---
But I might be wrong.
---
Wait, trader is the seller or the buyer? 
---
That bug allegedly existed since Fallout 4, so... yeah... more than two months!
---
Sweet! found my first explosive weapon after 142 lvls. 30% to robots and something that makes it easier to get crits. 
---
Not the best but i really really hate Mr.Gutsy so i love it!
---
[Fallout 4 cinematic cutscene mentions that the US ended WWII](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jzlqP1JfP1U)
---
Forest finds ---
---
theres a treehouse like thing with a terminal that has an earthquake simulation and several other interesting functions,
---
there is an obstacle course that takes you up to a tower (the tower looks like it has climbing wall attached to its main ascent but its unusable, you have to take the obstacle course) and inside it are supplies, medicine box, and a letter from the creator of it (rare chance to spawn something better maybe a bobble?)
---
Dont they ban people for stuff like this.... I mean... its amazing and shouldve been part of the core game, but.. didnt bethesda say they fkn hate modders now?
---
yea you can get it from claiming workshops but super rare
---
Except for the part where the server crashes entirely, and then you're out of luck. Had that happen once during a power station event, that sucked 
---
On PC its happening to me far more frequently and clearing the cache no longer prevents it.
---
I'd prefer the PKers on PC to the people running around with blindfolds in a collapsing building, praising the (visibly weak) architecture which is the fault of its collapse.
---
yes i noticed that but it doesn't bother much as long as they dead. 
---
Interesting I'm going to have to look into that. Thanks for the info!
---
I wouldn't do it unless I was in a group, and then I'm still not into the resource cost of doing them.
---
I was thinking the same thing.  Then I started trying to spawn the Responder Vendor Bot by fast traveling to Charleston Train Station and running along the tracks towards the Charleston RailRoad Vendor (two separate but close places).  First time I did this the mothman spawned in front of the shack.  [https://imgur.com/utkth0e](https://imgur.com/utkth0e)
---
I have my dedicated times, sure as hell not going to slap my wife from playing fort nite 😂
---
That sucks, especially for that 3\* :/
---
hw much damage is your two shot crossbow? i found one recently, it claimed to be level 15, and its damage number was 190. seemed like a sort of absurdly high damage number
---
Yeah fk bingo lol
---
Just spent 8k caps jumping trough vendors looking for plans. Bought every plan I found that cost less than 600 (and I didn't already have). Good nights work. Way more efficient than my spreadsheet.
---
I'm still getting duped items in my 'stored' section of my camp for seemingly no reason. After the patch I noticed all my characters had loads of extra purifiers and other camp items in stored
---
You are now required by law to make this your profile picture.
---
They can people can user their resources and build on my camp site nothing was falsely advertised check again troll.
---
&gt; It's not the engine's fault. It was originally an engine made specifically for MMOs. 
---
No it wasn't
---
and for the first time, rubberbanding.
---
Fusion cores weight 3 and Plasma cores weight 1, btw.
---
Same im level 140 and never come across any Cav/Unyielding armor or TSE weapons
---
Best roll ive gotten so far was a 2* Furious .50 cal. and maybe the 1* instigating Dragon.
---
I dont know how people are getting god tier weapons every whitesprings run.
---
Im lucky if i pick up any 2* armor during a whitesprings run
---
I’ll buy the sniper. GT is okaypirate
---
You sell on other sites?
---
Yea I'm on PC, as for duping... Hopefully Bethesda pinpoints everyone who's remotely done it (even so much as a bobby pin) and straight up perma-bans them.
---
Used to hunt down dupers. And you know how i do it? Whenever i see server not responding message on the bottom right screen, I open up the map and 80% of the time there's a duo or trio gathered up on some weird places you normally don't go to. You approach them and find out they are duping. Don't know how duping works, but this is how duper hunt works. Server doesn't respond=dupers. This method doesn't work nowadays it seems tho. Server just crashes, giving me no time to respond.
---
The one variant of Mr. Gutsy with the assault rifle or whatever is my least favorite thing to run into in the game, don't know what it is about that gun but it shreds.
---
Thank you.
---
I will be tracking this player and will update if I discover when/if corrective action is taken.
---
Yeah, Youtube channels can be hit or miss whether or not they were directly extracted from the game files or are just rehosting the top search result, but that sounds like the correct version. 
---
There seems to be some debate over whether those two songs still play or were patched out recently.
---
Of course, Fallout 76, instead of using the older, original, uses a version of "Riders in the Sky" that comes from the 1960 Capitol Records album Cool Water which also has a version of "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" which Fallout 76 does not use.
---
("Heartaches by the Number", "Anything Goes", "Accentuate the Positive", "Why Don't You Do Right" and a couple of others are some of my red flags to tell if a playlist is accurate to the weird, obscure versions that Fallout uses)
---
I'm also trying to quash or confirm the rumor that "Great Long Pistol", "Jumpin' Jive", and "That's the Good Old Sunny South" actually appeared in Fallout 76.
---
There's also the new APM Music tracks which play in the Atomic Shop. I'm also trying to confirm the other APM instrumentals and whether they actually play in the jukeboxes.
---
I do not know why Bethesda won’t do the radio playlist thing like Rockstar does. Would make this easier.
---
Plus apparently Spotify used to have the Atomic Platters collection of obscure atomic age music, but it’s all gone now. Ugh!
---
I always find “Fallout” albums on there too with 90% of the songs gone.
---
outwit, outlast, outplay.
---
Yep to the shelving. 
---
The frequency of disconnects and server problems has increased for me on Xbox and I now feel as though I've given the game a fair shake and have fewer qualms about leaving. It's good to hear devs are working on it, but my confidence in them ultimately delivering an enjoyable product has waned. 
---
That's not the first net immerse game, that had mmo shit addded to the engine that was never carried over to bethesda games.  Prince of persia 3d was 2 years earlier than this  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_3D
---
Hes responding to another comment reddit does this
---
What was the helmet? I'm only asking because I have heard from a few people about a certain mask they think is not legit.
---
I had an experience where I shot a scorched up close and their head flew at me, it had no skin, just a solid red fleshy meaty, googly eyed,  lipless noggin coming at me.
---
Yeah ... and you just proved my point as the pvp loss amounts are peanuts compared to serum plans.
---
Always seen supermutants there but don't make it a point to go very often.
---
The worst part about this is that these people grief other players in groups where they feel most safe. I had a trio attack me at random yesterday while I was solo messing around trying to fix a few things up with my gear, then go after my base. They built up a hefty bounty, but no one wanted to pursue them because they were in a high level pack. They had no reason to attack - they did it because they could and knew they could get away with it, unfortunately.
---
PC is beta testing the patch, hopefully they will tweak it before they release for console.
---
It’s the X01 Enclave one with the (I think it’s called). American Patriot paint (atom store) on all the body parts except the head that has the tricentennial paint (tricentennial Edition DLC)
---
Why even craft Adhesive? I got like 5+ bulk stacks just wasting away in my STASH
---
2 of each flux to build.
---
Correct.
---
It was a retro joke about the Creation Club, thank you.
---
You mean the bunker or something else??
---
Servers are ok bro. Never got disconnected during beta. Shit started rolling with the actual release of the game and only got worse after duping went out of control
---
Honestly, bringing it to their attention to ask just makes you a dipshit.  Just raises the odds of them not being ok with it and banning a bunch of people using a mod that harms no one and is a clear thing that should have been in the game to start with
---
Yeah, I've sent a ticket but it's so pointless knowing their reply is basically ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ .
---
Hence, I've uninstalled the game and launcher. Just gonna take a long assed breather until the game unfucks itself.
---
Only when you move your camp. But you pay caps to move it.  Unless you server hop into already occupied location
---
I'm assuming it'll be on-sale release day.
---
Wait wtf who thought it was a good idea to use your camp budget to tame animals? 
---
Whenever I'm trying to place items at my camp the game just says "Item is floating" I server hopped and restarted the game 3 times today and still had this issue. 
---
Thankfully most of the songs are actually present on spotify with only about 8 or 9 that arnt available.
---
Edited it. Thank you!
---
More like 2 years lul
---
Sorry your correct, reverse all the terms ).  
---
“No no no, you know what’s REALLY hurting the game, all the free rides these fuckers are getting from those insanely lucrative supply drops.” -someone at Bethesda I guess. 
---
Most stessing shit is when you have to go on some party with ppl you dont really like and waste half of weekend, man thats so much hours. Am I nerd?
---
I might have a fuzzy memory, but specifically the escaped subject was a Snallygaster... Wasn't it?
---
Looks really nice
---
Cheers, my character is near Harper's ferry at the moment so i will look out for them, can't fast travel though ( I live a over encumbered lifestyle lol) 
---
When i spawn in a world my pip boy is invisible, i cant move and the menu just crashes the game.
---
Hm... you do have more numbers.
---
I'm 93, play solo only, have 200+ hours and still don't know how to use criticals - can you recommend me some "guide for dummies"?
---
Sure it would. 45% reduced damage(Blocker)  times 40% reduced damage (full Assassins) times 20% reduced damage (Lone Wandered) times 30% (Dodgy) ends up at 1.08% damage taken. 4K becomes... 43
---
Nice! Thanks!
---
I fought muties too.
---
Yeah, they are doing free patches, but if you have to complain, just delete it, you cant enjoy this type of game anyway, delete your internet and go for walk or something. 
---
dont know i didnt check the id of the escaped one with the experiment id lol
---
I feel like the top 10 would go something like this, in any order.
---
1: All Duplication Glitches being removed 
---
2: Fixing constant Blue Screening/Disconnecting from Server
---
3: Adding an indicator for plans which are already known.
---
4: Fixing loot bags from falling through the earth
---
5: Tweaking 2SE weapons to be not nearly as effective as they are right now against players
---
6: Making places other than Whitespring/Prime Fissure worth nuking
---
7: Raising the 200 cap Vendor buying limit
---
8: Stopping Scorchbeasts from spamming the fuck out of their sonic blast attacks
---
9: Stopping Auto-scrapping mods when crafting
---
10: Making taking workshops more worth it, and giving more resources
---
Sweet. Now I'm eager to find out how fast I can swing an axe with martial artist. 
---
@bethesda Is the hunters hood a dev room item?
---
&gt;After waving at them and getting one to wave back, she returned to building up the interior of her base only for one of these dickheads to open up on her base with an explosive minigun and levels the place.
---
You basically just described the opening scene for Fallout 2😂😂😂😂
---
Are you okay? Do you need a hug or something o.0?
---
A few of them are. Hanayama? Yeah. Definitely. Nothing puts him down.
---
Dang, Fallout 76 has really improved over these few months.
---
&gt; Edit: STOP DOWNVOTING because you read the word DUPE! Bethesda needs to see this!
---
maybe submit an actual bug report instead of making a reddit post?
---
I also found some coordinates at West Tek detailing the last known location of an escaped subject from before the war. I checked them out on google earth and it pointed to a location near Huntersville a ways to the northeast, I think. Went a ways northeast of Huntersville ingame and found a small lake with a Super Mutant Behemoth in it. Figure that must be the escaped subject.
---
Can't remember if they were the same coordinates or not but it was very cool to actually follow the coordinates to find something.
---
Vendor Phoenix in Watoga shopping center sells it. I’ve seen it three times. It’s 11,500 caps but if you have a three star barter perk card, plus take a grape mentat, the cost goes down to 930 caps. 
---
Now I feel like a major idiot for tossing aside a 2-shot vats accuracy radium rifle.  I always thought these were nearly useless because of the rad effect.
---
You don’t need to read reddit all day it takes less then 2 mins to type in fallout nuke codes this week on google search and then you’re sorted
---
Yeah, on the 11th they released a update which fixed A LOT. there is still more to fix, as far as I know, but they've covered a lot of what the community was asking which is a good thing. Although this update is only out for PC so far, PS4 is coming out in a few days
---
You get a real enemy, and to interact with the whole other side of online multiplayer that was designed for PvP. It's a part of the game people want to play. 
---
It's been a while since I read the WestTek stuff but I was pretty sure the escaped subject's ID was also mentioned on another terminal as "having ocular organs along its body" or something along those lines. I could be mistaken.
---
Ah okay I'm on PS4, I'll wait a few days and check it out. 
---
I reported the player and I will wait for Bethesda to take action.  I have a ticket number, and have specifically detailed the accusations in a post to their support.  
---
I will report whether my complaint is answered in a manner that indicates this player was cheating.
---
YongYea put out another shitty low effort Fallout 76/EA/Activison hit piece? Color me shocked.
---
Why you think so? I am ok. Told you, they are working on patches. Also i did told you, that you can delete it, if you dont play. but eh, if you have some psycho, i would like to take it, maybe without killing you, or so?
---
It's okay, go take a walk you'll feel better. 
---
Ctrl+Tab , right click on your name, Leave World. Then hit Play.
---
I was having this happen yesterday on PS4 with my PA's left leg. I'm almost always carrying around some armor that I need to sell or deconstruct, so I didn't know why I've only gotten that bug one day.
---
That is exactly what I did. Can I not post to warn others? 
---
As an update, the direct link is:
---
Help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Oh shit no, feel exactly the same 
---
I didn’t have 500 in the first place 
---
I was being hunted today.  I had to get off because my heart was beating too fast for too long and I'm old.  It was heaps of fun, and they didn't kill me or get my junk, yee-ha!
---
That works for a while, but in the end you want a weapon that actually shows you that you're doing damage to the SBQ. You don't need TSE to do that, but you need a legendary weapon.
---
And really, getting a weapon/armor with any legendary effect is better than having base weapons/armor. It keeps you from scrapping your stuff
---
Not certain if they all were, I was on the other side of the map. Luckily it improved later and was able to play normally.
---
They are luring players for pvp, lvl 300 go for bounty, he kills him, but gets only 5caps, becouse he dont have more. Those guys from bountied player party kills this bountyhunter and gets 300caps. 
---
Its weird, i end up having 271 or 268 carry weight.
---
"She was devastated"
---
Did you forget to tell her you can rebuild the entire base how it was with the press of two buttons?
---
I don’t think they were doing that, they were just going out destroying camps on purpose, and then defending the wanted player. They didn’t seem to want to pvp. 
---
About 250 I believe lvl 45
---
Where'd you get the plans for X-01 mods? I haven't heard of anyone finding them before.
---
Try using Dodgey too 
---
Honestly, my suggestion for you is to wait a bit. If you can try out one of the other FO titles. Let the updates keep coming in so that way when you do come back it can be a true enjoyable exprience.
---
Lol, all good.. and that was your adrenaline pumping, no one has a heart attack from adrenaline lol 
---
I finally got him to spawn this week and he died while i was looking at his wares.  LOL!  [https://imgur.com/sru1eeU](https://imgur.com/sru1eeU) 
---
The server was crashing more immediately after patch, before there were any known dupe methods. Before the very first dupe method was dropped, the servers were unstable. The dupers certainly aren't helping, but there's def something inherent with the game that's unstable
---
Its true use is for sneaking up on a camp and randomly opening and closing the shutters while someone's inside. Pretty funny watching the response.
---
Will do, I'll see how the ps4 patch is in the next couple of days. Is leveling still god awful? That was one of my biggest concerns. 
---
It conflicts with the actual best mod, icon sorting tags; so id rather have that.
---
Okay, second best mod. The best mod is perk loadout manager. 
---
And third best is definitely text chat, it will change your life.
---
"speaking chinese" ah good too know
---
I saw one drop instantly from about 60% to zero health for the first time today. I couldn't tell who did it though.
---
This is fairly close to what I use including all the power armor suggestions except..... I'm still in the process of moving points over from perception and I'm itching to use Big Guns (but the build you posted works fine with a Gatling.....).
---
Suggestions: Ditch Class Freak. Buy the serums and use them instead. This would also allow you to ditch Life Giver since you wouldn't be taking the Adrenal Reaction penalty at all. Maybe those points can go to Fireproof for explosive resist (scorch beast screams) in PA?
---
Strange in Numbers annoys me endlessly and I've stopped using it. Here's hoping it's somewhat fixed in the latest patch?
---
I don't pay shit for my Conan Server, unless that changed since I stopped playing 4 or so months back.
---
Regardless, I'd be happy to pay for a private Fallout 76 server for me and my friends to play alone or for me to explore alone. It's one of the few things I didn't like about Fallout 76. 
---
What kind of improvements were you looking for? Why’d you leave?
---
&gt; I'm not moving, the explosive is pushing me back
---
Counts as moving and disables Sentinel's protection. Same with being hit by melee.
---
Fuckin great! I’m comin up on 200 hrs several characters as an rp / character Building / adventure type
---
Player I’m just so pleased the game reached us this pure with flexible classing and interesting equipment and perk and mutation combos. 
---
I can't really comment on the leveling as tbh I don't even really worry about it. It's slow if your not pumping out quests/events or farming a nuke zone. So if your goal is to level fast I would assume so.
---
lol 930? 9300? i assume u mean 
---
A critique is bad becuase the person, "Didn't play enough." A critique is bad becuase, "If it was such a bad game why did you play so long?" I give up trying to add some objectivity to these discussions. Thanks for the downvotes all!
---
As long as there is breath in my body, the order of mysteries shall endure!
---
Shoot, yesss! It’s 9300. My bad 😆 
---
So I got this quest that says "Kill a windigo while wearing a clown outfit."   Well after checking the easy places one might be, I sigh and head to the Windigo Cave.
---
After 20 minutes of crawling through and about 2 minutes until I get to it, I start getting the "Server is not respoinding, controls have been disabled" (SINRCHBD) message.   Every 10 seconds.  Freaken duper.  I try and struggle through the stupid mess for 5 minutes and just get to frustrated with pumping enough ammo into a mob to kill 3 of them and watching them stand there mocking me.
---
I give up and change servers and spend another 15 minutes crawling and then... SINRCHBD again.    Every 10 seconds.  CRAP!  After 2 minutes of this... I change servers.
---
This time I make it to about 27 minutes and just about 30 seconds left and the Windigo would be splatted.   SINRCHBD.   After the next attempt, I was able to get it.
---
Killing this dang thing took over 1.5 hours because the freaken dupers.   Good news is after the most recent patch, I have not seen the SINRCHBD rear its head at all.
---
So much this. I played yesterday and the day before. I had it crash a total of 10 - 12 times on me. Very frustrating, I've finally accepted it as part of the game for now. But when it first happened. I was very frustrated. 
---
- Vampyreguardian 
---
Weight and stash became a huge problem. It felt like I was playing an inventory management game half the time. Building your Camp was super tedious because of placement issues, and twice I logged in to find my camp destroyed because someone else built there. The leveling felt...like a grind just for the sake of grind? Some of the perks felt useless or bugged. I think those were my biggest issues personally. I know there were more around launch. 
---
You know those serums are temporary when it comes to suppressing the negative effects...
---
I saw exactly who did it..... not to mention the "Under attack by _____" notification that I barely survived. :\
---
Yes. They cheaply crafted, though, and if you don't have the recipe..... They're cheap.
---
thank fuck because they may not have killed me in game, but I thought I was going to cark it in real life for a second.  Exhilarating.
---
I was level 45, so I was close to endgame I think. I had a lot of missle codes I'm sure. 
---
I guess if you want to go through that every time lol 
---
I simply break down and rebuild every time
---
It's easier than well-turned or well rested and only slightly more tricky than well fed. ;)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glbuUA-CgqI&amp;feature=em-comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glbuUA-CgqI&amp;feature=em-comments) video of where they are talking about.
---
i went there on 4 separate servers yesterday and there was only a recipe plan for tea.  Perhaps picked over already.  I just need the dang Chest Combat piece!  :)  
---
Whatever makes you feel better lol 
---
Honestly the only thing that’s changed  from what you mentioned is stash was increased by 200 pounds. Everything else is pretty much the same
---
Get the carry weight cards like thru hiker, play how you wanna play, practice combat at whitespring clubhouse. Join a community try to find players who may be around your schedule of logging on teaming is awesome and you can co op freely or just use team for trading and perk sharing and fast travel
---
Hows the endgame? Are there like groups raids or bosses and the like? Besides scorchbeasts
---
Yikes. Hmmm. Not what I was expecting haha.
---
Not official mods users should be banned right away. It is nice that Bethesda is doing there work great in that aspect 
---
The negatives are only supressed for an hour from serums. All of my mutations are from serums (I can craft all of them) and they have negatives
---
I don't understand what I would have to feel better about? O.o
---
This is a strange thread...
---
Life is not fair, especially in the wasteland. Man up !
---
Okay? 
---
[What, no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvmytj56Tck)
---
Lol I’m not trying to steer you away tho. I personally enjoy the game. I love camp building and stuff. But I will admit it gets tedious when the stuff won’t snap together 
---
Dude I hate to tell you but that’s early midgame 
---
I think That's intentional so you can complete quest challenges. Also rewards me with 20 caps every time. 
---
Or the jerk players.   I was in Whitespring after a nuke zone went away and some jerk tried to finish me off when noticed I was low health and high rads.    Even with a sniping rifle and perks he could do little damage, but I poped 3 radaways, drank some tea and the guy could not do a thing.    Even the mini-nuke he launched did not touch me much.   Since the player was a scumbag, he earned the first "Block" I ever did on a player.   I have "Blocked for session" some people when they just try to PVP me and I dont feel like it.  But this scumbag earned the perma-block.
---
What about those who are scared of anyone and all who you encounter? I think there should be some buffers in place first and foremost protecting all players from being preyed upon
---
I kinda unsubbed because of this video. I thought the video was about the dev room but then he started by summarizing what fo76 did wrong. 
---
Feels like he is just pumping the viewers into an outrage.
---
I would be ok with unscrappable.  
---
I leave extra things either in cash registers next to trader bots, or in a paper bag at Whitespring right as I walk in the door (either at the top, or the bottom of the stairs). Plans weigh 1/4 pounds each! It’s better to share. Can’t sell them, anyway. 
---
I've been using an explosive/mutant slayers combat rifle for long range for probably about a month now.  I did a little test with my base damage perks (maxed rifleman/expert/master, demo expert, covert operative, mister sandman, bloody mess, tank killer, glow sight/adrenaline) at full health, without the benefit of rank 1 nerd rage and adrenal reaction mutation, and it goes north of 500 damage with adrenaline going.  That's upwards of 1750 a shot at night, and 1250 during the day.
---
Me too. I always put the plans in the cash register next to the vendor bots.
---
Thanks guys! I got Speed demon and also the Perks but it's to slow for me :/ so leg. Armour with this effect doesn't exist in 76? Because I saw a few weeks ago 1 player who runs 2 times faster then me even though I have the Perks 😥
---
Nothing has changed about the endgame 
---
Haha. It's been a bit more than a week since i reported something to bethesda and i have yet to come up with any form of response. Good luck with your bug reports bro
---
it's all fun and games until you get banned for using this because Bethesda likes to act like a jackass towards its own community
---
Yep 
---
damn it’s that easy? 😂🤷‍♂️
---
I would like an easy way to see what was in the atomic store while im offline.  i work weird hours that change constantly.  if they put out some crazy pink paint for armor or jetpack smoke that is rainbow colored and I miss it I will be so sad.  SAD I SAY!  lol :)  
---
It is, i'm also sure someone will give you PA, i would have crafted you one but sadly i'm on PC.
---
11. 
---
Is the endgame still just launching a nuke/scorchbeasts?
---
Well, adrenal reaction is easy to craft, but scaly skins... coal.. I only know of 7 coal nodes in this game and that's kind of annoying... the other negatives are negligible.. but the -50 ap is not..and maintaining a supply of scaly skins would be..a pain.. do you know of any other coal spots aside from burning mine/Gauley mine?
---
You might also ask for Ultracite plans. You get them from SB/SBQ and most players have a ton of extras.
---
I'm around 90, picked up lots of gear. Most of the TSE on the servers are duped at this point.  They should be nerfed or destroyed. The drop rate is abysmal and people have several? I could see 3 but more you have to wonder.
---
damn man you must be minted, i barely had the resources to repair it 😂 appreciate that man now worries.
---
Yep, launch nuke, kill queen for like no rewards 
---
lol i figured
---
Probably not. 
---
Yeah, same happened to me during my first launch. I was real proud because I had tackled it solo as a stealth/rifle build and am a bit slower at killing things than most because of this. I launch my nuke, rush out to watch it hit the ground, suit up, annnnd crash. Now I just wait for friends to get on.
---
Yep, during a White Spring nuke event, I went and found 30 or so legendaries in that cooler. I took some for myself (to replace non legendary armour and weapons) and dropped several of my own from the farm I didn't want. Also took and gave ammo.
---
Lmao, damn it.
---
Look for Silo Codes im Internet maybe this will help you
---
This community is easily the worst of any game I have ever played, licking the asshole of a company that abuses them.  Complete, idiotic masochists. 
---
If i'll check i won't get banned for it won't i ?
---
will they come with the full suit or do you have to find the plans for arms legs torso etc. i’ve killed my fair share of scorchbeasts but not seen or heard of anyone getting them.
---
The Tattered Mole Helmet gives a 1 damage resistance.  
---
Lucky break has always worked for me. I have it on level 3 for weeks and it procs.
---
But you need a key card right I had one but I'm pretty sure I dropped it 
---
Feels bad
---
I think I got an early ton of coal from quests in the Ash Heap and have never had to actively look for it, tbh. You might check if it comes from the Ore related quests there (escort the robots, empty the hoppers, power up Mount Blair, etc). I still have some 70 pieces and I have no idea where I got them.
---
Great story
---
Are you on PC? I could help you sometime I have spare cards. i don’t mind giving one to u. although the codes expire tomorrow night for me, and i won’t be on til after that if smthn comes up. 
---
Olivia is a fucking cunt.
---
At least you got to put the code in. I have tried launching a nuke twice and in both times disconnected during the launch prep.
---
I found a bunch of ammo I needed tonight there and dumped all the ammo I don't use in its place. It's a great spot!
---
I've seen a mix of scorched and muties there depending on my level at the time. Thinking about it, there are a fair amount of enemies on the location, which could make it quite good for nuking.
---
I have no idea. I haven't heard of anyone getting banned for using 2+ magazines, but if you're worried about it don't do it. ;)
---
&gt; ThE TeAM iS aWaRE oF tHiS SuGgeStIoN  
---
It's trying to communicate!
---
Quick question, does the Gauss rifle count as a rifle or an energy weapon from a perk point of view ? Thanks !
---
Its my fault I don't want a basic ass camp
---
I have a somewhat "boring" armor piercing/mutants/vats accuracy handmade (someone tossed it on the ground during a whitesprings nuke) as my close range rifle and the armor piercing effect is outstanding against scorchbeasts.  It does like 113 base damage, but seems to take out a scorchbeast quicker than my explosive long range combat rifle with over 250 base damage.  The 85 round drum doesn't hurt, either.  The explosive rifle is way better against ghouls, animals and scorched, but I clearly do more damage with the AK against robots, scorchbeasts and deathclaws.  I also don't have to worry about blowing myself up when they get right in my face.
---
Glowing ones xp is nerfed in the latest patch
---
Plans for arms, legs, torso, etc.
---
They're rare from normal scorchbeasts but they do drop along with prime receivers. Or maybe I'm confused and they only drop prime receivers?
---
Either way, other players will surely have duplicate plans if they've fought the queen.
---
Forgot launch prep. So there still time 
---
Interesting... because if I could ditch class freak I really would love to. But finding a decent supply of coal is holding me back from doing that. I guess I could just put it on for general play and put on something else... does serendipity work in power armor? I've read it does not, and I've also read that it does
---
Okay since push back counts as moving would it be best to mix Cavalier's and  Sentinel's Armor? E.g. 2x Cavalier's and 3x Sentinel's armor pieces? 
---
There’s a marine helmet that gives physical protection, and one of those weird Halloween masks
---
I've been having the same issue on xbox too, that together with the dps damage bug means I'm just avoiding fights for now...
---
sorry what are prime receivers? yeah hopefully someone sees the post who has some spares :) 
---
Haha I guess since did have one 
---
Unfortunately im on the ole sexbox, i appreciate it though!
---
ah darn, haha well worth a shot 😂
---
Yea my game still crashes regularly, but after tonights fiasco im not sure im going to be playing anymore anyway lol
---
I have a similar one minus the 25% less AP. Not even sure if it's worth keeping since getting the mods for it is a  bitch in itself to get.
---
If it's time related (like SBQ battles) maybe an AP food if you want to mitigate the AP penalty without Class Freak? I don't know what food would be best, though.
---
I played with Serendipity in PA and I honestly can't tell. I ran into the confusing responses, too, and I'm not entirely sure. I _think_ it does.
---
Lone Wanderer certainly does, and so does Empath (but you really want to chug serums with Empath and it's very buggy with Class Freak/SIN). Those are both damage reduction solo or in a team.
---
I don't get it. Why must it be one or the other? Just blame both.
---
To those players that dupe/hack, either 
---
1. accept a rollback to a confirmed state where they weren't cheating
---
2. accept a reset acc if state can't be found.
---
3. blocked from global multiplayer servers.
---
That should be pretty fair. After all, you don't just accidentally cheat. I suppose those that got hacked items unknowingly will just send a letter to Bethesda and I'm not sure how things will go from there.
---
As for Bethesda,
---
1. Patch the exploit.
---
2. Catch and deal with hackers/cheaters/dupers.
---
Games are bound to have bugs. You just got to fix the bugs as they come. Lol, don't be like the previous Bethesda games and rely on community mods to do it.
---
Gamers are at fault for cheating, get banned.
---
Bethesda is at fault for the bugs, just fix them, geez. 
---
Hm... actually what if Bethesda were to start giving out compensation for any maintenance or patches? Mobile games do it all the time and it helps to soften the damage from having to wait. Yeah... that should help a bit.
---
If you’re on PC I’ll take any shotgun shells, 5.56 ammo, or 2mm EC ammo you have. I’ll even throw some caps back your way
---
you can also destroy them with grenades if you get them right
---
Yes, I have swapped out many of the normal armors with legendary ones, but not found a good rifle that will match my perks yet.   Usually the handmade still wins over the one I find.  Like found a good gause but thats mainly a sniper weapon and not good up close.  I've use it before and while it packs a huge punch once, the recoil plus limited ammo capacity plus reload makes it not ideal for close range.   Meaning would need to carry 2 rifles around.  Too much weight.
---
TSE Shottys are the best at this
---
Prime receiver plans teach you how to make receivers and ammo for weapons that consume special Ultracite ammo. They do bonus damage to scorched.
---
Not many are really worth the expense of the ammo (it costs flux), though.
---
i will give it a try next silo run i still think grenades are better tho
---
Can people still disturb you if you play solo? I've been thinking about playing FO76 but I don't really like to deal with trolls. 
---
I heard about some safe mode option... that blocks other people completely right?
---
ahhhh okay, thanks! didn’t know that :)
---
Would love to help you out but I’m on PS4
---
So when did they enable text messages in game?
---
&gt;!The strangler vines aren't related to either the Interloper or the Scorched; there's a note or holotape somewhere that mentions they're the result of an idiot who found an old GECK in one of the Vaults and completely fucked up.!&lt;
---
Pretty much.  Most of the information we have comes from in-game experimentation because we don't have a GECK/Creation Kit this time around.  So if I want the stats for each level of combat rifle, for instance, I have to go through and make each level of combat rifle.  Or if I want to see how much armor  piercing the different magazine mods give, then I'll need another player to act as a guinea pig.
---
My hope is already lost.
---
There are lot of community bugfixes for Skyrim/Fallout 4. These mods are available for years, but Bethesda manages to come up with the same bugs in FO76. Skyrim was released more than 8 years ago. So my hope is lost that they just copy and paste the solution (or at least look how the mods work, get an idea to solve their bugs and implement a proper solution).
---
But I'm sure they will offer us some CreationClub Mods for some atoms or a few bucks instead. Needless to say that also the quality of those mods are not worth the price, when there are higher quality mods for free.
---
It's also the only time the ripper can kill something.....
---
If you really want to use a ripper that's pretty much all it can be used for. ;)
---
I'd recommend keeping it around for obvious reasons, I actually suspect the mod learn chance is bugged.
---
Ive had that happen. Its pretty spooky,  especialy when you exit it to use the power armor station and it says "someone else is using this right now" or whatever and its like well shit...
---
I end up just taking the armor off the chasis and then. Getting a new chasis to put it on
---
Yeah I think that has something to do with the Great Winter that takes place in 2130, it’s mentioned in the Fallout Bible
---
The Dr with empath only affects your team mates though right? Bc if that's the case I can just craft a ton of serums for my girl and have her run that for me (luckily I'm a very lucky man who has a gamer chick for a gf). 
---
Well to be fair why would I keep something I have no use for... its not something that’s broken, it’s just an extra step to better a players quality of life. Obviously I wouldn’t have scrapped the helm if I knew I needed it for the next part of the quest lol 
---
Hopefully the game will patch the room out.
---
Lol, maybe leave the room there and continue to ban those players. Let them be traps for hackers :D
---
That was funny, you crack me up haha 🤣 
---
This is the best comment, yet also sad that it's so true :/
---
Not a single time in 70 hours of gameplay.
---
You'll get to that point. Kind of like how everyone gets rid of the hunting rifle. After a while it just won't deal enough DPS. Chances are if you play the game without the deliberate intent to find better equipment by farming legendaries, you won't find anything worth changing out for. Yesterday I found an instigating shotgun with explosive. A gun that powerful you should probably consider re-speccing for. Unless you're an active trader, the best tactic is probably to build your character around the drops, not to build your character and how your drops fit you. They usually won't. 
---
the rage i strong with this noob
---
We messaged through xbox, not in game. You can click on anyone's dot on the map and select Send Message, and it opens up an Xbox message panel. 
---
duping, glitching, and cheating would be even be easier.  so yes please give us a private server so i can hook all my homies up.
---
So basically in the Fallout universe, the US tried a different round instead of scrapping the project entirely.
---
Right, that's exactly what you do: top everyone off with Empath serums before a big fight and make sure no one is carrying the penalty. Off you go with a generous damage reduction for both of you. :)
---
Just don't forget to wipe if you go solo and don't assume Class Freak or Strange in Numbers work correctly.... It can really hurt.
---
My team drops all our unwanted legendaries in Artisans Corner's cash register. Usually after queen fights you can check watoga station's suitcases and register for legendaries. It's also worth inspecting legendaries people sell. Often times they sell them without inspecting the 2nd and 3rd star. Sometimes they just don't know how powerful they are and sell them mistakenly
---
I guess I've been pretty lucky over ~72 hours. People (rarely) come to my base, wave hello, and use the stash, sometimes dropping stuff afterwards.
---
I do sneak when I'm at my base. Otherwise you're visible on the map. And I keep pacifist mode on so I don't accidentally opt-in to PvP.
---
Hello! Please submit a support ticket and include all this info :) https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Uninstalled the game completely(PC), downloaded and reinstalled. I played for 8 hours straight on the same server yesterday, no more crashes for me!
---
I want them to replace the room with a sign that says nice try asshole

Armor piercing is definitely undervalued, My main pistol is an Anti-armor/Explosive Western revolver and i like it much more than the Two shot/explosive one i have. though on weapons with Armor piercing magazine mods i prefer having furious or maybe quad for lower fire rate weapons.
---
Yes, _**except**_ the 50 Cal. There's no other receiver so you're stuck with Prime if you buy it that way.
---
I always have pacifist. I usually give back to other players, never lock anything. Let people take what they want, and they usually appreciate it. 
---
Ok cool. Thanks for the info
---
If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile 😉
---
Single shot rifle that uses energy ammo to deal ballistic damage that is reduced by the grounded mutation. It's a clusterfuck. 
---
Yeah I gave up doing the photo challenges because i have some in there i want to keep.  I do back them up in my xbox screenshots though so i can get to them outside the game
---
Bethesda. You need to get rid of the Wrecking Ball Perk. You can't give the Workshops away as it is. Why would you think it was a good idea to make them even less attractive? 
---
I’m lv 52 predominantly a lone wolf / dingo player, my son is lv 14 I’d love to make him or give home some cool stuff to make his life / game easier but I only have one friend who is hardly ever online so he just has to swallow a big spoonful of cement and harden up Appalachia style. 
---
You can find them both in the world in long range weapon spawns and also get them from quests that reward long range weapons.
---
I still see the lever action for sale in Welch (I think?) and I'm well over level 100.
---
Yes, I have stopped watching most gaming youtubers because of the bashing on FO76.   I enjoy playing the game and most of the FO76 Bashers are just lying anymore.
---
I’d forgotten about this conversation, it was a dypo, surely a superior intellect could have worked that out?
---
Of course it all makes perfect sense now...
---
I can't tell you how many times she has gotten dced and my marsupial stopped working leading to a death..and vice versa... I've recently just taken it off and throw something stupid like travel agent on in its place jus bc I haven't bothered to look for a 1 cost perk to replace it with.. I refuse to drop under 9 charisma though... I really like having tebdorizer or suppressor shared... even though herd puts me well above 9..I've noticed if you don't have the hard cha points to share a perk, it will kindly unshare itself.... :/
---
Sbq drops t60 jetpack, and phoenix will rarely have the rest
---
I was curious as to why I found one of those today with some plans. This explains it.
---
You can do exploration in every game, that doesn't make them exploration game. World of Warcraft, you can explore world. Crysis, you can explore the world. Is Crysis an exploration game? No, it isnt. Crysis is FPS. Every game has exploration, but not every game is exploration game. Just like Crysis, Fallout never was exploration game. Yea you looked around the map, because there might be valuable, but games purpose never was to make player climb tallest mountain for the scenery, instead game made you to climb that mountain because there is quest checkpoint.
---
What other game brings players together like this? Loving Fallout 76
---
I was getting this message and another saying that the item (which was a foundation) had to be on a foundation. I then noticed that I was short one wood for that item. I hadn't noticed. I got the extra wood and it placed fine. 
---
I was able to buy 19 of them from a vendor at a train station now cant remember the location . It was cheap to only like 70 caps
---
Wife, toddler, newborn, 2 jobs - all of them are suffering because all I want to do is play this game. 
---
I tend to use the lunch pail myself
---
Even fallout 4 crashed enough times on me, if parts of that engine got moved to the server the crashes don't suprise me.
---
I.... wow.
---
This is actually an amazing idea! 
---
after long search i found lever rifle plan, homemade is just a myth. 
---
Where 
---
Just leave them in a bag in front of the vendor.
---
Somewhat a same. Wait for a few months, some realy nice changes coming up. You are lucky, you, at least, can play if you want. I cant because my game graphics is broken to a degree of almost unplayable.
---
people downvote you but they are probably those who are exploiting and whatever the fuck. they ruin the game. what do you have to gain aside from proving you put way too much time into a game. get a job or smthn, make some REAL money. 
---
i support what you’re doing here, because fuck that. some people come home from work to a game from a series they love only to see people like them fuckn it up for everyone else. 
---
Nothing more exciting than using some QoL mods that may or may not get you banned. I'll be using this along with the Imperfect 21x9 and Perk Load Manager.

Meh work smarter not harder, keep a notebook A4 size should suffice break it into differing categories and you’ll never have to fret about your stuff again.

So is this why ive been disconnected from a few servers yesterday. I really dont know what to tjink of thos game. I few biased towards it. Fallout is the best game ever made hands down however i feel that Fallout 76 was wasted potential. The thing about 76 is that yes it is still fun but unlike 3 and 4 inwhich i would llay for 15-30 hours straight with no sleep, the maximum I can play this for with before i get bored is 2 hours. I hope this game has alot of good dlc and becomes something much strong interms fallouts typical emmersive storylines and character developments.

Patrol Duty event
---
Why is the assumption that duping is causing crashes at all?  I'm asking not because I disagree, just that it seems to be so accepted and I haven't seen any reason why.
---
Trust me, I know all about Strange in Numbers messing things up.... The DR and damage boost from Adrenal disappearing is often a quick RIP. It also seems to happen if someone sends an invite..... and then sometimes bird bones goes crazy and I can walk on air when I really don't want to. Strange in Numbers is really annoying. I haven't heard if the latest patch fixed it at all.
---
I didn't actually know you could share perks with "soft" points. Can you? If, for example, I had 5 Charisma and Unyielding kicked me to six, are you saying I can share 2 CHA perks?
---
On PS4 i killed 63 people with bounty, mostly they do not react. [Once some guy was "accepting" he is going to die.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsjimlwPrI0&amp;t=30s) Also when i kill low level i drop some super stimpaks i have from farming SBQ, becouse i do not want players get frustrated. And if high level dont attack me first, i never do, becouse 175lvl = 175caps if he kills me with TSE. I AM NOT GIVIN FREE CAPS EVER! But if they do attack first, yeah i have TSE too, or 4\* machete slice thru 250-400hps players in one hit too. 
---
So in my experience, pvp is silent coward game. 
---
&gt; I just think that is unfair
---
Engine has skyrim in its DNA so there are no surprises about wonky code. I think these techniques involve overloading the server with items so it goes wrong. Like if you craft hundreds and hundreds of items it gets to a point where you stop loosing material to make more and then the game packs in.
---
You sir are an evil genius!
---
did you not read the rest are u actually joking
---
This better be a fucking joke, plenty of online games have separate testing areas, especially MMO's.
---
Not so long ago WoW's GM/Dev testing islands were glitchable.
---
It only affects the icon in front of plans, no others. I'm ok with it messing up those few to gain the functionality. 
---
Appreciate you saying that.  I’ll continue reporting them in game and downvoting them here on reddit.
---
War never changes 
---
I mean, it sounds an awfully lot liken*you’re* the asshole here...
---
Looks like you didn't read what i wrote, and it seems (for your sake) that you're 12.
---
That wow exploit doesn't prove anything because in that thread people are saying they can't replicate it.
---
Also that link to imgr could also be him opening multiple BG chest or server hoping.
---
Note they only got conquest points once. That means they got the daily lock out on the war mode chest or the pvp chests if that is what they are opening.
---
I just bought the plans at Grafton, not the vendor at the station. They are marked Lever Gun, so not obviously the right plans, but they are.
---
LMAO that’s what you resorted to? You tell me to man up, well now i’m telling you to grow up. 
---
Sooo the master rifleman perk applies ?
---
Great idea, but dear lord this is suggested at least a dozen times a day. 
---
To quote the guy I said that to
---
&gt;Not official mods users should be banned right away. It is nice that Bethesda is doing there work great in that aspect
---
If you think like that you are straight up an idiot, and anti consumer.
---
Also, you cant be wearing power armor. I had the mining hat on and pickaxe equipped, killed one and checked challenges to find it incremented. Put on power armor, killed a few, didnt increment. Took off power armor and incremented again.
---
Welch railroad stop is a great starting point when attempting, if done right you can kill all ten in this one stop :) 
---
Yep.
---
Honestly one day I decided to grind workshops until I got rewarded them. I got it first try thankfully but that’s how I did it. 
---
&gt;and just play the friggin game.
---
hmmm might just be that they can't play in peace without DC's and as such would rather focus on whacking the moles rather than getting constantly interrupted thus souring the immersion and overall game experience.
---
I've found the lever gun plans at Lewisburg station at level 51 on an alt character. Could have been a fluke, I didnt need it so I didnt buy it. The handmade plans only spawn for from levels 15-40 something apparently. I have made 2 alt characters and both have found plenty of Handmade and lever gun plans at Harpers Ferry around levels 15-20. 
---
I heard a rumor and saw a clip of a guy finding a handmade plan in a container/duffle in a room near the warden at the prison. If you go up th ledr side stairs when entering from the yard then turn left at the tip and head straight back you'll find the container or dufflebag cant remember. But he claimed it spawned there, could have been a troll.
---
After level 30 or so my second alt stopped finding handmade plans in Harpers Ferry.
---
^ This.
---
I got the plan at Level 80 the first time I completed this Event (after hopping servers for about 30 times to trigger it...)
---
Yes, but they will almost always unshare themselves within a few seconds even though your stats remain buffed
---
Not if its a .50
---
Conan is made and published by Funcom, ARK is published by wildcard.
---
This is neither of those.
---
Yes, because the way you are expressing yourself and the content of your post, it seems like you are very young. If you are an adult and still, that is what is in your mind, then it does not bode well for you. I hope this explains my train of thought better.

I get where you are coming from about preferring evenly matched opponents. I've found that attacking bases at random is a quick way to stir up a fight. 
---
Tonight we had a good night. Raided a couple bases and finally had a 4 man squad come to our camp to and try to claim the bounty. An hour of back and forth and we manage to run them off. 
---
I wish we could just flag ourselves as raiders and show on the map. That way we can cut out the song and dance of terrorizing the locals. Not to say that can't be fun. 
---
Happy cake day m8
---
I belive Falout 4 got mechanic when you fast trevel to exact spot where your "WELCOME" little floor carpet were. You know, the ones people put in front of doors. I wonder, does it work in F76... anyone tryed it?
---
I know *why* players would want the vendor cap raising, what I don’t know is why BGS would do it. They’ve set it and the maximum amount of caps held low for a reason (to stop people accruing tens of thousands of caps too quickly?), why change this? 
---
Even I hang out with other players. Let's not start assuming that people are duping, just because they're playing a multiplayer game together. 
---
Mind blown. I had no idea. I'm going to have to try it.
---
I knew they'd pop off with negative charisma but I had no idea I could share above my "hard" CHA points.
---
There's a whole other mutation opportunity: Herd Mentality will give you +2 across the board while in a team. If Strange in Numbers isn't messing with it then it should be permanent (minus things like Rad-X, etc, of course).
---
Oh of course that'd do a butt load of damage. But at a bloodied state, I have just as much a chance to one shot them as they do me unless they're running an extremely similar setup. I'm running melee as well.
---
That's why noone has replaced TB yet. Many try or were already doing something similar alongside TB, but they don't get the spirit of TB's work. These people think that that being TB means being this "consumer advocate". Yet TB was much more. He was advocate for doing the right thing, moral thing. That's why these youtubers take the mantle of "consumer advocate" and base their content on AAA dev bashing and jumping on any outrage that comes from the community (without ever validating if the outrage is based on truth and therefore justified). The saying "customer is always right" is wrong, at least in the environment of entitled gamers of current internet age. TB had no issues calling out the fandom on their shit and defending a developer if he did the right thing.
---
Another example of a youtuber who has fallen (and was praised by his fandom as the next TB) is Sid Alpha. He has always had some kind of anti-corporate attitude (not that strong as Jim Stirling has, but still noticable) and he had a weak spot when it comes to Bethesda. But I respected him, because he was fair in most of his videos, was able to apologise for incorrect info and did validate his sources. But the last year has apparently went into his head. When we was reporting on the wrongdoing of indie devs, he can spend minutes on listing the sources and the events that lead to the point of the video. Yet his recent videos about AAA devs have less and less source validation. Or worse, he started to attack even other people who didn't bash the AAA devs enough. Like some journalist made a review of AC: Odyssey where he said something like "The start of the game is boring and confusing. Yet later it gets better and I rate the game possitively". Then Sid started to lambast him for being bad and incosistent journalist... And the straw that broke the camels back for me was the release of Fo76. Apparently Bethesda must have killed his dog or something like that, because with shadenfreude glee he started to report on single bad thing around the game. Well, there's a lot to report on, but he blew everything out of proportion. He made like 10 videos about it when he usually makes 1 or 2 about some particular game. Hell, he didn't even make (as far as I remember) a video about R\* abusing their employees (which itself is 10x worse than everything Bethesda has done, combined).
---
What do they do for you?
---
In Reddit in general you can save posts 
---
... you'll stop playing the game and being a part of the community? You'll make him feel bad for liking it? What were you going to say?
---
Look near the water and at the base of trees for violet. Snaptails turn into violet and so do mutated ferns (usually at the base of trees).
---
In the Cranberry bog the pitcher plants also give you violet and it floats on the water.
---
Bingo! This guy gets it. Bethesda has done a lot wrong, but that doesn't mean that everything is their fault. Especially the player's behavior which is out of their control.
---
You can use [xEdit](https://github.com/TES5Edit/TES5Edit) to open up the `.esm`. Then search for the keyword `ObjectTypeRecipe`(FormdID:003E1567) and go to the "Referenced By" tab. There you will see all the IDs that use this keyword (1098 of them right now).

hmm, let’s determine the age of this lad by the expression of his thoughts and his articulation. hmm, if you’re an adult doing that to people, doesn’t bode well for you. If i was 12, let’s entertain your ridiculous conclusion, why try to argue? Nothing better to do? 
---
I’m simply a humble player, warning others who actually put time and effort into something. For all I know, you’re the dude who’s trailing around destroying it. But hey, I don’t jump to conclusions. So place your opinion elsewhere, and pick on someone who (for your sake) actually gives a fuck.

Are the most reliable vendors that I have found. if you are lucky you can find it as a world spawn in flattwoods. as a reward for defending a workshop, and from government supply drops.
---
Funny you should say that, someone else already did that!
---
Ok so you clearly have no idea what you are talking about so let me explain to you like for 10 yo. Mods (expecially like this one) are the gate for injecting a hacks and there is no way to check if one user is legit and another uses this mod to hack. So banning all mod users is fair because they are breaking the rules even if they don't do it to break a game.
---
Wouldn't it be (.92 × 5 for each piece) × .8 × .7 × .55 ?

Does Perfect Storm even get affected by Friendly Fire? I know that crack shot only applies to pistols, and the 10MM SMG is considered a rifle by FO76's standards.

Yes on my spreadsheet under the individual tabs you can see the actual EID recipe name for each item.  I just didnt want to mix in cooking and chems with the others that we see in game as Plans vs Recipes.  
---
Thanks I take it you have gain 3 star legendary gear by not killing outright.
---
I heard the opposite. That you need to let them heal first
---
When you "place your opinion" in an open forum, other people can "place" their opinions on it to, it's how these things work.Seems like a lot of fuck was given though. Still , things generally are not fair, you will see as life goes on, even in games.

Endgame on Ps4 is fucked Fps between 5 - 15 ,

shit AI, shit Graphics, random disconnects, Survival elements are half assed imo, 
---
8/10 Great Game 
---
Did they trade? or keep dropping items? If you truly believe they were duping contact Bethesda Support fill out their form and send it in.
---
Definitely. I've received 3 star gear just smashing on a Gutsy with a pitchfork.
---
Cool? Why you still tryna argue with me old man. Sorry i’m 12 I don’t understand. Gonna go eat some candy and watch sesame street brb
---
Lol. Not every high level and low level is a duper with a stash limit of 600 some players have a 2nd character. 
---
I hope they never allow mod support and if they do, I hope there's a plethora of tests by Bethesda themselves to ensure gameplay integrity.
---
Mushrooms?
---
In case you don't know you can move your camp, even just a little, and place everything from storage. This saves you resources and only cost you the caps it cost you to move the camp. 
---
As far as the raiding goes it seems like you were at the wrong place at the wrong time. It sucks, but it happens. Gaining a bounty like that is a great way to start pvp action. Most people can't pass up anything past a couple hundred caps. 7000 caps is asking for the whole servers attention.
---
It's nice of you to warn people. Unfortunately, this type of thing tends to happen without warning and at random. 
---
Next time you should try to collect that bounty. One well placed orbital strike would have made you a nice little sum of caps. 
---
O_O well thats a new one I mean I have seen them heal before but I thought that was the no damage glitch in work healing them.

QED

Internet won't come in pipes any more. And gaming probably won't need a room. Unless they get in retro consoles, like a PS8 or Xbox... 4? I don't know what they're doing with their naming conventions.

I actually do have herd mentality, I forgot to list thay I guess. I'm not too sure what causes the perks to unshare themselves, but I used to sit at 7 charisma for awhile, and herd took me to 10 (s.i.n) and I could share my r3 perks...but they would keep unsharing within a few seconds.. it may be a bug with class freak/s.i.n. though..most likely is
---
Private servers or Player paid servers easiest way to fix that. If you create a character on a private/Player paid server, you can not use that character on any server but the one that's being hosted/paid for.
---
Ha lol sorry just had a funny image of a gusty flouting away while you chase it with a pitch fork.
---
I couldn't tell exactly from my vantage point because I didn't want to get too close and have them see me, but the high level player was crafting non stop and the low level was standing a couple feet away. 
---
After I shot a sniper round at the high level, the low level player immediately left the server, which I thought was fishy.
---
Because modders are better at the basics than BGS.
---
Get fucked fam
---
if you have trouble gettin in just send me a msg
---
A flaming pitchfork. 🔥
---
Likewise, super stimpacks don't work either.
---
Exactly. They just ride on the emotions surrounding the game, boosting the emotion even further, basically creating a feedback loop. And now it's in the state where people don't even verify their sources when something bad gets said about Bethesda because "everyone knows they are bad".
---
People were sceptical about Fo76 since the announcement with many salty FaNVboys trashtalking the game down. These youtubers cought the scent of negativity and now we are here.
---
On the other hand, games like C77 or RDR2 were talked about almost only possitively so they made videos praising how great the games are (or are going to be).
---
Noone of these clickbaiters even tries to stay neutral and objective. Because for the current internet crowd the two basic emotional states are outrage and adoration. And if a youtuber doesn't match their attitude, they are dismissed as a shill/hater. Basically the comminist "If you are not with us, you are against us".
---
I love the idea of nuking strange places. like Camden park.to Lewisburg. I get people want to fight the queen, and only fight white springs stuff
---
Yes, but how could they be logged on to both characters at once?
---
What's your point? I was just stating that I haven't had to pay for my Conan server to play "Singleplayer" Conan Exiles. But if Bethesda wanted to go the same route as Conan and allow players to have their own servers, I'd be fine with them monetizing it to make ends meet. 
---
If you mean that Bethesda couldn't do that because Fallout 76 isn't the same as those games, that's not true. They could easily do that and solo players would be happy as can be and multiplayer/coop people would continue as they are now. 
---
I think I experienced this yesterday.. Killed the queen, got some pretty nice loot, about 15 minutes after the server crashed and when I joined a new one I was back at Fissure Site Prime with none of the items I got.
---
Yeah I know, but I just thought I could warn others if they spot these 4 in their server. Some people don’t appreciate that. 
---
I didn’t want to collect the bounty cause I have pacifist and they have explosives, all of them. Probably had only a few caps on them anyway. I’d rather just get to the end game then pick up another game. Just something I wasn’t expecting to come home to after a long day at work 😂 Relaxation turned into me following these guys around. 
---
Possible Mule tbh. Honestly I just ignore the whole thing. I have a Mule character that I use to hold my legendaries that I would like to use for other builds but don't want to waste 15-25 LBs per weapon. I understand being upset and am glad you didn't jump the gun on it. It's more or less a judgement call on what you think you should do at the end of the day.
---
Hmm I see. PC users do not have that capability.
---
Thought so as I have not seen any other mod for that weapon. I have had a two shot 50 cal and a two shot smg. The 50 cal is great on my heavy build but my smg it terrible as it dropped on my level 15 charicter.
---
Thats because 76 is just a shitty mod of fallout 4 
---
8 bit is 1 byte
---
I'm saying you can't compare how bethesda is going to handle private servers based on your experiences with Conan Exiles or others experiences with ARK, we simply don't know anything.
---
They know modders will show how incompetent they were building this game, so they wont allow it. In fact they are treating modders as exploiters and banning them from the game.
---
But they will eventually offer modders a creation club spot so they can make a share out of modders work.
---
Oh, lol, I wasn't sure if it was on regular Reddit, so I booted it up on Chrome and couldn't find the save button, so just assumed it was exclusive to RiF
---
Understandable. I definitely don't want to get anyone in trouble that doesn't deserve it, so I won't report anyone unless I'm 100 percent certain they're doing something they shouldn't be doing.
---
Don't drop your power armor to use it, someone could get in anyway. Deploy it using X that way it's still considered yours
---
Thats pretty sweet, thanks for sharing ey.
---
ah the old iron dagger trick
---
yeah damn burst mode armor-piercing.
---
I learned my chameleon mutation works for players too. We made a hide n seek game out of it.
---
Teammates can see me always, but if you're out of passive mode, you're practically impossible to be found by enemies.
---
So.. the slender man PA bug is not really totally fixed... great.
---
I think that note is located inside Morgan town highscool. 
---
Yes, I did that once for an explosive mutant slaying Plasma Gatling, but it melts so fast, It was not worthwhile to me.  Sure it kills 3 mobs faster than the handmade, but I was able to kill many more mobs in the time it took to fast travel back to camp, swap perks, fast travel back, ect.   Plus not a viable weapon for things like Windigo Cave where need to stay for 20+ mins.  Only good vs bosses.
---
Other than that, never found any explosive weapons except for a 3 star cryolator with explosive.  (still confused on that one)
---
And? That means literally nothing.
---
What was the severity of this issue?
---
How common was this issue?
---
Did you conduct yourself appropriately?
---
How long did it take you to report it?
---
There are many things to determine whether or not your report warrants a response (especially considering the state this game is *still* in, they probably get thousands of bug reports each day). Just because they never replied that does not mean your bug report wasn't acknowledged.
---
But I mean if you'd rather use this game's subreddit as one massive bug report forum then go ahead, just makes all the incessant bitching and joking about how Fallout 76 is terrible look entirely justified.
---
Honestly if you’ve avoided the shitstorm up to now you might as well quit while you’re ahead and never visit this sub again
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad6bxr/bethesda_please_fix_this_gamebreaking_damage) should be No. 2 :)
---
Well I never had a roll back until yesterday so yeah, they are doing it.
---
can’t call everyone you disagree with 12. makes you a hypocrite. hope those 4 find your camp, then tell me how unfair the wasteland is. 
---
I used to follow youtube gaming news until last year. 2018 has tought me who the people I followed (or at least occasionally watched) really were - clickbaiters who would gladly twist the reality in order to gain views from the black-and-white-seeing audience.
---
Fo76? Blind hate!
---
RDR2? Blind adoration!
---
C77? Blind hype!
---
The Outer Worlds? Blind hate for Bethesda!
---
Screw those guys. I really hope that Bellular gets successfull with his gaming news channel. He is a guy who is really objective and neutral when reporting on WoW. Because of his indie dev studio and contacts in the gaming industry he has a special insight into the industry which allows him to not fall into the outrage mentality.
---
I never complained.
---
Yep. People are crazy to think Bethesda isn't putting any exploits highest on their list. Forced maintenance... that just likely means they were rushed.
---
Look at the last dupe fix. Not really fixed. Ergo, spreading the word didn't help at all and now the servers might be lagging more.
---
This mentality to "force" them can only stem from a teenagers mind who never has worked in a corporate setting.
---
Exactly. I don't know why it just started happening to me tonight, or why it's only the BOS under armor doing it. It might just be some value glitched for me and wont impact others. Just glad I can at least work around it.
---
Ill just do that probably then because no vendor is selling them to me at least D: thank you!
---
50 stimpaks? That many? I did the silo alone and I think it was fairly easy. Mustve used around 10 to 15 stimpaks at most.
---
i never said you did. 💅 
---
I havent tried train station, i mostly go to phoenix but ill try it now! Thank you and hope it spawns randomly somehow D: 
---
I tried to report a bug. Can't remember what it was now but there was no option to report a bug. So I put it as gameplay and in my description wrote "trying to report a bug but there is no bug report option" so they email me back with instructions on how to access bug reporting on their support website. It took 3 goes of "you don't understand the report a bug feature isn't there" and 2 screenshots for them to finally say of crap how about we submit that for you. 
---
Hello and congratulations on your very first video game purchase. Being new to purchasing games you should know that there's a history of titles having their prices eventually reduced. Large box editions with bonus material and even digital versions.
---
I hope you purchase a second game someday but keep in mind that its pricing may change over time.
---
Again, congratulations on your very first video game purchase!
---
"Fucking. Shut. Up."
---
Naw. Game's bad, bubba.
---
Hahaha, this game fucking blows in every single direction, such shit game, unfixable, downvote me u pathetic fanboyz lol.
---
There is nothing to compare, it's a suggestion. Obviously it's up to Bethesda how they want to handle it, assuming they do it at all. 
---
If those 4 find my camp, then tell you what ? I never complained about PvP in the game, thus what would i have to tell you in that event ?
---
Well yeah at least you can work around it. But its a boomer that this bug is coming from fallout 4 and that havent manage to completely remove it from the game.
---
Just like FO4 it seems.   This was the purpose of the them in that game.
---
He had some good points with mass effect and battlefront back in the day, but even with those, he beat a dead horse. Since I have the unpopular opinion that when comparing fallout 76 to any other game in the same genre, it is very playable and has a huge amount of content, these types of videos are even more baffling to me and just scream click bate.
---
I think dupers were in scramble mode before the patch, precisely. Or training with the new exploit.
---
2 xboxes
---
dude, you’re thinking way too hard about it 😂 
---
I mean, maaaybe we should have investigated and banned the dupers. If only someone had suggested that before this patch....
---
Pathetic Bethesda’s programmers. Let modders fix the game again.
---
Not sure if it makes a difference, but I'm on PS4.
---
Thanks for sharing, some guy posted it a month ago or so.
---
They haven’t confirmed that there will also be a patch for fo4 to fix this issue have they?
---
I honestly can't see that happening successfully, unlike Ark or Rust it's a lot more difficult from an individual players perspective. Each server would be a cesspool of random incompatible mods in a mod list nobody is really happy with, that'll turn into "You should add this" and it completely ruins both the enjoyable experience and playable experience of the game.
---
R/woooosh
---
im 99% sure i bought a non duped one as its a western revolver, those arent super wanted (i know people will still buy them and such, but they arent homemades/shotguns ect) and the problem with your think is, is that unlike you I would start back at 0%, as this gun is the only one i have.
---
Very true i say
---
My [shotgun build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f693887&amp;d=sd2so2sp2sb2su2pc2pe2e80e11e00ef2ei1ce0cu0ev0ic4ih2a71s72as2l71lu2lt1&amp;w=c71&amp;n=PA%20Shotgun) did pretty well for leveling and does very well endgame. Swap in Inspirational until you unlock all the perks you want for faster leveling. 
---
There are a few ways to level faster:
---
1)Cranberry Juice +5% XP - Cranberries grow in the field outside Aaronholt Homestead
---
2)Canned Meat Stew +5% XP - Feed the people event in Morgantown
---
3)Leader Bobblehead +5% XP - check the interactive map for spawn locations
---
4)Super Mutants - They give the most XP/kill of any mob in each level range, except SB's. Drop plenty of ammo, guns, and gunpowder.
---
5)Whitesprings - Sheer number of ghouls with other players farming them all you need to do is throw Molotov's or spray bullets from a distance. Make sure your in pacifist mode, and try to get a team. 
---
The excavator set is a nice boost to have once you can craft it. There are several quests that give legendaries as rewards but the item is capped to your current level in most cases, so you may consider saving those for later. The Mistress of Mysteries quest chain gives a sword and pistol that can be recrafted to higher level versions as you level up.
---
Bands of high level players roam Appalachia as low level players fight against the waves of high level monsters left in their wake.
---
Camps have become targets of roaming bands of raiders. Do not build near the roads, junk piles, or trading post. You have been warned.
---
Not all is bad. Other, kinder, high level players have begun banding together to arm the Christmas newbs against the onslaught of the growing raider bands. 
---
Of course, the duping menace persist. The public outcry against these players have become more fervent. Some fear a witch hunt is imminent as vigilante players attempt to dole out justice to suspected dupers. 
---
Finally anticipation grows as rumors of a vault opening spread through Appalachia. Though nothing is confirmed, it doesn't stop the people from wondering what fresh horror waits behind those vault doors.
---
TL;DR - Gameplay is pretty much what is was at launch. BGS seems to be focusing on patching. People are creating their own content until something is released. It's a precarious time to be a new player in FO76.
---
I don't see the point you're tying to make.
---
That engine is perfectly capable of doing multiplayer (even MMO) stuff, which DAoC proved.
---
The reason it's not working out here is not the engine, it's the man power bethesda put behind and the complete ignorance to basic client-server rules like "never trust the client".
---
If at least one of their team had watched the post mortem for ultima online during development, most of the technical issues we're seeing wouldn't be there.
---
I'm thinking normally, it's not too hard to think about this topic, is it ? Was trying to understand your reasoning, but all i see is more immature name calling, not an ounce of sense. I hope , for your sake, that you are also very young.
---
Nothing you said about the level 230 and level 5 sounds fishy to me. They might be voice-chatting outside of the game. If you're introducing someone to the game you might be tempted to craft and mod some starter gear for them. Or the low level could be a mule as others suggested.
---
Crafting would be suspicious to me if the low level was doing it and gained multiple levels worth of of XP. That'd take a lot of mats. But I can't think of what the high level could craft that'd be suspicious.
---
I got it at my first ever try finding the vendor ... is it realy that rare? 
---
Hold my beer, I'm going to go challenge eBay to PVP over Star Wars Galaxies credits.
---
this shit again? can’t call everyone you disagree with a child. it’s a childish thing to do. 
---
Hence the problem overall with mods being allowed in general. What is allowed what isn't. It's gonna be rough if they do plan to let modders in and do what they want. 
---
I'm not against mods in the slightest, Bethesda's modding community is probably one of the best if not the best mod community. I'm just not sure where the good ground is here.
---
I laughed thanks 
---
"Wind's howling"
---
the fact that these people keep trying new ways to dupe, they need perma account bans lol. NO MORE KID GLOVES.
---
My first camp was on a cliff. I had to climb up everytime.
---
My second camp is on a lakes edge. Now I start from the middle of the lake everytime. 
---
We need fast travel mats
---
This is the best advice you can give to anyone new.
---
Also, don't try to compare yourself to others. Someone is always going to be faster, stronger, better equipped, better weapons, better armor. Just enjoy the game and you will get more out of it and will get to those levels in your own time.
---
When hitting things in V.A.T.S., you'll build up your critical meter (white bar), once it's full, press space to toggle crit. Next hit will be a near 100% guaranteed hit + it will be critical (2x damage).
---
Again, QED
---
Maybe "oficial" means just BSA files. And not DLLs or memory editors (like this mod above, or ReShade), because memory editors could also mean cheats and haxbois and scriptkidz stuff.
---
judging by your way to end a convo, you’re old as hell. wanna bring in age go ahead bud. don’t forget to kiss your grandkids goodnight. 😘 
---
My level 40 toon is using a pistol V.A.T.S./Crit build. It's fun, a bit underwhelming but fun
---
I feel your pain. Been there 6 times a day average with server hops/disconnects. Picked up every plan but 2 of the Marine pieces... at least trapper plans keep finding their way to the overseer's camp.
---
I don't really get what you're trying to say :) but eBay is a different beast then site specificaly for selling vydia game items
---
I'd change 10 for "Making energy weapons do more damage or scale with int".
---
Don't act naive. If your post on fo76 subreddit gets 2.5k upvotes, bethesda staff reviewing the issue is guaranteed. OP is smart to do that. If you are just lazy and content with automated copy/paste response, be my guest. But I doubt it's going to change anything
---
&gt; cheats and haxbois and scriptkidz
---
In a game where there is multiple in game methods of duping and stacking infinite bobblehead bonuses permanently I don't think that is the real issue.  
---
Interesting.  I haven't been to overseer's camp in a while.  Ill check.  I wonder if other players are dropping it there.  Thats nice.
---
Im keeping a spreadsheet of Plans ive learned so I dont duplicate buy.  I have more modifications than I do base plans and its maddening!

I posted to help people and give a heads up, and there is arguing on my post. Like really? 
---
It's not just a mod. It's a DLL. I have \~12 mods installed with no problems but I'd never touch a DLL. Too risky.
---
Rank three stealth, Escape artist, and a piece of chameleon armor pretty much makes you a ghost to enemies. I've had super mutants run past a foot away from me and keep on going towards another teammate. 
---
I believe I've nailed down the problem with the perk card sharing and herd mentality. Pop an addictol, and see if that fixes your level 3  perk share. Addiction is -1 charisma and doesn't show up under status or effects of whatever it's called. Any other adjustments hide it from the stats screen as well. Herd mentality doesn't share perks reliably that I've seen ever. Same goes for unyielding. Magnetic personality and +charisma armor will share reliably, unless you get in power armor. I've had 5 friends fix their sharing issues with an addictol though.
---
Can confirm the strange in numbers problem.
---
nope, everyone in this subreddit lives in a bubble
---
really everyone treats you people like zoo animals 
---
I raised my luck special and now finding 2 fusion cores in toolboxes sometimes.   Might just be coincidence?
---
I miss Herbivore... Now I got carnivore which is more convenient, but I earned alot more xp making the soups all the time.
---
See, this is all the more reason why we need to band together, hell even go undercover and get in cosy with these reprobate then REPORT REPORT REPORT.  We need to be the eyes and ears, if everyone is snitching then they'll never be safe.
---
I am not sure if having a full budget stops you from taming a creature but a good way to check is if you have enough budget to built on turret then you probably have enough to tame.
---
The more likely reason you havent found an animal to tame is because you cant just tame any animal, it has to be an independently spawned creature that only appears in certain areas and needs to be at least half you level.
---
Rather then write the whole thing out again I will just send you to the link here from someone else asking the similar question:
---

Good luck!!

600 hours in, still no sign of any jetpack. Still no TSE weapon.
---
If he had entered the room, he’d already be banned due to detectable corrupted game files from what banned players have reported in the last few days evidently. I am curious what proves this player has duped, exploited etc. If he one shot you in pacifist, that could be suspect activity but doesn’t mean much with current circulation of free items and all the “goody bags” these guys are dropping around and leaving in global containers. 
---
It also appears these masks have been duped or crafted and then handed out on a mass scale sometime recently, I mention this because it appears this is the only other way this player could have obtained these cosmetic items, meaning they can’t be guilty of dev room exploitation (at least on the account you encountered)
---
From your post it seems that some jerk talked some shit and had some leet loots, but not it didn’t seem certain they did much else. Saying he/she is an exploitation culprit based upon the evidence shared appears to be a stretch. 
---
I feel it’s easy to get on here any agree without asking questions, but it’s tough to generate a fair tempered dialogue when appearing as the opposition in the comments. So don’t worry I’m prepared to be downvoted a couple hundred times for asking at all.
---
May we inquire what the player said to you during their “bragging”?
---
May we inquire further details about your evidence?
---
It's more a disappointed view on the state of preordering collectors edition games.. 
---
6 months in advance of release and 3 days after its announced it's impossible. 
---
2 months after launch, if the game failed its flooded everywhere again, including the "limited" versions. 
---
As I said I have one copy already and just ordered a second helmet so to speak..
---
I already own 2 copies of 76 this will be my third now, I'll give the key to a mate and keep the helmet.

If it crashes every hour on all consoles and PC, it's barely functional. That's how I see it. 
---
Eh, I use an addictol every day. Wasn't the problem for me.  But yeah addiction doesn't show on your effects.
---
OP is right and wrong, there is still a dupe methods but it’s no longer takes 2-3 people, when they saw the fix some what worked on PC they reverted the change from speed duping back to your average rollback duping. Speed duping crashed the server less so than solo rollback duping.
---
OP is misguided by something he saw, but it’s doesn’t mean his post isn’t still relevant 
---
The monetisation of fallout 76 is just aesthetic items in the atomic shop. Updates are free and you can't purchase caps.
---
There's no logical reason that Bethesda would make any less money from adding private servers.
---
In fact, if they are clever they will middle-man the hosting privileges renting private servers to their own player base.
---
If by monetisation, you were referring purely to in-game money, (caps:value) you would also be incorrect because the ability is already available easily by creating a new character and transferring items, respawning worlds every 20hrs? I think. AND the simple fact that a super high level player CAN POSSIBLY trade an item worth 3000c to a low level player for a dishrag. (Or just give it to them).
---
Unless I have completely defiled your point please explain how an existing monetary system in fallout could prevent private servers becoming an enterprise for Bethesda.
---
I quite frankly think the idea is so profitable its unlikely not to happen.
---
I'd rather they raise the wallet cap. 200 caps per vendor quickly adds up. I'm stuck at 25K caps and lost all reason to go to vendors.  
---
I can't spend it on plans either, since I'm not sure of which ones I know. There is nothing else to buy.
---
All legendaries heal when they hit 50% HP. those that don't aren't working correctly. 
---
I don't think that letting it heal or not make a difference. It has what it has. I've killed them outright and let them heal. In 600 hours of gameplay neither has made a difference. 99 times out of 100 no matter how many stars the enemy has they will drop a one, maybe a 2 star weapon. 
---
can’t beat them, drop to their level. Seriously can’t call everyone a child because they bring up valid points that contradict their argument. So what we are young? i can tell by the way you type and the words you use you are not 12. so don’t worry about him. he doesn’t complain about pvp because he probably one shots everyone. just wants to feel superior.
---
you did good warning others. It was quite a story, from your point of view. seemed kinda funny how everyone was swarming around him at Seneca. 
---
&gt; This is Yongyea's video? If so, this was lazy content from him. 
---
Same as all the other "content" he ever produced. Don't forget to like, subscribe and pay a mandatory 5$ Patreon fee btw.
---
so this is why i got rolled back. . . darn those duppers.
---
I don't think Bethesda is as QoL hostile as you imagine it...
---
Good call.
---
The Auto Grenade Launcher is even better, I assume it has a larger area effect. I’ve been able to take out all of them on a console with a single 40mm, as opposed to 2-3 shots with a TSE shotgun. 
---
I heard the opposite (that it had to heal), so I wonder if both rumors are wrong and it's just random.
---
1) PS4 Pro. 
---
Just got kicked out again near the end of an event. Nice. Now it's been 'searching for world' for 15 minutes. 
---
Yeah, he needs the T51B set and the nuka cola paint!
---
I kept power attacking the The Heart and noticed it draining the core severely.
---
No, why should it even?. I managed to turn off water with the config, which is odd, but its just a config setting. You should be able to use some config lines from fallout 4, but you have to create a custome.ini for some stuff and use the prefs.ini for others ... its weird i know.
---
But....why? Seriously, did anyone complain about supply drops being unlocked and available for everyone? It's not like they give good loot either that is worthwhile for one person to be the only one to get it.
---
Like, i probably have about 50 requisitions right now, and i barely ever see them dropped, because they each reward about the same as a single boss enemy.
---
Bethesda's logic continues to be baffling, i see.
---
I’ve played over 100 hours and I reckon I’ve only played 8 hours with someone else

https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-private-servers/
---
"Todd Howard confirmed again that private servers are part of the plan. "That is definitely something that we are doing. We are committed to it. It's not just having a private server, it's being able to mod it," he said in a Q&amp;A panel. "It's something that, given the online nature of it, is going to be very, very complicated, but we're committed to it and we've been starting to design what that system is going to look like. It's a complicated problem but one that we're one-hundred-percent committed to solving."
---
I suggest that you remove the silencer. More range makes SB's a lot faster to kill.
---
I like the idea.  I'd like if we could all kinda stick to a system, so that it's easier and we could pass that knowledge to new players.  For me, I put stuff i don't need that could be helpful to someone else in blue suitcases at the major train stations (watoga and pleasant valley).  In the case of commonly accessed vendors that don't have blue suitcases, I put stuff in the cash register (vendor Phoenix in Watoga shopping plaza and Wallace at Harper's Ferry.)  It would be nice if the community could develop a common system.  The game is only a couple months old, so maybe in a year's time a system will become pretty concrete.
---
I was just about to log out with my last circuit of the watoga legendaries and ran across a lvl 50 that just finished the Mayor For A Day quest.  I waved, asked if he could hear me (was having issues communicating with a team-mate earlier where I could hear him but he couldn't hear me and vice versa), got a yes and hello from a gentleman with a midwestern accent, and told him I dumped a bunch of legendary stuff I didn't need in Phoenix's cash register in case he was interested in any of it.  He asked what Phoenix was, so I said follow me and he was thrilled to find a new vendor (who of course was smashing the hell out of a handful of robots) and was amazed at the amount of free stuff just laying in the till.  (I'd been farming in hopes of a two shot handmade for about 2 hours with server hopping, so I had everything from a mole gauntlet to a gauss rifle to wooden and marine armor pieces, mostly one star stuff that I had to dump for weight reasons.)  I threw in the expensive stuff 200+ cap stuff I was planning to vendor the next day and he flipped his wig on a furious/mutants/+250 reload DR auto grenade launcher.  I would have stashed it for upcoming camp vending, but the weight was something I couldn't sustain.  I planned on vendoring it at either Watoga Station or Phoenix the next day and hopefully it would have been scooped up quickly, but this was actually better.  The guy was over the moon and thanked me profusely.  He offered to give it back to me in exchange for caps, but honestly I've bought everything I really want aside from elusive X-01 mods and the expensive camp signage plans, so I'd rather make someone's day and continue earning caps through salvage.  He promised to pay it forward to someone else, and that was the best payment he could have given.
---
Yeah haha, I ended up following them around to kinda see what they were up to. 8 people were joining together to climb up there. I came home from work, wanted to relax and I ended up watching that absolute shit show. I had to bring my wife in to watch with me cause I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was actually the funniest shit I have ever seen in that game. 
---
One person with a jet pack got up there and swung at the one dude who wasn’t wanted, and immediately got dropped. It was about half an hour of some 4 way mexican standoff before I guess they got bored and the wanted disconnected and the other 3 quickly followed. 
---
Where is the ice cooler?
---
You can never have enough screws, steel and springs. Oh, and plastic if you’re planning on using shotguns.
---
Using crafting stations at owned workshops makes you wanted?? 
---
All good, wait until everyone is asleep, and you might be two seconds behind them, congrats on the young family, 
---
Yeah i've literarily been downvoted and argued against for pointing out  that the Gatling gun's sights are placed incorrectly, and other dumb stuff.
---
damn you had to bring in the miss’? also, “4 way mexican standoff” is the funniest line i’ve ever heard. wish i was in to actually see that.
---
I was trading plans with my friend and then rollback happened. All plans returned to me, and my friend didn't lose anything too. That's how dupe works now probably
---
FUckkkkkkkk I couldn't even...
---
That perk doesnt do what you think it does, it is beyond useless. It only reduces the PENALTY of being hungry or thirsty, not make you need less food or drinks.. So put another perk instead..
---
Two consoles or pc's games in the same household that both habe the game. Digital bought games can be shared in the same household on consoles.
---
The other possibility is that you let a trusted friend log in on the mule.
---
Google led me here. Brenda Song maybe??
---
Please also fix the random stuttering and freezing as well.
---
Some dude had a fatman, but the place where the wanted camp was was so high up on the hard to get part that ALL our weapons were just out of range. Some people were only there to watch because they saw half the server crowded there. Some had their camp destroyed and wanted to watch if they got him. It was insane. 
---
It's most likely because if they add this as a feature and it breaks something it is beths fault. They can't just go and add everything without testing it to some degree. If a mod breaks something it is the users fault. 
---
If you’re talking about the floating in the air being an exploit, my player does that. It’s just a mix of having the mutations bird bones and marsupial as well as having the card that adds 25% to your positive mutation effects when your teammates have mutations as well. I don’t think it’s supposed to stack but the more people in my party with mutations the crazier my floating gets. It can be quite a nuisance at times since I’m a melee character, I get stuck in the air when I jump for what seems like forever.  
---
I'm on ps4 and kill the queen pretty regularly, let me know if you wanna team up sometime
---
I one shotted a 3\* legendary super mutant last night. It dropped a 3\* railrifle. 
---
It looks like there's a smaller can inside of it. They're trying to break free from each other.

You have 2 instances of fallout 76 running and alt tab between the 2.
---
As I said at the time, when even less people had cottoned onto it - this is an endgame weapon meant for people who no longer are concerned with materials for repair and/or ammo. I haven't even played in like two weeks, although it's endlessly amusing to me that people are still trying to learn what is and isn't BiS. By the time all my friends quit weeks ago this was (so we thought) common knowledge.
---
damn, i wonder where that legend is now or if he’s got reddit. only time i can recall seeing close to that many people was the very first time i launched on the SBQ. 
---
And they are getting banned as well.
---
I don’t think Bethesda factored in that some people would want to help others. I suggested a ‘here’s a gift’ emote because trying to give newbies any stuff is a pantomime dance of waving, pointing at your brown bag gift with you gun and looking like you’re being a jerk! So, yes! Anything that will get the ‘I’m friendly’ message across I’m all for!
---
Done plenty, haven't seen this. 
---
You sure you don't have a stalker? 
---
very illuminating comment
---
If you're on PC I have an alt that's currently perfect level to find handmade on vendors, aint got no caps on him anymore or I'd buy it for you like I've done for other high levels that missed it but if you can wait until I server hop into the plan and trade the caps I'll happily get it for you.
---
Hard to ignore when I keep having server issues.
---
The doggie bag is awesome and obvious, but disappears when you drop another bag far away, log out or get a server drop.  Putting the items into a persistent container, such as a blue suitcase at a train station, stays there even after you quit for the day, lose connection or server hop.  That's why I don't really like the doggy bag system at a whitesprings golf club nuke farm.  If someone loses connection, the bag the dropped disappears.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Hey check your stash I had the same thing happen to me and I thought I lost it but it was in there. 
---
I hope nowhere near my camp! Only cost me a little bit of wood and steel. Just thought I would warn those who actually put hard to get materials into their camp. Those with fusion generators and such. 
---
Hey thanks bro, I love your ideas and will keep trying to improve my audio editing skills enough to implement them.  Audacity is pretty cool but I am prior Infantry with that "Grunt see grunt smash" mentality sometimes heh.
---
From reading the last few weeks it appears they spawn at vendors(seen 10+ spawns today so I believe they upped the % maybe?) , the can spawn rarely in the world, but are also are rewards from completing events. I have yet to read a player confirm an enemy corpse “drop” the plan.
---
Some of the players who said they often do events have even reported to find they have multiple copies of this plan in their inventory when checking their notes after a heavy play session. I would look into that a little more before spending all the caps. A player may allow you to buy it for less that the vendor if someone is looking to make caps but still hand you a price break. Lowest you can get the vendor bots it’s 8600 Caps for it I believe so any amount less than that is a bargain if you are choosing to pay for it.
---
The very best of luck to you.
---
Thanks for the encouragement brother, what is the fallout feed though?  I haven't heard of it and would love some linkies for checking out!
---
 I have seen 4 and bought 2 Hand Mage Gun plans. This on an alt from level 15 to level 20 at Watoga Station and Harper's Ferry. I have not seen one since leveling past 20.. 
---
I think the way it works is that plans are tied to whoever is in the area first. If you have already picked them up then they will only reappear if someone else has spawned them in.
---
Things that make the silo run faster:
---
Exit elevator, look for old keycard. Get the biometric scan. Erase keycard, make new keycard, swipe at terminal. Basically ignore quest markers and do it faster.
---
Ignore any enemies and turrets outside of main rooms.
---
Use any explosive weapon on mainframe cores.
---
Forget maming new ones at a tinker bench, that shit is bugged to hell, it takes two damaged mainframe cores to make 1 new one. There are ALWAYS 15-20 new mainframe cores dotted around the main room and it's side rooms. Look on top of shelves, in nooks and crannies. Once you've done it a few times you'll be able to get all 15 very quickly indeed.
---
Best tip for a FAST launch? Do it solo. Solo run = less enemies, less interference.
---
From exiting elevator to nuke launch is roughly 20 minutes. 25 if I take the time to backtrack to a weapons workbench and repair my knife. Yeah I do the entire thing with a Vampires Cultist Dagger. Just like everywhere else, melee is king in a silo.
---
Use power amour. Not for any extra protection or anything, purely so that if something DOES go wrong, you can stimpak instantly
---
Focus on any Assaultrons and Gutsies first, they attackl from range and can wreck one of the mission robots. Robo-brains and protectrons feel the need to get much closer and they will not easily defeat the robot personnel, certainly not before you can arrive  as back-up. 
---
would you be a console user?

You to bring the gun of knowledge and reasoning to the knife fight of unsupported speculation.

So unfair it will probably cause instability in the reddit servers.

Share exp if there are other people around. The last nuke zone I was in there were four or five people including myself and each of us took turns getting our shots in. That way everyone gets exp.
---
well i’m sure someone on this website really appreciate you for saving their ass in the future. even if that guy arguing didn’t. makes me mad some people are that ignorant to what’s really goin on. in your post you never complained. and he got real salty when you tried to tell him that like dude accept that you’re wrong. take the L.

Weapon Artisan lvl 3. Repair the ripper, chainsaw, buzzblade and drill. Enjoy having some ridiculously powerful weapons in your hand for a while. As they drop back down to 100% health the damage drops off again too. 
---
Was this much earlier today? Because this happened to me! I died at the whitesprings in a nuke zone, went back and accidentally looted someone elses bag, stopped looting and looked around for my actual bag but it was gone. 
---
Haha if that was legit us, thats funny. You can keep whatever junk you found if it was mine and Im sorry I looted yours. I was wearing the prototype hazmat suit and using the revolver.
---
they will make and paralell with they will shut down the costly official servers. so u will get a single player game without content.
---
but... kido... if they reroll the whole server they cant duplicate.
---
You don't need to report it.
---
Bethesda are perfectly capable if seeing who is doing what.
---
At level 58 I started over so I could get the handmade.  I thought it would be quicker to start over instead of server hopping the vendor and to get patrol duty to start. I also wanted to move points around and had other cards to unlock. [This was posted on here about a week ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ad1n16/handmade_rifle_plans_level_locked_at_harpers/).   Since then I've been using it as a guide to get different weapons at Harper's Ferry.  I hit level 20 over the weekend and since then I haven't seen it at the vendor.  Same thing for the other weapons that are listed as being 15-19.  
---
Thanks I appreciate it, again. I’d rather not have arguing on my post trying to help out..but can’t help those who feel the need. Hey we should team up sometime. My IGN is Saber, I’ve never nuked the SBQ but when i’m 30 levels higher with a better weapon I’d really like to. 
---
Is it possible to use critical accidentally? Because I've seen my critical meter not full, even though I've never used in on purpose? Or maybe meter lowers by itself?
---
ill add you tomorrow, keep and eye out for luficr. and just hmu when you wanna take her on :)

Gotta catch em all!

Haha they will never do that, fo76 is a single player fallout but with mp tacked on so they have the excuse of always online drm
---
The perks Butcher's Bounty (chance to find more meat on animal corpses), Can Do! (...more canned food in food containers), Pharma Farma (...more chems in chem containers) and Scrounger (...more ammo in ammo containers) do not apply automatically but instead give you an additional and easy to overlook prompt to "search" the container... o_O
---
It does say so on the perk cards, actually, but the wording is quite ambiguous.
---
Bud, your life ain't worth a stimpak, but I have one I watered down here...

Saw some cunt posting on Facebook the other day he was selling TSE weapons for REAL world cash that he had blatantly duped, how do I know they were Duped? Because he had TSE in every weapon and they were literally in the hundreds 500 Dragons, 700 gatling guns, 400 Handmades all in all he had well over 10,000 weapons he had duped... where's his lifetime ban Bethesda?

How the hell am I supposed to feed all the ~~pigeons~~ new players in Flatwoods now. Personally I don't give a damn if someone 'robs' me of shit materiel, but that won't stop asshats from luring out scrubs to extinguish.
---
If they ignored all of their actual bug reports and relied on only popular posts on their subreddit then they would get absolutely nothing done. What's naive is believing that your only way of reporting bugs is to make a popular post on reddit.
---
Got disconnected last night and found my last several minutes of vendoring/scrapping had been rolled back. Annoying. 
---
Agreed
---
It wouldn't for me. Deleting a couple of turrets fixed it.
---
Only if they're persistent. I want my camp to stay up. 
---
I think the point he was making was speed duping(keep the boards via trading them to a friend) crashed servers way less because it was more of an overload DC than a lag DC. 
---
The old method you’d have to wait for ~5 minutes for yourself to disconnect all the while the server is getting increasingly more laggy until it gets rid of the load(you). With speed duping you could force crash by overloading the data on your character via trading an item with another. This was much faster and didn’t lead to nearly as much server instability as an older rollback method.
---
The new method is really one of the oldest methods, people just never did it because of how tedious and truly not even worth the time it is 
---
this would make sense to me, on server disconnects at least, but how would this explain the fact that it takes *15 minutes* to get back on a new server after crashing to desktop, even after restarting the game and even my laptop? just yesterday in the afternoon i tried to log in and i tried all of my friends’ servers, a separate one, and on all of them i got the notification “Connection failed: Timed out while waiting for server to respond.” and when i finally got on my friend’s server after 15 mins, i died from invisible enemies because it took the server several minutes to render them.
---
with so many people having the same problems on all servers, i find it slightly hard to believe that it’s *just* the dupers who crash the servers.
---
Not a huge fan of it. 
---
Largely for logistical reasons. Access to VATS *alone* gives Vault Dweller's an insane tactical advantage that no survivors would have, to mention nothing of the video game handling of health and defense. Belching Betty is a reasonable trial for a solo player that goes straight to trivial if you really care to make it so. 
---
But for "real world" survivors with no fancy tech? They could be good, prepared, and *completely useful to the Responder cause* without tossing them in on a suicide run. 
---
Yeah, it's a suicide run. If you fail, not only do the responders have no way to bail you out, but they're not even going to try. 
---
It's absolute insanity. 
---
"Accidentally", maybe, since it's the same button as jump, it's easy to try and jump while in V.A.T.S. and kitting.
---
Apart from logging out of the game or using it, I don't think it vanishes.
---
Only if they are pre CU credits!
---
&gt; Every fucking server on PS4.
---
Funny.  Never happened to me.
---
You obviously hang around in a nasty neighbourhood.
---
Looks consensual to me.
---
Scrapping unneeded ammo would be nice.
---
As for selling it, perhaps they could create some kind of craftable bulk pack to sell like with the valueless junk items. 
---
I really liked the raider segment on your first episode. REDACTED
---
wthell..
---
No worries my dude, this is how I have fun with games :-)  Finding interesting little things to explore and deep diving them with a community!
---
I experienced a couple of server roll backs last night. Had gone to my armour bench, crafted some new gear, disconnected and then was back at wavy willards and hadn't got any newly crafted armour. Lost about 10mins of progress. 
---
Honestly I think If you want to be PA 24/7 you should have to spec into it. Otherwise there's literally no drawback. 
---
Or just have a second account. FO76 doesn't prevent you from running two instances on the same machine on PC if you startup from the EXE rather than the launcher. 
---
I’d like to agree, this also has been my experience. I server hop for vendor plan spawns and sometimes I find the plans the vendor might sell on the counter or rack near them. This appears to be depending on if this area had yet to be looted on the current server.
---
Turns out there have likely been new players duping causing the disconnects and rollbacks I experienced: (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afox6o/i_already_reported_this_to_bethesda_the/)
---
eBay isn’t breaking Bethesda’s terms of service so what grounds is there?  eBay isn’t playing the game, so never agreed to their t&amp;c’s.
---
It’s not illegal, so no court would hold any action up.
---
It was sent out via email tho 
---
The nice thing is that that build can easily transition into a build with any of the fast hit weapons, chainsaw, drill, ripper, or mr handy.  So you can play around until you find just the right flavor :-)
---
You probably have not got rid of him - he'll be back. Find another one and it should replace him.
---
white spring during a nuke respawn a when a new player enters the area. 
---
Unless the special editions like this are really limited this happens.  For different reasons stores end up with them and due to the price they sit around.  After a month or 2 from launch the collectors have already got theirs and the re-sellers have already sold them or found they can't, probably leading to why the stores have so many if they were returned.  The larger collectors editions like this take up space stores don't have much of.  So the prices get cut just to move them.  
---
I think I’m the same. I mean the most expensive thing in game atm is the lettering plan which sells for between 9k-11k so that’s only like a week of consistently selling and that’s the extreme. Mutations, from vendors, are like ~3.5k ish so like three days max. 
---
I would like to build up some bank but I do understand that if they set the cap too high then everything selling between players potentially becomes super expensive too. 
---
You aren't alone, I had a lot of help in the lowest levels (5-10) with random supply drops, I pay it forward by dumping them randomly around Flatwoods. Depending on when this change occurred, I may have made a few unwilling criminals already.

Thank you for the shares, I never knew this was out there but will binge on it all week!

Actually, I might be wrong.  I may have picked a lock within the workshop boundary.  (I didn't even notice it was owned until I got killed out of nowhere)  I just finished making some ammo at the tinker's bench and got killed out of nowhere.  I thought I was being trolled until I saw the 10 caps taken out as I died.  I respawned and apologized, and the player graciously gave me back my steel, cloth and lead scrap after I explained that I was pretty low on ammo after a Scorched Earth event.  He even gave me the couple dozen .45 and 5.56 he had on him.
---
I wish we got a warning when entering an owned workshop, or it was more obvious on the map (maybe turn the icon red?).  I physically walked there and had no idea the space was owned.
---
the real reality answer right here
---
If Bethesda would come out and say mods are not OK, then your opinion might be justifiable. But they haven't done that so far. This mod doesn't unbalance anything or affect other players. 
---
So it’s alternating because it can’t decide? D:
---
God I can't wait to fight my fellow vault dwellers over $30 cash and two cans of dog food, oh boy

I left the lead extractor and water purifiers unlocked at my camp.  Slapped the word "loot" on extractor and that we're all in this together poster too.
---
Though others on here may say that is commie talk and blow up the base again.
---
Yeah, I use the same location but the blue bag next to the stash. Usually ammo and weapons I don't use like Gauss, 10mm, .44, .50 ball but also plans and armour. I've also set up an open camp for anyone that wants to use it. Up the road from the station just short of the Blackwater mine on the left just don't pick the black berries or rice because they're set up for mobs to attack and destroy rather than the cooking station in front of my arty.

Fallout 4, too.

I loved rooting those down when they came on the radio. 
---
Even knowing everyone is dead, I would have been really into doing the same in 76. It really does make sense to me that at least someone would have used a low powered repeater transmitter to scream into the void in a hopeless situation. 
---
The problem really is more on their side. I've played WoW for years and very rarely ever get disconnected. I can play for many hours at a time no problem. FO76 constantly disconnects. It's really the worst online game I've played as far as disconnects go. The problem is compounded by the abysmal loading screens.
---
radiated water can’t make adhesives from a chemical standpoint..?
---
Heh thanks, I was having fun with it.  This was my first attempt to try and create more than one "character" in my mind while I was writing it up and then voicing it and I can already see I need to work on pacing, better voice differentiation (probably record each segment separately and combine them later into the finished hole with some "Wasteland Shoutouts" or something).  The raider was fun because I want to keep the show clean while still allowing the characters to speak how they normally would if it WERE real and that seemed a fair exchange and funny too!
---
I just figured it was dupers hitting it hard due to the update that's coming Tuesday. 
---
Or they could just install a program that detects unauthorised edits and prevents you from logging in. Banning someone from using software they paid for is an extreme method that should be reserved for actual hackers. 
---
Yes, it's possible as Space is used for jumping. Big thx for information!

When you're in build mode, anything that you give over that has a tiny arrow next to it, you can use the arrow keys (on PC, not sure what the button is for consoles) to scroll right/left to see other versions. 
---
The big plain wall has versions with door frames and windows. There are a lot of different chairs within each category, etc. 
---
Unfortunately there are no half vertical walls, though there are half and quarter floor pieces... but also no half or quarter foundations. 
---
They can’t shut the sites down directly unless they start using any of Bethesda’s registered/copyrighted IP. They have no legal means of doing so as what they’re doing isn’t illegal. 
---
What they need to do however is have someone pose as a buyer and get the username of the seller and just permaban them. Also circulating a rumor about actions against the buyers would chill the market, even if it’s not true or even possible to trace the sales. 
---
I don't know where it might be for other PA sets but the X-01 version is carried by the Enclave bunker and can be gotten fairly easily with some server hopping.
---
Honestly if you think this community is toxic you should play games like Rust. Fo76 has been one of my most enjoyable experiences yet regarding meeting other players. No idea how you have such a bad experience regarding pvp, maybe i'm just lucky?

i rem when silo was really long and hard
---
On ps4 all the time. My last three nuke runs: twice I blue-screened in the silo and on the third time I launched the nuke and blue-screened five mins after the blast.
---
Which would "catch" the handful that speak on an open mic, some of whom could be teens who just sound really young. 
---
The kids who play solo or even in teams who get bullied, and don't reveal themselves, from your perspective that's not a problem anyway, because they shouldn't be there. 
---
Haven't disconnected once since the patch either on PC man, no reason for the downvotes.
---
Nice job. Not everyone saw the one from a month ago, so this is very cool. 
---
You were able to do the previous glitch solo. It was just slightly easier with multiple people. 
---
Duping caused lag while they crafted things, like it does whenever you craft multiple things quickly (i.e. like last night, when I crafted a bunch of 10mm SMG to scrap to learn the mods). But, at least with the old method, crashing the server meant the dupe would likely fail.
---
My personal, _unfounded_ guess at the current lag issues is that one, or some, of the fixes in the last patch have caused a performance degradation somewhere, and they accepted the hit in favour of removing exploits/other bugs.
---
Good thing that's not the reality. 
---
Taking over a workshop and defending a workshop events will give you recipes for decorations for your camp.
---
You can earn the recipes for the different generators by doing the power up the power plant events.  Keep running them till you can build that fusion generator.
---
That sounds like a great weapon.  
---
If you're on PC and come across a 2 shot handmade, either a single effect or whatever, I'll pay a lot for it.  I don't use VATS a lot and modded my close quarters handmade with aligned mods for a good combo of hip-fire and recoil.  I do treasure the armor piercing/mutants gun I have, and may still keep it after I try out my "grail" gun, but I can't know which one I prefer until I try both.

Hey thanks mate, I appreciate that!  When I saw all the negativity being thrown at the game, even by those doing content FOR the community, I decided it was time to put my own spin on it.  We all know the launch wasn't great in a lot of ways but rather than focusing on the negative, especially since Bethesda is fixing that and listening to the community, I have chosen to share my love of this game by making videos around the questions and help I most often see people needing here along with my own takes on things.  Now I am having a blast in AND out of the wasteland :-)
---
This is my theory. Before this patch, they tried preventing the duping by limiting item counts that cause the player to disconnect and roll back - to little effect. One component of the method was to be able to connect back to the same instance via a friend or other player. However, if you and the other person are kicked out, or the top 5 people of your recent tab shows, there is far less chance the glitch can go through. This also means if you happen to show up on the duper's list, you can get booted from across the map too.
---
Try changing the server and then let your buddy join your world. A few days ago me and my buddy noticed it's often server related for us, so if we just join a new server it usually works again. 
---
I've heard about the couple who married in the game - they got wedding rings and priest wearing Nuka-Cola T-51b ;) All in underground chapell in Mothman Museum...
---
No need to fret, you’ll meet that special lady who will join you on your quests, and perhaps end up stealing all your bottle caps..and bringing high level enemies to your camp. But worth it none the less. :) 
---
I Did this yesterday and it worked WONDERS!
---
Nah, I usually do the same because after you play a while you realize rads and diseases aren't debilitating like they were or are in other games but it takes time and experience in the game to get to that point so a guide like this helps folks out, especially if they are going for full submersion.  If their character were real, unless they are playing a psychopath maybe, they probably WOULD eat anything they could if they were starving but if they could eat well and healthy food instead they probably would.
---
I wouldn't object to making some *unmarked* no-build spheres for this reason. 
---
Everyone is supposed to have this quest experience. How you react is totally up to you, of course, but blocking CAMP builds around some set pieces doesn't seem a big or obtrusive ask.

I have never been accused of cheating but I've had a lot of angry messages from randoms because I killed them and stole their junk or took over their workshop. 
---
I don't get the all the pvp hate because players are mostly protected by the slap system and it's someone's own fault if he/she fights back. I won't grief so that basically means I wil kill you once or twice to get your junk. The only reason to keep killing is when someone keeps coming back to get revenge.
---
That would be great, do you have a username I can add? 
---
That..is awesome. 
---
forreal man? I would appreciate that! Are you sure you dont want anything? I have some plans or give u same amount bottlecaps vendor ask? ill add you rn!

Low-key where all my atoms are going. Photo mode is weirdly addictive.

No. Closest we get to sharing the experience is me telling her about my adventures in the Toxic Valley, and she rolling her eyes. Fair enough, though.
---
The Simple Modern Bed is available from Pendleton at Studio 58 in Whitesprings. 
---
Yeah, I have a similar view as well. Like there are bits and pieces but no one even comes close as an overall package (at least on video - TB was a bit of a wreck on social media).
---
Sid Alpha has the tone of TB but there doesn't seem to be that gravitas and attention to detail as you alluded to. 
---
Jim has the consumer's back (I think some indie's as well but the man love to paint targets too so it's hard to remember). However he comes of as too abrasive for my tastes sometimes. 
---
I thought it might be Yong at one stage a while back but WAY mistaken on that. It's not even the 76 coverage. Just the way he kept bashing on about the Guild Wars person. Yeah, we got it. She's not a good actor in this. No need to relitigate ALL past transgressions to get to the outrage of the day. He keeps bringing up shit like he has no choice.
---
Who knows, maybe one day. Heck, maybe never. Either way, TB's loss has be felt.
---
That would be shooting the messenger.
---
Ok, thats cool. They could turn this into new PVP event, where people who steal your loot, has to make to X location to clear his wanted level and the owner has to hunt him down. If he does, the wanted drops what he took from chest. Sadly tho, with current supply drops, there is nothing valuable in those. Make supply drops sacred and put legendary into them and boom, here you go- New entertaining event to play.

She's an independent boss babe who sells Mary Kay, she don't need a king.

I found *Instigating* useful when you can hit a full health enemy and remove significant chunks of its health. Black powders and The Dragon are especially good candidates. Pistols, SMGs, Assault rifles, Miniguns, LMGs, Gatling, .50Cal are much less so due to the low initial damage. However, enemies such as Scorchbeasts and Queens are less likely a good target because they are almost immediately out of their full health and thus Instigating has no effect. I wish the effect would give a 1% wiggle room.
---
Take her to the top of Seneca, show her the view and she will fall in love I promise you! 
---
I thought they banned account with weird amounts of weight , is this true ? For pc since the patch cane earlier 
---
Lol you just described every fallout conversation I have with my wife
---
I'm not a duper, but your idea to wipe TSE weapons is plain stupid. It's part of the game and the fact that 95% of them are duped, doesn't change fact they're suppose to be in the game.
---
Todd Howard has already said that mod support will happen and it will be private servers, and it will be about a year after the game launched. Players can download and install mods right now that are client side only.  Personally I'd prefer that Bethesda gets the game and current servers fixed before starting on allowing server side mods. 
---
I guess people who expected Fallout 5 or Fortnite were dissapointed and are slowly going back to where they came from. Also, the game launch was not smooth, there were lots of bugs which are now mostly patched. In itself, FO76 is an excellent game and a daring step for Bethesda.
---
Can confirm.
---
Prior to one of the patches, there were 2 Barn Building Sets. One was lower priced and opened up the Advanced Power Connection stuff. The higher priced one is the actual Barn Building Set. So if you originally bought 2 of the cheaper ones, that wouldn't work. Since the patch, if you buy it again (it's now the only one named that) it should let you learn it.

Harper's Ferry.

*Allowing players to demolish exploiting camps without getting wanted.
---
The game did not fail.
---
See, I do like what you're saying and I agree, and you'll see that most people that play think the same, but they just have the problem that Bethesda didn't put enough effort into a fairly stable game on release. You guys started playing after a major update that fixed a lot of bugs, before then the bugs were really bad. With that being said, Bethesda is doing a good job at getting fallout to where it should be 
---
My bad if the WoW thing isn't an actual issue. However, I could just as easily open the search window to a year or spend more than the couple of minutes searching within the last month. 
---
The point still stands - it's laughable to think that ANY online multiplayer dev, no matter their experience, has their shit on lockdown to the point that exploits (and in the specific case duping) aren't an issue. Systems are too complex and the human element is always a wild card to screw things up or find kinks in the armour.
---
I know people will really dislike me saying this.
---
I would happily give up my TSE shotgun to see them competely ended. As well as a return to a more balanced game and player market.
---
We started this a few nights ago.. mostly due to the fact that sometimes dropped stuff disappears. Tldr; Always use in world containers for dropping. 
---
Killed one yesterday in that strange pinky forest in Cranberry Bog - can't show photo, because I'm at work right now, but mine died on his face, so I could only photo his non-from-this-world back ;)
---
So much this. Don't forget Egghead causing the same problems as herd mentality.
---
Kerwood Mine is mostly coal as well mate, at least 20-30 nodes.  I went there looking for iron one day and was sadly disappointed :-p
---
Not a duper but fuck your "wipe everything" bullshit
---
Actual hackers use mods so banning everyone who uses mods is certain way to ban hackers and it is smart thing to do. Don't want to be banned? Well don't modify a game which is against the rules.
---
The lack of servers located in Australia/New Zealand is disappointing.
---
Yeah, I can share 3s when I gaincharisma with un yielding and thanks to the radiation Bar buff it stays even when I’m dying and respawning
---
Goddamn, really?? I was wondering why it never works
---
understandable... My first experience with it wasn't good.
---
I come into these threads solely to look at downvoted comments, no idea how anyone can condone this sort of behaviour.
---
Scrappin ma pipboy always makes the ole noggin feel better of couras
---
This is against the rules which says that modifying game files is forbidden so as you said my opinion is justified.
---
I can't belive that ppl are not aware of this.
---
With classfreak its negative effects are completely negated. However this does cause issues with barbarian and evasive.
---
This regardless of what youtubers say. The hate has alot of grounds surrounding the game. Yes its an amazing game with possibly a good future.
---
There's no need to go through every. single. misdeed. I'm surprised that he doesn't have one of those clickable boxes linking back to the video of all the incidences he's reference. He seems the type.
---
A few would have been plenty for context but it just feels like he's punching down now. Hardly speaks highly of his character.
---
Facts, go print’em!!!! Preach! Preach! Preach!
---
P.S. To answer back: Epic Games - Fortnite: Save The World’s bug regarding the missing tabs tabachal (sp?) the one bug has 50+ pages. Stating they have a fix, and it’s coming next patch, with no dang hint of it’s release. AAA’s always make sure the micro transaction cash-grab is at full swing/first to get fix, but the “bugs”: we’re working on them, and they need time! Smh
---
I am going to mention this in next weeks podcast to try and spread the love, good idea mate!
---
I see! That would mean that it correctly shaves off the percentages from the negative side of Herd Mentality.
---
My girlfriend is not even allowed in the room when i Fallout.
---
SBQ is easier the less people are in the event, she scales with every player up until 16.
---
With all my perks the TSE dragon base damage is 2500. It doesn't matter what the player has I always one shot them. It's just rediculous lol
---
I know of one couple that started playing together but essentially stopped because their 1 year old daughter demand too much time. We all just talked on discord to not annoy others in the area with baby crying or squealing noises 
---
Ingame though they looked like two dudes walking around - nothing special 
---
If it means fixing or improving the game then surely getting your inventory wiped is worth it to you.
---
Curb your greed, please.
---
I hope this is a bug, because it is annoying.  I do not want to be fighting over loot drops, Bethesda.  This is not Rust or Ark, stop it.
---
That explains why my pink one was suddenly gone 
---
I hit just under 300 hours before I realized you can lock the terminals in Converted Munitions Factory workshop and Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm workshop.
---
Then you have to expect to get griefed by purists. So be it.
---
This is one of those things that I really, *really,* hope gets implemented soon. I mean sure, I can rip raw lead and iron out of the ground and twiddle a beaker around to make *new* cartridges, but heaven help me if I want to pull out some bullets, pour out some powder, *melt all that lead and brass,* and make new ammunition.
---
I praise the lord, but all the ammunition I have to pass out is trash.
---
It is not stupid. It is an appropriate action to take if a weapon intended to be incredibly rare is now incredibly common and easy to acquire through third party means. That's called a game breaking issue.
---
Sorry but, am I being shamed for sharing what I’ve learned this week and asking questions? 
---
Is it bad for me to find out I or the OP may be wrong about what we think we know?  
---
Is it bad for you, myself, the poster/readers to learn something new and possibly become better informed? 
---
Agreed Ive got over 200 hours logged and you know what. Id be okay if they wiped everything from my inventory and stash. If it meant fixing the economy and pvp. Hell they could take all my caps too. Just let me keep my level and perks.wouldnt mind starting from scratch be like a breath of fresh air
---
Thank you for your beautiful words, friend.
---
Same here.  It's possible that some patch has since tweaked that "condition" to trigger Falsely Accused, but I know that I had a collar in my inventory and wasn't wearing it when I ran into the robots.
---
To each his own. 
---
And make active power armor parts unscrappable :'(
---
That’s amazing 😅
---
I would agree with a reset as long as I can keep my character's facial features.
---
Because /r/Fallout can't stand seeing us over here having fun.
---
u/lonevaultwanderer

u/jessbethesda
---
This is the most important issue that has ever existed in the whole game that requires to be patched. Disconnects can wait, we need our multi colored hard hats !
---
Exactly. Nothing wrong with starting over especially if it improves the game and makes it more enjoyable.
---
Well getting the word out would also increase instability. OP probably should have been more specific though.
---
Did it drop anything noteworthy?
---
This actually allowed me to successfully avoid wasting caps *and* get the plans for the oil lantern yesterday! 
---
Just wanted to let you know that the fruits of your labour have paid off :-) 
---
There is a certain poetic justice in hunting dupers with duped items.
---
Sure duper’s selling stuff has made things easier, but I have had way more fun using explosive weapons and not getting my shit kicked in since I bought one from a seller at flatwoods. Having these duper’s sell materials is also a plus because if I wanted to grind long hours for minimal result I’d play destiny/destiny 2 and feel bad about myself. 
---
I've never seen an online game that didn't have a lack of content or bugs at launch, the circlejerk is real unfortunately. 
---
I’m pretty sure I have extras of both of those. Add me on pc : lazarus801 and I’ll give them to you tomorrow or the next day. 
---
I just can't take anyone who calls Fallout 76 a "fantastic game" seriously...
---
I have almost the same spec as you 1070, 2700x, 32GB Ram, Win 10. My game does the same as you described when in  Charleston , but other places as well. Only been playing this game for 2 days and it was smooth while I was in the starting area.
---
It’s the mating season for iron scrap based loot
---
Wonderful, it’s mating dance for trash cans
---
Watch as it tries to entice an enameled pot 
---
With the dance successful they will now retreat 
---
And in the ruins they will conceive 
---
a beautiful aluminum can and a tin can 
---
The trash can will then stand outside again 
---
Strange in Numbers?
---
Good find - but rather disappointing. 
---
I was hoping for the Flatwoods Monster to NOT be an actual extraterrestrial...that's sooo cheap and cliche.
---
How funny would it be if there was a human (now ghoulified) hoaxer inside?
---
Add naming Power Armor or giving an option to differentiate it. 
---
Nope... Fuck that.
---
I'd toss that game in the garbage
---
My build focuses around two handed and non automatic. They way I do, or I've started doing it now is focusing my build on weapons and carry weight and any useful perks to survive (such as radiation heals me, or the stranger revives me) and then if I need any other perks such as lock picking or using less building materials, I just switch them out when I need to 
---
I finished the game, AMA.
---
(Before dupes, server glitches, and grief patches)
---
Just kidding. I played solo for the most, and had a TSE friend help me tnough the rest.
---
Ask me fuck all.
---
I don't like it because I dont find it fun. It just seems like a lazy cash grab to me.
---
Bloody hell, I forgot about the part where you need the weapons themselves to craft the upgrades ones, and sold them for stash space yesterday  &gt;_&lt; 
---
r/anotherpostaboutduping
---
Your loss, pal.
---
It depends on how much you play and what you are doing during that time.  If you spent a lot of your active playtime farming Whitesprings it's not surprising to me at all.  The only ones I have seen that make me wonder are the folks sitting at over 1000 levels.  That blows my mind lol
---
What exactly do you mean? My English is not so perfect 😅
---
Bethesda "Working on it" is hardly an endorsement though!
---
Step 1 - have 2 or 3 friends
---
Step 2 - have 1 person sell item to one of the 3 vender machines in enclave 
---
Step 3 - have everyone in your group of 3 buy that item (has 30secs to do so) (original seller buys item back after the other 2 have brought it
---
Step 4 - rinse and repeat 
---
My camp budget was full and I still managed to tame a deathclaw. Pets definitely count as part of your budget though, so if the deathclaw takes up 10% of my budget, now my budget would be overflowed to 110% filled. 
---
The animals you were trying to tame, were they single spawns in those random-event spawn locations?
---
Take this as a lesson. Never preorder anything and wait for the price to drop. It always will.
---
Dammit man, drink some water
---
I upvoted this post excited for you to get your jetpack,  but you seem unhappy? I don’t understand what happened. 
---
Thanks for the responses just wanted to confirm it wasn't just me for some reason
---
It's something i have thought about alot lately. The game cannot have a future like this. I would do my part to make sure it does. The secondary market for real money and the duping crisis is causing TSE weapons to be in every corner of the world. Its not fun when everyone is using the weapons one shotting everything.
---
To qoute a favortie 
---
* When everyone is super... then no one is*.
---
Meaning everyone having the ultimate god tier weapons as rendered everything meaninglessness. 
---
i have killed 3 already. 
---
Me and my Fiancé do! Its the whole reason we wanted the game in the first place; We line up two TVs in front of the couch and play together, we always have so much fun. 
---
People in 1000s are 100% exploiters.
---
There just haven't been enought time to reach those levels since the release.
---
They can, but there is no option to pool resources and build with one master list of materials. This is a basic expectation.
---
Also, I am no troll. Just an avid Fallout fan who is disappointed and annoyed by the contempt shown by Bethesda’s management and lack of care.
---
to fix it, simply unequip and re-equip power armor parts.
---
Not really.  
---
Just junk (Literal junk items that you just scrap no other purpose), same as the Mothman.
---
Bullyhunters.
---
I downvoted because I thought you were going to explain how to do it. It’s now an upvote, at least we have someone on this sub who knows not to explain glitches
---
Or just paraphrase Jim Sterling latest video as usual.
---
Making this game "one shot wonder" is not the only sin that the dupers cause, but the far larger sin is that they f*ck up the servers, and ruin this game for everyone. 
---
If you support the dupers, you are a part of the problem.
---
As a previous duped TSE weapon buyer........ DELETE MY GUN AND BAN THE DUPERS!
---
Same. After a bunch of ‘server not responding’, I was on my way to a trio I saw parked together at Morgantown airport - a 100+, an 80+ and a level 7.  Crashed before I could reach them.  
---
I leave stuff in containers all the time I don't want for others.
---
The fastest you can move (apparently there is a power armor mod for faster movement, but I personally haven't seen it so I won't include it here) is by having Speed Demon mutation, maxed out Gun Runner perk, and the Charisma perk that increases movement speed when on a team. Some people say Speed Demon and Gun Runner don't stack, but I've tested using both while a friend only have Speed Demon, and it definitely appears to stack as I won 5/5 point-to-point foot races.
---
If you want a SUPER mobile build, then also consider using the Marsupial mutation (as jump height is based off of your character's current speed, so with that faster speed from SD mutation and GR perk, you can jump extremely far and high) and AP Regen gear. 
---
With a setup like that you can almost constantly sprint (with two or three AP Regen gear items it literally takes a very quick 1-2 second stop to completely regen all your AP from empty) at +60% movement speed and be able to leap over pretty much any obstacle in your way.
---
This mobility build is devastating when combined with powerful close-range weaponry, as you leave your target with no time to react before you're already on top of them dishing out the damage. And in the cases where you picked the wrong fight, you can retreat just as quickly
---
He said he did report it. With a game like 76, they don’t have time to read every ticket
---
He does have more numbers and more numbers always means more smarterer.
---
One there will always be dupping because of how the servers are and rollback. It's not gonna change, all they can do is crack down on people and dropp that ban hammer more. 
---
That being said a wipe would kill the player base faster than dupping. Any casual would be gone, only the straight edge OCD can't exploit even the tiniest thing plus the traders would be around.
---
Last, the market sucked before, people were charging ungodly prices for things even when trade cap was 5k. I'm happy that we have a more diverse market now, and apparently a lot are because at least on xbone people are using the heck out of it. 
---
In that case I'll buy all your 556 and 45;)
---
Sure. Having to make a living is real, too.
---
On the odd occassion hubby and i play together. We get the chance when our son is at school and hubby has a day off, I'll hop onto son's xbox and off we go.
---
I also play it with my son, although he  has his own friends who like other games they enjoy, or they don't want the ancient parent roaming the wasteland with them! So it's pretty rare.
---
We really should get another tv, our whole family could wander the wastes then. 
---
No problem, i was drop them.
---
I'll be on in a couple hours, if u got any plans i dont already have and if dont need them i dont mind having them
---
Yes, the weapon broke
---
Maybe you broke your gun
---
Even though i enjoy my self found explosive combat rifle, and took me like 100 server hops to get my X-01 jetpack, i would be ok with a server hop since the duping got to a point where ot's unfixable. But that only cones with Bethesda fixing duping for good and i'm not sure they can handle that. It's pointless to wipe if people will find new ways to dupe items.
---
This just happened to me a couple days ago when I tried to find the vendor there. Walked away with over 500 pounds of sell loot but lost the junk bag in despawn bugged on some tragic deaths. 
---
Detailed ticket submitted.  Thanks!
---
I mean, I play this with my friend, and on occasion with his mom
---
Personally, I was given a marine armor helmet and a trapper hood.
---
Bethesda missed out a section so let me add it for everyone...
---
**NEW BUGS:**
---
Introduced a bug where you can't share cards. They share but then keep unsharing themselves.
---
Increased the amount of server disconnects to be timed exactly when they're most annoying to you!
---
Not enough CTD's so we decided to increase their regularity. We also did nothing about fixing the issue where when one team member crashes,  it resets their progress on the current mission - oh sorry, did that happen to you on that awful DMV mission some idiot here at Bethesda thought up? Oooopsy! \[giggles in the background\]
---
**ADDITIONAL FIXES**
---
Renamed the game from Fallout 76 to Fallout: Troll U!
---
The pace where I spawn versus the place where my team mates spawn is different. I always spawn in the lake and catch a disease. They always spawn under the foundation.
---
I just haven’t done the quest yet. I’ve only just got to level 50. 
---
I must be missimg something at this point. My handmade and shotty have 4 or 5 times that damage but it takes much more time to down a scorched beast. I don't use vats nor automatic fire.
---
I wish that they changed every TSE weapon to propaganda flyer with a picture of Mao TSE Tung.
---
what
---
Here is the full list: https://pastebin.com/n4uRPcc2  
---
You will have to split them in the categories yourself though ;)
---
Just wipe all tse weapons 
---
If it is a pay-to-play system where someone will need to subscribe on a monthly basis for a server, and associated admin access, then Bethesda won't get much money out of that, but it will be an additional revenue stream for little effort. Those arrangements tend to the the result of a game developer partnering with a third party such as gportal. If it is simply an on-the-fly thing where a public server is turned invite-only, there isn't any money there.  At any rate, for 76 to ever support mods that affect more than the UI/graphics, private servers will HAVE to be a thing. There is no chance of Bethesda allowing players to mod themselves gear in a public setting when you consider they ban people for getting into qasmoke
---
dude i saw someone say that they do that the chances of me seeing someone who found one of his things
---
I added you on ps4 (mjserybusiness my tag) and yes of course :D and just message me when you get on! thank you again
---
is there any leg ones as my leg armour is all broke
---
&gt;Why people believe this to be so impossible?
---
The worst thing, imo, is that everyone is so sure of their opinion (which is a problem that extends far beyond fo76). This is all speculation at this point.
---
Release of wow might have been bumpy, but that was the release. Also it was released 14 years ago. They basically set the standard to MMOs afterwards. Do you honestly want to compare this game to WoW? One of the most popular online RPGs ever?
---
The only huge issue wow had btw is they didn't expect millions of players that their server simply couldn't handle. There was also duping in the beginning sure, but you know they also built their game so those things were easy to track automatically so they could weed exploiters out pretty well.
---
And here we are more than 10 years later and fallout 76 still doesn't know how to implement the basics of an online game.
---
Oh btw, another thing that wow doesn't ever do is random server crashes, I still play it and it's very stable, unlike "you aren't even going to notice the servers" fallout 76.
---
I could go on but why bother, you came up with a very bad comparison, better luck next time.
---
no here is another post from some crybaby who needs to make sure he is liked. No-one really cares what your opinion is, please stop trying to shove it down everyones throat. The people who like this game will continue to like it regardless of your opinion.
---
RIP FO76 online community
---
No, I'm going to rage on the ones who BUY items with real money. They are the true evils in all this.
---
yeah but it is no longer in my inventory with the slash through it showing that it needs repair.
---
Yeh i figured you may just not have got around to it yet (why i made my comment a PSA to all players) in which case you really have spoiled it for yourself lol.

---
My current build after I got bored of TSE shotgun. 
---
the build uses weightless gear and a combat knife if you want to up the ninjaness swap glow sight for fire in the hole and use throwing knives/tomahawks
---
Killing them too fast sometimes causes them not to drop legendary gear at all.
---
Strange
---
Then why reply? You obviously care as much as I do.
---
Good to know I guess it's one of those problems that can't really be identified.
---
Nope it glitched then t posed, it wouldn't register anything to pick up
---
How is your experience of the FO universe different now from say....FO4?
---
Are you not just exploring the wasteland, building a base then doing the off quest? Because the game loop is EXACTLY the fucking same as FO4. The exact same. 
---
honestly they said they were working on push to talk and we got that as well as 100 other plus bug fixes we got - I mean they have a ways to go and some of the patches seem to cause more harm then good but they are trying 
---
Exiles is a different beast, but I suspect that if 76 ever supports mods that affect more than the UI, it will need to be more like Exiles. 
---
By scamming consumers?
---
You make a fair point. It doesn't however make my point any less true. I get it, Free States ain't free lol I just think if you're hunting dupers for profit, take off the badge because you're no better than a common raider.
---
Never happened to me. But in full agreement. They should she have a confirmation screen. 
---
Didn't think SBQ spawned at WS? 
---
FO3 and FO4 were fantastic games....My experience with FO76 is the same experience. 
---
Mostly exploring, killing stuff, building my base then the odd quest when I feel I run out of steam on self imposed tasks. Pretty much the exact same game loop as any other Fallout. 
---
Only now, I have random dudes showing up at my base for a chat....or to sell me wood. 
---
End game currently.
---
》 Launch nukes and grind them for resources and legendaries.
---
》Collect all plans.
---
》 Raise your level to a point you have all perk cards you want.
---
》 Base done up as much as you want.
---
》Soon Vault diving (2019)
---
》 PvP ( Don't reccomend it until its sorted out), duping is completely ended, bobblehead stacking is ended and TSE weapons are corrected and not on mass.
---
》 Player Market ( Don't reccomend its currently pretty fucked) dupers kinda crashed it. Hopefully they can balance out alot of the issues around it and eliminate the mass stocks of duped items.
---
Uum last thing i would reccomend is helping others. I spend most of my time helping people under level 50. It does me well and makes me happy.
---
But that fucks anyone that legitimately found one, also people that purchased them not knowing 100% whether they are duped or not.
---
Make them obsolete by introducing 5* legendaries and increase level of weapons to 100
---
No level cap but I can only craft/find level 40 weapons?
---
Weird... I see level 62-95 enemies... 
---
they did say they were working on it in 2 of these posts though 
---
They didn't actually patch the disconnection issue nor did they patch the dupe, they simply patched stacking of certain craftables that caused a single player to lag out. The dupe is by no means fixed, nor is forcibly disconnecting. Now we have hundreds of people upset that they can't dupe, looking for new ways to force disconnections, and the current one disconnects entire servers instead of just them. Classic Bethesda.
---
Did you make this post to actually talk about what you think the future content will be or hear other people's opinions about it? Or are just complaining to complain? We've had enough of the latter. That horse has been beaten to a pulp. Yes, the game is a little light on side quests and the story is a bit hard to follow since you have to read terminals and listen to holotapes when the game doesn't pause like in previous games(for obvious reasons). I've still managed to have fun though. 
---
Well I played a little bit this weekend and servers would disconnect me every 40 mins or so, don't know if it's related but I've never had disconnections before. 
---
My buddy did mention that the day before we bought it a major patch dropped with lots of bug fixes etc. 
---
no ones claiming it wasn't sent just that it was a moderator not bethesda the company who said it 
---
That's pretty good information! Do you mean with unyielding armor and Death Man Sprint perk max lvl it will work to? Cause DMS gives you 20% move speed when your health is under 50% and unyielding effect give you Agility and endurance. Also good for AP 🤔
---
I am enjoying the game alot.  I can handle the bugs and server disconnects, i don't have much disconnects anyways.  Its just funny how some people keep posting messages like 'omg  this game sucks, its so buggy,  i am wasting my time playing this'.. Well maybe they should play another game instead of wasting their time posting those messages. 
---
Correct. Creation Club will likely be the only non-UI mods on public servers. On private servers, with server-locked characters, the sky is literally the limit.
---
Because it seems to upset u guys more to know there are actually people enjoying the game, other than that i had 5 mins to spare in between watching shows and saw ur post. well back to it, enjoy.
---
So this is why i kept dcing and would be rolled back a bit.
---
So, as an individual, my opinion means nothing because it's already been stated? Is that how Reddit, and this subreddit, works?
---
enclave has those 4000 cap mutation serums you can keep injecting yourself with those till you have all of the ones you want
---
Yes, me too. I'm away for a week, but i have some1 who will log onto my ps4, but I need to know what items are up, especially the time sensitive 1s
---
Go to the enclave bunker an look for the presidential office. Then look at the terminals there and you'll get an idea of what's next... Probably even one of the real bosses and of the game.
---
needs MOAR purifiers (gotta get my diluted stimpak fix man) 
---
p.s. i have 10 of the medium purifiers, yes i know i have an issue lol
---
So wait a year until the issues are ironed out. I think I'll move on. Thanks for your reply.
---
No one wants your opinion. Everyone has their own already. The subreddit is for discussions. Your opinion isn't really a discussion. It just is.
---
They stole a lot of them already. Ideas straight up robbed.
---
Increasing the weapon levels to 100 wouldnt be a bad idea. 
---
I'm not upset you're enjoying it. I'm saying I'm not. What's the difference?
---
Yeah, it's not "fantastic game", it's fantastic game.
---
Thats what im trying to say
---
Oh. Only your opinion is valid. Ok. Thanks.
---
In World Of Warcraft, most of the weapons and armor you get are "bind on pickup" - which means that once obtained from a boss or as a quest reward only this character can use it. Trading these items is not possible. However, they can be sold to a vendor or scrapped for materials (which can be traded). Some usually less powerful items are "bind on equip"... those can be traded, but as soon as someone equips them, they become bound to them. Some items are bound to your account and can be mailed and used by your alts. Most of the materials used for crafting can be traded, except rare and hard to obtain endgame materials.
---
Here's your solution, Bethesda.
---
honestly out of the last 10 nukes I saw and 5 more I helped launch only 1 of them went to whitespring the rest went at the prime fissure which now seems like the place to drop it at least where I am 
---
also I feel the vendor limits should be raised by doing the faction quests which in turn also unlock more items in their vendors instead of having them level based 
---
the loot bag through the floor is really annoying 
---
honestly for TSE weapons it should be either explosive or two shot and the explosive damage should be based off the damage of the bullet at its location I'm tired of seeing shotgun snipers firing from max range doing 1 point of shotgun and death by explosion 
---
&gt;I was mid carnage at the golf course during a scorch beast queen battle
---
I dont think that's right
---
Unfortunately am PC and my wife is Xbox and PS4  (She also has a mid-range PC i built her to get her into PC Gaming). Still am not complaining, as at least she games! Just wish sometimes we had the same taste in games and systems! :-( 
---
That's how opinions work. 
---
Like their latest "patch" that patched in breaking sharing cards, more server disconnects and more CTD's.? lol  How about prioitising the big bugs first? I don't care a glowing one is giving more XP when there are massive issues that need addressing as well as increasing the storage limit.
---
No problem man the game won't be for everyone. Even i have had my doubts but i have met some amazinf people in game. I mainly still enjoy the game because of the friends i have made in 76.
---
I hope when you check back its in a more full state. Otherwise i would like to reccomend a few games i found really fun lately.
---
The new Assasin Creed game is truly amazing. It spun me out since i have not enjoyed them since blackflag.
---
Witcher 3 and expacs i like to play this again atleast once a year. I truly love this game and i am sure you have played it but well worth replays.
---
Dark Souls 3 is probably one of my favourite games of a time. It's a pretty good game that fills the need for challenge.
---
I usually have mine close to the golf house (people love it for scrapping) and suprisingly, it's being missed by the nuke most of the time. Even if it is hit, it only costs \~50 caps to move it, which repaires it completely... 
---
make an album instead of having a bunch of links
---
Launching a nuke should affect the server, we should all take a few rads at the very least, the sky should darken and the mood should change.
---
Knowing Bethesda’s engine, that’s how you’ll lose 200lb of trade material via a Brahmin falling through a mountain.
---
indeed. The session was topped off by the server crashing with the sbq at like 2 percent health. That made the whole a run a giant kick in the nuts. 
---
How can it be the same experience when they are fundamentally two different games?
---
is this quest broken?
---
i can build 3 - this is no problem but after 3, i loose my mats but dont get any more.
---
My first, accidental visit to whitespring (level 20): disconnect while inside the building, spawn in nuke, instant death.
---
What?
---
Where did you get it that cheap? 2nd hand or?
---
i’m sure i did as it acted like i was placing a prefab in my camp
---
As soon as PSN agrees with me, I will give it a shot (ain't been able to log in all weekend, wife has been happy)
---
Get a mic, conversation makes a huge difference with other players.
---
Mate this game was never about your character going on some massive singleplayer epic story. Wrong game, bud. 
---
There was definitely a scorch beast with the sonic spamming  and radioactive shit dusting, 
---
I've platinumed DS3 and finished W3 and all dlcs. Thanks for the advice.
---
Shame I can't say a game is shit after p,aging so many great games without dickheads trying to stifle the conversation. It's great you went the obvious, personal route and tried to give alternatives. 
---
i have already checked and i can only see my excavator and t60 but i’ll check again 
---
[PS4] Yesterday night 23 CET EU server approx with 9 players I was fighting against the queen scorchbeast in the relevant event. We killed the beast at -2 seconds to the end of the event and we got the xp points. However short after the beast disappeared living us the time to loot only one thing before.
---
Yesterday i got disconected twice while wanting to clear a silo
---
Definitely want to retire somewhere with a gaming room. And it will have a fat pipe but not for the internet if you catch my drift
---
"Play it by yourself".
---
Sales point.
---
Oh man, that mothman power armor is incredibly disappointing. They couldve done something really cool with it, make you look like a mothman
---
Something else is going on. I looted three supply drops I did not request over the weekend and I did not get "wanted".
---
Hmm, I didn't know about that perk. Theoretically yes, you could use that perk and an Unyelding armor set to increase your speed even more and give you a bigger AP pool. However, you'd actually become dangerous to yourself at that point due to having to keep your health low.
---
I use the Healing Factor mutation to counteract the unreal amount of self-inflicted damage I get from fall damage from carelessly sprinting and leaping everywhere. If you're needing to keep your HP below 50% then I can see many occasions where your own speed could end up being the cause of your death fairly often, unless your suuuper careful to never jump or run off of anything too tall as even a 10foot drop could be legal if moving fast enough with low health
---
they are resource intensive farming to make the ammo to let you know.  lots of stable flux and ultracite.
---
How were you scammed? I'm genuinely curious.
---
It wasn't a complete failure.  Later on they took some bits of the FG42 and other bits of the MG42 (no relation) and made the M60.
---
Oh, wait, yes, it was a complete failure.
---
The only reason Fallout 4 still gets updates today is because of the CC and the updates only make changes to CC content. They stopped doing bug fixes for the base game long ago. 
---
There's mods devoted entirely to fixing the animation though.

They meant the queen part. The queen only appears when one nukes Fissure Prime. 
---
Treat others how you want to be treated man.
---
Well sorry ourside of dupers i can't stand them and i have no love for them.
---
Yep i cannot wait for their next project Cyberpunk i will take time off work for. Don't forget we also have the new doom game soon. 
---
My lord this year should be very good for us gamers.
---
No. I think we are all sick of this guy and someone already linked to his turdy youtube garbage. Blah blah balh, dev room, blah blah blah. Kiss off.
---
furious weapons are better.  Seen someone kill stuff faster with one of those.
---
Just enter fallout 76 and scam into youtube or browse this forum. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 2 months then you know exactly what I'm talking about... Don't play dumb with me please.
---
business 101.
---
CDKeys.com ^_^
---
Conan Exiles crashes a ton - could not walk by the guild base without a blue screen 
---
I wish they'd just hurry up and end the game and put it out of its misery
---
Treat others?
---
So,don't give an opinion about anything and you get along just fine.
---
Ok mate..
---
Not sure if I've seen a 1shot before, most ps4 players i meet are nice or stay to themselves...but i definitely noticed everyone and their dog has a tse weapon or 2
---
No. I play ps4, i have 350 hours in and have never seen this. Not even once. They are people just repeating things they saw in a video.  Im not saying it doesnt happen. Just not that often if ive never seen it 
---
I came across the ice cooler, it was very much appreciated :)
---
It's already ruined. They shit the bed and then decided to just sleep in it anyway.
---
Because crybabies...
---
Of course, I always use a mic IF available
---
No, I only asked because I am on PC and I would be more than happy to help you out. I happen to have wooden desk and metal stool plans. They are yours for free! My in game name is Tahoemandan.
---
oh crap really? I though they were all and only queens in blast zones. I usually hit the golf course to level up off the gouls using high ground and then nope out to the hotel when I hear the screeching. That was my first time trying to help take one down and I just assumed it  was a queen. 
---
O that must of came out wrong sorry lad. I mean thats my motto. I treat others how i want to be treated.
---
Besides dupers they really irk me for exploiting the game.
---
Isn't it left to the right of the door?
---
the bog is the flattest place in the game,  you'll either have to build near an ASAM battery or make an ugly, camp budget intensive,  scorch beast "umbrella" for your base. or build in/on water like i did [https://imgur.com/gallery/Ab1J6e8](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ab1J6e8)
---
We’re in the endgame, now.
---
Y’know, I was thinking yesterday about how cool the game would have been if it was in Fallout/Fallout 2/Van Buren style. The whole idea of the Scorched and the Scorchbeasts is pure Fallout to me, and they’re my favourite aspect of the game’s story. Imagine if you played as the Explorer, a Vault 76 resident who overslept and left the vault later than everyone else, just as its systems were automatically set to drain the vault of air and seal its door permanently, and you have to make a race against time to get what you can and make it out of the vault. If the mass die-off that happened in WV was put back just a few years, the worldspace could still be populated NPC characters (as well as fellow former vault 76 residents who you can team up with, who are all trying to find their way, survive and establish their foothold in a still-populated WV that has factions with different reactions and interests regarding them). The culmination of the story (in either a good or bad karma run, since regardless of your motivations the need to address the situation is still the same) would be discovering that all attempts to develop a serum that provided immunity against the scorch failed, at which point you’d have to find a way to access the nukes to close the fissures and kill the Scorchbeast Queen as the last major boss in the game, after which you get classic end-game narrative slides and boom, story’s all wrapped up. I’d have loved a game like that. You could even do an ‘apathetic’ run and end the game letting the scorch overrun WV and spread out across the west of the wasteland, and have the player suffer the fate of becoming a Scorched themselves.
---
"do keep in mind that time doesn’t freeze in the game meaning that years do pass"
---
Actually at least at the moment time has frozen. Check your time/date at your pip boy, log out, log in and check again.
---
After all the recent changes to the rates... No thank you, not more grind...
---
Especially since you can't deliver an item to your apt, without the help of anohter person...
---
Being able to eat the meat raw for hunger/how without getting disease is super useful, but cooked food is still hugely better. Lowered rads? Boost to melee damage? +2 or 3 to various special stats? Bonus dr/er?
---
No game never gets boring but it happened after a week of playing then till about a week ago all I did was grind queens for loot to help me fight queens it just got grindy like a bad MMO there's no motivation to play more I even completed all the practical challenges for me to do if there was at least a better PvP system that rewards you it would be a little better
---
Well minus the ability to keep every scrap of junk, ever soda can you possibly can.
---
They are different games but not "fundamentally". 
---
Literally sat in my office now discussing this very subject. How is it "FUNDAMENTALLY" different? 
---
Fallout's Game Loop ='s
---
1) Wake up in Vault, do initial quest
---
2) Find initial CAMP, finished initial quest and getting quest number 2
---
3) Ignore quests, go explore
---
4) Kill stuff
---
5) Found a base location (not locked to a certain place, like FO4)
---
6) Do a quest or 2 to breakup the base building and exploration
---
7) Return to step 3 &amp; repeat
---
That's the same loop as FO3 (minus base building) and FO4. The exact same loop. In the same order. That isn't FUNDAMENTALLY different mate, that's fundamentally the exact fucking same game. 
---
The only difference really is "quests are delivered via HOLO tapes" and "Every now and again you'll bump into a real person and have a real chat, using your real words". 
---
The game is the same. It's just online now. And it's fucking brilliant! 
---
Yeah I would recommend most players finish the story and getting geared enough for when Bethesda really comes out with content. Most games like this see players leave and come back to check out new content. Don't worry, the game isn't going anywhere. Come back when it's better
---
Yeah true, that would have been better..
---
It might be enough to have servers where any sort of item transfer (trading, looting paper bags dropped by others, etc.) between players is disabled, as duping, mule accounts, and other tricks all seem to rely on that. Of course, the lack of player economy is a major restriction, but it still remains a multiplayer experience.
---
My opinion: people are way more receptive when someone says "I didn't like it" or even "I hate it" than "It's bad" just because it is more personal.
---
It's a perk, it's been mentioned above as +20% speed in a party
---
Should have stayed true to your reddit nick.
---
Guess I'll just go switch to melee and just one-slap everyone since that's so much more skill when ranged weapons are severely disadvantaged against melee chars in PA.
---
Eh, It was ok at Harpers.  Someone nuked Watoga yesterday and that was complete flop.
---
100%. They need to put a spawn point mat. It was in fallout 4, why isn't in this game especially when people are building on the side of mountains, in trees, etc. Such a simple thing to overlook.
---
Also. Here, this should help you never buy the same plan again.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/acvptm/wip\_i\_made\_a\_visual\_catalog\_matching\_camp\_assets/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/acvptm/wip_i_made_a_visual_catalog_matching_camp_assets/)
---
Agreed!
---
Just imagine a synth that looks just as your own character running around in West Virginia
---
So, it's like the stone of jordan thing all over again from Diablo 2? I ask, because I've never really understood the point of this kind of thing. Is it an arms race thing, a greed thing, or a desire to fuck over everyone else's fun? Seriously, I've never gotten it. 
---
What's the difference between a server rollback and a disconnect?
---
I really don't understand where these posts come from... You really think people are just hating on the game for no reason?
---
Now you got me curious... I see a future target for my nuke.
---
&gt; or browse this forum.
---
You're thinking of r/Fallout, bud, this sub is mainly people playing the game. Kick rocks.
---
You wasted 600 hours of your life. Learn from this? 
---
There's no endgame, it supposed to be a long lasting game with continuous updates. This is Minecraft, not Bioshock.
---
It's not like they didn't warn you.
---
300+ hours here. Would stab people that want wipe, i dont have even half of all plans. I had never isue with dupers. Yeah ban them, but dont touch my shit!
---
No reason? No. 
---
Because they’re hipsters who worked out you could exploit the game for power armour and decided that was shit. 
---
I fail to see how this game is drastically different enough from FO4 to merit such a low review score. 
---
Same game loop. Same play style. Same game. Just online. It’s barely different. 
---
True, but what if a synth maybe a gen 1 or even a prototype were invented in the time span of fallout 76 and somehow got to West Virginia. Like it may seem impossible but Bethesda did that with the brotherhood of steel. Though you do have a very good point.
---
Yes, during the beta times there were people level 100 already ;)
---
you cray cray, Power Armor is amazing as soon as you have enough cores to keep it running.
---
So good. What’s the water output?
---
Yes, i'm level 153 and played moderately almost daily since beta, no exploiting, and i didn't looked to level on purpose, just played normally.
---
I like your thinking. But I'm no closer to realising Fallout 1 or 2 in co op after playing this. I don't feel like I've contributed to the fallout universe like I did with the other games, rather I've barely itched a scratch that should have been fallout 4.
---
The reputation system is sorely lacking these days, no more than this game. It was the perfect opportunity to implement it.
---
Oh no, that Med-X, a level 5 pipe pistol and 13 10mm rounds were so overpowered before!
---
i haven't been able to connect in the last couple weeks. 
---

I tried repairing the install but so far nothing has worked.
---
Well you obviously need to play more games cause I have never in my life seen such a bad launch. The game is worst   
---
spot now than it was 2 months ago. If todays patch doesn't fix things big time it's over.
---
Warn? I thought I was playing fallout?
---
A Lucky crit build let me play with a number of dif weapons, then I went ninja route.
---
At this point I'm convinced that the Flatwoods Monster just hates me because everyone else I know has found one already.
---
The game should allow you to keep trying codes without using more keycards.
---
Mind your own business.
---
Well before thet nerfed our exp at Whitesprings. It was king of leveling in nuke zones. The nerf does not hurt too much really but more decreases to exp. Plus glowing ones keep spawning after nuke zones end. Plus every time a new player entered Whitesprings all mobs respawned. Could use this by simply having someone leave server and join back in on ya.
---
So you could get a good 5 or more levels or so per nuke.
---
Yeah please go do that, I am sure you'll love the mid air jedi fights as well :D
---
You get a bounty if you try to shoot out your friends window too - found that out the other day by trying to shoot out of it and found that the "window" isn't actually a window and got a wanted status LOL

If you launch though the launcher logged in you don't need to enter a password

My husband and I spend most of our evenings together playing Fallout 76. Most of my camera roll is taken up with odd pictures of us in different locations. He has a great Wendigo picture of my character naked trying to play the piano. #wendigobugs4ever

What? 
---
People crying about needing boiled water instead of just using purified. Boiled water is everywhere. Why aren't you just picking it up for cooking? 
---
I'm not looking for a reception. I didn't blast their posts with personal jibes. I just gave an opinion. Got personally attacked for it. 
---
Hey man,
---
1st up, appreciate you taking time to help others.
---
2nd. Im currently away for a week. So im not going to see the atoms shop, but i have someone to log onto my account if needed. Do you do this for every time sensitive item? Do you list the time sensitive discounts? And do you post up the new items of the week?
---
I got to figure out how I can have a notification when you post. Either that or Ill just check your account posts each day.
---
I'll probably have moved on. It's a shame.
---
I was asking my 320lvl friend how much hours he have in, it was over 500 hours, so um, if you are nerd, everything is possible.
---
It literally says in the title that they have reported it to Bethesda, and then in the body explains that they would just like more exposure for said bug to get fixed.
---
PC MasterRace!!
---
"Cryptid Hunter" are you working for BoS?
---
They should not hold Bethesda accountable for there game... I mean it's not like Bethesda made us pay for it right.
---
This is the equivalent of the diner finishing his meal and then wanting a refund because it was inedible.
---
Xbox 4 deluxe
---
not true, I get 3 star drops from the 3 star legendary guys just fine with my simple non-single-shot-handmade.  Want some Assassin Roller Pins?  I got some of the best ones!
---
Yeah, then you hop to a server that has one of those events active, fast travel there and the event ends before you can start it. That can't be annoying at all on top of server hopping constantly. 
---
Lol no thanks 
---
I've killed two of the aliens and they drop crap. Hell, level 9 ghouls drop better stuff (meds).
---
I think based on the timeline, there might not be synths since the first two generations were introduced in Fallout 4 and the third and fourth in Fallout 3
---
Ah yeah I didn't play FO4 but were the Blue Screens, Server Disconnects, Invisible Team mates, and sucky events... also in FO4?
---
You possibly did, yes. 
---
I read a ton of these posts about duper’s and I usually just end up saying the same thing and being hated for it, I ask for proof. This is very common, and very unpopular. 
---
Rarely though do I see a post describing what actually appears to be players possibly duping, but this is what it would likely look like from what I’ve learned.
---
There are 5 things we do when we think we may have dupers on server and want to catch them, but it takes patience.
---
One flag is the server not responding message. We scan the map for questionable clusters if this happens given that this can be a result of the activities. 
---
Second flag is the mass crafting. This is at least one method I am aware of that is needed to do the exploit. 
---
The third way to know is either steal the bag the are dropping to check for insane loot or kill them and force check the junk pile size.
---
Fouth/fifth, you can do a long con if you feel suspicious. Request trade and screenshot the inventory if it is clearly too large. Also ask for help or donations to see if they drop items like a piñata. This is strong signs/evidence of unfair advantages.
---
Now in the case they have duped items it would mean either they were gifted the items (uncommon), found the items (far less common due to chance), or duped those items themselves.
---
Unfortunately, from all I’ve learned proving this is difficult next to impossible. While mass crafting is the biggest flag here and they could have been dupers it could simply be friends hanging out talking in discord while a guy crafts a newbie an entire load out. It could be strangers trading, could be a guy with his second mule account with a legit pile of saved offloaded junk for mass crafting. Ton of legit possibilities in there. 
---
So basically you are left to check their bag if you can be sly, interact while recording or screenshot suspected evidence. At that point if you have evidence, report the info to BGS and pat yourself on the back for good work. We used these methods and have reported more than a few suspected accounts but only 2 we know of are banned/suspended as of a few days ago.
---
Major props for not just posting a half assed story lacking at least one elements on top of not immediately running to /r and simply crying Duper!

👌🏿👍🏾🤘🏽

This is the equivalent of a dickhead comparing food to a video game.

Sounds like something a synth would say!

“Maybe today I will get lucky with that revolver ivory grip...”

My build is a Riflemen with Melee and Explosive as back ups. I don't have any explosive effect weapons and my only two shot is a 10mm in my stash. Very viable &amp; fun due to the mixed gameplay and variety. 
---
Main guns i use atm are Gauss, Lever-action, blackpowder rifle, auto grenade-launcher &amp; tons of MIRV, plasma and Nuka Grenades. Also a shishbab with extra flame jets for melee which i switch out in nuke zones for my Ghoul Slayers Super-sledge which does 30% more to ghouls and also swings 40% faster as a bonus. 
---
10 STR, 15 PER, 3 END, 6 CHA, 10 INT, 6 LUCK. 
---
Main combat perks are all rifleman perks maxed, demo expert maxed and Gladiator or Slugger maxed with expert and master perks on level 1. 
---
Other notable perks include tank killer, Grenadier, Bloody mess, Concentrated fire, Gunsmith, action boy, party boy &amp; Tormentor.
---
Also everyone should have Pharma farma, it's bloody OP. 
---
Only if they can SELL it to you as CC crap.
---
On PS4 Pro and XBox 1X it absolutely is the reality. It's either a server disconnect or the game crashes to blue screen. I don't know what platform you're playing on or what country's server but that's what's happening on consoles for most of us. I was probably being generous saying every hour. 
---
support just emailed " we dont have the tools to fix it"
---
i would guess the modding community could fix this in about twelve minutes
---
By people who have no argument and aren't worth talking to. If somebody can't deal with reality, it's them that need to go get help rather than drag the rest of us reality accepting people down  ;)
---
Correct. Though some thoughts may be that it could be a prototype, a time travelling synth or maybe a synth not from the institute, maybe pre-war...
---
I drop unwanted items inside ws trader area in the black trash cans in the hall way.

For sure, I mess about and enjoy the story, but there are plenty of ways to power level.
---
I enjoy the game too. Because I like to walk in the lands, build bases, survive.
---
But I get why some people doesn't.

Fallout isn't Minecraft. It's an RPG. Some people played fallout 4 (or previous) for different reasons. Maybe it was for the lore, for the interaction with the characters, the dialogues, for the feeling that your actions does shape the world around you or simply to give a  "role" to their character.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't do this. You're just another player on a big map. It's great if you want to play the "survivor" at the beginning but that's it. I wouldn't even call it a fallout game, it is what it is, a multiplayer survival spinoff. And that's really fine as long as you're looking for that.
---
The only things I don't like about the game are technical. I know that the game just came out. But wow... It's literally a Fallout 4 mod. Come on, they had 3 years to make that. The IA should be better than that. The bugs should be minor or rare. But hey... It's Bethesda. They gave us some of the best games in the world... But this... this is a tribute.
---
Im level 256? But ive been playing pretty daily for a least a few hours since beta. Its possible just takes time 
---
I was massively disappointed in harpers ferry. A handful of supermutants and that was about it. But honestly any nuke zone is depressing if no one else goes (aside from the queen) like others have said before. There needs to be more unique events for nuking different places. Otherwise it’s just shits n giggles. 
---
Definitely all duped 😔 don’t support this, come on people...
---
You think you have it bad - we're doing that "DMV" mission and one of us crashed. In a team, that means it resets you back to the beginning....
---
I was starting to think this myself, I'm LVL 63 and this was my first encounter lol.
---
I've still yet to see a super mutant behemoth or giant sloth in fo76 
---
The plans are at way too many vendors after a certain level. Man, finding a rad rifle from a drop is rare. I think I've found 10 in 127 levels and I usually sell them because they're always worth high caps.
---
Hey dickhead. If I don't like the first mouthful I'll spit it out. Fucking idiot.
---
There is nothing wrong with asking these kinds of questions because of how much misinformation has been spread before, so I don't get why people are lashing out at you.
---
Yes. I haven’t personally but I have a mate who is about 205 now and he loves to play 76 without glitches. 
---
I don't know how you can say it wasn't made for MMOs, there are many MMOs that have used the engine. There are obviously single-player games that use it, they just don't utilize the networking. Unless you're nitpicking that I was saying it's 'specifically' made for MMOs and insinuating that I was saying single-player games can't use it at all.
---
Well, based on some people's funny logic on this thread, you are still trying to store more stuff than you are "allowed"(as they call it), so should be flagged as moral bad and possibly killed on sight or get  your C.A.M.P. destroyed as those dupper if not worse.
---
I am starting thinking those self-appointed moral police are actively destorying this game for casual player than a real dupper ( or any other  real expliotor ) do.
---
Dupper might ruin some of the high end raid-type contents or make other people bored, but those people are doing worse by laying their hand with mid to low level players.
---
For the love of God, Bethesda, please implement a meaningful report system so that people can report those potential dupper and let Bethesda investigate them, and ban people who are actively harassing innocent player!
---
Didn't they just ban a whole megaton of people for using mods ?
---
You can report the account for investigation, that’s likely harmless if they aren’t guilty. Otherwise you may be helping do some good. 
---
There ARE a lot of client-side hiccups too, which are unrelated to connectivity. 
---
I think, however, that Bethesda’s servers aren’t really built to handle even minor hiccups. While other platforms can handle this almost seamlessly, a small communication error between the client and server in Fo76 causes the client to entirely desynchronize from the server, resulting in crashes or being booted to the main menu. At least, this is my theory. 
---
The ones you lock pick are for the nuke codes and you don't get a bounty from therm. The others are open to anyone to loot (there's a quest for it!) with unique loot for each player. I call bullshit on this. 
---
Especially blue one at Whitesprings, near stash box
---
I've seen things last at least 30-60 mins. Like I've dumped some stuff, went away to do a quest, come back and it's still there.
---
No actual numbers of how long it will stay though so take this with a grain of salt.
---
I played all weekend and haven’t experienced any of that. But in fairness I apparently bought it the day after a major patch fixed a lot of issues. 
---
So in fairness, you might have a point there. But it’s moot now. 
---
Strictly personal
---
I’ve had something similar happen to me. I rarely pvp, but for some reason I was chat banned for 3 days! I don’t message anyone in game or invite ransoms to parties. I thought it was complete bs and there was nothing I could do about it. Yet someone in game must’ve been butthurt enough to be such a douche. 
---
Just trying to sell enough chems so I can go back and get my grade 10. Then I can make better chems. 
---
What you are missing is that OP already reported the glitch to bethesda. So yeah... your beloved bug report has been made. read before you comment
---
Do u also have 2 Cheeseburger and a Medium Size Coke?
---
It's not enough just to say that. How can Bethesda fix something that isn't described, even slightly?  At least provide some information so we can tell if you are imagining things and so Bethesda has something to go on if this claim is legit. 
---
I think the hate is less with the game and more with the people going out of their way to break it and Bethesda's constant fuck ups since it was announced.
---
Can i be ur bounty hunter too?? Im lvl 160 atm
---
You can't steal from people only see what they have without them accepting trade invite 
---
i have no idea how the purifiers work. description says 60/hr for an industrial purifier, and i have 8, but i call bullshit cuz it just seems random. i'll explore for an hour, come back and each one will have a random amount of 1-5 (i know 5 is it's holding capacity ). if i could actually process 400 purified waters an hour i would never have to worry about caps. or not be able to buy stuff from vendors.
---
Once i needed 1 bublegum for daily challenge, i had 5minutes, met lowbie which have one, didnt trade with me, fucking selfish dick. Trade stealing was hoax. Thanks very much, now i have 10atoms less.
---
It used to be a rich roleplaying game before it became a shooter/base building game. And for Fallout 76 they stripped it down even more by removing all characters and story. You know all this already... It just blows my mind how some people seem to think none of this matters. They must have played the previous games for completely wrong reasons. Like playing Quake because "it's fun to walk around and pick up ammo".
---
There are other games that do what Fallout 76 does only a thousand times better. If you think FO76 is "fantastic" and "brilliant" then I wonder how you would rate those other games. I'm sorry but I can't take such a statement seriously. You must be exaggerating, or your standards in video gaming are incredibly low...
---
I am willing to bet that in 2-3 weeks you will have grown so bored with this game that you have stopped playing it completely. I doubt you will still consider it a fantastic game by then.
---
You spent enough time playing it to get to lvl 100 yet it's a shit game.....why spend so much time with it then? If it's such a hot pile?
---
Alao let's not forget how it's something new that was never tried before in the Fallout franchise (Fallout Online doesn't count): the first-ever online multiplayer Fallout. If they play their cards correctly, it can go from considered one of the worst Fallout games to considered one of the best.
---
More spawns too. I've been to odd nuke zones where there just wasn't shit for spawns. Someone nuked Poseidon this morning and I saw 4 or 5 glowing ones and a few high level scorched. I think they nuked it to troll another player as there was a base there. 
---
I feel like there is a 3 easy payments line coming up.
---
My #Fallout76 character build https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f195f56&amp;d=ss2s42sm2sn2se2pe0ew0ep0eu0ei2er2c72cr0i44s12ih2ir0id2a80s72a00l22lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
It sure is considering the updates will be free. This is the kind of game that's gonna get better as time goes on. Since you're a fellow PSVR user I'll use this analogy. It's basically like buying the VR headset when it first came out and didn't have any games, when no one supported it but Sony pushed it out anyway
---
It is called "no life", as in no life outside of this game.
---
Oh hey, it's that guy who's been posting one sentence responses in every thread since November.
---
Is that the only part of the whole marketing of this game that you paid attention to? Yes you can play it by yourself, as i do on occasion. But i know for a fact there's no way i'm getting the best out of this game if i only ever play solo. Find some people to play with, it's a multiplayer fallout ya dingus. It's a very well crafted world with a lot of great locations and i can actually explore it all with my friends and that's where i've had some of my best experiences with this game. 
---
You have to pick access cards ?? from those robots, then click both buttons within short period of time and lastly pick shit from box that is now opened inside of that building
---
I don't see the comparison, but I appreciate you digging to find where I'm coming from. That's a fucking cool thing to do.
---
Personally, I've been playing a lot more with friends, hunting legendaries, scorchbeasts and engaging in nuke blasts for flux, legendaries and xp, and using my resources to help lower level players with an extensive, maxed out budget camp across the street from Whitesprings Station (themed after Schrute Farms from the american version of The Office) and offering my services for free crafting and modding when I talk to visitors.  I knew Whitesprings Station was a hotspot, but I really had no idea.  There's almost always at least one person crafting, sleeping in the America, Night-time or Irrigation suites or playing music on either the lounge area piano or the upper balcony patio bass, snare and banjo area.  You'd be surprised at how appreciative most players are.  There's almost always a bag of random scrap, food, ammo and the odd handful of legendary stuff when I fast travel back home.  Some of it is pretty good.  I traveled back to make some food yesterday and there was a bag with a bunch of steel scrap, some .45 ammo, three cans of cajun rice and beans and a half dozen nuka cola right in front of my stash box.  Problem solved/zero effort.  Since I set up camp there, I haven't used my plants at all.  People leave cola, water and stable food all the time.  I almost feel guilty taking piles of one and two star legendary stuff during blasts because I have a convenient camp open to the public.  
---
It's incredibly rewarding to hear area chat participating in a whitesprings blast with people saying hey there's a house right up by the station that has two chem benches, not knowing that I'm there hunting legendaries with them.  I still have yet to hear any mention of the Schrute Farms references.  I'll be over the moon when I do.
---
Getting 2-3 friends together to mess around and collaborate with on a Fissure Prime blast is literally a blast.  Today I briefly fifth wheeled with a four man party that were clearly familiar with each other at a Fissure Prime blast.  One guy put his mic in front of a classic rock playlist, and I have to say that helping to take out a lvl 80 scorchbeast while listening to a Freebird guitar solo is pretty damn amazing.
---
Luck is a good bet, there’s cards like bloody mess for a damage buff and there’s a bunch of mutations that benefit melee which you need starched genes in order to keep them.
---
Agility is a good bet too for things like adrenaline. If you’re in PA most of the time endurance won’t help you much. 
---
Where  ?
---
Does this work with mod plans too? Or just the base weapon plan itself?
---
Am I missing the joke?
---
If there was only one and ammo you probably took something he was probably trying to transfer to another character.... Not gonna say what that makes you.
---
Snitches get stitches
---
That is where I have been dumping them when hanging around the golf club. I also pick up paper bags people dump and put them in there too. 
---
Boy, that knuckles model doesn't quite line up, does it.
---
It was on the ground with 3 other copies and 1700 black powder balls. I'm the bad guy tho got it. 
---
Yes a lot of people here are in denial and threads get downvoted quickly. But they are posted here too. Might wanna check your settings in case you haven't seen them.
---
Isn’t that Kinda Witch Hunting, I understand they were cheating, but cmon mate just file ur ticket and let it go
---
People do craft you know.  Ammo, repairing gear, making chems.  If they were near the overseers camp they likely were a mule or a new player getting help from a higher level.  I can't see dupers doing their thing near a free quick travel point where anyone could see them and kill them.
---
No! It doesn't, it's very annoying. Lol
---
I just did this today!
---
It does work but you're right, it is bugged.
---
What you have to do is when you get to the alpha/beta card objective, click on one pad, run to the other one and click on that and then run back to the first one and click on that. So A-B-A or B-A-B if you get me.
---
Then it comes up with an objective to press the master stop button or whatever that big red button in the room is.
---
When the PSVR first released it didn't have any good games, so much so that I thought Sony would discontinue the headset.
---
 The only good games were like EVE Valkyrie and RIGS and both of those were shuttered within 3 months. The only good game was RE4 and that wasn't worth buying a headset.
---
 But that didn't happen, companies like Bethesda backed the headset and now I actually recommend it to people because it's not a gimmick.
---
You need to use slow metabolism that makes you hungry less.
---
I tried sparring with you, you kept taking my workstation.. I realized I couldn't beat you so I came back trying to talk to you and you refused to talk and kept killing me 
---
^ right here
---
My wife and I did. Had a great time but haven’t played for about 6 weeks and now just waiting for Anthem instead.
---
I had both cards, but clicking both buttons did nothing,  Haven't tried since.
---
That sounds like an internet connectivity issue. 
---
Similarly leveled players would prevent me from playing with my brother. I got the game just after release and is lvl 125 and he got it after Christmas and he has small kids...
---
Three star gutsy isn't guaranteed, I've had a one star and a two star before with no three stars appearing.
---
You seem confused
---
That looks pretty damn good actually.
---
What system? Not the bad guy, definetly sounds duped to me. This is fallout after all, even if it wasn't duped it was fair game. 
---
As in the actual White Spring Resort. Head to the main entrance and enter through the doors. 
---
A player run gambling function would be great, with some type of game (maybe the slot machines from fo4), but also allow for cage matches &amp; betting. Player who owns the camp would get a cut/rake. 
---
Might have been me. I started doing it a while back, but so are lots of others. If I see a level 1 inside Vault 76 and I'm nearby I'll sometimes drop any spare plans in front of the Mr Handy, otherwise I use the station suitcases. Seems a shame to waste them.
---
Nice digs. That’s a lot of excess power. 
---
I'd really like this with all of the correct fallout 3, nv, 4, and 76 songs.
---
That looks so creepy XD 
---
When the Flatwoods Monster is really just a crippled alien in an alien wheelchair
---
Yeah... I mean, I did like the game ok when it launched and have had some fun times with it. But looking back at the games I've purchased the last two years or so, this is the buggiest, ugliest and messiest game of them all. 
---
Vermintide 2 (the game I played most of 2018) had a messy launch, but otoh that game is pretty and has extremely good moment-to-moment gameplay that make me come back to it again and again.
---
I mean the main thing is I don't like having to interact with other people. I play this series because I like single player games. I dont like that the main quest is progressed through reading and listening to holotapes.
---
Also, building in this game sucks compared to fallout 4. I like using mods and building whole towns, not a small little camp that gets destroyed and moved every time I log out.
---
I feel like this happened to me yesterday, not only did I get disconnected but when I logged back in it seemed like it didn't save the last few min of gameplay. 
---
keep up the awesome work, FUK YOU DUPERS
---
Not saying that, remember I didn't say what you are... But, you are gonna get one of two opinion on this sub.
---
One head on over to xbon LFG and make a post selling them for like 2k a piece.
---
Or
---
Two destroy those filthy ungodly dupped abominations and cast them into the void where they belong.
---
I love PSVR. Not a fan of Skyrim though. Astrobot is amazing. It just as fun setting it up for friends and family to play. It's no gimmick. It's the extra sense you've been waiting for in gaming.
---
That a workshop creates a PvP zone (yes, there is a large alert), other players can kill you without a warning when you help defending a friends workshop and you lose \~100caps per death.
---
Quick traveled to a friend who was defending his workshop, got two shot like 5 seconds after spawning (in X01 PA), respawned 4 or 5 times, got killed again and again and lost over 600 caps. I was not aware how workshop PvP works till this point, that someone can two shot you in X01 and that you lose that many caps.
---
Are u on rn
---
Props for the title but sorry, you're also a bad guy. 
---
You're not the dude that did the duping but you're trying to profiteer of their cheating. 
---
Not as bad as the duper but not that much better either.
---
Do the right thing. Dump it and move on. Report the duper if you remember their name too.
---
I'm not blind to the games short comings...
---
I'll give you a heads up on MY experience. Right now I can't play the game more than 20mn without getting a crash or a disconnect. So I basically don't play it.
---
Friday I played with my friend his character was invisible on my screen for most of our session.
---
I looted a TSE salvaged assaultron but I can't use it cause the freaking gun is bugged.
---
I've spent a good amount of time setting up a great lazer rifle but I can't use it cause laser durability is bugged.
---
I've spent a good amount of time setting a gamma gatlin... Only to discover gamma is crap.
---
For the life of me moving my CAMP never works.
---
I get huge frame drops on my PS4
---
The textures are really bad. Some of the animations are really bad.
---
The game launched with 200lb stash which honestly is laughable (mini nuke is 6lbs a piece LOL).
---
I could go on and on and on... Please note that I work in QA and have a huge tolerance for bugs but this game is just too much even for me.
---
Clarify what u mean by 5000 of everything?
---
It's the alien varient of power armor, now we just wait for the DLC that somehow let's us hijack one.
---
Yeah I finally got all mutations. Bird bones and goat legs perk or Armour pieces with reduc falling dmg would help.
---
Could be an interesting thing.
---
I think I need a few days for change Special points and get Perks but I will try it. 
---
Final step will be with unyielding and DMS Perk. 
---
Thank you a lot dude and I hope the Infos helps you too. Have a nice day and GG mate! 
---
The difficulty of this game is almost artificial, theres pretty much an easy way to do most things. Get help, level up a bit, go buy a better weapon etc.. It's not hard to make caps as you can sell pretty much anything you find. 
---
So this is why it baffles me that people cheat in the first place. You're making your own game boring by taking away any challenge, am i the only cunt roleplaying here lol? 
---
Tbh me and my friends haven't really been affected by all this crap, there are 8 of us that play together regularly, sometimes we're all on and create a couple of squads. To hell with everyone else, they all seem in their own little worlds most of the time and won't stop to give you the time of day. 
---
My wild theory is that 90% of people play this fallout like all the others, which isn't really what the game was aiming for us to do. 
---
I'm normally a PC gamer, my husband PS4, but when I heard about Fallout 76 coming out I purchased a PS4 and pre-order two games so my husband and I could play together. Fallout 76 is so much better in groups. The best time I've had on the game is when it's my husband, my brother-in law, my coworker and me playing as a team. 
---
I called a drop outside Flatwoods and someone else beat me to it. They got a bounty and my cache was empty. It’s from the new patch apparently but it could be another unintentional bug. 
---
I was going to mention something along these lines. The other scorchbeasts we face might just be Male drones. Or they might all be female, and infecting other species might be they only other way of creating offspring. 
---
Noticed this on PS4 last week, will start doing the same.
---
Uh huh. No one is in denial, we just don't all get butthurt over a video game. 
---
1. As an Entry into the Fallout Series? Probably not. 3, NV, or 4 would probably be a better intro.
---
2. Yes, it's coop, but it's semi-optional. You don't need to join teams to help people kill things and get rewarded for it. 
---
To add to this, you can lock pick and hack the bulkhead doors and completely bypass the reactor. No need to repair the pipes.
---
Thanks! I honestly forget it’s ever cake day until I get these responses haha
---
I highly recommend doing the silo with a team. At least with 2 people. Someone to revive you, in case you go down, or if you die outright, you just nip right back in, take the storage room shortcut, and you're right back to the end. Even if you get disconnected, you just have to do the id card bit again, then you're right back with the team.
---
Sound theory, and thanks!
---
We do. Im level 56 and he is 21 though so playing consists of me constantly saving his butt then him demanding i have better items for him next time we play haha. Thing is,right now we are geographically separated due to work and its so great being able to bond in the wasteland. We have a pact where we dont advance the main quest unless we are together so needless to say i am seriously behind in the main quest haha.
---
No
---
If you have any of the following it will take a long minute to get to 200+.
---
A wife/significant other, a grown-up job, kids/dependants, any meaningful real life activities (pastoring college kids for me)
---
So unless you live alone, are on disability, and are an introvert who only plays this game don't expect to break it that quick.
---
If that is you though I would love to talk to you about my friend Jesus... 😁
---
Oh that's unfortunate
---
Maybe some points in intelligence. Just enough for the highest level perk card for power armour related stuff like the one that allows you to over-repair or repair cheaper. Maybe the Batteries Included one too to save on fusion core weight.
---
I’ve still yet to see proof circulating this rumor of a trade theft bug, I’m guessing you were simply being harassed by dicks. Always a chance this could be real but after weeks of quiet after initial talk I’d say it appears very uncommon or just a fable. Either way I personally play it safe and never trade with any player I don’t know until I see confirmation of the rumor being false. 
---
So you casually played a game over the weekend and decided that almost everybody that played it since release is dead wrong about it. Good on you, buddy, keep it up!
---
Yes, we need event that brings people together, but not another nukes. We need event, that puts group up to test and through struggle. Event that isn't about being at right place, at the right time. Event where you just don't go with your level 35 character, do 1 damage and get rewarded. Event where you actually prepare and bring your A game. Event that is hard enough to reward not only via items but also with good teammates. Because when event is hard, you start to communicate each other and when you are communicating and beating the struggle, you see that these are not just some random player, but player who have come together as an team and beat the boss. Now you know that user with name PaulFince, isnt just some random name, he is the guy who lead team to victory and teach us how to beat the event.  Event that you don't farm, but event that you "Do", once a week. Event that actually has an meaningful prize pool, with unique items that can be earned only via that event. This is the event we want, not some nuke were everything is random and no one gives a sh#t about other players. 
---
Does he play ?
---
Whenever a player drops or trades items, their inventory should be saved or the changes logged immediately (before the paper bag spawns), such that any rollback would be to the new state with the items already lost. At least in theory, maybe the performance cost of frequent saving and synchronization is too high. But it is a fundamental problem if anything that causes a server crash or disconnect can be exploited for duping.
---
Before this post I couldn’t even find someone to verify that the suppressor existed in 76, so it really goes to show how rare these things are
---
Between this and the new loadwarping/serverwarping glitch I'm amazed servers are still up tbh.
---
Anytime mate! Hope to see you sprinting past me like The Flash someday hahah
---
Yeah, I got both the cards from the Mr Handy robots and clicked the keypads in the allotted time. All objectives showed completed but still nothing. Oh well, I guess I'll have to run it again.
---
Where was it £9? I paid over twice that!
---
Shit I am having a blast. Make sure you listen to all the holotapes and read the computers you can. Listening to some scientist document her inevitable death by starvation or a raider decide the shit life ahead of her is too much so she offs herself hits how bleak the situation is. My nephews and I have been having fun finding the "perfect" spot to build camps and running events. Every online game has disconnects, hell i've only had a handful and I have been playing since launch. If you enjoy it then enjoy it. It's an ambitious project, hopefully it will continue to get support. 
---
That's fair, I just wish I didn't feel forced to use it
---
Yea, I had to QUICKLY run back and forth to the A and B buttons a FEW times, then it finally gave me the option for the master switch. 
---
You have to do a quest at Garrahan Mining. 
---
Dude I'm dying 😂 I couldn't be more right look at the two bros that just responded, one for both of the options I called lol
---
My boyfriend sometimes sits next to me and watch me play. :) I think the last fallout he played was fallout 3 maybe, but I have an obsession with fallout so he knows the stories of the rest. It would be funny to play together I think. I’m really into details and I read every entry and listen to every holotape I think that’s why I almost always wandering alone, lol. I’m slow as fuuuck. 
---
so we nuked harpers ferry yesterday... while when its not nuked there are hell of mutants and burned enemies, we were absolutely disapointed.
---
NO RESPAWN of enemies and only few glowing. would not recommend to nuke it. NEXT TIME i will nuke the area next to flatwood. xD
---
Since you're almost religiously downvoting anyone who is even remotely critical of the game then you're obviously equally sensitive.
---
Ah, yeah that's annoying. I'll give it another go if it pops up. I'm lvl 67 so I think I killed everything too quickly? Who knows. Thanks for the tip!
---
Not fixed on pc, watched 3 queens go down in under a minute each the day after the update. I wasn’t in the guy’s inventory but I can do the math.
---
Guess it was just luck of the draw. It is something that they need to improve on for sure. I'm just so sick of Whitesprings. XD
---
I unsubbed from three YouTubers who I'd followed for a long time on account of their FO76 coverage. They were telling me what a buggy, empty, joyless mess it was, whereas I'd happily been playing since the Beta and having a blast. It seemed they were a little disconnected from reality and I soon started to suspect their motives.
---
How tf are they rolling back the server?
---
No Bullshit. I had a public quest to get the drop. I went to the box and the box was locked. A lowlevel came and opened the box and the loot disappeared. After that the quest was completed. 
---
Yeah, i've been nuking a new place every day just to see. I tried Top of the world the day before and it was roughly the same. 
---
Nice  man! I live for the long fights. I have to admit, i love throwing out the bait. Classics like "hey man, I'm glitching hard. I can't open my pipboy, can you kill me?" and "hey, want my bounty?" are fun, but my favorite is for getting junk. First you need to convince a lower level player to team up and take down a higher lvl. Have them swing so the higher lvl hits back for easy loot, but let him get killed, then take down the higher lvl and grab both bags.
---
He plays with all who believe, in Spirit 😎
---
One time it spawned on top of me. They arrive by lighting strikes which are purple.
---
Yeah honestly lets have this conversation again in two weeks.
---
I've played over 200 hours completely 100% solo and having an awesome time. 
---
Not OP but i got mine for £9 from CdKeys just after Christmas

Bad press. Especially with the collectors edition. Then you have the various bugs and glitches, some game breaking or outright crashes your system (console), micro transactions etc. The game imo isn’t worth 60 bucks. Should’ve been 40. Game also should’ve stayed in Beta longer. 
---
Despite all of that, the game isn’t broken or horrible as people put it out to be. If you enjoyed FO4 and wanted an online FO the game is for you. Like you said, it’s virtually FO4 online. The micro transactions arent as bad if you compared them to Rdr2 Online. And on top of that, Bethesda is actually trying their best to fix these issues. Meanwhile Rockstar, the company that made a billion in a week with RDR2 barely communicates with their community on the state of online.

I got my lever action rifle plans from the Grafton train station, but it's not there super often. Doesn't seem to have a level thing like the handmade, though. 
---
I got the handmade plans with an alt at Watoga station as well, at about level 16.
---
Gun fu.
---
Personally, I gather it till I need to server hop, then check for low level players.  If there are none, I hop servers till I find one, track down on foot and give it to them directly and usually throw in some stimpacks and purified water as well :)
---
Hey there, I think I remember you, the workshop at the bottom of the map? I'm sorry I didn't communicate with you I never heard your microphone. Did you have the right audio settings on? I know sometimes I leave team chat on and non teammates can't hear me.I'm sorry if it seemed like I was ignoring you. I just assumed you kept coming back to take to the workshop. 
---
I'm not voting anyone, princess, I don't down or upvote. 
---
If it was anything like the last duping method, they had about a month to wreak havoc.
---
Me too.
---
maybe someone could give some nice advice where (besides whitespring and watoga) the hardcorespots are.
---
best ever was nuking 3 times the queen in a row.
---
Nice baitclic title yo
---
Fuck your mom, bastard
---
I like The Quartering and I think he got unfairly lumped in with a lot of YouTubers who were riding the hate train to fame and fortune, but he did get rather salty at the pushback from this Subreddit.
---
Does not fix it for me, but thank you! As soon as I enter any power armor with BOS officer under armor, I get the glitch again.
---
Its a good thing for our console bros. They need to get the stability issues under control. Also what ever is causing these crashes to desktop.
---
Like a certain someone would say.
---
*its a good thing.
---
Yes. That's entirely correct. And that is precisely _why_ they shouldn't be there.
---
It's like you're saying that, if we actually lived in a world where 9-year-old kids could put on bodies that looked 20-years-old, no one should ever have sex because they might actually be engaging in child molestation.
---
Sorry, no. Your arguments just don't hold water. Go talk to the parents, not us. It's not our responsibility.
---
This is untrue, you cannot 1 shot people that are in pacifist mode/not engaged in PVP. I have posted video evidence of this lie before. 
---
I'll repost here -
---
https://youtu.be/aw4xomXVwpQ
---
Have you thought about nuking other areas aside from the usual suspects to see what kind of results you get? More abundant mats? Different higher level creatures with different loot drops?
---
Maybe it's just me but I get the sense that people have just stopped after a few and stuck with the best ones from that.
---
What about nuking the Mire, or other areas of the Cranberry Bog?
---
We also use the golf bags outside on the golf carts.
---
You're playing a fallout spin off side project that you were told would be vastly different from all the previous. 
---
Same here.
---
That is a total outrage ! Bethesda making private SPIRIT servers available, whilst us mortals are duped and griefed in public ... quick, to Youtube with that. 
---
Maybe they should just give us the option to make new characters on a wholly separate server system (kinda like seasonal characters in Diablo 3) once they actually solve the cheating and duping problems. 
---
Yeah, but in 2015 when it was announced that wasn't even conceptualized yet, he was the mascot of Playroom VR but no one had decided to put him in his own game and the prequel in the playroom doesn't really compare haha. Just saying it took a while for PSVR to get better, and a game like this will do the same
---
I've seen many people both irl and online tell me FO76 is bad and when I ask why I just get "because it is" instead of actual reasons
---
I know the game has issues but people do seem to hate on it because its popular to do so
---
you are not alone. i could play max 15mins and then crash to desktop.
---
The white knights of 76. They crave purity of character, not morally but game wise. All exploits tarnish the experience if the "game" and diminish it as a whole. Every one must adhere to this standard, hence the crusade against dupping.
---
From what we know so far the vaults are gonna be huge dungeon that are mainly rapid spawning enemies not robots and have unique quest but the legendary part we domt know 
---
Community events. We're suppose to be rebuilding America lets get to it. 2-3 month event where we have to donate  resources to the project of building up a town. While this is happening events to where we need to defend the new settlement from Ghouls/Supermutants/and if they wanted to add raiders that'd be cool too. Maybe dungeon crawl a Vault to get some machines needed for the town to run smoothly. New bosses/new nuke bosses, set up for the return of Human/Ghoul NPCS. By setting up the return it gives them time to figure out how they want to do that, while also giving the community one of the things they REALLY want. 
---
It's not the little wooden gazebo in the wooded area, it's the stone rotunda looking gazebo, right near the tennis courts. Cut through the courts from the bus/fast travel point.
---
Yep, that's the plave, I'm badfrog.
---
I was having fun at first, I knew you were better than me but I had to try and take back my workshop. After many failed attempts I gave up and wanted to to just come say "gg" and talk about your build. I had area chat on, and was using emotes, I took off my power armor.. You kept shooting. You even added me and my mule account to your friends list and then apparently removed me. 
---
Disconnected - you were logged out, but came back with all your items intact.
---
Rolled Back - you were disconnected, but came back with the stuff you had 10 minutes ago and that really bad-ass legendary you just got is now gone...forever.
---
A game system vrs a game is a vastly different thing though. 
---
That’s one thing I forgot when I posted the comment. But I’d still be okay for them to wipe it so long as we retain the ability to craft the ones we already learned.
---
The reviews came out before/on release, actually. Written by people who have played as many hours as I sank in over the weekend. 
---
So although your comment is sarcastic and "haha". 
---
It is technically wrong. 
---
You cannot kill pacifist players regardless of damage output.. 
---
However you can 1 shot the SBQ
---
https://youtu.be/tECYG5qTU0s
---
You're right. I should never have fallen for the IP similarities. 
---
It doesn't get destroyed when you log out...and the build radius is pretty big dude. Plenty of space to build a town :) 
---
I love the state of the game now anyone has anything better than you automatically blame dupes exploits or anything else. Like a 12 year old crying to teacher because someone else is a piece of gum. /s
---
The outlaw, not a direct dupper but willing to take advantage. Will frequently look through LFG for good deals and has no problems buying anything or using it. Most likely someone with a life outside of the "game"
---
Nothing interesting whatsoever, I now believe Todd forgot to add any endgame content to his multiplayer game.
---
And no, the "so cool a bomb straight fron NV" random encounter doesn't cut it.
---
I've been working on it one day at a time. If I do see anything neat I will post with photos.
---
Yeah I know it's a poor analogy but I see it as a similar story. Both were products that were rushed and almost aren't good enough to warrant a purchase. The PSVR subreddit used to get posts like this all the time lol
---
It's not that they don't want to fix the game by deleting all the duped weapons, they can't. They can't track them.
---
And imagine if they did reset the whole game, I mean, me personally would be fine with that. But the other 97,2%, unanimously uproarious rage induced riots, led by the moms of the 13yr olds players, who despite the age rating got it for Christmas. 
---
They simply can't do that. Again, it's not that they don't want to, they can't.
---
I’m level 160+. I’ve never seen a Flatwoods Monster, Fog Crawler or Behemoth. I’ve seen around 2 megasloths and 1 hermit crab. 
---
Mothman jumped me once. And, ironically, bugged. Just stood there, unkillable, staring. 
---
Level 3 Action Boy/Girl is helpful for a melee build, especially if you use V.A.T.S. That's in agility. 
---
One the right side of the screen when your on the main page, look for EDIT USER FLAIR. and then just pick one
---
You are definitely not alone. I feel the exact same way. 
---
I met some high level players one time, when I was around 40. I had no mutation or any good guns, but I didn't care. I gave them some materials to repair their stuff and to thank me, they gave me a ton of serums and even a TSE. I did use all the serums because I was curious about it. But I did remove them all because I wanted to get them myself. The only time I used the TSE was on the Queen, mostly just out of curiosity. Now it just sits in my stash box.
---
I don't see a point in playing the game if I can't get the "good loot" myself.
---
I would say u want to make sure u have 8 luck 3 for bloody mess 3 for class freak and 2 for starched genes
---
They are not my friend. Alas they are for like some minutes, but not longer
---
I drop them in Overseer boxes, train station suitcases, but I like to trade with other people but most times they get freaked out that it's a scam of some type.
---
Yeah this happens all the time! I am ~125 levels into this one character and any sort of pvp is awful because people who are low level (50-80) already have access to all of these super good ohko weapons.
---
The kicker about this aswell is what you mentionned up there. When we try to farm for our good weapons weve got those little twerps that come in and make too quick work of all of the mobs.
---
Very cool find. Maybe put a spoiler tag up for yourself who haven't seen it yet though? This guy is awfully Elaine and some folks like finding stuff in-game before they see it on Reddit
---
I wasn't referring to you specifically. Although in your previous message you did say "we" as if you were speaking for everyone here.
---
Look I get what you were saying and can relate to the perspective of someone trying to achieve. But the outrage spend on this loss of 10 cents or less worth of Atoms is hilarious.
---
Child, you must first be born again to access Spirit servers since you can only see them in Spirit. 😊
---
It's just an emoji on my phone 😁🤣😅😓😧😩🤢
---
I went through my friends list because a friend told me having a large amount of friends could be causing me to dissconnect more, so I cleaned out the ppl I didn't know that well. Again I apologize if I came across as hostile, I never heard any of your voice chat!
---
Increasing your Charisma with food/drink also helps. I got my Signs and Letters for 8500. 
---
That exploit never existed. It was a rumor
---
Drama queen coming through.
---
This is pretty dumb since you can get a supply drop as a random event. Unless the random event drop is not effected by this change.
---
Its their marketing department. Idk it it's EA sleeper agents or what but they have been screwing everything up and making bethesda as a whole look bad.
---
Well consider a game like Ark. 
---
Ark is hailed as this all in super mega survival game that's awesome. But really, when you boil Ark down, it's literally just cutting down trees and taming dinos. 
---
But since it was made by an unknown studio its awesome. I am willing to make the same bet about FO76.
---
Had we just got "Wasteland Online" built by "Indie team #5945947" then it would be getting an award some time this year. 
---
But because it's Bethesda, its suddenly a bad game? I don't think so. The game is fine. It's barely different from FO4, which I assume you thought was a good game? 
---
How is FO76, essentially the same game, rated faaaaar below it? It's because you all tried to exploit it, ripped into the Atomic shop and got angry over day 1 bugs. 
---
The game is fine. In fact, why don't you tell me why you believe the game is so vastly different to FO4 that its score requires something vastly below FO4? 
---
If they've played since the Beta, I would say yes. I've come across people who play more or less every waking hour. I've put in around 60 to 70 hours and am just about to get to Level 50, so 200 seems easy enough for a hard-core player.
---
I'm level 111, and I killed it for the first time last night while going for the survey spots challenge. It took the 'kill 5 human-like creatures' challenge off my list at the same time, nice!
---
It's not a thing. =/
---
&gt;I’ll probably get downvoted for this post but this sub is quick to grab the pitchforks
---
To be fair early on they are very effective and pretty easy to find. 
---
Nope still sounds like you're being punished because of bethesda's inability to balance a game and a few bad people that decided to mess with dupeing. I mean if you want to wipe go ahead and just drop everything you have on the ground go for it, will be great.
---
Those are actual issues and deserve hate
---
"fo76 is bad because it is" is just a dumb statement
---
I don't think they've been named here, so it ain't really witch-hunting, I understand where you're coming from tho
---
You will find on here, people enjoy the game.  Most people criticizing have never even purchased or played the game themselves.  I think it is a great gaming experience, and I know it's not supposed to be FO5. 
---
Thank you
---
I remember the same thing.
---
Workshops
---
The real question is "why does it have around the same damage as a minigun yet it has more recoil?"
---
People need to learn to let go of the unnecessary possessions weighing them down.
---
Or use hunter / hunted station
---
Holdon, so Bethesda is monetizing DEAD people now ?
---
[emoji-less browser]
---
Realator forgot to mention that prickett's fort gives 200-300 wood every time. Can be very useful to build a nice cabin on this area for practically free!.
---
Call them now and quote #Freelumber for 10% off yearly land rates.
---
I can now confirm that this also worked on my xbox, i went down to about 70% of my budget from 100% by scrapping the 2 floor pieces that my 4 despairing turrets at one point was placed on, really happy now :)
---
One difference i noticed was that when i scraped the floor the invisible turrets suddenly popped up under the stored tab, so i just scrapped them as well :)
---
Thank you so much :)
---
Thanks for the info
---
Listen to the Hunter/Hunted radio station, though you're probably going to run into the marsupial jumping match. 
---
Keep some of the screws and springs. Maybe also lead, just so you are prepared to repair your weapons
---
The ones with the glass walls?  Those are awesome! I want one of those.  Would demolish my current brick home quickly for that thing.
---
I do like the greenness of it
---
P'med you on details
---
I have like 180 hours in and I have a lvl105 and a lvl 45. I feel like I don’t play much. 
---
I know this is a better and safer option but I like to play by myself. Besides I don't need revival help as my character is beefy and stealthy as fudge.
---
Don't know why I did t think of that, good shout both.
---
Curb your greed so I can get what I want lol yeah right champ
---
Thank You
---
God I wish they didn't ruin that game.
---
This isn’t their first online game. And no back bone? Seriously how delusional are you? Do you need me to list all of their fuck ups of FO76? Because the list is long, and absolutely unacceptable. How fucking low is your bar? Lmfao. They absolutely disgraced their fan base with this game, and took 0 notes from EA’s backlash. 
---
I'm new to psvr, so have a backlog of good games to enjoy. I waited for vr because it needed more content. I won't wait for new content for fallout. It's not new. There will be other co op games. I won't revisit this.
---
I'm not new to fallout, and have played and finished every one of them. 
---
76 is rubbish and has damaged the brand in my eyes. I won't touch another fallout game, and I'm not the only one, as I've been reminded on this post.
---
The hismgame is not good news for the IP.
---
Honestly I'd pay atoms for ones in a few variations.
---
I'll make room for you.
---
Become a bounty hunter and kill Wanted players.
---
Interesting... I ironically have the clean spacesuit on I got yesterday from that rando vendor in Charleston. Maybe I'll try a different outfit. Relog did fix the issue for me as well, but it seemed to glich again eventually and would have go relog again.
---
Consider Psychopath and Four Leaf Clover in Luck if you are using VATS. You could always swap out Pharma Farma as needed or use Good Doggy in Endurance to help with healing.
---
Anti-Armor Ripper with the extended blade mod repaired to 200% is comparable to the Blade of Bastet (except against robots) and is extremely fun to use.  
---
I'd start with new vegas or 4 first. Honestly 76 could be amazing but right now not so much they need to fix a lot. 
---
That sucks.
---
I believe its the new way of duping that's causing it 
---
As others have said, caps are instanced, but there is a bug that sometimes causes the vendor to display 0 caps when it should have refreshed. Just sell them something and it will update. 
---
You can find help online. There's also free of charge numbers to call.
---
There's serum recipes for 13k a pop in the enclave bunker. 
---
.... I've said to much.
---
They are coming now, I need to run🤐 😨😬
---
(That's no fun😭😭😭)
---
Playing a better game. There's a whole slew of them coming out starting this month - RE2, Catherine Classic/Full Body, Ace Combat 7, Metro Exodus, Sekiro, ...
---
You can find a behemoth in the south of the savage divide in one of the lakes ( twin lakes or Solomon’s pond) it’s near there 
---
And the giant sloth can be found near kinda floating town in the west of the mire ! Tangara town I think it might be called 
---
Thank you everybody, for the insight on this, it was helpful.
---
You've already got your answer, (87.5%) but for future reference: the Awareness perk shows modified armor values.
---
First one was great, spend many many hours on it.
---
Who brings junk to a SBQ fight?
---
Are you telling me, you can force paper bag to actualy load loot in SBQ fight? HOW?
---
Always has been Tuesday the 15th for ps4... 
---
I'm sure it tells you in the top left when someone has took your loot.. could be mistaken though
---
Start off with Fallout 4. A lot of the game mechanics are the same, so you'll come to FO76 with a head-start. FO4 is a long game though. Might be fun to start with FO4 then play both in parallel.
---
I have heard of it as its method since its using two lads to do the trade and abuse the save setup from crashing. Shame people are so willing to sell out their fellow community to dupe.
---
All the players I "borrowed" from
---
posted this elsewhere and it seems to be a theme with this "semi-rare" creature.
---
Mythical Flatwoods Monster...I found him as other people have. Right at my level and when I engaged him he didn't run away like he does for some folks.
---
[https://imgur.com/g7OPssk](https://imgur.com/g7OPssk)
---
But seriously? This loot after i killed him? And this seems to be an ongoing thing. Everyone that reported killing the bastard has gotten crap loot...
---
[https://imgur.com/BaTpT2c](https://imgur.com/BaTpT2c)

Come on make it worth the excitement when you kill something cool and run to loot them.
---
I got better loot off an enraged Grafton Monster that was level 30....
---
I've been collecting the wedding ring up there!
---
You guys are dreaming about private servers.  The game was a financial abortion.  There isnt the money to continue supporting the game.
---
My fiancee and I play together a lot.  I got in on the Beta, and we bought her a nice laptop on Black Friday.  It's an awful lot of fun, even if I'm jealous that her machine runs the game smoother than mine haha
---
No one has came to kill me so far
---
Ikr :( other than dupers the community's actually pretty great. Its just a shame people are doing it 
---
I mean junk
---
To be fair when I crouch up and down in front of someone, I’ve dropped stuff on the ground for them as a gift (water, stimpaks, etc)
---
Any container you build in your camp is just a stash box with a different skin.
---
Or did I just get whooshed?
---
Hello fellow evil player. I enjoy waiting for all those hazmat suit wearing folks in whitespring to walk by a pack of cars and opening up with my explosive handmade. Make it rain loot bags!
---
That makes zero sense.
---
What are you, some annoying narration?
---
"In a world where there are white knights and outlaw, one boy stands between the two groups, sniping at each of them while being non-committal himself. He is The Fencesitter (rated PG-13)".
---
Like, firing teddy bears out of cannons?   At people across the map?  (Incoming!)
---
No damage but the recipient gains a teddy bear in inventory and shooter gains points in the game?
---
If you invest I agility/strength then Barbarian and evasive if y
---
Not your best bet is putting like 9 in endurance and taking iron clad/life giver also if you can afford the negative affects a couple mutations give you good bonuses 
---
I farm WV Lumber (it's about as far North West as you can go) a lot.  Usually has lots of loose screws sat on desks and there's always super mutants there who have caps that pay for the trip + give ammo.  It also has all of the workbenches and two power armour repair things, one of which often has a power armour frame on, and usually has 1-2 fusion cores too.
---
Not surprised. The 'real' flatwoods monster is thought to have been inspired by a comic released the month before featuring aliens that look like this. 
---
I can run an ARK server out of my house. It doesn't cost anything.
---
I am a patient evil doer. I wait for life to kill, then I take what I haven't rightfully earnt
---
Only way to game!!!! Well until that shit hot exclusive comes to a console, and we all bitch about it! lol
---
They probably ddos it somehow like they used to by spam crafting. They just found another method. The autosave-timer (from what I've heard here and there) is around 10 minutes. So every time they crash the server there's going to be a mini-rollback. 
---
Some games are long term projects, even WoW only started with like 10 dungeons and 2 raids. 
---
76 is definitely bad right now, but will get better. That's regardless of players leaving, new players will come in if the content is good enough. 
---
You have to remember this isn't Fallout 5, just like ESO wasn't Elder Scrolls 6. Story progression and NPCs will come back ha
---
Oct 2018 darn dupers..
---
Nov 2018 DAMN THOSE DUPERS!
---
Dec 2018 dupers.
---
Jan 2019 them dupers got us good.
---
Jan 2020 I reckon those dupers are still round these parts
---
Jan 2525 There be dupers in here.
---
Its comical to see anything flaws with this game tied to them dupers that got away with it because those meddling kids aren't around.
---
I've not seen one, to ever use. I had a plan in my head to start the game and use heavy weapons and power armour as I thought it'd be fun but its not\* so I've been looking for any sort of TSE weapon to make getting others a bit easier.
---
\- low damage to high repair and ammo costs....Or I could use a melee weapon to to more damage and costs WAY less to upkeep
---
Real money seller, avoid.
---
N e v e r 
---
I also went to revive someone one time but they died , so that's where it all began
---
I’m not seeing it that much. Maybe twice in a 4-6 hour session. PC.
---
There is no hate this entire subreddit is a circle jerk of people sucking each others cocks about how good this game is. “My wife and I finally made it to the top of the world HEHE GIMMEKARMA”
---
It's fake, always has been.
---
yes. I didn't play during the beta, but got the game a few days after release. no bugs, no glitches (though a LOT of nuke zone farming). am currently level 167. I could have been a lot higher if id done nothing but the nuke zones, but i like spacing it out with camp building etc.
---
I drop all my extra plans, recipes and ammo at the railway stations. I usually use the mailbox inside, but if it’s not there I use the suitcases. Im always happy to see other do the same and other play benefit from it!
---
Cool thanks gotten sick of using power armour all the time. Wanted to try a build that didn't need to incase itself in a metal Tim can so it cal walk from a to b
---
Also, just jump right after the "Super Hero" landing and it will cancel the animation.
---
I like 76 and don't really mind it being multiplayer but I still would like the next one to be solo again.
---
But I do agree it has a good chance of becoming one of the best Fallouts
---
Didn't you see he wants to be in PA so no he doesn't.  He needs PA cards on.
---
Some are legit.
---
RM duper-seller, reported.
---
Just between us, if you see a gaming news article along the lines of "New Bethesda outrage, private virtual servers for dead people" ... we had nothing to do with that, ok ?
---
Although its like an Ian M Banks novel ... 
---
It tells you someone has but not who that someone is.
---
Ok, so I wasn't the only one on PS4 then.  It's odd that I have 191 hours in the game, and last night was the first time I got completely booted out to the PS4 crash menu 3 times within 20 minutes.  Previously I've only had a couple of server disconnects within the first 190 hours.
---
You lookin for a sweet game of caravan?
---
Thanks for the information.
---
I find perhaps 1 vendor a every couple days that has caps, and that's with being disco'd 4-5 times a day.
---
Hey, thanks to you both for pointing out the Borderless Window piece.  I'll admit I read too quickly the first time through and missed that, and now that I've tried it the game is running better than it has in a long time.
---
Mr Prickett's Fort lumber purveyor, sir, sadly we only have a limited space to work with when it comes to the property listings. 
---
However, I assure you that our reputable world class agents will be sure to mention this fact during the property inspection.
---
Fine, I'd actually give up every legendary weapon that came from regular looting and not quests, and start over collecting new ones, if it meant the game were rid of all of the damage done by months of duping what were probably originally only a handful of weapons and are now probably ten thousand or more. Satisfied?
---
Not saying anyone else has to feel the same way, but that's the strength of _my_ convictions.
---
When's the last time the wind whispered *hostiles* to you?
---
I need this on steam so i can also 100%
---
Because the programming of fo76 is terrible and all those posts on launch talking about its vulnerabilities weren’t lies.
---
Like it or not, bethesda copy/pasted code and uses a decade old engine to save money and this is repercussions of that 
---
The new patch hasn't been pushed for PS4, or Xbox IIRC. Unless OP mentioned playing on PC, you're guilty of jumping to conclusions as well.
---
I'm sorry man. I love your enthusiasm, but I'll be long gone. And good riddance to me and my opinion, because I've bought everything this franchise has to offer and I'll not spend another cent on it if this is the shit they are offering up.
---
I find perhaps 1 vendor a every couple days that has caps, and that's with being disco'd 4-5 times a day.  But I'm camped and grinding at Whitespring -- perpetually encumbered, so walking cross country is a bit time consuming -- which limits the factions I have available.
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
It goes like this though.
---
In a would where man children are bickering over a game. One man on break trying to waste a mandatory hour break that OSHA forces him to take for no good reason at all, like really 30 minutes is good, just let him do his job instead if messing with grown men obsessed with a "game". In this world he is, the filthy casual (not yet rated)
---
I sent a support ticket, in the end they basically told me, it is my fault, and just send in feedback ticket instead. Where there are no categories for tech issues at all. No One  will read this in support feedback section and do anything about it, really disappointing 
---
Ya I did too after my first character so I created a new one!

Fallout 76 is more than a mod for 4 and it's fully understandable how long it took them to make jt. It's a major rework of the Creation engine as well as a map four times the size. I think 3 years is a pretty good timeframe for a major studio to do so much. I also disagree about the player on a map aspect. I'm one if the players that mostly play for story and lore and I love to experience the world post war and learn about all the changes. Fallout 76 still lets me do that as well if not better than 4 and other games as it's packed full of lore but the much closer timeframe to the war makes it much cooler to learn about.
---
Someone report his paypal and bank account pls thx :)
---
Hmm.. That would be neat.  Donating concrete/wood for structure, copper for wires, circuits for generators, fertilizers for gardens, ect.
---
Donation events to build up each section of the town.   Would be neat.   Make our own "Bog Town".
---
No wonder you never got a response to your ticket.
---
Lol...
---
I would secretary love it and hope it becomes a book then movie...
---
Or how about the real fake news story about "verified owners gave fo76 overwhelming positive reviews". Talk about desperation from this subreddit to upvote that to the #1 post only to find out it was 100% fake news. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9znzqe/apparently_verified_ownersplayers_of_the_game/
---
Even the author had to correct himself and state its fake news.
---
Nearly every shot was a critical shot to the face.
---
Does with all my junk will I was farming Monster Mash. Got disconnected and lost all my stuff. 
---
Happened three times. Fuck this shit. Bethesda needs to fix this and ban those responsible. Also we need some private servers, this game would be so much better with private servers.
---
Our time line and fallouts split at the end of ww2
---
I had hoped this would be the case, but am not sure.
---
I tried building south along the parking lot outside of Prickett's Fort when I was low-mid levels.  I kept getting attacked by hordes of L15-L25 Anglers and losing my camp or dying to their attacks.  I suppose there might be safer spots that the one I picked, but I was so close to the fort, I thought I'd be fairly safe cause of the robots.   I am amazed you found a spot that doesn't suffer attacks.
---
Then why don't you just play it in March instead of now? When did I say they suck? They release buggy games that are in a much less buggy state in six months, but I still enjoy them right away. 
---
worst part is, sometimes you get rolled back and loose all items quest progress
---
I will get and keep a power armour for mabey the queen unless I find that a hazmad suit is much better with selected perk cards.
---
It fits though. About a month before the flatwoods monster incident, there was a comic released with littlle green aliens in clear dome helmets. Its thought to be the origen of the flatwood monsters supposed appearance.
---
Hello from the other thread! o/ OP of said thread, I'd love to see the campers and doublewides and trailers and cabins too, our shacks just feel a little out of place sometimes
---
Yes they tell you, but don’t give you the option to immediately go to another server.  I am saying they should say your C.A.M.P. can’t be placed, do you wish to try another server? Yes or No. the current way you just click OK, and then have to bring up the map, hit lb, then leave world.  Wouldn’t just a one click at the notice be easier? That question is rhetorical btw.  
---
They seem to get out of control after a few letters.  So start with the A or W, then put the letters either side. Same with den. Start with the E
---
That's true but its currently serving as my silenced weapon since even with all the pistol perks it does more damage than my 10mm pistol with nearly the same legendary roll.
---
Yes, I nuked Harpers Ferry.    Someone mentioned nuking the palace and I think thats a grand idea and probably will try that.
---
I saw a nuked Watoga and it was pretty lame, the robots did not drop any of the materials needed for flux nor were they "mutated" so... Was just a normal Watoga with a storm.
---
I want to try nuking the mire where The Heart is as well and see if it changes it?   Since there is quite a bit of lore in the game about it and the vines.
---
Tagging for later reference!
---
Stash limit was 400 at launch, still not massive but much better than 200. 
---
Awesome 👍 thanks!
---
Said it before, and I'll say it again - fixing exploits without massive ban waves of exploiters ***WILL NOT WORK***. Bethesda has to be doing both. If they continue playing the catch-up game, where they patch one exploit, but don't ban exploiters, who just move to the next exploit, it'll be years before most egregious exploits are patched up. The Division devs made this exact same mistake too, and it killed their game.
---
I ran into this guy randomly, shot him once and he disappeared I was thoroughly confused...
---
If people launch the nuke right you can be out of the zone while fighting her but in a nuke zone like White springs I struggle in my rad suit the enemies kill me in like 4 hit have marsupial so I can stay away better tho
---
So might want to pick up a suit or use some rad shields
---
Cool thanks for the info 
---
Ah shit I thought it split before
---
I went there and literally stood in the middle there was no fountain and no prompt. Are we talking about the white stone structure next to the building you can't go in, which is on the edge of that large lawn with tall trees?
---
Maybe it turns off when a Nuke goes off?
---
Nah man Bethesda only sees stuff that gets to the front page of this subreddit. That is how they find out about their games, their stocks, their employee interviews, employees calling in sick, PTO, &amp; emergency building evacs. 
---
If that stuff doesn't reach the front page then the AAA BGS are oblivious to the subject matter.
---
This is one of the things that i will step in on they offically said a few times during streams and such that gui mods are fine.
---
It was you!
---
Trust me, if you enjoy it now, you would have enjoyed it at release. Sure, there are some fixes, but the base gameplay loop was the same and all the fixes have been pretty minor. I enjoyed the hell out of 76 at release, and think I got my moneys worth of enjoyment. It is not a perfect game, but it sure is Fallout, and that is all I was expecting. Arguably the exploiration here is better than ever, with really cool and varied places to visit and a "drawn" map that leads you to these attractions. 
---
5-6 in int to access all crafting perks
---
quite a bit in luck which is great support (moreso if you will get mutations)
---
Naw. Best place to drop items is in the cash register of a vendor. In whitesprings case, in crafters corner.   
---
Me and my husband. When it was announced multiplayer, I thought, if it's good, well get a second PS4 and TV for it. After a week, we were running the Wastelands together. 
---
Have had 4 other friends get into the game and it's always fun when we are able to play together. 
---
if you click on there name you can block them for the time on the server or for good then just fast travel away. maybe trying to give you something or just dicks, thankfully seems like there are way more nice ppl then dicks.
---
What makes you believe that? I see no evidence
---
Does gun runner affect sprinting speed (using AP)? Typically "running" means the default move speed
---
Thanks. Yes I made those 4 categories and labels in my current sheet so don’t mind. 
---
Yea I don’t think that’s what was going on in these cases. They followed me fo a very long distance. 
---
I just figured out how to lock a door.
---
Id recommend you start with 3. It’s still my favorite and introduces the core style, humor and world building for bethesda fallout games. Also has some of the best dlcs I’ve ever played Bethesda or otherwise. 
---
New Vegas is much more focused on branching stories(voice acting quality can suffer because there’s just so much) and being made by obsidian has a very different style from 3,4 and 76. (Basically an odd wanna be western, I’m not into it other people are) More of the same in dlcs. 
---
4 has more modern shooter feel with a HUGE focus on settlements. Weaker story than other games as well. Starts out throwing way too much power at you for basically free. (Go from slapping radroaches in the vault with a stick to full powerarmored deathclaw mulching monster in like 5 minutes if you just run to the objective.) 50% shite dlc 50% ok dlc. 
---
76 buggy but has the largest and arguably most dense world of any of the games. The story is decent but it’s in Holotapes, terminals and notes that you find rather than presented directly to you.24 players per server 4 to a team. Lots of cool things to see and fight. The camp system works well but is limited. Trade is basically the focus for endgame at the moment. The game as a whole is going to be getting updates to improve over time. 
---
How can we be sure that it is a dupe method and not just server instability? Wouldn’t the server rollbacks instead of regular disconnects prove it to be the latter?
---
Oh... my bad. I thought I was online. Sorry for bothering you.
---
That's quite an emotional response, do you think you might be acting slightly dramatic due to the group mentality? Surely if you've played so many games you'd know that no single patch is going to solve all the games issues? 
---
Hey that's what I'm here for! At least,  its what I'm trying to do by starting these discussion threads. 
---
Bummed that they didn't port Hot Pink from fo4 here. Realistically I only see it coming back through the store but it kinda sucks that they'll charge for reused assets.
---
Never thought of jetpack smoke as a cosmetic. That's wicked cool. 
---
When I was starting those supply drops were really helpful. So much so that I head to the tower over by Flatwoods and call for one every time I'm over there.  Guess I'll have to leave the request in the overseer's cache :( 
---
General consensus.  It has many valid reasons why it is considered a poor game.  You don't have to play it to have seen videos, screenshots and player feedback on 76. 
---
Deep down it's a great game but the bugs and performance is of a sub par product.   
---
I'm really against the spreading of these rumours. Nobody has any concrete evidence, it's just someone theorising then posting it on Reddit for karma, then youtubers get hold of it and it becomes "the truth". There is zero evidence that this (or the opposite) is true, the only tests I've seen actually disprove it.
---
That’s weird. The one I found had actual legs. This the first time for me seeing this type. That’s pretty cool that they made more than one model.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I still find that most vendors are down to single-digit caps when I try to sell to them, so I've no idea what's going on.
---
But!  I'm basically a rad-eater that hangs out at Whitespring in the hopes that it gets nuked (not while I'm logging in, however) and I can grind feral glowing chubbies.  I logged in a little while ago and found that Whitespring was again hot and glowing, and then got disco'd within about 4 minutes, and then server-hopped for 20 minutes trying to get back there, which then reminded me of The Caretaker's "[All You Are Going To Want To Do Is Get Back There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtfTwqBfxgo)" which is a great tune to be wandering around a glowing and screamingly inhospitable landscape. 
---
What if the guys with six trillion pre-duped fusion cores just log in? Wouldn't that crash the server? 
---
I bought one of each and drank them, I was disappointed there was no achievement for it.
---
I found a behemoth in the abandoned bog town when I was probably around level 50ish. I don’t know if they’re more likely to spawn down in the bog because it’s a higher level area, but it might be a better chance if you want to go looking 
---
Me and my friends have sunk over 100 hours into this game but to say it's fantastic is a stretch. It's buggy as hell, the "quests" and overall story is pretty awful as well. Despite that we still have fun with it and I happen to love the map design so I'm happy to go wandering all over it. It does a few things really well which is what keeps us playing but to put this down as "Fantastic"? No way - there much better and more polished games that earn that title and FO76 is not one of them.
---
Looks more like air guitar
---
Party time! Excellent!
---
OMG this has been happening to my husband and I this weekend. It is absolutely infuriating. We just assumed it was more bugs, but it is dupers? Bethesda better fix it now. This is ridiculous. And the people that are working this hard to cheat are also ridiculous. 
---
People used to use this to dupe things in Ark too. Usually just DDoS in some sort of way that they haven't protected against.
---
Game glitched on me one night and instead of spawning a typical mob of 7 or so Super Mutants, it spawned 7 Behemoths. Needless to say they chased me down beat the hell out of me.
---
Well I'll be the dude checking out his own butt. Thanks.
---
Emotional? You played what
---
That's what I initially thought.
---
I believe this was changed with the (current) PC patch and (soon) console patch. It will now reduce drain at night.
---
Is it happening on all servers or only the PC servers? The reason I ask is that the update hasn't hit console so why dupe the hard way when it is easy enough with two right now. Although, to be fair, people seem to be actively hunting dupers using the old method so maybe dupers are switching methods because of it? IDK, I'm on xbox and I rarely DC but this weekend was rough. I suspect because people getting their dupes on before the update.
---
I also think we need more god tier energies like queens. It sucks that the only only way to fight engaging enemies is to use nuke codes but it’s still early on. But I agree with you 100% 
---
Yeah, I always dump in registers, whitesprings crafting corner if possible.  Its something all the vendors have and everyobe should know to check by now. And it seems to be the most widely used. 
---
Is workshop combat common? I had two players come to my workshop yesterday, made no serious effort to actually take it over, then left.
---
*Technically* it makes food restore more, which is different.
---
I just wanted to find out if there was a reason why my level 55 charicter has not found any good legendary weapons and or armour yet.
---
I am new to Reddit going a month now so I have no idea what karma is or what it dose..... Appart from being a ***** some times 
---
Lol is that a falmer?
---
Actualy every time we are fighting SBQ, there are loads of those enemies around. Scorched megasloths, scorched honeybeasts, once i saw scorched mothman, tones scorched yao guai (free springs), scorched mirelurk queens, ......
---
No problem. To top it off, the room behind the level 3 lock also has a nuclear generator that spawns an extra core, and the top floor of the EMS building (where the legendary enemies spawn) often has another core lying around.
---
F
---
Not really explosive weapons are really bugged on the queen most of the time you're only doing 1 damage. 
---
It really is so disappointing isn’t it
---
Has anyone nuked top of the world area yet? I feel like that could have potential
---
Spoiler: all of the people you’re told to find are dead
---
I live near the Pleasant Valley train station, I drop plans in the blue suitcase there.  I'll occasionally put supplies in the Morgantown station too for newbies :)
---
How so?  That doesn’t make sense to me.  Private servers wouldn’t stop them from making money on the atom shop - they would all still be hosted by Bethesda - they would just have access control limited to the creator.
---
I know man when i heard of the flatwoods monster it was pretty creepy seeing its name tag but no monster. I was thinking about something gruesome and disturbing but nah... just an alien
---
yes there is a "drinking fountain " in that gazebo not a "fountain" you know like the kind you press the button to get water from its in there trust me
---
I can't believe you assumed it's gender because it has Queen in the name. I just can't.
---
Game is completely unplayable now.
---
That would be horrible and hilarious :  A level 5 runs across a level 45 handmade TSE, builds his whole character around it.  Finally gets to level 45 equips it and realizes it's cursed! Haha
---
One ring to rule them all, never works out.
---
Level 95 / 210hours ..Yesterday :  scrapped vegetable starch equals adhesive *facepalm*
---
right in front of the clubhouse with the ghoulies gazebo just to make sure we talking same thing
---
Since it's on topic, I just wanna make people aware that the Herd Mentality mutation breaks perk card sharing where you have exactly enough Charisma (eg 3). It seems to somehow adjust your special stats -1 then +1, which reduces you below the amount needed to share, thus unsharing the perk.
---
Level 73 and encountered my first honey beast this morning. Only saw the mothman once and only encountered the flatwoods monster once. I suppose it fits in with the lore behind them, being so elusive irl lmao 
---
Mothman &amp; Flatwoods Monster are meant to be rare/unusual encounters, so I kinda understand the scarcity of that one.
---
Honeybeasts seem to pop up at a few places across the southern end of The Divide, and I've seen a few sloths (&amp; hermit crabs) in the Mire.
---
Gause Rifle definitely. 
---
Handmade does not do as much as Gause Rifle in a single shot but DPS wise? Sure.   Handmades fire fast, even semi auto.  Ensure you make the right barrel on it though.    Long barrels add more recoil but go much larger range.
---
yeah I ran into one because I saw super mutants with a purple glow and was like wtf is that and walked over to see
---
I saw a datamined thread a while ago and saw a pink pip-boy paint. I have yet to see it in the shop though. :(
---
I actually don't mind this as much because it gives me a sense of wonder or exploration every time I run into something new. I played Fallout 3-4 so it is always noteworthy to me when I run into something new.
---
I remember the first time I ran into a hermit crab. I thought I was crazy when I thought a bus was moving. I wasn't crazy.
---
I agree... bring back the welcome mat.
---
Plus it always seems to take about a minute for my camp to show up, so I spin around looking for it, then see turrets floating in mid air... then BAM my stupid shed shows up.
---
If the game had different factions, there could be key areas on the map which have to be captured (and then defended). As long as a faction controls one of these areas, all players associated with that faction would get a boost (exp earned, food/water efficiency, access to "super weapons", ... depending on the area) - so there would always be an incentive to capture and hold these areas. It would also encourage people to coordinate their actions in order to not end up being spread out too thinly.
---
In addition, a companion App could let players take part in these battles even if they're offline, e.g. by managing supply drops.
---
I've had a similar situation. On PS4 I am able to just set my status to "offline" and it seems to work well. Hope you find a solution soon! 
---
what system u on i will join your game and take you there lol
---
I think it's less about seeing more of specific creatures and more of a spread.
---
How many opossums have you killed? Chickens? Frogs? The larger frogs? Surely you've been to Grafton and Charlston enough times to run into the Grafton monster and Snallygasters a lot.
---
Hardly exciting to be fair but there's a ton of their work out there.
---
Also for what it's worth, I've never seen the Flatwood's monster. For the longest time I thought people were just saying the wrong area and meant the Grafton monster.
---
One time when I logged in and spawned at my CAMP at Whitesprings I saw a bunch of glowing mole miners but they were all glowing purple and staring at me. I crouched and watched them for a moment. Then the Flatwoods Monster warped in and they all started attacking! I'm not sure if that was just due to server lag and/or a glitch, but it was quite a unique experience. Had one or two more run ins with it after that, but never in that same way.
---
END GAME???? you know battered clipboards respawn, there is no end... if you are bored give yourself some mutations, marsupial is game changing 
---
Probably only doing it to see if you are a duper, it's like a witch hunt atm..
---
The upvoters aren't the fanboys the upvoters probably hate the fanboys. This game is a perfect storm for toxicity between resellers, haters, and trolls each with their own motivations to use the games exploits and ruin your play experience. It's why of all the bullshit ideas 76 had being public online only was the absolute worst. You can in theory patch bugs, you can add content, you can balance meta's but you can't patch people.
---
🎵Underground overground wombling free🎵
---
This comment just hit me with a wave of nostalgia😁
---
How does in-game voice work, can anyone hear me or just my team?
---
Pro tip: there’s a Halloween store up near the northern part of the map, alongside the main road that has a clown suit spawn. It’s near the vault by the edge of the mire (can’t remember which one that one is). The quest popped up for me as I got to the location, so I assumed that was where it triggered. 
---
Yeah it's right after WW2 because we use microchips not Vacuum Tubes in our modern technology. Microchips got invented in the 1950s.
---
they really should have done a early beta where it was temp then on release have kept the beta for a 3 month crash course to slow the "released game" concept I mean I play mmo's all the time and know first year of any mmo is basically a beta but most people who are coming from single player just don't understand how complex the mechanics of a online versus offline game are 
---
The game suffered from bugs and cheats this is true, but that’s not the only problem with it. I’m glad you enjoy it, that’s cool. But a lot of reviews rightly pointed out that the game suffers from some really badly thought out mechanics, and they showed that Bethesda didn’t really put effort into how the game was going to be played, let alone making it stable. It’s like the quests were designed for a single player, because of all the reading and the tapes,  but it’s sold as a multiplayer. I mean that’s just one example. I’m not gonna bother going through the whole lot, there’s plenty of other lists.
---
At least some people don’t mind this, but we certainly shouldn’t just ignore the concerns of a lot of fans, of which I’m one of them. I feel like F76 is a wasted opportunity.
---
I have way more positive experiences with people in this game. 
---
My point exactly. I thought they are used automatically when a crit bar is filled.
---
I got a prime double barrel shotgun receiver plan from 1 yesterday sometimes they can drop decent loot
---
I'll have to check this out and contribute as well
---
Yeah there’s a lot more to explore than I was expecting 
---
Isn't paying $60 for the game enough? 
---
not to mention all the non game related things like the bag and the rum and the helmet and the preorder issues that people blame the game for 
---
seriously why would people buy rum from a video game company?
---
The 200lb stash limit was a joke. Game was barely playable.
---
Since when? Me and a friend have killed dozens of queens just the two of us with explosive 50cals
---
Recently (last night) came across my 1st hermit crab. They are so cool hiding in bus looking things, want one as a pet near my camp
---
I should have put perk points in another other gun type than heavy weapons (does keep my junk amounts down so i guess thats a positive)  
---
Under armour breaking PA stats
---
Keeping stuff that people dupped seems wrong to me.
---
It's like, you think dupping is wrong, those people should be banned. But hey, if you can get a TSE weapon out of it, that parts ok. 
---
Ahh...
---
Very nice tip, thanks :)
---
Will test this out tonight..
---
Now i understand why the where so cheap, only 9500 caps, lol
---
1. Billing / Purchase / Code
---
2. I need help with the Atomic Shop
---
3. I want a refund
---
That is what I picked at the ticket.
---
Ok thats cool.. But its still not worth precious perk points:)
---
It's like, you think dupping is wrong, those people should be banned. But hey, if you can get a TSE weapon out of it, that parts ok.
---
Not saying every bullet does it. it's kind of like the same bug with the scorch beasts and you shoot it and it doesn't do any damage. 
---
What are your thoughts on Psychopath? 4LC seems better in every way. Though Psychopath is at least a available earlier on.
---
Did you fight the queen? I usually see around 2 or 3 sloths, hermit crab and fog crawler a few times. Behemoth i know there's a lagoon with 100% spawn
---
Honestly because me and my gf are so competitive it always boils down to who's the better killer and who can tank events better. But over all it's been fun playing together. 
---
I would just join another server and report them
---
I tried that once a while ago.  Your friend can still join your game and can fast travel to you but they cannot see you on the map.  Fast travel via social menu still works though but they have to visually find you when they do fast travel to you.
---
That is a bad ass picture. I was always fond of some of the npc animations. If we could get a kick like Kellogg uses in his mental world, that would be cool. We could finally do all the kung fu stuff!
---
Nice build! I like how it's all jammed in underneath with the main level left pretty clean.
---
That couch is part of the 'modern couches' plan. Think I got mine from workshop events but I'm sure I've seen it on regular vendors too.
---
Is it the lobster trap head? Looks like a mailbox? Ah I want that so much. 
---
Actually I can blame you. You made a choice to profit off of an exploit. Doesn't matter if someone else did it. You still decided that was ok enough to keep. 
---
I have fought 1 before but never seen it teleport
---
Take out pharma farma, as a sneak you'll rarely take damage and stimpacks are in an abundance in the wasteland. You can then invest in more vats buffs.
---
If you want marathoner* not that necessary, maybe only 1*, but you'd be better with atleast 1 point in adrenaline. Maybe take 1 or 2 points out of gun Fu and into evasive (if you're going to be without pa, and you're agility maxed. It will greatly improve your dmg resistance)
---
And sun kissed. radaways are very common. Either use ironclad for extra dmg resistance or something more useful to your playstyle
---
Why not just nuke it and find out?
---
Look around whitespring, in the areas to the east of the golf club i've seen them twice. The places where most peopke don't go to.
---
I’m not counting queen spawns in this to be fair. Scorched variants. 
---
Yes it is
---
I have reported a few and dumped the shit I can get but the crashes happen so fast and end up Rolling back some progress we where Working on 
---
Yesterday I dumped 400k shotgun shells
---
2k pure stable v flux 
---
200k Halloween candy 
---
.like what is the point 
---
Apparently the flatwoods monster has the ability to hypnotise mobs.
---
Drop nukes on there bases
---
dont be a fucking maroon. You dont like the fucking system or mechanics dont fucking use them. NOT ESSENTIAL. 
---
Quit teasing me... I been trying to get Marupial forever.... and ever....
---
I dont want to give up 4k out of my 8k of caps!  I just *know* my next mutation will be it!... 1 month passes.
---
Wow you're a toxic piece of fanboy shit. Lololol
---
Start with fallout 3 then new Vegas. True fallout gems! NV is still my favourite by far. Bethesda fucked up big time falling out with obsidian! Just not the same..
---
Maybe it's always been an unstable POS from the beginning? 
---
try repair all from the C.A.M.P.
---
This is why I don't trade.  Ever.
---
If somebody wants to trade with me, I'm assuming they just want / need something, so I drop a few stimpacks and leave the area - regardless of the level.  They'll either take it as an insult (higher level), or they will be grateful (lower level).  Either way, they are out of my hair.
---
(BOS quest line spoiler) Well. there were several monents when i felt like a complete idiot, like accidentally selling my main weapon. &gt;!But the worst thing was when I finished my BOS questline and got an ultarcite power armor. It was 2 AM, I was tired and when i saw another PA chassis in my inventory i thought "Hell, I accidentally picked up some shitty PA." And I threw it away. If I had read about the quest reward, I wouldn't be so stupid. But then, I don't like too many spolers. !&lt;
---
Until it gets patched and people get banned it’s not going to help much they can just to it again but it probably pisses them off
---
I'll get you next time *shakes fist*
---
Yes.  I'm really curious about the palace though. There are *tons* of plants there and the meditation quest spawns so many of the supermutants.. I could not kill them all.
---
So will the meditation event still work during nuke storm? Hmm.
---
I think originally they were always meant to be this way, but they had so many loose ends that it was 'just fine' to have all these things dropping like crazy at the start of the opening of the vault. 
---
But lore wise-- as time goes on these things *would* be rarer and people *would* be fighting over them... So im fine with the changes ,but an update to the system really needs to be addressed client-wide, so everyone understands that. 
---
Incorrect I have been one shotted, my friend was one shotted we double checked we were in pacifist. We then got one shotted by the guy again.It was very frustrating. I have also killed players while they were in pacifist using furious high speed guns, furious melee works even better. 
---
All it takes for the oneshot is to properly shoot the ground under the feet your video does not show that. 
---
It has been noted and documented also. You still take damage in pacifist. 
---
The new dupe method was posted in a few discord’s last night. So I suspect a video will come out and then problems will really start to arise. 
---
I am suffering FPS wise as well, albeit with a RX Vega 64. Tried most things such as forcing full screen etc. to no avail. Not sure if it is 1440p that’s the issue, but am getting sub 30 FPS :/ 
---
My laptop runs ultra settings at 1080p with a 1080 Max-Q at 60+ frames, and my regular pc should at least match that... :/
---
So I used to do the same. I would run and hide. Hell, initially I thought I could be friends with the scorched beasts. Then one day I travelled home. There flapping above my home was a scorched beast. He was attacking my C.A.M.P. He killed my garden, he destroyed my water purifiers, and worst of all he killed my cow. 
---
That was it, I had all I could stands, and I couldn't stands no more. I screamed to the beast, "We could have been friends. But no! You not only violated our peace agreement, you dumped a pile of guano right on top of it." I pulled out my.power armor and my mighty sledge hammer, and I attacked.
---
It was a long battle, that bastard refused to land for the longest time. But I held my ground. And finally, he landed. That was his mistake. I smashed him and smashed him. I took stims to sooth my aches and pains. Finally, after a grueling battle he screeched no more. 
---
Sure I got nothing much for loot out of it. I was down a bunch of stim packs. But I did have the satisfaction of knowing that I brought down a cow killing son of a bitch scorched beast. I spat on him and tea bagged him good and proper. 
---
So now I travel out into the wasteland with my head held high and when I hear the screech of a scorched beast, I pull out my power armor and my sledge hammer and I tell that bastard to run else they will feel my wrath, for I fight for my shit machine of a cow!
---
Oh yeah, if you put on one of the luck perks, your weapon will heal itself occassionally when fighting.

(Shakes in fear knowing that I won't be able to put up a fight and that I'm all talk)

The first fog crawler for me was at Welch station, the punk was behind me when I spawned in.

Absolutely this. Mods can get away with very minimal testing, as if they break, they can be removed. If Beth breaks something, we dont have that option.

---
&gt;seriously why would people buy rum from a video game company?
---
Some people pay hundreds for merchandising over a game that has not even been released.
---
Anyways, even if there're people who pay for that stuff, it should be good stuff. Hell, the rum was supossed to be glass and it's plastic or something like that.

I would LOVE to get my wife into it. She's not a big gamer, the most I've been able to do is get her to play Rayman with me, and she tried and enjoyed AstroBot. I'm hoping the latter will show her how much fun it is and maybe she will cave one day lol. For now I'm content that she supports my passion for me, as the Fallout/gaming merchandise she has bought for me shows she at least slightly cares lol
---
This happened to me as well. And they all spawned on the roof I was on.

That’s probably the real purpose of him, a weapon test subject

The best place to find screws would probably be any kind of business place that has desks and cabinets. You can find fans and typewriters there, both of which give screws. Places that have lots of toys are good too, because you can find toy cars and trucks, which also give screws

I just have a disdain for cheaters. That applies to sports in the real world as well as games and video games.

This game made me unsubscribed from my favorite youtuber: Angry Joe. Very dissapointed how youtubers exagerate everything for views and try to push their agenda. When i saw angry joe's review he literally showed nothing but the same 3-4 bugs on loop. Like game was nothing more then a few bugs that got patched away the next day. And then he started shitting on survivals and multiplayers because he personally only likes story driven singleplayer games. Evering else is trash in his book. Really made me see his true self now i can't trust any of his reviews since he only rates games based on how good the story is and how non-glitchy they are at start.
---
No I called a drop and opened it while a low level was there and I watched him empty the crate, he never became wanted so it must stay unlocked 
---
Problem is they are onto that and now moved into the green zone. So if you liberated goods from them already make use and pop 300 expo bobbles and shoot the ground under them while jumping.

Lol. It should work with the life-saving perk.. and use up beers in inventory if you go down.
---
Agreed. It's human nature to find easy solutions to things. But tax loopholes are legal. Duping is blatantly against the rules and punishable.
---
It's pretty obvious from the replies I've gotten this is another hoax
---
Oh exactly Im not trying to solve the issue I just want to make it really inconvenient for them I reported the 2 yesterday with hopefully sufficient proof we will see 
---
Great idea

One of the hallmark features of an EOS/FO game is experiencing a "lived in" world. Yes this is a "FO 76 has no NPCs" compliant, but the compliant is justified. Since Morrowind, part of the magic was seeing how these NPCs interacted with you and the environment. For me, the highlight was exploring an environment, getting lost for half an hour and then stumbling upon a settlement of NPCs and seeing how they lived life based on what their surroundings provided them. There was a thrill to "Oh I get why this town is set up this way and why the people are acting this way." That was the experience. 
---
Yes, Bethesda said upfront "this takes place right after the first bomb so there won't be anybody in the world." In my opinion this is what many people are calling "lazy". I truly believe Bethesda couldn't figure out how to have NPCs in the traditional Bethesda way, and take it online. Think about it, you can kill/disrupt nearly any NPC in a EOS/FO game. That would have broken the online experience. 
---
Having this game take place after the first bb seems all to convienent.  
---
I've got a 3 star deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw mod, 30% extra damage, 40% swing speed and does more damage the lower your health. That synth piece of shit doesn't stand a chance
---
Meh, nothing new. Seen it done already. TBH, the dropped legs aren't great. 
---
Reaching doesn't make it more interesting/ less lore breaking. 
---
Oh. Well there's a fog crawler that spawns near Abbies bunker, hard to see in that area though. Sloths and hermit crabs are pretty rare, only seen one in the wild, also around that area.
---
Youre right! I didnt see that i still have Pharma Farma. I maxed better criticals and took rank one four leaf clover because i dont need so much crits. I also have the healing mutation (and herbivor) so i dont need the benefit from good doggy.
---
Thank you with your help!
---
Im at work so im going to have to make this quick But there is a simple fix for this if bethesda has their servers managed properly with asset saves and crash reports. Might piss a few non dupers off for a week or so but will be worth it when the dupers can no longer dupe. When a crash is detected on any given server. Have all the players recorded to be in the server locked out from getting into a new server for 10 minutes, Thus not being able to retreive their items. Disconnect due to attemted duping should end by the end of the first or second week. And if the servers recognize the same names repeatidly being in these servers. Have them banned.
---
Every other fucking game with dropboxes in a game with other factions has you compete to get to them first. Don't tell me that this is something new you havent experienced before because that's a load of horseshit. You just want easy loot. GTFO here.

As long as the queen is still alive you re spawn in seconds, almost on top of you bag, not very hard to see who is closest to you bag, or where your bag was...

Taking down the queen i a sort of team effort and i have never experienced this, but i have found players guarding my bag, and that is 100% more ok than what you are doing...
---
Duping is a problem and one of the reasons for the disconnects. But once again an angry fanboy flat out refuses to acknowledge the servers are crap and crash ALL the time
---
Not just from dupers But from playing the actual game, the exact same way fallout 4, Skyrim, fallout 3 used to crash. Randomly out the blue. So they need to reset. Nothing new for a Bethesda game and I expect the same for anything Bethesda make, including servers
---
I’m sure Bethesda set themselves up for this nonsense when they decided to make something called “Break-it early test application”  which actively encouraged/challenged players to find these issues. Then after it ends, they fix barely anything, leaving the issues and exploits and plenty.  They’ve bred a culture of carelessness around this game. 
---
How do I know this? Because since launch I’ve had more crashes than I’ve had blowjobs. It crashes frequently and randomly because of the fossilised engine. Maybe it’s time we accept this shit will take 2 years to fix. 
---
Dupers gonna dupe, servers gonna server, haters gonna hate, potatoes gonna potate 
---
This TOTALLY rocks! And it's a total game changer, the reason i was not so much into base building as i already spend loads of caps on duplicate plans, i wasn't even looking at camp plans any more. Now i just spent this morning hopping to all vendors and buying and discovering new cool stuff.

My husband and I play together. We each have other characters we play solo, but we've got some level 33-35 characters we play together. Been helping each other out with materials for crafting &amp; quests, set up our CAMPs so we can get around the map easier, and so on.

I personally like to break into locked player homes. What do you have in there that you’re trying to keep me from seeing? I do always repair the damage I’ve done. But still. That wall is coming down so I can take a peek

Start backwards also S is the biggest pain in the ass to snap no matter how you do it. The trick that works most of the times is to move it up and to the left just outside of the auto snap but set so it still snaps. I know it sounds weird but there is a little bit of space that allows this. A also has the same issue sometimes as the S depending on location.   
---
The whiteside of the brick wall also seems to work best overall for letters.

You might have pissed him off. Dick with a tse shotgun was blowing up cars around me so I got mine out spammed him in pacifist mode and didn't leave his side for 5 minutes. He ran from.me for a while lol 
---
He spewed out nonsensical clickbait about the game from the get go with little to no concern for the credibility of what he was saying, then got ungodly salty about the pushback, which was entirely deserved, flat out lied about the pushback, claiming it was the community as a whole targeting him and particular other personalities when it was less than 1/230th of the reddit even if we purely go by upvotes and even then not directed at particular youtubers but the entirety of gaming media AND EVEN THEN, only expressing dissapointment and disdain for the lack of unbiased reporting, not claiming 'yOuTubErs rUinEd The GaMe' like he claimed, going on to slug his fanbase of mindless followers onto the reddit who plagued us like gnats for a solid month.
---
I once liked his content, I sure as bloody hell dont now.

He preaches hes one of us, hes for us, but the reality couldnt be further from the truth, guy has a fucking god complex and loves money.

This is awesome, thank you!

They did for some, but my recipies counter stopped at 5. But I got broken bobbleheads and after patch I've been able to get it, using missing bobbleheads again. Problem is with travel ones - I can't discover again locations that are already discovered...

You could just wear assassins sentinels gear and be invincible to other players when you stand still too

I'm asking for proof because literally none exist beside 2 anecdotal comments that provide no information or proof is just dipshits spreading FUD. These antics used to be a daily thing in the DarknetMarkets sub before it got shut down blows my mind to see a gaming sub doing the same thing a bunch of paranoid high as fuck people sending drugs in the mail did.

I honestly think it's because the general public casual gamer is expecting mindless, extra pretty crap that they can forget about in a month from AAA games.  Bethesda went a bit weird with a slower paced, thoughtful game more in line with The Long Dark and other high quality indie survival games, and relegated fast paced action to the end game.  Maybe that was a mistake because a good portion of the player base doesn't stop to read terminals, notes and listen to holotapes, but some are pretty heartbreaking.  I actually got some strong allergies in my eye pits listening to a holotape I found in a mine with a man's last message meant for his only sunshine.  I had a similar experience in Fo4 when I found David's holotape in West Everett Estates.  I killed those mutants with severe prejudice and went out of my way to kill any raider I found in David's honor for several hours.  That tape hit me hard, as did the sunshine tape.

Yep, it was always an alien story, happened the night after a supposed ufo sighting

Drop boxes in an open pvp game are actually a contrivance from battle royals starting with ping. So no. Fuck off you petulant child before your parents take away your computer privileges.

It's a tiny water drinking fountain that butt up against the circular concrete wall. 
---
I think it will be there until someone picks it up.  However there seems to be a secondary item-spawn thing as well.
---
If you personally pick up an item from that location, no amount of server hopping will have that item regardless.
---
Same here. Worst it’s been since before the last update. Nothing like getting disconnected after knocking the queen down to 5%.
---
theres an inside door in whitespring resort for the enclave bunker at 3rd floor
---
Maybe we can get Todd to line them up for us ? :D
---
Toooddd, are you here ? lol
---
I have a friend in real life who was already banned for duping on Xbox after being reported. He is pissed but it is happening 
---
It's just like a water fountain near the bathrooms at any office. It's not an ornamental water fountain. That was the kicker, it wasn't descriptive enough when I looked for it. Look along the inside of the concrete wall that surrounds the gazebo.
---
Haha yeah I noticed it too (how could you not?) So annoying that it snaps fine in the preview, but when you place it, it moves on top of the other letter.
---
Ill have to try the suggestion of putting the letters down in right to left and/or everyother letter
---
So it is ok to use some of the duped stuff? 
---
I’ve been shot point blank by a TSE pump in assassins sentinels and it didn’t do anymore than chip damage, this was while I was wanted and pvp already initiated with this guy. It was for a test

I know it was a long time ago, but can you please try and remember, where approximately did that happen?
---
No one ever said scorched beasts are supposed to have this amazing loot. 
---
Only the Delberts recipes count when you read them, I had 5, but it rolled me back to 4 :(
---
You've played it for two days almost 3 months after the game came out, in which multiple patches have been released. These reviews would've come out in November. Not only are you playing a good while after, but you also haven't really played enough to actually experience any later-game bugs, or notice any real repetition in disconnects and game crashes.
---
He sure as hell gunna make a video now, oof.

Will test this as well, thanks..

Mine will be on that "cleaner" version of the metal walls, not the rusty barn walls... hope it works :/
---
Does monster mash change at all in the nuke zone? 
---
To me both the ones that i already completed (Toxic Valley and Savage Divide) and one that i completed AFTER the patch (The Mire, it's still telling me that i need to find the Valley Galleria) are still marked as uncompleted
---
Get out of there! Whatever you do, do not collect the water. You might get banned for exploiting a bug.
---
Given that the flatwoods monster is based on real world historical UFO lore, it would make sense that they made it an alien in game.
---
Please tell me youre joking about believing they were duping. Duping doesn't work if everyone disconnects. In fact it's essential that not everyone disconnect in order to dupe otherwise you only end up with your original items and not original plus duplicates

Todd was right, we dont need NPCs, check this one out!

I prefer chasing down level 5 and lower and then trying to get them to pick up the plans I drop by by shooting the floor and then turning my miners lamp on and highlighting the ground, I usually only have to chase two or three before one complies and picks up the brown bag.      
---
You should be in Market or bazaar 
---
Next time click on their maps on the map (or find them under Social &gt; Recent) and Block For Session, then fast travel away, they'll loose you.
---
Block For Session (if you aren't wanted) will hide you from their map and you also can't see them on the map.
---
Bethesda should tell use whether it's fine to install mods or not, some are a MUST and I would love to install them for quality of live purposes but I am too afraid of a ban right now.
---
Incisor is 75% penetration. How would 25% more not “do anything extra”? 
---
Depending on target damage resistance there’s a relative point of diminishing returns, however 75% off 300DR still means you have to hit through 75DR, which I assume is when anti armor applies and knocks off an additional amount. Less worthwhile the lower the DR - as incisor is anyway by default. 
---
Oh god that 200 cap limit! I encountered that last night for the first time as I decided to sell a bunch of stuff. Instantly my brain categorised that as "moronic" until it nearly imploded on itself after I found out the limit was across **all** vendors on the server. Just when you think this game can't get any worse, Bethesda find a way to be innovative on being a total dipshit.
---
I had just dumped some stuff in a trash can in the main hall of the whitepsring resort. Was trying to get someones attention to go check it out but they didn't get the hint.
---
I hopped on top of the trash, dropped a single ammo to get their attention to go over to the baggie then realize the trashcan is full of stuff. They started jumping up/down. Was funny.

Yes I enjoyed Fallout 4 but not as much as 1, 2, 3 and NV. Fallout 4 was a step back but it still had an interesting story and interesting characters. I thought the game was good. I finished it in a weekend, but I haven't played it again ever since. Unlike the other games which I have re-played many times.
---
&gt;why don't you tell me why you believe the game is so vastly different to FO4 that its score requires something vastly below FO4? 
---
I already explained this in my previous post. The fact that you missed or ignored pretty much proves my point... FO76 has no character skill system (they got rid of that in 4 already), no interesting characters (in fact, no characters at all), no dialogue, no story whatsoever. There is zero roleplay. Everything that made the previous Fallout games great is gone (unless you think Fallout is a The Sims-like game about base building which you seem to do...).
---
They even changed the setting from post-apocalyptic wasteland (1 and 2 was literally a Mad Max-like desert) to 50s small town America. There is nothing "post-apocalyptic" about Fallout 76. And the Vault Boy cartoon guy which used to be cute is now so overdone because Bethesda has to put it everywhere they can. They now people thought it was funny, so they take it and overdo it. Same with the music in the game. Fallout was a pretty dark game at first, but now they've turned it into a "fun" game where you can take selfies of yourself doing different poses... I mean wtf...
---
I seriously doubt anyone is going to have fond memories of this game in a few years from now. The previous games are classics. I'm not sure if FO4 will be considered a classic, but atleast it has some memorable moments which I would argue could be considered classic moments in video gaming, for example: &gt;!meeting Father!&lt;. Fallout 76 has none of those moments. This is evident just by browsing the threads on this forum. The type of stories you see here goes something like this: "I met a guy today who gave me some free ammo... Omg this game is so great!". Or: "To the person who didn't kill me when I met them... Thank you! Wow this game is so fun and the players are great.".
---
When I read those threads I'm like... "dude is this your first online game or something? You're impressed by this? This was worth $60??"
---
&gt; It's because you all tried to exploit it, ripped into the Atomic shop and got angry over day 1 bugs.
---
It's because it's a bad game... A bad, unfinished, barely playable and BORING game. I mean, if this was a quality MMO like say World of Warcraft or something, I could have tolerated the bugs. But it's not just buggy as hell... it's also incredibly BORING. Like I said... give this game a couple of weeks and see what you think by then. You're most likely just having a honeymoon with it now because you're excited about a new Fallout game and you just bought it. I don't know a single person who bought the game back in November who still play it today. And I got some friends who defended this game almost religiously when it came out. None of them still play it.
---
Nope, they banned dupers
---
Thank you! Overall stability and performance has been increased A LOT on Ps4 since the first week of the game. I remember not being able to use an automatic pipe gun because of the lag it would cause lol
---
Awsome thank you for the confirmation I don't care how slow it is I just want to crash every server I get in sucks for your freind thought hopefully he gets his account back and wiped 
---
I agree completely. You want to keep some or even all of it than I really don't care. You are ruining the progressive challenge of your own game but whatever. The thing is that keeping even one thing because it's rare (or whatever reason really) completely eliminates you from using the moral high ground card. You cant shame people for duping when you yourself reap the benefits. 
---
So that's the reason why I always find notes/recipe/plans at train stations! Thanks kind stranger :)
---
just tried it, it's grayed out. Nothing to repair.
---
It would also be fun to get the train cars and buses you could use to build with, like in fo4.
---
Maybe those will be part of some group city thing we can build later in the game?

My favorite is to crouch in one of their random rooms until they come back. They can’t see you’re there and when you peek around the corner they flip.

I hope so, I made a fortress with steel walls and I just feel like the foldout campers and trailers or something would be a better inside building for it over the standard building since everything is on a floor

95% of this subs believed the carry weight glitch was causing crashes yet here we are 2 patches later with no carry weight glitch and equal amount of crashing as before.

As a solo player, I'm actually enjoying fallout 76 more than fallout 4. It feels like there is just so much more to do and every little nook and cranny seems to have its own little story if you look around and explore.
---
As others have said it was a bug riddled mess when it released but credit to the devs, they have fixes most of the complaints with their patches for the most part, even their patch notes.
---
I am looking forward to seeing what sort of content they plan on releasing during the year.

I'm all melee and I always dump my random ammo in the flatwoods church for people :)

People won't admit they are getting exploit and they have no choice. maybe in 20-30 years.

So exploited people need to keep busy so they make up new hobby and they become downvote hobbyist.

You would think all the feral ghouls inside would end up as glowing ones, but the one time I tried it they didn't.
---
Cool I will try and take some inspiration from your build and work it in. one question though do you have any gun builds or is this your only build?
---
I'm glad the patch is tomorrow. Gives me one more day to farm Whitesprings for XP and get those last few levels I need to hit 100. 
---
No, the grody hood with a bandanna.

Depends on your personal moral and ethics. Me I stole it from the cheaters, so I make use of it.

Totally! Enjoy the public servers with random griefers, and people who will intentionally fuck your while shit up and laugh at you while you cry about it.

Alternatively, for an extra 10 bucks, you can just play with your friends on your own server that will never be changed.

This is exactly where I go whenever I need springs. I try to keep all my junk at 10 bulk so whenever I drop below that I make a Camp McClintock run. Best part is you don’t even have to clear enemies first and you get that precious ballistic fibre from ammo bags and military grade duct tape that normally spawns there.

Win.

That sucks man :( 
---
yong and quartering both seem to have genuine god complex problems, they seem to think their existence alone is saving the gaming industry, that without them everything would be in ruins, its insane. Their audiences arent much better either tbh.
---
you know the same thing happened to me when i traded them for some T-60 power armor and i haven’t been able to get them back from the vault after server hopping 17 times and the clothes are gone every time too and i’ve checked and the servers are different 
---
I think Scorchy has disarm, she can even disarm my knuckles.
---
I mean if this was actually a hard core survival game it would be kinda badads to fight to the death for a can of dog food? 
---
But yeah, its absurd in fo76 were you can build a fusion reactor in your back yard.
---
Bought it a few days ago.. Can't remember the last time 10€ gave me so much to enjoy :P
---
No you won't, mate
---
People are acting like a map 4 times the size of fallout 4, with new monsters, weapons, quests, events, online. lore and a bunch of new shit is a fucking mod. It takes a lot of time to create those things, it's like saying NV was a Fallout 3 mod, which it's clearly not.
---
Exactly what I do. Don't use a mic because I'm usually playing when my wife is at work and my 6 month old daughter is draped in my arms sleeping lol
---
it's basically just a Zetan Wheelchair.
---
I pre-ordered the power armor helmet version and I also played through the beta. The launch was pretty rough so I put it down a little disheartened with it. But it was the holiday season and I had a slew of games to play through so I decided to play those and wait for them to have time to patch stuff. I deleted my beta character Saturday morning and started from scratch. I don't think I had a hiccup or bug the entire 6 or so hours I played on Saturday. Yesterday I played for pretty much the whole day. I think I had 4 server crashes in that time. All I can say is all of them seem to have been inventory related. Always when I was opening my inventory or accessing a crafting station. The game would just freeze and either catch up in a few seconds or disconnect. Still though the game is in WAAAY better shape that it was on launch and I am having a lot more fun with it. Enemies don't teleport into your face and kill you before you even realize whats going on. My only grief I experienced the whole weekend other than the few DC's was this one guy that was like level 107 in super duper power armor just decided to start hacking away at me with an axe. I think I was level 8 at the time. I teleported to my camp and continued onto another path to do a quest and when I went back to my camp he had destroyed my turrets. Not sure why I guess he was bored. Having a much better experience so far and looking forward to playing more this evening. Take it for what its worth. 
---
TLDR = First impressions are everything and this game is a decent Fallout game that gave a terrible first impression in the age of bandwagons on the internet. 
---
You need to back up your reasons with proofs, that is, if you want to be taken seriously.
---
Nah, those are just regular scorch beasts. The queen is noticeably larger and a bullet sponge. Fissure Prime is located in the bottom right part of the map, maybe you might've noticed that area as a common nuking spot as well. 
---
Ugh why do the NPCs keep repeating themselves, nevermind whoever wrote their script didnt fact check at all. Todd, can you fix them? Next patch maybe?
---
Same, I am like lvl 110 and have never seen it:o
---
Hermit crabs aren't rare. They're pretty common on the highway leading down from Abbie's Bunker. Problem is they're not always that apparent as they look like old vehicles and don't attack on sight most the time. Just look like any other dull brown wreck and blend in perfectly with the scenery.
---
Solid if true. 👍
---
I found that even with regular stimpaks, if I had diluted stimpaks in my inventory, I couldn't revive people. I had to take them out before I would get the prompt. 
---
Tip: For people trying to get the field medic achievement, bounty hunt. Most of the time when you down someone with a wanted level, they often refuse to give up. This can net you multiple revives until they finally decide to give up. 
---
I have encountered several Giant Sloths, and Hermit Crabs in the Mire, and killed 3 Flatwoods Monsters (for worthless junk), I have been attacked by a Stalking Mothman twice, but he disappeared both times just before dying. Behemoths are pretty regular in a few locations, try travelling to White Springs Station, head toward the resort, and then turn left to follow the fence line, a Behemoth can regularly be found fighting with the Robots.
---
[PC] 50 cal machine receiver cannot be reversed from a prime receiver back to a standard receiver. 
---
Been disconnected a few times. Hardly an issue in my case, my pc is mega fast and I simply log back in. 
---
Minor annoyance. Not worth a wank. 
---
Duping in other bethesda games could affect the frame rate at times. Throw in multiple people doing it and the fact that were all on a server now. 
---
The game struggles when i look in my stash sometimes and you have there guys duping thousands of plans or guns.
---
What’s the behemoth lagoon?
---
Or causing the game to look like a 3 frames a minute picture show.
---
Yeah, it wasn't very obvious joke...
---
Me, Myself, and I play the game.
---
I don't have that bug, but I have noticed that the BOS underarmor (all of them, but just officer's) and the marine wetsuit, if worn under power armor, will actually cost you 54 damage resist, energy resist, and radiation resist. Enclave underarmor doesn't do this,nor does the vault suit. 
---
This is why I gave up nuking whitesprings and showing up for the nuke zone at all. I found I have had better luck going out and about hunting down legendary enemies 
---
Just because I request an item doesn't give me that item it's still part of "trading" according to the game. Without the other player accepting request you can't do anything but look at items and Mark them at least before they did the fix. 
---
Same thing happened to me at one of the Georges junkyard. It said it was unowned. So I go there and it's set up go to check the junk extractor and it had a lock. Double check the map still says unowned so I pick it just to see if it had some (I think I was looking for ballistic fiber at the time) as soon as the lock was picked the turrets turn on me I run to the dried riverbed and notice I now have a 10 cap bounty.
---
I don’t think we know anyone in our vault. Expect it’s suppose to hold 200 people are there are just 24 on a server. 
---
I thought the same thing for a couple weeks.  It is, however, a shit game that they need to heavily invest in updating.  .  I love the concept, but it's broken.  
---
That's ingenious and it looks really well laid out too - good job! :) 
---
I enjoy post like this. Thank you.
---
Level 119 and never seen one. This is brilliant information though.  You’re doing the lords work sir.
---
My non pa build could break 4-500 defense on both ballistic and energy when running low hp (all of my chars are low hp builds). Dependent on your play style you could run vanguards which is a high hp build, higher survivability but less dmg. Agi and str both have defensive skills based on the level of the perk card and how many points are distributed in each. There is also iron clad for an extra 50 defense under endurance. You could always run emergency protocol and nerd rage on a low hp build for an additional 35% defense under 20% hp. Also serendipity is a good one to have as well as the perk under agi for dodging 35% of damage for the cost of ap. I also should note emergency protocol is for pa. I use it when running nukes if I’m not in my hazmat. You will also want a good full set of sentinel armor. You can get very tanks without pa. Just can’t get good rad resist without pa or hazmat. 
---
Nothing like the feeling of acceptance by a community of "peers"
---
I haven't even been able to play with friends over the last month. Sending friend requests does absolutely nothing. 
---
I get where you're coming from but I wouldn't do it by shooting at them. It doesn't help with the situation at all. It doesn't stop them duping long term. All it does it makes you feel better.
---
Just find out who they are and report. Let Bethesda sort them out.
---
Bethesda's started already with the bans and closing exploit holes. Just help them to keep doing the same as that's the only long term fix.
---
It is fun, too bad the dupes are breaking the game: constant low fps, crashes, disconnects and a broken ingame economy...
---
Just leave it outside stations. Someone who needs it will take it if they need it. 
---
I know it's not an online game but did you play NV at launch? Was way worse, literally couldn't play sometimes, save files would get corrupted, extreme lag, bugs galore, the whole works. They patched things later and it became awesome.
---
I’ve heard the event quests that go on during nuke zones are better but have yet to play one yet. You could probably get that whole area in and be able to do swarm of suitors as well 
---
Sorry. I can/will not provide with proofs though. Believe it or not. I am stating the truth that AFAIK is true but I won’t back up with methods that other will learn and use. Screenshot will sell out my source too and I won’t do that either. As I said, I am not for or against the dupers and cheaters. 
---
Him and thejoke https://tenor.com/view/dog-you-joke-gif-9757390
---
i know 2 behemoth spawn points. one at whitespring and one at bogtown
---
Thanks for the advise
---
There's only 1 Behemoth spawn afaik. Follow Twin Lakes to the west I think down to the lower lake and he's there. 
---
But I like the spooky floating razorgrain...
---
I finally found the perpetrator 
---
Shit
---
It’s not so bad, hacker 3 is definitely recommended as it can allow you to turn off turrets/remove targeting data or deactivate certain bots in terminals.
---
The bots in the silo spawn endlessly from pods so I prefer to cripple them rather than kill em outright if I can. Take as much ammo and healing chems/items as you can and give it a go, I’ve done it 4 times solo now.
---
One big tip, once you’re in the silo and the quest is active, you can’t just leave the silo to resupply as it’ll reset all your silo progress. This doesn’t apply to deaths in the silo, if you die in there it’ll continue where you left off as long as you go straight back in.
---
Extra tip, I find flamers are pretty good for destroying multiple mainframe cores quickly when it comes to it.
---
Well, I feel like a dolt now. I always jet because it never lands and my shotguns won't do crap while they are in the air, or at least not without wasting 1k of shells.
---
Had I known what I know now I would have went heavy gun/demo expert.
---
Cool, I'll have a look once I get back to whitesprings 
---
Thanks m8. I sent Bethesda a support ticket but got a bogus reply after 3 days of nothing that related to my problem lol.
---
You'd be surprised at how many players just don't know.  I would be totally on board with registers, except that some require you to move around a bit to search.  The blue suitcases are really easy to accidentally strafe across and see a hefty stash of stuff, make a double take and grab plans, junk you need and starter legendary pieces.
---
I've been dropping stuff off at the cash registers or overseer stashes.  I am happy to know that it's not for naught.
---
I am not going to tag this as a spoiler since the OP has it in the flair:
---
If you travel to the Mountainside Bed and Breakfast, there's an Overseer journal that describes an encounter with the Flatwood Monster.  I get the impression that this may have been the Overseer's final journal entry for the original release content ... based on its content, the next story based DLC that isn't the vaults may revolve around this part of the story.
---
They downvote bugs and exploits that give them an advantage. if it is broken, they can abuse it.
---
&gt; behemoth lagoon
---
Here https://i.imgur.com/zZ6cvSM.jpg
---
But do you snipe at 300 yards with a shotgun for that one shot kill?
---
I've tried launching a nuke 3 times, and each time I've either been disconnected or the game has stopped responding. 
---
Just wanted to see if anyone had done it. 
---
Truth, only seen them in that highway.
---
I’m currently not at home or I could help more. With the right serums on top of what is mentioned I was able to break 700ed outside of pa and almost 600 balistics. The character I’m running that test build on isn’t currently high enough for me to have an excessive amount of points to play with. But once I get this one to 110ish I will be able to help a bit more. 
---
Me and your wife play together too.  Just not in game.  
---
(She calls me "Scorchy Man", and lets me set fire to her ass)
---
In heavenly voice* Hello my child, it is me. Todd
---
Cool thank you 
---
Cule story brah
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I thought it was up to 500, but what no one talks about is the original residents were probably pushing 60 years old when the vault opened...
---
Nobody blames youtubers for the state of 76, we just cant stand the circlejerk they produce..
---
With all the technology and information available to us, an idiot watches a youtube video and believes everything the mouthpiece sais, goes to a subreddit just to shitpost about it, without even the slightest curiosity into the credibility of his opinions.

The human race never cease to amaze, or disappoint.
---
Not a lady, but willing to experiment.
---
Treetops, far east. Slighty north of the fort that you turn in technical data. 70+ leather in a few minutes at most. Plus some plastic, steel, lead, clothes, bobbleheads. Very nice place to clear out quickly.
---
Oof
---
The fact that everyone is so butt hurt and defensive over the OP's post just proves his point. 
---
But fo76 is bad because it is..
---
And that will remain true until they fix it..
---
I thought it was at first, but its ear are a lot shorter and its nose is different and it has different teeth. 
---
It’s just pointless to bitch and Moan about something you hate and don’t play and likely won’t ever play look to cyber punk and outer worlds you literally don’t need fallout any more you hate the games you hate the company good wash your hands with them and move on my last cod was black ops 2 and I never plan to go back to that series ever and it feels great haven’t touch it in years and never plan to

#freeWooby
---
How long did you wait after logging in? 
---
Often when I log in it shows I have 0 health, 0 ammo, 0 fusion cores, 100% rads and I have limbs missing or I’m invisible but it sorts itself out in less than a minute or so as the game loads.
---
I thought it already did: server crash.
---
This is a pic that shouts it's need to be shared.
---
I stash stuff all over, today I put my spare plans in a workshop toolbox, because thats what people would be there for, ammo around the enclave bunker and filled the overseers camp with food, drugs and a starter pack of building junk and a water filter plan.
---
I neeeeeed that 308 bro 
---
Tomorrow 
---
Just wait til I find you. I’ll forget to turn off pacifist mode, so I can nothing about it but piss and moan lol
---
If you mean is it worth being part of the fallout series? I’d say it is, yeah. It has some good lore dealing with stuff soon after the bombs fell and it’s a lot of fun for me 
---
If you mean should this be the first Fallout game you play, probably not. It is admittedly much buggier than the other games (which is saying something because many Bethesda games are already buggy anyway) and you also might not understand as much about the world and story. I’d recommend starting off with Fallout 3, the first FPS game in the series. 
---
If you really want to know everything and see how the series has changed, start out with the original Fallout 1. 
---
Yeah, I shouldnt bitch about a game I paid 60 bucks to play... fuck me right
---
Have you reported this to Bethesda? Proof or no proof is one thing but are you helping to get this shit fixed or just talking?
---
|#conflictedupvote
---
I neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed that 308 ammo brooo
---
Narr it all just kind of depressing really. If there was a theme of fallout 76 its human fuck up. People joke about how Bethesda mangled the fallout lore and should have included the NCR. But if the NCR were in Appalachers evening wouldn’t all be dead. 
---
The randomness is kinda cool...at level 12 I was running away from a grafton monster and almost backed right into a mothman.  
---
Thanks for this. Need to cross one off for the challenge. 
---
I can see “alien” and “Flatwoods Monster” being the most complicated. 
---
Personally, I'd like to see maybe a co-op Fallout. Not online like FO76 but for example, in FO4 I would find all these amazing mods and build amazing structures etc. but noone to experience it with. That kinda got a bit lonely. So, yeah. I'd love a buddy there with me.
---
there is an event top right of the map near the bunkers, forget the name but its daily and that was the one and only time ive ever seen one so i think thats your best chance
---
Zealots doesn't change the damage for scorchbeasts, only scorched. You want Hunters for scorchbeasts, they're classed as an animal 
---
Imo I'd go for cannibalism, radiation reduction and disease reduction.  Never have to carry/cook food and water. (Idr what level you get them.)
---
kthx
---
But I am just a humble farmer. No need for violence. I can give you purified water, razorgrain and black berries.
---
The innuendo is strong with this comment.
---
So far, just talking. How to report though? 
---
We're still missing the blinding white flash of the initial detonation, be nice if everyone on the server is white screened for half a second.
---
Yeah I have yet to come across either of those myself...
---
This right here. We need a challenge, something more unpredictable than the boring queen fight, something where you actually need tactics and teamwork to win and not spam tses at the queen until it dies. Maybe have some puzzles, things to repair and maintain.
---
Ah man fog crawlers are savage! I encountered 3 of them after fighting off a hoarde of super mutants! Needless to say I was killed many times 😂
---
Except if they get gratification from the act of duping, rather than the release of an outcome.  
---
Until ~~masturbation~~ duping is resolved they will keep on spanking that monkey.
---
Yeah I see what u mean
---
sighhhhh - so since post patch i thought i was having dc and now I know they were rollbacks. Fricken-frack, trying to do quests and getting mad cause i'd almost be finished and poof-d/c and I would log back in in front of the building again. This is so infuriating!!
---
People not taking damage from TSE isn’t a bug. With the right setup you are pretty much immune to it.
---
I thought that was from hook
---

Just throw my build out there. 
---
^
---
lol :)
---
Bethesda didn't sell the rum. They licensed the name to another company.
---
Cost to travel to daily,weekly etc events is one restriction for me, when events are located in other side of the map. It would be cool, if you can go these events without paying caps. Ok. I know that then some people uses these only for "free travelling" and not do these task. Why not to respawn players back to originally location, where they were before event started or refunc caps back after a really take part of that event.
---
You may want to change that user flair to raider 
---
Unless you mean you „respond“ to dropped paperbags ;)
---
We need a response from bethesda to see if this is safe. They answer the reddit posts, I have hope
---
From my experience, it's something to do with the player's level who spawned the mobs by entering their vicinity. So, there was most likely a high level player before you.
---
I use melee and a sniper rifle. I’ve been finding a ton of .308 with the scorched lately. My last character I had to craft that kind, but with my new character I’ve been swimming in it. 
---
&gt;Hell, the rum was supossed to be glass and it's plastic or something like that.
---
It was never supposed to be plastic. A week after they made the announcement, they also clarified that the "Nuka Bottle" was a shell encasing a normal booze bottle.
---
The game was so buggy and broken that it was almost unplayable on release.
---
People are rightly angry because of that.
---
Bethesda also insulted the players on multiple occasions.
---
There is a bad history...
---
Oh, with quests, if you don't hit the *check point*, you start over. Be careful doing the DMV quest, its notorious for being almost done and having to start over.
---
The level of the enemies usually is determined by the highest level player in the area. You could be a Level 15 dealing with 1-15 enemies in Charleston or something only to come back facing Level 30-50 enemies since someone of that level is in the area. It’s most common further east you go I’ve seen however.
---
Many of the issues that plagued the game when it launched have been addressed.  From a performance perspective, the game has reached an acceptable state - at launch, frame drops were awful so they have finally put the game into **the state it should have been in at launch**.
---
The game is a lot of fun, but the biggest issues right now are duping/exploitation and the lack of any kind of end-game content.  Unless you've finished the main story and explored the entire map, these problems are fairly transparent.
---
So the big issues arise when you finish the story and explore the whole map - you're going to be competing to get kills against players whom many have purchased their main weapon with real money from a duper who exploited the game.  Most of the two-shot explosive weapons one-shot almost everything in the game.  The game was never balanced for this kind of damage output.  I believe the next patch is going to remove two-shot + explosive from legendary weapons (as it should).

---
Maybe you have something on your face and they can’t tell you 
---
lol crying about losing a base 
---
Its simple, bethesda is forcing a narrative in which "bad gamers" are responsible for the instability of their shit servers. No one outside this sub reddit buys this. Its laughable how they blame gamers for their faults.
---
He asked why the game is so hated. It's because Bethesda removed everything fans loved about the previous games. They removed the story, the characters, the dialogue, the skill system, and even the post-apocalyptic setting. And replaced it with base building, which was previously a mini-game in Fallout 4. A side activity, something to do when you wanted to take a pause from questing.
---
This is why I said people who enjoy Fallout 76 must have played the previous games for the wrong reason. They were obviously never interested much in the CORE elements of the game, like the story, the characters, the dialogue, the skill system etc. They played Fallout 4 because it was fun to build a base. And that is weird.... To exaggerate, it's like paying $60 to play Missile Command (the holotape game) on one of the terminals in FO4 and think that that is what the game is about.
---
It's an unfounded rumor with literally zero proof of any kind and despite being asked countless times no one claiming to "be in the know" (which is pretty bullshit in itself) those same folks refuse to provide more then "I saw it" which makes exactly zero sense
---
I haven't run into the Flatwood monster often but I did manage to kill him once before he vanished.     For loot he had..... drum roll please.... a ladle.    I saw that and for a good 30 seconds all I could say to myself is "Are you kidding me?"
---
Mothman is another matter.   I managed to kill him three or four times, in my newly brown pants, but I digress.   Other then the very last time I killed him he always had some ballistic fiber scrap, another kind of scrap I do not recall and some junk items including mothman wings which is more ballistic fibre.   This very last time he had no scrap but did have 1 wing and 1 neurotoxic dust.   The dust broke down into oil.
---
&gt;I'm level 102 the game is sorta fun but the experience is shit because it is plagued by bugs.
---
"sorta fun"? You invested that much time to get to level 102 in a "sorta fun" game "plagued by bugs"? Somehow that doesn't compute.
---
Sounds like the problem is the 10 minute save being exploited. Solution: force a save after any player trade. Am I taking crazy pills?
---
 A few extra saves to neuter this behavior sounds like a fair tradeoff especially given the network resources being wasted to attempt this garbage.
---
X-men items?
---
Charlestown Fire station gym - 118 lead???? Oh my God, i’m screaming, my eyes are watering, i’m legit gonna cry. I’m gonna loot the hell out of that place tonight. Thank You for the tip, you are a gift! 😍
---
There’s also a floating rock just south of The General’s Steakhouse. You’ll need marsupial and a jet pack to get up on it
---
Innuendo? Where lol I don't see it (insert ray charles meme)
---
Some high level player has just been in the Tunnel, or still is, that's why you are seeing high lv enemies...
---
I didn't kill him though. That makes me an average douchebag
---
Oh, so it’s Bethesda’s fault
---
I am talking about not moving a bit. 
---
With the right setup you are talking about Sentinel and Assassin armor pieces. But that’s only 75% and I believe is 40% damage reduction and need to either stand still or sprinting (another prefix) to achieve.
---
That won’t let your health bar not move a bit while people shooting at your face. 
---
The damage has already been done stop wasting your time and just play for what you want to do. 
---
I can dig it.  Personally, I think .dll mods are a little more fuzzy and gray than just .ba2 mods. Going off the rules and what has happened in the past thought, I would call them safe still.  People have done at least a little digging and found that the 76 executable does look for things, but right now all it looks for is specifically Cheat Engine. 
---
I definitely would not fault anyone for being cautious, but as of right now mods, including Reshades are at defcon "probably okay". 
---
I know that in the last ban wave, a lot of people banned using cheat engine tried to blame reshades and other mods but it is unclear whether they were being honest about their situation. Considering that being publicly dishonest about why they were banned is common practice for people using hack applications, there is at least reasonable doubt for those stories. 
---
It been just 20 years. Sure many of vaults residents are in there 50s but I don’t think we’ve seen the last of vault 76 residence. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if we find the place brimming with corpses when we do eventually go back inside. 
---
One of the entries you can read in the security logs before you leave the vault is that the air is soon to be shut off. 
---
&gt;that almost everybody that played it since release is dead wrong about it.
---
\*Almost everyone\*? I get the impression that a majority of people who've played it are actually have a really good time.  
---
Thanks. They should have in game support button tbh. 
---
Fantastic game compared to what? I'm going to assume you just picked up gaming as a hobby?
---
Good to know. 
---
Wasn’t referring to sentinel. Having dense mod + rank 3 fireproof makes you immune to them.
---
Make it a big spawn of high level with decent chance of legendary. everyone will come soon.
---
There is an usine of communist robot on the map. Maybe simulate an invasion ? or varying invasion of ghoule/mutant/robot on different part of the map ? that could be fun
---
Is there any chance that the update on this effected consoles in some way? Since the PC update I've gotten loads of achievements that I would imagine I should have had already. 
---
Might be in my head. 
---
Its a bug....I killed a scorched level 5 maybe with over 100 hunting rifle and a few various other low level weapons.
---
That’s not true, the game made you climb the tallest mountain to see what was there. Oh look, there is something interesting in the distance, let’s look and see what it is, perhaps there might be something useful there. The games you describe aren’t the same as fallout. There isn’t as much attention to novelty in what you may find that doesn’t necessarily further the main story but creates a rich world.
---
I used about the same time to do it by mylf too. But just I was gonna select, where to lauch nuke. Some other player walks in without shooting etc and launched the nuke some random place. This was my latest time, when some game made me a shed a couple of tears.
---
Learned ALL the mods that day....
---
That'd be great! Although I don't have any friends that play Fallout. They're all stuck in more primitive games.
---
I have been gaming since Mario and Sonic were arch enemies, mate. 
---
How long have you been gaming? It's the newer generation who don't understand gaming, in my experience. 
---
No because it's not 6 trillion unique items. It's a single item with a number next to it. At least thats the easiest way to explain how the server sees and treats it. The server is also never rendering any of those fusion cores at any point. 
---
What loot did yours drop? Mine dropped me some wooden blocks and crystal shards :(
---
Spoilers for those who haven't read the Westek terminals:
---
[I think the Flatwood monster isn't a Zetan, just coincidentally looks like one. There is a terminal entry about an FEV mutant that developed a hyper sensitive nervous system. I am betting that is this cryptids origin. It would make sense given it's mind control power and the fact the terminal entry stated it was in constant pain so a floaty chair thingy may compensate for that. Not ruling out Zetan though since it counts for the alien achievement.](/spoiler)
---
But what do I know? I'm just a bear.
---
[](/flutterwhoa)
---
Not everyone, I don't have any tse weapons or stacked bobbleheads, and I rarely get kicked from a server, I've only seen 2 people with tse weapons in the time I have played.
---
Thanks, keep having people insist it’s just a display bug but it clearly isn’t if you use it.  I only really notice big time fighting scorchbeasts especially more than one
---
Yes. I know that but that only negate explosive damage and is not foolproof either. If you are immune that means your gun is doing low damage. With gun that have higher damage, it will still kill. 
---
The game seems to suggest that at least the location of the scorched is unique to the location. They are the result of enclave lab tests. But yeah, there could be more Queens. But I feel like the game needs to progress beyond the scorched plague. Early on it is established that the plague must be defeated or humanity will never stand a chance and they will take over what is left of the world. In future games we see that the scorched are no longer around. So evidently at some point we have to get rid of them for good.
---
Yeah, and he was DUPED by his own propaganda.
---
You should post proof before treating rumors that themselves are just hearsay at best as facts 
---
and it has sooo many mods
---
Lucky 
---
Kill me now. I've always thrown away anything with the Hunter's prefix thinking it was useless. Can't believe I didn't make that connection.
---
It’s not so bad with the perk card loadout mod, which at least it sounds like they plan to implement it into the game in some form eventually (they as in Bethesda)
---
Best you could do to force pvp is wait and check your map is someone is on their workshop. Trying to take it instantly flags them so you can pretty much activate the workshop, attack them and then leave.
---
A Shame you taste hasn't evolved for the better considering all that time then. Your loss..
---
For screws.
---
There is a place on the west side of the map. If you look directly south of the Mothman logo on the map you see a duck in the river, just South East of that duck is a place called Silva Homestead. Stand on the road and look South East towards the pylon and the silo and inside the house that is quite lit up is a house where kids must have lived, there are usually toys (toy cars, trucks and a Giddyup Buttercup) in there for screws. There are only 2 or 3 ghouls in there.
---
Does auto-stim armor only use regular Stimpacks as well?
---
With the right Perk alcohol works. 
---
They should have a lot of things...
---
In due time hopefully :)
---
Sent a request
---
I did experience my first progress-losing disconnect after the recent patch in which I disconnected and lost a noticeable but nonessential amount of dirty water that I was gathering to make razorgrain soups.  Whether it was due to duping is unknown to me.
---
It only happened once and no more.
---
Easier on Xbox I think because you can share your game with another Xbox and you use a Windows 10 device ( I use a surface tablet which uses the Xbox controller) to stream another instance of the game.
---
Hurts ups ! srry man
---
I feel like people who use the term "adulting" should be thrown off a cliff 
---
I got 40+ stimpacks once. That was a pleasant bug.
---
&gt;no story whatsoever.
---
Are you kidding me? You haven't played FO76. In my opinion, it has one of the most well-crafted maps in the series, and the story is amazing.  The way it unfolds in layers as you explore and learn about the different groups is great, and when you finally start to unravel what happened in WV during those early years after the bombs dropped...holy shit.  To me, it's one of the better FO expositions in the series.  
---
Now I feel a bit sad because I've killed multiple crippled aliens.
---
A handful you can't learn on your own ass well. I just got a new receiver from a treasure map the other night....haven't picked up this gun in ages even.
---
It was like this for me for what seems like the longest since the last patch. However, over the past five or so days, it's almost as though the game has been "apologising" to me by giving me more of them than I know what yo do with. I went weeks without a single one, and now... I have 17 or so of them.
---
Yeah, especially in this case there's a lot of new assets for the map like the basic ground texture and all the trees. That stuff takes time, it's way different than a mod. And they not only reworked the engine to support multiplayer but they also created new rendering systems for weather and other graphics
---
Yeah, this is a good idea.   But I think Bethesda needs to start focusing on quality over quantity with drops.  A 3-star legendary mob should always drop a 3-star legendary item.
---
No people are likely downvoting because this place has become rampant with rumors that end up being entirely fake yet the mob believes in some of these hoax without proof any any sort ever being posted. So even if OP is telling the truth without some sort of evidence folks are just fed up with it.
---
Not saying that's how I feel just how I see the state of the sub
---
Are you a self proclaimed guru of gaming? 
---
Not sure what authority your judgement comes from. Who are you? Have you moved out of your mothers house yet? You sound like a basement boy tbh. 
---
Its never late for the vegetal adhesive train man!
---
Nuked airport was kinda okay, tons of Flux (from mutafruit plants), decent amount of glowing ghouls. 
---
Then I nuked Charleston, but it was meh. 
---
I've heard and can sort of confirm the 20hrs, but I think the counter starts when you first interact with a vendor after it has reset.
---
Ex: you haven't played in a few days so all your vendors are reset. You interact with one to sell, leaving it with 50 caps left. Reset Timer starts. You come back 3hrs later to sell more and empty the vendor, without affecting the timer.
---
Stuff like this is going to make me stop playing for a period of time. I only play so many hours as it is and don't have the time to do things 2,3 or 4 times.
---
He seems to be the rarest Cryptid, but you’ll know he’s near. There’s a weird buzzing noise, along with a bright purple light whenever he appears
---
Dodgy, Serendipity, Fireproof, Lone Wanderer, Are mandatory for the build to work. It won’t always save you from death it buys you enough time to kill the people attacking you. It isn’t god mode. 
---
I think there was something similar is Skyrim. It would go into the throat slit animation and everything. 
---
I can't live without my grilled rad stag, as it is one that gives you +20 carry weight.
---
iTs fReE ReAL EsTate...
---
Agreed, I got it on launch day and have had a ball with it since day one.
---
Cavalier only applies while sprinting.
---
Is there any particular place where you noticed you were able to find them?
---
The events have time factors.  the "daily" means you can do them for rewards once a day.
---
It dropped Nothing lol it glitched, I was able to walk right through him  hence I was able to get these pics
---
You're going to get a lot of downvotes and abusive messages for this post, friend. :(
---
And here comes the auto hate starter pack. Nice try kid.
---
The duping is honestly what’s stopping me playing.
---
I tried swarm of suitors last night and the "horde" wasn't spawning. I had one more lurk show up and get highlighted with a quest marker and then waited another ten minutes. I gave up out of boredom before the time ran out. Are you just supposed to hang out for the whole time?
---
Can we get Killer Queen to play after? :p
---
I used to have a base about half way between Summersville and Whitespring,  SE of Summersville, NW of Whitespring. If you look on the map it was near a bunch of drawn trees to the left of drawn cliffs/mountains and encountered it around there at least 20 times. I had to move as I was low level and would eat through stims just trying to get away from it! Sometimes it would be in the wooded area around there, others taking a stroll along the road south of Summersville by the lake. 
---
just read what it is on the screen then and think about integrity again.
---
Twice a session is annoying enough; kind of makes it a waste of caps to take a workshop. 
---
Didn't you just come in with judgements about my taste and how it's shame? 
---
Wasn't that said with a chip on your shoulder as you assume position above me? 
---
I got some today, they are drop less often though.
---
Thank you. I don't intend to exploit this (in fact, I hardly okay anymore due to the instability and lack of content), but I was curious how it worked. 
---
I also see that you're getting downvoted. I understand that people want to suppress this information as much as possible, but I'd argue that it's detrimental to silence the people raising awareness. If we make a huge stink out of it and spread the info like wildfire, then it'll get fixed sooner.
---
It makes one of the best monsters in the game nothing more than a pest that is really annoying, especially when they none stop death ray you, take ages to kill if you don't have a super weapon and when you kill them, the loot is pathetic. 
---
I get 3 caps off a super mutant which is worth more that what you get from a SB making a SB one of the most worthless creatures in the game for time-to-kill vs rewards, doesn't it?
---
Ah, interesting.  Thanks.
---
often dropped by enemies at morgatown airport, or check all the buildings and tents there, you will also get a lot of stimpacks :)
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer - Please send up a request to bring back the "Block" option (the one that was there in the past - that was taken away at some point).  "Block for Session" isn't permanent enough.
---
I have no desire to EVER interact with witch hunters or cheaters in any way.  I just want to play.. you know.. normally.
---
Where did you see that ? Cause they usually do t start until after 8am EST
---
Being an apparel collector would you like a clean mining helmet 
---
Could be an amalgamation of the two, it may have been zetan once, either killed or captured by the government and given to west-tec to be experimented upon, maybe with FEV
---
Me and the people I usually group up with have noticed this as well. I think combined we've found maybe 10 in the past week.
---
They will add mod support 
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/fallout-76-will-have-mod-support-but-not-at-launch/
---
But only once fallout 76 is „done“
---
What „done“ means it up to anyone’s speculation 
---
104 bobby pins for me, was around lvl3 so was a nice boost, still using them to this day.
---
I’m in a similar situation, my boyfriend’s best friend thinks this is call of duty. He’s always low on junk, doesn’t know how to play expect shooting at enemies 10x times stronger than him, and then whining because he dies and I won’t waste stimpacks because he’s a noob. Also he always whining about his camp and wants me to bulit it for him but he doesn’t have any plans at all because he legit doesn’t know how to loot. (I wish I was joking) once a really nice high level player did the same event as us and helped us big time, then this asshole started to shot at him because it’s “funny and he is only joking” I was so embarassed... since than I just ignore his party requests, i know it’s rude as hell but he won’t ruin this game for me! So i’m really interested how to block a player without the player knowing it. 
---
Sorry for not giving you any tips, but at least you know that you are not alone with this problem and I totally feel your pain😂❤️
---
I'm finding them randomly throughout the map, but I was hanging around the Whitespring for a day or two trying to hunt down the non existent golfers when they started to show back up.
---
Boredom
---
I don't understand why a lot of people are piling hate on you. If you're looking for a sub of players who genuinely enjoy the game minus all the whining, do pop by /r/fo76filthycasuals!
---
The game is not perfect, I personally enjoy the quests, atmosphere and CAMP building. Glad you're liking the game too! 
---
It may happen you get disconnected during important things like the final boss encounter etc, but that's it. Been playing since the first week of release just fine. Grouping with people also help you to get back on the same server. I've played online for the latest 20 years and I can't remember any MMO launch without problems. People overreacting and/or monetising the circlejerk: at this point comparing Fo76 to shit makes you revenue, visits, clicks, traffic. The internet is a bad place mate, just enjoy the game.. it's fo4 with many server/client implementation and future expansion possibilities. I just suggest you to join the discord hub market, trading and generally interacting with other people, increase the quality of the game exponentially
---
I believe they posted it on their twitter account
---
No, but OP makes a valid point. You may as well avoid rather than engage if it doesn’t reward you or more to the point; leaves you worse off (net down on resources).
---
I use to find a-lot doing runs in the earlier levels of the game.    Since last patch my runs have brought 0 finds. 
---
I think you can get them at any level at grafton station, just takes a bit of server hopping usually
---
Got it free with an Xbox one X I bought to play red dead 2 (damn you for not releasing on PC). Anyway being a fallout fan I installed and played 76 despite not thinking I’d like it as I liked the RPG aspect. I found it ok (5/10) but my gf picked it up and loved aimlessly gathering and camps. She also commented it would be more fun together, we are both PC gamers and thanks to the games shit reviews we got 2 more copies on PC for £8 each and now play together most evenings. With at least one other person to play with the game is more like an 8/10, still got my issues with lack of npcs, lack of emotional investment in quests and characters and general buggyness. Still we very much enjoy it, I’d have put it down by now single player which is why my advice for anyone looking at this game is to at least play duo.
---
Well, as soon as you hit 50 (for me at least) there are scorchbeast everywhere, and they 70% beeline to you. Then for a few levels, they will ignore you unless provoked, then the bee line you again as you go up. I did find a Gatling Gun which will slowly damage it enough to finally kill one solo, since almost every one I see now tries to kill me. 
---
my wife and I play together. she was a big fan of Fallout 4. we work our perks and load out together for our team.
---
There have been three major patches that have removed the worst of the exploits, fixed the worst of the bugs (some of which rolled back quest progress or broke quests to where you had to start a new character if you wanted to move forward in the story) and improved stability. 
---
If you started playing back when you’d dc every half hour, you’d have complained too. 
---
Obviously things are better now. 
---
I’m sick of these posts. Do you really not understand that your experience might differ from that of others?
---
The fact that you only got it this weekend contributes to a lot to your not understanding the hate.
---
Bethesda deserves a LOT of the hate they got their way. Don't know how much of the history of the games lead-up and release but there's a TON of things Bethesda did wrong or screwed up that deserved criticism.
---
Having said that, there was also a ton of unfair criticism as well. Continual misrepresentation about no NPCs (people seem to keep forgetting to add human NPCs), unfair criticism of the game from people with very little time put into the game, people insisting of looking at the game through the lens of a single player RPG even when it was made clear pretty early on to NOT expect this etc.
---
The game is in a much better state now than from launch. Far from done though but considerably better all the same. 
---
That's probably why you don't understand. I don't agree with ALL of the hate but if you followed it all, you should at least understand it.
---
I found vault-tec jumpsuit plans, I haven't seen anyone else wearing it, so I made a bunch and sold them to a Whitesprings store.  It is the perfect outfit for my service station CAMP.
---
Spend your caps buying tse weapons you dont need and pss them out to players that dont have them!
---
It's the same with scrapping - sometimes that selecion highlight doesn't go where the mouse actually goes and ....byeeeeeeeeee!
---
I like doing a high rad build, so get radicool under END, Gives +5 str. 
---
 bloody mess in luck.
---
Glow sight in PER.
---
I swap between thru hiker and adrenaline in agi
---
I got a lot invested in INT so I can have the 'breaks x% more slowly' on PA and melee and ballistics.
---
Being in or out of pa has nothing to do with the suggestion above you 
---
Yeah, airport is pretty good. Probably best after whitespring.
---
If you don't get gazillion dollar bonus you are not living, right?
---
I've had the occasional crash and disconnect over my 65+ levels but nothing like last night
---
It’s ok 
---
„Pillage, loot and murder“ are our morales. It doesn’t need to be all three at once. One condition also suffices to earn the title 
---
Few bugs and a shitty bag in the collectors edition and exploitable power armour.
---
They are the only things I see people banging on about. Is there more dude? What have I missed? :( 
---
Honestly I truly hope one of the DLCs is a Zetan invasion.
---
It's not even the time factor though. One had no timer, the other has 24 hours. Both gone within an hour of getting them.
---
That after joining Reddit how little I know about the game lmao!
---
Ahhh, so it's like the fountain an actual human being would use not just some generic source of water that our wasteland wandered might drink from, thanks!
---
I agree to some extend. I never thought the game itself was that bad. I've enjoyed it immensely, but I do recognize that it has flaws. Still, and particularly around launch, it felt like a rushed product. There were a lot of massive bugs that made it difficult to understand how they could release the game in such a state.
---
TL;DR: Bethesda has fucked up far too much as a company and it's difficult to keep faith in them, but ignoring that the game is fun!
---
Furthermore and worst of all, in my opinion, is how Bethesda has acted and portrayed themselves as a company. They did rush a very buggy product rather than ensuring a stable launch. The incredibly fast price drops that left a lot of players having spent twice as much only a month later. They did lie about the canvas bag and offered poor compensation - Only to them offer the right one with up to a 6 month wait.. Their refund policy of "If you downloaded it, you can't refund" is kind of scummy. The personal information leaks. The duping issue that greatly impacted the game economy and Bethesda took a loooong time to address it rather than hotfixing it. The same with the carry weight bug. Misleading and potentially illegal pricing practices on the Atom Shop, where a half-price sale was put up without ever having been up for the full price. The Atom Shop prices were also quite high in general. To top it all off, Bethesda have been really poor with their communication, even after promising to do better. The patch notes have improved, but there's still a lot of changes sneaking in that they don't write and they don't communicate much in general with the community.
---
But! If you don't care about all that and just play the game it's not that bad :P The game is enjoyable.
---
... i hate to say it, but apparently they were testing this on PS4 last night.  Or something else was going on.  (Maybe something else but).
---
Had one of the worse  nights game-wife.  Multiple disconnects in a short time span.  But one thing I noticed - I wo uldn't be in the same area I was when I disconnected.  For example, I was finishing up the Firebreather quest (yeah, another alt... /sigh my curse...) at Belching Betty.  DC - Loaded back up and I was at Charleston Train Station, without my firebreather gear.
---
Second time was same character, about 40 minutes later.  Still in firebreather gear, but was moving towards Palace of the Winding Path (starting point for my trek to Top o the World).  DC'd. Came back in to my camp, with the waypoints I KNOW i discovered gone off my map.
---
Nice try spreading fake rumors 
---
Guy says he likes a game with his buddy,  ok cool. Then you act like he's new to games because of a different opinion.  
---
I don't understand reddit half the time,  go to sub dedicated to a game to insult people who like the game.  Does it make you feel better about yourself?  Are you so lonely that any form of attention makes you happy?  
---
Most of the hate stems from poor launch, lackluster main quest (i.e robot/"ghost" fetch quest galore) poor stability, etc etc.
---
I was dissapointed in bethesda like many others, especially for those that pre-ordered the more expensive editions, they have every right to be mad. game is mad boring at times.
---
but... with that being said: brotherhood was my fave questline, fealt like you were actually doing something with your time, which is why i wear full brotherhood armor and jumpsuit, im restarting the west virgina chapter
---
NO! IT'S NOT TRUE! I AM A RESPONDER!! I HELP THOSE IN NEED!
---
I found mine in a caravan with a shower that had question marks in chalk on the wall.  There is a dead guy hiding in there with the hat on. 
---
Of course i do. But the odd DC and "I can get power armour right now, that sucks" doesn't make a bad game. 
---
As you say, the bugs are fixed (and were always going to be). I understand the initial rush to play and not being able to being a wind up...but those days ended pretty fucking quickly. 
---
You are a genius.  Everyone whines, you find a workaround.
---
Ok go get em champ you're batman now
---
That's fine, I just want to keep the spread of rumours down to a minimum since this game lacks any decent documentation anyway
---
I totally am I just meant best way to deal with it in the upcoming weeks while I'm playing I can't be assed crashing and would prefer to just deal with them 
---
That is correct, it is multiplied.
---
Following.
---
&gt;dropping legendaries on the ground 
---
... can I be your neighbor?
---
Only, resources aren't real. And they are easily replaceable, even screws, gears, springs and even ballistic fibers. The world is lousy with ammo, and the materials to make ammo.
---
The point the OP was making is that they aren't worth fighting, *because* there's no good loot. No one ever said there was. 
---
In fact, the game kind of makes a point of telling you to avoid them, and that you should seek cover if you are attacked.
---
But if people just look at everything in a game as, Hard to kill should be rewarded with stuff that is appropriate to how hard it was, you've set yourself up for disappointment. 
---
But if it wasn't for disappointment, some people wouldn't have any appointment. 
---
I think you gravely overestimate an average developer's income.
---
Did you "untrack" the miscellaneous side quest for when you die, the one that is "Pickup dropped loot"? It will place a diamond marker on your bag as you approach it, so you won't make that mistake in the craziness that is the nuke zone. 
---
[how I really feel](https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc)

Words can’t express how I feel, so I’ll let YouTube do the talking.

I got a switch with the advanced power connectors plan but I don’t know about wall switches 
---
Queen, queen fights i say, lol  (they are always a lot of fun, and never the same)
---
Or setup a nice comfy chair next to you missile turret, and just sit and watch it make "meat" for you when enemies spawn, i love it :D
---
I am also always hovering between 23-25k in caps, but there is always that "one" plan you haven't found, so i go plan hunting..
---
Read somewhere that there is about 900 plans in this game ?
---
Heh.. I end up rolling a new character when I get a good weapon. I do share as much as I can, but I'm still playing the game for me, not for others.
---
😁
---
being realistic about that, i can imagine complains about it alllll the time on the forums
---
:) Just saw this message now. The best thing we can do is honor the memories by living well and carrying what they taught us forward.
---
Ehh. Over three months this question have already been answered. Please use search option to find your answered. Have a good day. 
---
Strange in numbers perk oversees the positive effects of all mutations when in a party with other people who also have mutations. I haven't tried to do a comparison, but assumably it would increase the speed buff from speed demon.
---
You're trying to hard, there is no rhyme or reason to anything Bethesda does these days. Any lore or logical sense to their guns went down the drain in FO4, they shit all over the lore they could've continued from FO3 &amp; NV. They knew they had to add more guns to the game so they slapped together some renders of a MG42, a M2 and a Mk19 and called it good. 
---
This is what I don’t understand about this at all. The server and the database are 2 completely separate entities. Any time a transaction of any type occurs (trade, loot, drop, etc.) the database should in theory be immediately queried and updated to reflect the current state. “Rolling back the server” as people are referring to it would (should) have no effect whatsoever on people’s inventory items as those are all stored in a database that would never be rolled back or altered unless something went catastrophically wrong.
---
Either people don’t understand how these types of games work or Bethesda has created some kind of bizarre system that makes absolutely no sense.
---
I thought it was later today. 
---
yup it is in advanced power connectors
---
Sure, Im right beside the substation north of watoga that spawns the like 90+ deathclaw.
---
Well with a bit of luck the “permanent fix” is permanent. Duping was tied to forcing a rollback so if there are no rollbacks no duping should occur again. The items will never leave the game but the random crashes of millions of weight being moved around should hopefully go. Hopefully.
---
I completly agree with you! I killed one honeybeast, saw the flatwoods monster once and the mothman once. I really want to see a sloth😍 is there a specific place for him?😱
---
lol, its their database! they see all - as demonstrated by the bans being handed out to people caught with dev room items. They dont NEED people to report dupers, and they lack the will to ban them anyway. Just get on and play the game.
---
It's such bullshit when you take into consideration that people have work/school and have set that time aside in the evenings or over the weekend to unwind, and the product they bought can't even be used.
---
Thank you so much! Tried to find one correct playlist but couldn't find one! Thank you!

and my first build was a sneaky sniper but I didn't like it.  It was viable just not my style.

My next builds are going to be automatic weapons builds to try a few things and those should be interesting.

Camden Park has several can chime traps on the way to the raider camp in the middle. Super easy/fast.

Dropped loot? Like my junk?

Ok. You want lead?
---
Grab your excavator armour. Head to the Lucky Hole Mine, it's South-South-East of the Monorail Elevator, West of Fort Defiance.
---
Be thorough and look for lead veins. The excavator armor is key here as it vastly increases yields from veins. You will leave with a LOT of lead ore.

Head to camp and go to a Chemist Workbench. If you have Super Duper in the Luck tree, enable it. If you don't, get it as soon as you can (lvl 50 perk though).
---
Sit back and smelt somewhere between somewhere around 1,500 Lead, it varies thanks to Super Duper, but even without it you'll get close to 1,000.
---
I have made so much lead I can't find enough steel to keep up with it. Yeah, steel is the material I need the most when playing a ballistic character, oh that and acid. 
---
Okay, now I don't feel sorry for him
---
Saw it in a discount bin for $7.99 on a reddit post yesterday lol 
---
I just found an explosive shotgun a few days ago. The only time I really use it is to kill the robot army attacking Phoenix, the vendor. It's definitely not fun to play with on the reg. 
---
Yeah! I keep thinking it would be cool if there was an event where ships keep arriving/crashing (a bit like the event in FO4 but... More.)
---
Just leave op nobody wants you here
---
I mean, the M60E3/4 is still in use by special boys.
---
Don't do mutations at all, nor do I use P-A outside nuke zones.
---
Thank god as I never got the ID card for the bunker somehow. My friends got there's and had to let me in then one of them found that side door with the hand scanner. &gt;!I have no idea why I didn't get the ID card I did the Sam Blackwell (?) mission, found the painting but somehow never got the card. I even went back there but no joy ;/!&lt;
---
Rolling back the server state should not in any way roll back the database which is what actually stores player’s inventories and states. If you drop an item the database would immediately be queried to reflect that you no longer have that item. This is completely separate from the game server, so rolling back the game server to an earlier state isn’t going to have any effect on in game items.
---
Because it fires 900-1200 rounds per minute but weighs much less than a minigun?
---
Last 3 Queen fights I did bugged. 2 had to loot glitch where it showed the weight of the loot but no items, and the third she fly away off the bottom of the map.
---
Anyway.. that's not solving the resource problem, that gives me more! haha.. including heavy flux, plans that I have 50 of, for a useless power armor set and prime receivers that make no sense to maintain. When I oneshot almost everything.
---
I got two shot handmade, just one star but its amazing. If you want it i can give it to you for something else, becouse i got TSE handmade now. Im still using the two shot one, becouse its cleaner and you dont oneshot everything
---
Oh my God??!?!? I’m lvl 52 (I know I know) but I don’t have that perk sadly. :( 
---
Alright thanks I didn't know how they planned on fixing it thanks for the info 
---
I want to play with my hubby. But we only have the one Xbox..and he can’t get “into” fallout 76 like he did fallout 4. I think it’s because when he left the vault he was killed in like 5 seconds 🤣🤣
---
Flatwoods cryptic is pretty flat if you catch my drift lmao
---
Nice builds 
---
Advanced power plans. Got mine at Harper's ferry vendor and have seen at watoga. Server hopped a few time but the finally showed up.
---
Lord knows you get the best loot from them and all the super lucrative pre war money. LMFAO 
---
Alternatively alternatively, drop this shit game and play something else you already own for free!
---
Dupe your dupe dupe please.
---
I haven't tested as I have both it and born survivor, but it appears to choose the stimpak based on how fast you're losing health 
---
(noticed when I'm getting attacked by a lot of things and losing health quickly it will use a super stimpak or normal stimpak, whereas if i'm being attacked by one thing or losing health slowly it uses a diluted stimpak)
---
&gt;But the odd DC and "I can get power armour right now, that sucks" doesn't make a bad game.
---
You’re right, it doesn’t. But that’s not at all what happened. We had dupers constantly crashing servers on PC until the patch last week, and I haven’t personally had problems, but people are reporting worse stability since the patch, not better. Look on the front page of this sub and you’ll see such posts. 
---
I’m super glad you’re enjoying yourself, but you have no idea what you’re talking about.  
---
Not sure why you think this is not possible. Most days I cant play but 2 hours. I am lvl 81, if I was in high school or didnt have a wife, child and job then i could easily be lvl 300 without duping.
---
I'm currently doing my best to spend money on anything I can to constantly avoid the cap limit. I've recently been buying out all the mutation serums, but I know eventually those will all be learned. We either need to remove the cap limit and drastically increase stash size, or create more sinks for resources. The FOnline games did this amazingly...you lose ALL your gear you're carrying when you die, and while that's harsh, it gives you a reason to keep making top tier guns and thousands of ammo and to collect all the good stuff you find. There are cars that cost up to hundreds of thousands of caps, very rare dungeon loot implants that you can spend hundreds of thousands of caps on using, and in general extremely rare loot. If somebody finds a power armor or advanced power armor set with bonuses like +ap, -crit roll, and +resistances, you can bet people will be bidding millions on that. Those games are just fan-made by a handful of devs on a modified fallout 2 engine, and yet they got that endgame part so much better than these devs did
---
Me and my crew are all in the mid 100’s and we have low level alts for mules.  
---
Not every low lvl/high is a duper.  
---
Amazing job!!  Thank you so much for sharing!
---
Side note:  Why is everyone always dehydrated when taking their FO photos?? lol
---
I play with my 17 month old ..I’ll give her a dead controller and we play shoot the bad things 🤣🤣
---
There were a few times this weekend after loading to the main menu, instead of displaying Play, it said Join Team or something to that effect. This wasn't after disconnecting, those auto rejoined, this was fresh loads.
---

---
I dont know how to do what you just did sooooo tadaaa
---
I don't know. After the main story line is pretty much complete there's not much to do. Not saying I don't enjoy it but I feel like it's quite limited and don't see much more than repeating events. It's your basic run of the mill loot game which also brings in what loot games bring with it. Exploiters and dupers and people that just want a quick way to get said loot. For a fallout game the map is pretty small and limited. I'm level 70 now so I have put the time into it and even avoided the main/enclave questline till about level 30 and it didn't take long to get to the whole silo part. Bethesda is relying on the community to identify, fix and even come up with content. It's lazy as shit. I appreciate that they want to have the voice of the community to shape the games future but I just want to go out complete missions and feel like I haven't paid full price for a game that doesn't feel finished. Again, it's all opinion based and we play what we like and like what we play. Not hating but I think they put in the least amount of effort
---
Those people who visited dev room and who have multiple copy of items are reportedly getting banned.
---
Don't sweat it. I'm level 66 and have done this a couple times. I still have not launched my first nuke. 
---
...Dried up Toxic River...
---
Game was more buggy on release with some big issues is why it had poor reception. With that being said, the game was NOT as bad as people were saying on YT... They keep showing the same clips from the beta as if it's an accurate representation of the game now and keep with the message that this game is DOA and a dumpster fire. The game is good, but it isn't a perfect game by any means. Beth is working hard it seems to make this what they envisioned, I am along for the ride. Lvl 92 here with like 160 hours in.
---
Game “news” channels hate on it and make multiple videos on it due to not a lot of game news going on so they try to find ways to make a ten minute video saying the same thing despite not playing it and it practically ruined everyone’s motivation to play it.
---
It wouldnt be so bad if they werent being duped. I imagine its a hard drop to get.
---
The YouTube clip matches my reaction better
---
Camden park is good for leather too. At least 40+ in one run from all the teddy bears there. Each teddy scraps for 3 leather.
---
Hope they don't fix fusion core bug been using the same 1 for a month
---
Remindme 1 Day! 
---
that's truth, just google "real wedding in fallout 76"
---
I truly hope so and I hope they get the duppers too I know they not gonna be able to get all of them but at least the main ones that are still doing it
---
One thing I don’t like however is the lack of more quests because when you complete all of them you may not feel like you need to keep playing which is a bit depressing but I’m sure later they will add some
---
Off the top of my head, so could miss a lot but:
---
* Insultingly short beta, which really was a server stress test with limited time play windows
---
* Beta access was initially locked behind a paywall (pre-orders). That was later opened up when people who were already in the beta got free codes to give out.
---
* Price was HEAVILY discounted only a couple of weeks after launch due to Black Friday. Pre-order people and at launch purchasers were understandably PISSED off.
---
* Poor customer service generally (there were a number of cases of that which involve the nylon bag and refunds due to the heavy discounts of Black Friday)
---
* A major reluctance to add popular features like PoV slider/Ultra-wide support and fix decades-long engine bugs like the the 60 fps lock due to physics being tied to fps.
---
* Poor/hacky implementation of features when they were given i.e. ultra-wide screen just stretching out the elements.
---
* Nuka Rum controversy
---
* This one is a minor one but the Prima guide being pretty much useless in terms of things you'd expect to see e.g. list of available mods.
---
* For a very long time non-communication by PR or community managers to respond to player feedback or issues.
---
* Quietly nerfing certain features in the background without including them in the patch notes or given reasons for them
---
In short, it seems that the community, media and influencers had to drag Bethesda kicking and screaming to just do the right thing. If the community and the media were more complacent and didn't push so much, we'd be in a much worse position than we are now.
---
Drop anything that is too high level
---
Or, and just hear me out here... You could offer something in exchange instead of just begging.
---
How do you kill it? He just dissappears when i shoot him, it has happend twice :( 
---
Never had that problem with the queen (xbox), but, you could go around the map, look opp low levels camps and build something nice for them :)
---
Or you could go hunting for high level "clocking" assultatrons, and that other robot with the 3 legs, dont remember its name, they are always fun, even at high lv's as us :)
---
im playing mostly in the afternoon like 3-7 pm and after the dinner 9-11 pm, just now because im without a work 
---
I think I did my math wrong on some of that now, but Assassins is cumulative, so it’s a flat 40 (8%x5)
---
Nah I have tried shooting in every different way, splash damage doesn't kill either.
---
I had the exact same thing only in reverse... none of the ghouls was legendary the only thing I‘ve encountered was a legendary deathclaw but no legendary ary ghouls whatsoever. 
---
found 2 yesterday in totally random boxes...
---
For a game that's been out for 3 months that level 200 is reasonable and not even difficult.
---
Lol this is such a fucking joke. Here we are 3 months out of launch and duping is still an absurd issue. 
---
Yongyea is in the business of clickbait.
---
Also saw them at Camden Park.
---
It's nice to know that they're still showing up. 
---
I find boiled and purified all over the map so much so it's ridiculous. I also have 2 water purifiers at home making me 4 more each time and I think they sell for 5 each. As for adhesive and I looked in my stash last night and found I had 151 LOL - early days was always looking for the stuff and now I know to look for it I find it everywhere. 
---
Yes but I do think it should be on a private server Incase some don’t like it
---
Because the multiplayer part was added just so they could get away with not writing a story or quests?
---
Because they sell you content that was already in the game at ridiculous prices?
---
Because they have a "dev room" with completed items (not *placeholders*, like the Destiny devs got away saying) that can brought into the main game?
---
Because peel back the useless looting, and all you get is a subpar FPS?
---
"LOL it's got survival stuff tho". So did New Vegas, so did 4, and 3 can be modded.
---
*But I enjoy it thooo* So did everybody playing Destiny, except Destiny's gameplay loop was fun.
---
Sounds great to me. Maybe a little hardcore for the typical 76 player though. Well, the losing stuff when you die part anyway.
---
Good job
---
**That's exciting! Really hope we get some Zetan quests.**   
---
^^Maybe ^^this ^^is ^^also ^^a ^^good ^^time ^^to ^^clamor ^^for ^^a ^^Flatwoods ^^Monster ^^flair ^^on ^^this ^^subreddit... ^^Like ^^wtf! ^^Also ^^there ^^are ^^no ^^Deathclaws... ^^Arguably ^^Fallout's ^^most ^^iconic ^^creature! 
---
Does make for a much different number from that 4K though... 700ish.
---
I wonder how many of these are on Tidal. The score album is on there as well as a "songs featured in Fallout 76" which has a decent amount of jukebox songs and also the atom shop theme.
---
Screw that, they can pay the 20 caps... that is 5 minutes of looting.
---
OH!  I saw a behemoth in ...  a pond somewhere..  maybe Solomon's Pond?  Pretty sure it was middle of the map.
---
So what's the story? Find out what happened to the overseer? Find her holotapes and listen to them? Give me a break... That's not a "story", that's a quest objective. It's a device to get you to move to the next location on the map. You can't seriously call that a "story"... The "story" in Fallout 76 is paper thin. Also, in order to have a story you also need to have characters. And the game has none.
---
The game has LORE. You learn about stuff by listening to holotapes, the same way you did by reading terminals in the previous games. But that's not *story*.
---
Exposition is generally considered bad story telling. In movies there is a saying: "show, don't tell". Instead of having some guy talking about something that happened, you should show it to the audience. In Fallout 76's context, the player should be able to PLAY IT. Not listen to a holotape about it. That's not story.
---
Is that a pose you have? Which one?
---
Pretty similar to my [hobo with a shotgun](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c46659e&amp;d=sd0sc1sf2su1so0sw1sp0pq1es1ej3c72cu1ib2ic1as2a00au0a41lr1l11lv2lu2lk1l71aa1p01&amp;w=&amp;n=Hobo%20with%20a%20shotgun) 
---
I focused more on criticals, this guy is beastly. I use adrenal reaction, eagle eye, and speed demon with it.
---
How many were good? 2? I think it was the Dec 4th patch that fixed it for me but I used to get this many pretty much every time.
---
I don't mind the current drop rate but I wish they'd drop the appropriate star level items
---
Thats also happened to me tho. 
---
I'd love to get some calibrated shocks on my t45, with the blackbird paint I think it's my favorite set.  If you can add me (or message me your username and I'll add you) I would certainly take advantage of your offer.  
---
Or maybe a subtle nudge on using search before you post.
---
It just wasn't leaving me alone, it was teleporting but around me. My only choice was to kill it 
---
I got booted to desktop 7 times yesterday.  I still love the game.   /shrug
---
Uh, do you mean a Fog crawler?
---
Got my at Welch Station yesterday after 3 hops
---
Otherwise cav would be hands down the best :D 
---
I've taken one character (stealth sniper) above 100 and another (2h+shotgun) to 55.  Played mostly solo, but quite a bit with RL friends, and once or twice with random parties.  I've done most of the things in the game (including taking+defending almost every workshop, all quests, a good chunk of the events, etc.) at least once, but nothing "grindy" (i.e. I have launched one nuke, not server-hopped for anything other than Evan, etc.)  
---
I have enjoyed most of that, even doing the quests twice.  There are definitely bugs; fewer now than before, but still problems.  Necessary improvements to be made, too, at least IMHO.  But I'm still having way more fun than not.  Still looking forward to what I'm going to do the next time I play.
---
I went by the school multiple times and it never triggered.  Unless you have to be "inside" the building to make it trigger?
---
Nobody cares about youtube except people who use YouTube 
---
Its not a mandatory part of the internet and its very easy to ignore. You're just promoting them with your "criticism". Stop watching it. Sends a stronger message than word of mouth Reddit promotion 
---
Then why do act like a 5 year old? Jesus Christ dude grow the fuck up.
---
Cavalier is better if you’re already in a fight. Sentinel is better if someone is about to retaliate. I swap between both my sets based on what’s happening and the area I’m in 
---
That was a part of the PC patch last week, so expect that to be patched.
---
Alright so i had 2 encounters.
---
The first was a mister gutsie with 5/6 cats in a row formation following him while he was playing a flute.
---
Location: road 81 between billing homestead and ohio river adventures.
---
The second was like 2 days ago this time the mr gutsy name was Vetenarian and he had like 3 stray cats behind him while he was saying "we are allmost there little ones."
---
Location: road 88 little little north of the 88 sign on the map. Start following the road up north untill you see a junk pile on the left side. That is where my camp is and he was walking on the road.
---
Hope it helps but i dont think its bound to one specific route.
---
Goodluck
---
Hmm, all valid points.  I will try it and see.
---
Like him? https://youtu.be/eRvfxWRi6qQ
---
King Fan Man posted a video in which he said he was convinced the FWM were zetans not too long ago.  Nice to see have the images providing additional evidence.  Good work getting/posting those!
---
You mean Tangara Town?
---
You received it being on that level or it’s upgradable too?
---
I'm not sure if I should expose their ID. I have screenshots and video.
---
It probably was killed my another player on its way
---
No need to feel sorry for Bethesda, they sold people a $60 AAA game that in reality was an unfinished early access title.  
---
Feel sorry for the people who paid $60 for this on release.  
---
[Disclaimer] I paid $60 on release, I enjoy the game but I'm not blind to the fact that Bethesda screwed over its customers.
---
Well you can play right?  It would be worse if you wouldnt be able to play it at all. 
---
Hey, we're neighbors!
---
Don’t do that just more people would add to buy or trade 
---
It's broken and buggy and disconnects you all the time. 
---
A lot of games have this kind of space in them, because sometimes the devs need to go into the real game and test things. 
---
The people who do these things are people that will do them no matter what. They work at finding ways. And with computers, there's always a way. 
---
I spend most of my time in game leveling up one build after another to 100, testing it out, pimping it, and then setting it aside for another :-p  I really hope energy weapons get some love in the near future.  
---
Well it keeps resetting progress so not really
---
I take over work shops then hide with invisiblity then snipe people who come to pvp, made alot of enemies that way.    
---
Sorta funny to do. I make the workshop hard to get to wherr just a clean shot is lined up from my snipers nest.
---
Tanagra Town (or however you spell it, forgot) in the mire is where I found my first megasloth
---
I'm on PC and yes it did. Starngely, before the patch, I showed nothing in stored. After the patch, there it was, along with some added crops. Scrapped it all and it hasn't come back.
---
I leave em in garbage bins
---
It probably will be depending on who has gone there. I used to go back at 30 and usually there would be high level mobs there. 
---
Try Camden park &amp; Welch. I got lucky finding my first 2 there. I just saw one on Harper's Ferry vendor last night, but that was the first time I have seen that.
---
I purchased it  was well worth every cap just Do-it 
---
I’ve killed a lot in the game
---
but not **ONCE** have I ever seen a Flatwoods monster
---
just report them on bethesda.net
---
Any way the wind blows...
---
Would be cool if the scorched just stopped spawning for a few hours
---
Just another point in the "SEALS are weird" column.
---
I kept only 1 item. I think a vanguard's shadowed something. 
---
Never knew griefing dupers would be the end game content Bethesda had in mind for us. :D
---
That bunker buster is super heavy and so is its ammo. 
---
Well, you could...i know, it sounds weird now that i see it myself, but you could...
---
Not pick it up
---
Yeah I was gonna do that i wasmt just gonna take an, I have so many fusion cores so u know 
---
Nice. Dam thing I taking up 10 percent of my camp budget and until now I have been stuck with it. Thanks for the input.
---
I went to the cliffs over the bog, the view was spectacular, but the photos I took did not count.  It was an epic walk and I lost heart after that, so I took more pictures of the bog, it truly is gorgeous, and forgot about the challenge.
---
No witch hunting 
---
Some dickheads did just that to me last night. Happened by the Red Rocket Mega Stop just as a Defend the Workshop event kicked off; apparently, while fighting off hordes of those shitty little liberator bots, I tagged one of the derelict vehicles and caught a bounty. When the workshop owner and his buddies showed up, one of them took advantage of my low health and one-shot me, then one of the other ones grabbed all my loot. I was just finishing up a run for gears and plastic and the shithead wiped out over an hour's worth of scavenging.
---
I knew that there was a tinker's bench there that I was going to use to scrap the junk and try to get under my weight limit.
---
Crazy how random stuff can be.
---
Tried it with fallout 4 wasn't really worth it, never is. Just splits dev time away from the main game.
---
i once found some good shit in a blue suitcase in one of the stations (forgot which) it was probably you so thanks !
---
Watoga high school is fantastic for plastic
---
call the bully hunters
---
Thank you everyone! I’ll update when I find it/where. 
---
When are tnhappens to me on Xbox I usually have to do a full system reset 
---
There's plenty of other people telling you the exact same thing.  There just getting down voted by all of the self-righteous cheaters who don't like being called cheaters.
---
Yes, but if cav generated resists on just a bit of movement/strafing, it would be the best. That's my point.    
---
As staying still in 'most' PVP combat situations where you are taking fire is generally unwise. Movement itself is a good damage mitigater. 
---
This is kind of what I do. Log in, see if theres a high level event in the cranberry bog, if not, I jump to a few locations and see if theres some highlevel stuff to blow up.. run through watoga and check the 2 vendors for a power armor plan aside from motion assist servos then maybe do monster mash.
---
I saw where someone nuked Morgantown and from their post it appeared to be decent action there.
---
Anyone else getting sick of these posts? They are adding nothing to this sub. 
---
The better question is what took you and your friend so long to pick up the game?
---
If your on a console there are mad duper’s trying to get their last fix in before the update fixes the problem which is causing servers to be secretly impacted 
---
Are these mods re-usable?  Reason for asking is I have the extra blade on 1 gauntlet and found another legendary gauntlet but the mod no longer appears and no I didn't delete or scrap it accidently, it just seems like it's a one-shot deal only but not sure.
---
Im on pc so not sure if itll work, but yeah ill give that a shot. already tried restarting the game a lot, and my internet, but forgot about just restarting pc lol.
---
It does. Sometimes you can predict it like when you and your team mate are alone and you die and someone took your junk.
---
First time I "saw" one of these was when a friend and I claimed a workshop and had to defend against 2 scorchbeast. Kept occasionally getting hit by these purple beams. It was super far away so couldn't get a good look at it. Wasn't even something we had to kill. Why were you messing with us ;-;
---
*affect 
---
Only if it packed because it was occupied. Only sure fire way to repair all for no junk cost is to move your CAMP,  but then you gotta place everything back down
---
I had it too before, i just kept disconnecting after 10 seconds, i think its the servers issue. After like 15 min everything was normal again. 
---
I have a ton of Supply Requisitions, so I regularly drop them around Flatwoods to help the new players.
---
This changes kind of ruins the whole gift giving thing that I enjoyed so much.
---
&gt; Incisor is 75% penetration. How would 25% more not “do anything extra”?
---
The game may (probably does) have a maximum % of armor reduction.  Once you hit that %, any reduction beyond that is ignored.
---
Lever action plans are usually on responder vendors. 
---
Do you have the perk that makes your mutations stronger? 
---
I dont even get into a server though, i dont even get to a load screen
---
I seriously doubt it. I once showed her my absolutely brilliant camp in Fallout 4, one that I knew would appeal to her sense of aesthetics. All I got was the "that's nice dear" line.
---
I think she was put off by the presence of Curie in my camp. Been downhill with the Fallouts ever since.
---
It doesn’t go up to the rooftop!
---
ive got ammosmith2 and super duper3, ive never had more than 1000 rounds of anything from crafting.  i use at least 6 different ammo types so thats probably related. i generally take grafton steel yard for the steel as im never low on lead and gunpowder, is that so much less efficient than fort defiance farming?  i feel like im missing something here, i would def assume anyone with 9k rounds either bought them from other players or duped them or something like that.
---
And then he ordered all the barrels to point at sparrows.
---
Me at 10:01pm: ill go to bed at 11. 
---
Me at 11:01pm: oh shit, I missed 11. Ill go to bed at 12
---
aight peace out

---
Think you gotta throw an /s after this to prevent down votes lol
---
Hey, at least they have no downsides, and they look cool
---
Edit:Thanks for the answers guys.Much appreciated!
---
Hmm then bethesda hates you 
---
just no one keep to yourself and dont mess with low levels now because they are sometimes bait to where people ambush you when you go near them 
---
It works the same with all of them. Irrelevant comment 
---
What console are you I can help you thru the game 
---
Thanks I don’t use Twitter 
---
The reviewers basically condemned it. 
---
Turns out to be a circle jerk by hipster gamers. I’m pissed off I only just got it. 
---
You can find normal ones in the marsh 
---
Most likely its referring to the secret room.
---
There is a lovecraftian monster in the secret room.  The entrance to the tunnel is through a wall of vines off the tunnel that leads to the chalkboard room.
---
PC dude 
---
Don't worry, I haven't found one either. I'm surprised I haven't because I'm level 65.
---
The main difference is that if you use the Pro you get paid for playing.
---
I mean, that's what Pro means, right?
---
When am I getting my cheque guys?
---
Hello?
---
Thats a Fog Crawler, its not a boss, its a mutated shrimp 
---
Sure why not, thanks doc
---
also it good to note that its not low level and you can apparently find a dev room i though they didnt have one in this one  
---
It's not that long. Honestly 3/4 of the assets already exist.
---
Except for the online features that takes some time depending of the adaptations, I'm pretty sure that this game could have been made by 20 (organised) full time modders on a 1 year run.
---
Fallout New Vegas is different. There is a huge work on the dialogues, quests and the world is totally rebuild, I'm not sure I saw a building of fo3 in NV. Except for vaults design ? Doing a coherent multiple faction, choice and outcome story is a huge task. Especially of that quality.
---
Creating the base game is what takes time. Fallout 76 got amlot of content but since they got a solid base game and some serious creating tools, it isn't a huge task for a studio of that size.
---
For real, you can pay 50$ to play games or talk with him for 1 hour per month on his patreon. That guy thinks way too highly of himself.
---
Tons of materials, like how many?  I have shitloads of legit mats at times, if a high level was storing on a mule he would legit have a lot of mats.  
---
Why? They always said other player would be the ultimate challenge in the game. 
---
Thanks for all the tips guys, looks like I'm going workshop hunting tonight.
---
assets already exist.
---
It does not.
---
i'm sorry, do you see yourself as a critic? Are you sharing your experiences and educated opinions to people who choose to listen to them? No, you are literally following people around, forcing your uneducated opinion on them and telling them they are wrong for enjoying something that you have zero first hand knowledge about. That's not called a critic, that's called a troll. 
---
Wife and I have logged 150 hours on the game. We have builds that compliment each other so it is easy to duo.
---
Thank you! 😍
---
It's not just dupers, this game actually does have a real shallow item pool. Even without duping so everyone has the very best weapons everyone would still have the same few weapons. There just isn't a lot viable. 
---
Sharing Card issue
---
When sharing cards they unshare themselves after a few seconds. This happens wirth the Incisor card for me at level 3 - I see it shared , as do my friends when they look at my name on their screen - the little card is there but then disappears. 
---
I have 8 Charisma but have Magnetic Personality card which puts me at 10 Charisma.
---
This bug was introduced with the latest patch and is there 100% of the time for this card at least, if not all.
---
I had the same experience on my PS4 last night - multiple DC's, waaaaaay more than I have ever experienced, and returning in completely different spots with a loss of waypoints.
---
yes they do but i thought they would be a must have for a melee build,but you dont need them at all for a melee character.
---
I have just a sliver of hope in humanity that they would know. If not, I deserve the down votes lol
---
Is take some 10mm if you have it 
---
The other guy posted a good link. In case you didn't read it, or missed it, I think the important thing is:
---
&gt; Sell an item worth 1 cap to fix the vendor not showing correct cap amount.
---
If I open the menu, sometimes they show 0 caps, sometimes some other number. And sometimes this happens when I trade the 2nd time (i.e. open trade, say 'shit, forgot to equip hard bargain', swap perk, open trade again). So yeah, every 20 hours, the faction will reset back to 200.
---
Saw the same thing happen in the cash register at the Charlestown train station, what a pleasant suprise!
---
People went into it wanting to hate it.
---
The minute it was announced it was getting ripped on because people wanted a new main entry. It’s online only, it lacks NPCs. The world is ‘big and empty’,  it’s buggy.
---
I find the lack of NPCs to be a non issue and I enjoy the way stories are told.
---
The world is huge, yes, but there’s also a lot of substance to it.
---
People just wanted to hate it, critics included, it never stood a chance.
---
Going in I honestly didn’t expect it have a score half as high as it currently does on Metacritic. It’s sheeps and people with unrealistic expectations and they think hating it so much will hopefully kill the game which won’t do them any good as from a business standpoint if the game flops Bethesda will view it as the Fallout IP being the main problem and we won’t ever get another.
---
People need to chill tf our and stop spouting crap about the game, half the people o see hating on it massively haven’t even played the damn game.
---
I also enjoy it’; bugs are annoying, stability is awful and some enemies are too spongy and Scorchbeasts are just awful design in general. But I still love it.
---
I assume so too, but the question remains: how will the guards at whitespring react to it?
---
Electrical Charge also Stun the enemie for a few seconds so he cannot move 
---
I use them on my melee character, when the electricity/radiation explodes it actually staggers enemies and knocks them back a little
---
Damn, thanks for the heads up! I was considering both of them since they seemed cool, but not sure if it scales with percentages or only deal a set amount of damage
---
Well he did not do his job very well, did he?
---
I usually just server hop rather than spend the resources (ammo) of dealing with them. I have most of the map explored so the hop puts me generally near where I was anyway. Only thing I lose is the 20 seconds of load time.
---
If you have passive mode on I think they wont kill it
---
I found it for the first time the other night an seen it again not long after, twice in one night.
---
I can't even imagine the pathetic people that are hiding behind their screens and try everything to dupe in a game, even going as far as to willingly crash a server. How low can you sink lol.
---
Yep yep. I just identify the giant tree as being a serperate structure I guess? The little houses don't have much on the ground by it and the only time I visited it was at night so I couldn't see very well. 
---
&gt; Fog Crawler
---
You can find some in Welch. I stumbled across a ton of them at level 30ish while working on the Overseer's personal journals. I survived, but I had to do some serious kiting and it took a LOT of ammo. 
---
Me and my wife play. We're very casual though. Like only level 16 and had the game on release.
---
Everyone who shoots a level 5 in the head thinks they are a hero now.  Dupers must be cracking up and people thinking they caught dupers in plain site at overseers camps and train stations are desperate for a win on this, and have a 50/50 chance of being right, therefore a 50/50 chance of fucking someones day and stealing all the mats someone gave them to build.
---
You on pc?
---
First dlc is coming at the end of the month roughly since bethesda stated it in their last "inside the vault" stating that when the next patch comes out the dlc will follow very close behind other than that we dont know
---
Got mine at Welch yesterday too. 
---
Reddit like most social media platforms have their contingent of habitual down voters, it is annoying as it hampers discussion through hiding posts. Nothing to be done about it I guess.
---
yes i would not waste caps.Not worth it unless you like sparks.
---
Maybe not to you but it is for a lot of people that may not have a pc as fast as yours or simply aren't as lenient as you are.
---
IMO several disconnects after only 2 days is already too much and unnaceptable for an AAA online game.
---
Also 2 days isn't enough to judge a game and condemn the opinion of reviewers / disgruntled customers, I'd be curious to hear your opinion once you have dabbled into end game.
---
It's cool that you're enjoying it though, no harm in that but no need to "feel sorry" for Bethesda
---
I've been wondering the same thing, it's pretty crazy at the size of the monster, it's humanoid and the tentacles move once in a while so maybe a buffout shot could awaken it.
---
When the dice roll right, 5 stimpacks at once. 
---
Never had anything like this but I had a 120 get pissed that I launched my nuke. They only helped in the part where you guard the robots. I did the rest and launched it.
---
You never did any mod do you ?
---
Sure Fallout 76 got some work but I wouldn't cite trees and ground as things that takes some time.
---
Your welcome! I’m glad to hear it worked.  Hopefully this post will get a few upvotes so people will see it. 
---
I see! Thanks
---
We get 3 caps, gun powder, 5.56 or shotty ammo and a weapon to scrap from super mutants. They offer the best reward for resources consumed!!
---
Keep telling yourself that
---
I just tried moving a few statues that I have on top of world objects like stones, trees, etc. to remove them, but my budget stayed the same.
---
First off, most people who live in WV don’t live in log cabins 
---
Is there no mention of a bigger plan? Not just content but what days they'd like to do patches or other things? 
---
Lucky.. Mine just says " I don't care.. The laundry is done right?"
---
most items are above 3000 - 4000. I have video.
---
I noticed vendors don't buy it. I don't know if they ever did, but they don't now!
---
I've had to repeat the raider quest 3 times (retrieve almost all the raider keys again) because of this shit. As if listening to Rose once was a headache already. Glad their was a beta period to fix bugs like this. There's been so many bugs that I've run into that just make me stop playing and hope they fix it in the future. This will be the last Bethesda game I'll be buying for a while. This whole game is just a $60 shit show. 
---
Fair point, guess they got the mg42 working. Now explain the alien blaster, the laser, and the abundence of plasma rifles. 
---
Not to mention pre war had better production abilities while we can craft pretty much all the wepons with some garbage we found in a rubble pile. 
---
My guess it's just game logic.
---
Well, what did you expect? It's a city populated by Robots. And buildings are immune to nuke changes (so no billions of Glowing Ones in the High School)
---
i like sparks and have the caps, so what the hell I’ll do it
---
Is the damage on the player bad with class freak?
---
Well you lose all your caps for everything. I played for a couple hours last night and I had a ton of junk and other loot to sell or deposit into my stash. A guy with a bounty comes along my path as I approach whitespring to sell stuff. I shoot him but he kills me before I kill him. I got all my caps taken away even though he has a bounty on him AND I lose all that junk. I was basically defenseless trying to ward this asshole off and I lost all my caps simply defending myself as well as all my junk. I am fucking done with this crap unless one of the two people I play with wants me to join. Given long enough that they don't wanna play I'll delete this trash game.
---
FO76 is about choosing a build and sticking with it for a while. So decide what weapon build you want to work for that makes sense with your current SPECIAL spread, and dump all the guns that don’t relate to it. 
---
Also Bunker Buster has a unique Legendary effect, but... as best as I can tell, it’s messed up. In FO4, missiles had an impact damage (like... the actual missile slamming into something) and then an explosive damage (the actual explosion). And the Impact damage was pretty low. Well, the 20% damage on Bunker Buster, as far as I can tell, only boosts the impact damage. There’s a 1pt damage difference between Bunker Buster and a non-legendary ML.
---
I've burned through 15 fusion cores and repaired it like 8 times, that was my first day with it. It's incredibly inefficient, but a ton of fun.
---
Well, I was speaking for myself : )
---
This is one of those moments where you really wish someone had video of what happened. Not because I don't believe you, but because that most have been hilarious. 
---
Damn. I thought I was the only person who knew of the cat dish house (I call it cat lady's house).
---
I think once they get the game stable then they might make more dlc and its mainly Tuesday/thursday I think for when they like to update
---
I have just over 150 that I was going to unleash with friends, but apparently there's no reason anymore
---
That or they are some good ass grape menstats lol.
---
Then what about all the unique buildings that not imported from 4? Again, a map 4 times the size time and three years sounds about right.
---

Crap.. I need to find 1 point in Perception I guess.
---
I wear the brotherhood science scribe outfit with the matching helm looks good paired with a surgical mask full body coverage looking like a science ninja.
---
Yeah I saw the briefcase, i thought i was in for a waad of that sweet pre-war cash.
---
My theory is that it was a zetan that crash landed and was injured, it looks like he stole some mr gutsy parts and made himself a hovering suit as an alien wheelchair and used the mask to scare off anyone who would try to find or attack him.
---
Nah, I walk up and see someone taking my stuff their heads getting blown off. Low levels gotta learn not to fuck with peoples stuff. Teach em.early and they might not be so interested in pvp.
---
PC Platform: I cancelled after playing BETA and waited. I picked it up this year and loved it until recent patch. The issue is the stability of servers. From what i understand the duping or whatever is going on causes the servers to bounce. Since the patch there is a new issue where the servers rollback, so if you are doing a quest and haven't finished GUESS WHAT - you start over again if you haven't made it to a save point. Pre-patch I dealt with 2 reboots, after, i'm in the 20's.
---
Join me and my boys mate. You on PC? 
---
Aside from cosmetics, the actual legendary effects of armor wouldn’t be in there. There’s too many combinations for them to have every possible combination on every possible piece of armor. So him saying his armor was from there probably was only his visible cosmetics. 
---
That being said anyone knowingly accessing or otherwise benefitting from the Dev room is a piece of shit.
---
Hoard springs. Keep a supply of gears, but don't hoard them.
---
I'm 70 % of the way too platinum.
---
now that sounds like fun
---
I didn’t even have my set of Raider PA (below rank 18 or so) when I saw my first grafton monster.. a lot easier than expected
---
understandable. My argument is fo4 wasn't online and opening your pipboy 'paused' the game. Additionally, when you weren't playing, the world was frozen. More more so, it'd possibly be another source of income for Bethesda, giving them incentive to try something.
---
I’m a dad of 3.  I get a couple hours at night.  Got to do your RL work first!!  Games are the reward.  
---
That's why you ALWAYS carry multiple cards
---
Morgantown is pretty good. There's alot of Glowing Ones, but unfortunately barely any Legendaries. If you want to purely farm Glowing Ones and don't give a shit about Legendaries, then I recommend Morgantown

Huh, I've actually never noticed, some input would be cool on this. 
---
The one on the left looks an awful lot like a "nuclear football", or the briefcase the president carries with him that can initiate a nuclear strike. They use the term "touchdown" to reference a nuke strike so they use the terminology. 
---
Use it when figuring queen, able to use that an ninjas to hit 3x the amount on every swing 
---
I will upvote you for the comedy just to hopefully counteract one downvote lol
---
nope not not at all.
---
probably some russian key site
---
The theory of your method seems sound enough, but I wouldn't automatically assume it's duping and not a new issue introduced that's causing the server instability. 
---
From the duping perspective, you're relying on a reliable server-wide crash bug that can be triggered with two accounts, and knowing the timing of autosave intervals. 
---
you are too optimistic lol.... 
---
humanity, humanity never changes
---
It's so damn messed up that I don't know what to feel about that, seriously.
---
I disconnected
---
PC.
---
That's bad :/
---
Even if this fix worked for me i am pretty sure i would not end up at 0% if i scraped everything, it still feels like something is wrong.
---
Problem is that Bethesda will not look at this at all before it hits youtube or any other big media...
---
Soo, that is why i never submit tickets, did it once on some other bug, no help from them at all, and 7 days before they even replied :/
---
It would be cool if The vault tec one would be part of a mission to get a remote nuke detonator or something. Maybe find a serperate code to punch in. Idk pipe dreams honestly. 
---
This is a gaming sub, nobody uses the search function. 
---
I waited like a few mins and disconnected
---
I hope they can fix whatever the Disconnect/Rollback issue is. I had a rollback happen right after getting a rare plan, and even crafting the item. I hadn't known about this issue and I assumed previously if the server let me craft something, it was in sync with my character however, I disconnected and when I rejoined, I was pre-fast travel to my base and apparently never purchased the item.
---
For most of the weapons I would only assume it’s because Bethesda wanted to both reuse assets and needed more guns.
---
Can you tag all of them plus prime with just three nukes? My understanding is the reload time on the silos makes it impossible to have more than three zones active at a time. Unless they stay sealed after the nuke wears off, you've got three shots to do it all in I think. I'm still working towards nuke access so I don't have all the info and might be wrong.
---
Best fix I've heard is to uninstall the most recent patch. It's cancer. 
---
The only problem, given that theory, is that if these individuals have essentially been given free reign to be raiders, who can stop them?  They were able to get their hands on ridiculously powerful weaponry early on and level up to where a nuke to the face would probably only leave a scratch on their health.
---
Personally, I find raiders disgusting.  When Nuka World rolled out for Fallout 4, I completely rejected the idea of doing any of the raider quests and focused on wiping them off the map.  We need heroes to police these types and sadly, I don’t think it’s possible (they have too much of a head start).
---
At this point, Bethesda needs to make a hard call on these sorts of individuals or they will destroy any sort of long term interest in the game and their precious atom shop.  As much as I would be disappointed to have to start over, if Bethesda really wants to make realistic use of PVP and keep this going for years (less than two months in and I’m getting close to being “done”), they need to wipe the slate clean and start over.  Otherwise, dupers and raiders (wear whatever you want...your behavior dictates what you are), will rule...and ruin...this online experience.
---
Farming any area with super mutants or mole miners will yield 500+ steel in less than 30 minutes due to scrapping their loot. Plus there are tons of places that have tin can traps that give a ton of steel as well. Workshops are probably the least efficient way to get the common materials like steel or lead. 
---
It's pretty easy to make 10k rounds in a few hours if you know where to farm which is what a lot of these witch hunters don't understand 
---
Not true about the buildings BTW.
---
I entered the medical center to kill the legendary in there and everything inside was Glowing Ghoul and was a legendary glowing ghoul at the spot.

Is this what's going on? All of my weapons are broken, and I don't have the materials to fix them. Last three times I've played I've been disconnected after claiming the workshops I need for my materials (not an easy feat with broken weapons). And of course, when I try get back into the game, I don't own the workshops any more.
---
You can set to team or area so entirely upto you. 
---
Tanagra Town. It's a reference to [Darmok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darmok) from Star Trek.
---
It is very awesome. I have not figured out anything ingame about it beyond it being really cool.
---
I've found it twice, seen it for the first time the other night an seen it again not long after, i screenshotted both of course, you dont actually get anythkng special of it though which is a shame seeing  as its so rare.
---
One spawns fairly often for me at the workbench between the saboteurs shed and time travel tower, whatever that little town is called. I was level 90 when I first started going there regularly, though.
---
&gt;but is the duping the main reason for instability?
---
Pretty much, yeah. 
---
hey vault dwelling boss babes! I've got this hot new essential oil that'll cure your anti-vaxx kid of the scorch! if you want to make thousands of caps from your C.A.M.P as your own boss just message me now!

Also, little Braiden got lost in the mire with a deadly case of flap limb, so if any of you boss babes see him please bring him back to my C.A.M.P at the border of the Divide, Mire and Cranberry Bog.
---
I found one going left of vault 76 check there but i have nkticed that disease cures are rare but i somehow found 2 or 4
---
Question is, why would I need that buff? It is not like there is hard monster out there or anything that would make me want to require that buff. Thing aren't challenging in this game and when they aren't, I don't need buff. Don't get me wrong, I would do that event, but not for buff. I would just do that because there is no PVP and nothing else to do, so maybe it would give some sort of entertainment. And the thing is, with current design, server hopping is heavy thing. Not only do you server hop for vendors, but you also server hop for queens and trades, now that makes servers more temporary thing and would you wanna invest into taking zones, when you know you might server hop in next five minutes. 
---
I just checked the video again. should add one more 0.

Bro chill lmao.

I killed a Mole rat Thursday that had 33 meat, 12 hides, &amp; 7 sets of teeth, and another that I got over 50 .556 ammo from. 
---
Ditto. I had just logged on and started my start of session IM and selling. There was a hard drop with none of the usual twitchyness that indicates a server or connection is going bad then I dropped. When I came back, everything I had sold like a minute prior (in game time) was back in my inventory.  
---
thanks, this will save me so much time, i literally spend the last 3 days grinding steel at grafton steel yard and felt like i was barely gaining ammo compared to what i would use each day
---
Lead + steel?  Who would ever want those two resources together??
---
I have rank 3 *batteries included* and rank 2 *Power User* and have 81 cores...I only use PA, no electronic weapons.

I need a Fusion Core hoarding support group. I just can't stop myself.
---
What are the two perks under, science? What lvl are they, I’m only 46 and I’m not seeing them
---
I wouldn't worry about it. If someone did that to me and asked if I lost it, I would say keep it. Gotta be friendly. If I really need parts I would ask for the screws, springs, etc.
---
&gt; They removed the story
---
Wrong. It has story. It's not "as good" as in NV/3, but it still has. You dislike it. That's subjetive. I honestly like it more than NV/3. And hell of course I like it more than 4. Not more than Far Harbor though.
---
&gt; the characters 
---
At this point I don't think you've played 76 at all.
---
&gt; the dialogue 
---
Yeah. It was partially removed on Fallou 4. Completely removed on Fallout 76. It's awful you can't refuse a quest from a god damn robot.
---
&gt; the skill system 
---
Every game has a different "progression" system. Nothing removed, just changed.
---
&gt; and even the post-apocalyptic setting 
---
The what.
---
&gt; which was previously a mini-game in Fallout 4 
---
Spent more time on Base Building in 4 than playing.
---
Those thing were the CORE for YOU. For me, it was always about exploration and immersion. This is the most immersive exploration experience that I've ever had in all Fallout games. Even with players with mics.
---
So, I get it. You dislike it. But don't lie.
---
I’ll probably buy it soon then, who doesn’t love sparks!?
---
Yes, six different creatures. I just went back to Vault 76 and walked to Flatwoods. I killed a tick, molerat, opossum, mongrel, scorched, radroach, and ghoul, and then the quest said to return to the forge. 
---
If someone stole from you, I'd imagine you be a bit unhappy. Don't be stupid.
---
I nuked Morgantown, but it wasn't so great. Mostly Super-mutants. Legandary rate seemed low. Top of the world is a respectable alt. nuke site to whitesprings.

Probably a result of the new patch. Lighter bobby pins, 100% less playable.

4. Some of my characters (it seems to be ones that are higher level or perhaps have more items on them?) are getting constant crash to desktop. On my higher level characters, I'll get a CTD every 30 minutes or so, sometimes less. The lower level characters can play for hours without any issues. This was NOT an issue before this last patch. This only started last week.
---
FUCK ATOM. WOOBY GANG RISE UP.
---
One of the things that work great regardless of levels are effects.  I use Enforcer to hobble creatures so the higher levels can easily finish them.  
---
That and generally keeping mobs occupied while the high levels kill the Bosses.
---
It drives me fucking nuts when they have alternate versions. This was the situation with fallout new Vegas playlists too. Thank you for that. 
---
You can buy the .50 cal heavy barrel from a vendor, only costs 50 caps. Of course you can remove the prime
---
Everyone including every enemy type in Fallout 76
---
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking I mean there must be some explanation for the chalkboard and I feel this is the most logical
---
Where did I say I hate the games? I don't even hate the company, they're just greasier than ever.  Your hyperbole demonstrates what goes on in your thoughts when reading others' posts.  Bethesda isn't your girlfriend, stop acting like it.
---
Try going to pleasant valley ski resort. When you first travel there, under the bridge is 3 can traps you can disarm. Also the doorway into the building that has the vendor bot also has 3 traps. Those 6 traps alone yield almost 100 steel. Kill and loot everything then on the left of the building is a weapons bench for you to scrap it all before you leave 
---
Try again. :\
---
I totally picked up on the joke side of that. The disclaimer made it confusing though.
---
Was fighting a scorched who had no weapon in Harper ferry by the vendor. The scorched runs to the vender and suddenly equips a stalkers pool cue. As in, I see the scorched pull the pool cue from no where and start attacking, kill and loot stalkers pool cue(1star). Sold right back to vender
---
thats really cool, thanks for sharing. 
---
Haven't finished reading your entire comment but for the first issue make sure you equip a hazmat suit prior to entering PA and that should help you a little work server latency.
---
You don't want it. PC has been unplayable for me since it hit. I get disconnected every 20 mins or so. Before I could pay for hours without issue.
---
&gt;Alternatively, for an extra 10 bucks, you can just play with your friends on your own server that will never be changed.
---
Or the private servers are included in the $60 when you purchase the game? $60 dollars for a game should include at least all basic features.
---
That's actually really cheap considering the length of most EULA agreements these days. Please PM me the details for your lawyer so I can get in on this deal
---
Seems there’s so many A$$holes out their wanting to grief you if you refuse to trade regardless of the weapon your using, I have a bog standard automatic handmade I use on the glowing mobs at whitesprings during nukes (with glow sight 3 and the commando perks), I’m always getting invites to trade and 99% of the time when I emote a no il get a melee weapon in my face or shot at. I don’t trade because there is nothing I want from these people and I don’t think they’re  going to be interested in the only things I wish to sell, that being, the 8 golf outfits I’m looking to sell to a vendor. I had never thought that these people might be wannabe vigilantes I just assumed they were 10 year olds having tantrums cause they didn’t get their own way lol.
---
I was aware of the monster but I was wondering if this chalkboard was related to the monster, if we could use a syringer and buffout on the monster as it shows on the chalkboard and if it does anything
---
The Responder vendors should have them - Grafton Station, Camden Park and Welch seem to be the most likely places, per the other responses and threads on this. However, it seems to be a low-ish spawn rate, so it can take hours. The going rate on the Market subreddit is around 2,000 caps - about 3X the vendor price - if you have a surplus and you'd like to save time instead. 
---
I needed to repair my shotgun after every two combats before I got this perk.  Now, after 5-6 hours I'm down to half.
---
Ok, I will probably wait to go to Harper's Ferry for a while then. Thanks for the tips
---
They stated before the game was launched that it'd have private servers about a year after release.
---
Yep, just adding to it with more detail for the person you responded to and those downvote ng your valid comment.
---
Same 
---
&gt; frequent saving and synchronization is too high
---
Yes, pretty sure that would introduce even more lag
---
You're a weird fella ain't ya?
---
You realize on a private server your progress would not carry over to the main servers..
---
Not shotguns.. exploding effect should be nerfed, i have lever action that does 660 dmg (also has two shot) but it one shots everyplayer from my experience so pvp is unfair.. let say someone want to fight me and deals dmg to me when i shoot him back he dies instantly #nocounterplay
---
Damn I come across hermit crabs all the time. Lvl 48 and probably killed a dozen 
---
He doesn't mention ps4 or xbox though?
---
They need to improve the whole nuke zone events in general.  Every major and minor city/town/airport whatever needs its own boss.  Mobs need to be drastically changed in nuke zones not just fucking glowing or some bullshit.  
---
That makes me not want to pick this game back up. I took a break for a minute but if shits disappearing, that’s a no for me atm
---
same for horde events. i want to see hord mobs to spawn everywhere in the region until their boss is killed
---
So you were killed in a legitimate way in a game that has PvP? Sounds like you are the one with the problem honestly 
---
You're just mad since you're a duper!
---
Gotta love Reddit hivemind.
---
Yeah I been battle with the I all day.
---
I really don't let it bother me or change how I play.  I know the slow-but-steady route is a lot more rewarding.  Rather than be upset about it, you might say I pity them because they will never know that.

Wasn't clever the first time, gets significantly less so on repeating in same exact thread ...
---
It's nerf or nothing!
---
I actually really want a Nerf gun...just imagine a sticky dart on a super mutants forhead...
---
I get D.C.'s and crashes a lot anyway. Lol. Works gonna rain out, so I was trying to decide on going home and playing fallout or run some errands. Didn't wanna go home if the servers were gonna be down anyway. 
---
I don't think anyone has any hard evidence outside of anecdotal experiences and dupers are a popular scapegoat. From a technical standpoint though, you can probably assume that Fallout 76 is driven heavily by [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) which handle different player interactions, including every time you access any sort of inventory/container. It is conceivable that the load or delay placed on these microservices when attempting to push/pull information for thousands upon thousands of items could affect other users that have to share access to these same services on the server and result in the disconnects. I just haven't seen any evidence that proves that.
---
I thought they were banning dupers to help server stability. They should just hurry with private servers already.
---
Unless you want to just clear them from your inventory/stash for yourself, it would seem so. It really sucks!
---
Ok...WTF is a Wooby?
---
Are you commenting on everyone who replies to this post dude? 
---
Been wondering how this one worked mechanically. So it is just a stand up, crouch down, and go straight to hidden? And if they're looking right at you, you switch to caution?
---
Interesting...Ill deffinately be checking this out
---
It's not made by "can do no wrong" Obsidian, it's not Fallout 5...
---
Now with that out of the way....
---
A lot of the dislike is justifiable due to bugs/glitches that have "ruined" the game forever for some along with some of Beth's questionable decisions post launch, while on the other hand Beth is slowly working to correct issues (the whole bag thing, better communication etc) some will and have decided to give up all together on Beth due to the fact that the issues happened to begin with.  While others (like myself) are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and will keep playing the game and enjoying it despite the issues (my current big issue is just random disconnecting).  
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this is something you can do if or when they introduce some way to make your own faction/guild with friends. 
---
City building.

Brought my girlfriend an xbox one for Christmas. She's currently working her way Fallout 4 but she is super into the idea of us playing 76 together. I can't wait! 
---
Sounds like a good encounter. I've definitely been enjoying helping people out as a higher level. Stepped in to fend off some griefers yesterday and hung out with the two players they were bugging for a while.
---
It can be quite rewarding. I like that you left the perks up the them.
---
It is fun for me because i enjoy just exploring lore and places but in pvp scenario or leveling up its really fking broken two shot explosive handmade does over 300dmg per round with right perks ofc but magazine with 85 rounds its over 25k damage compsred to a players health i am lvl 90 and got about 300hp..
---
Yeah I wish more people we're willing to do that. The best thing about saying Yes is that they never want to stay, but are eager to reward you for having helped. Sit in a chair at the whitespring bunker and you'll get server hoppers up the wazoo trying to unload plans and ammo
---
They were role playing as your personal Fallout 4 companion/Dogmeat.
---
Seems to me the game doesn't stack Perk and Legendary effects when they are the same, or at least I've seen it when you have a weight reduction perk and weapon/armor effect.
---
They're food trucks that sold crab meat =P
---
ain’t that deep fam
---
And C.A.M.P turrets.
---
Watch out with that crafting, we got some kids hopped up on Buffout shooting any high/low level combo crafting.
---
Apparently reddit, because half the users here hate it so much they're on the verge of tossing their computers and going electronics-free out of sheer hatred for fallout76. 
---
cdkeys, allkeys
---
Like I said if you’re already in a fight. (Workshop or after a Wanted person or seeking revenge) Cav is hands down the best. But if you’re stood next to someone provoking them Sentinel is just a meme 
---
Study looks better in my opinion. Heavy is so bulky it completely covers up your under armor.
---
I will not accept requests out of the blue like that. It's a social game to me. And that's not being social, that's using people as if they are just a game mechanic. 
---
All so they can save like, at most 50 some caps of fake money you can get back toot sweet?
---
&gt;I just wanted to find out if there was a reason why my level 55 charicter has not found any good legendary weapons and or armour yet.
---
Because you're level 55. Unless you just get really lucky, you aren't likely to have gotten one, let alone multiple pieces of *great* legendary gear in that time. I didn't get my first explosive weapon until level 100ish. Even then, it's not one of those holy Grail like a two shot explosive or explosive shotgun. It's a stalkers explosive black powder pistol. Neat, for a one shot surprise, but not really useful for an extended fight. Getting to 50 is like the first 10%. Honestly, because of leveled gear, hunting for endgame gear doesn't even start till 50.
---
As for the one shot, I've never heard that, but I one shot most enemies short of scorch beats, deathclaw, lurk Queens. 90% of drops are 1 star. I *have* heard the opposite: that you need to let them do the legendary regen. I haven't noticed that to make any real difference either.
---
God damn this stupid witch hunting shit is getting annoying. 
---
Seriously, I had three instances of this happening while trying to launch my first nuke.  I was so mad I just logged off.  Usually roll with the punches with this game cause I love it but I was beyond infuriated getting to the last bit with the crew chiefs and getting disconnected or rolled back whatever.  I’ve played since launch and this weekend was the absolute most I’ve seen.  
---
sounds like you're just pissed that they didn't post step by step, the method to do it so you could go do it.
---
I love the game, but Bethesda hasn't handled to game as well as they should have. Just because you haven't experienced the bugs yet, doesn't mean they don't exist. With all that being said, the bugs for the most part don't take away the joy of the game and Bethesda is making a lot of good changes and are improving.
---
Had my first encounter with one yesterday.
---
Shot it once and it disappeared.
---
Just like my only encounter with the mothman.
---
Nice Dude! I just made one on Xbox and was going to post it on reddit, until I seen this one. I have a lot more work to do..lol
---
Nioce. Thank you. 
---
I never take reviews into consideration anymore. This game was deemed one of the most disappointing games of 2018 and I don't understand why. I haven't come across any major bug issues, a couple disconnects here and there but that happens in all games. There's always plenty to do in the world. My gameplan changes everytime I get online between exploration, completing some events, maybe take a workshop or two, remodel or move my camp. 
---
Personally, Ark was one of my favorite games of all time but you do eventually run out of things to do. I built empires on different servers, took down every boss, helped the newbies get established, etc. It's a shame but I'll return eventually for another round.
---
Hello again my synth friend psycho, I thought squad maneuvers did not stack with speed demon. I share it to help my non mutie friends keep up. Can anyone confirm this?
---
Actually, he listed off the likely steps of accessing the room, and noted he did not want to go into further detail because he did not want to get in trouble or encourage other players to attempt the cheat.
---
It's also ridicule-worthy, sorry. Their parent company has years of experience with an MMO game, and Todd himself said verbatim that they got help from Zenimax Online in producing 76, so there's honestly no excuse but laziness that more steps weren't taken to avoid problems like duping and accessing dev rooms. 
---
Yong ain't perfect but guys, c'mon ... this really is a bad look for the game.
---
And i did get rewarded now. Kept on going for 2 hours again as i came back from the doc.   
---
First i was to take a break quickly, said though, after i got my hands on a Stealth Boy mod which never showed up too, to get another round.  
---
BANG
---
There was the first calibrated shocks. I were crying now... One more to go.
---
You see there are 2 problems with this post:
---
1. These disconnects were happening right after patch.
---
2. If another duping method did exist tutorials would be all over youtube, which they're not.
---
There's been a mod to fix it for ages.  So, uh, yeah.
---
A lame wannabe god that doesn't hold a photon to the amazing aura of Atom.
---
I know, right? TSE meta is fair and balanced. Hardly broken. Unrelated to dupers. Getting ganged up by full TSE squad is *fair challenge.* I could have outskilled them. 
---
Maybe I should stop playing for fun, pay dupers, get that "Instakill grief combo" items and start killing random people through pacifist reduction. It's legit if it's in the game. Am I right?
---
Well it also could be referring to themselves becoming stronger, thus represented by the monster icon.  (Buffout + syringe) = fun
---
&gt;I heard the opposite (that it had to heal), so I wonder if both rumors are wrong and **it's just random.**
---
This is the best theory.
---
I had a black powder rifle with a bayonet, its a small sword, pretty bitchin.
---
You’ll Probably want a decent amount of Agi, for more action points (and the refresh perk). Also a decent amount in Int; you’re going to be burning cores if you use VATS a lot so the weight reduction and usage extension perks (3/3 each) for cores will probably be important. Luck has some great perks (lots of folks view the mutation perks as mandatory... I don’t. I don’t run Starched Genes 99% of the time, because in PA you basically never take enough rads to get new mutations, and it’s easy enough to swap in Starched Genes when you want to take some Rad-Away in a nuke zone (the rest of the time you can just run... I forget what it’s called but there’s a Endurance perk that regents your rads during daytime). And Class Freak depends on what mutations you are running; I only have a few and their negatives aren’t that big a deal, so I don’t bother with class freak. 
---
I recommend at least 4 in Charisma; if you run solo, Lone Wanderer is just good, and when you group up, it gives you access to a basic mix of good group perks (probably Stranger in Numbers and then whatever other Cha perks make sense)
---
I only run 1-3 Endurance on my characters; the DR on power armor keeps you well protected and PA provides for several things that perk cards might otherwise (adamantium limbs, rad resist...)
---
I do run emergency protocols on my torso, so I’ve got a nice “safety zone” if I start taking unexpected damage. Which combines nicely with the Adrenal Reaction mutation and Nerd Rage perk, if you go deeper into Int
---
depends on your gear for me its screws, fibreglass and black titanium
---
I'm literally asking for proof. End result proof. I dont care about steps. Why dupe and ruin your experience? 
---
Should we make a support group? I have the same addiction :D
---
It's true.  I've probably played this game for over 100 hours and I still have no clue what the "Daily" in daily quests is actually supposed to mean.
---
The people who grind Camden Park in order to get the fursuit costume realized that you get assigned a new Daily every time you jump servers.  There's no plausible way anyone could get the 3,000 Mr. Fuzzy tokens if it were literally based on real-life days.
---
I've been rubber banding when entering the white-springs or bunker since release.  However I seem to be having it more during non-transitions now as well.
---
&gt; so as i'm sure most people know by now when somebody finishes the Scorched Earth event a message pops up and says "The Scorchbeast Queen's reign of terror has ended" (or something similar) yet nothing actually changes when it happens. I think it'd be cool if it did have an effect on the whole world, since it is the entire thing the story is leading us to do. now sure it'd be cool if the second she died every scorch infected thing would simultaneously have their heads explode, but I think a much more plausible change would be for them to become weaker or possibly even have the potential to become hostile to each other as the hive mind effect would likely be lost with the queen taken out.
---
&gt; 
---
What if she sells for Rodan and Fields? The story possibilities are endless.
---
A part of the previous method was to overload the server (integer overflow in crafting station) and force it to rollback. That's how the dupe's occurred. One player bugs the server with the integer overflow, and then waited to be disconnected. But before they DC, they transferred all their stuff to a friend or container. After the Disconnect, the servers would "roll-back" to the point of the error, and the player got  their items back. Along with the items their friend held onto.   
---
It's always revolved around bugging the server, and any new methods discovered would reasonably utilize similar means.
---

I use it to cull extra junk I don't need. It's really helpful! 
---
I haven't seen a moth man yet.
---
He doesn’t need to. He said it’s likely due to a patch. The patch only happened on PC. For it to be patch related and not an exploit, he’s assuming OP is running on PC. In other words, jumping to conclusions while accusing OP of jumping to conclusions.
---
Springs
---
I made a new character when a couple of my friends bought the game and one spawned and disappeared minutes after we left the vault together. 
---
screws,gears,oil for building stuff other than that it depends on your load out
---
Wonder if they made changes from the PC patch, that will go to Console, and PC as well.  Lets hope so, Disconnects and CTD have been rampant for me, and happen almost never before the patch.
---
Ballistic fibre, screws, spring, gears, adhesive, steel, lead, leather, wood are the only real important ones needed to repair weapons and armor or craft mods for them
---
Springs, steel, and adhesive are my holy trinity and I ALWAYS need them and always in short supply because of how much I use them
---
Haha I "was privileged" to do the dmv quest at least 4x and belly of the beast 2x.  I had gotten into the cave and had to go back and do all the beacon checkpoints.
---
I’ve seen that farm way up near the top left of the map nuked before, and I know a lot of ferals spawn in the field near the grain silo to the south of it. Never been there during a Nuke event though so I’m not sure how it goes, but I’m thinking about trying it out this week. 
---
Crashes and disconnects are not affecting everyone just some of the players and console gets patch later so they can fix these issues what occurs on pc (correct me if im wrong) so i can be that console players wont get more crashes
---
I like..probably will implement some of this on my build!
---
Adhesive... all the adhesive you can find...
---
Well... Its like spamming yourself with lots of particles though.  Like the SB attacks.
---
1) PVP balance. I don't PVP and this should be obvious so I'm not going to explain.  
---
2) PVE Endgame balance. Endgame essentially consist of a group of players entering a nuke zone and dropping a bunch of high level mobs. Credit for a kill is assigned if you tag/hit a mob before it dies. This content is balanced around a specific power curve and can be a hectic but fun event. Joe Dupper enters zone and has exploited to God level. He begins one shotting everything. The content is ruined. Legit players can't get hits in fast enough to participate. Rather than getting dozens of kills, drops and a nice pile of XP you are related to whatever scraps you can get from the duper. End game ruined.
---
3) Economy. Monetary and Power. Online games with a community and trading base have fragile power and monetary economies. Duping creates rampant inflation which eventually strands legit players outside both the power and economic curve. This creates a vicious cycle that ends with everyone becoming dupers or the good players deserting.
---
It seems to always go to caution unless you're a suitable distance away. The distance for caution without the perk goes to hidden with it. But, you get a momentary period of 'Caution' even when right in front of something that has noticed you. 
---
Keep in mind I don't know if your agility or sneak helps this. I don't have any sneak perks but pretty high agility. 
---
It depends what you’re running a little bit (ie. power armor vs standard armor) but for the most part I tag the following for search.
---
Aluminum
---
Adhesive
---
Lead
---
Screws 
---
Plastic
---
Once you start building elaborate camps I’d recommend
---
Nuclear material
---
Crystal
---
know what you mean, i'v got a workbench room next to a rest area (cooking stations, music tools, beds, etc) with a small garden out back with free food and water but without signs to put on the front it just looks like an intimidating "player base" even with the "welcome home" sign on the front, shame really i'v happly made soups and stuff for people passing by and they just run thinking i'm getting annoyed :(
---
I've seen a lot of items and places like this that look like they will be interactive. I assume they are either from content that got scrapped or future content that will use them.
---
There's a lot of plastic at Camden park on the ground. Just look those nuka cola cups with straw and the stacks of those cups give you plastic too.
---
And you can get gears from the mole miners armor too
---
No it wasn't, it could be done solo.
---
Oh, wow
---
I didn’t know what to expect but.. thank you!
---
I got mine from g2a for 16€
---
Most recent patch was not stable at the start at all. Literally the day the patched drops there were tons of "Is anyone else getting more disconnects?" post
---
Omfg no one fucking cares 
---
Perforating Ammo magazine mod with a Hunting Rifle takes them.down faitly quick, but you definately need an Anti-Armor for these
---
Yeah I'm not saying we need that exact system, but it's SOMETHING. The mutations system is a really nice start - the recipes are extremely rare and expensive, they use a (somewhat) rare resource to make, and the actual serums themselves are consumable. You can gain and lose mutations so you might have to use one multiple times. We need more things like that. We need some obscenely expensive cosmetic or QoL things to buy with caps. 20k for a gilded weapon skin or something - we already have the gilded minigun, something along those lines. Weapon skins, power armor skins, legendary customization, rare and powerful plans - there is so much potential there, but they are all locked behind atoms or rng grinding
---
Well, once you get to the very top, there is a desk and on that desk spawns a power-fist.   There is also a note in one of the destroyed rooms.
---
&gt;  servers rolled back on me last night, maybe this was why? It was the first time it's ever happened so Idk.
---
The reset is shorter than 24hours, as i've traded at 10pm and then 6pm the next day.   
---
Also the timer starts when you excersize the vendor, it is not a fixed time of day for reset. (unless you consistently vendor at the same time each day.
---
Uh... I think you could scrap or sell all of them, to be honest, haha. While stuff like a Gatling Laser and Grenade Launcher sound really cool, you'll find plenty of them as you play on. They're carried and used (poorly) by super mutants and scorched. I will sometimes use a Grenade Launcher I pick up in the wild, just as a way to save ammo on my main guns, but grenades and rockets in general are less useful than in past Fallout games. I typically use thrown grenades and the Daisycutter - Legendary fat man with 90 percent weight reduction - for the rare situations I want to use explosive weapons, like if there is a close cluster of enemies together. (You get the Daisycutter as a reward for completing one of the Free States' bunker quests.)
---
Beyond the heavy weapon stuff - You'll find or be able to craft plenty of Deathclaw and Mole Miner's gauntlets, so you can sell that. I'm not a fan of the black powder weapons because they take forever to reload. You'll come across thousands of pipe weapons - sell or scrap the ones you have. The Somerset Special isn't bad, but handguns in general are lower powered and less effective at long range vs. hunting and lever action rifles. 
---
Your sniper rifles are good for what you're at in the game, but you only need one of them. You could use the combat shotgun as your close range weapon, but I generally find melee to be better than shotguns. (Some people do really love shotguns though, so your mileage may vary.)
---
have tried similar in the past but most people out of habbit assume its locked and just dont bother trying :(
---
https://pastebin.com/dCU3d2fF
---
I just made this, should be fairly accurate on materials generally needed. Low end you can basically double it if you don’t store anything besides junk and you’ll be at 598/600
---
Can hardly blame him for being aggressive, Appalachia is nowhere near ADA compliant.
---
Nice try, duper.
---
Yes! I used to always have so many I’d sell them off. Now I haven’t found one for several days. Antibiotics too. Also, what’s the difference between antibiotics and disease cure? They seem to do the same thing? 
---
It wasn't a big in Fallout 4.
---
If you don't think nukes are common enough how about you launch them instead of depending on others to launch them
---
You are a true hero, we don't deserve you
---
Lol none of you will ever hold Bethesda accountable will you. Its always something else.
---
Fireproof + dense or padded mod, seems to affect the scorchbeast sonic attack. Maybe your friend is running this.
---
Empathy did seem to make you take more damage than the reduction shown but I have not test after the pc patch. I ditched empath and never looked back.
---
That's why I run around with a bloodied power fist and just falcon punch everything. The game is just too boring when I use my tse guns
---
&gt; Instead of having some guy talking about something that happened, you should show it to the audience
---
Um...the story in every single FO game is like that. You stand in front of an NPC, click dialog options, and there you go. It's literally NPC after NPC telling you the story.
---
&gt;"show, don't tell"
---
Which is exactly how FO76 plays out. You visit all the locations, actively pulling out bits and pieces of the story. Holotapes, terminals, notes, bodies, the environment...all of it starts to connect. But you have to actively engage with the world, not just find the next marked NPC on your map and await the exposition.  
---
And for anyone who's played the series from the beginning, you would understand how the deep lore has always been hidden amongst the ruins, in holotapes, terminals, notes, or environmental story-telling. That's just how the game works. I mean you remember the Brotherhood in FO1, right? How may Brotherhood NPCs did you interact with. I'll wait while you count them.
---
It's a different way of crafting the narrative, and it feels more real than any other FO game, where apparently everything is in stasis until the "Wasteland Hero" shows up to save the day.  
---
I mean, what is it specifically that you didn't get. You didn't get the same "holy shit" moments when you uncovered the fate of the Free States, the Brotherhood, or made all those connections through the Enclave story line?  Were you not able to put the pieces together without an NPC exposition and a nice slide show spoon feeding everything to you?  
---
Honestly, it is a matter of opinion. Some people want an experience that feels open, but is really on rails awaiting the "hero" to do something, all while having everything clearly enunciated by NPCs. Other people are really enjoying the feeling of not being the "chosen one" and exploring a world that (even without NPCs) feels more real and believable, and one that deeply rewards those people who are willing to scratch below the surface.  
---
I believe antibiotics add disease resistance, so you are less likely to acquire new diseases while they are active. 
---
This game isnt lore friendly full stop. Why try to theory craft how the lore fits a gun being in the game?
---
That was true of the previous patch, for sure.  It's a particularly arbitrary thing for them not to buy (in a list full of arbitrary things), especially when they will buy Antibiotics.
---
Excavator power armor issue: Is there anyway to fix the issue of exiting the armor and entering again you loose all bonus carry? 
---
Private servers doesn't feel like a basic feature to me personally, but I suppose that is up got debate
---
oh that sweet sweet ballistic fibre, any tips where to find it other than ammo bags?
---
Did someone down vote this? What's your tag, bro. Time for some griefing.
---
Nerf all of them. As the responses suggest, PvP is silly with guns like this. It's basically who pulls the trigger first.
---
You died. It happens. Move on
---
This is the kind of stuff that should be in the patch notes.  
---
Ginormous if factual
---
Thanks. Not found a single flamer in the game yet, but ought to start saving fuel I suppose.
---
Keep the Two-Shot pipe bolt action, Gatling Gun, Hardened Sniper Rifle and maybe the Combat Shotgun if you have perks for it. Sell, scrap or give away the rest. Maybe keep the Black Powder rifle if you like it.
---
In this day in age of MMO, companies should have the mechanics down. I get that there will always be exploits with bosses but with FO76, the exploits are affecting the play of others on the same server. I could care less if someone wants to duplicate items and sell them but when players are trying to play the game the correct way and have to deal with server crashes/rollbacks it gets frustrating to the point where you stop playing. I know there will be patches and bans but at what point does it become to much to deal with? I play when I can, so when i'm on i expect in that time i can get what I need to get done. Just would have been great to create something where it's still single player but the ability to play with friends.
---
I like your style.
---
You’re not alone.
---
Ive bought a twoshot pipe rifle and 10mm submachine gun.
---
The pipe rifle is way better
---
Well to begin, the first issue-
---
[Disconnected From Server]
---
Or maybe we are playing the game and not feeling scammed, and aren’t sheep having our opinions led around by the nose by the youtubers and other people who shout loudly? 
---
But people were told exactly what they were getting. You can't throw a temper tantrum after exactly what you ordered shows up, because you wanted it to be something else.  What, were people hoping that somewhere along the way, FedEx was going to magically transmute the plastic Nuka Dark shell into a real bottle?
---
I don’t see what people will gain from this. 
---
You can repair weapons/armor to 200% durability. Slow the breakage if weapons 50% unless it’s pipe weapons then it’s 90% less breakage and armor 90% less breakage.
---
Vats perks make vats criticals one of the best builds in the game. Accuracy is tied to weapon stats and your perception.
---
What good is a 24hour review you haven’t even seen 85% of the perks? 
---
The list of things you don't need to horde is shorter:
---
Fertilizer - Glass - Steel - Wood

MOST of the buildings are immune to changes I guess then (since the High School remains unchanged, though I'm guessing it's because of the Monster Mash event)
---
Ohh yeah we saw how much "Feed the people" brought people together. Everyone was running around solo, like they were bots. No one talked, it didn't feel at all like "Coming together". No one gave a sh#t who was there. One poor bastard was doing event, 16 bastards was getting free stuff, for what? For not giving a sh#t. We don't need some bullsh#t buff on game where everything is already easy. What we need challenge, that forces team to come together to succeed and reward those who actually pour out sweat. Take Destiny 2, it just had puzzle so hard, that it made its community come together, to try to solve that puzzle.

I built [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f946b56&amp;d=ic4ib4i10sw2s22sx2s32sr2pq1p53p02lt2le2s71cm2cu2eo2eh0a02&amp;w=sq2&amp;n=Explosive%20heavy%20gunner) for an alt I’m leveling. It needs to be updated with the recent changes to fireproof though. It has most of the cards helpful to heavy gunner so if anything it’s a good place to start
---
Military duct tape and ammo bags are the only place to get it other than buying it bulk from vendors
---
Are we playing the same hoarding game?
---
I silver line all the crashes by saying "well, the vendors refreshed" lol. If the game was more stable, I'd have it on pc and console. Pre ordered on console bc I hadn't finished building my pc. Now my pc is done and I'd like to play it on there too but I feel it'd be pissing money away. I'm level 302 on console. Lol. 
---
&gt; Wrong. It has story.
---
Yeah no.
---
&gt; At this point I don't think you've played 76 at all.
---
Name one character in the game. An actual character. Not a person's voice on a holotape. After you've named Grahm the supermutant trader, name one more "character" please.
---
&gt; Every game has a different "progression" system. Nothing removed, just changed.
---
They didn't "change" it. They removed it completely. They kept the perks but changed it into cards. The skill system however is completely gone.
---
&gt; The what.
---

---
&gt; Those thing were the CORE for YOU. 
---
Me and the majority of the fans. You think most fans of Fallout prefer Fallout 76 to the previous games? You're delusional.
---
&gt; But don't lie.
---
Yeah I think it's more you that should stop lying to yourself.
---
i killed a mothman finally with exposive ammo the other day
---
I tend to leave all of my goodies in Morgantown, Sutton, or Flatwoods.  I get way too overburdened with ammo, stims, chems, and duplicate plans, so I tend to leave stuff there for people.  I figure they can make nice surprises for people who are just getting their feet int he game and exploring those area.
---
Anecdotally, server disconnects seem a lot more common when Nuke Events happen.  I don't think that should come as a surprise.  But like, yesterday, I saw one nuke get dropped and outside of one (surprisingly fortuitous) disconnect, I didn't have problems all day.
---
There are private servers in Rainbow Six Siege, a game that can cost only $15 when not on sale. Also, most old games have private servers by default. Some strategy games have it. For a game that focuses around playing with your friends you would think it would be a basic feature to play with only your friends.
---
What’s the deal with that?
---
this requires knowing people to invite to your party. 
---
90% of my time in game has been solo. The only people I know that play are on PS4, i'm PC. I've teamed up with a few random people in game but never for long.
---
seems like unless you had private only servers that people would just use private servers to dupe even more unbothered so they can go back to public servers with even less worry about getting caught for crashing things. 
---
What, for you, needs to be fixed?
---
"Because it is" is not a reason to say something is bad
---
Overseer stashes may be instanced to the player, all I've ever found in them was the quest loot orginally and dog food/ boiled water every time after.
---
Have you tested with a friend?
---
Be careful with these because I've heard they can unintentionally start pvp if another player melees you and triggers the effect
---
I think it's similar story with the pocket watches. Aside from the gold itself the gold watches have fewer useful components that silver ones.
---
If you are willing to load into an instanced area, the prison in Grafton has about i think 6 or 7 of them inside. 
---
Damn it. I wanted a pic of the bot wearing them.
---
Lots of good opinions. Some feedback for your feedback:  
---
- Enemies scale to players in the area, but rabbits (and other critters) will always be level 1.  
---
- There are perks to reduce weapon/armor breakage rates. There are also perks to "over-repair" weapons and armor. The second set are almost must-haves, the first set less so (until you start using legendary equipment).  
---
- You may or may not have noticed, but until you start running into nuke zones on purpose, eating and drinking is one of the only ways you will be forced to deal with radiation most of the time. That's one of the reasons why we're forced to consume. (Another reason is simply that they put that much effort into the process, so "you are going to play it their way".)  
---
- Fast travel has to cost something, or no one would walk anywhere (no one unencumbered, anyway). Caps are just the best resource for that. Pretend you're paying someone to cart you over the hill or something. FWIW, playing with teammates mitigates that, because you can fast travel to your friends or their camps at no charge.  
---
- VATS is okay. For most gun folks, you either have to emphasize VATS or ignore it. I understand why it works the way it does, I just wish the numbers better represented your actual chances.  
---
- You said you're on PS4? Don't use the directional wheel, just use the left arrow on your d-pad to flip between your two most recent weapons. Note that when your game breaks, it flips you to unarmed and considers that your newest chosen weapon, so the d-pad won't work in that instance. Otherwise, it's way better than using the radial favorites menu.  
---
- I can't speak to your technical issues because I use XBox. I have been assuming all week that the servers are terrible because the dupers are going nuts, as their current golden goose is being killed.  
---
- And finally, the storylines. ...
---
You know, I understand why people don't like FO76's quests. There's no sense of player agency. You can't affect anything. But for me, that's a godsend as compared to other BGS games. Think of all of the quests from earlier Fallout or Elder Scrolls games. How many times is there a desperate sense of urgency? "You must stop the assassin!" "These settlers need help now!" "Super Mutants are enroute right now!" You get those quests and then you get distracted and wander off and in-game months or years can pass before you get around to actually stopping the assassin or helping the settlement. That's even more stupid IMO. The world hangs on your every word in previous BGS games. In FO76, they can't do that because how do you account for 24 people who can do that, who need to be that kind of special? You can't. So remove their ability to affect the outcome of the quest. That's what they did, and I think it works great for what it needs to do.  
---
Obviously, other people have their opinion and they're welcome to it.
---
Yeah I understand that I just wanted to make an attempt to make it lore friendly even though it’s not
---
That is exactly what happened to me too. 
---
Huh. A completely accidental discovery made me solve a riddle. Nice. 
---
Wonderful, thank you 
---
Is the update today?  I thought it was tomorrow.
---
Imagine being a low level who stumbled into watoga, and seeing people on top of a building just dropping dead for no reason
---
Damn, that's like 8% budget for your little note.
---
Now I wish grahm listed the types of fog crawler dishes
---
I have 15 STR, 15 PER, 1 END, 3 CHA, 5 INT, 9 AGI, 8 LCK
---
There's a ton of stuff in STR like unarmed, 2h melee, heavy weapons.  There's rifles in PER.  I typically always have rifle perks in perception and move my str perks around.  Unarmed is great as a low cost melee and you can fit a few other QoL perks in STR when using it.  If you don't want to wear a rad suit for schorchbeast queen though, you can swap to a 2h build or heavy weapons build.
---
It's pretty versatile in terms of options and also having good melee and ranged simultaneously.
---
Some new dupe bug involves crafting to crash the servers, and we got a "us' vs "them" situation on our hands.
---
I’m on console and I sell them
---
I block dick players that just want to kill me. That way they can't bother me unless I engage. 
---
Exactly, while we're at it, what's the lore behind .50 cal machine guns doing next to no damage? In 2047 the military changed the definition of calibre so now a .50 cal is equivalent to a .22. Also the reason most of the guns from fallout 1 and 2 aren't in 76 is because West Virginia instated laws preventing the sale of certain firearms, limiting it to hunting rifles.
---
It runs like crap and is full of bugs.
---
It used to be even worse. 
---
Nope, had 5 the whole time.
---
Maybe it wears the suit too not be affected by the scorch plague? 
---
Cool. I'll have to check that out. 
---
My wife an I play together almost daily. It's a fun way to hang out, especially since we have three young kiddo's. 
---
It's funny though, even when she's not online with me she'll come in the room and say "you're about to die, you need to eat/drink something"
---
Cobalt is reasonably abundant around the edges of whitesprings (especially east side) along with a few spawns in the grounds itself; just look for glowing blue (the silt beans are subtle). Between Whitesprings and Prime you can stay pretty well supplied with all Flux
---
It's tomorrow. 
---
Those mats were in dozens of thousands for each item.
---
Played since Launch, ran into some issues now and then yes, but enjoyed 99% of my time. Now bugger off.
---
Maybe it wears the suit to be unaffected by the scorch plague?
---
All stations have a blue suitcase.  It seems to be the drop point of choice.  I know it is for me.
---
Prime is a receiver. Heavy barrel is barrel. They don’t replace each other. 
---
I'm not interested in what other games have and what they cost. You know what you purchased when you purchased it. If you didn't like the price point... Don't purchase it.
---
Heh.. I paid 500 caps for my mutations. because I had the mats.
---
Got lucky with the first 2 from random rads and bought 2 more. I guess I could get marsupial also.. I dunno. Not good enough.
---
I like the idea of paying more for something though. I can't even sell stuff because I have nothing to buy.
---
Investing caps in quests would be great if you could guarantee not to disconnect and waste them. Hopefully people at bethesda are playing the game along side us at hardcore levels and are thinking about these things as well.
---
Youve only just picked up the game and you are going out to bat for it so soon? I doubt your story.
---
So no FEED THE PEOPLE, and now shit drops only for the first, and a bounty on top.   Whats next: locking cook fires and stations, only the last shot gets exp and items, fast travel to friends is x2 the cost of normal FT?    
---
Why do they keep making the game unfriendly?  Bet PLEASE just fix the bugs that make the game stop every 30 mins and leave the community helping quest/bugs alone.  Some of us dropped supplies just for lower levels to pick up. 
---
Use the 1 star card Chemist with a 3 Star Supa Dupa and you will be swimming in Chems in no time.
---
(1 star Chemist card gives you double what you craft at a Chem station, then Supa Dupa has a chance to double that.)
---
yes i know, but if he wants more cobalt i’m saying north west is a very good place and my go to nuke. just a suggestion. 
---
maybe their springs were made of gold too and are no longer useable.
---
99% of the time I'm in the "proof" camp.  But something is off.  PS4 version last night, several rollbacks.  Disconnect then when you log back in, your in a different spot with 'something' missing. In my case, it was waypoints I KNOW I hit on a newish character, and logging in somewhere I had done 10-15 minutes prior to DC
---
It’s random to which type of enemy spawns there. The best enemies are ghouls since they give the most experience but they don’t really spawn there. It’s mostly just mutants, robots, or scorched. But that’s not saying it’s good spot to kill enemies, but white spring is still better. 
---
Hello again Rifleman! I have to try it out. Even if I don't play with a team, the Death Man Sprint perk will compensate it if I had less than 50% health. I will test it all but I think it will take a few days. :) 
---
I love traveling to Flatwoods and handing out key plans like water pumps or generators and other clutch supplies for low level players. Some of them are kinda weird about it but I probably would have been too if I had just started the game and somebody came by offering charity. 
---
He's in that secret dev room.
---
The only human NPC in the game.
---
If you can wait till 5:30 I’ll be on to help. I also have a nuke card we can do another silo as soon as we finish yours. Level 83 DmoTorZ ps4 eastern.
---
The problem is that Bethesda keeps spoon feeding them, well, problems.  I love fallout, and if I'm honest with myself, it's the only reason I still play this game.  It's still riddled with bugs, and frankly, I've done everything there is to do.  I have every location on the map and most of the plans.  I've lost a couple friends playing because of boredom, but I keep going.  For those not like me and the rest of us fan boys, and even for some of those like us, the game is just a let down.  After the last patch patch, I'm crashing to windows every 45 minutes to an hour.  That really sucks when it happens after a death but before I get my junk back...  ugh.
---
I think Bethesda needed another 10-18 months to really polish this game before releasing it.  It would likely still have had some game-play issues like the tiny stash (though a real beta would have caught it) and a lack of endgame.  However, if the devs didn't have to spend 24/7 fighting fires, all of that could be remedied relatively quickly.  For now, I'll keep chugging along for level 153 and sending excess gear to my four alt mules.  I hope everybody else is able to keep on keeping on as well.
---
Well a lot of the reason for the disconnect is the lack of communication.  I played WoW for years and honestly some of my best memories were the conversations.  76 lacks a chat system that’s geared toward how people actually communicate.  A mic only system was a terrible idea, the game needs a global text chat feature.  With no communication it’s easy to ignore everyone.
---
Th ams for all the help guys. Greatly appreciated
---
I am thrifty, I can do a lot with a budget.  I will post pics if u want.
---
The only reason I'm putting some stock into it is that I started getting kicked off every few minutes on PS4 last night, when I haven't had that problem in my previous 190 hours.
---
Do you have video evidence of you picking it up? I'd assume no, but you didn't break their terms and conditions since you weren't the one who exploited a bug.
---
Game launch was not smooth but also not out of the ordinary for this type of online game.
---
the funny thing about people is that you don't have to know a lot of people, you just have to meet certain people who know  a lot of people. 
---
hang out in the discords and there'll be people lfg and stuff. When in nuke zones set to area chat and see if anyone wants to join party for rad sponge. 
---
You have shit observation then, hah
---
It leaves the stuff built by the previous owner for a bit. You get a head start once you claim the workshop. 
---
Did you check the workshop to see if it was claimable? If someone owns a workshop and leaves the server, the workshop becomes unowned but their stuff that they built stays.
---
Look for  enemies with the crown displayed beside their name. They'll keep spawning their own kind if you don't kill them.
---
I think stuff  stays with workshop after they leave the game.  
---
Remnants of the last person who owned it. I find stuff all the time when I go to claim them
---
I think Wallace is at Harper's Ferry.
---
People who wield automatic guns
---
What do you think happens when someone owns it and disconnects? All the stuff stays but nobody owns it 
---
I haven't played too much but I played for 2 hours last night. Didnt get kicked off. Dunno
---
Because its broke is good enough for me, if you dont think shit needs fixed your lying.   Game is broke as fuck, I havent touched it in 3 weeks.  Itd be great if they fixed it but three patches in I've lost faith.
---
you can't play if your game isn't up to date.
---
Yep, both on PC. I'm Level 34 and she's 25. We spend a lot of time looking for plans to make our bases more awesome...
---
You realize this "new method" is for PC right? Since the old method hasn't been patched just yet on console. You're jumping at ghost that nothing more then a shadow
---
Can confirm I've seen the queen go down way too quickly as well.
---
All the time 
---
Grab it. It stacks with ammosmith
---
Not going to waste time on anything else but naming a character because I stopped reading just there.
---
Rose.
---
That concept looks sweet as f, I'd deffo have one that looks like that.
---
Only one problem tho, given it's the enclave wouldn't the power armor be x-01 or an even earlier not seen before design.
---
That colour on a x-01 would also look incredibly awesome 
---
Right now I am seriously deficient in lead, steel, cloth and acid after making a ton of ammo
---
I'll have to check what one of my buddies is wearing, but the other teamate was in power armor and she did not have this mod on.
---
I also didn't have this issue before I got mutated. I was able to tank this attack fairly well. I'm also wearing ultacite power armor and the Ultasonic attack just shreds through it.
---
We should “double date” sometime! We are also on PC. I think that would be great...
---
Kind of a shame, to be honest. I was sincerely hoping that it was a new species of alien entirely.
---
That looks far nicer than whatever goofy flags or stripes or whatever Bethesda probably has cooked up.
---
Thanks for ruining my expectation and setting me up for disappointment. ;)
---
I'm not your fam and there's nothing deep about people being irritated at seeing unfounded crap float to the top daily
---
they do ? (silently oiling an polishing my big gun) :D
---
To watch your tear parade? Thank you!
---
Sadly they only announced it on Twitter but the update was moved to tomorrow 
---
That's a fucking lie, or you've lied about playing "more games." Because I've been playing games forever and this was not the worst at launch. It was a bad launch, yes, but not the worst because you could actually log in and play. Many other games you'd have to wait days to be playable. 
---
&gt; I have made so much lead I can't find enough steel to keep up with it. Yeah, steel is the material I need the most when playing a ballistic character, oh that and acid.
---
I found out about the Acid bulk/scrap like 1 day before the patch (it used to cost 10 acid to bulk and would scrap to 15). 
---
But for steel, hit up Grafton Steel yard. Not because of the resource nodes....but because trying to take over the workshop confronts you with about 50 super mutants. Loot every single weapon, equip the scrapper perk and scrap them all. You'll get about 200 steel from that. On top of it, just claim the workshop and power up the 2 steel extractors and if you're lucky enough for your game to not crash, you can get another 100 in about an hour while you do other things. 
---
10€ on cdkeys
---
Yes, that's what I thought! I haven't launched a nuke yet, so I was afraid it was part of the last main quest, but apparently not. Someone at twitter mentioned it could be a listening device for espionage. Makes sense to me. 
---
The guy was playing dumb. I'm not gonna waste time explaining to him the controversy with this game when it's literally all over the internet. That's what I meant.
---
Apparently can't play much if it is either. Shrug.
---
I'm hardly on discord, not real savvy with it. Only boot it up when someone is like "hey whats your discord?".
---
Whats LFG?
---
I'm level 45ish but have only done 2 nuke zones (morgantown + white springs). Haven't been to Watoga area yet. 
---
Kill, loot, *scrap, sell to vendor. FTFY
---
Okay sounds fine, we can do that, i don’t have a mic but i know what I’m doing 
---
I get bugged by the bugs. 
---
Empathy is really buggy especially when combined with Strange In Numbers. I think that's what you're experiencing.
---
Bird Bones has the same problem and you end up just walking in air all the time.
---
Do you really think Bethesda will be adding private servers to this dumpster fire? 
---
Wait I understood everything wrong. I thought they told about the case a week after, not before.
---
Shit, both times I figured the unowned label was a bug and I didn’t wanna steal someone’s workshop. Good to know! I guess I assumed their stuff would disappear no different from their camp. 
---
hahahaha, you dirty little... :D
---
It is strange that it says nothing when you hover it. I was expecting some message like "you need a key to open this"...
---
Yeah but theres nothing in it and the textures are objectively very low quality. Polish is 0, gameplay was clearly haphazardly designed, balance wasn't even considered. Bugs reported and fixed by modders in fallout 3(!!!) are still there today.
---
Just like your post adds anything to this sub? Jesus just log off the internet 
---
My favorite thing to do when I find someone's camp is open their shutters and click on their bed. Then I get up and walk around their house. They are so confused as to how I got in...it's hilarious.
---
Also, one of the brick wall windows, you can just walk right through it unimpeded. A lot of people don't realize that.
---
Don't place your bed close to windows people...people can crawl into your bed that way and get inside.
---
HELP YOURSELF TO DEM BAGS 
---
they sell for more at Whitesprings.
---
Aliens with Disabilities Act?
---
Yeah because tse everywhere is a challenge. It's just a matter of who can shoot first
---
I get what you're saying, the Mire's probably the best example of this as you got several deserted settlements inhabited with Gulpers, Anglers and Hermit Crabs which helps it stay feeling fresh. 
---
The passive wildlife has made a massive difference as well to be fair, makes the world feel much more realistic as there's a clear food chain now. 
---
Ironically I've seen the Grafton Monster in Charleston way more than in Grafton itself, the only time I see it at it's namesake is during the Grafton Day event. 
---
How can it be a TSE if it isn't exploding??
---
They said they would add private servers and said nothing about price.
---
Cool
---
It’s all luck. Level and such are unrelated. Only requirement is a two star or more enemy 
---
yeah but most of the "I'm level xyz" people just played in whitespring for most of the game because that is the only place to level so if something isn't there you wouldn't have
---
Yes!!! My thoughts exactly!
---
Theres a marine helmet?!  Do you know where the plans might be sold?
---
Thanks! Yea it threw me off when I saw it was T-60, could be a place holder. If not then probably a whole different take on the T-60 knowing the Enclave.
---
If you're not going to read what I reply, then why on earth are you even talking to me?
---
Errrm, well I gotta reconsider then - the taxes at watoga and all you know ...
---
Yeah i got a good start on mutations, then just bought the remaining 3 from the vendor.  I shy away from buying those from players because duping.  Super pricy but worth it.
---
Hahaha this game 
---
This game really lacks some clean black non-rusty paintjobs
---
Okay I played too much at first and got bored but the game itself was fun af 
---
I get disconnected all the time suddenly. I didn't have that problem until this week. Won't be playing until it is fixed. I've been defending them so hard and they just can't get it together on any front. WTF. 
---
*revives with vodka* Quack Doctor for ya
---
true I've seen this myself, can make fights with her much more intense
---
go to the reddit f76 bazaar or market. Many endgame users are selling them for 2-500.
---
Good point - Its TS... not TSE... but still I've not seen a single TS.  
---
Last night was especially bad, I had never really noticed it before other than first starting on a new server, but I was trying to get defenses setup at a workshop and the delay from just attaching a wire from one post to another was taking 5-10 seconds to respond. Then of course not shortly after some level 100+ comes in and contests it and blasts me, one shot. I'm not a low level but not 100+ yet. I feel that at 70 I'd stand a pretty fair chance but he just kept trolling me and following me around trying to get me to shoot him accidentally so we'd fight. I'd just go home drop my loot and wander around. Got to the point I just logged out. What's the point? Trying to get people to stop playing by being a total dick drip? Hasn't happened often may have been the actual first time I got trolled like that. PvP will never be a thing if there's these fuck tards running around.
---
Lmao this is so true
---
TSE= two shot exploding. If no exploding it's not a tse. Are you on Xbox tho? I do a pistol build bc I got a tse .44 from awol armaments and have been trying desperately to get a second two shot pistol. 
---
Server stability is the real end game boss 
---
idk, i mean it definitely has its issues but as a casual gamer i'm enjoying it a lot.
---
Yes, just like the door on the space station. I assume it's for some future dlc. Still cool to find it! \^\_\^
---
I had no issue with bugs the only ones that made me really frustrated was stuck in pa glitch,dupe glitches, and server d/c but everything else was okay for me
---
Totally Agree
---
It seems like that would potentially apply to more than just beds, right?  Any of the workshops would probably do it too.
---
Nothing happens, because firstly you're a troll. Secondly the stash is now 600 as of a fucking month ago. Maybe you should read?
---
If your Inventory is loaded with Ammo which you dont use, i dont think so.
---
I like you mention that you have had this game two days and that it's disconnected multiple times in that period. Like you won't find that annoying the 500th time even if you forgive the first 5. 
---
Sold? No. I got it as a world spawn in Camden Park next to the armour workbench there. In the little raider former trading post area. 
---
Same here on PS4.
---
Lmao what? That’s crazy
---
Disease cures have always been rare for me, no Pharma perk though.
---
Gat damn raiders
---
So now we're going to be complaining about being 'spawn camped'. Is this what happens when you expose the single-player game market to online PvP? They cry?
---
How about hopping servers if you don't like the people on your current one?
---
I got 3 yesterday from the golf club. A lever action a 44 revolver and a laser pistol ( which I just dumped it a suitcase at the station) all in all a good day 
---
It was clarified a week after it was announced, but well before anything was shipped. In fact, if I remember my details correctly, it was actually delayed for a couple months.  
---
So yes, it's a case of people not clearly reading about what they were buying, or buying something clearly overpriced, then complaining about it because it's worth huge points and clicks on the Internet. Fake news travels around the world before facts can even get out of bed in the morning.  No one pays for the truth any more, then just want the sizzle of something sensational.  Doesn't matter if it's false.
---
Ahh wouldn't that be a dream. 
---
You filthy mutant, succumb to my gattling laser immediately!
---
One man's junk is another man's treasure
---
I wish! 
---
You should unsub from here and go do something else 
---
Does that even work? I just rushed up a char from level 5 and the explosions wouldn’t even kill him
---
You don't report them. You're a snitch if you do. Snitches get no respect. 
---
Word of advice, do not EVER do anything to get yourself locked up. You fucking piece of shit snitch.
---
I killed a sentry bot once and it had 35 fusion cores, the best part it was a non PA build...
---
I just watched the video again. That true was the real end game. Be the cop of the game.

I'd make it your next 3 cards honestly. It's super useful. In fact, I nearly crafted 2 full X-01 PA with it because it apparently dupes armor sometimes too. The funny thing is, the duped armor is attached to the same PA. I was wondering why I had 2 torsos, and 3 legs, 3 arms and 2 helmets attached to the same PA. 
---
It rolls the 30% chance (at level 3) for everything except bulking. 
---
I have infinite stimpacks as I use diluted ones and have chemist perk (craft 2x aids). 1 stim pack yields between 4-6 diluted (the dupe happens before other crafting bonuses sadly). With this and the "First Aid" perk, I've never come close to even be low on stimpacks and I spam them all the time. 
---
It was supposed to be Monday during the first post but they changed it quickly. 
---
Short for "Looking for group". I'll direct message you some invites for some fallout discord servers
---
Can anyone share the location of the B2-RS cell key? im still missing that after a lot of search around the place...
---
Responder Bot was the first time I've seen them.  Shame it's in such ratty condition, would be a pretty good set if it was "Clean".
---
Looks like he sells 2 outfits every time and some of them are pretty rare.  We held him for a bit and bought Hunter's Longcoat, Longshoreman Outfit, a few variations on the fishing outfit, clean skiing outfit, clean ranger outfit, and clean space suit, as well as the winter coat and a few skiing variations.
---
Really makes me wonder what his comprehensive loot table is.
---
Negative
---
The behemoth spawn is on the other-side of the mountains where that red icon is.  That is where I have my base setup.
---
I find them all the time...although I haven't checked post patch.
---
I stopped using them since I found out about the fountain at White Springs though. If you are on PC, you can have mine.
---
That looks really good, but put it on a Ultracite PA, and design a jetpack for it at the same time, then sell it for big bucks to  Bethesda, pretty pleeaase :D
---
Who doesn't?
---
I had a very convenient boot.  The high level player chasing me around the map came into the Watoga vendor, we saw each other at the same time.  I bolt for the door, he gives chase, pulling out his TSE shotgun.  My AP is running low, I won't make it around the corner before he pulls the trigger, I'm swearing like 1950s sailor, then boom, black screen and the disconnected message.  I have never been so happy about a disconnect.
---
Wow he basically has all the stuff I want, I wish there was a way to track it, and Grahm 
---
The SBQ lag attack needs a nerf
---
Yeah i like 1 and 2.  I'd even go for silo type missions that are restricted to one team.  Aka instanced dungeons.
---
They could even make targeting legendaries harder than you suggest and it will probably still be worthwhile.  Throw in the ability to choose your armor type and it might be a winner.
---
But muh Steam overlay
---
"I don't understand why..." Jeez you must be living under a rock
---
Forest Region is at the watch tower near Vault76
---
Mountains by the coal train depot, is north of Top of the World, heading towards Sunny Top station where there is an abandoned mine, its right of the train tracks up on a rock face
---
Cliffs overlooking the bog i presume is the one east of Spruce Knob, near another watch tower.
---
I was beginning to wonder if such a thing existed.
---
There's an armor rating for your head, but I've yet to find any head gear that actually offers armor points.
---
Okay start with the server instability, constant bugs, ugly textures, bad pop in, bad frame rate, bad UI design, reloading animations that get interrupted when switching between first and third person (was in fallout 3 and 4 btw), then fix the sleazy business practices from false advertising to insulting customers and then it'll almost be half the rust clone they envisioned.
---
There are a lot of areas that have quests close enough to Lewisburg that whenever people are entering that map cell it's triggering respawns.
---
No proof needed of that since 2014-2016, starting with Gamergate onward to the 2016 us election.  That was the lowest point in gamer youtube garbage and clickbait and volatility and it hasn't gotten better.
---
I got like 2000 of them shits 
---
If you have a buddy you can just swap logouts.  It's a bit of a nuisance but pretty doable.  I think we put about an hour into it.
---
He does sell the Cuckoo Clock and Nuka Clock plans every time.  Had to stop buying them up or I was going to go broke!
---
Hey thank you! I would love to trade you for them. I'm ahandmadegrin in fo76 as well. 
---
Meh yes it does.  He isn't using mutations so he doesn't need more than 3 for VATS  and maybe a couple in Good with Salt.   He said he's got 15 in Strength, just like my character who is always in  PA and melees.  Stick to giving advice about your own build.
---
Got it, thanks. 
---
NOT A TSE VERSION
---
*Gives you a hug* (currently has Plaguewalker)
---
I thought that also but it might not be different for every single player. Only reason I say that is because, I was looking at the Command center Enclave vendor at a X01 torso mod, exited the screen because I didn't have Hard Bargain equipped and when I went back to it, it was gone. There was another player right next to me at another terminal. 
---
Ends up being your only option.
---
At least you can be grateful you don't lose anything of value. And that everyone probably has too much junk anyways.
---
I dont have too much of an issue with pvp games. I spend a lot of time playing RDO or I played gtaV for a while. I just dislike being 1 shot in power armor 3 times by someone whos 3 times my level without returning fire.
---
by what? 😟 
---
Lmao it's that fucking easy? Wtf Bethesda...
---
you can only "rank" up or down on a second card of the same perk...
---
Yeah they were rare for me as well but I always had a few on hand. Total drought since the patch. None at vendors, none from mobs, none from med boxes, none from medicine cabinets. 
---
So if I get something really good should I log out as quickly as possible? If you log out successfully does that essentially update your save file or would that server crashing some time after you log out bone you anyway?
---
I would assume, but I seem to find a lot more beds close to windows than i do workbenches. I'll have to check later.
---
lmfao, I could definitely try it xD
---
Play the game for 1 months month, you will understand 
---
AW that is adorable, I love it
---
it's even more frustrating when it teleports away, makes it feel more mysterious but when you've been waiting on killing one it is a right downer
---
No I haven’t.  Dang 
---
.308 Winchester is a bit shorter than the .30-06, and many MG42s were converted to it after the war, redesignated MG2. The MG3 was an improved version that introduced a few years later. 
---
I'm in this strange place where I hate this game with a passion but can still have fun. It kinda annoys me. There really isn't anything to do but farm drops off ghouls and I can mindlessly do that for hours.
---
I'm a pretty enthusiastic fo4 player and I've been telling my bf for months about how much I love the game. He's more into MMORPG's so when fo76 came out he bought it. He plays fo76 and I watch him. I swear, the first couple of days were SO frustrating when he wouldn't see all the things he could pick up or when he wouldn't try the VATS or when he was super clumsy with the controls. But now he's getting a lot better and it's getting less stressful and more fun watching him. He asks me for advice and I am his cheerleader when he's shooting scorched. 
---
I played like 100+ solo and it's super super rare that you get that kind of people , mostly people help you there at least with something 
---
If you died to an explosion, like a car blowing up after eating some stray bullets, there is usually not a chance to call for help.
---
Idk, I'm just throwing some suggestions around. Those games have been around for a decade by now, and the community has heavily shaped them, even if average player counts are below 100. But I remember even in the original sessions of FOnline 2238, there was a similar formula: highest tier gear was extremely rare and limited to dungeons/events, rare resources with cooldowns were needed for higher tier gear crafting, and caps were required for multiple end-game things. You had essentially infinite storage because you could create yourself a tent, which was a whole cell that only you could access (unless you brought somebody in with you). You had a crate inside the actual tent, and you could drop loot in the area around it as well. The map is large enough that you could actually just organize it by dropping each individual item on a different hex if you wanted.
---
The issue with this game is you don't NEED anything at all - you can find plans for pretty much everything you need, you can easily sustain yourself just using looted weapons and armor, power armor makes everything extremely easy, etc. You can get to level 50 and have everything you need without spending a single cap. This by itself isn't bad, but with a playerbase that loves to hoard, having so many limits on everything is problematic. I can't stress how much I wish that bethesda just looks at how some of the FOnline sessions handled these issues. 
---
I've never really played online before so ama bit of a lone wanderer, but I don't mind I'll just track him down 
---
Can’t seem to find it in the app. Saving for when I can log in to a computer
---
I'd wear that. 
---
Well ... it's no review, these are just my impressions and I force nobody to read them ;)  
---
But anyway thanks for the info on the perks ...
---
Thank you for your reply. That would be great.
---
You're not alone, I haven't seen one either.
---
IIRC, microprocessors exist in Fallout, but they were invented much later and weren't widespread before the bombs. 
---
Honestly, that's probably the best way to ensure it doesn't get lost to a roll back. Logging out does seem to *force save* your current state.
---
Theory CONFIRMED!

I just budgeted it in.. my build left room for 2 turrets and 2 spotlights.  I just bought neon lights over the weekend.  I wasn't using the turrets so i just scrapped them. ezpz

My house is 2x4 2-story with surrounding foundation.  3 industrial purifiers and 16 crops.  Plenty of lighting and decorations.  I even have a sign with small letters indicating that i leave free stuff in a mailbox out front.

So there's that, I guess?

Vendors within the same group all share a cap pool. I don't know if it will help any:
---
* Responders (all over the left side of the map, I use Charlestone Fire Department usually)
---
* Raider (I use Sutton station)
---
* Whitespring (All the vendors there, including the Whitespring Train station)
---
* Enclave (All those in the bunker)
---
* Free States (Harpers Ferry)
---
* Brotherhood (Watoga Shopping Plaza)
---
* Watoga Train Station (Graham uses this cap pool too)
---
FO76 the worst game ever developed imo. Pure diarrhea 
---
I affectionally called it "Shadow Dancing" in Skyrim for the buff of shadow/smoke that would come out each time you crouched.  When I saw the escape artist perk it was one of the first things I experimented with to see if it was the same way.  Only drawback is that there are some enemies that will never drop aggro with it and others that have targeted true sight aggro.  
---
Is there any proof of the existance of this said dev room? Even the videos I've seen about it seem sketchy.
---
The fact ark is one of your favourites shows your bug tolerance is incredibly high.
---
I had like 20% hidden in my storage after the PC patch. Most of it was mutfruit plants.
---
I seem to always do this with excess ammo i seem to pick up but don't use. Find a container and unload.
---
Me too. Usually in the cash register, and often at the Charleston station since there are often a few players in the area.
---
Same problem with steel. Got a shit ton of lead but nowhere near enough steel to craft ammo. I've got my camp on the acid vein near the golf club and a grafton monster spawns there dropping 5-6 acid when killed so acid is not a problem.
---
You can force a spawn event by travelling to the Charleston station and running north along the railroad tracks until you get to the bridge (actually a bit before, but I usually just run to the bridge).  SOME sort of event/spawn will occur and the vendor bot can be one of them.  Took me...10ish tries over the course of a week to pop him.
---
How do you know its duping and not something else? Got any source
---
Bro it's a literal mg 42 bro
---
Bethesda ensuring gameplay integrity? Pull the other one.
---
I meant shit like Feed The People giving 5 soup to everyone in the server. Everyone thought that was intended. Turns out it was a bug and just about everyone disliked that they fixed it. I used to do that event when it popped up because of that, but now I ignore it. 
---
I'm around the same level (20's), and there's no grind for adhesive.   
---
Mutfruit, tato, corn and purified water makes vegetable starch at the cooking station. Scrapping vegetable starch makes 2 adhesive. I just pick up the materials at the start or end of each game session when I'm already in my CAMP.   
---
It only took me one trip to Morgantown (by the airport) to get enough materials to setup a permanent farm at my CAMP since I already had enough fertilizer on hand (from rot). I still grab all the duct tape I can find, but I no longer find adhesive is limiting my crafting options. 
---
The way several reviewers and YouTube channels handled F76 caused me to move on from them. I am level 86, and if I were honest, this is my favorite Fallout game to date. My only issue with this game is the disconnects.
---
Bro 200 fire rate at 178 damage bro 
---
And the school district! Ugh! That high school looks as if a nuclear bomb went off...
---
If the M2 had realistic damage, there would be no point in using other weapons. Gameplay balance to keep DPS close enough to give you choices. 
---
I use electrically charged with tesla coils on my excavator PA. It's well confusing.
---
That's actually really near my Camp, good to know 
---
Interesting, can you be in PA and get the same effect while you were wearing assassins/sentinels before entering PA?  I'm curious if you lose the buff when you get into PA or if it still applies. 
---
i have it on xbox, the queen drops the plan, but very / extremely seldom... :/
---
Yep
---
That stuff is generally built out of the workshop’s budget. Not the player’s. 
---
Damn... I really loved that game.
---
Thanks for your input, it's very welcome ... and I agree with you on the "urgency" issue ;) That makes sense for a multiplayer title, I believe that's my problem: I treat the game too much as a single player experience...
---
Good to know thank you 
---
It’s the same shit from any release.
---
Entitled bitches dilute the market with their tears so it takes reasonable people longer to get their hands on the game.
---
Yeah it has its flaws. But it’s a great game. Well worth it.
---
Older than the trees?
---
Just to be clear, I'd never actually say it aloud myself, some things we have to take on faith. :\^)
---
Are you as equally sick of all the complaining posts?
---
ah wondered why i was getting randomly nuked by them guess this was it
---
To start; there are quests coming to Sea of Thieves, but comparing it in that regard to Sea of Thieves is like comparing the quest content of something like an MMO to the quest content of a Battlefield game (as in one has quests and the other has task lists). Go figure, you're comparing a multiplayer RPG to an open world exploration game.  
---
You've only been playing for around 3 days (according to what you said). There's still plenty of time for bugs to hit you hard (like the new wave of dupe-related bugs that cause the server to completely roll back everyone's progress anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, including quests and looted gear). 
---
What is ammo? 
---
lol :D
---
Wow, didn’t know that either. I hardly build anything at workshops because I don’t want to waste my personal materials stash on a temporary base. I’ve been doing this all wrong! 
---
Totally man. It’s obvious that one guy worked out how to cheese power armour and uploaded the vid, got his likes and made his money. 
---
Then others followed suit. 
---
Big circle jerk of hipsters/Youtubers looking to post content that grabs your attention. But essentially what they have done is lie. 
---
It’s like Brexit. We had a story here a few weeks back that the Brexit agreement “doesn’t mention wales”. 
---
Massive upset. Bad reviews and condemned everywhere. Yet it didn’t mention England either. Just a simply white lie to get people reading your paper.
---
But essentially bullshit. 
---
Great, will add later. :)
---
Just a warning I only have 10 I keep on my at a time, but if I find more I will definitely give you those as well.
---
Unfortunately I haven't had a social menu since launch. The only way I can join teams is via the map in-game. 
---
If you were on PC, I’d be able to craft you one. Ask around on the FO76Bazaar subreddit, you can probably find someone on Xbox who can make the whole set.
---
I think it works in the way that since they are both the same effect type, they stack. So you should be doing 50% before incizor, and 125% after it
---
*pumps you with a healthy dose of RadAway while being hugged* There, that's better
---
My wife and I do enjoy playing 76 together.  She doesn't play as much as I do, but it makes the game a lot more fun  when she does.
---
It's not alleged. It has existed since the Far Harbor DLC for Fallout 4 when lever rifles were added to the game
---
no you can only craft X-01 and excavation, you have to repair the rest 
---
Honestly from a AAA publisher it doesn't really get worse than this... All hyperbole aside.
---
They will not be adding "explosive resistant paint" to the Atomic Shop, cosmetics only.
---
"Why the hate?" 
---
 Umm the ignorance is strong on this one , or maybe you're just suffering of DPS ( Defend my purchase syndrome)
---
ppl use there routers also, so there is two new ways to dupe? what the F\*\*k. my games been super laggy got dc  a fair bit to find my self roll back into where i left.
---
"it burns, it burns" "arghhhhhhhh"
---
&gt; let's just call it Rad Rain
---
It's actually called fallout lol
---
It’s only like 8, but it also lowers perception by 2, like all non power armor gas masks
---
It's just a vocal minority. Most people are playing the game instead of complaining on social media. Is the game perfect? Ofcourse not. But me and my friends have been having a ton of fun
---
I'd also like wall sections that are just beams - so I can build a low country house with a wrap around porch.
---
except... you took the time to post..
---
considering i scrap every power armour i come across for the steel and plastic and never learned any mods I'd say either it's not possible or it's bugged
---
I don't have this problem. Reviving people with "E" works in all situations.
---
Yup I did sorta fun.
---
There's nothing currently in the game that requires you to team up, but you'll definitely benefit from being in a team. If you've got a decent headset, it may be worth casting about and looking for folks to team with as you progress. It'll give you help if you need it, shared perks, easier fast travel, and at the same time, you get to talk to someone who is into the game as much as you, so there's a fun social aspect as well.
---
But if you want to stick with the single player POV, there's no reason you can't.
---
I've seen pc and xbox1 players have it but yet on ps4.  The struggles and I've killed queen alot with no luck
---
I figured it’d disappear the same as their camp does? 
---
As I was the one receiving when I first started out, I now leave excess items (food/beverage, plans/recipes) in containers that are in the open like I have found when questing. I would like to believe people will only grab what they need but I don't know how true that holds. I also setup my CAMP so anyone can come grab purified water, in which i have noticed people doing :) This is where Bethesda did right but unfortunately some are making the online experience dreadful. 
---
If you get really desperate you could always make a stop at the sulfur fountain at the golf club gazebo.  If I used them each time I got a disease I'm sure I'd be out of them a long time ago, as it stands I barely have 10+ at any one time.
---
cool, add me if you'd like: fleshd4ddy. My camp is over at a pond by big fred's bbq shack so we've just been heading south just exploring. Though after checking out west tek we realized we might be better off finishing up the backlog of side quests we've accumulated :) We're usually on in the evening 7-8ish PST
---
Dont worry. I am lvl 130 and I only saw my first one yesterday. I killed my second one in the same server 2hrs later.
---
And my luck is 15 so
---
I’ve encountered the flatwoods monster and the moth man a handful of times are here. More specifically the part of the golf course near the miners monument.
---
"It just works" - Todd Howard. 
---
Sorry! I meant more in the sense of modifying armor. 
---
I think it should frenzy all of the scorched on the map, since the plague they have makes them act as a hive mind
---
Thank you very much! Always fun to add new folks to play with as well! 
---
What system
---
+50 carry weight perk leg
---
Thanks! 
---
No you cannot, and this particular outfit fucking sucks--equipping it \*REMOVES\* your underarmor.... not your actual armor (right/left arms/legs and chest), but your underarmor (BOS jumpsuit, Vault XX jumpsuit, military fatigues, long johns, etc.). Essentially using this outfit gimps your character out of a few extra stat points and resistances, unless you're the kind of person to run around in PA all day every day. But then why have the Rocketsuit?!
---
You can't all team together but you can be on the same server. Have 4 of your join together from the main menu, once in have one guy drop group and invite the others. They might have to queue, but you can at least be in the same server.
---
It's a damn shame too, the outfit is awesome and looks pretty epic on a fat guy.
---
Did you miss the line in the patch notes that said "Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated." ..?
---
I dont agree at all.. i can 1 shot over lvl 100 with x-01 power armor and at that point i believe there is no such thing as "pvp armor" its pretty much all from the legendary effects and like op said lvl 5 shotgun doing over 300 dmg and you cant get lvl 5 armor that has legendary effects what protects from that.. just guessing and but even with best gear you can be 2 shotted atleast. Without power armor explosive weapons almost every time cripple you (on top of doing fk load of dmg) and if  "best" power armor wearer can be one shotted you dont really have choice but to play without pvp
---
Sorry forgot GT. GrumpyDude
---
I paid £9 for it and I work in defence. I highly doubt it’s “DPS”. I didn’t even notice the funds leaving my account. 
---
The “issues” you’re all crying about are bullshit. Things like “you can get power armour tooooo easy”. So what?!? Isn’t an issue. 
---
“Oh but it’s just dropped and it has bugs”, yeah man, welcome to the modern world of software development (I’m  developer myself) 
---
“Oh but no story” - yes there fucking is. 
---
“But what about...” - just give up mate. Join your idols on YouTube who simply upset people to make money through views. 
---
I personally couldn’t give a toss if you got a shit bag in your collectors edition. Or if there was some disconnects from server on release. 
---
Non-issues. Just spoon fed, easily led people watching too much YouTube. 
---
You can also craft the Ultracite PA, and all the mods for it, over and over if you like, since it has plans and not mods ;)
---
But you will need to set up appointments with her Royal highness "The Queen" to get them :D
---
"There's nothing in it" 
---
You're embarrassing yourself.

It sounds so stupid when people just pump the same bullshit without any reasoning behind it.

Fog crawlers are deffo in the savage divide too, up near the investigators cabin area I was jumped by 5 at once.

That’s a pretty good closing line for a short story.

Just did. Slipped up on my part.

Which is a shame that is in Fallout 76, if it was in one of the single player games I'm sure at least it would had a bittersweet ending with the option of restoring the Order of Mysteries maybe even with the help of Kent Conelly

This "bug" is very annoying.

What we get is shit posts!

okay man no worries, i’ll take a look

A review is just a person experiencing something then giving their opinions on it right? 
---
Soo
---
I almost wish I had this problem. Only one star in Pharma Pharma and, if I get anything from it, it's usually 75% disease cures or 20% antibiotics. Try Fort Defiance, my usual med run. Get a bunch there. 
---
Are you calling me a duper?
---
It could also be the stacked bobble heads exploit as well instead of a bug. Right now the effect of bobble heads is cumulative so a duper can use a hundred explosive bobble heads and become pretty explosivey even with slap damage and that is also why they kill themselves.
---
It's a really strange mechanic.  You hear shots and go to an area thinking you might help out, and at the same time, you have to be mindful of how your presence may actually respawn everything.
---
Just the clarify, you’re certain it is the toolchest plan and not the large toolbox plan?
---
Like the overall build and thought process but A couple of points, as far as I'm aware adamantium skeleton and dodgy don't work in PA and serendipity 100% DOES NOT take effect when in PA. Plus dodgy is counterintuitive when playing melee as you need AP to sprint and power attack, things you'll be doing  a lot as someone who needs to be up in their face. 
---
Suppressor and tenderizer are both helpful if you're planning to work in a team and go against high level enemies. But at the same time aren't as useful when you're a melee build, as they both thrive off people rapidly shooting at enemies to keep the effect in constant use. If you're going solo you need the full level lone wanderer. 
---
Refractor Is also unnecessary when in PA as your ER will already be high, I'd 100% replace with glow sight. Nuke zones/high level events pour glowing enemies at you and they always have higher health so adding 60% damage is fantastic. 
---
 IMO born survivor isn't worth points unless you really don't want to think about healing yourself or forget a lot. 
---
Or if you want some alternatives/If you fancy taking it another way, and go for a bloodied melee build I'll link mine at the bottom. Extremely high DR, all attacks barely scratch you and you can one hit pretty much everything as a melee build. 
---

We need more threatening enemies, events become worthless when the dude with a tse comes in an one or two shots everything. Not bagging on TSEs since they're amazing, but it makes the game easy for everyone wheather they want it to be or not. Big group events with weapon restrictions would be nice, and by weap restrictions I mean legendary rolls. Idk though,  that's just my opinion. 
---
Yep. That’s the coolest screenshot I’ve seen so far.
---
There should be a perk, something like “Grace &amp; Power,” having completely mastered use of your power armor you obtain a bonus to unarmed. Make all those rusty knuckle mods and stuff worth something.

Funny part reading the people who make crap up without supporting facts, sounds like my 12 year old son talking crap with his friends. So when I read something that is so off the wall, I just think they are some kid who either is using the exploits or thinks you should cheat to level. Either way if people stop posting issues because of down votes then crap will stay broken.
---
Wild Stallions Rule!!!! 
---
I know right? The game is carbage and currently is given free in a game shop near i live, when buying anything costing 50€ and up. Just imagine how low the sales and the amount of returns must have been to the shop to take this route. I believe its going to be most referred flop ever in the industry. A textbook example
---
Thank you, I'll give it a shot! 
---
Cowboy hat is on Mad Hatter's table near the big ferris wheel 
---
I'm probably going to spend a day or two doing them and marking down what I get and how much of each
---
Could be. 
---
If you're desperate for cores, just find some power armor in the wild, loot the power core but don't claim the frame.  Server hop and there will be a new core to loot.  Repeat as needed.  It works like cap stash farming.
---
Where the FUCK do I find these letters!!! I want them so bad!!
---
TrapSense activated.
---
From what I understand they are still doing relatively the same thing and getting the dupe to still work. There are at least 3 videos on it atm sadly.
---
Ok, now you're making me feel pitty. 
---
I'll let it slide this time but Paladin Taggerdy won't be so nice if she finds you
---
Killed a super mutant suicider, 21 mini nukes. 
---
They stack but it's not additive, it's multiplicative. So you get diminishing returns and can never hit 100%.

---
I’ll be on as well lunygunz
---
What about aluminium? Practically all of the weapons in currently using need it.
---
Did you just call my Scorchy a bitch! She is just trying to rid the world of dupers like everyone else without a TSE shotgun.
---
Because everybody else I’ve spoken to appears to either think the game is good, or refers back to the same crap the Youtubers were on about. 
---
Not an original thought amongst the bay-sayers. 
---
Some have attempted though, one even wrote a list of issues. First 3 are him moaning the beta wasn’t long enough etc. 
---
It’s almost as if you all heard it’s shit. So you’ll all trying to describe it as such. 
---
When really I’m playing the exact game Bethesda promised me. 
---
Literally the exact game I was promised. Did you not know what the game was supposed to be when you logged in for the first time? 
---
You have a point. Considering there is a current government shutdown because we have adults acting like children, I shouldn't be surprised at all lol
---
There are 6 strings of cans at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. 3 in the big archway/raider scaffold bridge (they're high, you have to jump) and 3 in front of the hotel entrance (the building with the vendor inside) These latter 3 are often missing. There are also several lead weights across the street from the hotel entrance, in a bin. Then, a \~15 second hike north, there are 3 more strings of cans in Pleasant Valley Cabins, in the half-destroyed building that should be the first one you come to if you're heading north from the resort. With sufficient DR, you can ignore the enemies and just rush through these 3 sets of cans in under a minute from the fast travel/load point for Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. I think that comes to 101 lead per run, including the weights.
---
Oh crap nevermind yeah it's the large toolbox plan I see there sorry.
---
Okay :)
---
Yeah, i see a lot of cool spawns around there, good place to look around. My camp is just outside the fence of whitespring near the cliffs, the other day i saw a mothman contemplating suicide there, decided to make his decision a little easier if you catch my drift :p
---
That wouldn't surprise me. But BGS is at least showing interest in the issue. That gives them *some* credit (not a lot, but some).
---
Very true mate!
---
No but you should get END and AGI to 15 then use a bunch of mutations to increase them further, and get speed demon and marathoner so you can zip around the map
---
Honestly, the state of the game is if you don't have a TES gun your at a disadvantage, and like people said just about every TES is a dupe. And who wouldn't buy a TES for 500 caps or take one for free. As much as I enjoy my TSE not everyone should have one as is a God roll, and at this point they takes so much fun out of the game. I for one would not be salty if they wipe all TSE as there ALL dupes, and people can cry and make themselves feel better say my was a random drop, but in most cases it wasn't.   
---
It also annoys me when people say "people who buy them are just as bad" as someone who's been a trading since the game came out there is NO market for stuff thats not END game at the moment, unless the person buying is ignorant. But all in all I'd just keep play the game how you see fit (except for being a Duper) and just avoid toxic people and hope they can get this game in order for the upcoming traders patch.
---
That looks fantastic, have an upvote!
---
WOW Todd! You did it again. Best game design 2019
---
If you can't beat them join them? According to this sub complaining here is pointless because Bethesda isn't watching.
---
Also, one extra day to farm glowing ones. :)
---
Now you're generalizing me based on what others are saying in this thread specifically. 
---
Have you even looked at other posts on this subreddit? Lots of them are people posting screenshots/stories or suggestions to bethesda. Tune out the social media shit that you're hearing from twitter or youtube and just enjoy the game like you're already doing. You don't gotta come online and try to justify your purchase to a bunch of people just because you and your friends enjoy the game but some others might not.
---
I had a feeling it would be a nice nuke.
---
You balance crazy heavy weapons off of weight, recoil, and ammo weight. Plus limit use to power armor only. 
---
They have already admitted to not having the tools to track duping or player inventories. While they always could develop such tools, the faster we spread the duping bugs, the faster they have to fix them, the less time they have to develop said tools. I'd say its still pretty low risk to dupe right now.
---
Yah I always leave my extra plans and ammo and even legendaries that I don't need in the suitcases outside railway stations (the Raider station near Sutton and the Responders station near the power plant and Charleston in particular) or inside the cash registers of the vendor bot inside.
---
woulda been nice to not blow ourselves up with our own explosive weapons, too bad !!!!!
---
Which sounds more complicated:
---
Changing a decimal point or rewriting server code?
---
I need to do the research, for the people!
---
Yeah, its a protectron.  And there is 2 that can spawn - one is just normal and not a trader, the trader spawns with a pack brahmin
---
Following up: At 12pm ET today we will be doing a server-side hotfix to address this issue on PC only. 
---
Every time my brother comes to my CAMP to visit, he spawns in the foundation and I have to take my house apart to get him out. 
---
I’m probably just going to build an oldskool LEGO castle style trapdoor dungeon for him to spawn into. 
---
I can agree with that.
---
Why don't you pick it up? Just curious how that works.
---
No. I just find it odd that everyone is adding "not duped" to things they are selling. It does nothing for the value of the weapon as there is no way to tell if it is duped unless you see stacks of the same legendary weapon in someones inventory. 
---
Saturday night I had someone one shot me through pacifist mode in my x-01.  And completely destroy every piece of x-01 armor... 
---
They need to fix this stacking bobble heads crap real quick!
---
As a non-PA player, real curious about that poly-fiber power suit.  Under armor, or what?  Also, your concept looks crazy good.
---
why thank you my good sir!
---
Currently there is no faction based PVP. The current system in place is, if someone shoots you and you decide to shoot back, pvp starts. That's it.
---
I've never seen him be an eye bot before, that's wierd. Just make sure there aren't enemies around, traders usually won't trade if there's enemies near by. 
---
I play on a PS4. 
---
There were definitely some stability issues in the past, and I have noticed that usually I experience a few crashes after a patch, but I can honestly say that I regularly play for hours on end with no problems. 
---
It's stupid to get the dev room stuff. I would feel burnt out if I got endgame weapons and PA early on or if I didn't earn them from exploring or crafting after a long grind.
---
Oh yeah tesla rifle is all jacked up have a tse and ts am beyond disappointed that the tse loses any sign of tossing chain 🌩 around and fires a single explosive and the ts I haven't really played with to see if it works properly if you are correct I am even more bummed now 
---
OT, but: 
---
Almost everything you say is just your opinion on something you experienced in one way or the other ... Soo ;)
---
Salty children who don’t understand internet games downvoted me. Ye Gods, whatever shall I do.
---
Giant sloths are easy to find, if you google it though you can find behemoth spawns. They’re not that bad honestly. In fallout 3 I remember I shit my pants when I saw one. 
---
Owner disconnected.
---
I've run into the opposite a few times though. Where a workshop is owned according to the map, even in mid-defense event. But unowned when walking up to the actual bench.
---
I got 2...for a pair 2000 caps and for one 1200 caps
---
Historically their single player titles on this engine were essentially fixed by the modding community. Once the modders had a good fix in, there was no reason for Bethesda to invest money in it. 
---
This release is really the first time in possibly more then a decade when they are in the position of having to fix their own game by themselves. Add in the added complexity  of online multiplayer and I have serious doubts as to whether then have the ability to resolve issues, let alone the motivation.
---
Strange is number was fixed with the patch. No more walking on sunshine
---
Claim workshops and do the defend events. I’ve received numerous Small Letter Sets from doing that. That’s just me, though. I’ve seen people find them in the wild before too. 
---
I came across a friendly responder bot, but still have yet to trigger the vendor.  I am sick of running that bridge.
---
While I can see downvoting for those reasons, if you check the upvoted percentage on posts, there seems to always be someone downvoting at least once.
---
Letting everyone know that a server-side hotfix is going out today around 12pm ET to address this issue. It will be on PC only. Thanks!
---
LOL
---
My mate made a great point last night. He said that there's 20% of the game that's great and 80% that's utter horse shit. The 20% that's good is good enough to keep you playing.
---
We're still going through the "story" which is 80% awful with some good quest lines (Enclave and Mistress of Mystery) but on the whole, they need to fire the idiot that came up with most of this crap, especially that DMV mission guy. Not being from the state as my 2 friends are that play this, they said "Hey, this is EXACTLY like the DMV!" lmao.
---
I think we have more fun laughing at each other when one of us almost rage quits - it's hilarious as is the easy wind ups of when they get on TS saying some BS like "OMG all our characters got reset to level 1!!!!!" and hearing them start to bitch before creasing up in laughter.
---
Once we're done with the story, what the hell else is there to do? The game is over, give it up already. There's nothing left to do except move onto another fun game to play. You're missing out on other game by continuing to play a game well passed its play-by-date.
---
By the clubhouse?
---
And as I said in a previous reply, the context of this was 2 players following and repeatedly attacking another player the whole time he was on, and that shouldn't be happening anyway, but I personally think it especially shouldn't be happening since the player could be a kid or a young teen. 
---
In my experience no one uses hunter hunted, taking workshops from ppl is the way to go
---
Anyone got a good source of copper? I need to craft fusion cells for my explosive tesla shotgun.
---
I absolutely love the game and have over 350 hours in it. But I'm still getting around 2 blue screens an hour, along with the disconnects, lag, enemy bodies disappearing before I loot them and I'm even still getting enemies healing themselves after I shoot them. I had zero issues when I first started playing and it's just got worse the higher level I got
---
Awesome. To be clear, you mean last week's patch (tomorrow for console, probably) ?
---
As if we needed another reason to hate molerats.
---
Fallout doesn’t need redemption
---
If you wanna see a sloth go to TreeTops in The Mire there's one there all the time
---
I found an explosive tesla rifle.  It just shoots explosions, no arcs.  Its basically a M97 that uses fusion cells.
---
yeah, power armor doesn't have the dense mod, explosive damage is basically 0 if you have a chest piece with the dense mod and take 3 levels in fireproof after the most recent update, pile sentinels and assassins armor on top of that and you can tank most everything a player could throw at you.
---
I dunno maybe im out to lunch, but since completing the free states quest, I notice more scorchbeasts with a yellow colored health bar. Im guessing this means passive because they generally leave me alone and only directly attack me if I start attacking them, they still spam attack my camp the odd time, but generally attack once or twice than go back to their normal pattern.
---
They dont seem to like my couch inside my house for some reason.
---
If your in Cranberry Bog, learn where the AA turrets are at, in the BoS camps, they make SB encounters much easier. There are also tunnels in the bog so you can hide from them.
---
The easiest entrance for me to find is on the road south from the abandoned bog town to watoga. Look for a broken down shed on the west side of the road, the tunnel pretty much runs under this road. If you hit a semi trailer on the road, where you can go inside the trailer you went too far, run back north 50 ft ish to just before the bluff of trees on the west side of the road and look for a trench going under the road.
---
a different method that causes the servers to hard crash now.

---
Damn looks like another night of glitch ridden servers while everyone does last minute duping. 
---
Same sort of thing happened to me, every single ghoul at the golf club was a bloated glowing one.
---
You can mode an item with like the scorched mod and make it up to 4 stars and then another mod idk the name of to make it 5 stars
---
That raider montage was fantastic! Thanks for sharing mate.
---
Yeah, I've done numerous whitesprings run for loot drops since hitting 100.  I've gotten a bunch of TS weapons, and a few Exploding.  Haven't seen a TSE drop but once.
---
In the same boat brother, getting x1 3* for every 3 or 4 my friends get, usually they take pity on me ;)
---
I know, but one of the inside the vault articles said they were working on new pvp mode which many suspect to be a faction based pvp. So I'm seeing what it's like in othaler games. 
---
It’s so well earned though, people are on the warpath because someone (me) eye rolled the thought of a digital thing getting wiped because someone else abused a program, and it crashed. I guess I forgot the caveat “don’t try this while the servers are lagged”? All you chuds can gfy.
---
Can u compare with the normal Tesla Rifle and check if it does increased dmg ? Or if it’s the same aswell.
---
I just don't want to be associated with dupers. And I think that people who do trading with dupers are as guilty to this situation as the dupers.
---
Currently the highest a weapon can have is 4, either having 3 stars and a player adding scorched killer to a gun or sacrificial blade to a machete.
---
No mate - I came to Reddit to moan like crazy to a community who almost convinced me not to buy it. I am genuinely pissed off with the nay-sayers. Almost cost me a decent game. 
---
And I haven't seen one proper actual point yet. Feel free to comb this thread and link one, I may have missed it. But almost everything I have seen has either been patched away or is simply a "didn't get the Fallout they wanted". 
---
I mean - be honest with me here. Are you playing a game different to the one Bethesda promised you? If so, how so? 
---
Genuinely asking you. 
---
Because since buying it, I have rewatched some reviews and I literally just laughed. They are all full of shit and praying on your upset to earn £££. Couldn't be more obvious. 
---
I think the biggest real complaint I have seen so far is either the "No NPCs" one or the "You can cheese power armour by relogging". 
---
Both complaints come with a "lol thats shit" attached to them.
---
As for the actual game, based on what its supposed to be.....I am literally playing the exact game I thought it would be. So either I am smarter than the majority or the majority are on a bandwagon. 
---
And since I am not that smart, I am going with "bandwagon". haha
---
I understand how a lot of people can feel like these duped tod tier weapons can ruin the game. But the dev's are going to increase the level capbarent they? We do have 2 other empty slots for legendary effects. Wouldn't raising the level cap 25 levels and adding just one more potential legendary while adding kn level 125+ enemies effectively render the TSE that are level 45-50 mostly useless? 
---
I played neverwinter back when they did their wipe for the astral diamonds thing. It was not fun losing all that time spent legit farming. They punished all players for the actions of some. I'm okay with losing a couple of weapons or whatever but not all my progress in level and stuff.
---
Black cowboy hat on the wheelchair in the back hallway of bottom floor of Whitesprings Clubhouse
---
Couple here! Hubby and I have been playing the game together since BETA. We love the exploring and environment storytelling.  We get into long discussions about why this or that happened, what this or that building and facility was used for pre-war and post-war, and we make long backstories for our characters.  
---
You might be thinking of queen of the hunt where you check out three spots for cryptids. 
---
Nice short story ernest hemmingway. 
---
Armor pen's pretty hit and miss across the board and particularly buggy with energy weapons.
---
The other possibility is that your test target just didn't have any actual armour to be a noticeable shift. I don't know what all has what armour (or how it scales if it all. HP does, but I'm not sure about armour). 
---
But if you're firing at something with 10 armour and cut half of it, its only the difference between 5 and 10 armour. Whereas if your test target has 80 armour, thats going to be a much more noticable difference cutting 40 off.
---
Damn I wear that all day long it is badass.  Beth should hire you to make PA skins for the Atom stop. That son would sell well at 500 atoms.
---
This is beautiful! 
---
I use the flags as curtains in my camp on the top half of my windows and would def love to see some faction based flags too
---
I've been getting more disconnects with the government shutdown.

In case you need specifics.  It’s a brutal hunt for the area cosmetics.  
---
Shit, I've been all over that place, I need to dig harder.
---
Not a glitch. Happens after a nuke zone disappears if no one clears out the ghouls left behind.
---
I went from 1 hitting most enemies that aren’t scorchbeast or assaultrons to it happening every 1:100 so I think I can agree with this, because I never had an issue until the most recent update 
---
We don't really know how it would work. But if it makes Factions mean at least *something*, I will be happy.
---
My friend and I recently launched a nuke, I think Charlie silo. I disconnected twice and each friend once. When coming back into the server we each had to go through finding the blank card to get through the laser grid each time with all enemies respawning and being a bigger pain to deal with alone.
---
I was taking a break for a few weeks to play smash bros and was a little meh about coming back. Very disappointed in the constant disconnects and it just made me want to quit. Luckily in all of that one of us finally launched the nuke and at least it triggered the mission complete for each of us. Even though the mission objectives reset each time.
---
It's the little things like that which make me not so keen on playing anymore. Although I am on this subreddit for some reason and I am thinking about hopping on tonight lol. Even with all of the issues the game is still fun when it works.
---
I did read that we are supposed to be getting a global chat or server chat system in the future though. I would love for a chat box like Warframe has with all the different tabs for trade, LFG, etc.
---
I have seen this glitch as well its cancer the server me an my friend were on kept lagging and these two low levels were hanging with this 100+ lvl i went over there ajd fought them an killed em all they had absurd amounts of gear
---
Youre in the controversial section but this is a legitimate issue late game. 
---
Anything but the whitespring legendary grind. That shit is not fun and frankly the weapons I get i don't really get excited over in the same way. Right now I'm 110, I have some lower levels I travel with to help with their quests. I'm still discovering every location on the map, looking for illustrations of buildings with no discovered location. Making sure I've captured every workshop once because I still don't have all plans. Scrapped my house and tried to build a more realistic post apocalyptic home. 
---
Working towards long term rewards from Monster Mash, Lode Baring, and Mr. Fuzzy events. Each rewards some sort of token essentially, you can save up for cooler rewards. Still trying to get the Ancient Blade from Breech and Clear as well. 
---
We have the same agreement. We don't do any quests or go to any cool locations we haven't been yet unless we do it together, so we can experience it for the first time together. 
---
I have a regular one, the explosive version definately hits harder, but if they are too close, it just goes right through them and explodes on the other side.
---
Your title made me spit take and I'm not even drinking. Lol
---
Few hundred hours and I've never seen one. Killed like 5 mothmen though
---
So no pre-nup required?
---
I'd give her a TSE shotgun so she'd just stop
---
I mean i've raked up 5600 atoms just by playing a few weeks.

Gta online too. Horrible.

Make sure you pay your "supply taxes" to the brotherhood for "protection"
---
Oxhorn ran into 4 queens at once the other day

---
Odd, someone nuked it over the weekend and the wave of mobs outside the northern gates (north of the vendor and chemistry station) from the railroad tracks over to the second gate respawned several times.  Saw a number of 2 and 3 star.
---
There was also a wave of ghouls outside the southern gates.  I found the inside of the town to be a waste of tme moving through it.
---
Also the power substation to the NW (?) had mobs.
---
That's just it matey. I am playing the exact game I was promised by Bethesda. I appreciate I missed some of the bugs....but as it stands, it's exactly what I expected. 
---
To buy something, get exactly what you was expecting then to give it a bad review speaks more to the intellect of people, not to the condition of the game. Know what I mean?
---
It's like giving football (soccer) a bad review because you can't physically slam another play to the floor in a tackle. You fucking knew that going into the game.....surely?
---
I don't pay shit for my privately setup ARK server. I can put mods on it and adjust settings however I want, and even setup a server for Xbox I'm pretty sure, so not sure what you're talking about there. If you're renting a server then that's the only way you're paying a fee for it.
---
Imagine if it crashed twitter.
---
Inventory price for a pipe pistol, 30 caps.  Take it to a vender, they trade you 2 caps.    
---
Just because inventory price shown, that doesn't make it the actual price you get back.    
---
I have no clue what I need other than steel, spring and adhesive.  I had to transfer 200 pounds of junk to my melee character because I can't sell it all.
---
The King was about four quests back. At the end of the ultracite mine/lab after you follow the Operation Touchdown signals.
---
Easy to miss maybe, cause it is kind of chaotic in there.
---
I remember that collapsing a petrified corpse would consistently hard-lock the PS4, which no other game I’ve ever played had managed before. :)
---
I don’t use normal armour, my character is built using only power armour so I just have a shit load of spare ballistic fibre
---
I saw that once and by the time I was ready to go it had gone. Maybe I'll do it if all those blasted gutsys that take off 10% health every gun shot don't kill me again. 
---
It blows my mind that a high level deathclaw damage can be dealt with but a stupid robit just plinking away ignores even power armor and just chunks away.
---
It might be.
---
Truly said vault dweller
---
Pretty much my thinking.
---
Ah fair enough. Public workshops are PUBLIC meaning they are there for everyone who is on that server. It stays as is until the entire server resets 
---
Exactly. Those that bought the game on release got a game that was, as you said:
---
&gt;&gt;same game loop. Same play style. Same game.
---
We paid $60 for that. 
---
You paid 10ish. 
---
And you wonder why we might be disappointed and you’re all chipper? 
---
For real, the map is huge. Each area must be the size of a normal fallout map.
---
Oh, that sound counterplay maybe i was wrong but then there is 1 little thing. Price difference you can get two shot lever action for 6k caps and i bet that armor setup isnt cheap
---
Well that is the straw that breaks the camel's back for me. I can't play like this anymore. 
---
My wife and I play as well. Most of our sessions play out eerily similar to our grocery store trips.  
---
My wife is carefully and purposefully and systematically exploring and scrounging an area while I just wander around with no real purpose but to explore and cause trouble.  The usual results is her picking a lock while I come running by with a train of super mutants.  
---
This followed by her quip, "I leave you alone for one minute!"
---
Guess I was an outlier then, it was rock solid for me the first couple days.
---
PC 
---
My husband shot some mannequins, and they duplicated, it was rather unnerving but not game breaking. They would only make a second not multitudes. Thought it was unusual enough to tell about.
---
Right I don’t know how much armor they have. I tried lvl 50 Gusty, lvl 68 super mutants and scorched. And a lvl 40 bee boss. However I want to point out the two shoot did the same amount of dmg as the other versions of it... should it had an increased dmg ? 
---
Jeeeez that's a lot of stuff, thanks friends! 
---
I'd like to think I'm an understanding gamer. I knew what I was signing up for when I bought the game. It wasn't nearly as bad as most said.
---
That's the thing. It doesn't need to be co-op. Similar to Borderlands it's just an option.
---
Although, it has to fit the storyline though.. Like Fallout 4 could never be a co-op due to single-parent-searching-for-it's-only-child storyline. But it might fit a New Vegas storyline and Fallout 1 as well
---
Maybe a AAA publisher that charges £50 a game and makes, in profit, hundreds of millions should actually work for their money rather then releasing an embarrassment such as this.
---
Before the internet, when games shipped on DVD's they had to be working when they went gold. They had to have Beta testers and pay them. They had to pay for the DVD's and cases they shipped in.
---
Now without all those costs, they save millions and charge the same and have a much bigger audience and became way more lazy (and not just Bethesda). Now they churn out an utterly crap product unfit for purpose because of the bugs.
---
Mush of the rest of the game works pretty well even though the story suffers but it has some good points but to ship it like this? From a AAA developer? 
---
That's like going to a Gordon Ramsey restaraunt and getting a school dinner cook doing your meal. Imagine if Gordon Ramsey was in charge of Fallout 76 and the devs gave him what we have LMAO.
---
Basically bethesda is getting the game mechanics smooth first, then they will get busy on content.  I am pretty sure it is a placeholder feature, 5 stars will come, as will more furniture, areas, vaults, etc.  
---
Ah ha - perfect comment. 
---
So this begs the very real question:
---
Is the game shit? Or do you simply feel over-charged? 
---
I can pay too much for a Coke-Cola at a restaurant, doesn't make Coke-Cola shit. 
---
PS4
---
The flamer isn't necessary, it was only on my last run i used it and found it helped but you can just smash them with anything.
---
Nope, but I do love it when I have a fully decked out workshop to claim.
---
I explained that.  But since you skimmed and missed it, I'll say again.
---
&gt;  But lets face it, BGS fucked up with this potentially amazing game. If we're going to give them a second chance to make this game great, they need to give everyone else a second chance too. In addition to the loud and public policy about draconic bans for exploiters, it might encourage people to give the game a second chance, and actually play nice. The game needs players, that's all there is to it. Give those banned a second chance
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it were just due to conflicting with their interests.  Atom shop items as many know could be placed in a friend's camp.  They patched that out pretty quickly.  Probably because they'd loose sales.
---
Now if you had a combined camp, imagine it'd load in if either one of you were online.  One person could be online and their camp would have atom shop items from the other person.  It's not as big an issue if you just built one in another's camp but it's still a conflict.
---
**leans in**
---
*Show me.*
---
sadly, it still require ID card. you may have to contact Bethesda or try other methods to get the card.
---
Agree with the possibility of a an armor reduction bug ? 
---
For you?  No.  For the majority of the gaming community, it most certainly does.
---
Very high and mighty of you, sir. I hope you enjoy your tower! 
---
I think I spend way too much time on reddit, because I knew from the start that OP likes fantasy stories and has been playing this game for at least 2 months.
---
Could be anything in this buggy dumpster fire of a game
---
What is the purpose of one player levelling a camp, raking up a huge bounty and then jumping out of his PA to get executed without defense by his (way lower level) companion?  
---
Cap transfer?
---
You're idea be soundin good to me!
---
I'm pretty soar at Bethesda for making travelin merchant all buggy like dat.
---
Good on ya sir.  Good on ya.
---
They moved it to Tuesday, as I think they wanted to address a new issue introduced in the latest patch.
---
Which i'm glad they did. 
---
There have been several major patches since release and if you're just starting out you likely haven't gotten far enough in the game to start seeing/noticing some of the other annoying stuff that still exists. I just made a new character a few days ago and the beginning of the game is a lot smoother than it was the first time around and most other things haven't been a problem because my new character can't do/access those things yet. 
---
Some people just dont want to suck off bethesda endlessly. They are obviously exploiting their customer base and you think everyone should let it slide because its bethesda?
---
So a build built purely around this dynamic might not be super effective. Shame, that.
---
You can call me papa if you want.
---
Sounds like alot of speculation
---
Oh, yeah there's no reforming those people.  LOCK THEM UP, AND THROW AWAY THE KEY. You want back in? buy another copy BIZZAACH
---
LOL, it's weird to see the French version of the UI.
---
Je devrais changer la langue la prochaine fois que je vais jouer pour voir!
---
uhhhh, wut? 
---
Yes the pc patch. Not sure how it’s affected empath but supposedly herd mentality is fixed as well
---
I didn't but was on a server that had someone nuke it and yes, there's a fuck ton of flux just over the cliff and surrounding it. I managed to get close to 50 flux without even trying. 
---
Done
---
I appear offline quite a lot to dodge my old Destiny team lol
---
“Want” is wrong, *no offense intended* I was Uncaring of their stuff disappearing because, A: it’s just stuff in a video game that has some problems and B: there are more hour plus sessions for every whiner and downvoter I’ve met here, just dead drop the inventory at that time rather than when it’s about to crash. Again, IT TAKES TWO MINUTES people. Wtf.
---
Aside from the obvious bullshittery that most of the people dumping inventory are somehow involved in the server crashes, I honestly couldn’t see why everyone was so pissed. I’ve got three letter swear contractions for every situation, and it rarely blows back like that. (Salty children gonna salt I suppose, really shouldn’t claim the high ground on that one).
---
Just replace mainframe cores and moving forward
---
For real, have you met people?
---
Found a few of these guys. First one bugged out teleporting everywhere and died, disappearing into nothingness. The second I killed and got some really crappy loot. The third one kept buffing the scorched beasts and other adds that about kicked my ass. That last one was a fight for life itself.
---
I think I still have the 2nd one recorded.
---
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of a rollback?
---
In December only had one disconnect.  
---
In the last week alone, 6 times. Something fishy going on. 
---
How’d you get that picture on the top I want to do something similar but I don’t know how (I’m new to Reddit)
---
Seriously, though. Editing. It's your friend.
---
You're wrong on a major point.  I actually LOVE fallout 76.  The problem is that the vast majority of the gaming community doesn't.  I have no personal grudge against BGS and they don't owe me anything.  I enjoy playing FO76 with my friends, and just wish I could play with more people.
---
I am not a grammar nazi, but "roofs"  gets on my nerves every time I see it in build mode.
---
At least it was your own doing and not getting disconnected
---
Thanks for the reply! I'll just leave it as there's other ways in. If Bethesday try to fix it they'll just screw something else up for everyone LOL
---
*eye twitch*
---
Ah sweet, thanks! Nice pic man, sweet af!
---
I went there last night on route to doing the freestates quests and didn't see a sloth. Plenty of gulpers, anglers and scorch though
---
hell yes
---
I got lucky and had to fight simultaneously, the Flatwoods monster, SB and scorched near ski resort.
---
I didn’t know if he was friend or foe, but when I realized I was taking damage from him, yeah he was a bad guy. Lolz
---
Tbh, there was so much shooting I couldn’t tell who was the target.
---
Never knew they were so rare, I seen 2 in a span of maybe 10 minutes once and haven't seen one since. How do you kill it though? It just teleported away from me.
---
Idea, he was just ment to be a living crash dummy, but told he was sent to earth to be the Decider.
---
I really just want to find one honestly. Awesome post and thanks for the info friendo. I hope to see you out there in the wastes of Appalachia !
---
They just cut out the middle part. Rather than show all the manufacturing it would take, they just go from gun to junk to new gun for the sake of gameplay. No one would probably play this game if you had to physically play a mini game to smelt your junk and then repurpose it.  It’s like editing a movie and removing the less interesting parts. It’s implied. 
---
&gt; I mean - be honest with me here. Are you playing a game different to the one Bethesda promised you? If so, how so? 
---
[I already posted my thoughts on the game in your thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/afuje2/just_picked_up_fo76_with_a_friend_over_the/ee1vizk/). But to answer your specific question; 
---
Bethesda promised the community a multiplayer fallout experience. What I got, in my eyes, is a fallout-themed multiplayer experience. I genuinely do miss having a hub city area with NPCs walking around, conversing and interacting with each other. We don't have that in Fallout. Having 32 players maximum on one gigantic map also doesn't replace having random NPC encounters while out exploring, like finding a roaming trader or a random event (like this specific event in fallout 4, where you encounter two identical people claiming the other is a synth).  
---
It is, in my opinion, Fallout, but also not really Fallout. It has a Fallout world, Fallout gameplay, and a Fallout theme, but the world also feels less dynamic and more dead with the lack of interesting NPCs or story characters. And i'll be honest, if I didn't start replaying the main quests on a second character (i wanted to try out a different build), I probably would've forgotten what the main story was even about. 
---
&gt; I think the biggest real complaint I have seen so far is either the "No NPCs" 
---
To be fair this is a pretty valid complaint  
---
&gt; "You can cheese power armour by relogging" 
---
I still don't even know what that means, or how that's a 'complaint'. Power armour isn't even usable until you hit level 25 anyways so it doesn't matter much, and you can't get X-01 armour out in the open world anyways, and you can't get power armour mods from scrapping power armour parts, so what's the point?  
---
That's certainly one way to look at it.  But I think (and again my whole piece is an opinion) that if you want to redeem the game in people's eyes, a bit of contrition, combined with a hand ready to drop the ban hammer, would go a long way.
---
That sounds like something a duper would say...🤔
---
But seriously, if I was on ps4 it take you up on that offer. 
---
As am I, I’ll be keeping an eye out for those plans 
---
Not many dude. I'm at the Airport, have a CAMP built near first town. I have to go meet the Mayor now in another town. So that starter bunch of quests really. 
---
I'd estimate around 10 hours in - so admittedly, not far. 
---
It all has to do with the influencers trying to 'make money' reporting on things to try and make people upset, to pull them in and make them wanna see what other fuck up has happened is pretty old school when it comes to how to get recurrent views, that's why they ONLY report on the 'outrage' of the few, instead of the views of the many.
---
OWG (Open World Games) is at least pretty impartial, he calls out the bad but also talks about all the good being done by Bethesda, check him out some time if your looking for a more reliable source of info.
---
I guess the explosive stat is working properly. Let’s wait and see if someone else can check armor reduction and the two shoot.
---
Im fine with all TES weapons being wiped and players having there whole inventory wiped for having a ridiculous amount of carry weight and straight bans for the people who have been duplicating patch after patch. But, don't touch levels and stuff for the majority as most of the items besides TES have no balancing issues.
---
"Melee weapons are breaking too fast"  hehe
---
I am so smart, S-M-R-T
---
Yeah that's a real concern. I did have some dropped frames in one building I was exploring. Is that a common thing? 
---
I like both, but I like that 4LC only has to hit to process, whereas Psychopath needs a kill. I’m running them both, but I’ve only maxed 4LC. Need to find room for Tormentor myself so I may have to choose to exclude something.
---
If on ps4 then yeah otherwise our paths may never meet.
---
Gah never apologize to the mob and people that aren’t even playing the game. I’m so tired of this mentality that people need to grovel and ask forgiveness like they killed your fucking dog or something. It’s a fucking video game, if it sucks move on. People act like they spent their fucking life savings on it and it’s literally the only game they’ll be able to play or something. Just chalk it up to experience and move on. You don’t want an apology, you want acknowledgment for whatever perceived slight you think has been perpetrated against you and that that should grant you power over someone else. 
---
I saw one of these the other day but just for a moment and then it teleported. I was only level 15 and wasn't really near flatwood. 
---
Shiet i had a camp out near the top of the world near the cliff that hangs over and i had fog crawlers spawn there all yhe time. I would try hangin out around there 
---
Military sites. National Isolated Satellite Array is a treasure trove of useful junk, including ballistic fibre. If you haven’t discovered it yet, look at your map. It’s the satellite dish in the middle of the Savage Divide.
---
Once you get it you cant live without it!
---
Hipsters finding exploits? Lol, most of them were found in beta.  That's what beta is.  They were just never bothered to be fixed in time. You clearly have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
---
Cheers buddy! 
---
Don’t know how you guys continue to play this absolute trash heap of a game. It’s like you’re in an abusive relationship but you keep coming back for more
---
They dont need to need them. I think making the demolishen expert perk not effect TSE weapons would bring a good balance because melee weapons can also do 2000+ Dmg and we dont want melee to be the only viable option like it was in the beginning.
---
I think its less like having a 100% chance, but having 2 50% chances. So it'll be common that you get revived, but you wont be able to for another minute.
---
It's actually got significantly worse for me. At release of get the odd D/C but since Xmas I've been getting probably 5 blues screens and 10 D/C a day. Saturday morning I had 3 blue screens in an hour
---
Consider yourselves lucky mine thinks video games are childish and stupid, &amp; she cant stand when I talk about fallout even tho I love it 
---
message sent :)
---
Oh yeah, it's incredibly annoying. But I'm more pissed about Bethesda's response to the problem than anything. Making excuses that don't make sense, passing the problem to other people, and essentially ignoring problems and hoping they go away on their own.
---
I'm salty over the Pumpkin house "Daily" I am a grenadier build and I have been able to do that daily exactly once. I have never since had it pop in 300+ hours of play.
---
No idea what triggers these and they shouldn't reset just because you log off.
---
Heck, I still get the "you can't fast travel while there are enemies nearby." bug from ES4: Oblivion
---
All that, and awnings.  Definitely awnings.
---
The fluxes are still used in crafting ultracite ammo 
---
It starts tracking correctly for anything you do post the patch is my experience, not retroactively applied.  So you need to relearn those recipes, probably on another character.
---
It's not about as much about the apology, it's about PR.  It's about BGS trying to reclaim some of the cache they had before FO76
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but the ignore 50% armour legendary refers to ballistic weapons only. Having it on an energy weapon is next to useless unless they fix it soon. But as others have stated, the tesla rifle is all sorts of messed up. In fact, all energy weapons are messed up. 
---
The exact same youtubers said RDR2 online was bad because of the microtransactions. They are being objective when they say the launch was a mess. I've played at least 60 hours and the game is laggy and constantly disconnects. It's so strange that you can let a company insult customers, actually leak MY personal information, try to say an overpriced microtransaction is on sale when it isn't, lie about the way the game is and then act as if you aren't entirely emotionally driven when you call these youtubers clickbaiters.
---
I've encountered them in the hills between the Big Bend tunnels, there's an area where there's a chance a Mothman, a Deathclaw, or Flatwoods monster will spawn.
---
Xbox X
---
Was after guy with a large bounty. Realized I was not killing them even when they were on one hp and shooting them three times afterwards. They admitted to using a glitch that gave the essentially god mod. So a few hundred caps lost haha :(
---
On another note improving their customer support would be helpful given it's a huge indicator on how the developer views the players.
---
you can craft t-60 and t-51b the plans are from events in cranberry bog or treasure maps
---
Nope, just have an understanding that most video games aren't perfect.
---
it teleports around you, but you can still kill it.
---
You guys got the game for cheap and after some of the bugs have been fixed. Also after a while you realize there’s nothing to this game except the grind
---
If you paid too much for a Coke-Cola, you went to a shitty restaurant that is run by assholes. So it’s a shit-transaction. So your point is more demanding of bethesda than the product.
---
How much you pay impacts the value of what you got. That’s literally the relationship you’re indicating when you say how good something is. It’s how good it was in relation to what it cost you. 
---
And then there’s the messaging: what if you were told you were gonna get a brand new, special kind of coke? And because this was a new, specially made coke, it will cost more than a normal coke. But then you get it, and it’s just a normal coke with a different colored label. How happy would you be with this? I mean, it’s still a perfectly good coke. Why are you complaining?? Coke is great!! 
---
Same situation here. I was told there would be a new fallout game. I love fallout games. So i paid for a new fallout game.  But what I got was a reskin of a 3-year old game I already have, but with a poorly implemented multiplayer system and quests that were ham-fisted into the “no npc’s” angle. 
---
If I wanted to play Fallout 4, I’d play Fallout 4 with quests and npcs and random encounters and a world that reacts to my decisions. 
---
There's nothing in your post that indicates you like the game. At all. 
---
The very fact that you think they need to apologize to all the gamers out there, shows what you really think.
---
You think you are the most important type of customer for games. That everything should be done as you expect, as you want, and what you think should be in a game.
---
All your suggestions are nothing more than saying, Make this Game like Every Other game. Because all I want is more of the same.
---
So I can't see how you love fo76 when you want it to be just like every other game. 
---
If you just want to get rid of the burden, put it in the suitcase at Watoga train station, I dump my plans and ammo in the blue suitcase right next to the vendor or the lunch pail right next to that. People will find them.
---
Good point, it certainly would be helpful.
---
Had her. Wasn't great.
---
For all the naysayers about power user, I'll put a comparison vid up so people can decide themselves, but there is a huge drain on cores without it.. 
---
That's true I should have included that
---
Too bad they treat that dress as armor. Would have been better if it was just treated like any other outfit.
---
yep, thats it!
---
first time i did it i found flatwoods monster
---
the impressions of someone apprently not using any melee related perk cards
---
Hey, I dont know ehat wad causing it.  Just that ladt night was different.
---
And if it worka on pc, someone coyld in theort be testing it on consoles.
---
It seems like they’ll do it even if you have something *positive* to say. 
---
My impression is that this game has become so polarized that most of the people on here simply react with outrage as soon as they see an opinion they disagree with. Hell, it seems like most people don’t even read past the title before upvoting/downvoting.
---
I two-shot a glowing queen in a nuke zone yesterday. You’ll get there :).
---
Am using a 1-shot explosive double barrel shotty (a legit drop) with 5* Demolition Expert perk. 
---
Probably a fix to stop people going into the dev room
---
What's wrong with the techncial data?
---
Lever action rifle animation and bobby pins weight were actually also very vocally called upon by the community. what is your point ?
---
It took me a very long time before I found one, and then the bastard teleported away as soon as I tried to get close.
---
Were you using blueprints? I was building mine from the storage so I don't need the supplies
---
&gt; Private servers do not fit the monetisation model of this game
---
"Oh, this thing they could charge for that people want, and are used to paying extra for?  I don't see how we could possibly monetize that."
---
Gotta google that one. Smh. 
---
Le plus difficile va être de de réapprendre tous les termes du jeux .
---
So the bugs are part of the game and instead of fixing them we should learn to play around them? What kind of argument is this? Everybody "having a cry" is upset about the bugs and instability.
---
Same. I am back at around 2200 atoms again, waiting (I don't check challenges and just come upon them naturally). 
---
best bet is make an alt and go there again with a friend, it won't take much time. enclave bunker is kind of a big deal....
---
Bethesda uses save points for the server and also the player. To cut costs of high end servers they do interval saves you can see this when you get disconnected from the server. They should save the player when anything in their inventory changes but they didn’t because they’re cheap
---
Who the fuck uses Conan as some sort of evidence that proves a point across a multi-billion-dollar industry?  Conan doesn't set any standards for games.
---
Ah, gotcha... yeah, I don't know anything about that, don't really play pvp games personally.
---
It was just a lame joke. I was blazed went I wrote it, no offends! 😜
---
The broomstick was just a double barrel shotgun and the chainsaw is in the game. close enough
---
A buddy of mine is part of a fb group thats pretty big and they trade and sell a lot. Huge levels. I bought a tse dragon and a tse shotgun + 3 melee weapons that were all 3* and it all cost less than 800 caps.  Some of the guys on there started setting nukes off yesterday and have around 1000 codes to launch b4 the new update drops. Xb1
---
I played fallout from the beginning, I still have their cds.
---
The struggle for me is, the lore historically is you’re the lone wanderer, out in the scary world.
---
Fallout 76 isn’t about you anymore. You and others from your vault,  are entrusted to remake the world given the tools provided.
---
The problem is, THE OTHERS.. lolz
---
Not everyone plays the same or has the same idea.
---
So, while you’re hacking and slashing the environment to build a camp, you’re fighting, SBs, scorched, muties, monsters, and griefers looking to profit from your mistakes.
---
That’s what I think the hate is on. Folks who want to play, but don’t want the drama.
---
My point about the power armour is I have seen a lot of complaints how you can get it too easily. Simply by running to spawn locations and relogging and repeating. Giving you power armour. 
---
When you say "whats the issue anyways?" because it requires level etc, thats exactly what I said!!!! So same page on that one. 
---
The NPC's one....I'm sorry but agree to disagree. Most NPC's just say "hey" when you interact anyways. The only ones who don't  would be quest givers and shops. 
---
Well, we still have shops. And yesterday a few guys roamed into my base and I have plenty to chat about with them. I even tasked one to gather wood for me and I'd pay him caps! Soooooo, he got a quest and he got a reward. 
---
The "lack of NPCs" isn't a technical failure. They could add them tomorrow if they wanted. It isn't something they left out because it was too hard. It was a choice to make it that way. So it remained as empty feeling as all other FO games. 
---
If given the choice between running into an NPC who I can sell junk to for 28 caps....or meeting real people for a chat. I will always pick real people. Know what I mean? 
---
Don't get me wrong - when I hit level 50+ like you have, I may feel the same as you. But there is no way you hit level 50+ without at least enjoying yourself. Because if you seriously spent that long levelling, on a game you hate, I'd question your sanity :P 
---
Can confirm I’ve been playing the game as intended. I hit whitesprings when I see it, and I’ll stick around for a respawn or two, but I’m not server hopping for nuke zones. 
---
I just play a lot. 
---
You just put links in what your writing and it appears when you post it, the image that appears on mine is the first imigur link I put in
---
Best part tbh 
---
I found one but it teleported away after shooting it. Like it was gone gone.
---
Ultracite ammo really isn't worth the hassle, I don't find it beneficial enough to warrant the extra work anyway.
---
My man and I play when he feels like it, but usually he's on Destiny.  He's lvl 15 and my sister and I are in the 50s, so it usually ends up as us body-guarding him.  Makes it kinda interesting having someone you have to worry about keeping safe from lvl 50+ mobs as he runs hapazardly through the wasteland collecting ALL THE THINGS (He's a hoarder)
---
also used to make fusion cores and decontamination shower
---
Nice baitclick trolling attempt.
---
I'd pay $5-10 a month for access to a private server.  I will pay $0 a month on Atom shop items.
---
I have injured myself so many times jumping off cliffs since I lost it, I keep forgetting.
---
Damn, that is nice looking! My first thought before I looked was the robot suit that Nixon wears in futurama. 
---
Ah, so this is what kept happening to me and my husband last night.  We ended up giving up trying to play.  
---
Bit of a bummer that corpses don't drop their clothing like they used to.
---
The game is good ,but its not without its faults. It's normal, it will be corrected. Anyone expecting it to be a fallout 5 should have known better from the start, it was never meant to be a FO5.
---
I like it for what it is and i realistically recognize the potential to it like increased building capacity, better performance, stability, more things to do, more decoration, more storage and perhaps perk cards.
---
I have had plenty of fun in the game, and i probably will have a lot more fun in the future too. 
---
Some of the glitches in the game i just find charming, shows that its real people behind the studio too, and some of the glitches like stretched bodies and necks of zombies brings out some extra hilarity to it all. Also the power-armor bod that i believe they may have fixed now. 
---
The only biggest frustration about the game so far has been the dissassembly of mods in storage even if you had sufficient materials. Lost so many expensive cap mods. And also the fact that the cap trade is a bit shit with vendors, that you only get to buy back like 20% of the caps you give to the vendor through trade. You should be able to trade a bit like in other fallout, where item value can pay for item value
---
Damn my curiosity is cured, thing still looks creepy in the distance!
---
It's a poorly executed mmo of FO4, that still has a lot of bugs and issues that were fixed by the community and not Bethesda.
---
Servers crash and you can not rejoin old servers were you may have died and lost all of you junk loot. Duping is still rampant and abused. The pvp system is easy to troll and abuse, or bypass. There is no end game. Development was rushed. If this was still in beta I would find these issues acceptable. Loot boxes are on their way despite head execs saying publicly it will never happen. Lying to those that bought the nuka cola bottles, and the packages with the canvas bag editions of the game.
---
Honestly if they'd give refunds I wouldn't be here. Until they do I plan to point out all the problems. There are a lot of people unhappy with this new Bethesda. I find it embarrassing I purchased this game. Of course I've done this so much now that the mods of this sub are restricting my commenting. Seems either it's run by fanboi's or paid members of Bethesda, who don't like negative opinions.
---
Serendipity, last laugh, nuke mines, life saving armor,sentinel/vanguard armor. Try to use a shotgun with +50% limb damage on the opponent's legs so they can't get close
---
I would assume it would be tied to events. Like a king of the hill style event for claiming things for factions. Inside the event it is open pvp against people of other factions or maybe those without one. Or maybe we still have the regular faction events like we do now but people from other factions can come in and fight you and interrupt. This is just speculation on possibilities 
---
Tried playing the other night for the first time in a few weeks. Logged on, was immediately disconnected after my game loaded. Loaded up again, played for an hour and completed a daily quest. Just as I turned it in I was disconnected again. Game locked up during the loading screen which required I restart my computer. Launched the game again and found that my daily quest progress had been completely missed by the server. 
---
I'm on PC if that helps. Also, I saw people standing in groups of three on the map shortly before this disconnect happened each time.
---
Not nearly as common as it used to be. Some areas were almost unplayable on release. Whitesprings is probably still bad near the resort depending how many robots spawn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHsQqGs0zvY
---
Thanks :D
---
Damn must be a lot more rare. Damn eyebot
---
You lost me in you first paragraph - I have a pistol vats toon who does just fine without TS or Explosive and pistol is supposed to be the weakest.  You are over exaggerating how weak you are.  With that build and a non legendary weapon you can solo 99% of the game.
---
Any reason you're such a dickhead?
---
It's such a disgrace when the community has to satisfy the needs of the playerbase because the company that made and manages the game can't
---
That's pretty cool. I hope they add this in a DLC or even just put it in the Atomic Shop. I would buy it if the price was fair tho
---
Yes! It’s all been said! I don’t need to rehash everything each time someone new buys the game. 
---
Posts that complain about/bring issues to light post-patch or praise the game post patch for fixes are fine. 
---
Please provide a picture of the evidence.
---
even though im part of a raider group i dont raid im a shopkeeper i sell wares and i good also be your factions shopkeeper as well i will cut deals for y'all and supply you with necessary gear if needed also if you send the noobs my way i can get them going with gear  
---
Why would you take time writing something you know is going to be hated
---
Someone nuked Top of the World last night. Helped me get the Cobalt I needed but still seemed pretty worthless. Saw maybe 6 high level scorched and a lv 30 radscorpion but that was it.
---
I was hoping for some creative opinion on gameplay mechanics once the bugs are solved. 1/10 useless wall of text.
---
Clearly a god
---
They nerfed my knuckles, I am not very badass anymore. 
---
i seem to be very bad at getting EA to work. do you just remain completely stationary and stand and crouch back down? even with chameleon armor it seems like i always remain in danger. am i moving too much are you supposed to go and hide somewhere and then crouch? what exactly is the most effective technique? 
---
As far as I'm concerned, they have to be using some sort of in game DDoS, as in doing something in game that sends so much information at once(repeatedly) that it causes the server to crash. I say this because game servers have DDoS protection from outside sources.

I found mine in the world, I forget where, I didn't know they removed them.

There's some info on here refering to anti armour halving DR specifically where energy weapons deal with ER. I would think until they patch it anti-armour won't work with any legendaries. 
---
you would be correct, its taken a lot trading to get the armor to where it is, but thats more a general pvp counterplay. Dense+fireproof still takes the explosive damage way down (about 90% from people testing it on themselves) so you really only need to pay to have somebody mod your chest piece.
---
If no one was complaining do you think bethesda would be fixing things? The whole canvas bag thing is proof they won't do anything unless they have to. They didnt even bother supporting different screen resolutions until we all complained. Consumers are allowed to have a voice, people not complaining about FIFA loud enough is why the series is where its at today.
---
And you can still enjoy the game, I have fun on it but I hate how bad it is. I want it to be better so I complain.
---
Yeah I do and I got a lvl 35 mutant slayers explosive gauss rifle for you too. Add me Chunk8bacon. I be on and off all day
---
&gt; How about the fact that I took all the time to write up this opinion piece?
---
LOL! That's not proof you love the game! That's typical entitlement privledge attitude that allows you to think that because you had a thought it must be right and the only logical view anyone could have.
---
Again, typical gamer that thinks everything should be done in according to him.

User's data breach
---
I was about to say that it could work in 4 if the players played the father and mother but then I remembered that Shaun gets taken from his dead mother's hands. 
---
NV would work pretty well, Co-op would be awesome there, especially in the Dead Money DLC. It would hopefully make the Villa a tad less of a nightmare
---
This is why I have no desire to come back.
---
This was the first nuke zone I visited outside of the two usual spots. 
---
Absolute waste of time IMO. Nothing spawned, and everything that was there before was killed by the nuke.
---
Not sure about flux though, I don't think I saw anything but Im not sure. 
---
It's been like that for nearly all bethesda games, unofficial patches fixing every bug because BGS just stop providing support after launch.
---
I couldn't agree more. I'm a parent and I don't get to play a whole lot. The other night I had a few hours to play and was psyched. After the lengthy loading screen my game immediately disconnected. I tried again, played for 45 minutes and nearly completed a daily quest. As I was turning it in the game disconnected again. I launched it, loaded, and found that my daily progress had been completely reset. Decided to play a game that would actually save my progress and quit to go through my Steam library.
---
I love the game play when it works, but I'll be damned if FO76 doesn't try harder than any other game to keep me from playing it. Disconnects AND failing to save my character's state on a supposed MMO? It's ridiculous. 
---
You are a hero
---
The files for it are already in the game my friend. 
---
[Someone data-mined the pc version and got it into FO4.](https://m.imgur.com/ac7HpOP) it’s kind of a shame as I much prefer your concept as this one just looks bland.
---
Hopefully they are trying to remain low profile on the issue and are gathering Intel and creating a way to punish all of them at once in some kind of future update or maintenance
---
Glad to hear. Not holding enjoying the game against anyone. ^_^
---
Lol, I mean, hell, I loved Fallout Tactics. (you begin judging me now).
---
I'm just super dissapointed in Bethesda for how they handled this one. 
---
The Two Shot version of the Tesla is only doing as much damage as a regular single shot; you can check the stats and they don't change to accompany the additional shot. This is also the same with the Broadsider and the Plasma Gatling. They all behave as just regular one shot weapons and is therefore a bug that should be fixed with the patch that comes after the incoming one.
---
ça devrait ne pas être compliqué je pense, y'a pas grand chose au final
---
There's a lot subjective and inaccurate advice being flung around here, so here is the actual math.
---
All armor ignore effects are multiplicative so it doesn't matter how they're ordered:
---
X•(1-A)•(1-B)•(1-C)...  
---
X•0.25•0.5 = 0.125X *Or in other words 87.5% armor is ignored.*
---
Because of how the [damage formula](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance) works, each source of armor ignore always gives the same amount of increased damage. There are no diminishing or increasing returns, it is always linear with the one exception that if you are already dealing so much damage that the target's resistance is completely negated (DamageCoeff &gt; 0.99) you can't actually deal more than your paper doll damage.
---
Source | AP | Damage increase
---
---|---|----
---
Melee AP mod (any) | 15% | 6.1%
---
Gun AP magazine (two affects) | 20% | 8.5%
---
Tank Killer perk | 36% | 17.7%
---
Gun AP magazine (one affect) | 40% | 20.6%
---
Anti-Armor legendary affix | 50% | 28.9%
---
Incisor perk | 75% | 66.1%
---
Co-op fallout is wishful thinking at best. How many hours do you sink into the average fallout game? Now imagine trying to consistently sync up your play time with someone else and think about how much longer that would take. Don't get me wrong, I would play co-op fallout if I had all the time in the world and a buddy who could drop whatever he's doing at any moment for a solid 3-4 hours. 
---
The rollback is the servers way of fixing itself. Kind of like when you call IT and they ask if you've rebooted. 
---
Well pre war cash is basically useless in 76 anyway unless you want a shit ton if cloth
---
He’s right...they get hurt and you should never land in jail. His honor is respectable, but it ruins the game for the rest of us. Yes, you will get no respect, but that’s beside the point as long as you make the game better for the rest of us.
---
I think most people and "reviewers" gets disapontment and bad game confused when it comes to this title. Like you say, it's fallout online. the problem is that Bethesda chose to release it at least half a year to early, without fixing things that have been fixed multiple times by moders. Had this been an indie game it would have been great, but we expect so much more of bethesda and rightly so. This in its current state should have been released as a ~25€/$ expansion to fallout 4
---
Anyway, I enjoy it as well and allready lookimg forward to next login, but I'm still disappointed with a lot of Bethesdas decisions.
---
Yah no kiddin. With all the disconnects and lag and dup drama and griefing that I somehow seem to run into, hubby and I have just been wishing and hoping they'd fast track the private server stuff.
---
Mutation serums, craft your own for use and extras to sell.
---
That bitch wrecked The Castle, what do you think.
---
I went back five days later and everything had respawned. It just took time to let things reset.
---
If what works on PC? So far there's been exactly zero evidence posted anywhere online of what this threads OP is claiming 
---
Works for me even while moving. I don't wear armor though and my agility is high. 
---
I've been a hanger-on for a while. "Don't play if you don't like". Well these disconnects have made me put my money where my mouth is, I stopped playing. 
---
I would guess the dev room thing and, if rumors are true, the new dupping trick
---
Right my two shoot Gatling plasmas doest have the increased dmg compared to no effect one! Can u check the amor reduction and see if they are not working too ?
---
This game desperately needs dedicated free item bins. I end up just dropping stuff when I run out vendor caps.
---
Or they need fix how crappy drops and npc economy are.
---
Or what? You really think a lack or groveling apology is going to stop people from buying ES6 or Starfield or whatever else they come out with next? Come on. The apology is about power and “sticking it to the man”, you and others want a notch on your belt and the feeling of power, no matter how small it is. 
---
Saving some items for the future, DLC, etc
---
I have a shit-ton of cloth lol, want a vault-tec jumpsuit?
---
Nope. Stash remains independent through the marriage. Either player can initiate divorce at any time by moving CAMP.
---
I just reached level 19, and put almost everything I found till now into melee, but from the perks you named I only got martial artist, I think this is a little bit a disadvantage of the new perk system that as a beginner (and without searching for them on the net) there is no way to know what perks are possible ...
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
yeah i know ill never see it again.  kind of furious that when i see something so rare the game bugs out in a specific way ive never ever seen before. 1 spawn for a super rare plan in nearly 3 months of playing and the game glitches.
---
I'm right there with you, friend. Something that seems really weird to me: so many of the "hated" aspects of FO76 were endearing in the previous games, or are altogether ignored in other games. Also interminably strange to me--the sheer number of people posting videos (hating on the game) that clearly show they've played for at least a hundred hours. Why continue to do something so unnecessary (like play FO76) that you claim to hate so much? 
---
Now prepare for the automatic downvotes--how dare you have a different opinion!?!
---
I just wanted to chime in on how funny it is that the big bad is the ol' video game cliche of a bat, [a goddamned bat](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats) (tv tropes warning.) One of the most played out, all time annoying, creatively bankrupt enemies you could possibly add to a game. Makes me sad face.
---
I have my fingers crossed on a patch for the duping-related disconnects. 
---
That was long for 5 points , some of which have already happened. 
---
Bethesda has already began lower AS prices. Simply compare the recent holiday bundles. 
---
And listen to the community? Why do you think there was that price drop. Also, if you read patch notes you'll notice they often patch things that are regularly demanded by the community. 
---
The heavy weapons fix, attempting to fix duping etc...
---
Also you really think exploiters who are making real money give a fuck about any of this? You think if Bethesda "fixes" the game they'll suddenly have a change of heart and not do it any more?
---
Hahahahaha.
---
Ban the fuck out of em
---
Those cases are few and far between so it is effective for the mast majority of enemies.  Then again with how strong the current meta weapons are it just amounts to a larger amount of overkill damage.  
---
Yeah. The hate train is the cool thing to do. All the cool people are doing it. If you don't hate this game you'll never be cool or get upvotes. What a loser.
---
Ps: Glad you like the game, it really is awesome.
---
yep!   The husband and I play together, that lucky  fucker found a TSE shot gun, so now it's mostly him carrying my pathetic ass around Appalachia.  
---
I was ahead of him for a while, but then went on a trip for a week, and have been trailing ever since.  
---
We do nuke zones together, my shotgun has a pretty high chance to cripple limbs, so i run in, and break all the glowing ones legs, and then he fires a few shots with his exploding shotgun to finish the pile off.  It's a good mix.
---
&gt;Also, why would you unban the scammers lol.
---
I bet he got banned and all the other stuff is to hide the fact he's trying to get back in the game. 
---
I HOARD TOO HAHAH..Leave a man and his junk alone !! 😂😂 
---
I play with my best friend, I guess you could call us a couple :)
---
So you're speculating that out of 20 or so players on every server, 3 of them know this new dupe method?  On every server? That's alot of people that are aware of this glitch. Or they just have crappy programming and servers. Which HAS been proven.
---
Well its kind of evened out since they are bugged and can't hit flying scorchbeasts lol.
---
Its Fallout4: Online, they dont really need to change gameplay mechanics, they need to fix the other issues holding the game back and then focus on content.
---
So that's what that was. I had a rollback this weekend for the first time. Now I know why. 
---
I dont know why people cant criticize this game and still play and enjoy it. Its so strange. Like I love Fallout 3, so I guess the gunplay is now actually perfect and not clunky at all.
---
Everyone on here acts like they owe bethesda. Its a multimillion dollar company, they don't care if you drop dead tomorrow, they owe YOU a product you paid for.
---
the vendors inventory disappeared until some badly lagging player left the area and then the bot reset its inv. Ive never once seen a vendors inv reset without relogging.
---
I got those plans last night. I’m also on PS4. I had enough of server hoping and decided to take over a few workbenches because plans can be rewards for claiming and defending.
---
I got the barn set after defending the Charleston Junk Yard for the second time. 
---
I also got the warehouse set in the same session along with lots of other camp plans. 
---
You don’t get armor buff and pa buff at the same time 
---
Agreed but could you imagine if someone had looted them all just before you got there so all you see is a bunch of naked dead ppl! 
---
Harambe loves 76
---
The Two Shot is the only one worth keeping so you can use it in a couple levels. The rest should be sold to vendors or scrapped. If the Bunker Buster was level 50 and you were going heavy gunner with 3 ranks of Bear Arms and 5 ranks of Explosive then I would keep it. At level 20 though, I would sell it.
---
There's a behemoth in an unmarked pond just west of the Twin Lakes.
---
I'm guessing your reply got deleted by the mods, but I can still see it on your profile. Everyone should go look it. Really puts your opinions in perspective.
---
I see now, apparently energy weapons do not work with that armor reduction stat. They need to make it work ! Or remove that crap from the legendary pool table!. 
---
It’s the moments together with a person you care and love that count!

Strafe around her and try to take out the legs.  The important part is to always keep moving to the side to dodge that massive poison.
---
Armor pen helps alot.
---
Bullshit. Get off you gaming high horse.
---
And stop trying to get your dupping self unbanned. That's what this is really about? 
---
Can you collect it too?
---
I encountered a level 50 or something one on my first character at a level of 6. Not knowing what it was, I ran in the other direction for my life after it nearly one shot me 
---
The stun is the main reason to take it. It's helpfull when 20 ghouls corner you.

Does one have an extra stripe?  From what I know of military, its all about that stripe, i also don't know much about military.
---
It is **partially** implemented, but maybe Bethesda has to finish that in an update? Currently, you can hover over the chassis, and it creates a pop-up menu with the "specs" of the chassis... HOWEVER, it is all zero'd out. Hopefully there will be something in a near future patch, that can **at least** calculate the stats!!
---
not sure if you're joking, but the c and i should switch places
---
I figured there was something to it, i’m just short of 300 hours and only in the last 20-30 or so have i been losing the server more than twice, and the two times per playsesh are usually because i overload the game trying to organize my stash- which makes me think any stash increases are far off because that’s usually the only problem, i used to think hovering on the edge of blast zones would do it, where you confuse the game running back and forth— but when i spawn in-no nukes active,  and lose the server back to the xbone home page on a few different times while considering you can get thrown back onto the same server after you lose it, itd only make sense theres people doing something that would kick the server. What torture! Fucks my ritual up for sure.
---
can xbox and ps4 players even use any sort of mods?
---
if not, that stinks.

I'm good, I have enough love to counteract you hate. Coexist brother.

There's a purifier there? I didn't know that.
---
Of course they need to change mechanics. character progression beyond lv50, gear progression, perk cards system... it all needs a long hard look.
---
I've never learned anything from scrapping PA. As far as I know, plans have to be either purchased or gotten as quest rewards.
---
Oh I don't mind at all, whenever I'm low on a given mat he always has my back!
---
He gets the best crafted armor and weapons for his level in return, too.
---
I also enjoy exploring.... glad you’re having a good time too.
---
Personally I can’t play super frequently, maybe once or twice a week if I’m lucky (especially over the holidays) possibly, as a result so many of the issues that I hear about I haven’t seen. I do appreciate reading about the exploits and dupe issues here, to keep up to date.
---
I have played the BETA and other than a few players being jerks, a misunderstanding (which resulted in a friendly few hours of play with a higher level new buddy) and some hilarious body-glitches with my brother I have been enjoying Fallout. Disconnects happen, and I just jump back on.
---
I hope you keep having fun. Thanks for the post from a new players perspective.
---
I check the weapons at white springs and Watoga vendors a lot because of this. Never found anything I wanted but there are often a lot of legendary items there. 
---
huh, i always thought they were designed to be shared for everyone, and that everyone got their own loot from them. 
---
I wonder if this was intentional, I didn't see any mention in the patch notes!
---
Hines said that all private servers will be run by Bethesda. “you could have your own private server hosted by us.” I’m 90% they’re gonna charge for it.
---
Yes it was a joke i spelled it Techncial
---
Haha that’s awesome. 
---
Will add ya!
---
Launched
---
I bet you 10k atoms, if you fill the whole server with people that aren't duping, it will still crash.
---
That right there is a power duo! 
---
"Do you really not understand that your experience might differ from that of others?"
---
...pots, kettles, and all that jazz...
---
Can you post a photo of this?
---
go to a weapons bench to apply mods
---
Why would that be a secret? That location is a major focus of questing for a while, everyone learns it.
---
Yeah, it's amazing how he wants to be fair, and how much BGS needs to get on their knees and beg for forgiveness, and give all the duppers and exploiters a second chance (probably he got banned).
---
But doesn't care at all what this would do to all the honest players that don't have a rod up their gaming butt like this guy does. 
---
This guys post is so selfish.
---
I downvoted because I read cancerous 🙄
---
There's another SMG (45 ammo) that uses those mods. I think.
---
The one you displayed only says SMG Reflex, not 10mm reflex.
---
Agreed either make it work or give energy weapons thier own ER reducing perk. 
---
So they're lying? About what?
---
I'm convinced that if you have uncooked mothman eggs in your inventory, your chances of seeing the mothman go up a bit
---
A friend and I have launched several nukes now and we think it keeps getting bugged for us. Maybe you or someone can confirm? 
---
Specifically the last part when you initiate the bots to come out and you have to protect them... Are there supposed to be hordes of robots coming to attack? all we ever get is a few mr. gutsies or something and it is super easy. 
---
It takes us probably 30 minutes to launch the nuke at the most. 
---
I've killed quite a few crowned ones, but it wasn't an easy fight. When she hits you with that poison spit.. watch out!
---
I agree completely.  
---
Finally someone exhibits a speck of intelligence, its about time.  Its so easy to throw around accusations of duping/other exploitation.  Someone saying they have picture evidence means absolutely nothing.  There is simply no way to prove, without recorded dialogue, exactly what someone’s actions were.  Just because someone comes on here to shame another person and report them for actions that may or may not have been exploits does not mean we all need to give in to the polarization and upvote the hell out of it.  I would like to see this so called evidence.  It sounds like you may have the right intentions, but are ultimately jumping to conclusions.  Frankly, it is time to let Bethesda do what they will do.  continuing to complain about it and filling places like reddit with accusatory posts (without REAL evidence) will get us nothing.  I am sick and tired of people playing hero here.  It is great to combat the issues of exploiters, but trying to be a vigilante, stalking others because they had a fancy hat, or blowing up a base simply because there happened to be more than one player in it is crazy and promotes an atmosphere as toxic as one that encourages duping.  At this point, things are too corrupt to be able to conclusively determine a player’s legitimacy.  Unless voice recordings are provided explicitly linking a player to a crime are produced (and even those can be faked in order to gain notoriety on reddit), I hesitate to jump on any bandwagon promoting hate towards another player.
---
I dont want to attack OP’s position or legitimacy, but there are some red flags here that have been popping up all over this subreddit
---
Done hundreds of workshops and never got them. Finally bought them from Grahm
---
And I disconnect....arg 
---
Ironically it's an NPC like automated response
---
When I found the level 3 fireproof and dence mod the tse at close range game changed for me. Shotguns at point blank will still nearly kill me but the rest besides thr gausse is tickle damage.
---
It should detail the pieces of armor that are equipped on it
---
All scorchbeasts should drop a 1 star legendary in my opinion.
---
That way you can expect something decent for dealing with there annoying sonic booms.
---
Textures already in the game. Here it is ported into [Fallout 4](https://i.imgur.com/ac7HpOP.jpg). There are a lot of details lost on it due to the texture differences in F4 vs 76. Items that will likely be shiny, embossed logos, etc. Just found out how to do custom textures into 76 so will try getting in game to get a better look.
---
For sure! When I get home tonight I’ll

Make a photo guide.
---
It sounds complicated but it’s super easy.
---
I don’t know how to record on my PS4 so the best I can do is screenshots 
---
You apply it at a bench, and you have to have the proper gunsmith lvled perk (if it requires one)
---
Not right now. If bethesda ever allows mods to happen (which they said they would in the future) then it will be at the discretion of the modders of whether we get any or not. But going off of FO4 I would say it is very likely that we will get mods on console at some point
---
Yeah at first I definitely just thought "wow this is a Fallout MMO without a subscription model, sweet" and went with it. Now I'm just waiting for the newest dupe method to get patched so servers aren't crashing every 20 or so minutes...
---
Some are rare.... I saw Flatwoods Monster once. I shot it and it teleported away. I saw one Mothman, which was level 1, down by Harper's Ferry. I kind of saw a megasloth, but it got killed by a yao guai and it's body was all twisted and glitched into the ground. I haven't seen any behemoths... I did get attacked by four fog crawlers once, oddly down near Welch. I used to party with a hermit crab all the time though. I set up a camp near the road by Abbie's bunker and every time I traveled back to it there was a hermit crab on the road that would aggro me.
---
Some monsters are just incredibly rare and I like that. It makes finding one feel special.
---
I could probably do with seeing a few less wendigos and snalleygasters though....
---
So I have read in here, and seems to be true, that the max number of water does not increase with the number of purifiers, but the speed of it does
---
Dont know what the max is, but say its 10. If you have 1 purifier it will fill to 10 and stop, if you have 5 purifiers they will fill to 2 each and stop. Etc
---
But if I kill random ghoul at a golf club with one hit from a sledge hammer it could drop the best loot in the game. It is very counter intuitive.
---
Because I think this discussion needs a proper display of the intellect you're working with, lets' see what you replied, eh?
---
**&gt;&gt; (removed the initial insult so it wouldn't trigger mods)** Mincing peoples words in the internet is just the lowest form of intellect. You know exactly what I meant mate.
---
I love this part:
---
\&gt;&gt; \*I haven't read the rest of your post because it started with such fucking dribble.\*
---
But one more time for the idiots: "Are you upset you paid £50? Would the game suddenly be 'good' if you only paid £10"?
---
That's my point and you knew it, didn't you? So instead of "trying to win a fight on reddit", converse properly. Surely you could have worked out that's what I meant? You aren't that stupid, nobody is.
---
I'm gonna explain this to my 4yr old niece to see if she gets the point.
---
"Hehe what you said is X and and blah blah blah, so YOU MEANT THIS...hahaha...is that what you intended? Do I win now?"
---
Total idiot mate. That's baffled me that has. How can anybody be that deliberately stupid.
---
how'd you get her to lie down?
---
I think playing middle-man and charging for the servers is exactly what they’ll do. Pete Hines all but confirmed it by saying “you could have your own private server hosted by us.”
---
Well let's not forget, that they did it this way to make the Nuka Dark look as close to identical irl as it did in the game, they wouldn't have been able to do that with a traditional glass bottle to begin with, and all the nubby bits on it would have made packaging/shipping it a pain in the ass as they'd have given the bottle weak points
---
Also: from how Silver Screen responded to things with a post on their FAQ, it seems like it was there call on the plastic shell method, more than Bethesdas.
---
We had working relationship with the brotherhood once, I’d like to see it restored. 
---
Your brotherhood lost as many, maybe more men and women to the unforgiving wastes... and you had military training and a far better arsenal. We need each other.
---
Can someone confirm the problem with Gatling gun too ?
---
This. "Submachine gun" is the .45 cal weapon.
---
Is there a list with locations of them all? 
---
Responder is most train stations
---
Raider is a couple of Train Stations
---
Whitesprings
---
BOS in Watoga Shopping center
---
Free States at Harper's Ferry
---
Enclave under Whitesprings 
---
What one am I missing? 
---
I usually log out as quickly as possible when something happens and I DON'T want it to save. (Like someone blowing up my base, for example.) I don't know how saving works, but I would be careful just how quickly you log out.
---
You can make all the Ballistic Fiber you'll ever need by taking and defending workshops.  
---
Take a workshop, collect the reward. You'll have to defend it almost immediately for another reward. Don't bother building, just move on to take and defend another. Repeat until the game crashes or you disconnect.
---
We have been dumping stuff in that ice cooler for a while.  You should also always check the cash registers at the vendors.  Many people dump plans and ammo there.
---
Well.. that's a bit disturbing. Good job.
---
Look around the space station, in one of the other sections (close to the big wheel) you can find a code to pen the locked section, there are some goodies inside for you. :)
---
Level 35 and I’ve never seen the flag woods monster or moth man I feel left out :(
---
At this point, there should almost be a sticky post on all the FO76 subreddits that reads:
---
"Beware: any comments that suggest FO76 is remotely enjoyable WILL be downvoted. If you have the slightest care in the world for your Reddit Karma score, DO NOT make positive comments."
---
I think it's more that this post has been made a few times already, plus Bethesda already responded to as well.
---
More damage is more damage in the end.
---
I got a prime tse handmade just for the queen.
---
I want to know  now if someone can confirm the Gatling gun prob. 
---
There is not a bounty bug, but there is a bobble head glitch that allows players to become OP. Also if a team mate accidentally initiated pvp, the whole team suffers. Also if one of you decide to seek revenge it will carry to everyone in the group and allow you to be killed as well. 
---
It not a problem if you let the servers catchup. Craft 20-30 then pause for a few seconds before you craft more. 
---
oh wow, so I was accurate with it being black at least, but yea a bit bland :l
---
Yes. I'm always in favour of more enclave armors
---
Nah, it's more boring than that. You can just craft the 4'th and 5'th star with some boring mods.
---
There is one of the regular little eye bots that spawns there some times, it’s not a vendor. 
---
Oh thank you! Much appreciated

I've dropped them on the dead person outside Vault 76 that starts off the quest.  Giving some newbies a little extra advantage.

Lol, I just noticed that as well. It's the mobster tommy gun style.

I've not see it yet either. I finally saw and beat a Mothman the other day. It didn't even glitch after I killed it. 
---
Abbies Bunker is where I tend to see them. Usually they glitch on me.

---
Ugh sorry to hear it. Try opening a ticket and see if they'll reset the quest. You will probably have to ask a dozen times. 
---
I paint only my main PA I use with Atomic ship paint that makes it distinguishable from the other PA in my stash.
---
I guess that makes sense, but since neither of us initiated the combat we can still lose caps either way? I guess that was my concern because I lost like 1500 caps yesterday and was like wth. lol
---
Obligatory American Dad reference and I love it. Take the karma!
---
Useful info thank you 
---
I remember the days when everyone on COD banged my mom.
---
Oh, the responder bot? I thought he was saying the protectron vendor turned into an eye bot. 
---
Okay thanks 
---
Wow! That's a surprise, Bethesda isn't really known for having free DLCs in Fallout. 
---
Although, I winder if that means that they'll be more minor than the pretty big map expansions we had in previous games...
---
I just don;t understand why that feature wasn't added in the first place! I've wasted SOOOO many CAPS buying duplicate plans. The worst part is that you can't even sell them back to the vendor!
---
if its a 5/15/25 etc, level 45 is the highest it can go
---
It also works with vats melee builds. 
---
That must be where I am getting my supply from!
---
I have been wondering about this.
---
I'm just guessing...but surely big game companies spend so much money on marketing and getting feedback from fans, surely there are departments of the company which have a few people employed whose job it is, at least at times, to scan the biggest of the social networks and message boards and look for genuine stuff like this? Is it not one of the only ways to get the raw opinions? Wouldn't they pretty much have to if they want to keep up to date with game exploits?
---
I bet a hell of a lot more people have complained about bugs on reddit than have contacted Bethesda about them. That leads me to believe that it's worth developers keeping an eye out themselves.
---
Right? Makes sense, but the other briefcase is a mystery. Pretty cool that the DLCs will be free unlike other Fallouts. I hope that doesn't mean they'll be smaller though...
---
I ran into this at Whitesprings last night. Kept getting a sound effect that I was taking damage but my health wasn't going down and no one was around me. Next thing you know I'm dead. Respawn and it starts happening again but I notice I turned wanted somehow, get killed again. The whole time I'm trying to figure out wtf is happening when my friend said a player was crouched and attacking me. I couldn't see or target him. Apparently he was using my Reactive Armor mod (reflect melee) to sneakily force me into being wanted/killable. 
---
The anti dupers have the same mentality as the brotherhood. Shoot first ask questions later
---
This has happened to me a few times, and doing a "Scan and Repair" on the game from the Bethesda client fixes it for me.  In my experience it takes 15-20 minutes, and it downloads a couple hundred MB of files to repair it each time.
---
Are they still taking servers down for "hotfixes?" That's not how a hotfix is supposed to work
---
&gt;\*I haven't read the rest of your post because it started with such fucking dribble.\*  
---
&gt; instead of "trying to win a fight on reddit", converse properly. 
---
Just a reminder, your reply to me included both of these sentences used un-ironically.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, I present the logic of @Kohana55
---
Gun Runner just gives a flat +20% buff to your base movement speed, as long as a pistol is equipped. The pistol doesn't need to be drawn to get the buff, just equipped.
---
&gt; My point about the power armour is I have seen a lot of complaints how you can get it too easily. Simply by running to spawn locations and relogging and repeating. Giving you power armour. When you say "whats the issue anyways?" because it requires level etc, thats exactly what I said!!!! So same page on that one.  
---
I still don't get how this is a complaint, because you can literally craft two sets of power armour (one for doing a quest at level 25, which is when you can start wearing PA, and one near the endgame), one of which is the best set in the game stat-wise. Picking parts off a world spawn frame doesn't sound useful at all, so I don't really know why you're making such a big deal out of it.  
---
&gt; The NPC's one....I'm sorry but agree to disagree. Most NPC's just say "hey" when you interact anyways. The only ones who don't would be quest givers and shops.  
---
Quest givers, shop owners, companions, and faction-related human enemies in general. I've already said why I think NPCs are an essential part of previous Fallout titles so I won't retread that ground. But having humans present, at least in the form of Raiders, would have been interesting. Instead all we get is named 'Raider' or 'Settler' corpses that don't look like they could have been left for longer than a few weeks.  
---
&gt; Well, we still have shops.  
---
Ah yes, the shops around the map that are locked to one of the seven factions available, that all have extremely overpriced items even with a max rank bargain perk, that also have a cap limit of 200 meaning you can't really trade back and forth with them; you gotta wait 24 hours for their caps to reset.  
---
&gt;  And yesterday a few guys roamed into my base and I have plenty to chat about with them. I even tasked one to gather wood for me and I'd pay him caps! Soooooo, he got a quest and he got a reward.
---
I've played for more than 200 hours at this point and i've never experienced anything remotely like other players trying to give out quests. Silly gimmick interactions sure (guys hiding in toilets asking for toilet paper, creepy clown stalkers, etc), but nothing like that. Outside of that rare encounter, a lot of player vendor stuff is kinda lame. 90% of the market right now is legendary or plan trading, with some people trading materials on the side. 
---
&gt; The "lack of NPCs" isn't a technical failure. They could add them tomorrow if they wanted. It isn't something they left out because it was too hard. It was a choice to make it that way. So it remained as empty feeling as all other FO games.  
---
Of course it's not a technical failure, I never said it was, and of course they could just add them in. I'm not saying that they can't. I'm saying that this design specifically is what makes the world feel so lifeless to me. I can list off so many noteworthy characters from Fallout 3, Fallout NV, and Fallout 4, but I can't remember one NPC name from Fallout 76 besides 'The Overseer', but that's not really even a name, more or less a title.  
---
&gt; Don't get me wrong - when I hit level 50+ like you have, I may feel the same as you. But there is no way you hit level 50+ without at least enjoying yourself. Because if you seriously spent that long levelling, on a game you hate, I'd question your sanity :P  
---
I've never once said that I didn't enjoy myself. I said, in my other post, that I stopped enjoying myself at level 64. I had highs and lows of enjoyment throughout the game (most of the highs were from the very beginning of the game in the level range from 1-20, and the very end from 45-50).
---
I would like you to at least consider how you've actually gotten the game, and then consider everyone else around you. You paid £9 for the game several months after it has launched. Most of the community has been around since around launch, and has paid between half price to full price for the title. The game has been floundering between bugfix after bugfix with more exploits popping up after each major patch to subvert the previous exploit that was fixed by the last patch. Add onto that a myriad of small problems that people have with the game (being unable to have a perk deck 'loadout', in the sense that people could rapidly swap between a set of perk cards meant for combat or a set of perk cards meant for crafting without having to manually switch each and every card, or having certain perks like the lockpicking or terminal hacking perks be active at all times in order to pick high level locks or hack high level terminals), as well as the aggressive pricing some of the Atom Shop items (this started ramping up around the Christmas season, with a few skins costing around $10-20 USD) combined with the lack of ways to reliably earn Atoms after you've gone through the easier non-repeatable atom-earning challenges. Look at it from that point of view and you'll see why some people are at least a little jaded with how F76 has been handled. 
---
So get rid of Bear Arms and limit the use of a lot of iconic fallout weapons to just 1 playstyle? 
---
Nice one. Thanks!
---
I found a lot of level 50 legendaries when I wasn’t level 50 yet. But it wasn’t till I was level 50 before I started finding the really powerful and rare weapons
---
Oh no. I always suspected this day would come. I think the only solution is to ban all and enemies, that way we can be sure there are no dupers.
---
That’s very kind of you! This community is great! I don’t have voice chat but my in game name is TerranKi. I’ll be happy to trade you any extra plans or anything you need! Thanks!
---
My bad, I thought they monetized it by fucking selling it to me for sixty fucking dollars.
---
If you expose their names on reddit you will be band for maybe a week 
---
Yeah I have the same problem. Get caught by enemies, sprint a good distance away until I break line of sight, go back into stealth and... I remain in [DANGER] until they swarm me like thirty seconds later. This is with camo armor and 15 AGI.
---
i have 15 agi and max sneak. cannot seem to get back into caution. will keep experimenting. 
---
Lol. Most people don’t know the IT definition. 
---
I meant in the build mode.
---
Solo: 33. Died once. Used a ton of Stimpaks. Wasn’t worth the resources 
---
One time, I claimed the dirt track when it was unowned, but the prior owner left behind the most impressive defensive works I had ever seen. Turrets galore, including missile turrets and spot lights. I claimed the workshop, and when the super-mutant hordes arrived, I just tagged each with a pistol shot for xp, before the defenses dropped destruction upon them.   
---
For something like 50-bottlecaps to claim the workshop, I jumped from level 14 to 15 in just a few minutes. I was glad to benefit from the prior owner's  departure from the server. I just wished I could have shared a thank-you note. 
---
What defines "broke as fuck"? Game is usually fine for me
---
No.   
---
First of all, you don't really need legendaries on lower levels, unless you really wanna try some special build. Second, the legendaries scale with your current level. If you grind on a lower level, you will need to grind all over again when you are level 50, where the level of equipments is capped.  
---
I suggest you only start grinding when you are level 45+.
---
I have had the same experience. The Workshop water purifiers make water at the rate it says (60 per hour), camp purifiers are capped at a much lower rate.
---
Stuff that is 5/15/25/etc max at 45 and stuff that's 10/20/30 max at 50.
---
Quest rewards scale to your level. If you're 50 or up the All Rise will be 50, same with other quests.
---
This sounds like someone trying to get people off the backs of the duppers because they are one themselves, or buy from them.
---
If you enter it, they will assign you an automatic ban.  So, you might want to reconsider ever learning of that.
---
Items that are 5's cap at 45.
---
As to quest rewards, my experience is the they will drop at their highest level (45 or 50) once you are level 50+.
---
It's a common factor in most games with a MMO element to it,take ARK for example
---
You had to cause a rollback to start the dupe
---
Thanks for actually giving an actual answer 👍
---
My buddy was with me on Discord and warned me about it, since he did the same thing. Was glad he was online. 
---
Yes. You lose caps every time you’re killed by another player. If you seek revenge you actually will lose more caps. It can get annoying but some pvp tips. If you crouch you will not be displayed on the map. This also means trying to wear gear that blends in with what is around you and hiding in something as simple as a bush. Or you could always block them and they can’t see your place on the map which allows you to go back to enjoying the game. I tend to end up in pvp a lot (Usually my own fault) but these are just a few things I’ve learned. 
---
Yeah fire axes for example only go up to 45
---
The rewards will drop at a level appropriate to your character at the time of quest completion.
---
Solo: \~30 at fort defiance when doing the brotherhood quest with the help of a rocket turret or sth
---
You will find out when you reach end game or try building elaborate camps. 
---
They can make a world of difference.
---
My alt is vats/rifle with no pa but i used pa to level. I got a lvl 35 instigating/power attack baseball bat.
---
With no str perks i could 1 shot level 68 ghouls in whitespring due to that legendary.
---
I leveled to 50 fast
---
Same went for New Vegas, most of the assets already existed from fallout 3, and it didn't have the added change of adding in a functional multiplayer, client/server system into an engine for the first time
---
Gone now?
---
I discovered that along with the Responder Bot spawnable event, there is a Responder Eyebot that will sometimes spawn.  If you walk up to it and talk to it, it will scan you and indicate if you are wearing a Responder outfit or not.  If you aren't, it indicates no uniform detected, access denied.  If you are wearing a uniform, it will tell you access granted, and tell you if there are any alerts (events I guess? None occurring at the time) in the region.
---
Now that’s a power couple if I ever heard one ! My wife mostly melees, and I am a sniper build. She tanks and I stealth snipe the crippled! 
---
Dupers are definitely part of the issues but not all. 
---
How to get people off the backs of the dupers when they are part of the problems?
---
I can't see the bones in 3rd person, but they're blocking my view when crouched in first person. Pretty game breaking.
---
I mean here I am running away from them. 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/dr-cowlick/video/67295403
---
As soon as you stop acting like they owe you something they fucking don’t so if ya don’t like there games don’t play em stop nagging like a Beaten ex girlfriend about them there are other fish in the sea kid 
---
My favorite is the weapon they’re using against you vs the one you loot. Got beat up by a very clear pitchfork, looted a Bowie knife. 😂
---
O wow. Getting some down votes here.
---
Be Fallout. Stop being millennial.
---
Fallout 76: Another nail in the coffin of objectivity!! 
---
Yes, it's buggy and frequently frustrating, all Fallout games of this style have been. Yes, there are things I would change were it my decision/ability to do so. While enjoyment is subjective (I am personally enjoying it over the 120 or so hours I've put into it), I firmly believe a lot of these naysayers are refusing to let themselves have fun. Nobody fakes outrage quite like a gamer. 
---
If you liked FO3, FNV, or FO4, there is enjoyable content here. If there's one thing in life I've learned in my years, it's to ignore all the noise and judge things for yourself. This is a skill seriously lacking in today's society. 
---
Maybe it will spawn a game that doesn’t drop servers every 30 minutes.  
---
nice!
---
His build is meelee/shotgun  
---
I do sniper / shotgun
---
Think for a second. 
---
I hate when some random person plays for a couple hours and posts a review of reviewers.
---
They also have a pistol when you kill them, but turn into a switchboard when you loot.
---
Is this some sort of Gun Blade?
---
Yeah, this seems to be the "best" option. It works ok, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason for it.
---
I love it! Nice job!
---
Just happens about an hour ago. Level 51. Over 200 hours in. My 2nd attempt. 
---
I am sorry to hear that man
---
Coolest theory yet. I hope it happens 
---
Sometimes just a slight deviation from the standard story is all ya need to open new doors. Right on. 
---
Platform? 
---
I enjoy this game. It's fun enough and I love playing Fallout with my buddies. But Bethesda put it out broken as hell. SOME OF US (glad you haven't experienced this shit yet, maybe you won't) get disconnected every five minutes or so, eventually just giving up. Some of us can't even play this game we shelled out 60 bucks for. Constantly disconnected. Constantly CRASHING. We sometimes can't team up with our mates (they'll show as offline when I am talking to them in discord and I know they are online) etc etc etc. I have a list as long as my... driveway. But it's the disconnects right now that are making us want to pull our hair out. And not in a cool cosplay sort of way like we were going to pretend we are from the wasteland. Like psychos that have had ENOUGH and can't TAKE IT ANYMORE so that's what some of us are going through right now /rant
---
I don't know what your problem is man.  I've never duped, im not banned, I could log in and play right now.
---
Lmao just play a better game 😂
---
Real talk: I hope they fix everything and improve the game mechanics.
---
man thats nice, got about 200 hours in and have yet to find an explosive gun. I wish rng would be better to me. the only time I find multiple star ledgendaries are on melee weapons and I don't need that.
---
Dang nvm I have Xbox 
---
&gt; Also: from how Silver Screen responded to things with a post on their FAQ, it seems like it was there call on the plastic shell method, more than Bethesdas.
---
Of course it was their call. They could've made a $200 package with an authentic glass bottle, but probably opted not to do that because it would've been pretty expensive for the size run of bottles they expected to sell.  
---
All in all, it was probably just a bad idea in the first place.  
---
The story isn't provided in an easier format. Rather it requires patience to read or listen to. Does not mix well with today's information age &amp; style of gaming.
---
Also frames. Or lack thereof. Not intentionally but from lag. Most likely the cause of dupers.
---
Pc, but it should be for all platform like how normal games would?
---
Yeah, lol. 
---
Nuke the behemoth for a 3 star glowing variant 
---
No, I am not banned, I never duped, cheated, or hacked.  I could log in and play right now.
---
Same. And I'm in the range for the fertile soil event. I'm often in my camp build/scrapping/ whatever and I get the reward for the event someone else completed. With this supply drop change it might be time for me to move.
---
You’re still an over entitled bratty gamer that thinks your Burt should be kissed by the gaming companies because you think you make or break games.
---
And you won’t log in because you hate the game. 
---
We are sick of people like you.
---
Again I'll believe it when I see proof posted until then this is no different then the "trade stealing" bs
---
Its a photo pose you can buy from the Atom shop.
---
The good ol `works on my machine`
---
My wife and I play FO76 together, in fact we don't do much solo at all and are both within a couple levels of each other (low 30s right now).  We try and one-up each other on CAMP builds, but otherwise we share a lot of resources.
---
We play a lot of games co-op together, we had just put in hundreds of hours into Monster Hunter before FO76 came along, and before that it was a lot of Destiny and Borderlands.  I'm assuming we will co-op with Anthem and try that out as well.
---
in the 20s at the munitions plant, it was the attacker when having to initially defend. Had the help if all my turrets and the built in turrets at the work shop + the vertbot. Ran around repairing everything then used all my ammo, had to finish it with my sword. It took a long time.
---
There is one spot where a behemoth spawns that i farm. SE of whitesprings in a pond by the mountains. 
---
Are they going to sell it properly, or in Polish way (to friends and family)?
---
As a fyi when you're building on a workshop The mats in green are from the workshop pool, white is your own mats
---
&gt; The story isn't provided in an easier format. Rather it requires patience to read or listen to
---
Even if you read or listen to it, it doesn't stand up well when you compare it to the story that other Fallout titles can provide. I'm not saying it isn't *interesting* per se, but it's pretty forgettable.
---
That is fucking sexy dude.  Will totally buy it.
---
No you just pulled that out of your ass
---
what?
---
Play it because you want to not because of others bro
---
Haha your grocery store visits!! That’s funny I love it. Mine is the same way, but I think she’s just as disorganized as I am with this game!
---
It is and they do. I actually know a guy that does it for Activision. I was being sarcastic, as the mods actively censoring posts and replies in this sub reddit. 
---
I am currently seeking a refund through my CC. I'm willing to bet if I get one and post how, it will get removed.
---
Good point. They also needed to figure out the container system and how looting stuff would work. The only thing on that side that annoys me is the FC generators sometimes being empty.
---
It's funny to me that kids go buy duplicated weapons, and then trash talk in game like they've accomplished some amazing feat by saving some caps and buying an op gun. On top of that, pvp in fallout is utter non sense. I refuse to participate in pvp that is so horrendously unbalanced 
---
YOUR RAMSAY REFERENCE IS PERFECT.
---
She's a bit strange and I don't really liked it that she wanted me to pet a deathclaw. 
---
How long will people keep figuring out how to play the game around Bethesda's shortcomings?
---
Just asking.  After a moderate paced run to 100, I can't be bothered.  I played after the update and while it was a huge step in the right direction, I claimed a workshop and DC'd 20 minutes later.  This and the lack of end game activities is enough for me to just not care.
---
I'm seriously curious, how long can Bethesda piece this quilt together before people just find a better blanket?
---
The plat proof pic doesn't necessarily follow it's you but congrats on flexin.
---
Wait until you get to the Top Of The World.
---
No, it is being discussed how to do the method in different discord servers from certain Youtube channels. That's how people are getting this info.
---
Are animation change mods even allowed? Or will they get you banned?
---
Not everyone did that. 
---
It's an online game, you have to consider others...
---
Yes, you have to enter the building. 
---
Was you tried at Nurmburg?
---
Thr code is 111418. Fo76 launch date fyi
---
I personally don't mind the PVP. Hell, I didn't mind that they orbital struck my base when I was on the other side of the map. It's another thing that I'm getting one-shotted by them and they kept hunting us and we kept losing caps. Now that I know you lose caps regardless it's more of a factor of whether I want to pvp or not.
---
Thats for the big fix patch for consoles, that pc already has. PC are getting another hotfix today
---
I’m not pretending. 
---
I only bought the game recently and I haven’t experienced any of the stuff these other guys have. 
---
But I did buy it a day after a major patch. So could just be luck I suppose. 
---
Other issues people have like “no NPCs” I find a bit strange. If I’m honest. 
---
Surely they knew this going in? I remember it being news before the game dropped anyways. Surely others must have? 
---
Not really lol, on any given server im in usually half or a quarter are less than level 10s
---
It's just so beautiful.
---
Yeah   
---
I'm 51 and all my gear is crap. Other players don't effect me. 
---
Here's an actual comment I just read on another post:  
---
&gt;Used to hunt down dupers. And you know how i do it? Whenever i see server not responding message on the bottom right screen, I open up the map and 80% of the time there's a duo or trio gathered up on some weird places you normally don't go to. You approach them and find out they are duping. ***Don't know how duping works***, but this is how duper hunt works. Server doesn't respond=dupers. This method doesn't work nowadays it seems tho. Server just crashes, giving me no time to respond. 
---
These people need to stop.
---
She was talking about a Mole Miner, though.
---
Banned for molding the game? Then have to write a letter to Bethesda explaing how bad modding is for MP game Ike it happened to some the other week. 
---
Agreed, however I had read that they only stay in the register for an hour before vanishing in to the great beyond, so wanted to help someone lucky enough to both see the message, and get there in time.
---
Basically I had like 10-15 fusion cores from 20 to 95% full but had just been farming at Poseidon Workshop and didn’t realise it had a fusion core generator! So logged off last night with 12 100% cores. 
---
Figured they might be useful for someone as they aren’t “worth” anything in caps. If only ammo could be sold or scrapped eh! 
---
Dont worry I too have never seen one 
---
Also one in Camden Park.  On the train tracks for the kids train ride
---
Haha a coders favourite line! 
---
If your (or anyone else's) camp is too close to the station it won't work.
---
This is the reason we want to hang two TVs in the bedroom. We went from just me playing in the living room, to him installing the ps4 in the bedroom for me (it got its own shelf and everything). To us wanting to move the living room TV to the bedroom as well and getting a (probably second hand) ps4 for that TV so we can play some things together. It’s such a shame there aren’t really any good couch coop games for the ps4. Our bedroom is 10 square meters so two TVs would be a whole lotta TV for such a small bedroom but playing fallout in bed is so chill so it’s worth it haha!
---
I hope not
---
It's extremely fun to see someone like you make a fool of yourself over the course of a few posts. 
---
Stealth seems way stronger than it was in 4. I can have a scorchbeast land next to me and not notice me even though I only have rank 2 of sneak and no chameleon armor in broad daylight. It was so close I could punch it if I wanted 
---
The first bit of dlc we should see will probably be going into the vaults since all of them have fleshed out interiors, some have enemies and working terminals. It seems like they might be instanced dungeons to run with your squad kind of like the dungeons in ESO
---
This weekend, we finally finished building my wife's first computer, and fired up 76 for the first time together. She's been playing on the PS4 since launch, and I've been on PC, so I started a second character with her. She's never played with a keyboard and mouse, so there's a bit of a learning curve for her with the controls. We've made it up through the Grafton quest line so far together, and are having a blast! Some highlights:
---
* A weak feral ghoul has been called every colorful word in her vocabulary as she learned the controls outside the vault. Said ghoul was eventually beaten to death bare-handed by both of us.
---
* Hysterical laughter from her as a random kitty waltzed over her frag mine. Apparently the ragdoll physics are wilder on PC, kitty is probably in the stratosphere by her guess.
---
* Me tossing "prank" grenades in her general direction, causing her to freeze up and crouch to see if she's been detected. 
---
* Her turning off pacifist mode and leaving the team while I went to pee, then trying to stab my character to death while they snoozed. Passive healing in a bed seems to out-heal a level 5 combat knife.
---
I was thinking about starting a new character and getting some xp in before the patch but I’m always so unlucky finding a nuked whitesprings.
---
Judge Dredd in a land with no law. I like it. 
---
Apparently they are shaming you, so, without further ado, SHAME! SHAME!
---
Glad you’re enjoying it bro! 😁
---
What others players do/have done won't affect you much.
---
I never grinded whitesprings, hasn't affected me at all.
---
I have been playing since the beta, I just play solo and do my own thing. I've taken 3 characters to lvl. 70, and I just keep rerolling because I enjoy lvls. 1-50 more than the endgame that currently exists
---
the damage should be the same for the player and enemies, but it is really negligible to players in power armor and high level mobs
---
I’ve had the exact same issue! My social menu worked totally fine in the Beta and maybe the first few days of launch. It’s been blank every since. 
---
Makes playing on a team very hard. Are your Emotes and game Icon resetting every time they do server downtime as wel?
---
Probably level 50. I just ran from them before that, took too much effort for such little reward. 
---
I just got a suppressed gauss rifle which is pretty good
---
I am sorry to hear that, sir. 
---
Whew.. a little agressive but I honestly agree lol. Good point to make for sure.
---
I don't think that a staggered release date would have done much. They wouldn't have found out about most of the duplication exploits if it wasn't for the community finding them (and STILL finding them) over the past few months. 
---
It could have maybe been a more polished product, but I have heavy doubts that most of F76's issues could've been fixed with a January 16th release date.
---
It's an equal distance between that and Sutton so I think it's okay
---
Find something better to do. 
---
That's one of the things I was wondering about, yeah. When you log out to avoid having your base destroyed, for example, are you logging out through the menu or are you hitting Alt+F4 or the like?
---
Don't grind purposely. If you do see a Legendary monster at your level range, by all means do go for it. You might find something good, at the least you'll get something that you can sell off for a few caps.
---
Exactly. If you have the caps to waste then go for it. Otherwise I would avoid it. I have 3 fairly maxed characters with plenty of caps. So it’s not a big deal for me if I lose caps. I will also let you know if you have 0 caps and try to pvp. When you die you get a debuff that makes you do -50% damage to players. 
---
that headline is a tough one to get through. 
---
Wait for PA paints to come out and use them on that + random camp stuff.
---
Unless you just devote yourself to 76, well, someone is always going to be more powered than you, whether by legitimate or illegitimate means. 
---
Save them for power armour skins, or some of the more decent looking camp items.
---
I will be sure to add you next time the both of us are on! It would make for one hell of a team. 
---
They go for 1.5k or 2k at most each lol
---
Please do. Im saving building on a spot until i literally find the best one. Could take days, weeks...
---
could do with some inspo before i get there!
---
God damn watching your projector meltdown is really entertaining.
---
Only things worth getting in the atom shop personally 
---
No problem i hope it helps, I'm not that good at explaining things lol
---
Which ever way the wind blows ya huh? Maybe ‘here, have some gifts’ or ‘hey f—- your camp’. 
---
I feel that. Right on. 
---
What do you like exactly? 
---
15k? your joking...
---
It sure does. I was on a server last night that dropped it there during the quest and it was quite fruitful. Lots of flux, I mean lots I could have probably gotten close to 100 if I kept looking but still left with close to 50. Tons of super mutants too wasn't too difficult considering my level 70 character. Lots of other higher levels but it's definitely worth dropping a nuke during that event. 
---
Good to know of this is true I want to throw a party this weekend at my hotel I'm building
---
Hotfix doesn't imply it's a live update.
---
Touchy subject.
---
The last straw ppl cling to is if you build your character around pvp and farm a full set of armor, both of which are bug investments, then yuh can counter a single drop.
---
Rediculous logic overall but ppl cling to it.
---
The effort needed is night and day to be op and to counter op.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the confirmations.
---
Sacrifices to the almighty atom must be made! Lol. 
---
Those are plans to mod equipment. If you don't have the BOS underarmor or Marine wetsuit, the plans are useless.
---
The thing is you need the actual plan for the underarmor first, shielded is an add on. For example, you still need the “marine wetsuit” plan in order to craft shielded marine underarmor
---
&gt; I get 3 caps off a super mutant which is worth more that what you get from a SB
---
Have you eaten a cooked scorchbeast brain? It restores so much hunger.
---
"I paid 1/6 the price and have only a few hours on this game. Why all the hate"
---
Do you mean the excavator PA?
---
Wait, what???? You can open that door???????? I was so sure it was something for future dlc!!! Man, I feel so embarrassed! hahaha Gonna check it out, thank you!!! =\]\]
---
That is amazing! You guys are amazing that is funny. I believe my wife showed me no mercy when i became wanted, team or not. Gotta love our SOs
---
Exploits aside ... fair point.  But still.  It should have sat in BETA for a bit longer and released with a way bigger day 1 patch.  It should not have gone gold.  
---
It may be unkind to say it, but...yes, I think they should have understood better what they were buying merely by looking at the company's other items, and researching the sources of their spirits. 
---
Is it just or is alot of these types of posts popping up recently. Just a bit suspicious. However the fact you got it now makes it so you dont understand how bad it was at release. Between the bugs that would break the game, broken quests, missing features, and constant disconnects the start of this game was rough. Now Bethesda has fix the more prominent bugs and broken quests. They have also added in some missing features. The disconnects though that they cant seem to fix. 
---
Damn, that’s lame. I wish there was some consistency to all of this.
---
I keep getting little kids begging for screws or something. 
---
I like them. They tag melee enemies for me and they 1 shot the annoying radroaches in bunkers.
---
They are supposed to be ultra rare. The person you bought one from was a cheater, most likely, otherwise they wouldn't have had an extra one to sell.
---
It’s quite selfish and I will not be used in that manner. Unless of course you want to toss me a stimpak or something for making it happen. 
---
I didn’t even know behemoths were in this game. Until last night when I was looking for a new place to build my camp. Stumbled upon a beautiful pond, thinking that it was the perfect place.. then slowly a behemoth rose out of the water..
---
Just a bit northwest of the vault, there’s a farm. That is the house :) 
---
Irony only Alanis Morissette could appreciate 
---
Lolololololol ok bud
---
Oh my yes. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when they decided that the endgame would be farming generic enemies in a mid level zone. I honestly don't think it was a conscious decision and that it just kinda happened via negligence. 
---
Playing with friends should always be an exception. 
---
Yeah man I am aware of a big patch that dropped literally the day before I bought it! 
---
But it’s my understanding it was bug fixes.  Not new features. 
---
The game is the same, just runs smoother. Which is great for us newbies. 
---
But content wise, it’s the same game you’ve had since release pretty much. Give or take a few features, like push to talk. Right? 
---
Not sure if I’m right on this one, feel free to correct me. 
---
I though that was the first one, you would just unequip and reequip armor with the pocketed mod on it really quick and it would increase your carry weight. 
---
&gt;i'm a teacher
---
well today you are a learner because i am going to teach you about this neat little feature called "edit"
---
I assume there will be seasonal events, maybe a repopulation with human npcs... here's hoping! =\]\]
---
Ok, you just order the highlights of my FO76 builds package lol.  Back soon.
---
T-51 looks nicer.
---
I feel you, man. I only recently read about where to get the BOS PA. I too had to realize I must have thrown away "just another power chassis".
---
Have you heard about the settlements up north? ;)
---
First 2 were last night at Whitesprings, luckily I had the security helping me.
---
I'm level 35, but still didn't see much damage given, and my rewards were pitiful.
---
When I first started, me and a friend came across one near a mine, he was doing a quest and was attacked by one, now, this was early game where we were about level 10-15, I hid in a building and that stupid acid breath took me out quickly, I wasn't even fighting it.
---
I was at the disposal sight south east of R&amp;G station yesterday and it spawned a mob of Behemoths. Had to kill 7 of them including a legendary. I have never seen more than 1 at a time anywhere. Don’t know if it was a glitch or what, but it was scary as hell. 
---
Anchor Farm, NW of Vault 76
---
You're awesome, thanks!
---
I do a sell run each night. It's been my experience that the caps reset after 20 hours. It's been pretty consistent for me.
---
Gotcha, my bad!
---
It will still be full of ghouls but not as strong. Levels range from 9-64 I believe. It's dependant on your level or the level of whoever loaded the zone to cause them to spawn.
---
You are concern trolling.  Dupers and cheaters always do that. 
---
lmao dupers not wanting to give up their duplication method actually makes complete sense
---
Yeah, I updated the post. I have the BoS item to mod, but the shielded mod doesn't appear in my list of known mods. I have the others.
---
Np. My psn is Ysobutthurt btw. 👍🏻
---
Anchor Farms! :) 
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/File:Anchor_Farm_map.png
---
Until dupers and their buyers get banned/lose every item this is going to continue. 
---
Yep. We used to pass the controller now we can play together.
---
&gt; goofy flags or stripes or whatever
---
Bethesda's version is also black, with more PotUS-themed livery rather than Enclave. It's somewhat close to the BoS paints in overall  fit and feel, rather than the fairly gaudy Patriot paint.
---
Sugar Grove is good, lots of telephones. In fact pretty much any office is going to net you some copper. 
---
You kill the wendigo while wearing the clown suit. It’s a common misunderstanding with the wording 
---
I'm also disappointed that the fantasy fusion cells do not specifically say if they're Duracell or Energizer and the Gauss 2mm cartridges don't actually list any power source. Don't even get me started on Supersledge fuel.
---
So, did you know that Brawndo has electrolytes? 
---
It’s what plants crave. Lmao. 
---
Happy cake day!! ^.^
---
It goes both ways.  Downvoting for genuine critique.  Downvoting for trying to ask a simple question like op's.
---
Comes with a game that is severely divided over issues that come with a game unfinished. 
---
I think that you just need the underarmor item, not the plan, in order to craft the mod. Either way, I have the BoS underarmor plans. I cannot craft the shielded mod.
---
Nope one thing that was missing for some really dumb reason was legendary hunting rifles. This shouldn't of been missing and was added in with the patch. There were other things like push to talk and the fov. Generally though the hate isnt for the bugs but for the extremely shady way they handled customer service and their items both in the atom shop and the duffle kerfuffle/Nuka dark
---
If history has shown us anything it is that humans are stupid. Good luck holding that ocean back with a broom.
---
Wife, teenager, toddler, dog, cat, house that seems to need fixing every day and a job. My wife works ever other weekend so that's nice but otherwise i try to sneak in an hour here and there when she goes to bed. hard going, though. 
---
Lol y'all really think they're gonna fix this shit? 
---
Yea, but those pages are just randomly updated. So u less you check it every day for changes it doesn't exactly help
---
&gt; We’ve been receiving great feedback from our PC players on the latest #Fallout76 patch.
---
Yet again -- thanks for all the beta testing you PC master race heroes!
---
Yeah, it's become obvious this is bait at this point.
---
Same here, tons of really fun holotapes just documenting the dire situation that the survivors were in. There’s a lot of atmosphere in this game too that I hadn’t experienced in f4
---
I bought a cheap motorized TV lift on eBay and bolted it to the wall behind the TV cabinet in my front room.  Now when I get home I can lift the second TV up and play fallout with the wife on the sofa 
---
To greedy man
---
I met a couple who had a store they were running together. He ran the chems and ammo desk, she had a second line for weapons.
---
How many do you want
---
I don't have the marine one, so I am unsure if that one has the same bug. I do have the BoS underarmor, the shielded mod was not on my list of mods.
---
&gt;need
---
Nope. It'd be real nice.
---
Anchor Farm in the Forest. 
---
Ha! 
---
Jerk. 
---
Lol. 
---
It's a joke, ofcourse there aren't any canvas bags if you order nylon bags.
---
The joke is that they never ordered canvas in the first place
---
Not always.  Many collector's edition goes for higher price.  The only reason this is lower now is the bad publicity Bethesda got from their 'flawed' deployment of the game and some of their poor PR decisions.  
---

Your feelings are kind of severe and misplaced, friend.

Can't help you out personally but you could also try posting to /r/fo76filthycasuals They have a discord too I think.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense sometimes I tend to lump the savage divide and the mire together 
---
This whole post is just bait for a flamewar, based on OP'z extremely hostile responses to disagreement, including relatively reasonable ones.
---
"Unfinished!? I bet you are a duper."
---
You should get a lvl3 White Knight just for the repair cost reductions. Switch em out just before repairing. Pair it with Fix It Good for 200% armor.
---
Honestly I hate getting random invites, especially if I am in the middle of something, first thing that comes to my mind is "oh FGS leave me alone"
---
I prefer to help people via reddit, or people that i chose to help in game rather then having it shoved on me.
---
I swear I have found the atom shop house too or something very similar
---
Level up
---
I'd have looked into the company - honestly most of it seems to be a novelty item people were unhappy with because they thought it was glass and they thought it would be good rum but in the end it really had nothing to do with fallout 76 the game 
---
same with the canvas bag nothing to do with in game mechanics - honestly if I was a company I'd stop doing cheesy ultimate packs with limited edition items they never are good items they always cause annoyance just put the game in a vault tech lunch box and move on instead of doing these stupid novelty items OR maybe sell them separately as merchandise 
---
I've been putting them in the bag outside the door at the whitesprings rail station vendor since there isn't anything near him at the bar
---
Thats too damn cute. 
---
I bought a pip boy skip, if I’m going to be looking at it often I want it to be pretty! And the peace sign pose because I’m trying to get into taking lots of pictures of my adventure.
---
They tend to spawn around the tree house in the swamp area. 
---
I would just assume a Nerf is coming. They only have two options. To Nerf the current op builds or to introduce new possible legendary mods and perks that will offer other options for equivalent damage. 
---
Since the dmg numbers now are absurd and people are legit doing around 15x a players Max hp, I would expect the former.
---
Nah I returned it because it was bad 
---

I do my priorities first but if it's still there when I get a free chance, I'll accept the invite to see.

Nice work!  I ditched my Enclave uniform in disgust after watching the video that goes through the various Enclavce recordings in chronological order. But I still wear the X01 armor sometimes and check with the vendors there (oh the shame).  I would like to see something like what you did in game at some point.
---

---
Same, there are some issues but for the most part people that actually play it, and gave it an honest chance, have enjoyed it/had fun with it.  Alot of the complaints I see are:
---
No NPC; which is wrong, there are no HUMAN npc, and that's entirely explained in the main story and was likely done at start so that as the 'overarching' story of Apalachia goes on, and vaults open, people start moving around the country again I'm willing to be that there will be people npc that will start showing up. (And yes, I can name a number of these, like Sherrif in Watoga, Mayor-Bot of Grafton, Rose, Prize Bot, Mr.Messenger, mufuggin Grahm the Super Mutant, list goes on and that's off the top of my head)
---
'No story'; there's a ton of story, it's just not spoon fed to you, you have to figure shit out, much like in most MMO, they can't have you changing the entire world forever on a server as that'd impact all other players
---
'It's a glitchy mess'; not nearly as bad as people claim, sure I see the ocasional t-pose enemy (it's hillarious with roaches) and even some texture glitches, and 'stretchy neck' bugs, but usually they make me chuckle more than anything,  Hell, I've head shot a scorch so hard that it's head fell off, without falling off the model, and the one still on the model stretchy necked and it made me have to stop for a minute cause of how hard I was laughing.  The only 'game breaking' glitch I've really encountered in almost 200hrs of play time was the damage bug that they've fixed.
---
I always check it to see what things they're selling that were once completely and totally free in FO4.  
---
Coming up next week... 500 atoms for dirty tribly hat
---
When my friends and I nuked Morgantown there were indeed ghouls. Not as many as Whitesprings, but enough to be interesting and it was fun to do something different.
---
What console do play on. I got a very good lvl 30 smg I think that happy to donate to you
---
Happened to me too friend.
---
It sucks, my suggestion is to avoid peak times in the US, or join people in the silo once they've started it.
---
Those are the only two ways I've been able to launch, otherwise it's a guaranteed dc.
---
You'll need a lot of stimpacks and a lot of Rad away. At your level it would be good to team up with a higher level who has rad reducing perks.
---
Some of us don’t have our lives to throw into this game.  Some of us play when we have a few hours to spare, and have scraped along since Beta to hit level 50.  Nuking my inventory would 100% make me quit the game for good.  
---
Has nothing to do with greed.  It has to do with me not having any desire to lose all the progress I’ve made in my scant spare time since November.  Maybe you don’t mind plugging away for another month or two, but a hell of a lot of us do.
---
I bought the American flag, and some posters
---
Ok but it's widespread known enough to of spread like wildfire but not have a shred of proof in existence. Yeah that makes total sense
---
Naw. Im looking for that Nº1 scenic spot dawg.
---
I bought pup boy skin the possum malt liquor sign glowing map n I’m saving up for armor paints 
---
Give it time
---
The excavator power armor works well for the nuke zones. I cannot speak for how well the T45 does.  Make sure you take multiple weapons with you and plenty of meds. 
---
Nice. Maybe your just PRE railroad? They had to start somewhere. 
---
I would guess that's how the duping works as well. Pass items from Player A to Player B, let Player B save by logging out, then Player A does whatever to trigger a rollback on the server, which restores his items. Now Player B can log back in and they can consolidate and do it again.
---
Yea the Enclave is definitely a messed up faction throughout the lore of Fallout, but they have some of the nicest things :/
---
I dont think it will have the enclave logo. The US flag with stars in a circle is more likely since the president is suppose to represent the whole nation and the enclave is supposed to be a hidden society. So it's more likely that what's shown on the PA is this  https://reho.st/self/5e8caf525a3d9cc4f086f3d7b6b5f98c05a479f6.jpg  But nice work!
---
It's luck. You have started playing after the first patch that brought the game to a functional level for most players. Before this, there were major issues, including lots of bugs that ruined entire (sometimes 50+ hour playtime) characters which Bethesda does not have the tools to fix. Lots of people who experienced these actual game breaking bugs are still quite bitter, and very fairly so.
---
Found one of these at level SEVEN, yes, level seven.
---
Tried my hardest to kill it but only got it to around 4/5ths hp and gave up lmao
---
I'm well aware of what doesn't work in the game.  I've seen most if the bugs and disconnects etc.  Ive played 100s of hours. But I still love it.  It's a new, beautiful Fallout world!  I cant help but love that.  I'll love it even more when they fix it
---
I noticed the condition, as well. I believe the CND is based on your intellect level minus one. I had a few that were at 111%, but this morning, I used some buffs to up my Int and sure enough, it was 118% and my Int was at 19. I don't see a relevance to this, as it has not effect on how many rounds you can fire (maxed at 500), but I do theorize that that crafting normal fusion cores (at the Chemist workbench) will also beneifit from Int and that is why the UFC gets it as well. Using the Power User perk card will increase your rounds, based on rank (max 600/800/1000), so if you're worried about ammo, I'd suggest using this. 
---
I got the Weapons workbench.. Now waiting for the armor bench. It has been data-mined, but yet to be seen in the Shop.
---
maybe they are just trying to draw people into PVP...
---
From what I understand (keep in mind I don't have the link) it's going to be full size dlcs
---
Depends on gear &amp; build obviously. Fresh LVL 51 with probably whatever 1* legendary they picked up along the way it's probably very resource intensive.
---
There is a behemoth at twin lakes. If you just really want to fight one. He seems to always be there, in the lake like Swan. 
---
That's what people here like to believe. I think it's more likely due to poor coding and not having the right infrastructure for the demand. Before this everyone was blaming the carry weight glitch. It's convenient for Bethesda that we're blaming each other for all these problems.
---
Don't grow up too fast kid... adulting is work =P
---
This might sound like someone asking if your computer is plugged in, but do you have the armor perk card equipped the the required perk level? (have not come close to getting the item you are working on so i dont know if it even needs the card)
---
Have you gotten stable flux yet?
---
I can't make ultracite ammo yet because i haven't made the stable flux yet.
---
The other day I spawned into the clubhouse and it was filled with those Chinese bots instead of ghouls. Everyone of them gave a low level legendary item, level 1-15 1 star. I just took it all to Flatwoods and gave it away. Ps4 btw.
---
Some people/care kit for others, so I hope it gets patched and ruins their day, more stability is what we need not less.
---
70
---
There's nothing in Bethesda's behavior history that indicates they give a crap about balance though.
---
Energy bagels.
---
I like it.
---
What is this topic?  "Why should I play the game if other people already played the game?"
---
Lol my husband did the same thing last weekend
---
Good... Maybe I will stop killing myself then!
---
I've played some with my wife. Mostly when it's the two of us we love doing stuff in photomode together. I should probably make a second character to play through with her so we can play quests together and stuff.
---
Same here. More people just run from me than actually notice the paper bag I’m tea-bagging in hopes that they’ll notice the damn thing. 
---
WHY U NO AMMO ?!?!
---
That's due to the dupers/exploiters, as most of the dupes require them to cause server lag/instability so that they can drop something, forcibly d/c themselves before it fully registers that the item(s) in question are no longer in their inventory and rejoin to pick it up, or get it from a budy that was there to pick up the dropped items.
---
This post is what gets this subreddit hate.
---
Thank you for your brand new and and previously unsaid perspective.  I hadn't thought of it that way and I certainly haven't read, basically, the exact same tirade on this subreddit at least fifteen times a day for the last two months straight.  
---
Bless you, sir.  You're doing God's work.
---
Your answer, not fast, sauce is my build.
---
Could be, for sure. I don't really wanna play against 4 or 5 people all with TSEs though...
---
I'm in the one from this Reddit and it always seems dead. Maybe I'm just playing at shit hours. 
---
I buy a crap ton of camp items 
---
The game has always ran pretty poorly on my powerful rig, the server stability has definitely been impacted by the duping though.
---
You should do these tests against another player with known armor stats while you guys are engaged in pvp. Then you could know exactly how much damage each one does. I would be willing to help you with this if you are on PC.
---
I've also noticed it happens if you take damage after getting downed. So for instance if a SB blasts u with 3 blasts if the first one downs you the second is already on the way and will almost certainly kill kill you
---
True but not sure anyone would take the time to duped lvl 35s
---
Probably why I’m so low level. I work 6 days a week
---
That's a hard one to say they knew or didn't know. You put a spot like that in the game and players are going to figure it out quickly. 
---
Vendors dont stock legendary equipment , your seeing stuff sold by players to the vendors. 
---
😉
---
there's a pond in the Savage Divide, near twin lakes (south, maybe?), that spawns a lvl 50 behemoth. I'll double check this when I get home, but I think, if you fast travel to Twins Lakes, then follow the water downhill, you'll come upon a large pond with a blue water machine on the far shore. In the middle of the pond, there's a rock with a shopping cart. That's no rock.
---
It's also worth noting that there are multiple workbenches near Pleasant Valley Ski Resort for scrapping.  South of the resort is the Pleasant Valley Station for unloading junk to your Stash Box.
---
I have, I've made the shielded Vault Suit lining before, was making the Brotherhood of Steel one for a friend specializing in unarmed attacks
---
Move your camp to a copper node.
---
Those chinese vases give 2 copper. Maybe try farming the palace? (I can't check now, but I remember seeing a lot of them.)
---
2 things, bethesda Austin isn't the same team as previous fallout games.
---
And fo76 is multiplayer. I wouldn't bank on balance methods in singleplayer games by different dev teams to apply here
---
I've seen the eyebots a handful of times, I'm assuming a low level player wandered over there. 
---
will hit you up tonight when I get on...  I have a few 1\*'s that I hate to just sell to a vendor.
---
&gt;lovely people on PC
---
heh good one
---
And when you DC from private servers? You'll realize the root cause
---
Ok that’s what I’ll do, I just didn’t know if I should be going for good weapons because so far I’ve just been playing it like a normal fallout 
---
For me the servers have been bugging since the PC update. Console players are trying to dupe as much as possible before the patch, so it's causing servers to crash more often. (My guess anyway)... 
---
Thanks everyone. For some reason never found it lol
---
Watoga Train Station, shares with Graham only.
---
Well, if it is that little work, why hasn't Bethesda done it?
---
I’m on Xbox 
---
you want gun or plan?
---
*claps in the distance*
---
Same here!  Power Armor paints seem to be the best value imo.  Get paints for all sets, instead of just one set of regular armor that you'll never wear a matching suit of anyway... or cover it up with cosmetics.
---
One thing that's not obvious with some of these side quests when we find bodies that are relatively fresh...how recently are a lot of the quest lines being told? I get why they wanted to make a zero-NPC game - but it's unrealistic to believe that literally everyone who isn't scorched or a vault dweller in west virginia died *just* before we got out?  Especially when the scorched plague doesn't exist anywhere else in the universe and not every ghoul is feral.
---
If you don't know how to do it, you would not be able to test it.
---
You can change your spawn location by moving your CAMP object around your camp. It keeps the camp's borders the same but loves the physical object (so you can put it inside your house) and, while you don't spawn on the same spot as the CAMP object, your spawn/fast travel landing spot will change when you move it; at least it always does for me. 
---
Plans
---
Eh, arguable, ive read plenty of terminals while under attack. It wasnt immersive when i could stop time to read a terminal. It is now that i have to clear the area before i do
---
And make Todd the God angry? I don’t think so.
---
I don't think I've tried with the perk plugged in, but usually the mod would show up and just not be craft-able without the card.
---
It's a good thought, though, I'll try the card tonight and see if it causes the mod to appear on my list.
---
It probably should and this alone would make it arguably the best helmet mod.
---
That said, maybe it does. The last time I installed a targeting HUD it actually didn't do anything except randomly aggro neutral NPCs.
---
I had this idea last week, and totally agree. You get a plan for Classic Photo Frame. And when you craft one, it then lets you pick which photo you want in it. Then you get to hang it in your place. 
---
There could be several different size options. So you can make some fun collection in your camp. 
---
I'm curious if it's possible to nuke somewhere like Flatwoods?  (probably a waste and all).  I remember when I first started playing I was in a Flatwoods trailer at level 3 or so.  I heard the nuke warning (didn't know much about it at the time) and thought "where the hell am I supposed to take shelter?  This bathroom here?"
---
Later I learned the warning is map wide, even though the nuke is confined to an area.
---
There's a behemoth that usually spawns near the monorail pylon marker in the big. Also a mega sloth at the tree house in the bog.
---
Was this on pc post-patch? Because I looted someone else's container last night (picked the lock and all) and never became wanted.
---
I buy clothing.
---
Ah jeez sorry. Fallout universe didnt get a chance to go through the civil rights era, cause bombs. 
---
Unless it happened in the vault. But we are in west virginia... So....
---
Lore friendly marriage would be a marvelous scandal. Todd hates gays! No gay marriage in fo76?!?! 
---
Lol. This game needs another bad press scandal anyway. Its been like 2 weeks since the last one.
---
Harpers ferry is where i got mine. 
---
You might be too high level now though. I think it's 15-25 but I'm not certain
---
I work too much myself.  I'm just saying take time and enjoy the leveling process.  It's much more fun than grinding nuke zones for xp/loot.  There's plenty of time for that once you get past 50 imo.
---
Got em
---
Ok, I won’t worry about it to much then. Is 50 as high a level as weapons go or do they go as high as your rank?
---
Absolutely, and we won't ever know for sure. However, I think the whole "oops these ghouls are giving boss level exp, lets wait two months to fix it" things lends a little bit to my theory.
---
Harpers ferry is where i find them at. 
---
I try and always leave my leftover plans, ammo, and food items in a container right next to vendors. It's been helpful in my experience on occasion and I like the pay it forward. 
---
Yep, I am having that same problem, it's really annoying to turn to go through a door then end up walking into a wall because of whatever it is...
---
I'm just sad that duping is still a thing... And worse then before....
---
I was in a nuke zone in Morgantown. Plenty of Bloated Glowing Ones, but didn't find any legendaries at all after ~2 dozen ghouls or so. Feed the People event only turned up like 3 robots and one ghoul total.
---
Deal of the day boys, get em while they last. 
---
TBH im level 201 and nukes are getting boring i hope they release something for the endgame soon, btw try to powerlevel if you want ive done that rushing through the main questline and doing all the sidequests and i ended up being lvl 46 or so then i farmed some events till level 50, crafted my xo1 pa and farmed nuke sites... And here i am 200+ h without anything to do... 
---
We did the palace yesterday and it was terrible. The only thing that made it slightly worthwhile was the are you head back meditation event was able to be activated during it. We got to three star legendaries and after the event was over no other enemies spawned. Two glowing deathclaws showed up at the battlefield graveyard and that's it. How do I have
---
Anchor Farm location shown here:
---
https://youtu.be/PeDCtItVlYM
---
Third time I try to do the event and an unscheduled maintenance comes up. I guess it's better than a random disconnect, they better fix the issue they were having.
---
This is how it is with me and claiming workshops
---
I was worried about that.
---
I had a scorched melee attack me with a one-handed minigun.
---
You sure about that?  I watched a couple of videos that nuked it... wasn't a 3 star, just a level 95 behemoth.
---
least rewarding part of the game. Continuing the trend of pointless pseudo endgame
---
You should *really* drink a Nuka Grape, boy
---
For the record, I'm not saying "what's the big deal." I'm saying it happened and all we can do now is try to enjoy the game in our own way and hope Bethesda can salvage. I'm saying to accept your reality and make the best of it. You know, kind of how adults do when they grow up.
---
I got lucky at Quarry X3 when she opened the door! and got stuck in the workshop building. I could take my time and shoot/scoot from a distance. I was in the mid-20s at the time so I would have had little to no chance without it.
---
 They need to uncap the handmade at lever action plans, that is just dumb.
---
Ironically, my "trader" alt works for Vault-Tec, uses the Vault-Tec uniform from VTU, uses the VT logo on his camp, VT color scheme.... 
---
and is totally not under orders by Vault Tec to perform any type of experiments...  \*wink\* \*wink\*
---
They could  make private servers essentially be like offline, but it requires internet connection to stay connected like For Honor does it. That way we get the benefits of offline and they don't get their game pirated.
---
But what if I l like getting Rad Worms?  
---
Don't, the game stops being fun after 5 minutes. I bought one, killed a few scorchbeasts, then sold it for a chameleon recipe
---
That is largely irrelevant to the end users, Bethesda gave it their stamp to sell - they are absolutely culpable in that. 
---
The drops are somewhat scaled to your level and the "area level" where the relay is located. If you use the relay tower in Watoga you'll get better stuff.  Still nothing amazing, but better than a level 5 fire axe and some throwing knives.
---
Im only looking fot the one. But i do have a buddy looking for one as well
---
twitter 
---
I've had this but with dupers grab there junk left and got messages saying reported 2 weeks later they messaged saying there com bans were over for false accusation 
---
Yup, but every one blames Bethesda for it, not the company that actually made the product.
---
Hmm... my dupedar is beeping quite loudly.
---
I got interrupted by the server coming down and a defense mission. But my stopwatch said 5:50 when 5 more water popped up.
---
Single servers will do that.
---
PC just went down for maintenance again 
---
I'm waiting to buy something I actually like. It's all a matter of preference really since it is all cosmetic. I want a badass PA or regular armor skin. What I REALLY want is for them to start adding weapon skins (no that stupid chrome minigun doesnt count)
---
Some of the schematics appear to be locked behind a 20-24 hour spawn cycle.  So if you grab the first schematic that pops and it's not what you are looking for, then you might not see another one for a while... that being said other people can still trigger respawns in areas too but you might hop 20+ servers before you find that one server where someone else spawned one and didn't take it.  It's weird, but when someone shared this information (shout out to u/confusedswitch and his thread here [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae920w/plan\_farming\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae920w/plan_farming_guide/) ) I started leaving behind the ones that I didn't need and was able to consistently hop to find what I want in MUCH less time and load screens.  Don't take me at face value though, try it out yourself and see :-)  Hope that makes sense and helps!  Good luck in your farming!
---
"I just bought this brand new AAA car, I love driving it!! Sometimes it pulls over on it's own and kicks me out of the seat, but I totally don't get why people dislike that - I just simply back into the seat and start the engine again"
---
It will be quire the opposite- first new content gon' get a lot of traffic. 
---
Where did you hear about this hotfix?
---
I'll take it!! I'm on ps4 but unfortunately I won't be home till 330-4 
---
I never heard anyone not wanting to wear PA. What is the benefit you get from not? Is it just the look? I would think the benefits of the PA would outweigh the look.
---
On console, but it was pushed to Tuesday and I'm on pc.
---
I like yours better.
---
Yeppers... I think it's extremely idiotic, given that the game literally says (SPOILER)  &gt;!!Here, have a full set of X-01 Power Armour plans on us!&lt; once you get jiggy with the enclave.
---
Hotfix on PC today
---
On the bright side my girl got tired of hearing post apocalyptic battles in our tiny apartment so she got me some turtle beach headphones. 
---
Because a lot of players are paranoid of each other
---
It's not.  The Forest (except a few bits in the far north) is disallowed on the map where you select a target.  You can get as close as Charleston or Whitespring, that's it.
---
No kill like overkill. 
---
It definitely didn't deserve the bad review scores it got, playing close to 100 hrs I had things to do all the time and just now am running out of stuff as it's more event quests left. I think they took a risk to build on the game in time instead of releasing it in perfect shape, but they also put a lot if work in what was released. My biggest issue is no npc's still, but they did a great job making the game as it is and I think reviewers affect each other, if they still played it now and reviewed again I think they would give a very different verdict.
---
Or play the Division with all their hateful cheaters using Chronus Max 
---
That’s the annoying thing about it, if it wasn’t for the bugs and disconnects it would be a very good game. That would only need a few improvements to aspects like the CAMP and additions like dlc’s but with the bugs etc it makes it not fun and makes me not want to play as much as I have been 
---
lol also don't forget that last weeks podcast will be mentioned in the podcast from 3 days ago and also the one after the next big bang!
---
The game crash more often for me when im building stuff in my workshop.
---
Seen that a lot. My build is for the explosive shotgun though so i do run around with a quad cap combat shotgun as well
---
Ps4
---
everything caps at 50, including weapons, armor, your effective level, etc, except enemy level.
---
If this was on PC I might have been part of that! :) I was going to post this at some point, I’ll edit later with pics of the 500 POUNDS of extra legendaries people got to pick over!!
---
Make a few more and send em in.
---
Do a Mr. Fuzzy PA.
---
I have a tse shotgun i bought of the bazaar,  the spread sucks.  My favorite is my anti armor vamprice explosive shotgun. The damage difference is noticeable but it's nice not shooting the broad side of a barn. 
---
didn't run far eh?
---
For me, it's just a lot of little things that really make it worse for me, I'm mostly fine with the general concept.
---
Mods fixed the 3 biggest problems though, per usual
---
Sorry, I was tired and forgot the grab the link here you go mate.  [https://anchor.fm/survivevault76/episodes/Jan-13th-2019-Episode-1-Welcome-to-SAAC-Radio-e2ujd1](https://anchor.fm/survivevault76/episodes/Jan-13th-2019-Episode-1-Welcome-to-SAAC-Radio-e2ujd1)
---
Flatwoods is in the nuke free zone around Vault 76, so we can't nuke there unfortunately.
---
Ah, just ignore them. They get their jollies going around bashing on 76. Yeah, the game isn't perfect, but they're pretty dedicated to the hate train. If you don't believe me, just check out their posting history. You have to go back 10 months to see a post from them that's *not* about the hate train.
---
&gt; ~~Me and my wife play together~~

My wife and I play together
---
Server rollbacks and disconnects aren't two different things. A "rollback" is just what happens when you disconnect and load into your last save. If your last save was five minutes ago, then you've "rolledback" to that point.
---
Death seems to fix it, at least temporarily.
---
It was not at a Samsung booth but at one that had other branded items.
---
So unban the duppers and exploiters, to show a bit of contrition.
---
But screw over all the honest players who would lose everything by your stupid ideas?
---
You are literally asking Bethesda to say a big FUCK YOU to all the players that earned everything honestly, and by playing the game as it's meant to be played.  
---
You didn't once consider that, in your self righteous quest.  
---
Answer that. How come it's ok to ask Bethesda to screw over all these honest players? Why should that happen? More so to let banned players back in? So the guy that got banned for his homophobia should be let back in? How is it Bethesda's fault he did all that?   
---
Why should honest players lose everything because you think you're so much smarter than everyone else??
---
i think he was being sarcastic
---
Im pretty sure the whole buying legendary weapons off vendors is gonna go away sooner or later. 
---
I went into my first nuke zone around level 42 with the Excavator armor - That plus Rad-X, and you can survive, but be sure to bring plenty of Radaway and stimpacks. He might have some trouble trying to bring down the ferals, but even one or two of them would mean around 600 to 1000 EXP for him, which is worth the risk if you plan properly. 
---
I play on PC and my Fiance plays on Xbox. We are in the same room so that is fun, but I have been trying to talk her into joining the pcmasterrace so we can play together. I just don't really want to buy another Xbox. 
---
$5? No way. It'll be $15
---
Bethesda Support tweet 15 mins before I posted the question. https://twitter.com/bethesdasupport/status/1084842536743698434
---
If you’d like an honest discussion on this, you’re free to reply to my earlier comment - ya know where I addressed this directly? And you didn’t have a proper retort other than to throw insults?
---
How can this bee done? "Joining" on the PS4 puts you in a server instead.
---
This is on PS4.
---
Thats what i plan on doing as soon as i find someone new. Even modded some of the items for fun.
---
Yeah for consoles which been pushed for tommorrow. I assume due to new patches that will come now for PC
---
Yeah, I took off the number of hours...that really does push it over the top. I just think it would be cool to somewhat progress together. 
---
They always have a few rounds left for me.  Sometimes more than it took to kill them!
---
Same.  The ONLY time I've ever seen him.
---
Right.... Go take a long look at my posts and comments and then look at your own and tell me who is out here trolling. 👍🏼
---
How long will the servers be down?
---
Well here's the thing...
---
I pre ordered to play the Beta. I actually kinda liked the beta, had a fun time just exploring, despite the glitches and bad AI. I had 1 instance of crashing through the multiple beta sessions. 
---
So I thought "hey, the full game is likely to have some of the creases smoothed out! This isn't too bad!"
---
Then launch day came. I played for 3 hours or so, continuing from my beta progress. The game completely crashed *multiple* times, the AI was virtually non-existent, bad textures, server issues and so on. This was not the beta, there was ***zero*** excuse to have a game launched in that state. It was a technical disaster and a failure. For me, it was literally unplayable, I could not go into areas with lots of players or with lots of buildings or enemies without the game crashing.
---
That was launch day. I played for 3 hours. And because I had similar issues with FO4 I knew this wasn't going to get any better, possibly ever. 
---
I submitted my ticket for a refund 3 hours after launch. The game had tons of issues then, I dare say I wasn't the only one asking for a refund as well.
---
If you have had the game for anything longer than a few hours and downloaded it, I think you are going to have a really hard time getting a refund. Especially if they've had time to supposedly repair a few of their hundreds of bugs, glitches and optimisation issues. I think Xbox might have a policy where you can refund a game a short time after downloading it though, but I can't confirm that.
---
My advice: 
---
Try it. Ask for a refund. But I was very specific about the issues I was having. I was able to say exactly why I found the game broken. Maybe that's what made xbox refund me. Because I wasn't just saying "game crashes and the graphics are bad", I was saying "Game crashes when near too many NPC's and static objects, the textures are frequently not rendering into the game properly as well as things not rendering at all. The AI is often completely frozen and won't move. The C.A.M.P. system doesn't work properly as I have lost large amounts of junk moving the camp from one place to another, which has ruined hours of collecting. Hit detection doesn't work, which makes the gun play frustrating and unfair. In some cases I have been killed by an invisible enemy that I cannot shoot or see, which led to me losing more junk that I had spent time looking for."
---
As you can see by the description, it makes a difference when you can say why the game is shit. They can't argue with that, by the description above, the game is not fit for purpose or sale.
---
So to conclude, if you can make a case that the game is still broken and it hasn't been long since you downloaded it you shouldn't have any problems.
---
This is still bugged. I am having the same issue. Collected the other blood samples but no option to collect wolf blood and have tried in several locations.
---
Good to know that they are ironing stuff out now but console is gonna be aids cause dupers are gonna go rampant again 
---
And yet the majority of nukes drop in low level zones
---
Sounds like the government trying to take out all torrent sites.  Good luck..
---
They could fix the problem at the source though.  That's probably where they're focusing their efforts.
---
Partner and I play together. It's the most fun I've had in a game in quite some time.
---
How should I know ?
---
I see where you're coming from, but since the President is in the Enclave bunker and they already have Enclave branding on uniforms and Items within the bunker who is to say that they wouldn't have altered the original symbol on the presidents armor as well? My thinking was this was the Enclaves power armor for the President, not the original power armor the president has had post war. Thanks!
---
Seriously, do you have any toys left to throw out after all your tantrums?  
---
I have played FO76 most days since launch and continue to play.  
---
I like FO76, a lot, it's certainly grown on me the more I play.  
---
I understand some have issues with it, but I'm not a dev, so I know I can't fix the game, best thing I can do is just play the game, and do my best to ignore the whining snowflakes failing to support this title.  
---
You find a problem, report it, carry on playing, whining for the sake of it or a reaction on social media is pathetic.
---
I’d be willing. I’ve spent enough time alone in the ‘wastes. 
---
That looks freaking awesome
---
I will agree with you on the gutsy's. I don't worry much about my health normally, but a group of those will just chew right through my power armor. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't take 2-3 times more hits to kill than a deathclaw, haha.
---
On topic of the lumber yard in the top left being nuked, only seen it once and went there, barely any enemies and didn't really respawn any for quite some time and we all left. I have been trying to some other areas, morgantown wasn't too terrible, had quite a few glowing enemies, but didn't see one legendary when I did it. We do just need some other special enemies in different areas. Only thing I hate about nuking random areas is that I would hate to destroy someones camp since they think only whitesprings and prime are the only areas to worry about.
---
The Mire is a big result from vault 94's opening, exposing the spores.
---
Tbf they only drop nukes at whitesprings
---
Twitter
---
No.  Most of your points punish the people who played honestly and lets the cheaters and exploiters off the hook.  People who cheat once will most likely do it again especially if they are "unpunished".  "They let me off last time so I'll just do it again."  We don't need players like that.  If they want to play honestly they can buy another copy.  
---
Well that explains why my camp was so popular when I had it on that cliff
---
 didn't you hear?  Accusing everything that exists as a duper/ cheater is so in right now.  Accuse everything for that sweet bandwagon karma.
---
Cool, I just must have really shitty luck at rng.
---
Convenient.  I post to ask how to report a cheater, without mentioning anyone by name, and this upsets you that a person linked me to the location?  
---
It’s pretty obvious what is really upsetting you and people like you.  
---
Jeebus.  You could buy an x-01 fully modded with jetpack for that...
---
[Pure speculation] Odds are it has to with the server issues people have reported since the last patch. 
---
There's a floating polygon of water near the big Monorail elevator.
---
Ok that nice to know eventually I’ll be able to find weapons and amour that I like and not have to keep trading them out
---
They are, however, very concerned about slowing down player progress. Nerfing weapon damage might fall into that, we can only hope.
---
wtf how many behemoths is that 5? Ive never seen more than 1 in a group. Is this a Xbox thing?
---
No problem, thanks for the thought.
---
I'm at a loss too, that's why I'm here :)
---
Feedback (all platforms)
---
This might have been mentioned but change the cast iron stove or add a variant of it that looks like it's burning wood inside.
---
Better than putting it on top of a campfire:

maybe you should get a mic ffs
---
This is about the Dev Room, which already has things in place before hand so everything about it is done properly from the get go. We aren't talking about past mistakes here and yes they have messed up but they are showing that they care and they are making correct decisions lately. There is no reason to complain over the Dev Room seeing as the player who has gotten there has used a hack or file edit to teleport to the location to begin with; this location cannot be reached without knowingly breaking their terms of service.
---
I'd add titanium and nuclear material to the list for mods and upgrades. At the moment it's often cheaper to scrap armour and build new. But the patch notes mention blastic fibre will now be needed for both repairs and crafting. Perhaps a nice PC player can confirm.
---
Thanks! I did a cross lost over there
---
I'm 90% sure that they already confirmed that Private Servers are still going to be on Bethesda's servers, which means that you will still get all the issues from playing on public servers like latency or occasional crashes (even though crashes would probably be lower if it's something like 1 or 4 players), with the only difference being that you choose who can connect to that server and use mods
---
I just realized I haven't explored the whole NW part of the map. Go figure!
---
yep, morons the likes of yongnah and angry alejandro are laughable at best.
---
Most likely hotfixes, be nice if Bethesda would tell us exactly what they are.
---
I found one the very first day of the Xbox beta
---
I'd never heard of this creature when I suddenly started fighting one. It's body stayed after I killed it so I Googled it while looking at the body. Was just a complete chance encounter while jumping off cliffs as a short cut. One thing 76 really does undeniably well is make the other games feel like they didn't have enough enemy types. 
---
Also buy things from him somewhat quick because he will for some reason just drop dead after a bit. Even if nothing is attacking him he will just drop dead.
---
Me too. I ignore them. At least send me a friend request or message stating WHY you want to team up. 
---
Does this fix solve the duping problem currently mentioned on the front page?
---
Yay, i hope they finally fix duping. 
---
I tagged a bounty after lock picking a drop.
---
Nobody claimed my bounty for like 3 hours then i had a pocket full of junk in watoga and BLAMO ganked by a level 96 
---
There are baby mega sloths as well, that's what you found.
---
Nope. Plenty people have asked.
---
My boyfriend and I have been playing together! I loved settlement building in FO4 and he has been helping me get the caps together to acquire some of the fancier plans I’ve been gunning for. We finally scraped together enough for the neon lights recently and the camp is looking great. I specked up my repair skills because he prefers a melee build. Our strategy is usually for him to charge in and send everything running while I snipe from the hills. 
---
We’re approaching our 7th anniversary and our lives have been really busy lately, so spending a quiet night in making cocktails together and playing Fallout when things are calm has just been like heaven. I think it gives us some time to relax and connect as a couple - and I guess nothing bonds you to somebody like running screaming away from a couple of scorchbeasts. 
---
He bought us a second PS4 just so that we could play together (and like another person in this thread said, so we can do the same with Anthem when it comes out!). I highly recommend this game to other couples if you can spring for the setup!
---
I have done as you say, but I don't see fallout classic in the store at all, I can't even find an option to purchase it.
---
By like 3 miles for Shenandoah and even less for the Blue Ridge(down in Giles County) 
---
There's a few weapons you can't use while in power armor. Also some people play more into the roleplay aspect of the game. And sometimes you just wanna try different builds. 
---
How could you even have 50+ Nuka Colas without dipping and why would you drink them in batch unless you are just converting your duped colas into caps? There's no cola you need to batch drink except for maybe a couple at a time when sprinting to keep up your AP.

I got small letter plan inside Silo Charlie.  Sitting on one of the tables where you repair the modules.

Was that what was causing rollback?

I LOVE LAMP!
---
The lore is too good in this game. If just the normal audience and critics would understand this...
---
whats the thoughts on farming stuff like springs ,gears etc then ?
---
It might have changed or that’s just how it is.  Uranium Fever used to throw hordes at me, now it’s like one enemy every 20-30 sec.
---
It is.
---
That dev room is tiny and injected into the memory via hacks.

When in there the entire game world isn't loaded

Genuine tip always put your hazmat suit on when in a rad zone that way if you need to get out for absolutely any reason such as crafting pure flux you can with zero consequence.
---
Not a clue im trying to figure out where i saw it but im sure its officially said by bethesda 
---
Got blinded by nuke didn't notice the ghoul run up on my then I killed my self with my [insert exploding weapon].
---
That’s what I want to know /u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
I feel like that explanation is total bullshit. I mean it’s literally just a text list of what items to load upon receiving in your inventory. 
---
A regular guy, surrounded by irregular people who just wants off the damn merry go round. 
---
Oh I can relate irl lmao. 
---
I'm pretty sure at this point the FO series has fans in all of the major titles that dislike the others.. FO, FO2, FO3 ,FONV, FO4 and FO76, have a chunk of people within each of those fan bases that HATE the other games. Starting to think that for a lot of players, FO will never be done right for them. 
---
It truly is! 
---
that would be so nice :)
---
Sounds like me and my wife playing, we play together also. We group up and do things like uncanny caverns and take pics together etc lol. I did get in trouble the other day when she zoned in late to my nuke dropping and it landed o her as she spawned in. Also I have to make her builds for her, sometimes hers end up better than mine lol.
---
When someone seeks revenge can they see you on the map regardless of crouching?
---
THAT IS CUTE! 
---
Do what I did, play the game. Discover areas or get familiar with resources so when you naturally find a weapon you like, you can specialise in it. Along the way you can help other players. 
---
Or set up a lemonade stand at Whitesprings like all the other privileged children waiting for fun. So they can farm strong weapons until they get bored.
---
Thanks, I am going to try that later this week on PC.
---
I’ll dupe your dupedar lmk
---
The notes are literally shorter than the URL linking to them:
---
"PC: Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability."
---
But, but, but... it was the dupers that were crashing the server! /s
---
I want one! 😂
---
Yup I've spent hundreds on caps on plans I was absolutely, 100% sure I didn't have.
---
If that’s the case then I don’t even know what to say. Something like player location is fine to store on an interval basis but vital in game things like levels, items, experience, etc. should all be database updated every time they change.
---
It's just a super low spawn compared to other cryptids. I've only ever encountered 2 and I've got about 200 hours in.

I knew it was an alien! Last one I killed I didn't get this clean of a shot but based on all the connectors and hoses on the helmet area I knew it wasn't just a biological entity but one wearing a suit of some kind. Nice pic!
---
They'll never say directly.
---
They could have just enabled tracking of ppl that do it and will ban later.
---
But they'll never say directly.
---
Sucks so many toxic players like that. Making my way of fast traveling discouraged haha I'm just trying to save on caps cause I'm constantly buying stuff 
---
Not on the regular map. They will see a red dot on the mini map. 
---
You can get fully kitted anything for half of this lol
---
Yeah, I've essentially only bought the photo poses and (quite unfortunately) the vault tec paint (I know, I know, I'm a moron, I actually hate the paintjob now...) and like... Why the hell can't sitting and lying on the floor not have some (FREE?!?!?) emotes.
---
I might just be saying free because I absolutely REFUSE to pay for atoms, but like, 60 dollar game.
---
I do trades with people and log out right after. Always saves the transaction for me. Had a guy blow up my base yesterday, was wearing godroll armor. Must have been a bounty but saw his wanted buddy on map fly across the map like some sort of speed hack. I should have recorded it was like he was a bird.
---
Yep looks like a cyborg zetan
---
Similar does not require killing the whole server, though - the previous method we had until the last hotfix would only disconnect the person in question. Unfortunately, they patched that, and so now people have returned to the method *before* that that didn't get patched, of give it to a friend, they log off, then crash the server in under three minutes.
---
Thanks, wasnt my intetion just wanted to tell my opinion.
---
Think about it, you are able to access your stash on all servers this means it is loaded from a central database so it is not just stored on one specific server. 
---
Loot items such as every world item container including the dev cell is loaded per server, this is why server hopping is a thing. It's not the same on every server. 
---
The problem OP is expectations. 2018 has higher expectations than 2007. This game looks, plays and honestly feels like an old game that got a remaster. The frustration comes from unmet expectations. 
---
Its Modus he's running everything behind the scenes. The blocked off area in the enclave bunker he says isn't ready yet, is hosting the brain of the first scorched who controls the hive mind. 
---
Scorched Robobrains in coming. 
---
I honestly didn't even think of that but I love the idea! Maybe the strangler vines are from some sort of experiment gone wrong? 
---
I've killed 3 now... never near Flatwoods tho lol! 2 in the marshes and one near fissure site prime.
---
Funny thing is, these can’t breathe in earths atmosphere.  Confirming they aren’t zetans.
---
Only time you have to consider others is in PvP or you do a group event (Currently only thing you need another player for is SBQ)
---
I went from 2/76 to 4/76 recipes learned (but I have almost all of them so I'll never get to 76) and I was able to get Yuo Guai kills to count for killing different kinds of creatures. I think I got killing 76 aquatic creatures too (mirelurks). This is all post-patch.
---
But does it have a resource node?
---
Another tip from someone that exclusively workshop PVPs like this is to never go back to your camp when you have a workshop.  If you're obviously at a camp it is as simple as marking the map where you are and being able to destroy your entire camp without any bounty.  
---
True
---
&gt; PPPRRROOOOOOJJJEEEEEECCCTTT
---
Damn, cherry picker champ.
---
Like I mentioned in another reply, if I got a PSN message or invite with “want to fast travel to your location” I’d accept it. But without any details, I ignore them. 
---
I went to a defend workshop event because it was at a workshop I hadn't yet visited and I wanted to explore the area. After helping defend I asked the guy if he had a stash around so I could drop off some junk. He crafted one for me and in return I gave him a full set of plans for Ultracite Power Armor. He was level 59 so likely had the armour or would be getting it soon but being able to craft it is still handy. He was very grateful.
---
So I reckon it’s picking the lock that makes you wanted. 
---
Why is there always a rock or log or something behind you when you're running backwards!?!? Yeah you weren't escaping that homie.
---
Both 
---
It seems that hardened does the same damage as prime. How much more damage does it do against scorched?
---
Hopefully that means maintenance isnt too long then
---
you can collect it but it just becomes dirty water
---
Time to throw point into agility!
---
The bot babysitting (Patrol Duty) or Always Vigilant is a gamble event, the bot either does its thing or doesnt. 
---
I'm trying to pull together a chapter of the brotherhood, we are few right now but we can help wherever needed. Ad victoriam
---
1 minute late.  Septevar megasloth is faster than fatdan megasloth.  :)
---
oh cool, thanks!
---
Looks good, but what the hell is Poly-Fiber Power Suit? I don't have a slightest idea but I already want it.
---
We dont know for sure if that device is meant for breathing maybe it is maybe it isnt they also could be a subspecies of the zetans or some kind of hybrid since they have a lot of similarities
---
Solo. Level 33. I had just claimed a workshop when I noticed it heading my way. I learned the hard way that turrets can’t save you from everything. Wasted a ton of medical supplies and ammo, but got a really nice photo and a wing fragment for my efforts.
---
Hm. 
---
Well if that's the case, in some regard I am happy to be able to send a nuke rather quickly, but on the other side of that same coin I am disappointed at the difficulty because it is an end game activity. 
---
That being said, with nukes in the state they are in now, them being difficult to launch would pretty much make them undesirable since the rewards for going into them are underwhelming a lot of times. 
---
Wait until you are 50. There is a big difference getting the last crit perks.
---
I play on PS4 and for the last month I rarely see people taking over Workshops, let alone capturing them.  I think a friend of mine had a random level 145 fast travel to him, take over the workshop and one shot murder him.  Didn't get wanted either.
---
Meanwhile I pick locked a toolbox at a workshop (one of the pre-generated ones) at the Gorge Junkyard, didn't pay attention that it was already owned, and that got me a 10 cap bounty.
---
In my experience though, the workshops around the flatwoods area seem to either not be captured, or if they are, ignored by everyone in general.
---
Introcuding the Pip-Boy Mk 0.1000! 
---
More honest dupers, such as some of the groups collecting the best weapons to distribute them for free among the community, test and confirmed that some of the methods do break the servers. It's anecdotal, perhaps, but they're anecdotes from the people actually doing that.
---
That said, before the last patch, there was a technique that did not involve crashing the servers, only the user duping, and it's notable how much more stable the servers were. Bethesda patched the popular one but missed a previous one, so now everyone's gone back to that and the servers are shit again. Hopefully the hotfix they're introducing today either re-enables the stable dupe as an emergency measure, or found a way to cover the popular unstable one
---
Sounds like a pretty good idea. Would definitely be fun roleplay wise for my preacher/scorched cleanser build
---
I thought you couldn't fast travel while wanted?
---
Good to know !
---
r/titlegore
---
I am not trying to be snarky. I would just like to discuss this. I am not a programmer or IT. I have fiddled for years.
---
If they had such a Database and were storing Character data correctly then they would also be able to parse the data when people have issues such as items disappearing or "accidently scrapping/dropping". 
---
I have seen far too many people posting their responses from Bethesda stating they do not have the tools to attempt to even verify the problem much less correct it.
---
This has led to a growing assumption that they are periodically saving each character in one save file with no back-up and no capability to parse or evaluate it.
---
I absolutely could be wrong, I know that. But it is just leaving a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to how characters are treated here versus other Online games.
---
I just learned that plans have weight. I dropped 29 pounds of useless plans saturday.
---
Of course it could be. You can run a private server, but still have it authenticate to Bethesda, and have it serve up the cash shop. My company and many others run similar solutions for authentication to custom made software. Look up "oauth"
---
Basically, upon login, you'd still login to your Beth account. Your private server only accepts valid Beth logins. The same can be done with item purchases. &lt;atomic-shop-item&gt; only works for accounts that are authenticated, and have unlocked. &lt;atomic-shop-item&gt;
---
Wouldn't it be nice
---
I wish I could tell you that TheMormonFuzz fought the good fight, and the Super Mutant Behemoths let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but Fallout 76 is no fairy-tale world.
---
Honestly the base game is okay until you start playing it for a couple of hours. Stash limit ruins the game, and then after you figure out the exploit to go past it (if it still works) really ruins the Fallout experience, but that's just me.
---
Has that video been confirmed? because several people said that it was actually from fallout 4 and just made to look like 76.
---
wait, underarmor breaks pa stats?? i thought that was fixed a while back, or just the BoS underarmor. 
---
My wife doesn’t play but she enjoys watching me. She always likes when I get in intense battles or somehow makes a cool kill! Last night I just jumped over a barrier and shotgunned a ghoul in the face and she just says “that was fucking awesome”
---
Once when I went to loot a missile launching Super Mutant the inventory glitched for a few seconds and showed 56 missiles. It quickly changed to 2.
---
bethesda said that fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks later this month.
---
I am unable to repair some items. The workbench takes my junk when I try to repair the item, but the item still remains broken after wasting my resources. 
---
If you need steel and lead, abbies bunker, ella ames bunker, and raleighs bunker. All 3 will net you ~300 steel, and ~200 lead (among a bunch of other junk like screws, gears, plastic, rubber, etc.)
---
I imagine they'll be lipped on exploit patches going forward.
---
Liquid if false. 👎
---
Invite her to dinner and treat her real nice
---
If you have extras, I wouldn't junk them. They seem like they are too high level for a crafting material to have so few uses. I would hope they introduce more crafts using them.
---
Coffee is what makes it worth it, that is if you want coffee. 
---
I think pistol dmg only increases the physical dmg. Explosive perk only increases explosive dmg. While something like tenderizer or bloodymess increases both.
---
I'm not sure on this, needs confirmation.
---
Always 28 for me, but I don't do a thorough run, just the downstairs lobby
---
There is another door that is buried in the ground that you cant interact with the keypad for it.
---
&gt; I would buy it if the price was fair tho
---
It would also be nice to have a cure for cancer.
---
Pharma Farmer is another perk which acts like this, you never run out of any stims/rad away
---
At this point, does it really matter? FO76 is leaking on all ends, and for every plugged exploit they'll find another, because it's just FO4 with an internet connection. It wasn't made to withstand what people are throwing at it, because the base game also didn't. The devs never really fixed any exploits in FO4, because nobody cared that you could dupe/wallhack/exploit/whatever.
---
The main exploit really seems to be how the server treats "forced disconnects" and not even the methods themselves. Unless they fix that then the goal will always be "how can we force the game to disconnect us". I'm curious how this method works if it disconnects the whole server. Wouldn't everyone get kicked and rolled back? Or does it not rely on a world container any longer?
---
&gt; these can’t breathe in earths atmosphere
---
is there a source? just seeing them wearing helmets doesnt mean that.
---
I really don't think you understand how backend services work in this context
---
Follow up question, does the perception explosion size perk apply too?
---
A sword? Why not a spoon?!
---
Listen.  I don’t know if you understand how classifying a species works, but these are way to different to be the same race.  For one, these don’t have legs.  The tech is different.  They don’t share body composition, or proportions, or even hand 🖐 shape.  I’m going to assume that the fact that they either have a helmet, or a breather on that it’s safe to say they can’t breathe here for some reason.  Requiring two entirely different sets of elements in the air would make them completely incompatible for that classification.  Also, this is a good thing because we already know what Zetan tech looks like.  I’m hyped for this new shizz!!
---
I accept them, but if they don't talk then I usually just leave the party.
---
At least give me an emote or something...bah.
---
Rolled back is technically when data was saved and you get that overwritten. this just means the server isnt saving data at some point. 
---
Are they not one and the same?
---
14
---
I mean..you just described me also. Just add cat fur up in the mix also.
---
That does look badass it's too bad the presidential paint isn't much different from the black bird one :-(
---
Wrong, wrong, wrong.  It's because Bethesda are secretly experimenting on us to see how we react.  The Devs are actually aliens looking to give the community a good probing.
---
  If you are looking for a realistic shooter FO4 and 76 are not it.  I hope in future versions they tune it up a lot.
---
Sweet,  one more day to grind out my last few levels to 90.
---
Love it. My only drama last night was telling a kid not to use the word gay to mean stupid. Yours is more fun. 
---
Getting one is like opening a fancy ass knife in CSGO. I agree the guy he bought it from and the TSE's on the market are from exploiters. 
---
Cool it's actually something I have been wondering for a while, so it's good to know even though I missed the sarcasm!
---
Fallout 4 survival mode was one of the best experiences I have had in gaming, so it's sad to see this happen. Luckily I have stayed away from it since day one.
---
Solo around 40s. I used a building to reduce the damage from the Donuts of Doom**™** and it took me a while. After it died I felt a lot more safe and the game got a little less interesting. The fear of them until that point had me dodging and running whenever I saw them previously.
---
Ive had the opposite experience. Ive had asshole spam me with toxic hate that I must be a duper because of the equipment I have, and proceed to troll and just be as ruthlessly negative as possible while they destory my camp.
---
Its happened 3/3 of the last nights play sessions in a row. The obsession with duper has turned into a mirror of MaCarthy's red scare.
---
There are many legitimate issues that make a lot of the criticism well deserved. Yet the following happens:
---
* People take the negative facts and exaggerate them to 1000%. Like limited types of content due to no NPC dialogs is apparently "no content" in some broken minds. 
---
* People deny any positive information. Nowhere else can you read about the fixes which greatly improved the game. If you followed only the haters and clickbaiters, you'd have the idea that the state of the same is still the same as on release.
---
* People outright lie about the game when their mind is in advance set in Hate Mode. They are abusing the general clima surrounding the game, where any criticism is easy to believe beacuse "everyone knows the game is bad". So then people can spread lies like "No NPCs, no quests, Rust-clone"...
---
* People use double standards the size of Hoover dam here. They take the valid criticism and mark it as unacceptable and general justification for the hate, while other game with similar issues don't face these issues. Like the amount of bugs is apparently the biggest issue. Yet FNV had much much more issues at launch and even after last FNV patch there are many stability issues. So if crashes and bugs are the issue, why isn't FNV condemned at least just as strongly? Or these monkeybrains like to point out that the game is effort-wise a DLC for Fo4. Same engine, some reused assets. And the same goes for FNV. FNV is in this regard even worse, because at least Fo76 has the addition of multiplayer (which is enormous feature itself). And noone has issues with the effort put into FNV.
---
* People like to deny any defensive arguments by personal insults. They don't mind what I've just pointed about about FNV because the game is "fun". People don't mind CDPR and R\* abusing their employees because their games are "fun". But when someone defends Fo76 with "I don't mind the bugs, the game is fun", they start claiming that "fun" is not the important factor and that we are having low standards, buyer's remorse or are asslickers.
---
Basically, Bethesda deserves criticism, maybe even hate. But it's like getting fired/fined for going home from shift 10 minutes early when the other people do the same or even worse. Again, Bethesda deserves some criticism, but fair criticism which is weighted against criticism against other companies who do their shit. That doesn't happen. The internet has picked Bethesda as a lightning rod for their criticism against the industry and other wrongdoers have escaped basically unnoticed. The only other company who got lambasted badly was Blizzard. I don't remember anything else from 2018. AC: Odyssey XP boosters in single player game? Nearly nothing. RDR2 Online terrible MTXs? Nearly nothing. R\* employee abuse? Nothing! If these people are wanting to make the gaming industry better, they are doing it wrong!
---
I'm like for real about the podcast recommendation though. It's special when you find someone else channeling their silly so publicly. 
---
It's a podcast in two sort of parts, the first part the host interviews whoever their famous guests is for a bit, always a good talk. Then other guests come in as improv characters, and they all just talk nonsense for an hour. Improv is 90% terrible. This is the 0.1% gold standard. Top shelf authentic true talent silly mother fuckers. 
---
I can't fully describe it, you'd just have to listen, hah. Also a show version of it on Netflix with all 5 seasons. They go from a podcast into a sort of fake late night talk show setting with more scripted and focuses silliness. I adore it, but I do recommend the podcast as it's the basis of it and it's more current with an episode released every Monday.
---
Literally look forward to my Monday commute. 
---
Should be on the front of the actual gamebox
---
I stopped killing myself with explosive weapons
---
Yeah, somethings going on for PS4.  Got disconnected 3 times within an hour last night, and never had that issue before.
---
You people make me sick
---
Good tip, but in my early-game experience rank 1 was plenty, you can save the other 2 points for something else.
---
He was probably using mutations.
---
I have that as well. Just letting people know there are two prospector's hats.
---
I just found out recently that the buttons on top of the controller and trigger (XB1) let you change amounts MUCH faster. I was sitting and waiting to transfer 8000 bullets manually before...
---
Yeah tank buster perk helps. But sweepin the legs is key. Also.. dodging acid money shot is priority 1
---
I've been trying not to be too hard on them publicly, but it has been a frustrating experience for sure.
---
Do you have any other info on this bug? Maybe if there is a place Bethesda is aware of it, I could tack my experience on or something
---
No-one's telling you because it's trivial and is the oldest dupe method we knew of. Literally: give item to a friend, have them leave, crash the server by any means necessary to force a rollback of all characters on the server.
---
What I'm not going to help with is how to crash the server. But that is a necessary step, so yes, *duping is causing crashing now.*
---
Tbf the helmet could be to withstand the pressure, in terms of species like i said they could be hybrids because the head is way too similar
---
I hoard them. If 50+ Nuka Cola makes you are duper, that’s hell lots of duper out there. It weight light with perk and it sell good. I don’t need to worry about thirst. When I loot something that I like and overweight I drank them in batch to reduce weight. Not the best to get caps but you still get caps out of it. 
---
I actually have couple hundreds of it on me total and weight less than a heavy mod rifle. 
---
Thanks! I'm having a blast with this character. 
---
I keep all of them on me and at the end of the day (or when I just have too many) I jump to a low-level and drop them. OR I give them to anyone who was helpful during an event (and not one-shotting legendaries). I also have a weak spot for anyone emoting hello.   
---
I also ALWAYS train legendary enemies while furiously emoting. We're all grinding, might as well do it together. ;)      
---
^^^^Not ^^^^fishing ^^^^for ^^^^upvotes, ^^^^rather ^^^^hoping ^^^^others ^^^^do ^^^^the ^^^^same. ^^^^:)
---
Ahh yeah I really miss the in depth fallout 3 where I had to go find my dad who abandoned me, and only had one evil choice in the whole game to blow up a shitty city 
---
A YouTuber looking for clicks told him so it must be true. 
---
I agree the negativity has been blown out of proportion, but to be fair if you just got the game most of the major game-breaking issues have been fixed. When I first started it didn't support 21:9 aspect ratios, was locked at 60 fps, and there were a litany of little bugs that affected normal game play (guns that dump all your ammo in one shot, carry weight glitches that magically max out your weight until you restart, base building glitches that allowed you to build things you didn't have plans for or prevented you from building things you did have plans for, bases disappearing on log in and forcing you to rebuild them, etc.
---
The fact you all think DUPING is the reason for the servers being unstable is so jokes, telling me you’ve never experienced a disconnect or lag is just blatant lying because the game runs like ass.
---
Every decent software company reuses old code. You might not like it, but the Linux kernel isn't rewritten from scratch every few years.
---
Wow, that explains those team invites from nowhere. Thanks for the tip.   
---
Except for the (most likely) duped and bought TSE weapons it's pretty nice role play, I have to say. Raiders are essential part of Fallout world. 
---
didn't they have little legs inside the suit?
---
oof guess you were unlucky and couldnt find something to climb up on
---
I played a lot during beta and early on after release, but haven't gone back, and seeing all these stories like this are what's making me not want to go back.
---
When I was roasting people in my "Player Oven" camp I had someone message me and say I didn't know what "real pvp" was and that was the only way I could kill people since I sucked so bad. The reason they were in Flatwoods? They were level 140 "bounty hunting" some level 15 guy with 20 caps on his head, lol.
---
Been seeing that on Facebook since beta
---
Yea, that would be a bit concerning. 
---
Mega sloths are everywhere in the cranberry bog. I killed 3 last night.
---
I've only see one behemoth, and it was outside of Lewisburg of all places.
---
Wait scorched can be added to 3 stars? And not wipe the effect?
---
The "new" method is actually the oldest method, and works on consoles. Though you'd think they'd not be so stupid as to use the worse method while the good one works, as it's much slower.
---
Can’t say for sure sorry 
---
I've killed a couple mega sloths, I've seen one Mirelurk Queen and got killed by a king spamming his screech, and I scared off one mothman. Haven't seen a behemoth or flatwoods monster.
---
There is a better question buried here: why should I ever care about or want anything to do with pvp when there are droves of people lvl 200+ with tse shotguns and infinitely stacked bobbleheads?
---
Usually get one off dead assaultrons. 
---
That a lot of work for just 10 caps. Apparently it’s picking the lock that gives you the bounty. So you would have to call in a new supply drop each time and then go a wait by the box in stealth each time. 
---
What system are you on? If xbox, I can level you and craft you some excavator armor. Lvl 64 with nothing better to do lol
---
You had better luck then I did, only thing we got was a Scortchbeast a hand full of mutants, and scortched.  
---
Thank you very much!
---
You have to play the game since beta to understand, grabbing it now 2 months after release when a lot of major issues have been patched isn't going to give you a great picture of what players had to go through.  That being said once you have completed all the main/side missions the game becomes repetitive and boring.
---
I ain’t ever listen to one dem podcasts y’all youngins keep yammerin ‘bout
---
Read in an article all dlc will be free because of the shitty release 
---
Oh I didn’t think you were being snarky or anything. Just trying to help explain how these types of systems are supposed to work in theory. I’ve never even played this game but I do read a lot about the issues it’s been having. I don’t doubt that many of them are due to poor decisions by Bethesda, likely to cut costs, but there’s also a lot of posts in every one of these threads claiming things that are just completely wrong or not how online games work.
---
It’s definitely not simple to troubleshoot some of these things like claims of item duplication, even with a proper database, but it is alarming how many people seem to consistently be having such ridiculous issues with a game from a AAA studio like Bethesda.
---
Another thing that doesn't work for me. 
---
Now i have questions.. 
---
Without pacifist your not shown on the map? Did i understand that right?
---
And if im in pacifist, players get no bounty when destroying my camp?
---
Also couldnt you just dissconnect if someone wants to destroy your camp?
---
Do you have to pay caps to rebuild or scrap? Is it expensive to repair a full camp?
---
Sry for asking so much im kinda new to fo76
---
The only good legendary I've ever picked up myself is an exploding radium rifle, love it.
---
&gt; players are trying to play the game the correct way and have to deal with server crashes/rollbacks it gets frustrating to the point where you stop playing.
---
Tell me about it, I spend more time on this subreddit than in game. I'm still emotionally invested and I **want** to play, but I just can't bring myself to log in while the game is in its current state.
---
I was server hopping trying to find mods for my x01 suit. Finally found the damn calibrated shocks after hours and hours (over several weeks) of searching. Boom server crash. I lost the caps (not a big loss but still) but don't have the mod anymore. Idk, fuck it, I'm done for now.
---
If you want to avoid the gambling that a lot of these predatory bastards have been putting into games, Nintendo has been pretty excellent about not including that in their first party titles.  Just saying.  Nintendo is a refuge from all this garbage.  There is stuff out there besides Nintendo (at least until the studio responsible gets bought out by EA/Activision/etc and the sequel gets ruined) but honestly Nintendo stuff is just consistently good and always free from this sort of trash.
---
Personally, I also like to do a "self imposed challenge" in freemium games where I try to get to the end game without spending any money.  But I also refuse to purchase any game that offers a "freemium" experience with a $60 price tag.  $60 entry to a grindfest designed not to be enjoyable, but merely to psychologically manipulate me into spending even more money?  Hard pass, thanks.
---
Only for the patched method. For the current method you give the item directly to another person and have them leave with it, then force a rollback on the server to get your copy back.
---
The watchtower over the Cranbog has a fantastic view.
---
Fuck i hope they fix it
---
True but we have witnessed people doing even more elaborate actions.
---
Can't tell if this was meant to be funny but I laughed regardless
---
Number 3.
---
Me and a friend have killed plenty and not found any.
---
Let me drop the 18 cans of dog food, the 6 cans of cram, 4 seafood imitation, the 22 corn and carrot soup I made... Hunger in this game can be fixed pretty much instantly as their is literally food everywhere you go - it's better to use it as a stimpack as it restores 200hp - but then goes moldy wayyy too quickas the deterioration is bugged I think - I check the CON of my food and it's hardly going tdown at all for 30 mins - i check 5 mins later and it's "spoiled meat" ffs Bethesda!
---
At some point in between, the stocks of pre-war toilet paper run out. ;)
---
Looted it from a locked box.
---
I'm pretty sure the limitation (if it exists) is not the file size of storing the database.  But the processing power required to search the database every time a user accesses it.  The bigger the database, the more data in in per person, the longer it takes to search.
---
Whether or not it is the real or main cause would be another thing.
---
This!!!
---
Drives me nuts! Guy is clearly beating me senseless with a Super Sledge and when I loot him all I find is a 0 durability board... or guy is mowing me down with a gatling gun and when he dies I get a short hunting rifle, some 5.56 ammo and a femur...
---
Yeah your probably right, just thought it would be a cool thing to add. :p
---
So al of that shit I pointed out and your two “maybes” are enough to downvote my legitimate understanding of science?  Okay 😂 
---
I've only had one griefer. Followed me to my camp after queen event and started mini nuking my house. I politely left the server. But I do see a lot of people dealing with ass hats. Some little shit ran up last night and killed rare charleston vendor bot last night. 
---
Upvote for keeping it for yourself.
---
They do have legs, the post earlier had a glitched one and you could see short legs hanging inside of the chassis of its body. Its probably just a zetan that crashed and became injured, the suit looks akin to a mr gutsy’s eyes modified into boosters to act as an alien hover wheelchair. 
---
Or it could have been a defect or something but in honesty the real answer is that they didnt wanna take the time to make a new alien so they modified the old zetan models ingame to make the “flatwoods monster” which is an actual thing in real life that was reported seen after a UFO sighting a long ass time ago.
---
Nah that's the exact situation you'd be in if you didn't drop everything when farming like whitesprings or something.  It's easy to get over 4x your weight and be forced to walk.  Then you'd of course want to dump all that stuff off on an alt to get to running again.
---
Im 1.5 days in, so theres much a do. Will note this down, Thanks. 
---
Even Can-do Rank 2 still has a (I want to say brokenly) huge proc rate. I realized I am sitting on like 40 cans of Cajun rice and means amongst other things.
---
Its already a dupe sorry :(
---
you can
---
Try dropping a gun on the ground in front of you.  Sometimes they will pick it up, at which point they immediately get a huge increment of ammo (example: minigun = 500 dropped, although enemy technically has infinite ammo).
---
But yes, enemies are coded to have infinite ammo I believe
---
Nice that's like the best of all options, thanks for the info
---
I’m a melee build with a TSE shotgun. I can’t one shot scorch beasts, and it is helpful to have a high damage mid distance weapon to switch to. Maybe if you put all of your work cards into shotguns and explosives you can, sounds neat.
---
It stacks with EVERY form of creation except bulking.
---
73% upvoted, but all of OP's comments are downvoted
---
Riiight...
---
You said it, and yet you still ridicule OP for having an opinion. It’s quite selfish of you to attack some person you don’t even know for having their own opinion. 
---
Talking about grudges... I can’t prove it but I’m almost 100% sure you downvoted every single comment that he’s put on this thread just to spite him/her because you disagree with his opinion in the original post. 
---
Grow up, dude.
---
On PS4 maybe yeah, Xbox have none in circulation AFAIK.
---
I had a mic for a day, everyone I said hello too shot at me, idk if it was because i was a girl or low level, but I went back to no mic and running away from people and doing my own thing.
---
Assaultrons lol
---
Its still not an actual bossfight - theres currently only one of those :(
---
Everyone appears on the map regardless of pacifist mode unless they continuously block everyone on the server.  If someone initiates PVP with you through a workshop then everything you own is fair game for them to destroy.  You could just disconnect but when someone hunts down your camp like this it is going to come fast and without warning.  With explosive weapons your camp will halfway gone by the time you pull up the option to leave.  You pay scrap to rebuild and when you die in PVP you pay caps.  
---
On Xbox I'm afraid!
---
I can’t be a Khajiit though... 
---
Mule it if u can.  Need some stable for certain crafting.  
---
Add the carnivore mutation. Twice the benefits. 
---
&gt; it is not just stored on one specific server
---
Obviously it is; do you know how monumentally stupid it would be if they were storing, accessing, and updating every single person's stash, inventory, account data, etc. on tons and tons of servers at once? The amount of unnecessary network traffic by itself would create issues let alone all the potential for desync errors and several other extra problems that would invent.
---
Maybe the device is for searching the wasteland. These things are intelligent so maybe they knew that when the bombs dropped that the world would be radioactive and that’s there own protective suit. It makes somewhat sense since 76 takes place 25 yrs after the bombs and that they’d think they’d need protection against the rad

Get the herbivore mutation, and start a razorgrain farm. Razorgrain soup restores 60hp, 20% hunger, and 30% thirst. You won't need to carry food, water or stimpacks...only soup.

Workshop issues causing server problems.  It was in the notes
---
This is the kind of thing people say who haven't looked in a duper bag after killing them. Duped lootbags are orders of magnitude heavier than a farm mule. If you don't know what you're talking about best to stay out of the conversation. 
---
Definitely.  150-250 experience per capture, plus defend or retake event (if you were out questing and didn't defend) and plans, resources, aids, when ever you finish any of the events.
---
Very fast leveling.
---
I also got Brick, Barn, and Warehouse plans from them.  And stumbled upon Graham a few times getting the Advance Power Connectors and Powered Roller Door.
---
My camp is pretty great for a level 35 who has yet to trade with randoms to try to gather things I want.
---
I have been offloading my extra plans to my friends or in the Overseer's Cache in Flatwood church.  So many extras.
---
There was a post from the Beth community manager who said they're actively banning *third party applications*, not necessarily mods. Of course their official stance on mods is also *don't*, so it's a little vague. 
---
I haven't added any mods yet mostly out of fear, however I suspect they're busy focusing on duplication and exploits before QoL mods
---
OOooo, they should totally disable fast travel while wanted. 
---
I'd be down, but I'm lvl 64 and don't feel like having an alt yet. I can also just be there for support if you or the group gets into a jam, can't beat a quest, etc. I play every night for a few hours and can craft you guys PA or something. Not interested in voice chat either haha filthy casual probs

Where did you get that glorious piece of hardware? PLUS if your on Xbox I have 2000 caps to and a 1* combat knife (bleed or something like that) for trade!! (shaking paper bag in hand).
---
In all seriousness that is a great find, I have been trying to find something other than a 1-2* piece of armor, knife or cryolator or spear for 20 levels now. I just got to Lvl 70 and had a TS handmade for less than 6 levels now.
---
had my first 2 server rollbacks happen to me yesterday actually? really wierd, Bethesda needs to look into this.
---
Best of's can be a good place to start. That's how I found it years ago. Haven't listened to this years, but it takes the top 14 episodes voted by the fans and plays them, with a lot of bullshitting between the host and his BFF and suave motherfucker extraordinaire Paul F Tompkins. Try this link! It's also on spotify, itunes, whatever.

Theres not a race, the monster appears in different versions for game effect. Its ultimately just a throwback to a real thing like mothman. Theres only supposed to be one that exists the different versions are just a change in personality use.
---
Like the mothman, theres different ones but they all do the same thing except one attacks, ones passive and the other just runs away. The nameplates are more likely there just so the devs and players have a better idea of which version their about to fight with without having to pay attention to small details like eye color with the mothmans.  
---
&gt; Sure, but that has literally zero to do with how good (or bad) of a game FO76 is
---
Not sure why you thought I said that? Or why you should someone saying "seriously why would people buy rum from a video game company" indicated a poorly done alcohol made the game bad? 
---
A .dll file? Yea no that's injection. 
---
You might as well uninstall now - you just won.
---
Anyone have an update here? I've searched the recommended vendors and no luck. Read that plans are now called advance electric connections?
---
Maybe they knew the nukes would drop? Bc in the prewar holotape that talks about them they already have the suit
---
I wish. Then I could go about my business hording things and arranging them in my house. It took 76 for me to realize that was how I spent most of my time in these games :p

Pharma Farma is much better IMO.

Wow someone with brains around here.

Very well said.

wot you mean not everyone has a bunch of servers in their living room? Le Gasp!
---
in unrelated news, wtb 3-6U rack, prefer 4-post not telecom style
---
It’s an apt metaphor 
---
I knew it. Ever since the last patch every time I claimed a workshop not long after defending it the server would disconnect.  Good to know they put out a hot fix for it. 
---
keep grinding. im level 210. i've looted lots of TS weapons. A handful of explosives but never TSE. Or trade for one, but it will most likely be duped.
---
why is that?
---
I know that lagoon well.
---
Yes!
---
Whitespring kinda sucks for good legendaries.  I've found all my good ones just exploring or doing events.
---
I don't think the map is updated in realtime. Maybe a bug or something. No wasn't strange in numbers. He moved from top to the bog in like 5 seconds. I watched him fly with the map open. Maybe just some sort of bug I was seeing, didn't actually see him fly, it was his wanted red tag
---
But because it was so rarely done, bethesda never fixed it, but now there's so many desperate for their duped goodies (and for god's sake some of these people are duping shit like *plastic*) that they're resorting to it anyway and it's wrecking the server. Hope the hotfix is addressing the rollback.
---
Critical savy or better criticals ?
---
No, leave pacifist off so when someone does come after you, you can at least defend yourself otherwise they are just going to murder you with no chance at all until you do get it turned off.
---
When you take a workshop, if they start the capture process, you and all your stuff is fair game but so are they.
---
You absolutely can, if you realize it's happening before it's too late.  Most people don't know this can happen and get wrecked a few times before they figure it out.
---
You lose caps when they keep wrecking you, junk for repairs.

And no worries brother, I shared this exactly FOR people who are new or just unaware.  The more knowledge we have and share as a community the better.  Stay safe in the wastes!

I hear you. I try to put the kids to bed before I start fallout but my god they take turns going to the toilet, they want another toy, they want a book, they are thirsty, they are cold and it never ends haha! By the time they actually fall asleep I'm also in my bed and **IF** I play with them around I get so many questions and they keep asking for Lego Ninjago and Lego Marvel Superheroes all the time
---
if you're talking about the long rifle firing neon blue plasma, it's the alien disintegrator from the zetan invasion creation club

Plastic is ridiculously easy to get though. spend 10 minutes in watoga or morgantown high school and you get way over 100. 
---
I mininuked her point blank in the face. She did not stop complaining.
---
Lol.
---
Well when you one shot everything with an explosive gun, you always get more ammo than you fired....
---
Can we start our own faction... Maybe like a mob and we'll call ourselves The Family. It'll sound super cool, but in reality it's just a bunch of reasonably responsible adults with real jobs, significant others, and kids...
---
Hmm, not sure. Try putting the mod in the directory from the instructions and either editing your custom config or downloading the one provided. See if the mod works. If it does, great! If not, you're probably looking in the wrong directory. 
---
I just got it as well (paid 37 for the steel book with the skin for the controller and 500 atoms) and I can see why it gets some hate. 
---
I got disconnected several times from the server. It stuttered a lot here and there which is a massive bitch when you’re being attacked by hordes of Scorched or Super Mutants. One second they’re 10 feet away and the next they’re right in front of you and you just wasted a shot because they’re not where they were. 
---
I’ve seen a lot of glitches, like the ground looking like a broken display. Sometimes the things I kill gain all their health again and again and I have to kill them multiple times before they finally stay dead. Stuff floating in the air. 
---
I think it’s a good game but I do sometimes want to rage at it because of the bugs. 
---
I’d rate it a 6 out of 10 but I’m sure in 6 months to a year it’ll easily be a 8 out of 10. 
---
“Just when you think you're safe, you're not. That's how they always get ya.”
---
Their loot is randomized upon spawning, it's something like 3-8 bullets of X for example
---
They have their own NPC inventory with infinite ammo though. You can see it if you try looting enemies on a laggy server, you might see a protectron with 180 fusion cells or protectron with 600 5mm before it quickly turns into the player loot table. Even if you loot it, that stuff just disappears though
---
&gt; no logical reason 
---
If only everything companies did were always logical...
---
There’s also a theory that states that the aliens were the ones to drop the bombs as payback. It said something about a holotape translating the alien trying to get the codes to all American silos. If what we just said is true then this can heavily back up the theory

I'm gonna piggy-back this to ask, does anybody know a group or want to set one up, for Whitespring nuke farming?

This is what they get for not updating their engine
---
Dont like it but still bothered enough to comment? 
---
Just wait until they update the atom shop...
---
I'm unsure, if they are then that completely sucks, I'm on Xbox so I can't really modify anything. 
---
Exterminator 50 cal does the job in about 250 rounds. With all hvy gun perks, one gun army and stabiliser. 
---
Don’t forget to ‘tag’ for search. It’s easy to look over certain things due to weight without realizing there’s resources you need. 
---
Ever since I tagged screws, BF, gears I’ve yet to be short on them. It’s also helpful with plant life and when your new to nuke zones flora.
---
i just got my first explosive yesterday. Found a 1 star explosive western revolver in the watoga station vendor's inventory. I can't tell you how happy i was! i've been using a scoped western for a while as a sneak pistol sniper before i bash them so this was perfect!
---
I think the problem was that BETA wasnt long enough, and when it was happening they should have left it on for longer, started it back in Aug last year, and then had a server wipe with every update, but allowed the BETA players to have things like max level end game stuff, in basic terms a long BETA would have shown a lot of the issues, and the "little" exploits that people use in game, and the server wipes would have made sense. 
---
But im 100% with you the game is amazing, Im 100 hours into the game, The only other game(s) I have put this much time into is COH1 and LORTO (while still paid to play!) and SWG before Sony did that update!
---
Shit! 
---
Report the message so they can’t talk to their friends lol
---
Oxhorn is great, best lore youtube channel for Fallout in general.
---
I am more interested in the little cabin nearby.  Very interested.
---
Another example of PVP that makes me think, "Surely they didn't intend it to be played this way."  Even without damage exploits, and regardless of how legitimately acquired their gear is, there doesn't seem to be anything competitive about it, and it's enjoyable for only one of the sides involved.
---
There was a post recently where the current state of PVP was defended by the poster pointing out that griefing is simply raiding, and that it's meant to be part of the game.  And I'm sure there are arguments to be made for it fitting within the theme, so players being raiders wouldn't be out of place.  That still means their preferred experience results in damaging the experience of others who aren't interested and can't fully opt out.
---
Really hope they're switching to PVP/PVE servers at some point.  Preferably before private servers, if those happen, because I don't think renting a server should be necessary just to get away from griefing-focused PVP.  Can see it as not being the highest priority, with duping other other issues being a bit more severe.  Would be nice, though.
---
Scaling issue by the sounds of it, and not enough damage output, the more players within the area of the fight the higher her hp gets.
---
If there is a load of low levels that have no damage impact on her, its impossible to do.
---
Same here but I’m level 26
---
The scorched are a blight on Appalachia. I’m going to see if we can rally some more members. If you’d like, and if enough people express an interest, I’ll pm you the discord I’m setting up.
---
Make sure you favorite radaway, have plenty on hand, take some RAD-X.  Have back up weapons too so you can just swap.  
---
When I was in your range I'd find higher level people and follow them.  My last nuke zone run I had a bunch of level 30s stalking me. Made sure they got their hits in, took care of killing things off, revived them as needed.  A much better crew to run with than the people one shot killing anything in sight.
---
Huh, that's super weird!
---
I *think* it's 90% of base weight + mods.  The gun itself is probably a pound or less.
---
I remember people talking about private servers being on Bethesda's servers, but that reminds me of before the beta dates were announced. People started speculating, and eventually a lot of people (me included) thought Bethesda confirmed that the beta would last every day until the release, so they started using it as fact. I remember them saying they will eventually add private moddable servers but I don't remember much else. I currently don't have time to look at all of their interviews at the moment though.
---
I did it at level 36, level 2 lockpick skill, rocket sledgehammer, sniper rifle, combat shotgun-used a lot of stims and had excavator power armor. Took a long time! 
---
Well thanks for the post.
---
Those patch notes are absolutely WORTHLESS. Like it would have been funnier if they just said we did stuff. 
---
It's an[Incremental reinforcment schedule]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Intermittent_reinforcement_schedules) so get to grinding, you little lab rat you.
---
Is the quest bugged? I cant get ellas program to open the door in harpers ferry. Load master tape over and over and wont work. :(
---
So idea with a question.  With the updated ability to replace your camp fairly simply why log off the server and not just use the replace camp function.  now the question is if someone does damage to your base, will replacing it repair it or place damaged things?
---
I agree, but I also want to take the time to talked about influencers for a second. The majority of reviewers like to add other people's opinions and reactions to their reviews. Once you add positive or negative content to make a point that is not from your perspective, your review is no longer made by you and just makes it seem like you have an agenda to sell or destroy the game. I can't speak for the majority when it comes to bugs, but my experience was only a handful of non-game breaking bugs at the beginning, therefore, my experience was not like those reviews. I'm not saying we should ignore the problems, but if everyone uses the method of adding content to their video that didn't effect their experience of the game, then we all assume the problems are consistent. The average viewers are dumb. They will consume whatever the reviewer, or streamer, talks about because of their loyalty. That's like when a streamer is terrible at a game, blames it on the game, and his/her viewers agree that the game does suck.
---
Bottom-line: The game DID have problems, but people over-exaggerated and joined the hate train because it was a meme or to cash-in. Reviews from content creators are basically similar since they use each other's content to get the point across. It's difficult to find genuine and unbiased reviews now and days because controversy sells.
---
It was a play on a Peter Gabriel song.  Probably before your time.
---
I have no problem at all with grind. Ive played tons of mmos including everything you listed and FO76 doesnt even come close to them. Even vanilla destiny 1 and 2 had more content to grind which was decent and they still got bad reviews for it. Whereas FO76 has ONE. And its not even fun, youre basically playing a really bad zombie game in the same place over and over again. 
---
As much as GTAO open world pvp wasnt the greatest at least it wasnt as bad as FO76. There is LITERALLY 0 incentives to do any kinds of pvp. The weapons are imbalanced as hell. The slap damage mechanics gives a massive advantage to the person youre attacking.
---
He and others are probably thinking of like, wow-ripoff "private servers" or those nerds such as myself who have server hardware at home.
---
News for any of them who make it down this far: it's far more common for a company to *rent out* privately-owned servers, the way you used to rent a Ventrillo or Teamspeak server before Discord came along and destroyed all those business to monetize your metrics.
---
had one in my camp yesterday.  he also didn't disappear when i killed him.
---
&gt;If they had such a Database and were storing Character data correctly then they would also be able to parse the data when people have issues such as items disappearing or "accidently scrapping/dropping".
---
Except they *are* able to do that - items from the dev rooms have quietly disappeared from inventories. What they are not able to do is deal with the flood of demands to fix everything immediately that would come the moment they actually helped a player who lost stuff, which would undoubtedly be 80% scammers trying to get back more than they should, or stuff they never lost in the first place. They have to simply take a stand of "no GM interference in matters of items being lost".
---
i’ve seen her go down *once* during the last two weeks or more, even tho i’ve been fighting her among plenty of other level 60-150 players, and even that one time was only a matter of minutes. one time she glitched out so bad after 10 mins of fighting that she took off to the southern part of the map miles away from the actual border, we waited for literally 15 mins with no enemies to kill and radiation building up but she never showed up for the rest of the event.
---
at one point i started to feel suspicious if they buffed the queen even more because she is absolutely impossible to take down in only 30 mins, and with 10+ players she went down no problem but after some of the major updates there’s been just as many players but it’s just not happening. people dont even care to fight her anymore cuz it’s just a waste of time, ammo and stimpaks when she either glitches out or goes away after the event’s over
---
Actually I thought it was useful enough for what it was. I used it more for switching between weapons on the fly or using AIDS that maybe aren't hotkey.
---
Haha, not this computer. Maybe the next one. I appreciate the offer though. I just have to get to a power armor crafting frame
---
Realist statement ever. I almost forgot how everyone was blaming the carry weight glitch before all the duping talk started. 
---
And yet you post without knowing a thing on the subject :) 
---
Yeah they need to lower those atom store prices, its a joke 
---
You can. Move your actual CAMP device. The buildable area is a sphere around the device, so  moving it also moves the area in which you can build.
---
Unfortunately that is what Bethesda has become.
---
I had that issue I tested my connection and found it was my internet 
---
What I wanna know is,has anyone found the keypad code to the door in the building at the base of the tree?
---
Oof, yeah by about 10 years, my bad captain.
---
😂😂😂😂 a common misunderstanding and a lame joke. I can only apologise.
---
Yah it's what have me the idea. I've been rocking the excavator armor for a few levels now and I really dig it.
---
This could just be a pre-evolution of the zetas we’ve seen in the previous games, seeing how 76 almost 100 years before the original fallout, and almost 300 years before new vegas.
---
There are upgraded versions of even the light leather and light armor stuff.
---
Currently I am running around with level 30 Pocketed Leather (Boiled/Girdered/etc).  It gives decent armor, plus... the +25 carry weight for all the set.
---
To get other types, you have to find plans.  Randomly in areas or thru vendors.  Scrapping gives you (rarely for armor, it seems) chances to learn mods, but I haven't learned the actual base pieces by scrapping.
---
Also, just a note, seems that if you are making leather/light metal armors it is better to just remake them when they get worn out / break rather than trying to repair at higher levels.  Takes a lot of screws and ballistic fiber to repair, even though it takes NONE to create...
---
Omg I’ve killed tons of the two but never seen a flat wood monster. Tried to nuke flat wood to get legendary spawn but just ended up wasting an evening
---
Theres a hardcap on run speed. You can hit it woth the speed demon mutation alone.
---
Aaaah, Fallout 3...Still the best one, but 76 can top it, if fixed/done correctly.
---
Ok I’m on PS4 
---
They have fixed literally hundreds of bugs between release and when you picked it up, so it is probably a better experience now than it was prior.
---
Glad you love it!
---
Currently with the cargobot vertibirds, I start with my shotgun hitting every vertibirds engine (rank 3 enforcer) so they can basically bounce around like a air hockey puck without any steering. 
---
That would be funny/horrible if you could do the same to a PC transit vehicle.
---
Make sure you plan ahead as this won’t happen. Too complex technically.
---
Yeah the obscene amount of hate the game got is completely unfounded. Yes there were problems, and yes a lot of those problems have been fixed, but also yes more problems need to be fixed in the future. I think people gave the game so much shit not because objectively there was much wrong with it other than some light bugs, but I think people love the fallout series and Bethesda’s other game series so much that they hold it to a higher standard, and they want Bethesda to know that because we all love their games so much we wont settle for something that feels broken or just kinda half assed/rushed. I personally love the fuck out of the game but I do see where it coulda been improved. I don’t blame Bethesda, I figure time crunches and deadlines are a bitch, but i at the same time am hoping to see more out of them for TES6, and I think a lot of other players are too
---
I'm just confused as to why ps4 could have them... and not xbox?.. Do they not have the same content?
---
 **Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability.** 
---
They used to. I built one of my camps so I can watch the nuke drop from my roof
---
They announced from the very beginning at E3 that all DLC will be free, supported by the box price and MTX store. It's not because of a "shitty release."
---
Yes its the only thing that makes sense. 
---
My tooltip for Healing factor shows a minus thirteen percent to chems with my three ranks of Class Freak.
---
Finding plans either at vendors or out in the world, some events also rewards armour plans.
---
Scraping has a CHANCE of learning, just have to keep at it.
---
Play it legit for the adventure and fun and not for the grinding of levels.  Because once you hit level 50, that's it.  You maxed out your character's potential build.    
---
And you don't get more HP or stronger resistance after level 50.  A level 50 has the same base stats as a level 200+ player.  The only main difference is perk cards to shuffle around.  Play the game and explore naturally, because when you're level 30 at Watoga area, and all the Mr. Gutsy are level 68, you're going to have a more fun time trying to survive tactfully than a level 200 player who 1 shots them and is bored because the only challege they have is the scorch beast in the whole game.  
---
40ish... it attacked my Camp, so I had to take it down. Took me a few minutes and a lot of ammo. Took a photo for posterity.
---
LMAO, yeah I've been playing from beta and never realized you could fast travel when wanted. I've only ever been wanted once for unlocking a toolbox in what I didn't realize at the time was a workshop and had my friend put me down. Well now I know.
---
No.

I had this happen to me on PS4 the other night. Every 30 sec or so it was controls disabled.

Thanks! On console this option doesn’t let me submit a support ticket, it says “contact PlayStation” instead. I think I figured it out, though. Thanks again. :)
---
I usually send team invites only to benefit XP boosts, positive mutation effects and possible free fast travel. Only 1 out of 20 accept the invite.
---
I did not have sexual relations with that clown.
---
Once is happenstance,  twice is coincidence, three times is enemy action
---
Aye, thanks.  I run encumbered and therefore generally stick close to Whitespring, so the factions aren't a focus for me at this point.  I'm just grinding.
---
103 here, I've had half a dozen Flatwoods Monsters, including two on my last login. One group of three Fog Crawlers, one solo Fog Crawler, one Megasloth, and multiple Behemoths; the last time though I saw him in the water, and took him out before he could even start to engage. Two Hermit Crabs, and the first refused to die, as I used up all my big guns' and launchers' ammo - or broke them - and he kept refilling health on the last shot. That was an expensive lesson for me back at level 30 or 35 or so IIRC. Maybe 40ish.
---
I'm level 135, 215 hours in, and yet to see one. Ive also not seen a living behemoth, came across a couple dead ones that were presumably random encounters, as I checked those spots again.
---
Yeah, Royal Jelly is rare, even when you kill a horde of honey beast. Usually by the Seneca Lake cabins due to the Enclave Event
---
My exploding 10mm SMG is not that OP...lucky to kill 1-2 mobs after a full clip of 30 is entered into them. But otherwise agree that the big guns, lever action, handmade, shotguns, etc., can do some serious damage...
---
"Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will  hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for  issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans  Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to  address issues with some Perks."
---
If you mean that, fixing means repairing something broken. Not lowering or increasing their power.
---
It’s a random drop, so users on PS4 have them, someone duped them and they’re readily available.
---
On Xbox - (AFAIK) maybe a few or even just the one I have, were found and kept. So no duper has any to show - meaning the rarity and value sky rockets :)
---
Lvl 28 is a point where you need more levels for perks/gear but they come slowly. Excavator Armor is your #1 priority. If you're not relying on PA for normal play, be sure to get the defensive perks and get a Rad suit.
---
With PA, to be on the safe side, you'll need around 10 Rad X, 15 Radaways, 15 stimpaks, and several weapons...at least 3 fully repaired. You won't be killing much yourself, so just follow a group and tag enemies as fast as you can. Any rapid fire weapon (i.e., not hunting rifles) and moltovs are good for this. You can go around the resort about 3 times, then pick some plants for flux and call it a day.
---
You’re a dick. This whole Power Armor brigade of holiness is bullshit. The UI is terrible and everything is clunky. Y’all are assholes for thinking because you wear Power Armor in Nuke Zones that you’re better than those who don’t. Get outta here with that shit. 
---
How could you forget the most important thing? - The leak of personal information of many many people.
---
I can tolerate bugs, instability and so on, but I just don't understand how people can get over this like nothing happened.
---
Weird first time it's been like this for me 
---
Or possibly because the inventory can change several dozen times per second when firing automatic weapons. Y'know, 'cause ammo.
---
They need to keep the back-end more up to date, but it is quite unrealistic to expect them to re-save every time any player's inventory changes.
---
They should implement that! 
---
Wait.  Is this whole game just a computer simulation?  These guys are just maintenance men sneaking into the simulation, and we stumbled upon them.
---
Or give it to me and I'll tell you dirty things in French !
---
I just don’t understand, I have a three star melee weapon and all of my perks in melee damage, plus bloodied, and I’ll wade into battle after taking some dmg boosting drugs, I still feel like I just don’t do enough damage
---
Gotta get that 20 caps to buy more tse weapons man. Gotta be like everybody else in the game. I was at whitesprings nuke and a dude was going around trading with everyone to show off his guns. Messaged me and said "that high level and you ain't even got an armory" like he got all those guns as drops. Lol. 
---
Thank you my dude - if it helps it’s still a heavy ass gun after mods because they don’t count on the effect😂reload speed or faster ads are probably more useable!
---
Still no proof other than a site and video claiming mods can get you banned without actual evidence backing that up.
---
Do you know if they have the potential to spawn legendaries? Would be a nice way to grind 
---
Eh still its the higher leveled enemies same as SBQ best thing you'll get until new worlds dlc
---
&gt;**PC**: Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability.
---
This doesn't sound like they're fixing duping. But whatever they're doing, hopefully it works this time.
---
Also there're a good amount of gold and crystal veins in there. Great place to bring the excavator.
---
I found them in a random toolbox yesterday in the cranberry bog. I’m just now realizing what a great find it was.
---
What platform are you on
---
Do you really believe that there are that many duppers? And they are the reason for constant crashing servers? Lol
---
They've fixed duping a few times now. They'll probably find new ways.
---
Nope. As shitty as your advice to simply purchase micro transactions is, you are also incorrect. Have you tried having more than power armor chassis in your inventory? How about in your stash? The logo disappears immediately. 
---
Haha my phrasing was poorly thought out. 
---
My favorite is when they're not even carrying the weapon they were just shooting.
---
Happens constantly to me too.
---
I REALLY want to know what causes this.
---
If there ever is a time to get it right, it would be when talking about your wife. Thank you, next.
---
No, but CAN YOU HEAR THIS? IM TRYING TO SHOUT VERY LOUDLY!
---
Thanks for making the cleaner answer. 
---
&gt; Because of how the damage formula works, each source of armor ignore always gives the same amount of increased damage.
---
While true, this is amazingly silly.  
---
Scorched: "I don't have armor"  
---
Player: "Get reduced anyway!"
---
I’m level 89 and just a lone player most of the time. A level 21 and 11 player added me to their team near Camp McClintock.  Just a couple of young boys.  Sounded 12 or so.  
---
It was entirely wholesome and fun. Moved my CAMP so they could craft and such.  Traded a bunch of ammo and whatever I could lend for their levels. Gave one a lvl 20 two shot .38 rifle with suppressor.  Played in a few places before I had to log off.  My daughter listened in and immediately blushed because it was so cute to her. 
---
To hear a kid fighting super mutants and curse awkwardly was so wholesome.  Cracked me up. Made a friend. 
---
Sometimes random team invites are good also.  Hopefully the haters will get bored and leave 
---
Probably to cover their asses cuz they knew how badly they screwed up before hand LOL
---
I have got it at least 4 times from workshops.  I leave my spare plans at the workshops now.
---
Got a tse pump action shotgun from Uranium Fever, but sold it to another player for 5k caps and bought a TSE 50 cal machine gun instead. Much better weapon.
---
I just don't get PVP at all. It's not immediately clear what the rules/outcomes will be in each instance. It's difficult to understand what's going on half the time.
---
Also, in the beginning there were missions that you just couldn't complete due to bugs, and in my case my missions would either disappear forever when I'd log out or complete on their own without my actually doing them. I missed out on so much of the game because I played from the beginning.  
---
But you haven't yet been playing long enough to get to any of the most frustrating problems that still exist in the game. Like going to launch a nuke and getting disconnected from the game. Or being stuck in a loop of farming for mats because you need other mats and not really being sure what you're doing it all for because you've done all the things. This game has a huge map, but not nearly as much content as FO4.
---
Yeah people are like “The BoS are bullies” as they protect Appalachia from the SB’s, where the Enclave are over in a corner being actual super villain levels of evil.
---
No spoilers or anything, but if you’re annoyed at no human NPCs there’s one big cause...
---
:V lol
---
Over the weekend i noticed a player around my level in a part of the map i had not been to. Figured, what the hell. Sent him an invite, he accepted. I fast traveled...  We ended up hitting it off and killing stuff/questing till like 2am. Turned out to be one of the funest times i've had in game.
---
Haha! Instead of the constant hammering the sound should be a series of angry moos. 
---
Might be a treasure map hunt
---
but who is buying duped leather?
---
It's with the way Window handles files, versus consoles. Windows supports delta patching, meaning you can change parts of an existing file, while consoles do not, requiring re-downloading the whole file even if the actual change is small.
---
Yeah, those were my thoughts as well. 
---
The way 4LC is worded makes it sound like, at rank 3, it should trigger fairly regularly, but that doesn't really make sense, as it would make psychopath completely inferior.
---
Yes, and demolition expert will buff them too. 
---
I'll have to double check, but I don't think that works. I think once you've set it down the first time, moving it is restricted to within that area, it doesn't alter the area.
---
Quick questions: Does it tell you when you get/have a bounty? Also, does it ever go away (like the GTA bounty)?
---
I would like to see his answer to this?
---
thx
---
If it helps, I saw my first one in the upper right part of the map, about as far from Flatwoods as it gets
---
I received the debuff once, I did not. Test further or look into how, but I do know that I shot at my friends camp, and in order to be able to join their team I told them to kill me for the bounty. We still could not join teams, and I received the debuff. So yes you are likely right. Thanks for the better explanation. 
---
I prefer Italian ;)
---
I think that is it. It seems all games that are updates for pc and console the pc update is always seems to be much smaller.
---
jeebus why do you have 20 bulk leather. my stash box hurts just thinking about that.
---
Maybe the Zetans will be apart of the Vault DLC. If so maybe that’s explain why it’s empty
---
I’ve had mixed results with the quest rewards. I’ve received Bunker Buster, Perfect Storm, and Last Bastion with level 50. However, I just received Voice of Set and Blade of Bastet, but both were midrange levels. I think I got plans for one or both of them, so the expectation might be that I’ll have to craft the max level version. 
---
It's a Bugthesda thing
---
Merde...
---
Yeah. It's not quite what I was hoping to see, but a hotfix so soon after patch is one of the first real good signs I've seen.
---
Na Bro you get it wrong :D he want to dupe some more TSE Weapons with the leather 
---
Xbox one
---
The ones I nuke silos drop all kinds of circuit boards and heads 
---
Anyone mind coping in the Patchnotes, their page is not mobile friendly.
---
Or other stuff
---
Wow good job you did something that ISNT HARD AT ALL. Good job. Enjoy the jerk off sesh these bitches in the comments will give you.
---
Which airport? The one by Morgantown, or Charleston?
---
Common material used in duping picked like 800 out of some bag and ended up selling like 1000 for 2000 a while ago and asked friend why someone would want to buy it for that much and he responded with that
---
Can confirm. Happened after each time a nuke dropped 
---
&gt; you also get a lot of canned coffee
---
Sold.
---
Or they should make vertibirds that you can fly, because for sone reason I’ve always really wanted a car in fallout and a while ago tried to get mods before realizing I’m shitty with computers.
---
If he duped or thought he may have bought a duped weapon it’s quite possible that he just wanted to get rid of it. Or he may possibly have a good business selling deep pocketed gear to low/mid level players when carry weight is particularly a burden. I’m sure he had a reason for it. 
---
This could make alot of sense, maybe they have evolved by using humans as subjects/experiments to help breath in our atmosphere over that time.
---
In mothership zeta (fallout 3) they've  been abducting people for centuries as there was a samurai but he doesn't say what his abducter looked like.
---
Maybe they originally looked like the flatwood monster and evolved into their form in later years. 
---
Intriguing theory, I like it 
---
I am so sorry that happened to you but I am laughing so hard at this 
---
Nah, the rest of the country is still using pre-war cash, it isn’t for 200 years that the Appalachian custom of using bottle caps takes hold. #headcannon 
---
i was in on a Morgantown nuke. it was me and some rando i picked up to share perks with. there were a couple other people there in the beginning, but they left. we saw very few glowing ones. spent the entire time there and not a single legendary. we would run into 2-3 at a time, with an occasional jump to 5-6, but the great majority of the time was spent walking around.
---
If we get enough interest, I’ll pm you the discord.  Sounds like you might be a solid candidate for the Fire Breathers.
---
Its my favourite.
---
I’m talking about how we play together, if I were really talking about my wife it wouldn’t be in a fallout reddit. Any reason you feel the need to correct me on something when everyone else is just doing their thing? So again, next. 
---
&gt;Flatwood monster, mystery revealed 
---
&gt;doesn't reveal any mysteries
---
Nice one, chief. 
---
what? how?
---
Oh. Yeah, I know I've seen some weird glitching on the map with my teammates. I would definitely assume it was the map and not the player.
---
I see the confusion. Dupers buy leather so that THey can dupe other stuff. I’m not familiar with the process but know that they drop wood and leather in a bag, then proceed to drop what they want to be duped. 
---
Ever kill a duper? 
---
You’ll either get a ton of leather and wood, or so much more
---
I will take 
---
I’d recommend investing into the Ghoulish perk and Rad Sponge. Ghoulish replenishes your health while receiving radiation while Rad Sponge will heal a certain amount of rads each time it kicks. Note that Rad Sponge only works on another player unless it’s shared in a team. I started using these 2 perks and I rarely every have to use stimpaks or radaway while in a nuke zone.
---
no problem man! that could explain the breathing apparatus and the suit! 
---
It’s a weird algorithm imo. 
---
Original un-modded weapon weight down from 100% to now 10% weight.
---
Any weapon mods now add weight not affected by the effect. So you now have a 10% weight of the base Handmade + any mods you add are at full weight.
---
Dumb🙃
---
I've been using this for a while with a 15 agility pistol build. These are a few things I have found with the trick from my own experience in PVE:
---
\- The window for pulling this off on a charging enemy is very small (less than a second most of the time), so if your mid combat and drop down, take the shot as immediately as you can. After a while you will get a feel for the sweet spot for drop shotting mid fight.
---
\- From what I can tell, the sneak perk does widen the window for success, but not by much. If you have spare room for it then by all means throw it in, but it's not an essential part of making this work.
---
\- Sometimes the window is so narrow that you won't visibly see the sneak text update from \[Danger\] &gt; \[Caution\] &gt; \[Danger\], so pay attention to the sneak attack confirmation in the top left to see if you have hit instead of wasting time seeing if you're hidden.
---
\- As with sneaking, enemy perception plays a major part in this technique. When you drop down the game has to refresh how well the enemy AI can see you, so this still takes into account factors like light, geometry and noise even if you are mid fight. This is why some results are inconsistent through all these factors combined. But drop shotting is still very doable for the most part.
---
Hope this helps if someone wants to give this a try. Feature or bug, it does feel satisfying when it works!
---
Meanwhile the griefer uses his tse weapons to attack with lol..
---
Give the game more time. Last night my friend and I played for roughly 5 hours and:  
---
• we disconnected once, temporarily lost connection to server and “lost controls”  
---
• had to kill 2 wendigos because his quest bugged, so when he picked the item up it showed the location marker on his character. When he loaded in again there were 2 copies of his character for me: one naked slender man version at the entrance of the cave, and his actual character was invisible running around inside  
---
• we now do a “drop test” because the world has eaten 2 of my weapons and my hazmat suit, so we drop a junk item first to test it won’t be eaten then drop the actual item  
---
• I had 3 players try to trade with me. This didn’t happen until the hacking/dupping crap came out, and I don’t trust anyone anymore. One player specifically was decked out and walking around my little crappy camp. I declined his trade initiation and he destroyed my base  
---
• had to have friend craft my weapon because no matter where I put my bench it was just showing the animation and no menu showing  
---
This isn’t including the obvious frame rate and lag issues. The games great and I love it, but there’s a *lot* of issues that need fixed.
---
k, thanks
---
I think technically it was
---
I haven’t had a lot of server disconnections lately but I have had one or two blue screen crashes every session in the last week or so. It’s pretty frustrating. 
---
&gt; he may possibly have a good business selling deep pocketed gear to low/mid level players 
---
this sounds reasonable imo
---
So you shop at S Mart i see
---
Damn was gonna offer to help you with a new x01 set but im ps4
---
I've been switching in the charisma perks that suppress enemy damage output and tag them to take extra damage. 
---
 It sure if it's doing much but I'm thinking so. It says something like 15% extra damage taken. When everyone is firing while she's landed is a good time to use it 
---
Step 1: Deploy GECK to create more habitable land for rebuilding society.
---
Step 2: Launch nuke at it to see if it spawns more legendaries than Whitesprings.
---
 \- Most of Fallout 76's playerbase
---
Nope. That means if you get the zealot version which is 30% damage to scorched and add the scorched killer mod, you're in for some decent damage to scorched. 
---
No I am on PC and in Australia.  
---
Well yeah but they’re sad people who are even sadder when they come up against the kamikaze Fatman/orbital strike house demolish build. 
---
I can confirm that non-explosive heavy guns like (.50 cal, minigun, gatling gun) with explosive bullets are buffed by the non-explosive heavy guns cards and demolition expert too. For some reason a Gatling Plasma with explosive bullets is not buffed by demolition expert card. Dk about the Gatling Laser.
---
I have noticed that some enemies will hunt you down no matter how hidden you are and even when they logically should have no idea you're even in the area. I find it very irritating. But because you've somehow triggered them to spawn (I'm guessing), they have it out for you and will pursue even though you're hidden and they should not know you exist.
---
What's your gamer tag I'm on Xbox let's play 
---
No they haven’t. People keep claiming this but there’s no statement from Bethesda saying they can’t track duping.
---
The only thing even close is customer support saying they can’t restore lost inventory, but that’s typical policy for online games. Not an indication they can’t track items.
---
I don't want to publish duping but maybe YouTube gives you the answers you looking for 
---
so that i could trade for a tse handmade obviously
---
Btw i was by myself. No extra spawns for more ppl.
---
Shits harder than sqb
---
Fair enough. What is the plan named?
---
None of my chapters knights think that, we help responders (literally anyone in responders gear) by giving supplies and shelter, Raiders and enclave are shunned.
---
We lost alot of good people at huntersville and with the scorched/strangled spreading we need to band together.
---
&gt; Scorched: "I don't have armor"
---
Everything has "armor" though but as I mentioned if your damage is high enough it can negate it anyway.
---
A lvl 1 Weak Feral Ghoul has 5 DR. If you deal more than 35 damage the damage coefficient is already 0.99 do added armor penetration doesn't do anything.
---
High level enemies have 150-300 damage resistance though, so it's almost always relevant.
---
killed the queen 2 days ago in like 5 min just dps man and how many people are there we had like 4 ppl join my group of 3 and every one was 50-80 range except me and my team mate with explosive weapons.most people are to busy looking for the legendaries she spawns to kill and notdd bother with ths queen
---
GAHHHH! Blocked at work!
---
I just want a companion or a pet so I have someone to talk to
---
It happens, but in my experience thats not the norm. One time she was super scaled and she didn't run away after the timer expired. We fought her for a good hour, broke so many weapons too but eventually killed  and looted her. 
---
The best thing you can really do that I've found is to put the halfwall around the staircase, but I don't do it anymore because my house is too small and the wall blocks me off from my bedroom uostairs.
---
But then they need to add the dev room back in any time they need to do testing. It makes QA testing a lot easier than having to constantly look up and type codes. Using godmode for replicating bugs makes no sense.
---
A lot of online games have rooms like this. They just aren't accessible without cheats. It's practical, logical, and efficient to just leave the room in the game in a place that can't be accessed. 
---
*sigh* Here comes my standard reply that I basically already know the answer to...
---
“Is this on PC or console?”
---
Thanks for clarifying.. Always wonder about all this chit chat regarding this... But have yet to see it.. Now I know.
---
Technically Two Shot...
---
Haha not really I use a non-legendary combat shotgun mostly because I'm bad with caps and unlucky in love (of legendary weapons).
---
I'm a guy and i made a female character, and on my first session, at like level 3, a player started staring at me. I assume he was talking, but, no-mic me couldn't hear or respond at all. So i walked away and did my own thing... and he followed, even jumping in front of me, blocking my view! So i fast-traveled away... and he fucking followed me! So yeah, people can respond weirdly to the presence of femininity.

Level 310 and no TSE's and only 3 explosives, 2 are black powder pistols..
---
I think there is a seeded RNG that is not effected by luck, some people seem consistently "lucky" and others get 9 Nocturnal pieces of armor in a row
---
Yeah the PVP/bounty system needs a lot of work. It really does feel tacked on as "Oh crap its multiplayer with guns, we need to let them shoot each other somehow."
---
That being said, i have had some amazing PVP engagements (with and without TSE weapons) in Whitesprings while a nuke was going. Where multiple times we've all stopped farming and just started murdering.
---
My bf and I play, we're moving pretty slow (only level 20 + 24) with everything else going on in life...but it is a lot of fun! I put in more hours, but that's just because I am plan obsessed and try to clear out the 3 vendors I have access to daily.
---
I played a lot of settlement building in FO4 so I pretty much knew what junk was valuable and made the mistake of coaching him on it.....now he steals all the hotplates and fans and ammo bags before I can!
---
Someone tried to do this to me a few days ago, Even though I was a level 80 at the time I had better guns. Killed all 3. They tried to come back once more. Didn't end well for them.
---
 Morgantown.
---
This might be a dumb question, but you're inspecting each drop (R3) for second and third legendary diamonds when you pick them up, right? "Explosive" is never the first affix, so you'll never see an item named as such; it'll always be the second affix. Additionally, many of the legendary enemies at Whitesprings are one star, so you have 0% chance from them.
---
I find a relatively healthy amount of explosive weapons (maybe one in 15 or 20 ranged weapons), but I try to get them from Uranium Fever (lower level but still great if explosive), AWOL Armaments, etc.
---
Do check again, I may be wrong. But I think the area changes once you place down the camp.
---
Wait until you get disconnected a lose all your shit, or that workshop you spent caps and time obtaining gets lost, or a quest you are over an hour into gets completely reverted back to step one. It's definitely not just a minor annoyance. Claiming workshops was supposed to be one of the biggest parts of online play and no one bothers with them anymore.
---
It doesnt work like that you have to reset the CAMP by paying in order to move the build-able area.
---
I guarantee most of the hate for this game has come from the single player care bear community that didn't  want a fallout multiplayer game.
---
I am a woman, but fail hard at feminine.  I just wanna run and gun like the boys. (Well punch stuff in the face, but that counts doesn't it?)
---
I'm on XBOX, and I've never ran into that issue.. I think the Xbox server updates in real-time, but I could be mistaken. I've gotten disconnected while picking loot up, and it's there when I log back in.  Are you PC or PS4? I'm wondering what the server save time is on those systems, and what kind of factors can play a role in the loss of the data. Either way, that sucks really bad. 
---
Cool I'll have to have a look around that area for myself 
---
That's radx
---
Sounds like a great idea.   I have a bad habit of buying plans I apparently already know, and could use a good group to help me find food homes for them! 
---
Leather Poodle skirts for his band.
---
Good luck rebuilding a pointless in game faction. You'll see a lot talk, but you wont see any action from these fallout users. Dumb bitches.
---
What console are you on lol I could have something for ya 
---
Thanks..  
---
.,,,And that's it?  
---
Since last weeks patch CTD'ing constantly, which is weird since it seems to have fixed it for some, made it worse for others..
---
Pointless.
---
An explosive pump action without two shot can still kill most things in one click with right perks. They are so insane.
---
And often you can get multiple kills with one click.  So easy to farm.
---
didnt realize we were offline
---
Doorways work at the top of stairs
---
yup, also: if you get a gat laser prim receiver plan, when you upgrade cores to it, try and use up low dura cores as it full+ charges them, kek, with my prime gat plas I made a core that had so much durability that the gatplas broke before needing to reload....from full HP
---
Do people really have a problem with this? I have duped a shit ton and spent hours and hours in my camp, and only had one person approach me. 
---
What you want is to find out what your build will be when you are maxed out. You might have to pick other cards to fill in, try to fill in cards like crafting, group, barter(vendor). :)
---
bahaha, u missed the bit where i am a chick.
---
It is duped. And you're a little bitch just like the rest of these pussies on the sub. "Look at me so self righteous, me no dupe!"
---
Same, I thought the scorchbeast was a glitch and seeing as how all the Gutsys were attacking him...I was not about to complain.
---
There were limitations in fallout 4 too. There was a problem iirc where too many items in a container or cell would render the save corrupt or crash your game. 
---
LMAO.
---
TIL that EST time means Standard and not Summer... 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJHmsByTDjI
---
This video explains it pretty good. 
---
nah, this game totally feels like an online mod of 4 without any true story put into it. the lack of human npcs to deal with just ruins it as a fallout game
---
Is this real??  Please let this be real!!!  Hurray!   Remember the first time in Diablo III where you get teleported to unicorn land?  Such a funny contrast. I love things like that!
---
How'd you get it ?
---
do you even /r/fo76?
---
Thanks for the comments, much appreciated!
---
How are you keeping yourself occupied? I hit level 50 and I was done all the quests. I don't even see anything to do other than the same events over and over or grind for weapons that will let you kill monsters faster than you already can.
---
The biggest thing I have noticed is crashes to desktop, mostly in nuke zones.  Sometimes you get back in, run 20 feet and back to desktop.  This last patch was crazy bad for stability.
---
Please pm me if this ever takes off. I love the whole responders aspect of the game and would enjoy more people to play with on the rare chances I get to play!
---
Being trans does not make you a chick. It makes you a guy with titties. Plus, you just admitted to being shit at every video game.
---
This poor bastard passing up perfectly good workshops.

every time i notice i have 3k steel and clean out my stash i will immediately find a plan that needs ALL THE STEEL IN THE WORLD. 
---
I just sold all of my steel the day before yesterday then yesterday got the plans for x01 so had to spend my evening farming steel
---
It was just one very long disconnect out of many. 
---
Yo...I should start doing that. Not selling it or whatever but just helping people out.
---
&gt; With how things have gone I'm not so sure their original post-launch plans have survived intact.
---
Agreed.  Bethesda's gotta be questioning how much more good money they should throw after bad.  Seems incredibly unlikely the game is selling or MTXing well enough to even recoup ongoing costs.
---
Mine does, it looks like this purple shit [https://i.imgur.com/Pswypi3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Pswypi3.jpg) but instead its red

I know that on a previous character (I messed up the load-out so have re-started since then)  I met a fairly low level player who stumbled across my camp. I had some mats spare so I crafted him a full set of sturdy deep pocketed gear while he used my workstations and dropped it in a bag for him along with some excess stims/Radaway I had. Ended up getting a message from him over Xbox where he pretty much freaked out with appreciation. An extra 50 carry weight makes a huge difference early on. A few days later I got a message from him saying he had something he wanted to give me. So I joined his session and he gave me something like 1500 caps he’d saved up (told me how much he wanted to give and to sell a bullet at that price through trade). So honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if there are people who trade in deep pocketed gear early on. 
---
same :l 
---
Thats how i was with melee. Although every now and then i would get a hit that did noticeable damage ot was not often enough. Most of the time i felt like i was just making the queen harder by being there while not doing my part to take her down. Now with the explosive shotgun even if sometimes i cant tell if im damaging the queen i know i can keep the underlings off the other players that are taking her down. 
---
Same here. I've come across more moth men than I have him. I haven't seen one at all.
---
and I've already DC'd within one minute.

GREAT FUCKING WORK BETHESDA!!!111111111111111111

hurr hurr no human NPCs hurr

On PC maybe. Didn’t reply to my response though which confirms how narrow minded you are.
---
Ps. You’re the only bitch I see here leaving neg comments on a random dudes post - you must have issues. Blocked.
---
been getting em solid with the pharma... in fact really would rather just get antibiotics... 
---
I had one chilling by my base at lvl 48 and I hit him with the gauss rifle a couple times but he teleported away but I think I killed him at the last second because a ash pile appeared and I got to loot hime
---
Please be real and take my caps!  I love this!!
---
Here's to hoping and fingers crossed.. My luck with drops is horrible.. RNGeezus hates me :-(
---
You make a great point. In retrospect I hope my post doesn't dissuade people from trying to play with strangers. I personally don't have any intention of stopping from accepting random team requests, anyway.
---
I saw one of these on a cliff above the satellite array you do for the mission you do for Rose to gain entry to Top of the World. I was like what is that. It was floating back and forth on the cliff. Glad I didn’t shoot it since I’m like level 12. I would have gotten wrecked. 
---
If you keep the gun, do not use it as a normal playing weapon. You will quickly become bored of the game. 
---
I like carno cause I keep inodize meat on me 
---
That's reassuring to know. Sadly I don't have a Nintendo Switch.
---
Yeah, the moment two weeks after the FO76 launch (around black Friday) when they were offering the game for half the price already, my heart sunk. Knowing that it's a triple A game that apparently didn't only take my money and my time that I'd have to spend grinding away to unlock his stuff, but it was apparently also designed to be a semi-freemium game that relies a lot on microtransactions. I just felt betrayed. Exploiting players who never paid anything for a game, that I can understand. But to do it to people who payed full price (yes GTA Online and Rocket League), is a bridge too far for me. 
---
At twin lakes there are a ton usually 5-8
---
Yet you guys still play. Switch games already to one that works.
---
Overseer cache in Vault Tec University

found the incel
---
I never use them and have a few. What u want ?
---
Wait.. you can chat on Xbox? 
---
i remember fighting enemies on a bridge before and it was like a slideshow, wonder if they ever fixed that
---
If something like "ironic gold" were a thing you'd be awarded now
---
I got a prime .50 cal plan from one
---
I don't know about the behemoth but I've come across a couple of sloths in The Mire. Specially the northern part. There's a mission that you have to kill some. 
---
I’ve noticed some stuff like that, low level player with bounty and a few high levels with tse weapons, you go for the bounty and for what ever reason once engaged with the wanted player the rest were able to one shot me easy, other weird thing I noticed was that there was a major issue with the server incorrectly tagging the correct player being the name of the low level player with the level of the higher player or vice versa 
---
Best post I’ve read yet. 
---
I've observed that happening a lot the last few days. I like PVPing at workshops and have been highly disappointed to arrive at one only to see it's gone from owned to unowned. There's no way allllll those people are disconnecting/crashing/logging off the moment I fast travel nearby.
---
We don’t have any kids. ☺️ Thank you, next. 
---
Weird, I've done that event 20+ times in the past couple of weeks and never gotten more than 3 scorchbeasts. Usually just 2. Sometimes even 1.
---
That's something I came across last night and was curious about as well, it let's you press a to interact but it doesn't let you put in a code. I'm really hoping they do more with that entire location. 
---
The last time i heard a dev say "fix" for something "broken" it was Chroma in Warframe.  
---
They said they fix the damage output, so it is on normal terms. Would have been fine, but not only have they nerfed him to hell with his damage, barely doing more than a serration now, but they also nerfed his armor to hell. He feels squishy as shit now.  
---
So i hope fix means bugs that legendary mods have.. not nerf.
---
I did though
---
sry m8. didn't read your message. I am on pc but very thanks fot the offer
---
Traded with a dude for special bloodied gear. He isn’t a duper I know him well so can say that with confidence.
---
Well that's just not true.
---
Their the only team responsible and if ppl actually understood that they wouldn't make stupid suggestions like asking zenimax for money to fix the game
---
Well,  aside from cosmetic outfits which so far are almost all “not armor”, your choice is function vs style. Because getting a matching set of the armor you want, With actually useful legendary effects, is... a challenge. And stuff like the Enclave Scout armor doesn’t even have legendary variants
---
I remember how players praised the latest patchnotes here on reddit some days ago, before the patch went live and before trying it out for themselves.
---
I wished people would get real... this is Bethesda first multiplayer endeavour, it shows and it will be a long struggle to decent playability.
---
People might argue, that FO76 is no MMO. I could not care less about the terminology, cause it does not matter how its labeled. As a matter of fact the game has to cope with all issues, which happen to occur in online multiplayer games, the most challenging and complex type of videogames to develop. And that is the drag right now, and it will go on to be like this for longer periods of time.
---
Good thing I found the whore though stupid fucking chick. Ya cunt. I got an idea, you should shove the cardboard game right up your vagina.
---
I made the mistake of adopting a puppy 1 week before launch.

Duping requires crafting with leather and wood. But just leather doesn’t mean anything necessarily. Only scorchbeast hide scraps leather for endgame players that don’t bother looting anything but legendarys mostly. And leather armor sets are some of the easiest to source in terms of price and they need to be repaired somehow right? Each piece takes 11 or so. Once got accused of being a duper not even a few posts back on my profile for trying to buy 100 leather because not wanting to farm Brahmin hides means I cheat -_-
---
Indeed, not all strangers are bad. 
---
Maybe I should just be careful of the ones with the 3 or 4 figure bounties.
---
Do you think that my being faster or stronger has anything to do with my power armor, in this place?
---
Err... I think you may be reading it wrong. I've never had problems with it.
---
Do you know if they just block the character where the player just creates a new character or do they ban the license? I mean for some of these people they will just re-create and do the same thing.
---
My girlfriend and I play
---
Pretty awesome theory! Makes sense.
---
End game is about getting those damn power armor mods, getting 3 star legendaries, and farming flux for those end game crafts.
---
Else you're waiting for the next DLC content.
---
I see the pink paint in their database just like the flames. I’d have to go check but I think the recipe EID starts with Post....and that stuff has slowly ended up in Atomic Shop.       
---
I don’t think they’ve considered color tinted smoke as a cosmetic but now that I’ve mentioned it how cool right?!
---
And all while a horrible beeping noise repeats on a loop.
---
The fences in the defenses tab is the only option I've found.
---
Were you using the Stabilized perk? If you already had some armor reduction from that, and they stack multiplicatively, it probably wouldn't make a significant difference between guns. Try re-testing without any perks/effects that might affect armor pen.
---
Also, you can use the Awareness perk to see enemies' armor values in VATS. So maybe use that to find one with high armor values.
---
hopefully he be the next winner of the Darwin award instead :D
---
Reg2k is a trusted modder, for what its worth.  The DLL thing is a little scary from a fuzzy ToS point of view, but Beth has always been pretty support of these kinds of things, so I think safe.
---
I'm gonna put it in myself and cross my fingers. 
---
Was originally for the 14th
---
Are you doing this on a PS4 as well?
---
[PC] legendary enemies not dropping legendary loot, non legendary enemies dropping legendary loot. Seemed to happen rarely before patch, very common occurrence now. 
---
Silly quesiotn, but did you start up the anti-air missiles? I've never seen that many scorchbeasts come in either.. I wonder if they jumped up the difficulty? It is usually only 2 for me. 
---
Good thing you're reproducing. God we need less of you.
---
That's the interesting thing about the concept of tomboys: they're uniquely and ubiquitously feminine. They're a complex expression of it, but the concept itself is absolutely a part of femininity.
---
People are neat (and yeah, face-punching transcends sex and gender)
---
The first time I met one was scary as shit. I saw the name indicator when I walked by the truck, but thought it was past the truck, so I ran by looking for it. Eventually the name went away, but I was still in danger, so I turned around to head back to the highway and there it was. Scary shit
---
The console patch isnt out, how do you know the size? 
---
Its strange. About half the time for UF its pure mayhem, then the other half of the time is like you say, just boring.
---
We bought a second xbone solely for the purpose of playing together. I played starting with the beta, and we were taking turns playing solo after release, but eventually it just became too frustrating to not be able to interact in game so we took the plunge and have not regretted it at all. 
---
I had to start a new character because we'd been playing under the same Bethesda account, but since I tend to have more time to play, I was able to bust through the early stage quests rather quickly. It's been about 3 weeks since my restart and I've caught up to him in the main story (end of the Raider quests) and I'm nearly caught up in levels as well (44 to his 51). 
---
He really enjoyed being able to rescue me when I was lower level, bc he knew it was only a matter of time before I'd be a raging badass, lol. 
---
And of course I went to the Fancy Roach House and got a pair of wedding rings, which we both wear. :) He's the romantic one in our relationship, so he was surprised and pleased that I did something so sweet. 
---
Man just odd, I was in my camp for every bit 6 hours yesterday. Sorting inventory with my low level Mule nearby so if that didn’t scream duping I don’t know what would. 
---
you’re gonna insult a man for playing with his wife? i don’t know how that makes them fucking stupid. sounds like they manage their real life and still find time together. just makes u an asshole who probably plays alone 😬 
---
don’t worry about it stat, there’s always that one asshole who feels the need. 
---
It’s not bad, it has better stats than Excavator and has just as many if not more mods (no jet pack...), although I don’t think you can get PLANS for mods, so server hopping is about the only way to collect them. No paints though. 
---
Given how many people run around in Excavator 24/7, you won’t be worse off in Raider. It’s just not as good/easily moddable as top tier stuff like x-01/ultracite/T-51/T-60
---
You spelled "this game and the players from reddit are all pussies"
---
And what are the odds that as your MOB expends his last round of ammo while dying, he also breaks his gun? Yet I loot tons of corpses with no ammo and a broken gun.
---
They've said they're working on it, hopefully will be here in the next decent sized patch 
---
You’re playing a very different game than what people experienced in the beta or even over the first couple weeks. 
---
That said, I agree that the hate was overblown personally.
---
A rep replied to one of the crashing threads on the front page. It is a fix for the uptick in crashes and disconnects since Thursday's patch. 
---
If you’re on Xbox I have a mr fizzy hard hat if you’re interested 
---
A lot of people are just using it as an excuse to blow away low-levels and brush it off.  If you were high level they would not risk it.
---
now
---
Yeah man totally get that. 
---
Same with most software these days. Even my own 😂
---
Division actually bounced back. Its still super active even with Division 2 coming out in a few months. They did it right though. They actually fixed it instead of Bethesda's "FIX" with the limiting stacks players can craft or drop. 
---
When you have most of the player base using a glitch its kind of hard to ban everyone. FO76 still lacks in active players compared to other games recently released.
---
That being said i hope they really fixed the Dupe glitch, even though some on here are saying a new one is out. I'm ready for all this lag and disconnects to stop, Since most of you all are saying this is the cause of all that. 
---
Can't wait to see how this game is after like 6 months to a year.
---
&gt;Suddenly, since the patch a couple days ago (Jan 10 or 11), my bobby pins have stopped working properly, even on easy locks!
---
I thought the Jan 10 update was PC only.  Consoles get it tomorrow?
---
Sturdy and heavy leather armor plans show up for sale at various responder vendors. I'm not sure if there's a minimum level but I'm pretty sure I had most of them by level 35. Just visit several responder vendors a day and you'll find them.
---
Watoga Station has light combat armor plans but they're level-capped like the handmade rifle plans. Everything else is world drops and a few mission rewards, as far as I know. Light armor plans (or marine/trapper) are much more common drops than heavy armor.
---
Thank you. I was farming Philippi Battlefield Cemetery but it only has 1 guaranteed yao guais (on the parking). Time to change :) 
---
Since when did raider how the ability to use institute tech to teleport.
---
I will say that I wholly agree with the sentiment that additive changes (buffs) are *generally* better than reductive changes (nerfs).
---
However with TSEs in particular, my complain isn't only about how good they are relative to the rest of the weapon options.
---
My complaint is that the damage output of TSEs invalidates most, if not all, current game content.
---
If you want to buff damage output on weapons overall to be more comparable to TSEs (which by the way I totally agree energy and heavy weapons need serious attention) then I also think high level enemy health needs to be buffed (besides Behemoths. Fuck those sponges). I have no fun 1-2shotting everything in the game after the honeymoon phase wears off.
---
Also, if general weapon damage increases and survivability doesn't increase (for players), PvP will be even more pointless than it is now.
---
That's a helpful idea.  I do wear some gear with resists, and I'm munching Rad-x and various resist foods, so I usually make it back in, though sometimes I'm looting as a new group aggros onto me, and then it's often a corpse run.
---
Raider here. Sometimes i send team invites to everyone. Suckers take the bait. Suckers get CAMPS smashed...
---
Smashing a camp should yield resources. Wood and steel for destroying a players base equal to the cost to rebuild. Bounty outweighs the cost to rebuild right now. Not balanced. 
---
I feel that if I do all that stuff, it will make the next DLC content trivial. 
---
Farming camp plans and building new things could be fun. I wish there were quests for them or more info in game on where to get them. Am I supposed to just randomly claim workshops? I'm definitely not server hopping to find anything. Not fun.
---
This is totally off topic, but I am such a huge fan of your murder church and player oven. I even showed my wife your videos. 
---
Ok thanks.   The short fence works on upper floors I just realized but not around the stairwell.  
---
Love the response lol
---
If you ever see a butt ugly fat dude in a clown outfit or santa outfit, I'm a friendly!
---
(Also in game on Xbox)
---
Same issue here. Can't blueprint anymore!
---
Damn do you know how he got it ? 
---
(Looks at heavily tattooed face and angry expression of character) yes.... friendly face...
---
Bethesda doesn't know what they are doing. 
---
Not a fan of simple PvP but I’m thinking of taking on the role of bounty hunter. Any tips? 
---
Not understanding why do you have your panties in a knot? 
---
Yeah I figured. I’m not distressed about it. I’m happy, in love, and living my dream. 
---
Most of the reviews were actually pretty late. Especially by the bigger reviewing sites.
---
There were no early access copies given and most people gave an opinion on the Beta but not a review, until the full game was out. Most of the reviews trickled out maybe a week or so after the game.
---
Yeah man totally. 
---
But the NPC bit I disagree with. I paid a random bloke who showed up at my base to go gather wood for me. He did as well. Chucked him 40 caps! 
---
Oh ok.   Ill try that

"FALLOUT 76 PC HOTFIX NOTES – JANUARY 14, 2019

Fallout 76 on PC has received a new hotfix to address issues players were experiencing with server instability.
---
PATCH VERSION
---
PC: 1.0.4.13 (unchanged)
---
BUG FIXES
---
STABILITY AND PERFORMANCE
---
PC: Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability."
---
I don't, they just fucked my base up and payed for it, story time.
---
Feels a bit like a celebrity has commented on my post.
---
... and reported.
---
Seriously, I love pvp, in other games I played exclusively on pvp servers. I won't touch pvp in this game do to balance and the weird ass wanted / team / workshop / slap damage  / one shot shit show.
---
I will once i get on 
---
What I do as well OP, but last night I had 2 level 50's that would not leave me along, even with my stealth setup they came right to me and started spamming me with their freaking sonic blast.  Pissed me off so much i jumped into my power armor and shot them both out of the sky, checked their loot, what a waste of ammo and time.  Should have jumped too a different server.  I can kill level 50-95 with no problem, its just not worth my time anymore. 
---
Rone-ry, I am so rone-ry, I have no-body, to call my own. 
---
Your friend almost certainly Xp glitched while it was still available.
---
There is no greifing. Pvp and raider roleplay are not greifing. Its a mechanic
---
Yeah the wife and I play here. 33/29 ags respectively and we have a blast. She's more of a looks at EVERYTHING player. I'm a OMG I want to shoot something, LOOK OUT! 
---
Long range TSE gun is really the only tip you’ll need hah. Otherwise bounties aren’t the most common anymore since most people don’t like pvp 
---
Stop this shit man, youre scaring people out of cooperating
---
And There's always that little bitch trying to get laid by being a little bitch and letting the bitches take control. Thats you.
---
I get the feeling that this game was never intended to be an online game................. /s
---
1. Not all TSE should be nerfed, there're some combos that are doing 5x more damage than other TSE weapon combos. Makes no sense that a few weapons are ridiciliously OP. Not just best or OP. 5x more damage is more than OP. Balancing shotguns and whatnot, would make other weapons more attractive. Going to the direction of TSE Shotgun damage on more weapons would ruin the game, because there's no meaning one-shotting everything else than SBQ-kind-of-bosses. Adding new monsters that have 5x greater defensives or HP, because some weapons stand out so much in their weapon category would mean that you'd have to get those weapons to deal with these new mobs. A Mini Nuke's damage should be the greatest, not shooting with a shotgun from 72 ft away.
---
2. They really have to do something to add variety in best grind methods.
---
3. Mutation limit and adding new mutations would be great, but they are not really overpowered. More like: once you get used to them, it's hard to give up on them. Marsupial can be used without Class Freak, so almost every build can get it.
---
Tweet this to Bethesda you will probably get featured
---
Huge perk. When you toss on a luck bobblehead you seem to get extra meds on every roll.
---
Watoga High School:  lots and lots of plastic 
---
Not on at the moment but feel free to add me, srgt PEANUT.
---
I can help with whatever ya need. Entertainment and killing the queen are my specialties
---
Ugh, that's the worst, haha. I have to wear headphones whenever I do a quest that requires a sonic emitter, because it drives my dog fucking nuts. 
---
All these posts do is add more "hate" and criticism. Now people are going to tell you why the game was disliked and panned. These posts are useless.
---
A big patch was dropped &amp; even if it wasn't, I see no point in saying this about any game.
---
"I don't know why everyone hates this game" Maybe you're new here but these posts have been made since before the game release.
---
His friend played for around 3 months, recently came back to the game and assumed the 3rd perk was faster ads or another common duped gun perk. Turns out it was RW - said dude traded to friend for other items and said friend traded to me for Bloodied end game gear for his build! There may be others floating around on Xbox but none have really graced the market or been mass duped :)
---
It was in new vegas
---
Just got 3 disconnections and 2 blue screens in a hour . 
---
UK? 
---
Question: somehow I ended up w/ three power armor chassis. When I've tried to sell or scrap the others, I couldn't. I am pretty sure I couldn't drop them.
---
What console you on
---
Not sure about the red couch but I have the plan and can place one in your base if you are on Xbox
---
Put a door right in front of your stairs and a half-wall right behind it.
---
Put a slanted roof from wall to half wall.
---
Put funny slanty walls on sides.
---
Bam. Fancy stairs.
---
I remember your nickname that I found funny in one of yiur previous comments, you then found breaking the servers for others a reasonable thing to do. 
---
It's really not though. Abusing the friends list to go blow up someone's camp isnt a "mechanic".
---
I cant fucking wrap my head around the obtuseness of the apologists for this game.
---
Play the game for more than an hour man
---
I drop my extra stuff in sack at the stream. It's by the tree, right in the middle of some rocks where anybody can see it.
---
Where is the cooler at?  At the BOS vendor I drop everything into the bomb looking cans outside his store.  Most are just junk guns but its nice to have something to sale for the daily 200 caps.
---
I'd go with everyone trying to login at once when they come back online. that's a lot of servers spinning up at once! Give it a few hours and if it is still going on THEN I would be worried. 
---
I have noticed stability increases in where the old problems were, but more instability in the new problems created. They'll get it sorted. 
---
Honestly it’s been literal years since I’ve seen such toxic griefing in a game. Idk maybe I avoided the games in the past years before this one.
---
LMAO who hurt you dude
---
When I saw the first trailer I immediately knew this was going to be "Fallout side quests and building your house with friends".  
---
If that's what you like, much like I do, then you are probably going to find many hours of enjoyment, although a lot of frustration too from the technical issues.
---
If you wanted more, then you will hate this game with a fiery passion.  
---
It does not help that Bethesda has mangled the launch and screwed up every community interaction from day one, plus it really is an unfinished game.  With 16 year old bugs in it.  (Srsly, bugs that have been in their games using the core engine for 16 years....)
---
Me and a friend saw it at levels 9 and 10 briefly and it disappeared before we could even react.
---
Just use the cheat sites. The whole code finding and breaking routine seems like too much a PITA
---
No, US

Can we have a gatling laser gang? I just want to wreck with fireworks at 5 frames per second. We could watch each other's backs at the weapons work bench, since that's where we basically live.
---
Animals = non humanoid. So ghouls, scorched, supermutants, robots and I believe mole minors are not affected. I think everything else is though. 
---
Is it bad I actually want this to happen?
---
There's a really cool skeleton at the bottom of the Big Maw if you haven't seen it.

Getting killed seems to be patched to only clear your rads to a 75% max. I was trying to clear rads on a lowbie alt earlier and I never seemed to get above 75% of my bar full of rads. 
---
As a lowbie, best bet is finding a friend who can share Rad Sponge, and both of you hang in a low-radiation field for a bit. It triggers often enough you lose way more rads than you gain. 
---
I would love if I got 5 Scorched Beasts from that event, all that tasty Scorched meat.
---
The good thing is, you can always remove it. It sucked when there was no option but to use the useless dim version.
---
I am aware of the factions.  As I stated, I play encumbered, so going anywhere is like a Griswold vacation.  I pretty much stay around Whitespring grinding and trying to get legendaries that work with my build.
---
You would have to distinct between burnt singleplayers, which were lured into buying FO76 by misleading advertising and wrote dissappointed reviews subsequently, and us. We are different crowds.
---
The reviews, which you are refering to, are part of a review bombing in the beginning. They do not depict the common state of the game, which is a common problem for most games.
---
You did not mention the platform, which you are playing on. It is worse on console.
---
And besides performance and cheating issues, there are some detrimental gamedesign choices, which heavily affect later game stages (buff stacking, hp scaling, oneshot pvp and many more...)
---
Maybe just an outfit you think looks cool that goes over whatever armor   
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_armor\_and\_clothing](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_armor_and_clothing)
---
Keep an eye out at vendors or containers near vendors. You might find something useful. 
---
I remember buying a mid level Quad Lever and that helped me out a lot until I hit level 45, when I could start using a two shot pump that I had also bought off of a vendor.  One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. 
---
I have and that's what gave me the inspiration for the thing. I'd love to have some sort of raid version of that to kill
---
It's closer to 99.9% of them are duped. Personally I'd welcome a full inventory and cap wipe, just give out a good amount of atom shop points to everyone, have an ingame dismissible pop up stating why it was done, and add a bunch of the items they're sitting on at once to use them on. Of course, no point in doing so until duping is actually dead.
---
I just ate a bag of honey roasted peanuts... I’m sorry for your loss. I didn’t know.

I was thinking this yesterday. What if all the Scorched on the map dropped dead and didn't respawn for an hour after the Queen is killed? It would make sense for all the hivemind minions to just collapse when the central intelligence goes offline. 
---
Question: when you’re doing a pose in photo mode, do others around you see you in the pose or not?
---
Sometimes I find no loot at all on enemies I've just killed, including Legendaries, when this happens, I have learned to log off and back on, sometimes rejoining a Friend or Team which usually fixes the issue.
---
Sunday night I was teamed with another player hunting Legendaries in several locations, and on several occasions he was able to loot legendary Items from an enemy that I alone killed and found to be empty.
---
I killed Queen 2 days back.
---
Right before her 2nd mutation, she completely stopped taking damage for a solid 2 minutes while she was on the ground. We all just hid and let her take off. Once she did she healed back up and started taking damage again.
---
Seems like sometimes she bugs out. Pay attention to her health bar. If you don't see it moving at all, stop firing and try to reset her somehow.
---
(I've noticed if whoever she is targetting is standing on top of a building, she'll bug out and poison spray non-stop. If this person jumps on to the ground and moves a ways away, she will unbug.)
---
Ikr! I love building camps in this game, but it’ll definitely add a lot more creative freedom and fluidity to our camp building process if we’re able to edit the area afterwards, without having to demolish our progress. (Since blueprint in its current state don’t always work when you want to place them down again). 
---
Turn the sonic emitter off after the event starts. You don’t need it on the entire time, just gotta keep it repaired
---
I'm convinced these posts are shadow advertisements for duped items. I bet he's getting tons of PM's with offers to buy and selling to each person. 
---
Funny thing is the game isn't hard without all these TSE legendaries. My best one is a twoshot non explosive combat rifle and I use my hunting rifle more often.
---
Thanks - I’m on PS4 though. 
---
Need the “pip-boy colour” toggle to be added to the Options screen. 
---
&gt; you then found breaking the servers for others a reasonable thing to do.
---
Are you trolling? I report all bugs I find to bethesda and have done so since the pre-beta, and have never abused shit. Don't talk out your ass.
---
You've (wisely) waited to buy a game notorious for a rocky launch and lots of problems present for months after. Bethesda recently released a patch that fixed MANY of the bugs and issues players have been asking for fixes to.
---
But to add my personal take to the situation, I play on a (fairly beefy) PC. Many others are playing on PS4 and Xbox. What makes the situation even worse is that all of us, across various platforms, have experienced a wide spectrum of bugs, even across platforms (i.e. the game runs fine for some xbox players, but others crash to the dashboard). I had to stop playing the game for the past month because since the patch before the most recent one, the game would crash right to desktop upon loading into the world. That's only recently been fixed.
---
Unless they have altered the event beyond fixing the repair bug, once you've started the sonic emitter to set it all in motion you can switch the damn thing off and it still runs to a conclusion. 
---
I couldn’t hear them over the noises of the foodgasm I was having... they were so delicious that I couldn’t help it
---
PC was taken down for hotfix.
---
lol awesome use of the quote
---
Haha, well that thing must last for at least, what, two or three shots?
---
Also I love how weak energy weapons are in this game, even this legendary TSE gatling laser does 32 energy damage 
---
I fought him last night it would have been easy except he had a pet scorchbeast 
---
I’ve seen it multiple times just east of the Overseers camp 
---
New dupe methods involves dropping an item, crashing the server, server rolls back and dupes the dropped items
---
Nah the flux thing is the end game. DLC will be different they might even change the level cap for weapons.
---
Interesting. Where’d you find all this?
---
Aww, cheers man.  Back atcha.
---
Me too. Overseer's caches are great for getting plans in the hands of new players. 
---
Three easy payment and one fuckin’ complicated payment!
---
Yes, and what we are saying is as far as we can tell, most of that controversy all over the ‘net is manufactured for clickbait (thus ad money). IE, people have motives other than honest reviews. 
---
Mirelurks and yao guai are some of the alpha animal foes you'll run into.  Not sure if sloths, the grafton monster and deathclaws are considered animals.
---
You mean the 2 foundation framed stairs? Yeah, those are screwed. All I can suggest is putting a couch or a bench against the sides of the Darwin hole.
---
Do you lose caps in that event if you die? Or gain any if you kill someone?
---
Ah look, my post stepped in some raider slime.
---
You are correct, consoles haven't been patched yet
---
Dupers have them on Xbox, the ones I saw for sale higher base weight for whatever reason (like 8 or 9lbs).
---
How do you figure?
---
\#yourblogsucks
---
Not me, but for every 1 disconnect I get 4-5 blue screen crashes. I’d say it happens roughly once per hour. 
---
I scrolled way down and found it. Have hope lol
---
I showed off the murder church and oven to others as well.  Even to people who don't play the game.  They were that freaking cool.
---
How much I already got one but would love another
---
Really? Dang. Haven’t seen any myself to be honest and I troll that market76 sub all day. 
---
I encountered it up near the compass on the map itself, east of Abbie's bunker.
---
Anywhere. It's totally random. I've seen it in cranberry bog and Whitesprings.
---
Can you please share the nuka cola (and possibly other variants) recipes from the cookbook. I have ordered it but it doesn't seem to arrive.
---
Ugh, launch day some guy invited me to team up and he was having the most obnoxious (one sided at first) conversation, I though he was trolling me. Then I can hear a woman in the background. Regardless he is still being obnoxious so i dropped group.
---
Haven't had any issue until yesterday, I wasn't grouped but at Phoenix BoS vendor, and some guy was making up his own words to a known song about killing robots, probably still has *area* chat on. Left as soon as I could.
---
Yeah, it's a good call.  Speaking as a geezer, I have trouble swapping my perks cards back from crafting to combat.  Hazmat is a good idea, but I tend to keep resist gear on anyway and eat lots of Rad-x and resist foods.
---
Maybe consider making a proper sacrifice to RNGeesus.
---
Your first born might suffice.
---
My wife is both of those 😂
---
"**Systems**: Fixed an issue that allowed armor mods to reduce carry weight past intended values."
---
There's one. They fixed a mod.
---
Yeah, citation needed. 
---
&gt;go ahead and downvote if you’re a duper :)
---
This mentality on this sub is super annoying.
---
So Sally from the flatwoods holotape is the girl on the mothership FO3 DLC ? 
---
You must understand that duping does cause instability of the servers. I actively hunt down dupers and server not responding message on bottom right is a good indication that something fishy's going on in your session. Open up your map and if you see 2 or 3 people gathered up in some weird places like overseer's camp for no reason, that's yo duper right there. 
---
As a side note, I didn't say I never experienced disconnect or lag. What i said was I never got disconnected during BETA. After the release of the game, of course, I get disconnected like at least 5 times a day if I play long enough
---
Flair says raiders comment says Minutemen
---
The scorchbeasts are misunderstood. They were just trying to stop the damned bleeping.
---
You ever blow Bubbles as a kid?
---
You’re super annoying - and took the bait. *Duper revealed* 🎣 
---
It works, the stuff that is instanced is still instanced but anything else you add will stay just like any other container and show up for everyone. 
---
I wasn't paying enough attention honestly to say for sure. 
---
Yes, planning ahead is the way to go if you don’t want to encounter this issue at all. However, sometimes new ideas pop up which you might like more in the midst of building, and it’d be nice to be able to edit the area to include those new ideas. It just gives more freedom =)
---
Caught the tater!
---
Dammnit they sold us Skyrim again
---
Thank you for your input, raider. I kinda like that idea, honestly - being able to harvest some kind of measly scrap from what you’ve blown to smithereens? And likewise, if the raider is killed or doesn't get to pick it up, the owner could salvage the bits and pieces to reduce the rebuild cost?
---
Yeah, but he blew me back.
---
Just lower your pants and shake your ass. 
---
Or someone who dupes
---
Forgot your /s
---
Was ur base near abandon bog town?
---
Check rules 1 &amp; 9
---
Indeed.
---
Multiple Beth people said that PVP was completely optional. So either they lied, or it's not a functional mechanic based on advertised features/gameplay.
---
It's no sweat to me, any dumb-ass that tries just gets one shot with a TSE and I get free caps; shit gameplay "mechanics" are still shit.
---
It lasts like 1 and a half cores. I don't even understand how you make laser beams explosive. Thinking about putting a prime receiver on it and saving for SBQ now that I'm down to 3 regular cores 
---
He's probably a closet homo and is trying to act all badass to cover it lol
---
And why are you giving the obvious troll attention?
---
maybe bethesda will do it butt they probably willn’t
---
killed it the other day
---
Thank you very much for the usefull advice.
---
But doesnt Pacifist make you do slap damage? Enemies can hit you with full strenght.
---
Donuts of Doom.  That is freaking great.
---
Delete post, report to mods.
---
Thanks
---
i think i tested the electrically charged mutation and it did half the hp bar of a lvl1 radroach, which is next to nothing, also it seemed to lag my game when triggered so i got rid of it
---
How is this relevant or helpful?
---
Not trying to shit on console players but I feel like problem is only rampant on xbox and ps4....  I read constant posts and never experienced anything like this on pc. It can probably be attributed to younger kids. I would agree though, I dont add anyone I didnt meet in game,  I do get random invites from people I never crossed paths with that I just ignore...probably good practice for everyone.
---
I record my sleep in my bullet journal. I have noticed that since the game has come out I won't start to give to sleep until 4am, sometimes going until 7 am before I go to bed. 
---
[Don’t do chems, kids...](https://imgur.com/gallery/35X7zVF)

i always dump my excess loot from a white springs nuke in the crafting corner register. i try to dump my excess plans in the overseer's box at the overseer camp. after a nuke on the queen i drop my extra loot in the register at watoga station. i always try to use the register at a vendor so finding it is easier
---
That looks like it would be a cool place to build a camp. Ima check it out. Thank you.
---
They see you in the pose. Makes for some entertaining set-ups for group shots.
---
Nah I just sat it down near a place I was exploring in the Savage divide
---
Just someone who needs attention... 
---
No, and i did.  Maybe report this post to the mods, so they can take it all down.
---
Well, just now I fast traveled to Abbie's Bunker and there was one right there.
---
Just report, Dont make threads
---
&gt; Reasoning that it affects nothing is cause maybe SBQ isn't a unique creature?
---
I can confirm there are at least 3 Scorchbeast Queens, having observed three bodies and three nuked zones.
---
Stack saves don’t need to be real time if they are naturally being used like in weapon firing or stim use. Dropping items however do need to be real time updated it’s common for games with similar features to try it. 
---
Not Even Once. 
---
Thanks for the good advice. Gonna look out for players now. 
---
Thanks for sharing this. Now that I think about it, there really isn't any good reason to accept a party invite from strangers with bounties. As a player without a bounty, you're anonymous. Your camp can't be found on the map. The minute you party up, you're exposed.
---
I am letting other women know rhey are not alone being harassed in PMs by this troll.
---
What level were you and what kind of build? 
---
Bat Boy wants to challenge Night Kid to a Death Match :)
---
Just follow the roads and walk a lot. I ran into Mothman almost as soon as I left the vault on the road to Flatwoods. He had the purple eyes and didn't attack me. After 10-15 seconds, he just flew off. He zipped in very fast and out the same way.  There's a Red Rocket in the NE area of the map somewhat near a crevice up there. I was just wandering the area and someone nuked the crevice. I took some heavy rads but survived. I proceeded to the RR to heal up and fix my gear. About 200 yards from the RR, a Oversized pink Behemoth spawned right there in the middle of the road. He was about 1/2 the size again bigger than a normal one, but the kicker is that he was pink! Blew my fucking my. I put my bowl down and said that's enough of that shit. LMAO That's the only 2 cryptids that I've seen
---
I was like you at first. I didn't see where all the hate came from. It was pretty fun to play with a friend just scavenging the wastes and whatnot. The world is really beautiful and the lack of real NPCs didn't bother me at first. 
---
But after playing through the main story, I can't help but feel like the game just didn't have enough quality content to be a $60 game. I left the main story thinking "that's it?" 
---
I still enjoyed some of my time with the game, but I also think it wasted its potential.
---
Unbelievable. What a horrible waste of space. Sorry this happened to you! 
---
Post a price!
---
Eh i tried my best to convey the thought. 
---
My camp cost a lot of resources to rebuild when someone randomly leveled it. Was not fun.
---
She’s 91 and I’m 87
---
I've started dumping in the register.
---
I don’t roleplay but once a day I fast travel to a low level dude on my server, look at his weapon and drop whatever ammo I have for it. 
---
The hardest part I’ve found is shooting flares, emoting, doing circles around the bag, turning my pip boy light on and off, and repeatedly talking on voice chat to let them know that I dropped it for them.
---
I had a guy yesterday I followed around for 10 solid minutes to give him 300 shotgun rounds. I had to pick up and drop five times before he understood 
---
# WHAT WAS THAT? YOU'LL HAVE TO SPEAK UP LAD! MY HEARING'S NOT SO GOOD
---
No one is good at everything the first time, I was borderline retarded when I moved from console to PC.
---
He may have bought it. There was a player next to me (not lagging), but I was about to buy an X-01 mod from the enclave vendor. Did the same, popped Hard Bargain and menstats and it was gone. 
---
I tend to accept random friend requests since its usually people just wanting to fast travel or log back into the same server they were just on
---
Yeah my bad. 
---
I launched through the Bethesda launcher, but it kept asking for my password again. 
---
Great comments everyone! Sounds like there are a lot of people already doing this. We can all agree the paper bag system is bad, and we just need to standardize where we drop. 
---
I think the blue suitcases at the train station (green if no blue around) and the ice chest at the whitesprings are great ideas. 
---
Dropping in containers will make this game great again! 
---
I have been perpetually saddened by how relatively useless mini-nukes are. They're mini-***nukes***.    
---
I don't have a fix for shotguns that wouldn't be nerfing or scaling everything up. Their problem seems to be an issue of each pellet counting as a shot. You don't even need the "two shot" affix for shotguns since that only gives you an extra pellet. There should only be one explosion or the damage of one explosion should be split by however many pellets. Shotguns might be a special case just because of how they work.
---
It collapses the superposition of their inventory. 
---
Im still waiting for the day that Bethesda puts out something nicer than what the modders do.
---
How is it that not one texture designer at Bethesda can make a better paint job than some 17yr old modder with photoshop?
---
i was wondering the same thing
---
Yeah I'm a level 38 and got repeatedly harrassed by a group of 4 120+ griefers with TSEs and a base right next to mine to trap unwitting players. Took long enough to find the mats needed to repair my base and they ended up blocked after I figured out how to do that, but it would sure be nice if there were some kind of balanced retaliation a low-level could take against high-level griefers.
---
Because the patch notes list the size
---
But it brings up a fair point
---
There should be armor options for explosive damage at the very least
---
Yeah, that was good. Thank you for that gratifying answer to what it all looked like. 
---
You got saaaaaccckkked
---
I've heard mixed opinions on it.
---
That is a lot of words and a lot of thinking that somehow failed to understand what “power creep” means.
---
But let’s step back from invective and examine quickly here. Buffing to match style balancing only works if none of the currently overpowered things are strong enough to invalidate certain game functions. In other words, put the overpowered on a scale. Well here, TSE’s allow one shots. In any game, easy peesy one shots are unacceptable. Sniper bullet to the head with minimal aim assist? That’s fair. But we aren’t in a FPS only. It’s also an RPG, so even allowing that might be a tad much. But TSE shotguns don’t even require aiming much to get a kill.
---
So how can you justify creating more things of equal power to TSE? In other words, you just told me you want more things in the game that allow casual PvP one shots. Justify that.
---
One thing I’ll not allow: PvE weapon performance. The answer there is across the board enemy rebalancing. Because the issue is bullet sponge enemies. Balance the problem, don’t create new ones.
---
Please elaborate on your edit? Bold assumption to make. You’re wrong FYI.
---
I am confused by this post. Your icon is always on the map . If someone wants your camp location all they have to do is sit and watch you until you teleport to your camp. 
---
I agree but  if there werent dupers there wouldnt be hundreds or thousands of these legendary godroll weapons.
---
If there werent ways to dupe weapons, tse pump shottys, lever actions and handmades would be way more rare and would sell for upwards of 10-15k
---
At the southernmost edge of Whitesprings, there's a small cave that a Yao Gaui spawns in. My house is set up at the small pond just north of there.
---
I get water, springs, acid (from the bear), meat (from the mirelurks), and healing salves (bloodleaf spawns in the pond, sootflower just to the east). From time to time, even Nuka Cola (in the nuka cola vending machine just beside my CAMP) or a quantum. 
---
So here is the comparison for you, 4 blasts without Power User then 4 with. Holding the button so you can see better how much is used, I don't recommend you do this for actual flight
---
[https://youtu.be/Ey67NzqylKc](https://youtu.be/Ey67NzqylKc)
---
As you can see only 4 blasts uses nearly a quarter of a Fusion Core, so the folks who say they carry 5 and that "they use it all the time" without Power User are....well you know...
---
My husband and I play together. He's a level 101 and I'm 98. We've been playing together since the launch and we honestly love it. It's helped us bond a lot due to the fact that we never play simar games. We've even got our own separate setups in the house. This game is legit the best and I love how it brings people together. 🖤
---
That's not how pacifist works, pacifist makes it so when you shoot someone else it doesn't do damage, preventing the exchange of slap damage that normally opens full damage PVP.  If you have pacifist turned on when someone starts to capture a workshop from you it initiates full PVP anyways except you still have it turned on and your attacks deal zero damage to the opponent while he hits you full speed ahead like a truck.  Slap damage is the normal system for those without pacifist on, I slap you, you slap me, pvp engaged.
---
Just play the game
---
You get more steel from the super mutants than the extractors at the steel yard.
---
\&gt; circlejerk by hipster gamers
---
\&gt; 50% on metacritic
---
Yeah, the game totally deserves like 90% score, it's nearly perfect. Not a single true word in those reviews has been written. 
---
How else are these hard bois going to win?
---
Keep Farming Legendaries, once you get an Explosive Shotgun, SBs are an easy kill, that sometimes drop good plans.
---
If you get the VATs perk that allows you to target body parts, a few shots to the wing will make them land, also if you can take cover around trees, train cars, containers, bridges &amp; such, they will land quickly to try and reach you.
---
I may do the same. It is a buildable spot after all.
---
Yup, happened to me last night. It even showed up as a side quest while I was bashing glowing ones at The Whitespring. So, of course. I was encumbered, I opened the drop crate and was attacked by a glowing radscorpion. A level 215 one shots me, waits for me to respawn and as I approach, he squats over my loot. I got on mic and explained what happened, he said I should get rid of my junk before I go “looting”. I don’t loot, so I don’t have a standard procedure for that situation. Needless to say, he took all my shit. 
---
Luckily, I was within earshot of another higher level player who one shorted the 215 and I got some of my junk back.
---
Basically, getting a wanted tag for opening a crate (that I was directed to by a side quest) is bullshit.
---
What kind of flowers?
---
That isn't a fix for the other dupe method :(
---
I walk everywhere so I get to see alot of the countryside and it's creatures. I can't fast travel because I'm perminantly over-encumbered lol. Can't shake the habit of picking up every thing so takes ages to walk from one end to the other 
---
Ill be on.  Utchia23.  Level 57 but haven't done much of the story.
---
Happened to me before too, hazards of having a camp in a popular nuke area.
---
Nice story, I guess they could of had a 2nd device watching the map as well, probably the afk character, I play with 2 consoles myself and regular use 1 of them to watch my other camp and areas. Too bad there are such douche bags like this, but thanks for the heads up.
---
There's.... a giant red circle on the map where a nuke is....
---
Everybody was pitching in but yea a lot of guys were on the ground trying to kill the spawns that were harassing them. 
---
I've been doing this from Day 1. Bullets and plans. Some legendary armors and guns too.
---
*mind blown* holy crap, there is EVERYTHING in there!
---
Each enemy has a PER rating, and enemies with lower PER (like mole miners) will lose you faster. Also, line of sight matters -- hiding under a grove of trees works better for a scorch beast flying overhead, whereas popping around a corner is effective against ground troops. 
---
Wendigoes and scorchbeasts seem to have higher PER and are harder to evade. But I have legit crouched five feet in front of a mirelurk that was charging me, turned invisible with my chameleon armor, and watched it stop, turn around in confusion, and then run the other way. 
---
I’ve left my reply. Don’t really give a shit if you believe me or not, I’m telling the truth so believe who you want. Makes no difference to me :)
---
has it been fixed with the update ?
---
Had it happen to me before, by fault for logging out at white springs xD
---
wow it should be buffed 
---
I have a love/hate relationship with this game. 
---
It feels a lot like the other Fallouts (especially 4, for better or worse) and there's a lot of fun to be had exploring and hunting down the weird new creatures. 
---
But every time I start to get in the groove the game does something to annoy me. I get disconnected 3 times in 2 hours. I get spawned in under an angry scorchbeast. Or the most recent. Half my armor is broken or close to it. I have no ballistic fiber to fix it. I haven't found a reliable source of it. 
---
And my current quest wants me to "befriend" a deathclaw. I can't imagine it going well.
---
Wow I'm on xbox and never had a bad experience like that, I guess I've been really lucky, thanks for the warning 
---
I should do that -- I do have those perks but I'm not in a team so I wonder if it applies if you're in a event with others, not in a team? 
---
If only you were on the dev team
---
All of them, I will scour the entire land for each type of flower and hand deliver them to you myself on my knees
---
My game crashed when I was inside the bunker at white springs. So it spawns me outside when I returned back to the game. New lobby with a active nuke. Dead. Looted. Pissed.
---
No, open pvp almost no consequences
---
Which you can't see until after you fully load in and get to move. He's not talking about fast traveling, he's talking about when you first join a server.
---
Sure, we'd laugh for a minute, then go, "No, seriously Todd, what the FUCK did you guys do?"
---
I should use the syringer. I did think about it but usually forget. 
---
What's pointless? 
---
Well...a boss caliber one lol.... Bigger maybe? 
---
Thank you for sharing this seems very useful. Might you post your source?
---
I fully expect Bethesda to add more end game content in the future.  I'm only in my mid-60s levels and I'm already starting to feel the endgame depression.  I still enjoy the game though.  
---
Ah 
---
Maybe. There were a few guys with explosives and everybody was a decent enough level. 
---
Thats one of the random spawn locations 
---
You do realize I am talking about just joining a lobby where there’s already a nuke at your spawn point. 
---
I agree, we don't need more one-shotting in this game we need no one-shotting.
---

The server stops existing after a few hours lol 
---
Didn't you get your complimentary Mr. Handy?
---
Yeah they need to implement that in a way that is similar to how camps work now
---
Mate, the majority of people on the internet where you are getting your metacritic scores will get a silly issue and BAM, 1 out of 10. 
---
Really? A 1? Really? Think about that, you know I ain’t wrong man. 
---
50% score is wrong. I’m experienced enough a gamer to know that in the first 20 minutes. As are you dude! 
---
Thanks for the help people.
---
I know mirelurks were under exterminator with bugs. I just shoot stuff with it anyway because it's boss but I never thought I'd need 30% extra damage to a level 1 squirrel.
---
[Whispering] *Tiramisu...*
---
I blame them for the anti-duper hysteria where people are now "hunting" regular players as dupers. 
---
And once you’re high level with good gear everything dies in seconds and you stand around for a couple minutes waiting on another wave to spawn. 
---
I thought slap damage is the reduced damage with pacifist. I get what you mean its a disavante everytime you claim a workshop. That doesnt effect me elsewhere then. 
---
20 with a black powered pistol and a friend that was lvl 36
---
Was juat about to ask this too. I was wondering if I was wasting slots and if I should've been getting Demo Expert instead. Turns out I'm not wasting slots and I should also try to get demo expert for max damage potential
---
I was in your boat, until I found a good gatling gun and equipped the Martial Artist perk for the increased "swing speed" (30%).  It's like having the per-shot damage of a hunting rifle with 500 shots before reloading (which is surprisingly fast anyway).  Anti-armor gatling is spectacular if you can find one.  TSE is best with a 50 cal.  My build is primarily heavy weapons but you can slot melee, shotgun, and rifle perks as well.  I basically run heavy weapons for everything but Whitespring Nuke farming, where I'll slot Enforcer (shotgun) and Incisor (2h melee).

Tbh a decent chunk of players are dupers so......
---
&gt;And no, dupers ain’t getting it - go ahead and downvote if you’re a duper :)
---
I dont know why you'd think a duper doesn't already have 40 of these
---
well it can be tested easily but requires a friend, just aim at the ground and shoot and the friend moves slowly closer till just in range of it with the card equipped then remove the card and if he still is hit by the aoe then it doesn't do anything. make sure to mark where you are shooting for accurate results.
---
I agree, and I think the explosive effect itself needs some careful changes. As you say, too much and some TSE weapons get screwed. 
---
It blows me away that every TSE defender comes storming in with pie in the sky ideas that are always 10 times more complicated than “just rebalance the explosive effect.” Not even two shot is really bad because it comes prebalanced with big increases to recoil and accuracy penalties.

---
Maybe.. There were a few of us on the building where the elevator from the glassed caverns comes up out to. That might have caused something to like that to happen.. Too bad I can't speak well enough over voice to explain that if it happens again (deaf). That's why there needs to be text chat, damn it. 
---
Thanks, glitchers.
---
What are you an idiot? That’s what it’s for you moron 
---
LOVE THIS. I like the photo feature as-is, but more share-ability would be great...imagine walking into someone's CAMP and seeing their selfie with Wise Moth Man lmao
---
There’s usually one or two giant sloths that spawn near a shack at the bottom of Tanagra town 
---
I made a shop-lookalike outside Whitesprings. I entice them in with offers of trade, then lock the door and set the flamethrowers off from inside. 
---
Also a suggestion that I haven't seen listed here...
---
If you overlap two letters, then one will snap perfectly to the right of it.
---
For example, place the "S".  Then place an "X" right on top of it.  The "P" should snap to the "S" just fine.  Then move the "X" to overlap the "P".  Place the "A".  So on and so forth...
---
This is how I was able to overlap all of the letters on the wall of my camp when I experienced the same issue that you described.
---
After the PC patch I played a couple sessions, around 4 hours straight each. I had no disconnects at all which was great. On Xbox however I tried playing last night and got disconnected twice and then a crash, all within 15 min and the new patch isn’t even up yet. I’m not sure what the problem was but I’m worried it’ll get worse on Xbox if this new patch hits and a worse duping method works there. 
---
Do quests and events with the xp that you get from the enemies + the activity youre doing youll be level 50 in no time
---
Prepare for downvotes. Every time I post or comment about this I get an avalanche of downvotes and people trying to programmer-splain to me why it's not shoddy work by bethesda it's actually (insert something here that makes it sound like it's ok). 
---
99.93% of people have a mic according to steam.

---
I'm like half your level and finished this questline, lol. It's not so much your level as what you've focused on. I'm sure you've done far more with other quests than I have instead.
---
*record scratch* 
---
Right about know you're probably wondering how I got into this mess...
---
^ this
---
Things get weird at the tail end of a nuke, the radiation clears but the spawns can wig out a bit.
---
1) Guilty as charged, I do love drama.
---
2) Well, you're right, with bounties that high I could've reasonably assumed they were griefers. Honestly though, maybe I'm naive, but I was thinking they got it from just blowing their way into a fortified munitions factory.
---
3) But, they didn't - I saw two destroyed camps, neither of which were mine. They didn’t find my place, fortunately.
---
Yes, super mutants will pick up miniguns and get +500 5mm 
---
I accidentally joined an expedition to help some people go through Sugar Grove. I was level 30 or so. 
---
I walked in to the White springs train station. Several people were talking on area chat while I sold stuff and dropped things in my box.   
---
One commented that he had an extra lever rifle I could use. I like the lever, and mine was getting a bit outlevelled. I thanked him for the rifle, and gave another guy a legendary chinese sword I had gotten in the recent nuke because he preferred melee.  
---
Then they all said time to go, lets meet at sugar grove- you too!
---
Uh. OK. never been though so give me a minute to walk over. We ran through, cleaned the place out, let the guys that needed quest things get theirs done. They asked why I was not doing it and I said "Never been here, don't have any quests for here." they were confused why I came along then.  
---
"You invited me, and I tend to just wander around randomly anyway. Sounded like fun. And it was."  
---
Solid offer lol. This made me laugh 
---
Yeah this definitely sounds like a controller issue.
---
And all the parts to make Scorch Best mix meat stew!
---
This happened last night while I was building a new camp on PC. A 250+ level super decked-out player with a TSE shotgun (with a 500 cap bounty already) and his 160ish non-flagged buddy rolled in twice. The 250 shot everything up while his buddy was scoping out the next camp next camp I am sure.. overall seriously cheesy. 
---
I rad-puke emoted on them a couple times and repaired everything in a single click when they left. Not really sure what they get out of it.. but griefers come in all forms. I find it amusing that they are sinpmy bypassing the PvP mechanics by using a non-flagged “scout”. Shows they spent time thinking about it.. which makes it all the more lame.
---
Mmmmm
---
i didnt and i wont i want to play the game honestly
---
I would love to help out in any way possible. I think a discord would be great!
---
Thanks for speaking up!
---
You think so? I don't know. I assume most of them can't be bothered to smash out 300 boards or whatever so they just buy stuff from the market.
---
Might have been me. Sorry to hear about the 50 wood and 50 steel. Must have taken you 6 or 7 minutes to farm that. What greif!
---
I didnt see that in the patch notes is that where you got that?
---
And never spoils. Dog Food is one of those amazing food items if you have the right perks for it.
---
there is a secret one in the entrance to the enclave bunker, cant seem to lift it up though lmao
---
Damn, good to know. And performance differences? A lot or not really?
---
Download and install the Bethesda launcher, they appear in the games list on the left side as “Not Installed” I think.
---
Thats awesome!  I know what im doin later!
---
I do appreciate that I can role play my real-life coffee addiction in the game.
---
Acting like its never going to spawn again lol.
---
I'd be *more* inclined to wear it if I was running a male sprite, lol
---
But it's a pretty ugly dress, imo. :/ I put it on for a few seconds and quickly removed it when I saw what it looked like.
---
I like the scarf, though.
---
At least on console their are a lot and tbh the 300 boards isn’t that hard to collect.
---
I went till lvl 120 or so till I found one. Now I seem to find them on a daily basis!
---
This is *Bethesda* we're talking about here. I'm pretty sure them releasing a game that's stable on day 1 is a sign of the apocalypse.
---
Yes.
---
So far I've found that you can get the following food items from searching food containers:
---
* Canned Dog Food (Good Doggy makes this amazing early on)
---
* Canned Coffee
---
* Purified Water 
---
* Cram
---
* Potato Crisps
---
* Vegetarian Ham
---
* Cajun Rice &amp; Beans
---
* Imitation Seafood
---
And remember these food items **DO NOT SPOIL.**
---
Only got one but I'll check it out. Thanks. 
---
Hopefully it's Boss canned coffee.
---
though i call "us" raiders we only raid those who make game play impossible like dupers people who build bases with turrets at white springs etc. 
---
Honestly that probably did happen,  fuck this game is so annoying sometimes!! 
---
Never heard of a forest camo jumpsuit. Wonder what it looks like
---
Acting like you’re thinking the odds are in your favour when it’s like million to one. Only chance you’re getting one is from a duper - good luck.
---
Well said, imo honesty is hard to come by these days, even tho this is a video game we should aspire to it. One is plainly fooling itself if he thinks the weapon is not duped. Heck i have my doubts about some of the stuff ive seen in vendor bots. 
---
Yes. Legitimize camp raiding.
---
I couldn't agree more. This happened twice yesterday. I'm not someone who willfully destroys other people's bases or workshops, but I did this time. We launched the nuke at Whitesprings to get some XP and farm gear, then this stupid base pops and all the mobs go to the back. I stored my junk, turned off pacifist, and started wailing. First on the turrets, then the other parts of the base (to send a message). Dude finally returns to the base, so I hit him too, at this point not caring at all about the bounty. He finally strikes back (total mistake), so I took him out. Finally, exited my team so my buddy could kill me and get the caps. Total waste of time for me, but the only thing that could be done to these jerks. #karma
---
Yea. Usually when I'm up at the SQ, she does land pretty frequently so that's not quite the problem, just killing her lately. I'll bring a syringer the next time. 
---
I was able to get that, it looks like all the other jumpsuits, just with a Camo design
---
Does carnivore work with cannibal? 
---
Your English is great, much better than many that are native to it.
---
Thanks for the share.
---
Because they don’t on Xbox 1? Lol.
---
so long as the servers stay up
---
Ill check it out, ive been iffy on running martial artist for the gatling because i figured it was a bug to be patched
---
I actually had this happen last night. I sniped a group of 4 level 40ish super mutants from a distance. When I went to loot, one of them had a metric shit ton of ammo. 500 5mm, some .45 and .308. That was the closest corpse, so I KNOW he was the one that charged me to melee  
---
Yeah she came off as a spoiled little brat. Which, I guess being the child of a famous actress may very well set one up to be that way to an extent.
---
There is an obstacle course (I think it’s under a chicken on the map) which is not the military one. You will want to burn your hair off with a lighter by the time you finally finish.
---
Eastern Standard Time. As opposed to EDT which is Eastern Daylight Time. Which should be the norm and they should eliminate standard time altogether.
---
But, I digress.
---
yes, those are recrafted with better dmg
---
I thought you had to craft them all individually from leather and wood, drop 250, pick up 50, and then somehow transfer/trade something for the most used method? I have no idea, but the most widely published dupe method is really awkward.
---
I'd imagine 
---
Wood is super useful, if like me, you cook all the things.  I heal more from Healing Salves than stims tbh, and fuggin all cooking recipees use one wood, I've 'burned' at least 1k wood by this point, just by cooking
---
Yes, my phone is awful,I did mean switchblade.
---
Now you have me thinking of a switchboard now and how cute one would be
---
Yeah, sorry, it is too good for the quality standard the game has set. Perhaps it can be made, idk, stupider? How about fruit, is there anyway we could add fruit to it?
---
&gt;comes prebalanced with big increases to recoil and accuracy
---
That's exactly why TSE is such a strong outlier in effective damage output.
---
The explosive perk completely overwrites the accuracy and recoil problems when shooting at anything on the ground.
---
Be strong.....don’t cheat to get the codes!
---
Oops :)
---
No greif. You greif yourself by being in denial of the game mechanics. Smashing camps is a feature. Ive got perk cards to prove it.
---
Funny how prime doesn't add a star though. It's the scorched killers receiver except it doesn't do any reduced damage, and gets the bonus damage of a hardened receiver. 
---
You do realize it takes more than that to repair a camp right? 
---
It’s confusing at first but it’s really simple tbh.. plus instead of dropping the boards if u drop them and have a buddy trade u them when u get kicked for the board overload u keep the 300 boards too... so no need to make more just keep duping
---
Yeah. I'll probably come back to it in a year or so and make a new character.
---
Some folks just want to see the world burn.
---
I would love something like this. Also let me trade through the app that way while I'm doing other things. I want can manage my stash and trade with other players so that when I log in in I dont have to spend an hour facilitating a trade for screws or whatever so I can go do quest.
---
Same. I’ve only been messed with once on Xbox so far and then everyone I’ve run into on PC had been friendly and helpful or just neutral. I understand there’s griefers out there but I guess I’ve either just been real lucky or people might be over exaggerating when they say they can’t do anything without getting killed... or just have terrible luck. 
---
ok, that would be a sensible response to a different post asking, "What are your specs and what fps do you get?" but that's not what OP asked
---
correct (Program files(x86).
---
In a trunk, or in a fridge?
---
There is one in the kitchen of the volunteer building in Flatwoods. Three fridges in the back kitchen, the one on the right has the corpse and his holotape
---
It was in an earlier patch in Dec iirc
---
It really does! And that’s awesome. Me and my wife have our own setups, she always tries to outdo mine 😅
---
Nice, I didn’t remember that part about the water barons, that must have been fo2, right? Since in one they were using coin or something. 
---
All in all I don’t try and sweat to many of the details. The  lore is decades old and the property has changed hands several times since the original fallout, but the overall atmosphere and depth of the games has been consistent and  improved on.
---
I will try to join you shortly 
---
What we see here isn't just stupid, folks. This is *advanced* stupid.
---
You are A plus trolling man. I'll upvote this one. Lol
---
You just inspect it. It's bound to X on my keyboard by default. It's same as inspecting it as in your inventory. You can purchase depending on if you liked it or not.
---
Yeah, can't be the patch yet.  Xbox doesn't get the patch till tomorrow.
---
This movie never got the recognition it deserved.
---
Mine scared the shit outta me. I was leaving my camp at night and walking into the woods and heard a huge blast and crazy space sounds. 
---
Consider yourself lucky.
---
Think you could post a picture of it? I like the forest camo stuff 
---
And the negative of ultracite ammo. The entire reason I don't use prime is the ammo is a pain.
---
whats your psn
---
Are you from the future?
---
While I dont agree with the overall tone of your comments I gotta say, 
---
It *was* advertised as you can blow up other players CAMPS with a Nuke and completely decimate it. Meaning you have a right to destroy other players CAMPS in game, meaning it is an intentional mechanic. 
---
 Now is it douchey to abuse the team function to hunt CAMPS?     Absolutely, but destroying the CAMP is not the real issue here sadly. Its these douche players exploiting the Team function to do it. For whatever reason besides trolling.  
---
I think this issue is very similar to how Sea of Thieves handles PvP. 
---
Is it optional?  Yes. But this applies to everyone. 
---
Just because you are choosing not to attack other ships/people, doesn't mean they are choosing the same thing.
---
Is it douchey to constantly hunt solo sloop players and sink them over and over? Yes.  But its part of the game.  
---
 You're best option to avoid douchebag trolls and not PvP as a whole?  Leave the server. Hardly a bitch move.
---
Weird. Demolishion Expert definitely stiff effects my explosive shotgun.
---
Comment is there somewhere, but sure👍🏼
---
Thanks for the invite, we try to make it in about 20-30mins 
---
Being a stealth player, this is music to my ears. I finished the quest, but haven't been using the items. The dress is ugly so I took it off, lol.
---
But I'll have to take a closer look at the items and their effects. I tend to shoot from a distance, but if I can slink right up to something in broad daylight and cut its throat that'd be pretty awesome
---
Yes, but it will cost more to claim. 
---
I haven't done it in awhile as its a chore but 5 caught me offguard.
---
With less frustration i just did belly of the beast and the heart of the enemy quests.
---
Wonky event triggered me
---
Do you know which event and what level you were? Wish you were on PC! I need that jacket.
---
Depending on console you could get one, only console that doesn’t have mass dupes of these is XB1.
---
Well...shit, that sucks! I hope they give us the option to strip legendary modifiers and apply them to other weapons/armor at some point.
---
I've had to trade for it a few times after spamming a few hundred boiled water for us in making boatloads of foods
---
Unnngh yes. 
---
That with green flashes layered over it
---
+karma lol am I doing this right?
---
Who tf pays for an ark server my bro literally runs it on a ps4
---
Hi. What a combo lol.
---
I agree, but if this story is true, it’s a much more streamlined process with instant gratification. 
---
Try a gatling gun. Probably the most economical late game weapon. Helps to scrap enough to get the quick mod, and also use the martial artist perk, which affects its fire rate for some reason. Overall, it has a low fire rate with high damage, so you don't have to repair it often and you can produce the ammo cheaply 180 at a time, since it uses the same ammo as the much faster minigun.
---
This game sure sounds fun to play.
---
Maybe if the had 1x10^-6 the power of a full nuke, the name would stick?
---
The hells this "shower" you speak of?
---
Make sure you keep the Well Rested buff going
---
 It would barely matter, there is little variation in stats in this game, at level 60 you get the best weapons you will ever get then just kinda have to luck into maybe getting something broken. It's not something you work towards or anything. 
---
Seems like it would be better with some changes. Like fast travel only working train station to train station, a cooldown after switching pvp state, more rewards for the raiders, but maybe death has penalties and sends you back to your camp?
---
Interesting, will try all of the 3 solutions, will post back how it went, thanks to all of you :)
---
What I have found is people who cheat at games are so insecure they need these wins to even kind of feel good about themselves. I imagine it's ultimately hollow so all they have left is ruining other people's days
---
For a change of pace it sounds decent. Not great by any means but if the enemies do respawn I could see it being fun. 
---
This\^\^
---
Is it a Skull outfit? I didn't see another mask.
---
Make Sure I do that
---
And for some workshops there’s a nearby power plant you can restart that will provide much more power. 
---
Mine was more fun, but I think yours was more important.
---
That's all i did.  Multiple sb limited my ability to shoot
---
I think the extra 2 near the start were just in the area and piled on.
---
Im just out here having fun terrorizing people and pvping in this pvp roleplay post apocalyptic world. 
---
Nothing "douchy" about it. Yall need some chill. 
---
Boo hoo 50 wood/steel to rebuild. Thats 10 minutes of farming mats. 
---
Get off my server. 
---

---
All the talk of 45 sub machine guns I was remembering this one from Vegas. 
---
&gt;My complaint is that the damage output of TSEs invalidates most, if not all, current game content.
---
I think that part there is in-line with what I'm saying. There should be content where having these powerful items becomes the necessity. People are going to one shot/two shot things in the regular world no matter what. I've been one shotting things since long before I had an explosive weapon save for the mirelurk queen/scorchbeasts.
---
N'wahs?
---
Wow the first two are excellent
---
" War - War never changes "... A fitting response hehe
---
THANK YOU SIR... 👍🏼 didnt know that fact. makes lot of sense! 🙂
---
Truth be told I normally wouldn't post things like that but a few months ago I was hit by the trade glitch and everyone jumped on the wagon saying with out video I was lying ... Anyway long story short people like to think if they don't know about a bug or it doesn't effect them then it doesn't exist 
---
You can, get the Talons mutation. ;)
---
Sunkissed and Photosynthetic are two VERY underrated perks. With one point in both perks you gain constant, but slow, HP Regen and Radiation Reduction during the day
---
In before his first “stash size is ridiculous” rant
---
Free fast travel to a person's camp, guaranteed and faster, and you can't see other players while wanted. 
---
Level 56, vats rifle with an explosive anti armor pipe bolt action.
---
I ditched the event and smashed through belly of the beast and the daily to kill a sb.
---
Maybe don’t build your camp in a nuke zone? 
---
Morrowind term, old game from Beth in Elder Scrolls series. Quality game if you haven't tried!
---
I found it much easier to craft new armor over time than try to find new pieces. Once I hit 45-50 I started looking for legendaries. 
---
Possibly their space craft?
---

If anyone has these on PC I will pay handsomely.
---
I'm willing to join, I'm playing alone since day 1. PSN: Cirdloc
---
I put down "Vault-Tec Bed 2" and "Simple Modern Bed" to see which one my friend liked more and he said "The Vault-Tec one". I told him that didn't narrow it down at all
---
You know it ;)
---
Same. I ended up taking the shot without me in it because I didn't have an appropriate pose
---
Honestly your best bet is just to build your own. Buy plans at various stations and vendors so that you can craft your own. Then craft/scrap for mods. 
---
I've took them down before in other fallout titles so can't see them being too much of a problem lol
---
Send an invite if you can. Not letting me join.
---
Its randomized every now and then.  I've had  liberator's and they were a super high level.
---
Because people throw a shitfit over everything now. 
---
I didn't find one until level 163.  Don't feel bad.  I found some TS guns and some explosive guns, but no TSEs.  
---
Yes it does 
---
Me and my girlfriend also play together and I'm a level 116 (I'm pretty sure) and she's a level 46 and It is honestly hilarious when something my level (around a level 68) starts running at her because all you hear is *squealing* "BABE HELP MEEEEEE"
---
There last PC patch seems to be causing it. 
---
Amen, Sister!
---
Hot potato!
---
I still have my fast travel mat from beta hehehe
---
Yeah, several Tse weapons are just too powerful. Bringing everything up to them would just trivialize almost all encounters. Sure, some guns aren't as powerful, namely bolt action/semi auto guns which don't benefit from as many explosions and the larger damage drop off of the second shot from receiver buffs that don't carry over to it. But automatic and multiple projectile capable guns can just unleash damage.
---
So I'd say modify explosive to work differently. Instead, anything you kill with it should explode on/shortly after death like legendary robots do. Make it a little weaker until you get explosive perks and then it's slightly stronger. That way it's not some massive dps machine but a great trash clearer. 
---
Liberators are like the mole rats of the robot world 
---
You totally look like a raider mocking them, lol
---
Can't you just move your camp a few feet and have it all plop right back into place? Might cost a few caps, but you save time.
---
I have a level 3 scrounger card running and had noticed that I was averaging about 6 shotgun shells, for example, from ammo boxes. This seems like a low number to be considered 'considerable amount higher' in terms of a potential take on on ammo box with this perk. This thread is telling me there will be another button I have to press on an ammo box (besides the standard X on PS4) or is 6 shotgun shells considered a much higher take than someone not running the perk card?
---
Lol, game hasnt been out for 3 months counting beta. Dude, you are comedy gold. Next it will be that his little old grandma only used it to kill mobs on the way to the Flatwoods church from her camp every Sunday.
---
Yea like Baseball type mini game or event where you shoot Teddy Bears instead, a runner that also need survive against Deathclaws, Super Mutants. 
---
They are referring to walking through a decontamination arch.
---
&gt; Dont need the list to find camps its easy enough... What player isnt on a blue location and isnt moving. I still to use the friends list to find camps sometimes.
---
Can't see people on the map if you are wanted. Your griefer defense fell apart.
---
Wow this actually helps, I just got a deathclaw and now I’ll stay vigilant and in passive mode to make sure they can’t harm it.
---
I wouldn't mind either way. Even without demolition expert the damage is very good.
---
Nuke zones, theyre tough but i leveled 5 times in about 30 mins. 375+ per kill. Todays the last day too since theyll more than likely nerf it with the console update tomorrow. 
---
People are sheep, once one says baaaaah the others say the same thing 
---
Lol almost, try again but with just +karma, or put the next words 2 lines below that. And I posted it up on my profile!
---
No more pvp punishments. Bounty is bad enough.
---
It’s rough isn’t it? I feel like player communication in 76 is pretty weak. Between the 3 different voice channels, the emotes, and ps party audio preferences, it’s hard to get the point across.
---
I can't NOT find a nuked Whitesprings. They always hit the Train too so I miss out
---
PA/flamer team medic here. I'll be glad to join the cause
---
And give up 50% of my range on guns? I don’t think so xD. 
---
Simple answer is mods. Private servers can be modded, so why pay for anything from the atom store when you could mod it in for free.
---
*sees Raiders tag*
---
Hmmmm
---
+karma
---
Why do you assume I built my camp there?
---
Username checks out. 
---
Hmmm... I don't know why it won't work for you. That's the only way I can get it to work myself
---
If you want a non griefing person to play with on PC, welcome\_thr1llho
---
That would make sense, logically speaking, but I’m gonna need a source or testing on this one...
---
I’d love to team up on a sbq kill to see that in action, I’m on Xbox
---
Search decontamination shower. There are a few around the map. Press a button and walk thru like a car wash. Cures rads. 
---
Goddamn you guys complain a lot. 
---
This is super frustrating to see.  I've been killed a bunch because the people I roll with in a team are all different levels, as we all started at different times and we all ended up having our camps very close together to help the lower level players in the team out.  We've been grieved at least once or twice, so now we usually have to keep an eye out on the map if someone high level comes creeping into our camp area.
---
Honestly it would be nice to just have friendly free roam or something where people can't even grief at all, but I know that's too much to ask.  In all seriousness, just need a better way to report players, that are just going on doing "god's work" when they really aren't.
---
It's really unfair to be targeted just cause you look like you're "duping".  
---
life's tough man.
---
Sorry I wouldn't be able to sell it anyways lol, only have one pair. And around 160, it was the Traveling Leather Coat. I bought the Tattered Field Jacket from another player
---
&lt;3 stay awesome
---
Yesterday some kid destroyed my entire camp and racked up a 600 cap bounty. Me and my friend decided to hunt them down, but since he was over encumbered we had to walk to their location. Well as soon as we get to him the server crashes and we both got disconnected. Luckily he still showed up in my recent player list so we joined his world and successful killed him and his friend who helped.
---
I really never engage in PVP but I actually had a lot of fun hunting that kid down, despite being pissed about my camp getting destroyed.
---
Me when my girl brings scorchbeasts home like they’re stray cats. She is 30 levels higher than me, level 67, and she always bring me level 80 scorchbeasts now and they absolutely wreck my house...Love her though, trying to bond with the scorchbeasts. 
---
Bwuhahahaha, er, I mean, that's terrible!
---
I think it's just a leveled loot table. Because I'll find combat rifles and assault rifles on scorched that were dropping pipe and 10 mm when I went through at lower levels.
---
There's a few. They're super beefy, like scorchbeast beefy. I don't remember exactly where but in southern Savage Divide near the nuclear dump site workshop there's a guaranteed spawn.
---
They like the extra carry weight, mods, and maybe they're mining ore?
---
Or maybe they just like the colors. Who knows. ;)
---
What did he say?
---
I think there is also a perk to make them last longer ..
---
Because excavator gives 100 carry weight, plus the 100 carry weight from having two calibrated shocks on it and another 100 carry weight from using the excavator bug.
---
This is a great little find for a low level as well. If you listen to the tape, he gives directions to where he has stashed some stuff. The extra little boost is nice when you're first starting out. For me, it was some stimpacks, ammo and I think a gun. 
---
Well how about I give you the guys Gamertag and you can go ask him? I said 3 months as a rough statement you’re right it has barely been out 3 months - so what like a month or 2 give or take. Wow you really showed me City Dave, now GTFO this thread pls you sad act.
---
Bounties are bounties. At the very least, he accidentally shot someone.
---
Oooh, neat.
---
Thanks outlander.
---
I mean it does help, even if your tickling it maybe it'll laugh and fly away. 😉
---
adds more carryweight, especially in blast zones
---
This and a redditor claiming on here he got banned prior to this patch for fixing wide screen UI. No prof I'll grant you that. But this, plus the fact that Beths does not allow modding just yet, should be enough for us player to exercise caution when it comes down to mods. Wich was my point.
---
And believe me I'd love to install this myself, being a field scribe... Hunting plans is job in the BOS. 
---
Yes I know but I’m lvl 61 and he was lvl 10 he wasn’t able to defend him self that’s why I felt bad for doing it. 
---
This is part of the reason I play crouched all the time. Invisible on map and name bar doesn't appear unless you are really close to me. When I do stand up to trade at a vendor or interact with something, I am only on map for a limited time. Had a guy see me in Watoga and sent me invite. He just needed to fast travel there as he was low on caps. But yeah some people are scum.
---
lol. someone remove this duper's post (inb4 you claim you're not a duper).
---
I am in the same boat. I am half tempted to just walk away for a few months when it will hopefully become more polished and where it needs to be. At least as far as stability and reconnect options go.
---
Carry weight personally keep mine around for hauling otherwise I'm wearing my t-60 in nuke zones and marine armor when not in either.
---
I know you lose caps for being wanted but you also loose them in normal pvp so I didnt know if that included this event or not
---
Yay PvP is bad in f76 I took the converted ammo factory and the guy who owned and his friends show it was a 1v4 me vs them I had tse weapons and I was winning I took they're junk it's when I got bored of kill them and left server with they're junk items I died 3 to 4 times mainly due to killing myself on accident
---
Is there a perk to drink soup whenever you drop below X% of hp ? 
---
FO Fizzicz
---
No grief, u greif
---
Don't power armor shame me boy.
---
These aren't raiders, those people are clowns. A real raider, like me, would shout, "Do you like the sight of your own blood?!" as I chase you down with a pool cue despite you wearing power armor.
---
This guy said 5$ lol 
---
Sweet! Probably bump into ya sometime!
---
So you further exploit the system by reaping bounties from each other, gaining money as well as geting rid of that stigma. You aren't helping your case. at all.
---
Or he tried to get into someone’s house, I did it once before I knew that I’ll get a blunt for doing it 
---
Lvl 45 excavator with calibrated shocks x 2 is +200 wt carry.
---
That is awesome. Just carry a lot of Radway Sims or the right perks and you are gold.
---
She does mad damage with that golf club. It’s instigating, faster swing, and 40% more damage. Scorchbeast is like “Fuck that shit i’m OUT.” 
---
I want Bethesda to see this post and use it as feedback on the state of their PvP
---
Husband and I play together. This is his first real PC game. So first, I started him on Fallout 4 when i was playing beta, so he could get the controls down, then we started on Fallout 76 together when he was more comfortable with the controls etc. 
---
It's fun exploring a new world, while also sharing my Fallout-love with him. It's also nice to travel with a noobie, so that I can slow down and really explore. I am guilty of rushing though a game. It is very nice pace!
---
K thanks I personally still use a mash up of t45 and T51b
---
Thats why i set my camp close to the overseer camp and habd out free level 5 heavy leather armor with additional pockets for free.
---
Yeah its all luck. How its supposed to be. Im pretty sure that over 95% of the godroll weapons out there are duped unless someone has a horseshoe up their ass these weapons would be something everyone would get after 80-90 levels because of nukesprings farming. Hopefully im a special exception but ive played over 120 levels and dont have an honestly earned godroll weapon. And sorry if im missing your point about not a lot of variation in stats but the amount of time it takes to get lucky enough to actually get a good weapon is what gives it the value.
---
I only send team invites out for fast travel purposes. Never thought about this side of things. 
---
This is why I do it.
---
Yea i did that too. Im at 35 and i friended a lvl 12 and a lvl 6 and just ran around with them 
---
Were you hearing the double report? By report I mean the smack sound it makes when it hits a target vs a miss.
---
Somebody can jump in and correct me if I'm off, but a two shot rifle fires two independant bullets each with their own trajectory, the second bullet doesnt follow the exact trajectory as the first and can miss. So it is not double damage all the time, only when you hear the double thwap thwap of two hits.
---
And maybe its just the Tesla that is glitchy, my anti armor handmade takes down gutsy's in 2-4 shots as compared to 8-14 with a base handmade.
---
Not dupes of this particular gun tho I mean!
---
Of course! Thanks for the replies!
---
Look for communistraptor 
---
And he wouldn't have been able to defend himself from the next guy that would have killed him. Someone was gonna kill him for the bounty no matter what, and at level 10, they were gonna get him no matter what. You were the guy collecting the ten caps, that's the only thing that's different.
---
I'm built there. Tried to build inside that room. Wasn't feasible and couldn't place a floor down.  Down below however, is the perfect place to build. If you drop your camp module in the bottom of the U as close to edge towards the extractor as possible, you can build all the way up from the ground. There's a nice hallway in the structure you can place floors and walls all the down, and even have a ceiling. It's a tight fit. Randomly spawns super mutants, dogs, liberators or mole rats nearby. Hit me up on Xbox for a tour. 
---
You gave a dangerous fugitive an explosive gun...
---
This'll end well.
---
In WV the Flatwoods Monster finds you 
---
I personally have more of a problem with the current iteration of explosive weapons, and the interaction between Two-Shot and explosive, than I have a problem with Two-Shot itself.
---
Two-Shot itself on paper is the best prefix for damage, but it is balanced out by bad recoil and spread. Without explosive, I will take an Instigating sniper, or a furious automatic gun, or bloodied for any low health build. But explosive seriously mitigates the accuracy problem with AoE damage, making Two-Shot a different class than the rest.
---
Even without Two-Shot, explosive with cluster weapons is just broken. My hunter's explosive fletchette harpoon gun will one-shot everything except a behemoth, scorchbeast, or Mirelurk queen (yes, including 94 deathclaws if I aim properly at their feet).
---
I am not making this up. I am not alone in this. I am sorry this offends you but Bethesda needs to know this isn't okay. 
---
Misery does love company. But hey. I'm wasteland ballin so destroying my base just refreshes vendors when I leave and block you. Lol. No sweat off my brow. 
---
Oh God that's like me with my sledge, I have a suppressors super sledge it has -20% damage output for 3s, and reflects 50% damage while blocking and I'm pretty sure with my perks and mutations I do around 327 Physical and 13 Energy with it so I murder pretty much everything
---
I know you can find one near the ammo plant. It’s to the south in the mountain but it’s like a mountain surrounding a flat region I don’t know how to describe it. 
---
Dudes been waiting over a month for this gun, you’re just assuming. Go find one then smartass then come back to me and I’ll eat my words :)
---
The issue is you're playing a shared narrative, that has players being dropped into and out of that shared narrative at a moments notice. 
---
Just like how the Junkie behind the flat woods church is "across the river" which is really a creek that is like 8ft wide at most. you cant have 1:1 realism because it just doesnt work. 
---
Just sneak around and snipe them. Crouch in a location where they wouldn't be able to see you and just shoot them. Since they are wanted you do full damage. A good headshot from a sniper should be able to kill them in one hit if you have the right perks and gun, even if they are in power armor. I would have LOVED to cash in on those bounties 
---
Never played Rust I take it?
---
LOVE THIS! It would be challenging and add a whole new flair that 76 was missing from 3...

Slap on the Motion-Assist Servos to eek out another 10 carry.
---
Whitesprings Golf Club. It’s dangerous for your level but make sure you have something that can do heavy damage and bring stimpaks 
---
That’s a good point you’re right to be honest. If it wasn’t me someone else would do it. Normally I would give stuff to a bounty player but he was lvl 10 so I thought he could use the stimpcks. 
---
We lose caps. It only pays out half what you lose when you die.  We have to grind caps to pay for our pvp habbits. 
---
Fact: No greifing in this game. 
---
We had severe lag yesterday on Xbox (way worse than normal), engaged in PvP with some assholes that wouldn't stop attacking our lower level team members, and turned out they had THOUSANDS of various junk items. We went to loot their loot bags and couldn't believe it. It made a lot more sense why it was just so bad, considering three dead bodies had thousands of junk on them. Like bro this is not helping the servers at all.
---
31. Solo. I took pot shots at it while the robots at whitespring took all the hits. 
---
Oh I didn’t thought about it.. 
---
What part isnt working as intended?
---
I usually play solo and I get a team invite almost every time I play and I don't accept for this reason. I don't want them to know where my camp is in case they are griefers.
---
I'm not talking about user reviews, I'm talking about critic reviews, hence why I'm mentioning 50% score - it's the score aggregated by critic reviews. There's not a single "1" in there.
---
Honestly I'm like whatevs, gimme a call once you've played the game for more than 2 hours. Do keep in mind I'm not saying you're wrong for having fun with the game. I'm saying OBJECTIVELY it's not a good game and the score it got by critics is deserved.
---
Great question. I have it on good authority that the license will be banned. So the dupers won't be able to make new characters, as they will be forced to buy another copy of the game and make a new account.
---
I have a team of 4 that I run with and I became friends because they were all so grateful for me giving them junk/aid or crafting weapons/armor for them. The most recent is a funny story actually.
---
I was working from home so AFK for a few mins in FO76 near Morgantown Airport. I here my character getting shot and thinking that the scorched found me I went to deal with that. Turns out it was a level 13 attempting to take advantage of my AFK and kill me. He ran away as soon as he saw me turn around. I killed him to teach him the lesson not to shoot anyone unless you are prepared to die if it comes to that. He was on a team as well and I went to kill the teammate as well since they were hostile now. I began destroying the CAMP with my explosive pump. They logged out and switched servers, but I followed them and reamed their CAMP. The owner ends up on mic yelling at her teammate since he shouldn't have tried to attack me, but the pain in her voice from losing her camp was so great and I felt terrible after. After clearing my bounty I went back to the camp and repaired everything for her. Then basically apprenticed her as well. We went and server hopped 'Powering up Poseidon' to get her the fusion gen plans.
---
The apprenticing thing is something I really enjoy, so long as the player isn't a dick lol. Say thank you when I give you armor, don't complain and say you would rather have caps or junk or start demanding other stuff
---
anything is possible lol
---
If that’s true that would explain why I can never revive my buddy. I always have a few diluted on me. Been thinking of running quack surgeon because I got sick of never even having a chance to revive him. are there any other factors at play? Neither of us run last laugh so idk why I never even get the revive option
---
Exactly... CREATE an in game chat, then provide access to it. This may be more so for console than PC of course
---
I just did the mayor quest to get the all rise to replace my super sledge. im level 70
---
Not enough room cause only 600 pounds
---
Just an FYI, you only need 1 point in rad sponge and the 3 charisma to share it to protect your entire team. The second and third tiers are unnecessary and can be used for more useful perks.
---
&gt; The rest are brown bag garbage.
---
As a lower player, brown bags laying around the nuke area are my favorites. usually better stuff than I can get with my own slow kill rate there. Most of the time far higher than I can use yet, but still every once in a while a gem in my level range that makes my day.
---
You can rebuild it blueprint but all detroyed items have to be remade so require the Mats.
---
That's a lot of junk to collect to rebuild something that takes 100s of mats to make.
---
Outside of the typical "OMG Bethesda sucks" reviews on YouTube, people gave the rum good reviews.
---
It dooooes work in combat, but not enough to effectively heal during combat. It's main use, in my opinion, serves as a free and easy way to heal up completely between fights.
---
From almost dead with tons of Rads to full HP and no Rads, takes about 120 seconds with just the Rank 1 versions of both perks.
---
Endurance perks are really underrated. There are many that make surviving a breeze. My main perks for it are Rank1 Sunkissed &amp; Photosynthetic, Good Boy, and Aqua Boy. Always healing from damage and Rads, can fill up on one can of dog food that never expires, and don't have to worry about environmental water hazards
---
similar thing happened to me, sat outside vault 76, without armor on, for an hour hoping someone would clear my bounty, a dozen people or more passed by and never did.
---
As others have mentioned ITT, anti armor beings the pen value to the upper 80s.
---
+200 carry weight; 100 from full armor plus another 50 for each calibrated shock.
---
You also get more resources from mining nodes. One of my favorite spots normally nets me over 1000 lead before super duper procs using excavator. Bullets for days!
---
Is any of that lead tied up in a mod thats in your stash box?
---
Sure, post his gamertag here. And I'm sure I could believe everything he says. Thanks for making it personal shows you're a class act to go with my sad one.
---
We need a better way to highlight the bags we drop. Its much easier to drop many items then to trade them. Most people I try to give stuff to just emote me back and then run along without actually even seeing the bag. Even when I'm on mic and telling them what I've dropped for them in this bag.
---
Wait, I thought it was new duping causing disconnects, it's "PC: Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability."
---
I’ve gotten random invites .. I always just assume it’s people with the perk cards who just need teammates for the buff. Never thought of this, damn. 
---
I agree, I would just ask for simplier thing for now ;-)
---
I learned this about Butcher's Bounty at about level 50, but I was zero days old (and level 103) when I learned that the same thing applies to the *other* perks you mentioned — thank you very much!
---
Note (maybe this will be someone else's "day zero" since you learned it): 
---
You can equip the cards *after* the MOB is dead, even if someone else killed it, and still get meat. And I've usually got something else I want to be doing with my Perception points, so I don't leave them equipped. But if you've encountered killed a herd of mole rats, equip the Butcher's Bounty card *after you've killed them*, then do the search function and collect the extra meats, then replace the card. 
---
I love the game. I couldn't stand Fallout 4 and it was entirely boring without players.
---
That being said, I wish PVP worked better. I want to fight more players and I think players should drop a considerable more amount of caps. I also think there needs to be raids, more end game content.
---
I believed we needed a player driven market like Escape from Tarkov has and player-vendors with players being able to take on roles like merchants.
---
I believe that is coming in the future. To that point as well, the game needs human raiders, some small human NPC settlements and more end-game content to keep the incentive going. After lvl 50 there's no reason if you spec'd properly into your SPECIAL.
---
I have all 18 mutations, might try my luck and remove a few but definitely need to have a think if i'd rather walk slow and have mutations or ditch them entirely till class freak.  
---
I wonder what other ways there are to increase AP (only agility 3 for this build) and what the minimum is to avoid this bug.
---
Replying so I can see this later with photos. If it works as you say, this will be incredibly helpful.
---
I dropped my pimped out two shot combat rifle with 50% limb damage when i was doing Patrol Duty to a 20ish lvl player that tagged along. That thing was just too recoily for me and i think he might have been overly joyed to get one. 
---
Seems like a series of unfortunate events, more so than an issue with game mechanics . 
---
Yeah, unfortunaly I have only seen a dude once with the dress.... Which is fitting I guess, since the  mistress of mistery always works in the shadows
---
Id assume it's a melee but Idk I play heavy guns 
---
Yeah, but moving the base moves the base. Does it keep the built items in the same condition or does it just store them and let you rebuild them? I thought it was the latter.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
It's because you were overencumbered
---
Yeah even from before the B.E.T.A., Forbes seemed to have it out for Bethesda. Their reviews were beyond toxic
---
Well yeah thats kinda my point, i believe it when i see it living pictures. 
---
My husband and I have the same work schedule so we rush home after work every day since BETA and get out of our work clothes and jump into our power armor. We have done almost no quests outside of the Enclave, dropped nukes together and both do the walk of shame back to our camps after a couple of hours in nukesprings. He is 160 and I am 130, mostly since he goes around farming high level enemies for loot while I forage food and materials. 
---
We are introverts and thus stay home everyday gaming. We have had some weekends where we stay up for over 24 hrs just playing games together. I wouldn't have it any other way. 
---
My carry weight without PA: 220.
---
My carry weight with Excavator: 315.
---
My carry weight with Excavator with 2 sets of shocks: 415.
---
My carry weight with Excavator with 2 sets of shocks after logging out and back in: 515.
---
I actually just replaced mine with X-01 for serious fights, but I still keep Excavator for farming/fast travelling.
---
Nah, not posting here for others to abuse him. If you want his Gamertag SO BADLY to confirm the facts
---
- you can private message me and I’ll give you his info.
---
Anyways, nothing personal was said, but ok snowflake see you around with more neg posts 😘
---
That’s what I need; an “I can’t hear you “ emote
---
Mama Dolce's Food Factory, just south west is a booby trapped workshop that can spawn it.  Very easy to get to, easy server hop.  Keep at it until you get a full set of level 25 T45.
---
Or if you wanted even lower.  The Crosshair up in the Northwest can spawn level 15 Raider Armor.  Do the same, hop until you get it all.
---
Also at level 25 you can do the Miner Miracles quest and get the complete Excavator Set.
---
I'm glad that you enjoyed it, and that's the most important point. 
---
I feel like FO76 may not be the worst, but certainly not a "fantastic" game. Here below my thoughts :
---
\- To me, I won't buy it because I miss the NPC that made the game feel alive, and I miss NOT having an end goal (may it be a campaign, or multiplayer raids/dungeons). 
---
\- I also feel like social interactivity is pretty limited. For an RPG, where there are no NPC, I feel like the game lacks some stuff (factions, text chat, player hub, radio broadcasts)...).
---
\- When you come from Skyrim and New Vegas, the fact that you have no "real" quests (from the stream I saw, the quest are basically fedex quests), NPC, dialogue options, or basically roleplay options, it feels more like a "walk with friends" simulator
---
(- I haven't played the game (still to expensive for my friends and I), but there is apparently the same issue as in borderlands, where player would duplicate weapons, and even worse, sell weapons for real life money. This ruins the balance but I guess it may not imapct loads of player)
---
Anti-armor actually does make a difference and is a good effect in its own right. Nowhere close to TSE though sadly, but worth using especially if you have armor piercing perks or mods on your weapons too as they do stack to a certain degree. 
---
Would there be radiation damage like in a nuke zone? If so booo. It's bad enough how normal armor is penalized in current endgame.
---
The Pro is definitely smoother and the lighting is a bit nicer, but there's not enough difference to make me go out and buy a Pro if I didn't already have one.
---
Raider Power Armor starts at level 15, I believe.  
---
More info here. [https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-power-armor-location-guide/](https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-76-power-armor-location-guide/)
---
Yet he couldn’t dupe food for his people. BURN 
---
Nope groups=dupers
---
* T-45 / Excavator Power Armor - Level 25
---
* T-51b Power Armor - Level 30
---
* T-60 Power Armor - Level 40
---
* X-01 Power Armor - Level 45
---
* Ultracite Power Armor - Level 50
---
In addition, Raider Power Armor can spawn at Level 15, 25, 35, or 45.
---
So you can use Raider Lvl 15, T45, or Excavator. Raider and T45 are a hassle, you just have to keep checking the PA spawns and they randomly have T45 / T51 or T60 (Raider PA spawns have one of the 4 raider versions). But excavator is a sure thing - it is part of the [Miner Miracles](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles) quest
---
Thought this was old news?
---
Since PVP seems to be turning into the engame content / meta, I've been curious about it myself. I've already had a number of amusing encounters. I killed a non-wanted level 5 player by blasting them in the head with a bloodied gamma gun and they died practically instantly (maybe they hit me back, not sure). Another time I killed myself with that same weapon by shooting a player while too close to them. Or the time I purposely got a bounty on my head and when the TSE-weilding Ultracite-armored bounty hunter showed up and we managed to kill each other the instant we got within striking distance (which resulted in us giving the thumbs-up emote to each other).
---
Last night I was tracking someone down who had a bounty on their head. I tracked them down to 'New GAD' just south of Summersville and when I got close I realized there were two other players. I acted too quickly to realize it but it seemed they were using emotes to communication who was going to do the honors of killing the wanted player. Anyway, I jumped from behind a barrier, rushed the wanted player from behind, and downed them with one hit from my instigating super sledge. The prompt appeared for me to stimpack them and I was like WTH so I stimpaked them back up. Then I hit them two more times, killed them, and collected the (small) bounty. I backed up and faced the remaining two players and, in my excitement I couldn't think of the appropriate emote to use so, I used the heart emote and then took off. I imagine they were like WTF was that all about?
---
Probably duped
---
Not if they had taken the weight of my junk off, I wasn't. It's a flawed system. The junk is in a bag I don't carry it anymore, so was under weight.
---
 That means I should've been light enough to go wherever and get my loot. Then be over encumbered again. 
---
About to start final part of it
---
So your idea of helping people out is removing ant satisfaction they would ever obtain from earning it the normal way?
---
Possibly nerfed or perks to reduce explosive damage taken, not removed tho that’s too far. You’re right tho, this gun chews everything in 1 hit except the SQB’s and Queen
---
Believe me, i would use another power armor if they had better carry weight. Its dumb how u dont carry more stuff in other power armor without mods
---
They said Tuesday I believe. 
---
Are you thirsty? Sometimes when my thirst is in the red the Radaway won’t work until I drink something. 
---
It doesnt. 
---
At most: that + less than 5 of a few other resources: springs, circuit, gears etc. 
---
If you have a re - placeable design, you could just store it and drop it again for free .
---
Yall have no reason to be upset. Have fun and fight back. Or server hop like whiney bitches and be mad that bethesda didnt make the game you wann play. It aint on me. Im just pvpin
---
Don't forget a decent chunk of caps for a player just starting out.
---
That's actually one of my favorite things in this game. A "quest" without a marker that you have to figure out yourself, even if it is very simple.
---
lol, 5 pounds is 'heavy'
---
*Cries on his pile of 18lb rifles*
---
Your ego is huge bro. Enjoy your lifetime achievement. /s
---
I bought the game in December to play with my two buddies. Our first hour included 17 crashes and each of our consoles being bricked twice each.
---
You have the advantage of playing it for the first time after 60gb of patches when the game is in a somewhat acceptable state. 
---
I'll say what I've said all along - if you enjoy the game that's great, you're absolutely entitled to enjoy the shit out of it, but please don't act like Bethesda don't deserve the hate they've been getting. That's just looking at the games content, I'm not even going to get into the freight train of controversies and how horribly they handled each one or the atom store.
---
Ah yes I can fight back when some twat destroys my base and logs off or has his friend remove the bounty at little risk. 10/10
---
It’s more like your “legitimate understanding of science” has piss-all to do with this practically fantasy fi-sci game. 
---
No man totally, if that’s the proper score and not user score then that sucks :( 
---
I’ll likely revisit this thread when I’ve played it more no doubt. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Except I didn’t purposely log out there. My game crashed.
---
Its a pain.  It took me about 40 server hops
---
Sounds like an attempt to get super high bounties to get a shit ton of caps
---
I have also witnessed a group of players going round killing low level players with their TSE guns and then killing each other to remove the bounty, they weren't teamed up in the game mechanics but were obviously together, saw this from a cliff as they took out 2 players camps east of the rails at Whitespring
---
Mad? Not a huge ego but just a zero tolerance for low life, assuming, neg shit posters like yourself and City Dave.

You build a new one with level 45 components to update the stats and use for mining and hauling as it gives the extra carrying capacity.  Its good enough for most combat too. I have the Ultracite and X01 versions and I still wear Excavator a lot for the purposes mentioned.
---
Yes they changed the date on Twitter to Tuesday 
---
Comments are acting so surprised that griefers and trolls are present in online games. It was made clear months ago that this would be and most people seem to have forgotten all those rants. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I want them all to leave us alone but so many are acting shocked about it. 
---
I totally agree.  They *added* a benefit to the fireproof perk to reduce explosive damage.  Now they just need to *add* a perk that debuffs enemies DR but increases their explosive resistance 100%.
---
"creating", you mean reskinning a dragon from Skyrim ?
---
So that's why the wendigo was wearing the clown costume!
---
&gt; But excavator is a sure thing - it is part of the Miner Miracles quest
---
Bonus, doing it gives you the Power Armor Station camp plans
---
Ah, finally. After a lot of stealth, a little luck, and wasting all my ammo I am ready to engage this boss. Careful aim... and nailed him!  
---
Controls are locked.

resume game for a second, half dead, boss is pounding on you  
---
Game resumes again long enough to show you the death animation.  
---
Controls locked.

You have been disconnected from the server!
---
You will grow very very tired of this quickly.
---
Thanks for the answer..  
---
So… https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/T-45+Explosive+Shielding doesn't exist… ? :'(
---
Maybe. Lots of people might buy it who don’t actually drink or enjoy rum. In such an instance, it’s an expensive curio. A friend of mine bought one. We agreed that the rum was not something either of us would ever drink again on purpose, but she liked the novelty bottle itself. I think it’s ok for what it is, but it just doesn’t look like $100. When I see it, I think carnival prize. 
---
So, based on feedback, it seems like you need one of two things to be able to trigger this event:
---
1. Prerequisite quest described in the post
---
2. To have participated in Patrol Duty, begun by someone else, at least once
---
Go forth and patrol!
---
Theyre glitched. It says ive learned 1 cooking recipe. Same for me with the perk cards. Make a friend i still dont have and ive added people to my friends list and made friends with that deathclaw.
---
My wife and I are both doctors so our schedules are hectic sometimes, but we always try to find those days we work the same shifts so we can come home and play together. You think couples would be sick of each other when they got home after working stressful hours with each other...but not us, and i too wouldn’t have it any other way than to come home and spend even more time with my wife on a game we both love. 
---
There needs to be real consequences to a life of crime. In this game, you die and lose a couple caps. In real life, there a heavier consequences to an action and I think it would make for more interesting gameplay if those choices actually stuck with a player for a longer term.  
---
I really did like the Karma system in the older games. 
---
My bet holds.  It’s not Zetan.  By the way, what you just said removed all relevance from everyone’s opinions, because it’s Science Fiction controlled by Bethesda.  How’s that for piss all to do with it smart ass
---
I’m lvl 130 and never seen it
---
The problem with dumping in suitcases is that it seems after initially looting them they never spawn more loot, so there's no reason to check them beyond random player drops like this... I know that the cash register doesn't really spawn anything useful beyond useless pre-war money but at least they are very close to the vendor and easy to happen upon or check if you know.
---
How big is the patch supposed to be on consoles?
---
Who downvoted this?? I appreciate it. 
---
Nice one thanks buddy 
---
Raider sounds more like it, I stole all of my BOS gear from a corpse anyway.
---
There is one on the head on a spike at the Freak Show. :)
---
Raiding implies that you are getting something out of the raid
---
**What the fuck do you get out destroying a base?** 
---
Laughter? knowing that someones hard work is destroyed with no purpose?
---
Only conclusion is that you like being an asshole
---
That's a shame. 
---
&gt; You got mutated creatures where you live?
---
Based on the posts, we know of at least one.
---
Thru don't really monitor reddit much...
---
The other day someone used New Gad and I couldn’t find any enemies for about 10 minutes and then I ran into hordes of level 68 super mutants who were dropping radiation materials. First time I’ve seen that. 
---
I wish all interiors worked like during Monster Mash at Watoga High School, but for disconnects.
---
I nuked the place once, but the problem is there aren't many legendary mobs there.
---
I also am a huge fan. A couple co-workers and I were lololing at work over it. 
---
That's a very detailed response. Thank you so much.
---
It's gotta be the diluted stimpaks. I think the game defaults to them first. I'm not sure if the diluted stimpaks interfere with Quack Surgeon or not. I would drop them in your stash just to be sure. 
---
Bethesda doesn't have shit for end game contetnt so what do you expect us to do
---
&gt;You can always server hop like a bitch.
---
Maturity. Maturity never happens.
---
Ooh, or the Power Armor bug.  
---
Wait! where is my PA? Not in inventory, not in stash. NOOOooooooo! It had all my good mods!
---
What if FEV is just alien blood and radiation. Westtek wasn't making the stuff the were milking it from captured aliens
---
I’ll up vote it to combat the strange downvote lol 
---
Oh wait, I don't like using PA because of how cheesy it is. Just slurping all the stims the moment I take a chunk of damage in PvP cause "It's more skill!"
---
Must be a challenge to inject as many stims into yourself at once.
---
I'm on console. With diluted stimpaks in my inventory, I get no option at all to revive people. 
---
My wife always tells me melee is the way to go, but I don’t like to admit she’s right..I love my sniper build too much! 
---
A giant sloth hangs around a workshop in the mire.
---
&gt; Get off my server.
---
Your server? Fuck off mate.
---
Did you really think you could fool me with your duped meme?
---
Snipers are very very fun too😉
---
1) if they're using exploits, they are doing the opposite of putting way too much time into a game, since the exploit is to avoid spending lots of time.
---
2) what at all about this means people don't have jobs or make REAL money? Ever heard of working remotely, or maybe that their exists jobs that are not M-F 9-5 schedules?
---
3)Lastly I'm curious as to how exactly this is fucking it up for everyone else? (Like legit questions because I have found myself impacted 0% by people duping and exploiting and I am one of those people who comes home from work to enjoy a game they love)
---
I've been doing this ever since the patch .. keep calling supply drops near flatwoods just to see lowbies get bounties... it is hilarious and nobody knows it's me! .. well they didn't until now
---
For days?
---
They could name it the *Neverland Ranch Server*
---
I had level one eyebots , with legendaries, spawn in there once time.  Got myself quite a few level 1 legendary weapons and armor pieces. 
---
Sounds like the workshops had a memory leak... not sure but that could be a culprit as well. I got rolled back a few times this weekend. I hope they fix or do somthing about the duplication issue. 
---
Dirty Chinese jumpsuits. 
---
I think alcohol is very often subjective, so I certainly expect that some (maybe many; maybe most) people like the rum used for Nuka Dark. 
---
I think Lagavulin is the greatest liquor the world has ever seen, but my wife thinks it’s tastes like actual, literal dirt. 
---
Otherwise she’s a perfect person.
---
Most people just downvote things that can be easily searched
---
This is exactly why I never accept team invites unless I talk to the person first. I’m lvl 29 and have had people send me invites to just basically fuck with me/one shot me lol. It gets super annoying! 
---
I really wished someone figured out the level mechanics for this. Level 200 here and the highest I've tamed was level 30 sloth with around 15-20 hours of encounter farming. 
---
3k ultracite ammo? Hmm.
---
sounds like we got another one boys, im not even gonna bother reading all that. u care 2 much 
---
I want solid color skins for PA, all basic colors...white green blue red. Just solid color no embellishments.  Maybe make each color a set with very minor variations, for example clean white, worn out white, rusted white. 
---
Can we have the option to wear baseball caps backward...I would actually buy them if I could.
---
Military theme PA skins. Army, navy, air force and Special forces would be a nice.
---
Some skins for the military combat armor.
---
Clean black suit...come on Beth.
---
It's the One61 studio watch: [https://one61.com/products/fallout-smartwatch](https://one61.com/products/fallout-smartwatch)

I'm thinking about getting one but I'm not sure the battery lasts long enough to be useful.
---
can Bethesda higher some modders?
---
Acting like people lost sleep and begged over not being legendary hunting rifles. Servers are crashing, enemies are weak as hell, game has more bugs than **Assassin Creed Unity,** and 98% of the community secretly praying "Please don't let TES6 be like this lord" and you were waiting for LEGENDARY HUNTING RIFLES! we have bigger problems! (ಠ\_ಠ)  
---
What happens if you need a ranged attack? What do you use then?
---
i had one daily 2 days in a row after that i never seen it again. Unfortunatelly i already frogot what was that since i got it during beta but now i never seen it again. I was so confused when it "worked" for 2 days in a row and then just stopped appearing ever again. Once i didnt even have any dailys for entire day even though it was a first log in after some time playing other stuff.
---
Thank you. Why are people having strokes over people duping and exploiting. Go ahead and report it but don't then be pissy and ranting even outside of the game. By concerning yourself with this and raging you are the one who is causing your own dis-pleasurable experience.
---
That sounds promising. Hopefully others can start getting the event to start after going through the quest.
---
I didn't consider a personal cooldown which persisted through servers, that's interesting. I don't think that affects my experiences though because I only try to trigger the event when I'm on a new server via normal play instead of hopping. I think my 1/4 is from the internal cooldown of the server itself (2ish hrs, I believe) and the fact that there's another event that can trigger in its place. However, it's useful for other people so they don't server hop too quickly after finishing and waste time.
---
If you really want some fun: Gun-fu, Four Leaf Clover, Better Criticals, Critical Savy, and add in Chameleon, Speed Demon, and Marsupial. You'll never look back and no one will see you coming &gt;:)
---
"excellent game". The game may not be as horrible as some say, but calling it "excellent" ???
---
Half life 2 was excellent, Mario bros is excellent, Zelda ocarina of time is excellent but FO76 can't really be called excellent with it's bug and \[insert dozens of issue already menhtionned\]
---
Are you guys 9?
---
Mothership Zeta has a Vault Tec Executive that's asked by them about VAULT 76. The executive is willing to talk with them, but starts screaming as they come in a probin' anyway.
---
My guess, as always, is that the first bomb was dropped by Vault Tec itself. 
---
Zetans could've been in cahoots though. What better way to study this new species than to partner with the organization locking them in metal shells and conducting experiments while any potential retaliation against invasion is neutralized by the bombs? 
---
76 is not a control vault. Something is weird and special about us. It IS especially odd that NO ONE is left alive when we come out. There should've been someone, somewhere. This isn't a design failure, I have a distinct feeling it's story related and will be addressed moving forward.
---
I went to the Morgantown airport again the other day just to poke around a bit. Read a log saying that one of the head honchos was *insisting* on the Responder training system get installed in Flatwoods as they were *expecting* a large influx of refugees needing that basic information. What? From where? This wasn't fresh after the bombs, they'd been holed up in the Airport for a minute. Pretty sure Charleston had already had its post war disaster. 
---
Why would they build this entire system specifically for *large quantites* of people at once, when the only logins on the Responder terminals are scattered at best, survivors leaking in and out bit by bit? Wouldn't they be focusing a bit more on survival and helping those alive? 
---
This is essentially the leaders of the Responders building out Flatwoods for *us*. We wouldn't be coming out of the Vault for a hot minute. Did he know we'd be coming? Was he ordered by someone to build it? Was that order pre-war or post-war? 
---
There's decent breadcrumbs insisting we're in a simulation of sorts. Entertaining that idea gets a little too real. We have things built for us to learn to adapt. No robot NPC in game has a fully developed personality, they're either psuedo 1-dimensional, or hindered in some way. Even MODUS admits that his personality systems have been.... damaged. Perhaps this simulation can't fool us with a dynamic personality. The only people with layers are our fellow Vault Dwellers. 
---
We're trained by Responders, Firebreathers, and VERY quickly inoculated against the Scorched "plague" that's afflicted everything else. Don't exactly pick up the plague if you ignore that quest and go get crop dusted by the Scorch Beast Queen, do you?
---
Bread crumbs align perfectly. Free States quests are absurdly hand-holdy with Abbies ridiculous amount of holotapes for every potential outcome. 
---
The Brotherhood literally did everything they could and came within inches of handling the Scorchbeast issue in the Glassed Caverns near Fissure Site Prime.
---
As a cohesive story, the theme resonates well without the conspiracy. Each faction didn't trust each other, so all of their advantages stayed separate where they could've come together to conquer the threat. A heart-wrenching thought and feeling encountered throughout the Wasteland as you learn about what they went through and what they were able to achieve despite the struggle. 
---
Throw in the simulation evidence we see in the bunker on that one terminal log, the "NOTHING IS REAL" painted in the Watoga High School, and I believe I've seen it elsewhere as well. Entertain the questions of "why" from throughout your travels. All of the sudden, the emotional pull of the story is called into question. Take your heart out of the equation, and things get a little *too perfect*, while seemingly lacking elsewhere. In a way that a game designer would *not* build a world unless there was intent in the action. A lazy story with holes looks a *whole* lot different than this. 
---
The 0 human NPC angle is one incredible risk to take for a company, especially with their first Creation Kit multiplayer port game. They told us about the NPC's how early? They knew it wasn't going to be received with ooo's and ahhh's. It's a mental red flag and question mark to any gamer. Reasons given for it were not totally complete. Wanting the players to be the life of the game was the general gist. Not much beyond that. The lack of NPC's was put to the wayside as they leaked information to us, mostly about the multiplayer experience, maybe little bits about why the BoS could be in WV, stuff like that. 
---
The lack of living NPC's can NOT be a decision made from one line of reasoning being as much human to human interaction as possible. I mean, we literally *do have* NPC's. They're just bots. They could've told the same exact story with a majority-99% of all humans being dead, but including some here and there for flavor. It would've been an incredible impact going 30 hours in and you see your first human, albeit on their last legs or whatever. But no one is here. Literally no one. They're all conveniently dead RIGHT when we come out on a scheduled day. You find bodies, semi fresh, dead where they sit in some cases with no evidence of a struggle or desperation. It is just TOO weird.
---
There's something fishy going on. Our characters are on rails created within the narrative itself, and they're not meant to notice. Our final questing area is with MODUS, a super computer with obvious (mildly hidden) sentience, in a bunker with a faction that by all accounts should be the enemy of any average Fallout American. We walk in ready to smash some heads, and MODUS talks us down saying, ohhhh I'm just the guy that runs this place, I was built to help this organization of people in here and yeah man they were *totally* the bad guys. They imploded with their bad decision making and infighting. Really did a number on me too wooo-wee! I'm not a baddy though (please don't look at the assaultron body by the vault bunker door!). Maybe we can dig through all of the "rubble" here and figure out those pesky Scorchbeasts for you! Of course I'm willing to help, I'm just a friendly computer system, utilize me! My best solution says, nuclear bombs! That's what the last denizens were here trying to do. What were they trying to bomb? Why China! Only the fools thought they might be in a simulation and China is likely only a *town* where the simulations servers are stored. Crazy right? Bet they'd be grrrreat against that Scorched issue you got going though. Here, set up satellite links, some of which I've never had access to via Sugar Grove, a secret government program developing several creepy techs, then I'll let you "rank up" enough to enter the war room where I conveniently have the tools needed with basic illustrations for potentially "stupid" generals (?) that might need a bit more info.
---
We get UFO sightings from players as well. Several have seen a ship in the distance after they've finished up at the SBQ (maybe elsewhere too, not sure). 
---
How interconnected is everything? How much do we know about the truth of the matter, 80%? 50%?... 30%?
---
Lots of questions. And I have a lot of crazy ideas on it. Really do think aliens are a big part of the bigger picture though, considering we had Zeta breadcrumbs how many years ago? Aliens and Vault-Tec are still the 2 most mysterious entities in the Fallout lore. Even the big bad Enclave struggles heavily all across the world, usually hindered by lone vault dwellers. Fallout 2 even says that to many it seems difficult to wonder who could've benefited from such destruction in the first place.
---
Probably the people/maybe aliens that are still a mystery.. yeah?
---
Realize, they just fixed a HUGE exploit (duping bug) that they let go bn on for 5 weeks (so you missed all that recent drama). It was the cause of servers constantly crashing. I myself have refused to play during that time. 
---
This game shipped waaaaay to early. I paid $80 and it was an Early Access game.
---
&gt; ook them down before in other fallout titles so can't see them b
---
oh boy... they between the power level of an Scorched Beast and an Mirelurk Queen. Closer to a Mirelurk Queen.
---
Haha im gonna do this too, but can you tel me where to call the supplies ? It tells it can be done only on a special terminal. And I don’t know where it is 
---
Probably didn't even think it up themselves. Someone else did it to them or they saw it on some dumb youtube video while painting in their momma's poop closet. 
---
I regularly get Combat Armor from the Forbidden knowledge quest, although it's about 1in5 times it gives it but I bought a least 3 of my combat armor gear from the Watoga vendors after a run of scorch queen fights, all 3 star. My chest piece has a weight of 0 due to having a weightless star and added the reduced weight mod to it.
---
Honestly it is so much easier to spend a few days gathering caps through the guaranteed 1400 a day and if lucky the extra 400 from the 2 random vendors, then just server hop to prime site nukes and check the vendors, I haven't dropped below 6k caps in a week or more.
---
They can be killed?
---
LOL . I was in WS station waiting to trade when some wanted dude came in. Level 50ish, 10 cap bounty, he was chill. Some other level 13 was in there too, waiting to trade. I thought, why not? SO I shot him. Nothing happened. OH, you have to have pacifist off. OK. So I shot him a few more times to get his attention. He turns to me and stands there without moving. So I turn pacifist off and kill him. I stand by his bag and wait until he collects it then I leave. The level 14 just stood there watching. 
---
I really want to do some PVP but damn it's confusing. And I'm told that if I don't have enough caps to cover the bounty, I will get a debuff on my stats. I'm told it's -3 to all specials for 24 hours. Welp I guess I could live with that.
---
When would I need that? In that case I guess I'll pick a weapon up and use in those special moments
---
This game randomly disconnects so often that jumping servers in the middle of a grief is a no brainer any more.  
---
I spent fifteen minutes and a thousand rounds going after a glitchy SBQ and get nothing when it crashes, I don’t see any reason to put up with bored 12 year olds with nothing better to do than cost me time and effort. 
---
Squad of TSE addicts murdering my workshop? Might as well jump to a server without them on it and take it again.  
---
That's dumb XD are you on xbox? I'm happy to run people through
---
Beaten x girlfriend? Wow, a bit of incel mixed in eh? Fits the profile.
---
Awesome. I was already working on an explosive build before I found the pistol so my explosive perks are maxed. I'm thinking of getting a new 1 ⭐ grenadier perk though cause I keep getting caught in my own explosions.
---
Its my base now. I sit on it until you leave my server. 
---
I get disconnected far more often than I log out. Only online game I've had that problem with.
---
Why are you actively on this sub? 🎣 
---
Have had no issues with disconnects, until I visit white springs then I get disconnected 5 times in an hour. 
---
I avoid heavily populated areas due to the server lag... Oh and the fact there's no fun loot left. 
---
To be perfectly honest, I simply assumed that the collar needed to be equipped. It would make sense from a realism perspective (how else would the robots know you're an "escaped convict?"), But maybe Bethesda didn't go that far for whatever reason.
---
Now they are - yes, but my point is that all competent MP devs would put the account restrictions in Admin/GM restricted areas from the launch of the public beta. 
---
I think most companies do. Maybe not 24/7 but the do check it on the Reg. 
---
Seems like theyre witholding Atoms haha
---
I normally pick all ammo up from boxes and when looting enemies and do a swap an ammo with teams mates every now and then.

Killed the super mutants (6ea) at the camp by whitesprings resort, who had 500+ 5mm on each body.

Tesla coil mod I found let’s me stand in white springs and tag everything till I know everyone got a hit in.

I’m on console and I feel the same I even have the perk that makes cores last 2x but I could swear I was fighting the queen and burned through like 5 in that short span. I do have a jet pack but I rarely use it which is weird.
---
i seen my first Two Shot LMG at level 14
---
i’m now level 86 and still never got a TSE
---
I really don't think the makers of Fallout 76, know how to fix this problem, I got my first character to level 108, decided to do a different build so I created another character, and its just the same.  This game would be fun, if it wasn't f\*\*king broken, this game might be worth playing if 90%+ of all the things in it actually oh, I don't know "WORKED",  and this error code, I'm sure that you aren't the first person to mention this to Bethesda, and I'm sure you won't be the last, but does anyone see them fixing it? Anyone?
---
I played the B.e.t.a. and believe it or not, I didn't get kicked out of the game as much as when the game started on launch day, I mean in all my years of playing video games, 37+ years, and online since they came out, this is by far the worst piece of \*\*\*\*\*\*\* that I have ever had the displeasure of playing, and I know what your thinking if you don't like it so much why play it, and I'll answer that, its not for the 200+ times I've been kicked out of it, the infinite amount of new bugs/old bugs, new glitches/old glitches, or the "team" mode that most of the time doesn't work without at least one or more people having to turn off their system multiple times just to get it to work, or having it say your on a team in the menu, but not on the screen, no its none of that its the outrageous amount of money I was stupid enough to pay for it.. 
---
All I can say is that I've lost respect for most video game companies throughout the last 20 years, but Bethesda is right at number one; because I believe that they just don't care about the people that play their games.
---
Easily obtainable - can walk you through it if you like :) combo of buying flux for cheap on market76 and then mass crafting with super duper perk and ammosmith.
---
Lowest I've heard of is level 10. Anything after that is up to RNGesus and luck.
---
That may have been the community I play with, we usually have about 14 people farming white springs and when the nuke zone clears we all dump the legendary's we don't want into that cooler and then tell everyone its up for grabs. people seem happy after wards....its the small things

I wouldn’t just drop it. I’d ask them if they wanted some. And it’d only help them till level 5 or until it breaks.  I’m not gunna force em to take it.
---
PS4 was helping some lower level characters another group of guys killed him repeatedly with a drill. Apparently using the drill doesn't cause you to have a wanted level. They we're using the drill on everyone in a nuked whitesprings. If you shot at them after they attacked you then you got a wanted level and their group immediately fired on you with explosive weapons so they could take your loot. Good plan in the nuke zone just figured that damaging a low level with a drill enough to kill them should be considered attacking another player so that you get a wanted level.
---
You had me at giant enemy robot boss :)
---
Even with me rapidly tapping i still have to aim at each one. Are you on PC? Maybe the new update changed that.
---
Im on xbox one x
---
It would most likely display one of your own pictures saved on that particular xbox because of how the photos are stored. Even moving to another xbox with the same account means all my photos and id's are blank. 
---
ah i gotcha, 
---
why did you get downvoted for this answer lol? is it wrong? i don't know if it's right or wrong, but if it's right it would definitely make sense of the relatively high weight of 90% weight reduced weapons
---
You inspired me to build a disguised shop. 
---
It works by buttons, too! 
---
Also can be placed outside Whitesprings.
---
After 250 hours, most of which above level 100, I've never seen one drop.
---
Close to 100 hours is simply farming.

Trade for them

It's a function of the Xbox not the game. 
---
You make a good point, so what melee weapon/s do you use?
---
Very few games allow you to loot every item that an enemy was theoretically carrying.  Imagine how hard it would be to loot legendary items if the Scorched who was carrying that TSE rifle was able to shoot at you with it.
---
Legendary weapons noob here.
---
Does the handmade prefix mean you actually made it yourself or is it still a drop?
---
I suppose it's a drop since from what I know legendaries only come from drops, you can't craft them.
---
Yeah it sucks they removed rad decay on death it was incredibly helpful … now no matter how many times you die consecutively you don't lose rad damage .. if you're out of rawdawg and can't find any at the moment, the university is a great place to pick some up.
---
Also there's decon. showers at each of the power plants inside, most of the mines(easiest is the one east of white springs) and at the disposal sites, the one to the far east is actually really good cause it has epically radiated barrels right next to it for farming mutations if that's your fetish.

Im already pretty much doing that.

For me, camp items, and pretty much nothing else.
---
CAMP raids are not a game mechanic when players only get slap damage if they don't wan't PvP. Eventually Bethesda will fix this loophole. Why don't you tell us your gamertag so we can truly reward you for your Raider play :)
---
this is what the dupers have done make people think these are and should be commonplace weapons 
---
That's an interesting tidbit, thanks. We're unraveling the case!
---
Does crouching remove your name or the red hostile arrow hovering over your head?
---
If you completed some while in the BETA then you wont get them till they fix that. If not, then you're unlucky to hit another glitch. 
---
I was doing this and stopped. There always seems to be on guy that runs up to the cooler when it hits like 1000 weight or so and just grabs everything out of the cooler.
---
Funny how everything is dupers fault. Don't get me wrong they fucking suck but let's be honest the game is unstable with tons of things that could be the fault.
---
For most people, "releasing buggy games and charging $60" is the definition of suck. This shouldn't be a game of hide&amp;seek&amp;wait for consumers. If you release a game and charge $60 for it, it should be in playable condition, and shouldn't have basic design flaws like bobby pins that weigh 0.1 lbs each.

Do you work for Bethesda? Do you have any affiliation with Bethesda? Or are you just so young (I'm guessing 18, give or take 3 years) that you don't remember the time when companies released fully playable games?
---
Yeah, so still waiting on a source that says "about a year", because they said: "Hines cautioned that mods may not be supported in Fallout 76 until November 2019 at the soonest."
---
That means AT LEAST a year. Not, right around that time. It could even take 2 years, but the soonest would be after a whole year. With the current pace of fixing the most mediocre of bugs, and cat-and-mouse games with dupers/speed hackers/teleporters, I really doubt they'll be anywhere near that stage in 9 months. The game might have been worth the $60 if they had released at that point, and ironed everything out.
---
I hope to find a two shot instigating lever! Hopefully when I am a higher level. I try not to buy things on here, I love to find them “in the wild.” 
---
Thats motivation enough I guess plus im sure there are hundreds of people buying
---
No no! Still a drop my dude just “handmade” avoids any correlation to ak47 or any lore breaking stuff
---
Well the first thing I got was the cyan pip boy then the starlet sniper outfit and tuxedos. I just go for nice looking outfits. 
---
I'm level 135 and still get killed by level 50, at least if there are 3 of them ganging up on me and they all have 2 shot explosive weapons (which I have, but it sucks when you're not alone).
---
Regardless, I always dump junk before I PvP, and I log out when someone is attacking my base and I'm not around.
---
PvP is broken, especially with 2 shot explosive weapons.
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME THE FLATWOODS MONSTER GENDER!!!! 
---
Just give it some time.  I didn't listen to any of the Youtubers, or any reviews for that matter.  I enjoyed the game tremendously for a long time.  Eventually the server disconnects and freezes have gotten on my last nerve.  Now I only play with friends.  I enjoy the world and the lore immensely, so no hate coming from me, just wish it was more stable.  But, if you're enjoying it, that's all that matters
---
They don't want privately run servers because then mods cut into there atoms store purchases. 
---
NetImmerse / Gamebryo might have once been for MMO's but there have been significant changes between Oblivion/FO4 and Skyrim and more so in FO4 and the Skyrim SE side.  
---
The issues are absolutely related to the engine, it's been designed for single player client side modded games.  The netcode is from idtech (Quake/ Doom engine) and tacked on.  They would have been FAR better off retooling and going with idtech6.  Yes, more work up front, but a much more secure, performant better looking game.
---
There was not a "working, existing solution" as you hint at.  Look at the Skyrim together guys, they had to write an entire netcode implementation to make Skyrim multiplayer, not just use what was there, because there is nothing there, it was ripped out years ago.
---

Ok never-fucking-mind. Stick to your failed TSE build, it'll be useless when the fireproof update is out anyway.
---
Yeah I see so many people with them, but they’re such rare drops. Very disheartening. 
---
No, the yellow looks like '80s bumblebees. I want the paint job in the poster. Grey and black and red, it's sick!
---
I actually don't know how the ping was done, I have an IT/whitehat friend who did it for me from his home. I would guess he just trace routed where I was connected, I only have 76 using the web when i play to avoid client side connection issues, and he has a connection to my PC when I let him. Good to have him as a friend, Ive learned a ton off of him over the years.

Incisor is applied first and then once you have the total damage from incisor applied the extra from anti armor is applied.  
---
Yeah the radio towers on the map, you should see one just north of flatwoods south the vault 96 .. just walk in use the terminal and insert the gov. requisition and play the holo click request and bam, watch the map for drama in the next few mins lol

yea i have like 300 hours only found like 6 explosive weapons only one that was TSE and its my TSE lvl 50 western revolver
---
Because some of the people here are hella toxic man - just wanted to share something cool and my knowledge to help people out, but you always get the negs and keyboard warriors. Afaik that’s the correct way of calculating the weight :) thanks for your comment tho! Appreciate the decent responses
---
I am on xbox. I just did the nuke silo to finish the main questline. I am exploring and gathering supplies now to get stronger. I always appreciate company
---
' I am tired of spawning in ' is implying that this has happened to you often and at no point do you say ' I got disconnected in a safe place and than when I reconnect I am in a nuke zone ' and even if you did its still a series of unfortunate events . It's not like this is happening to you or anyone for that matter with regularity.  Especially the part where you add that you got looted too. As if there are people literally waiting for you to randomly log in, die to rads , just so they can loot you lol.
---
Now if we can just dragonrend these scorchbeasts down we'd be good

That's where I saw it once, too. Shot at it and it disappeared :(

My  fiance and I play together as much as possible. She is on night shift while I work day shift, so this is normally restricted to weekends but we get together and squeeze every ounce of fun we can out of the time we have.

Best story we have happened during beta. We were scouting out a subdivision (Cluster of houses might be more accurate) near Camden park. We found a guy out there with a bowie knife and nothing else looking to trade. Turns out he was a distraction for his sniper friend posted up nearby. While I was in the trading interface his buddy snipes my girl and he stabs me. She went down like a sack of potatoes, so I took every chem in my pack and went on a drug fueled killing spree. Ended up smearing both of those bastards into the a fine red paste. I guarded her bag while she sprinted back and both of the guys came back for a fight. Suffice it to say we fought over the area (and our loot) for a good hour before they shouted obscenities at us from the entrance to the neighborhood and fornicated in the opposite direction of our personages. We then happily took there sack lunches and carried on about our business. (I used the mats from their failed attempts to make my shotgun even more deadly. Totally worth the effort!)

Aw that is a bummer, even if pretty low-res and limited I think this would be so fun! There's so few ways to get to know a CAMP owner when you stumble across it. :(
---
Ok thanks for clearing that up for me! I usually ignore legendaries (which I've realised is stupid since starting 76, I think I did it because the little preview and effect you get when picking them up annoyed me but I also linked them with legendary armor which I throw away since I'm PA only) and my only one was Overseer's Guardian which is my main in Fallout 4.
---
I'm only level 21 but been using sledgehammer with rocket mod and skisword with metal shards since I got them
---
It does.  It crashes the server 😂
---
My encounter was different. He just stood there a bit away and let me missile him to death.
---
Getting 2-4 disconnects per play session, with dotted in straight up game crashes.  Not knowing if your game was gonna save progress each time.  The really bad part about losing progress is it had no problem remember the ammo and rss you use.

That you don't have to pull the handle on the water pump or push the button on a drinking fountain just to get dirty water to boil, but can instead gather dirty water *much* more quickly by simply finding a puddle or pool or stream or (non-drinking, ornamental) fountain and spamming the action key.
---
I have an anti armor VATS and it does less than half, you read that right, less than half during a crit as my 2 shot VATS.  I can't even explain how that could possibly be, but it is.

I did not consent

Maybe you should read up more about the economics of this game because you know very little and resort to trash talking ignorance?

Lived in Southeastern Ohio and West Virginia most my life, and can confirm this. If we're talking old houses, there was sort of a stereotypical Victorian style home that was super popular with builders in the late 1800s early 1900s. You can walk into any of these houses and immediately identify them if their kitchens have original cabinets and counters. They were really popular with families of miners, steel workers, and other laborers.

The one thing I wish they'd put in is the West Virginia state flower: a rusted out, old fashioned satellite dish. :P

My wife and I play she is lol 71 IAm lol 74. We love working together. Some times a buddy of mine will join us and we explore.
---
This is what I've been suffering on PC since the patch last week. There have been a few threads on it but none from XBox users afaik.
---
It's mind blowingly frustrating and makes me question why I'm playing this game at all.
---
I loved your comeback.  Epic and in universe.  I’m gonna use it next time.  
---
Most of the high level monsters seem to be balanced around the player being OP by level 50. With the right perks and an OP legendary (eg TSE pump shotgun), you can down one in about 5 trigger pulls. And even less if all your pellets hit.
---
I think its shit for brains balance, but that's how it is. The loot tables, durability, and bullet spongyness of mobs is absolutely completely and utterly out of whack. Even the queen is too much of a sponge at level 90 +, unless the entire server is blasting and her with TSEs, and her health doesn't glitch back up to 100%.
---
I got a swarm of eyebots yesterday with a major gutsy as the "boss"(the one that spawns at the lockers)
---
Most excellent work dude, I have only seen this cryptid once at the high ropes course by the bridge, took one shot at him with a Gauss and he vanished, does he drop any unique loot, or is it just the same old RNG junk?
---
im pretty sure the "shred of proof" is the flooded market filled with duplicated items that seems to be never-ending.
---
all it takes is one person to do a lot of duping then spread the items out. not everyone has to know how it is done specifically.
---
Just look at neemy carry capacity after you take everything. Definitely personal stuff they use is hidden.
---
Wow this beats hopping to farm lead. Thanks!
---
Sharing my 3 star Rad sponge gets bugged sometimes and doesn't share it correctly.  I have to manually share it over an over again for it to remove rad damage and show the animation it works.
---
Not sure if you are joking but XBOX has built in Party chat and text chat that is far more reliable than in-game chat. I rarely play without it since the game constantly crashes
---
On the flip side, there are people like myself that often invite multiple random people from all over the map with the best of intentions. the more people in the party the better, free travel locations, shared perks and extra bonuses with perk cards per ppl in team - not every random invite is malicious :)
---
False Advertisment, mainly and a broken release.
---
But lately it is only hate and youtubers want to butcher it for clicks and money. Like the whole thing around Nuka Dark Rum which has almost nothing to do with Bethesda and the Game and is only sold by an subcontractor.
---
Or Jim Sterling saying the Nuke Bug to new year was the worst that can happen or what he said "there is basically nothing else to do as throwing nukes" despite the fact that you can do a lot besides nuking stuff and killing the queen.
---
Or CleanGamingPrince fabricating a story that he started to play again to find something good in the game and encountered player one shooting stuff with low level weapons (despite the fact not knowing what level other people gear has because there is no inspect feature). And saying "unbelieveable that there are exploiters and glitchers in an online game and people selling virtual goods".
---
Or DreamcastGuy reporting on the hidden Devroom and saying that the NPC is a hint on NPCs in future releases of the game despite the fact that the game has NPCs.
---
Seriously. At this point it gets stupid.
---
I've heard this about "beta" characters, but truth is, it's not just a character created in the beta.  I didn't play until a few weeks after launch.  I'm missing the level 100 achievement (level 146) and several of these challenges that I've tried to complete multiple times.
---
That sounds pretty good! 
---
I like hearing about different combinations of perks that work well together. 
---
I had to shovel a bunch of points into agility and strength for my rifle/unarmed build so I didnt have enough room for much END. 
---
Ended up turning to mutations to pretty much do what you're doing. 
---
Healing factor for the healing in between fights and carnivore for the food healing since i always keep glowing meat and ionized meat on me. 
---
for rads I use sunkissed and I have a decontamination shower at my camp. 
---
For healing in combat I will sometimes run ghoulish. especially in Nuke zones since my friend will share rad sponge and the constant radiation keeps me healing. 
---
It does not. The only thing to prevent that is distance. Sniping is the best way around that. 
---
No end game like a good pvp system or dungeons or really anything hard
---
Ive replayed FO4 numerous times.   Great game!
---
Yeah let us know how you feel in a month
---
Whitesprings and West tec agricultural centre are some good places for legendaries from what I've heard.
---
Does the fireproof perk help with frag and plasma damage, or just fire?
---
DROPPED LIKE A SACK OF POTATOES. This story was wild from start to finish!! Never had anything like that, but you guys fight hard for each other that right there is great.

I reckon their dying act is to put their excess ammo where you won't look.

Now how that super mutant fit that fat man up there, I don't know.

Your player oven is epic.  If I had stumbled across it and got roasted, I would have sent you a virtual high five.  I would be honored to be roasted in there sometime.  I hope someday I see your camp.
---
Oh yeah, I do remember doing that. It gave you like 50 or 100 days more to complete the quest. I even forgot about the time limit to finish the main story. So we’re caps the main currency in fo1? I honestly remember them being like a gold coin looking thing.
---
Seems like only one other person in this thread knows this but you can repair the base without using any materials. All you need is caps. Replace your CAMP and then go to stored and place down your items it blueprinted for you. 
---
It also helps to have your main structure built off of one foundation. 
---
 But why? They are just playing the part of Raiders. I don't see why this is such a big deal? I never accept friend requests from people I don't know, it's naive to accept them...
---
Group of friends and I do Tax collecting and duper hunting all the time, it's hilarious. We roll up with a squad of like 12 people or so if we suspect they are duping, we announce "Open up Duping police, here for inspection." if they don't open up we blow the door off the hinges, if they appear to be duping we take down their whole base. One time we scared the shit out of one guy and he left us a nice large bag filled with materials and weapons. If we are just in it for pvp we Announce " Open up, tax collectors. Your tribute is due." If they refuse tribute we take down their base and slaughter them. I LOVE PVP!
---
A raider set spawns in a little arena in the ski resort. It’s not usually a full set but it does have pieces occasionally. 
---
I quit after about a year, and it was pretty much a ghost town at the time, at least on PC. Finding a group for the raids, whatever they were called, was a pain.
---
Thing is, the first 3 months or so in The Division, the devs were just patching holes, and ignoring the issues with the base game. BUT not banning players for it. So people who exploited, and farmed a bunch of stuff (including maxing out division tech via exploits very quickly) got to keep all of their stuff. That was their mistake. Other companies typically band AND fix simultaneously. Or at the very least roll back and fix. As in, find offending accounts, and roll them back. And this was relatively easy to do - when a person is running around with 20k grenades in their inventory, it's pretty clear he didn't get them legitimately. Remember how every server had 2-3 people just sitting there disarming those traps, pretty much 24/7? Nothing happened to them. That was Bethesda's and Massive's mistake. Blizzard and others would have banned the absolute shit out of them, or rolled back their accounts, like they did in Diablo 3. Blizz doesn't catch everyone, and not immediately, but they don't let these things get endemic within the game. 
---
Sadly Bethesda went and did just that. They allowed it to spread, and they allowed people to profit from it (both in game and with RMT). And yes, at this point it's hard to ban, because they would have to ban a large portion of the game's population. But they could have stopped it in its tracks when it first started -  a few hundred strategic bans would very quickly get the message across that if you exploit, you won't be allowed to profit from it - you'll get a roll back and lose it all (even legit progress) or you'll get banned outright and that's that. 
---
And that's really the problem with what Bethesda is doing. Yes, they may have patched one dupe exploit. Guess what? Another one is already up! They cannot win this race. They have to get rid of *dupers*, not just the dupes. As long as cheaters and exploiters are in the game, especially in large numbers, Bethesda has ZERO chance of maintaining law and order and enforcing TOS. 
---
Happened to me.  If you're spawning at Whitesprings to kill some legendaries,  it can happen. 
---
I got a request from a stranger when I was around level 150, long long time ago; I accepted, it was two British kids around level 15, needing to get to level 21 for some reason? Some perk or something they wanted. Their cursing in their accents was delightful, this was back before there were any XP nerfs, so we had a blast killing the level 68 scorched and super mutants that spawned because of me. I felt responsible for them and managed to keep them alive the entire time. Took about an hour or two to get them up the 6 levels. Alas, the good old days. I hate that I’ve gotten burned out. I got near level 250 and was putting in so many hours every day, had no missions left and was starting to get really irritable with people and things that never bothered me before. So I’ve taken the last two or three weeks off and just done red dead. I’ll probably rejoin the wasteland after the console patch tomorrow to see if I can recapture some of the magic. 
---
I disagree, She deserves a bullet in her brain from me.
---
Who are the moderators of this fine establishment? Give this fine man a flair!
---
Just double checked for you and that is a NEGATIVE. Only black titanium, leather, and ultracite in the mods I have on me and stored.
---
Patch fixed the bug that recharged fusion cores.  So yea we all are going through them now like we were suppose to.  It was nice while it lasted though
---
I've never seen anyone hit these problems while not playing during BETA, not saying you're lying or anything. Maybe you should report that to BGS then because if that's a normal thing then that needs to raise the priority of fixing this. 
---
That's not proof of a "new duping" method
---
supply drops cause bounties?
---
What's wrong with that? I have always around 8k ultracite .50 ammo on me
---
Never duped or used another shitty exploit
---
Ok bud
---
What level are you? My budget would be crushed by all that 
---
Glad you've enjoyed your first few hours of playing, I think most of us have, including myself. But over time, that can quickly sour. You'e in the honeymoon phase, and that's a good stage to be in. A lot of us had and still have to deal with very frequent disconnects. Disconnects? Yeah, disconnects. Initially due to poor calculations of how many players their docker containers could handle, then exacerbated by the easy exploitation of a poorly programmed multiplayer. A single player carrying too many items, crafting too quickly, or duplicating items can crash an entire server instance. And it has. My final straw was 4 disconnects in a row, after moving near where other players were. Most likely they were duping, because I would get frequent "Not responding" in their vicinity.
---
I had big hopes for this game, but given the slow reparations of the existing issues (and straight up nasty, hacky patching of 21:9 support, where the right side of the screen isn't accessible with a mouse in menus) and lack of endgame content, PvP riddled with cheaters that one-hit everything.
---
I really want to agree that we should feel sorry for Bethesda, and I gave them an $80 benefit (which didn't even unlock much of anything) of the doubt 2 months ago, but I don't. From the marketing bullshit, poor customer service, shitty launcher that re-downloaded the game twice to releasing an alpha game with an overpriced cash shop, I don't feel sorry. They've deserved the YouTube hate, and they've deserved the low price the game is at. I feel sorry for the players that supported them at full price or over, and got shafted with easily the worst Fallout in the entire franchise.
---
Duper exploits regulations to cheaply manufacture high-quality merchandise and sells it for pennies on the dollar, at the expense of those who scavenge through the dirt trying to find their dream gun.  The only way this could better reflect capitalism is if the dupers claimed that the scroungers simply weren't scrounging hard enough.
---
&lt;3
---
Ok buddy 
---
He glitched so couldn't pick up anything off him but according to other redditors on here it's drops are pretty rubbish with scorch giving better loot
---
already reported the level 100 achievement.  Response was, start another character.... yeah.. not gonna happen.
---
Just press the share button and press video clip. It'll save the last 15 minutes of game play. Alternatively, you can press the share button twice and it will start recording. It's a handy feature.
---
It's a great game, especially with lots of mods and playing fallout 76 certainly makes me want to play it again.
---
That's exactly where I am setup also. I built a shotgun style house basically, with an upper deck inside the U.
---
lol
---
Why about an assultron head? Not sure if they have lead, but I know they need to be scrapped manually. Go get some more lead and see if that resolves it.
---
"Arguably" doesn't mean people are arguing about it; it means an argument can be made either way. Objectively, you are correct that destroying someone's buildings is PvP. Subjectively, the other person is correct that destroying buildings is griefing. These are not mutually exclusive. And arguably, if you do something that is subjectively griefing and are aware that many people consider it griefing, you *are* griefing, regardless of your own opinion on it.
---
A level 7 kid walked up with a hammer and smacked the vendor twice. Turning him into a scrap pile on the ground. He did while yelling "die die". Couldn't be no more than eight years old. 
---
It's really unplayable for me at the moment, I've tryed lowering resolution, turning off hdr ect... but then I think to my self why should i this game should run fine
---
Ha. I did that too. I tracked down a wanted player and figured out where they were headed so I cut them off. They stood there while I went to hit them and got the prompt that I had pacifist mode on. They took off and after another minute or two I caught back up to them, this time with pacifist off, and took them out quickly. I tried to loot the body but it fell into a creek and then three freaking scorchbeasts spawned and I had to nope the heck out of there.
---
Nobodies catching the drift though, this game is so badly done that every patch produces a new dupe (if it even exists) like there’s no hardcore evidence. Bethesda are living in 2008 still with their shit engine and hoping people feed off their micro-transactions. It’s a poor excuse for a AAA, there’s indie companies out their that put more effort into a stable release. 
---
Ok so just throwing this out there.... But isn't this the point of FO76? We are all playing the roles we play. This sounds like classic Raider behavior. 
---
I enjoy the story OP and don't think you shouldn't have shared but all the calls for reporting these players feels.. wrong. 
---
I think the more appropriate move would be to post here or hit your friends up and squad up quick to clean up the raiders. I know we cant share other players names but couldn't you hop on here, request backup, and then go hunting? 
---
It just feels like this is a mechanic of the game - role playing. These dudes we're being asshole Raiders, you just needed to assemble your own version if the minutemen and take it to em! 
---
I'd imagine that sometimes its people that are bored. We could definitely use some more content then white-springs and scorch queen on loop. Doesn't sound like the PUBG pvp mode is going to help much either, but who knows. Maybe the new vaults will be interesting too.
---
that sounds so right it has to be what they are doing, but how to cause a rollback, it's not like they can just tell the server to forget the last 5 minutes unless they figured a way to track when the servers "save" progress and time it just right.
---
Bet the Scorchbeasts would even nope away from that zone, lol.
---
I almost daily start my playtime with this quest. Free fusion cores and BoS gear ftw. And the event spawns when a player goes near it, so its easy to trigger it.
---
As others have said, Ive never had more than 3 scorchbeasts even with up to 5 people at the event. The amount of scorched spawned with the waves seems to scale with the amount of people.
---
All I can think is that someone before you started the event, spawned a scorchbeast and than dc'd for whatever reason and the scorchbeast didnt despawn before you restarted the event and spawned another scorchbeast.
---
And yea you can shut the sonic emitter off after you repair it, just keep an eye on the clock/event timer. If the emitter gets destroyed you wont have the audible cue that it stopped sqawking and you only have 1 min ish to repair the sonic generator or the event fails. There is a timer that shows up under the event timer that says repair sonic emitter (x time left to repair)
---
I just wish they had the poses as emotes
---
Don’t need to glitch in to know there’s a G.E.C.K. Check audio files in Harper’s ferry.
---
The vault is also unfinished.  There are even placeholder terminal entries. One of the placeholders literally says:
---

---
“To be written”
---
The dumping of legendaries is tight - I've found a few items that kept me going for the day. Although it's great, I do wish we could scrap them. These mass dumps of legendaries i've seen around the world (I believe) causes more server instability. Unless tracking multiple individual mats from scrap is more taxing. This goes for ammo/fusion cores/various armor ofc. Idk man, there are too many legendaries/ammo and misc things floating around the world that people can't scrap/use for themselves. 
---
Dude you could just left it at "that is the correct way to do it" instead of this whole whiny crybaby super defensive circle jerk. I hope you aren't always right no matter fucking what with your poor wife too.
---
yeah thats what i did, but "wouldn't it be nice" if people weren't toxic and salty?
---
Just out of curiosity, why didn't you put Adrenaline on there?
---
Appreciate that.
---
it's at least a shred since items are continuously being duped even after the previous ones are fixed. that is literally the only logical conclusion you can make. 
---
but hey, if you want to keep your head firmly planted up your ass, be my guest.
---
So you are the *fence* of the gang. Do you also have a *straight man* to send your victims to your shop, so that you can sell them back the stuff they were robbed at thrice the price 
---
;) /s. 
---
I might be interested in this down the line. My current character is a bit of a loner, but I've been considering making a new one, better suited to team play.
---
I don't even bother with workshops. Fortune finder and caps collector. Sell gear and weapons I don't want on reddit. Keep a fat cap stack just to buy bulk from vendors so I don't have to deal with the heartbreak of claimin a work shop to dc right after I set it up. Lol. 
---
PSO was my shit! Could never really play on dialup but even offline that game was amazing. I must've played over 200 hours easily. 
---
I have noticed the item the scorched was using against you on the ground next to, or near by, the scorched corpse. It's like  they dropped in on the ground (and out of their inventory) upon death.
---
oof no bobblehead fix yet? This is getting horrific.
---
And then everyone will go back to melee builds and one-shot each other that way.
---

You can find always one just close to Charleston Station, between it and the nearby Power Plant, lvl 10 though but gives the same mats as the high level ones.
---
Roams around the waters and sometimes fights some liberators.

Yeah, they do. The global economy for this game is on a Venezuelan level.

Yeah and you will get annihalated over and over and over because now, suddenly, pvp required skill.

Does not go away until another player kills you. Server hopping does nothing, dying by NPC does nothing. I usually fast travel to Vault 76, disrobe, and sit on the ground and wait for someone to show up and kill me.
---
He does not realize it because he hasn't truly built a camp and had it destroyed by a juvenile. Fortunately I just store the most valuable items like the decon shower and only place it when I need to use it. 
---
Yeah idk, I’ve attempted a similar build. Chameleon was working quite nicely PvE but apparently not against other players. 
---
I’m about to give up and just go full demo/rifle
---
Yes a great fallout tip. Been using it for years on console.

#FreeWooby

I’ll agree with you there, but there’s one NPC that’s human named Wooby. I can’t remember if you can talk to him but that’s all I can remember. Maybe this is hope for further DLC with human and other NPC. I’m hoping for human like Deathclaw because I remember the lore that deathclaws slowly but surely became intelligent and self aware. Plus it’s really rare to find I thinks it’s only in the Mire or Cranberry bog there’s a Deathclaw Traveling Merchant. I’ve only seen a video and it was a dead body but I think this is a confirmed creature. End of this month boys and maybe our questions and theories will be solved
---
That's an awful lot of extremely rare ammo you have there sir. 
---
I've killed 5 or 6 with miniguns in the last week and they never drop them for me XD. Could be a level thing, I'm only level 37
---
 (•\_•) . . . Acting like you have a seriously good weapon? and trying to have barging rights? HUNTING RIFLES ARE TRASH on any build... So you have a virtually unasked for product that will only be valued by a small % of the player base? what kind of value is that worth? it would only hold any inherent value if massed produced. You have 1? dupers manufacture the same product, same stat, and all. Making it more open to the free market and making it more fun for players. So I ask you what value does your 1 single weapon have? 0 because unless its duped it wont have any  a hunting rifle  trash to everyone! except like 5 people. . . Economics  (⌐■\_■)

I thought Hardened was the highest mod for protection, but yesterday I scrapped some spare marine armor and I got the Buttressed mod for the chest, which is higher than hardened. I never knew about it so I started my quest to scrap all the arms and legs to get it on them. Just a heads up since I’ve never seen anything about buttressed until I got it lol 
---
Best answer so far.  I'm gonna uninstall reshade just for a little while anyways though while I'm waiting for a Bethesda response.  If I don't hear from them at all I'll probably use it again.  So far I've put in a support ticket online and called and left a voicemail to Zenimax customer service (they only take voicemails and callback).  We'll see if anyone responds.
---
Well, to be fair, your original post makes it sound like it's happening to you all the time. Which would mean you are spending a lot of time in Whitesprings. 
---
last night, Jan 13, I had the same thing happen 3 servers in a row, step one game locks up, no server notice of not responding: step 2 either complete CTD for the 1st and 3rd, 2nd only dropped me to the launch menu but wouldn't let me log in at all and had to reboot the game anyway. Didn't think to check my inventory as I was only scrapping and bulking items in my camp.
---
When will I get this quest? Where do I need to be mate?
---
Awesome! Thanks for that!
---
Need PvP and PvE servers already.
---
Ive scrapped so much and never got a mod. I dont even believe it works lol
---
It's a great choice, to be honest, and I'm going to say this is poor planning on my part.
---
Replace any agility point with one point of Adrenaline. I'll see if I can update the guide (not sure, as that site is weird about changing perks). I'd probably dump white knight - your thoughts?
---
I had to drop the remaining technical data then pick it up again for the quest to re-trigger. Hope that helps.
---
U want the demolition perk under INT. 
---
Like this one?

Posted to this sub today
---
I was 35 or so... But I was defending the Ammo Factory workshop. Imagine my face when instead of something like '1/3 Mole Rat Waves' it just says '0/1 Scorchbeast Slain'.
---
I threw turrets EVERYWHERE.
---
You fool!  He was sealed for a reason! :0
---
I actually like this event. 
---
I did it once by myself and hated it.
---
But ever since then, If I see someone else doing it, I jump in and help. And it usually goes very well.  I really like doing it in a team, and its a blast.
---
but yeah, doing it Solo sucks.
---
It really isn’t man, you can buy anything on market76 for dirt cheap!!! Or, buy the crafting mats and make it yourself too :D!
---
I actually encountered one while I was fighting scorch beast down south by prime. 
---
I was taking refuge in the shed that is the exit elevator for the mine. The beast stopped its bombardment on me and was attacking something else, it was getting lit up purple.. At that moment I see the alien cruise by the doorway, shooting at the scorch beast. Not trying to miss my opportunity to get a shot in for the xp,I lay a couple rounds into it. it turned back around and started shooting at me.. Now.. This was the 3rd time I've run into this alien. This was the 1at 2 times it immediately teleports away as soon as it hit caution or its hit once . Not only that but the Lil fucker hurt. In lvl 50 x01 power armor. He was chunking me. And I have energy resist up there (mutations) took a couple swing of my executioner super sledge to dispatch it. 600 xp and alot of rare mats. No gun. I recorded the clip on Xbox I will see if I can upload it somehow
---
Nah I was like that German dude.
---
Brill. Thanks buddy. The ones next to "top of the world"?
---
Lining it up properly and getting the @#$/^&amp; floor down took up 95% of my time.
---
This is a CAMP where OCD is a bloody awesome Perk!
---
That is the golden goose right there.
---
When I was lower level had luck with the spawn point under the bridge near the ice cream shop.  Prob won't get a full set, tends to only have 2-3 pieces at a time.  If the door is locked, the key is on a body on the rollercoaster at the amusement park.
---
Karma system, yes.  Real life implications on a game, wtf no?
---
Could be he has lots of (possibly duped) TSE weapons but no duped components. He could be crafting armor to scrap to learn mods only learnable by scrapping.
---
I usually finish up with about 2500. It last me a week and a half.
---
Lvl 28 here.  Usually on in the evenings EST when I play.
---
Aha yeah its probably gonna take like 100’s to get all the mods. I thought I had all of them except buttressed but then I barely got the lighter build for my arms today, and that was after scrapping 50 or so arms and legs :(
---
I messed up a guys Base because he was Singing Celine Dion songs -\_\_\_\_-
---
Has someone confirmed there even is one in 76? The one I saw reported on recently was definitely in Fallout 4.
---
If I can't activate a "plan" or "recipe" that I have in my inventory, does that mean I already have it and I can just get rid of them?
---
No it's really not. People were duping tens of thousands of each item I'd be shocked if they didn't still have them a whopping 1 day later
---
That’s the one. It’s next door to the big ski lodge with the truck &amp; camper parked out the front. 
---
I know about that one was just wondering if this one worked too.
---
1) Caps: So you abuse a flawed wanted system, you arent making this better and dont say its a feature to kill teammates in order to get out of being wanted and get caps
---
2) PvP Battles: I know what you guys do, and you will probably never get a fair pvp fight. Higher level players will be a very large challenge for you and possibly result in your loss of junk.Instead you destroy the bases of low level players who cannot defend themselves.
---
3) Junk: Unless you are able to scrap items in another player's base, there is no way to get junk from destroying a player's base. Maybe food and water but definitely not junk.
---
4) Getting better at  PvP: there are games that are a lot better than Fallout to get better at PvP. Playing shoot em up on buildings wont make you better at PvP, but better at pointing a gun and hitting anywhere on the wall. There are *Hundreds* of games that do a better job .
---
5) Raider role play :If you think this is raider role play, you and your gang are the stupidest fucking raiders, and the raiders in Fallout 4 are pretty dumb.  Raiders in Fallout go after guaranteed loot by attacking and controlling valuable  settlements and  ransoming valuable items. All you are doing is wasting your own bullets and  making people less likely to help you. 
---
6) Big Fights: We have 2 situations. first is with any group the same level or less, who will probably wait for the attack to be over or server hop. Second are the people that are higher level than you who will simply kill you and take your shit. There is nothing to gain.'
---
Bottom Line: Yes, Bethesda allows you to destroy bases, but there is nothing to gain out of it.  I dont hate Bethesda for it, but instead despise those who abuse a broke system in order to make someone's day worse and get a  laugh out of it. 
---
The overworld pvp in this game is so odd. Like its not much of a threat, since its like 1 material each to repair your base and since you can easily deposit junk before going on long treks across the world. Its more-so just an annoyance if you do not want to pvp or have your base messed up. I feel like I'd rather it be an actual threat then an annoyance since its a survival game but I know my opinion will not be the popular one. In a survival game I kind of want to be looking over my shoulder and wondering if that guy running around near me is a threat or a friendly. That feeling isn't there though, when the other player has to hit you back to start a fight. I don't know, maybe its just me.   
---
This game could really use an "aggressive" option in options as well that makes you able to openly initiate pvp with other players with aggressive on at any time without the whole shoot me back thing. When you have aggressive on it puts a skull over your head on the map or something. If players could easily find who is up for pvp battles when they present their-selves, then the trolling would not be nearly as bad. Currently players can not really tell who is open to pvp so they just run around bothering people until they participate.
---
Probably so far down or off the map that it doesnt load in and all that I'd stuff you said 
---
You most likely don't have the required perk card equipped for the level of Armor you are trying to build.
---
I've noticed if I'm looking at some popple in chameleon, they have the invisible "shimmer" so they're hard to see, but then it puts their username/level over their head in bright yellow. So then they're easy to pick out.
---
It doesn't do this all the time though. Maybe just if you're aiming at them? Haven't tested enough to confirm when it shows the username, but I picked out a guy in chameleon on the roof of whitesprings because of this.
---
Put them in your stash, then take one out, it should reset/recognise your carrying again.  Worked for me.
---
That's mister sister lol
---
K
---
Yeah im sorta in a predicament right now bc my base was raided for a second time now.... for what ever reason bc they get nothing out of it besides trolling. The idiot destroyed everything inside and then logged when i went to collect the bounty. But yeah i decided to move the base,  and now cant place it back down even on flat ground and its a 1x1.
---
My theory is the old "Camel is a horse designed by  committee". I think one person alone can create somehow cool and share it according to their own vision. In a company, I imagine it's more some guy creates something, then his boss decided that it doesn't really "feel" presidential, or whatever, other people put feedback in or gwt involved, and you end up with something generic and boring that everyone sorta thinks is Okay, but they're just happy that one thing is finished now so don't care anymore.
---
YongYea have video on it, and there are muskets and so on, which are missing in FO4, and also chests have Weight limits xxxx/0 which is also indication it is indeed fotage from FO76.
---
Are they hostile on approach? I've encountered 3 of them and they didn't  attack first. 
---
I believe so with the PC patch that happened last week. They are no longer reset to 100% if you log out while in your power armor.
---
Dansgaming is a popular twitch streamer that has a good playlist for Fallout 76

---
It is in the current patch, active for PC already, on consoles tomorrow.
---
yup
---
I am expressing interest
---
You see FO76 uses the Schrödinger's loot system
---
and by actually looting any inventory you collapse  its very function. 
---
Ever since I trigger the quest I only ever have one technical data, no matter how many I pick up. My friend who doesn't have the quest can carry a stack and hand them to me one at a time though. A bug? Who knows. I'm gonna try the stash box thing as the other comment says and see if that fixes it.
---
Dude, sorry to see so many hate on you for stating the obvious, they didn't take into account that ARK lets people run their own server, if BGS decides to go pay per use servers they can prevent players from creating a server by just not letting the code out to run one.
---
Man, I've been trying to kick that stuff for awhile.
---
Thanks for the response. Don't understand the downvotes, though. Whatever.

The lighthouse. Each model lighthouse is two copper and there are a bunch there. Also right behind Whitesprings station there are a few copper nodes. Make sure to use your excavator for Max yield.
---
Ah, too many chefs problem, perhaps.
---
Bethesda should just scour over Nexusmods, pick the top downloaded mod author from each category and pay them a salary. We would have the best game ever here!
---
But would not it crashed server by default if someone access it with server full of ppl? There is no issue so far filling server with players. So the one who recorded video had his stash and CAMP active as everyone else in the world.
---
But nice thought about it. 
---
Is there? I've only wandered across there once, in the dark, and despite seeing the chest across the water, I decided to go with my first instinct which was "NOPE."
---
Gta online is much worse
---
Its most likely in a test cell that doesn't actually load with the normal world map.
---
You cannot learn to make armor pieces themselves from scrapping, only mods. Except helmets you can learn to make the whole helmet (Marine Armor, Combat Armor, Metal, and the various Robot ones) from scrapping.
---
I've scrapped thousands of armor pieces, and have leaned every mod that can only be learned by scrapping that can be learned. In all that time, I've never unlocked being able to craft an armor piece. Only plans do that.
---
Kevduit made a few really funny ones but I think he quit the game already 
---
bought the game after the beta on pc, and still have issues with some challenge.
---
Even created an alt just to check if t was gonna fill the discover locales challenge after the latest patch(10 january) and it didn't change anything.
---
The last patch corrected some of them but the perk challenge, food recipes and discover locales are still not working.
---
Same here multiple characters with the latest being at level 99 no explosive nothing as legendary most I’ve have with me is a 3 star level 25 armor that reduces weapon weight 20% ( I’m assuming all weapons )
---
Well just like fo4 the room caused no issues to performance so how ever they code it could be very well put together to keep the items form messing with the servers 
---
Now we just need one to make whiskey...
---
Only lunatics who think that gunpowder will somehow tie the whole conconction together. Hah, how I laugh at these fools.
---
...Yes, I know what arguably means. Which is why I pointed at that people are arguing about it.
---
It doesn't matter if someone thinks nonconsensual PvP is griefing, it's not. Even if the aggressor knows the other person thinks nonconsensual PvP is griefing, it still isn't griefing. By your logic, you're griefing me right now so long as I say it's griefing. Does that make sense?
---
pretty much never
---
Because they are using an exploit to have more carry weight than intended. 
---
You're welcome sir. And o feel like this sub-reddit became something where any negatives get downvoted, and all respect of unaware people disapeared. Which is a shame. But you should never back off your feelings and comments. 
---
We certainly need to get more out of scrapping weapons and armor.
---
If it takes screws and springs to make, give us screws and springs when scrapped!
---
Sneak? Work with higher level players? Get better gear? Play during times that have fewer players online? Server hop?
---
I don't bother with the bug, but the 200 carry weight is the reason. Some people just can't stop themselves from hoarding.
---
No, whoever said that was bullshitting you. You can't do that whatsoever. 
---
...Life is odd there...
---
It's a high level area to begin with. 
---
I think your friend is pulling an E P I C  prank 
---
Nah, this is just an excuse for people to troll. 
---
Lol I will concede this point to you. But they did not truly think this through. 
---
There aren't ways to easily identify who is a raider and who is not when in the wasteland you can easily tell by just their clothes, face tattoos and other markings. 
---
There aren't game mechanics that allow players who identify as raiders to be attacked without a bounty if they haven't attacked first when in the real wasteland you could.
---
It's amusing to see your lame justifications for harassing other players. You don't realize what you are doing is wrong. If you do realize it then we would like the opportunity for wasteland justice.
---
This is about the nicest response to this comment I could imagine. 
---
Dude if you really wanted an answer that didn't fit your narrative, you'd ask this in r/fallout
---
It isn't accessible by any normal in-game means which likely means it isn't constantly loaded.
---
On top of that, one location with a fuckload of items is different than 24 different locations with a fuckload of items (players).
---
Not real life implications, I meant that in real life, being a raider has consequences but games lack that because there is no permanence.  I mean what if you had a long term negative consequence in game if you are caught. I mean if you murder someone in real life, you go to jail. In fallout it’s like the Wild West, so frontier justice but since we won’t actually imprison players, there should be some type of annoying justice that makes their be a consequence for choosing that type of lifestyle in game. 
---
I agree with what everyone else has already said. I seriously wonder how old you are, as this type of post strikes me as something a younger person might post. 
---
As someone that's played since beta it really wasn't that bad to begin with, there were just a lot of "annoyances" and the not so occasional "Blue screen crash during nukes". Aside from that it was more-so tweaks that the game needed to be more enjoyable as far as quality of life went and duping bugs that needed to be patched. The game has never been flat out unplayable like a lot of these reviewers were pitching.
---
Hard to tell, but it feels odd that this is there and stash argument was stability. Maybe you are right though. 
---
I dont think that's her final audio log anyways. Considering if you launch a nuke at anything that isn't a fissure site, a new holotape appears at each missile silo berating you for it.
---
I really enjoy Oxhorn video about Fallout 76 
---
Get that furry shit outta here!
---
Thus is a scaley household! &gt;:0
---
I put mine in the golf bag on top of the golf cart by the golf club. Since people tend to stand around that platform to the side of the building they pass by it frequently. 
---
At all locations there is a chance. I had servers with no legendary at any of these locations. But also server with 10 or more on my route. Rng is sometimes insane... &lt;.&lt;
---
If you don´t find a legendary, change server and try again. No reason to stay on a server with no legendaries. But if you find a good server, stay and go from location to location where you have seen legendaries. They will be there at every respawn.
---
I feel like at 40 you shouldn't really have too much trouble with level 50 protectrons.
---
Stash your junk and don't give up. I tackled Watoga in my early 30s and fought what I could and tried my best to get in and get out quick.
---
I normally only accept invites from low lvl people or even messages over live since they go out of their way to do so.  
---
Thanks a lot dude. Glad to hear =)
---
 I'm on PC but this is a game I will not play. ;)
---
No furry gang allowed 
---
I completely agree. You used to be able to use the perk cards to get better components when you scrap. This deffo needs to be a thing in 76. Springs are the Bain of my life at the moment. 
---
As i responded to another user
---
Itll always been an argument I think 800lb would be the right amount but can only hope 
---
I am not an intelligent man nor do I have the ability to read (someone else is typing &amp; reading this for me), but from what I gather you are saying is...we need to stop whatever we are doing and start duping. We need to dupe our way to victory, where as if we all do it, we all win. :D 
---
We have to be better than the communists are at duping to win. We have to do it better, faster, and cheaper than the competition, damn communists. So this is a call to action, if you are just sitting around farming or questing, quit it. WE NEED YOU!
---
#/S
---
^^^Don't dupe, this is just a nonsense post. Duping is for losers. 
---
There is no exploit about it.  Excavator gives +100 carry, period.  
---
Why would you call it an exploit?
---
Not to mention asshole who could straight one shot you. Even aboard the main ship area. I was just thinking about FO76's comparisons to PSO earlier today. I remember logging in one time and two guys were standing right by the teleported. Killed me instantly. I had 6 of those dolls that revive you. (Whatever they were called.) And I used up 5 of them before I could log off quick enough.
---
Cause literally just stimpacking ALL damage a ranged user can do and running upto and one-tapping them is so very hard. 
---
I've gone and shot at a melee user in ultracite power armor, they lost maybe 15% health between me and my turrets at a workshop he was trying to take before he closed the gap and one-shot me cause he just kept stimpacking as he charged. Granted, this was also when I had the 3 commando perks and using Perfect Storm, but it still shows melee needs nothing but stimpacks to kill all but the TSE weapons. 
---
"BUT IT'S MORE SKILLED TO SPAM A HOTKEY AND CLICK M1 INSTEAD OF AIMING AND SHOOTING!"
---
PvP will only require skill when Melee loses it's ridiculous incisor perk and PA can't just constantly inject stimpacks, until then, there is no skill in PvP.
---
*Stubs toe on coffee table*
---
**FUCKING DUPERS!!**
---
Screw that I just want a horse!
---
But yeah dragonrend would be nice for the melee people.
---
didn't know you can get banned for beta testing the game. that's good to know
---
Can you explain where this "new duping method" is coming from? yesterday night i checked and was so happy that no duping method anywhere and today everyone is saying shit like "servers are crashing because of dupers" and "dupers are crashing the servers if you dont believe me i dont care" where the fuck is this info coming from? Any proof?
---
I've been using Nerd Rage+Adrenaline in conjunction with Unyeilding armor and it's been a blast. With the full set, you become a beast but you will have to keep your health pretty low. With all of the +3 stats it has, you will be able to be a beast. 
---
Oh snap
---
Whar be this fine pirate's booty...?
---
uh...***Argh***.
---
And, um, I'm just asking for a friend.
---
It gives you +100 for full set, then +100 for calibrated shocks, and then after that there is an exploit that gives you an additional +100 allowing you to have 500-600lbs on you.
---
yea I figured just havent had the need to find out yet.
---
When I got the quest I was only level 37 or so, so why would they make a main quest go through such a crazy high level area? I cannot make it through that quest at all. 
---
I'm a step dad, have a side business and full time job, teaming up with people isn't easy as I don't have lots of time to play...

*reads all this guy's replies in the subthreads*

---
There's no cure for being a cunt.
---
10 to 1 you have borderless window mode enabled. Change it to full screen if so.
---
Never seen that one before, great find!
---
Agreed, but if so many items is on one place, should not it mean its not problem with quantity then? I don't know, call me crazy but something here smells fishy.
---
I definetly felt like it was odd. Im at work so instead of going through vague search results for five minutes, realizing it's the third choice down because the first two are links to why fo76 updates are terrible or something like that I figured. Hey. Someone here will know and give me a fast answer. 
---
The thing that I think is missing to make FO76 more authentic "WVa" is not log cabins ... but where are the three crosses on every bloody hill?
---
That was literally my first thought when I put it there :D
---
Your bad experience, is not what the majority of people experience though
---
The part where he was on the receiving end.
---
Crouch. Literally crouch and your invisible
---
I send random team invites. I just want the extra do from the perk or a quick fast travel. Just remember not all people are bad
---
.....that is why I will never have children. 
---
Yeah, just thinking out loud. It could also have to do with how they save your stash to the cloud perhaps...
---
I followed two lines of research on this question and came up empty handed on both, colors and origins.
---
Colors- I couldn't find anything about the BoS using orange regularly. The colors most attributed to them are steel, blue, and black on the coasts and yellow in the Midwest.
---
Origin- Robert Maxxon was based at Ft. Mariposa (Spanish for butterfly) which is based on the real, closed Ft. Ord, California. Ord was known for the presence of the 7th Infantry during WWII but nothing I read suggested a stronger presence of Signal Corps than the usual attachments. The butterfly tie in is interesting but probably a deadend as Monarch Butterflies are orange and black.
---
Noticed my first rollback last night, thought it was odd.  This will definitely need to be fixed before it gets out of hand.
---
username checks out! lmao
---
So every 100+ wearing Excavator is using that bug?  Srsly?
---
Anyone know if VATS targets people in chameleon stealth?
---
My overencumber ass is not worth inspecting because I got lots of garbage but still none of anyone's business.

One spawns at the Miners Monument, next to a protectron with a pickaxe stuck in it. 
---
You got one! Also take an upvote from me, this is the real treasure! 
---
just found it on my first try at the NAR repair yard!
---
Same.  Add me.  I play with one other guy.  Utchia23 
---
They are doable, but the lvl 52 mr handy's, assaultrons, and scorchbeasts still destroy me. 
---
I don't have any proof. I don't Dupe. But i have seen a few people comment on how to do it. Once again i haven't tested it nor will I. If you want scan the comments on the new patch notes. Someone posted it in Steps that you can easily follow. 
---
OxHorn is a favorite of mine 
---
Thats why i didnt get those 14 Molotovs!
---
300 hours and I haven't ever seen an Explosive weapon.
---
This way is so much more fun 
---
Methinks you were just looking to use the word "methinks" (which is one word)
---
It is indeed 5 mins for 5 water. The landfill purifier only ever has 5 in it, never less. It also is on a cyclic timer, so that it doesn't wait until you've emptied it out before resetting the 5 min timer. So at time=0, water=0. Time=5, water=5, if you loot this at lets say time=9 minutes, the next 5 waters will still appear at time=10, as opposed to time=14 (9+5)
---
I'm saying that the bug is likely the reason that some people who are lvl 100+ are using it, otherwise it would make more since to use X1 or Ultracite Power Armor.
---
Yes, ps4.
---
1000 would be just right IMO, especialy if vendors will be a thing in future patches. 
---
That freaking site was populated with datamined and fallout 4 info it seems. They have so much useless or incorrect information.

There's a huge wiki out there with the details but yeah,  Maxson was a US Army Captain

Has it been confirmed if this actually makes a difference? I've heard conflicting things about this. Also, can we just appreciate how ridiculous it is that an "online" game requires the editing of an ini file to save properly? I truly enjoy this game, but come on Bethesda, get it together.
---
I'm not on PC. I'm on PS4.  I haven't gotten the patch yet and have been getting kicked off regularly. 
---
Interesting, I've been to Ft Ord, and was stationed at a signal installation about 1.5 hours south of it. Odds are they would have mentioned that in the lore, though there are frequently facilities that are not advertised publicly. 
---
Now, the butterfly angle was one I had not considered. 
---
Have you done mayor for a day? They ignore you unless you attack them after that quest.
---
I'm curious about the whole "mule" thing...what is that?
---
Totally agree as someone whose camp is a modern art gallery outside of watoga. I’d rather show the weird af photos.
---
Many a true nerd has my vote. Even when he's complaining about the game, he usually has a good point, and he's amusing as hell. Oxhorn, while very interesting, is a bit overdramatic at times. 
---
Good job. I found one the other day that I've never seen anywhere else called "Harness", still in the locations that I posted. Keep grinding and you'll find some good stuff.
---
There will always be that one person, just like the guy that destroyed my camp. Everything is unlocked, free water for weeks! And now I have to collect copper to repair it all... bit it will still be unlocked for all the other people that can control themselves lol
---
Theories and opinions are fun but the guy that goes “yeah well I actually know this topic so it’s obviously not that theory haha” is never really liked so.
---
I got one of mine through a trade with my friend and the other 2 I got on at an enclave event (I had a seizure) and another one from a legendary glowing one at Whitespring Golf Club
---
My guess would be that they found some action they can spam and overwhelm the servers, causing the server to crash. 
---
Yes, I'm aware of the wiki. It was the ties to specific branches within the Army that were not covered (or not that I could find). 
---
Pso also was doing that at a point in gaming where it really hadn't been done like that before. The vast of the community is upset because of how blatantly Bethesda has been scheming their fans. People know that Bethesda is fully capable of delivering a more complete title, they know on both ends, that this game is of no effort. 80% of this game is recycled  or reskinned assets from previous titles or Dlcs. Bethesda put in minimal effort into this with ill intent for their fan base. The intent becomes very clear when you look at how they handled things with the collectors addition, and so on. I was a die hard Bethesda fan until this. This was like if I caught one of my friends trying to fuck my wife, and she shoots him down, and then we just continue being friends. Bethesda got caught doing some really greasy deeds. Go watch the E3 presentation pre release to 76, it's just Todd Howard on stage straight lying to people, bold face lie, for money. For real one of the worst scandals in gaming history.

Found this channel last week.
---
This guys posts videos of anything new in the Atom Shop, usually a few hours after the item drops. He doesnt buy them or anything, videos consist of him looking at the description and pictures. 
---
Get off your moral high horse. Raiders just wanna have fun.
---
All your assumptions are wrong. Go pvp a bit. You will get a ton of junk from dead players. I kill everyone on the server indiscriminatly. Im a high level player 100+. I roll with other high level players. 
---
You lose caps when your team wipes a bounty. 500 cap bounty rewards 250 caps. The game taxes it. I grind caps when im dying alot in pvp. Its not uncommon to lose 800 to 2000 caps pretty quickly. 1 camp smash can put a 500 cap bounty on you. If i smash 20 camps in one night...
---
I love this game and will keep playing it.
---
Whats the obsession with "something to gain". Im end game finished, less some 3 star armor pieces. Im having fun. Im a raider. You a bitch who cant tell me how to play a game i paid for. I was promised pvp. I am a pvper.  I kill every player on my server, wreck their camps and move to the next server to claim.
---
I got a clan building up too. Soon it could be 8 to 12 of us rolling your base instead of 3 or 4.
---
Fuckin killjoys out here. Im enjoying the game. buncha gamer nannys killin the fun.
---
Pretty sure you cant kill or collect bounties in a event zone
---
I do my sales run when I log in each day, today I am going to run an experiment in cap return value and time until vendor reset. i will edit this post with the exchange rate, my idea is to buy 100c worth and see what he then has for caps to buy back. I will then set a 20hr timer running and check back to that vendor and see if caps are reset.
---
Wish me luck considering the state of the game right now, maybe the hotfix today will have removed the new dupe.
---
basically from once you power it on every 5 minutes the purifier generates water, however if its is still full the waters generated disappear and at the next 5 minute mark the game tries again. It does not reset the 5 min counter when you empty it. So if you grab the waters at 4 minutes after the appeared, another 5 will appear in 1 minute, rather than having to wait another 5 mins from when you picked them up.
---
Also what a great movie.
---
Might be because ID relation (the fact is each time you put something in and out, servers need to synchronize the transaction) but then again, it should not matter how much items are in. If there is an item, i am no codder, but it should be text log with item id's and ammount of them, which should not be big and hard to read. 
---
As i said, i feel like the performance excuse is not 100% true right now.
---
I hope you've at least seen mothman. 
---
So, you stand still when someone is charging at you? You just made my point.
---
HA 
---
I drop extra stuff in the Overseer's crate in flatwoods
---
I do love FO4 but I think it squandered alot of its potential because your end game decisions and your ally developments did not seem to make a large impact like they did in New Vegas.  I loved watching the end and all the different scenarios.  FO3 I felt did well on that aswell to a lesser degree.  Outside of that FO4 was great.
---
Recently, I have started checking once per day for limited items and posting them here.  I'll keep doing it, even though I am downvoted for doing so.  If I help one person get something they want and would have otherwise missed, it's worth it.
---
As far as reviews go, this game has been a huge victim of click-bait reviews just like mass effect andromeda was. The number one thing that reviewers want is clicks and views. If jumping on the bandwagon is going to get their article noticed more and they are journalist of the week, they are going to push that out there. Todd saying during the reveal that it "Just works" and then releasing a letter "Stating it was broken before it launched and they know this and need the players to help them fix it". Was just begging for poor reviews and to make the issues look even more apparent for whiny players and reviewers to jump all over it for clicks and $$$  
---
This is definitely at least a 7.5/10 game and the 5/10 meta-critic is sorely undeserved.  
---
Like, explain to me how state of decay 2, a game with barely any story and very repetitive play gets an nearly 7/10+ across metacritic but fallout 76, a game that certainly has way more depth gets a 5/10. Reviewers need to stop trashing games so much for bugs. Maybe take 1 point off or half a point if it has some bugs not 2 or 3 whole points off. Bugs can be patched and almost always are. The actual game and its content should be mainly what is up for review not a handful of bugs docking it down to a 5/10.  
---
I am a supporter of the game by the way, I'm just telling you what I believe happened here.
---
We can't even leave stuff lying around in our camp and you want to hang dog balls off your pa?
---
Would be nice but don't see it happening anytime soon.
---
1500 for plasma , 1000 for tesla

New perk is fire and explosions. I'm assuming anything that works with demo expert like grenades.

Just south of thier, if your get hopwell? Howell? The dc cave, it'll spawn in a lvl 91 glowing dc every 5 mins, with a guarantee. 50 cal and a chance to be legendary.

Butterflies and metamorphosis in general play a large role in the background of Fallout so I thought it worth mentioning. Practically, I don't think the manly men of the BoS would credit their color scheme to a butterfly.
---
It can't target assaultrons when chameleon so probably does not work on players.
---
I see posts like this and I think, why are you still doing something that's bugged? What level are you if your sporting 3 star legendary gear? It's a low level quest.
---
What u mean,bro 
---
Rip only have 600
---
Ahhh, that would explain it. Thanks for enlighentement!
---
"Carefully" and "ended up clicking it" sounds contradictory.
---
You literally just completely ignored what I said and restated the same question.
---
So... Sure lol
---
Ah sorry I didn’t clarify that point - when I say one shot I’m referrijg to PvP. If you mean for PvE, this is fine and I agree - as long as there are satisfactory means for players to acquire them. I don’t want to have to pay thousands of caps on fo76bazaar because higher level content is locked away behind weapons that are unlikely to drop. For reference I have abysmal RNG luck and will never see a TSE. I’ve played hours every day since release and seen 0.
---
With PvP though...it just can’t stay. It’s too easy and trivializes any fight. And until devs eliminate PvP in the game, it’s something we have to consider.
---
yeah, when in an event you're technically grouped with everyone participating.
---
Yes that’s never nice,
---
I went in with my hazmat suit at level 52 in an attempt to kill the Queen but alas she was already dead so I sought shelter stop a roof and to my surprise I discovered three bags of loot (some three star) and some beautiful ultricite plans.
---
Something, I assume a few bloat flies shot at me (considering the minuscule amount of damage done) as I sprinted to freedom, loot firmly tucked under one arm after which I left for another server to mod my new found spoils of course.
---
I still haven’t even seen ONE behemoth, and here you are getting beat down by 7 of them. Jesus 😂
---
downvotes prolly coming from people trying to suppress metagame info to retain a PvP advantage maybe?  
---
If I get downvoted then I guess we have our answer, lol :)
---
Ill take 600 for the tesla 
---
Pistol? 
---
Ok, can ya people stop trying to start "controversies" for no real reason? The dev room exists but it doesn't 'exist' if you know what I mean. It's not supposed to be accessed normally. The stuff isn't supposed to spawn in normally. Nothing involving the dev room is supposed to be intended. This is completely different than a bunch of people running around with 1 million things in their inventory. There's no such thing as infinite space. That lag is caused by the servers struggling to comprehend *all* the things you're carrying. The server disconnect happens as a result of the server giving up and crashing since it can't keep up. Which is why Bethesda should *really* bring back the Inventory cap from 4 (where if you carry too much stuff you drop dead, no ifs, ands or buts), since 1) that would improve server stability and 2) it actually gives a punishment to being too overweight, since some people here actually seem to just deal with the inability to sprint or fast travel.
---
Never heard "**Keep your friends close, but enemies even closer**"? We can be enemies then! 
---
I AM GENIUS!
---
Easy enough to get if you grind nuke zones often or buy from others constantly
---
Ans any 308 ammo 
---
I would love guild/clan tags so we could build a reputation. Thats a fair way to identify raiders.
---
Im not doing anything wrong. Im playing a pvp game. 
---
Exactly, that's what seems so weird to me...It should be an increase. Now any town area is basically as bad as Watoga has been or Top of the World. It used to be isolated to those areas, but now numerous other areas are exhibiting the same issues. :(
---
That's just how the PC sees it.  Microphone Port or line in on the motherboard?  Yes.
---
I killed a level 7 with 10 cap bounty. He came back to me pissed asking if that made me feel good. Of course I said yes. Then he starts asking me to help him craft stuff, which I did, but was surprised hes asking the player that just killed him to craft for him.
---
So its a little wonky from my experience, but here is the jyzt of what I have experienced.
---
If you have 5 industrial purifiers, every minute a purified water can spawn in any of the 5 purifiers. Having 5 does not seem to give you 5 water procs per minute it only increases the amount you can create before having to remove the water from the purifier. It seems like each purifier style has its own timer that it shares with all purifiers of the same type. So if you have 5  industrial purifiers they can hold a max of 25 water before they stop producing, but still only produce at a rate of 1 per minute.
---
If you mix it up and create 1 or multiple of each style, you now have multiple independant timers for each style. Each style will produce x amount of water per hour, til all purifiers of that style are full. But it wil not add to the capacity of a purifier of a different style.
---
Hope this helps, and maybe somebody can help explain how the contents of my purifiers end up in my stash w/o me putting them there?!
---
Happy travels Wanderer
---
PC had a random update this morning, I wonder if that had anything to do with fixing this issue? I have noticed over the last few days that the servers have taken a heavy toll. Since launch, i have only DC'd about 3 times (two of those were SB Queens). Since patch last week, it's happened 3 or 4 times a play session each day. 
---
DUPE's. . .This is why we can't have nice things. 
---
Plot Twist: Wooby is actually the end end-game boss.
---
Scorchbeasts are the most annoying fight ever. If they are at at your level or maybe even a bit below it’s just a time killer. They won’t kill you if you have stimpacks but they just fly around and soak up damage. By the time they are half dead I’m bored out of my mind. 
---
yep I suspect research fo4's more publicly research and exposed DR system will yield the data you so desperately crave.  
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)

There is no mod support, and while mods do exist, they'll have questionable stability if bethesda pushes stealth patches.

Same guy who made the scorch beasts loot table probably
---
It can.

This might help - not exhaustive, and not mine, but still, a good baseline:

---
Sorry did not wanted to seem ignorant. Its just weird that a location and ammount would be so closely tied together when we can see on one location on a map there is so much different items, and server still ran just fine.
---
I would go for all chameleon then since they all stack. I followed this guy's build who killed a scorch beast with a level 1 pipe gun: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI) and you can modify things to experiment but using Stand Fast as armor chest is important. Hope that gives you some extra ideas! 
---
Yeah they left that rather open.  
---
All 3 of those will always be a pretty bad time, really.

What they said. I still sneak through areas to reach my objective. Rather than trying to kill everything that moves
---
I couldn’t resist the urge last night, first time there. I got a cryogrenade. Just one. 
---
Scorched if plasma
---
I have 308 ammo, I won’t be on until like 9 I have to study for midterms plus I got a lot to do. So if you can save it I’ll get you those caps then
---
I wouldn't hold on to either of those, though. The quantities you need mean that you can just run through one or two locations to farm enough for your immediate repair needs.
---
If you do stash these, keep the quantities really low.
---
Fair enough. I'll keep digging, but it's probably going to be another unanswered question. 
---
My main is level 240 and I still wear Excavator PA. I've tried all the builds and come to the conclusion that it's pointless running a main with anything less than 15 Luck and huge carry weight. I didn't believe the Luck would make so much difference but with 15 I get so many more 2 and 3 star legendaries than I used to and they have much better durability, if I need to increase Intelligence to craft I just pop on an Unyielding set and take Berry Mentats.
---
With 550 carry weight I pick up EVERYTHING, I never need to waste any time looking at the loot on mobs. I use the huge amount of steel/leather/cloth/wood I collect to powerlevel alts by crafting on them with all the XP boosts running then play "fun" builds on those and use them to sell to 6 of the vendors each day.
---
There is no content in this game, other than the SBQ, that requires a specialised build. If people think they need to run around on 10% health to one shot the same mobs I one shot in Excavator PA then they're welcome to. Meanwhile I get to pick up around 300 pounds more loot than them.
---
No, I walk backwards, it's that or flee. There's not much options for ranged to really combat a melee user. "Oh but keep your distance!" except the issue with keeping your distance is the lack of damage you do while keeping your distance, so they get to heal up.
---
And what is your point exactly? That it's skilled to wear PA and have the ability to chug all the stimpacks needed to heal back to full in an instant?
---
To kind of quibble a bit here, I think your issue might be right there in the topic title - "Battling" Watoga. You don't have to, and you shouldn't have to, defeat all of the bots in Watoga. There are a ton of them, and while you get decent EXP, lead and aluminum from them, they're slow and easy to just run - or walk - away from. Just do the Brotherhood mission for now, and when you hit Level 50, come back and do Mayor for a Day. (That has a good, unique weapon at the end.)
---
Those are pretty much your only options. Grind up your level, team up, or try to sneak. 
---
Also Channel5 Gaming!
---
First off, who names thier kid Dbo?!
---
Secondly, yes.  Actively help in the fight by killing anything and everything!  Don't just hide in the shed after hitting the queen once.
---
Do you know when that patch will drop on console?
---
I only played it once, so what? Are you saying I shouldn't play the game? Lol.
---
Helped nuke Welch this weekend. Not a lot of legendaries but the spawn rate was through the roof. The miners were respawning about as quick as we cleared the area. A single scorch beast showed. Nothing all that amazing.
---
I wonder what you'd get from a nuke on Vault 76?
---
I firmly believe the event should be level gated to level 50. There’s been too many times where a sub level 30 player gets in there to do nothing but make the event harder
---
no they do not all games subreddit are whiny posts so they don't watch to read it
---
Chameleon only works with your weapon drawn, so make sure your gun is out.
---
No, it sounds like despite my carefulness, I still clicked it, meaning the popping up of armor was THAT bad.
---
Yeah bro ill save it , good luck on,ur midterms too 
---
Could be a luck thing
---
Actuly, the new crashes are just because the new duplications bugs, thats what i heard at least.
---
And you cant carry much stuff around, static place with static items should not affect performance, after they are on x and y location, at least by my logic. It only affects the size of log file on a servers keeping track of what items you have. It does not change location. Its once placed and thats it. You only add values/items to it.
---
Somebody gets it ;)
---
Thanks man 
---
Thanks man. See you at 9. I’ll send my gamer tag then
---
Nothing. It’s in a no fire zone

Ghouls also spawn there along with the other three groups. Anecdotally it feels like mutants are the most common. 
---
I had to server hop just to get some events to start up. I'm very much used to Monongah Power screeching over the radio every time I near the place so it was surprising it didn't auto-start the event like usual.
---
Did eventually complete it, was just something in noticed. Also found the X-01 jet pack at Enclave due to that hop so probably for the better. 
---
Only a COMMIE commits duping!
---
You can't nuke there unfortunately, it and most of the left side of the map is in a "safe zone". Most likely so under level characters don't get blasted as soon as they leave the vault. 
---
Sun TSE said in the Art of Duping the true art of duping is to acquire your items without grinding.
---
Haha I had a feeling. But still it’s really too bad that it’s not actually a thing

I think it is mostly people pulling crap out of their rear ends. It is seemingly called a scapegoat for Bethesda's shitty servers. I know dupers are terrible and they fuck the game up but the server instability was there MOMENTS after the servers came back online. People were getting kicked within the first few minutes, I witnessed multiple times that it happened and you cant say there were thousands of people duping the second the servers came back online. I haven't witnessed any duping and haven't seen anything in game happen like this either. Witch Hunts are fun though.
---
Lvl 45, never found a tse or even a two shot.
---
it's an optional PvP game. You are exploiting a loophole to harass other players who don't want PvP and that is  wrong.
---
The legit way to PvP is to shoot once and see if the other player shoots back. 
---
You are never going to raid the CAMP of a high level player cause you are a bitch and you know what will happen if you do.

That doesn’t help anyone on console

Many a true nerd had a good fallout 76 series but he jut finished it he said he would return to it in the future when they add more content.

 I find or build my own stuff. I know how MMOs work and I don't like the outside market around them as it hurts the internal economics.  I intend to run a crafter/trader in game, and this crap does not help at all.

 I would be much more draconian than Bethesda has been. I would break my fucking ban hammer. ;) 
---
90% reduced weight and it still weighs 5 pounds. The Handmade Rifle weighs way to much
---
Yeah my bad, meant to say the Minigun was better than the actual TSE drops, a level 30 pistol, 35 Gauss and 45 Tesla.
---
Unless it was bugged for you, they also did pre-patch. 
---
How often you playing 
---
Interesting, because I was also careful, and when my item appeared I didn't click it, and I didn't lose my item.
---
Haha scorch queen killed in 5 mins that went very well , thanks everyone that joined

"One shot shit show" is a new perfect phrase for the Fo76 lexicon.

Ohhhh...makes sense.

Dear god....why? just let the man post in peace.

They also have auto aim lol. I feel like the never miss if you aren't jumping and skipping around haha

So far I've only bought the animatronic Santa, hardwood florrs, an intact door, and the "Have a Day" player Icon...honestly don't feel butthurt about any of it.
---
I found a super mutant behemoth a twin lakes. He always spawns in a lake with a radioactive pump down the hill. I got a night vision suppressed gauss rifle from him
---
be nice if they only came out one end of the damn beasts but they fart at you as well, and don't seem to have a cooldown on that crap. One queen battle we had a dozen or so fighting the queen and then suddenly there were 7 regular beasts spamming the group and no one could even tell where the queen had gone, timer ended up running out on it.
---
I'll kill low levels for their bounty.  I typically place goodies in thir bag like a few hundred rounds of ammo and health items.  
---
You cant build legendaries bro , also the game is meant to have an economy , why you should be worried about is duplicating items , that ruins the economy .
---
Updooting for originality! 
---
I really like the Nimble Fingers perk.  
---
would make the single action revolver a lot less annoying if you pair it with speed demon. 
---
Hmm, a bit weird to have it work that far off.
---
I usually just put the edge of the nuke zone on prime and keep north of it clear to have that workbench shed be out of the rads.
---
heh, that was a good video :) Thanks for sharing it!
---
Not my vision for the bitch though, she's a tank, and never backs off.
---
Maybe, at their forward bases, they had various dishes set up and the last mission is a radio transmitter chase.  But they had scribes that were able to fix things better than the normal soldiers, so maybe not?

---
Hey scav, thanks for the post. Do you know how you confirmed the info regarding doing the event quests for the first time? Trying to figure out how to get some of the other quest related rewards too so I'm checking to see if there's a correlation between all of them
---
None, and I've bought quite a few things.
---
Its the same algorithm that is used on two shot weapons (on fallout 4 at least so I presume here too) in that the number is the base damage multiplier rather than the post-mod damage multiplier, thus 2-shot is actually more like 1.57 or something.
---
I loved Fallout 4! I spent untold hours just building and experimenting with switches and logic gates. I play this game mostly the same way. Most of my time is spent collecting and selling scrap and buying plans to build new stuff. I find the quests pretty boring although the game world and locations are pretty interesting. 
---
oof ;)
---
Good pun :)
---
Nope.  It'd be nice to see those in the future, bit I'm not holding my breath.

You're welcome man, I too can play for hours with no crashes in borderless window (still does from time to time).

Nuke Morgantown, it's like whitesprings so it's pretty worth. 
---
Entertainment(video games, movies, plays, tv shows) has always been a case of wait and see if it's good to experience it. That is why there is an entire industry of reviewers for those forms of entertainment. Obviously it was an oversight. There are a lot of them, and the game will and has gotten better over time. 
---
No, No, No. There are numerous games that have been released that were full of bugs like FO76. Every Bethesda game(Morrowind was the first I played), Superman 64, Sonic 2006, Might and Magic X &amp; XI. At least Bethesda games eventually get fixed unlike the others that I bought or was gifted.

Food, water and fusion core drain increase or bug? Me and my brother played during weekend, his second time and I’ve played since launch.
---
We had some issues with the quick drain and carry weight combined, I noticed it the most since I got my farm routes. I know the fusion core used to be bugged and reset but I’ve had no issue with food and drinks before.
---
It took me 2 days to do the DMV mission...all the disconnect and CTD...gosh.
---
Whatever it’s called
---
Yeah, that's what I read too. 
---
lol,  I know I need to take a picture... otw to work there is this old bridge next to the abandoned Goodall Rubber Plant, next to the building in this little alcove there has been for months a suitcase and a rolled up cloth... It looks like it right out of Fallout.

You're neglecting a lot of nuance and humanity in your approach. I think you're missing my point. The world isn't cut and dry. People aren't strictly good or strictly bad. 0 tolerance heavy punishment policy without any grey area is always a problem. People do not respond well to being forced to behave a certain way through fear. It is not a motivator.
---
If a child is acting out in school, it's not always because they're just a little shit. Maybe dad screamed at mom all morning and she never defended herself. The child feels both sad for mom but angry that she didn't fight back. They show up to school incredibly emotionally charged, whereas classmates and teachers are just waking up. He acts out a bit for whatever reason. Should he be HIT by a teacher for acting out, then back to class as usual? Sure, he may not do it again out of fear of punishment, but in his eyes, he was already very upset, he went too far as kids do, then the one adult not in their abuse bubble *hits* them for being bad. Think of how that would mess with a kids head. Would that child have *any* trust in adults, when those at home act like children, and the ones at school take a stiff upper lip and physically strike you. 
---
Their dysfunction just becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Modern school systems would send that kid to In School Suspension for the day. And guess where else? The counselor. They try to see why a child might be acting out. 90% of kids are innocent as fuck, and are usually just acting out what they see around them. I had a friend that I've known since 1st grade. He was in and out of ISS all through lower grades. He was friends with the counselor. He was forced to take the short bus in middle school because his toxic parents said he had anger problems. High school though? Became his own man. He had adults in his life that may disapprove of his actions, but they didn't disapprove of his feelings. They helped him figure out his frustrations, and now he's a contributing member of society, incredible kind and gentle man. 
---
Society is moving forward. Laws and rules are in place, but we have the added benefit of a degree of empathy and humanity in it. Perps can be sent to therapy, admitted, or have probation instead of prison time. Probation is the State saying, ok, we believe you when you say you won't do it again, we'll keep tabs to make sure, just don't do it again. 
---
We're never going back to how the world was. In this age of total interconnection, any and everything is vulnerable to questions. The people have the power to keep authority accountable, forcing authority to treat them as empathetic people to at least some degree.
---
You can stand for the rules all you want. I'm right there with you. But rules can change for the better and be more fair. People respond better when they feel acknowledged and respected. If the law respects you, then you're more likely to respect the law.
---
Cut and dry black and white action isn't highly moral or infallible. It's honestly a lazy way to enforce rules. Half baked thought without considering everything involved. And honestly, the most dangerous type of approach. If you're sucked into the justice portion of it, your point as to why you're seeking that justice dissolves. It ends up making your end result look nothing like the intent or when you started out. 
---
There's strength in Empathy, one that makes obedience *easier* to attain, as respect is the literal key to human communication. Respect someones humanity, and maybe they'll actually admit and confront the part of them that messed up.
---
Same, and getting about a 15 FPS drop and a ton of instability 
---
Can you understand that all that stuff being in one place and all that stuff being in 24 different places (number of people on a server) are two totally different things?
---
Inhospitable Hoe Man-Scorched with a Shovel
---
Loch Ness Lobster is obviously a mirelurk.
---
El Scubacabra-Mirelurk King
---
Yakalope-Radstag
---
Who are the other 2? :)
---
I dont see how thats much better in any regard but alright I get your point.
---
But then we still get to the part where the game is buggy as hell so it is not unreasonable to assume there are various ways to duplicate items. If you want to remain skeptical until you see solid evidence thats fine, just dont act like it would be such a shock.
---
Okay, cuter answer than I expected.
---
Humbug!
---
You have to travel to the far south of the map.  To the fallout 76 garrahan mining headquarters.  Once you get to the area you will automatically start the quest.
---
It's not too hard.  About 3 point investigations.  The area can spawn some nasties, so you might want a partner to make it easier on you.
---
First time I went it was level 20-35 robots.  Very easy as the 35 robots were the kind that just spit out black smoke and don't really attack unless you get within melee range.
---
Second time (when I went to finish it) there were level 15-35 Super Mutants, two of the 35s were 2 Star Legendaries with Miniguns.  That one hurt, but I was level 35 and my teammate was 25.  We took them down with only two deaths.
---
Damn I was looking forward to checking out the changes this afternoon. If this isn’t fixed soon I’ll probably just give up. 
---
I've seen that a few times now but I've never tried it. It's great when the railroad gets nuked.
---
Well, I only purchase using Atoms earned through playing, thank goodness. I regret "buying" the Vault-Tec paint for PA, because I never use PA; and I regret the Vault-Tec tents--they don't fit anywhere very well. 
---
After a few those get disappointing as well.
---
Where do you get plans from
---
woosh
---
Your loss!  It's a fun game and getting better all the time.  The fact you know about it, and tried to encourage someone to enter it, tells me a lot about you!
---
It’s not worth spending special points on those perks though if you want to deal out enough damage to higher level enemies.
---
Later on you can just use super duper when cooking food and you’ll have ample.
---
What's the best thing you picked up?
---
or we can stack them like in that movie,,, ahh what was that ready player one?
---
But it's not 50 wood and steel. It's gears, springs, nuclear mat, aluminum, several stable fluxes, oil etc.
---
you are simply delusional about actual costs of a CAMP raid
---
When you do get around to the quests you'll get some pretty nice level 50 gear. :)
---
maybe it's just me but I feel its players outside the US that are experiencing this DC/CTD issue the most. Wish I could poll the player base and find out, might lead to a better understanding of why it's happening.
---
Oh gotcha.
---
I'm sorry you lost your minigun. =\
---
And nope he's now not in an event zone, still unkillable
---
All I have to go on is modern military. The scribes would have all been signal, I'd bet. It's what we do now. Build and maintain the communications network. 
---
The inclusion of the combat arms side if things is where it got my curiosity. Usually signal assets are given out to other units, you don't normally fold them into a signal unit. So retaining/using orange is unusual in my mind. 
---
I run an explosive shotgun and will usually deal with adds while she's in the air since i can't really do damage as she flies.  Pacifist mode makes it real easy to just carpet bomb the area around other players to mulch the trash mobs.
---
Even if you did kill him, you would've just made the SBQ harder to kill since he wouldn't of left the event when he respawned, but the game would still count him respawning as a new player joining the event.
---
So really, don't bounty hunt at the SBQ, cause you collecting that handful of caps could be the reason why it fails to get killed in time. Also, could piss the person off and have them sit out and just wait after tagging the queen.
---
But hey, got your handful of caps, who cares if the queen is killed, right?
---
Team up with someone with an explosive shot gun. Go to a nuke zone and just tag. Let them kill.
---
A 2nd character just for storage.  
---
&gt;Are you saying I shouldn't play the game?
---
Why would you ask that, other than try and obscure the fact that your story comes across as less than honest. 
---
You knew it's bugged, you were careful, but still you lost your armor. 
---
Your story sounds fake. Not that this doesn't happen. Just that you weren't paying attention or was being careful, but that you blindly clicked and now are upset. 
---
I seen a lvl 20 giant sloth today by someones camp and i was shooting it but nothing happened, it started to attack me and it hurt lol
---
Op = little boy
---
Nothing much else to say on the matter.
---
But you can blame them for releasing a game FULL of things that should have been updated in what is basically a re-hash of a game that was release years ago. I love the game - let's make that crystal clear. But I can't pretend it isn't the literal worst qualify game I have ever played in my entire life - going back to installing games through multiple floppy disks. Last week, 8 hours between Friday afternoon and Saturday night, my game crashed (I kept count) 21 times. I tried to mod weapons, crash. Loot a body, crash. Take step after fast traveling, crash. Run down the stairs of Whitespring to the shops, get to the hallway, reset to back up the stairs like I could teleport, keep running, crash. Swing a super sledge, crash. Fight the SBQ, 4 crashes. Says I can't teleport inside a nuke zone, does it anyways but takes me out of my power armor so I have to stand there while it loads while taking crazy radiation, die, then crash. Have someone drop a nuke on my server so I fast travel near the edge of the blast zone, step in, see every enemy through all the walls, they ALL attack me, then 90% of the bodies disappear when I start looting, crash, log back in, different server, bodies still there, unlootable, crash. FFS the scorched still hold their weapons like their hands are made of lego bricks covered in wet glue. I had 3 scorched T pose through the whitespring bunker security door, laser grid, and vault door at me. Then my game crashed. Every. Single. Time I log in, I have to listen to Rosie repeat the quest I'm on through the emergency system. I have to listed to the Novice Holotape for the Mystery questline to make it go away, every. single. time. This game is SO ridiculously horrendous when it comes to the barest minimum of fundamentally simple no-brainers, it's dumbfounding.  It's really fun though- it's a massive contradiction and I hate that I continue to play it despite it being the most infuriating-because-of-glitches game I've ever heard of, let alone played. /Rant over. This was supposed to be a small comment, but nope. MY game has crashed at least 150 times since the B.E.T.A. ended. If you totaled every single game I've ever played and how many times they've crashed since 1995, fallout 76 would hands-down take the prize for most crashes.  
---
Your enjoyment wears out after a snowball effect of similar realizations
---
For gameplay yes.  For realism?  Nope.  A group of raiders flooded Charleston for some left overs, story wise it makes complete sense some psycho would nuke vault scum.
---
Great idea, I didn’t see a link to the spreadsheet.  
---
I wonder how this is going to work out for the event at Morgantown airport. Seems like it was designed so that everyone can pull from the supply drop at the end. This feels like a bug but if it isn't they should definitely un-"fix" it
---
Oh bother.
---
As someone who started out as a rifle character and switched to heavy guns, let me point out three things:
---
* **cheap ammo**: 50Cal/5mm ammo is so cheap to craft that despite lower damage per hit, heavy guns ultimately offer more damage for the crafting resources.
---
* **weight**: with *Bear Arms*, heavy guns weigh 90% less. That means a Gatling Gun, 50Cal Machine Gun, and Fat Man weigh half what *one* well-modded Handmade does. With no equivalent rifle perk, this is a serious advantage.
---
* **mags**: even with drum mags, rifles fall well short of the 50Cal's 250rnd and Gatling Gun's 500rnd mags. I'd estimate 70% of my fights require zero reloads. With a pair of TSE 50Cals, that'd probably be 90% (and weigh only 2 more).
---
Notes:
---
* I'm running a TSE 50Cal MG (primary), TS Gatling Gun (for CQB), and TS Fat Man (SHTF). That's a ton of firepower. That said, without Legendary effects, heavy guns would be less attractive.
---
* Before this I ran a TSE Radium Rifle and TS Handmade. This was frankly more fun (and I still haven't sold the radium rifle). But it cost more inventory weight, for lower overall dps on target in almost any scenario.
---
* I recommend *Bandolier* for *any* ranged weapon build, but especially heavy gunning. Without it, rifles are a bit more appealing.
---
* *Stabilized* requires PA but beats *Tank Killer*'s penetration. Without PA, rifles look better.
---
* *Tenderizer* buffs heavy gunners more due to their higher rate of fire.
---
* Using *Gunsmith* when shooting and *Weapon Artisan* when repairing, weapon condition has never been a factor for me, including in extended Scorchbeast Queen engagements. I've never felt any need to add Luck of the Draw.
---
lol the end
---
Ah yes, I see you are a man of culture as well. (DND) 
---
Would love to play a bard in the wasteland. Would make that end game grind of a queen much easier if we had a bard buffing our attacks and defenses. 
---
Even Fissure site can be underwhelming right now. 
---
last two times I went to a nuke there we killed the queen and she was unlootable for everyone there and then her body disappeared. 
---
I do realize that isn't supposed to be happening, but it still does. 
---
Also the first time I went to a nuke there I saw a constant horde of all types of scorched enemies and a decent amount of them being legendary. 
---
I feel like those spawns aren't as consistent recently. especially when it comes to legendary enemies. 
---
Dude the chances of getting a two shot is rare enough, let alone 2 effects of something that you want. Due to duping and the commonality of TSE weapons you have been led to believe they are dropping like candy from enemies, which is absolutely false.
---
Create a new character for their carry weight. Much like a pack mule. Fairly common term in MMOs (I think)
---
Main - your main character. 
---
Alt - your other character(s). 
---
Mule - character you made simply to carry all of the extra crap you don't want to store on your other characters. 
---
Essentially, you need a friend. Step 1, create "the mule". Step 2, transfer all of the crap you are sick of carrying but don't want to get rid of to a friend. Step 3, log into the new character. Step 4, friend transfers all that crap back to you. 
---
Since you don't care about carry weight, you basically now have infinite inventory at the expense of requiring a friend (or completely separate account) to also be logged in with you.
---
With a 600lb stash limit, if there are any legendary things you want to keep just because they are cool, or may be useful if they weren't completely broken (legendary railway spike guns, etc), you would just transfer it to your mule character until the day comes when you need the stuff. 
---
I raid everyone but i roll in a pack. 
---
2 snipers. Me: melee hammer. I go in. Snipers take perimeters. I Smash. Die sometimes (they get a free shot on me so i die alot) . Snipers get the kill. Then pvp back and forth begins. 
---
Its called having fun.  Its great when we run into other groups of 3+. Then other people come along. Ive had a 15+ person pvp fight near a trainstation camp we were wrecking. Once..
---
Hit revenge kids. Cut loose. Have fun.
---
The red metal fireplace. The glow in the dark map poster. The fish lamp. The fruit hat. The black and white cowboy outfit. The string of twinkly lights. 
---
correct, i will switch it up to f/s, thanks!
---
Wub!
---
any fixes yet ?
---
Wooby is a random NPC in the dev room, Bethesda test rooms always have an NPC. Wooby is nothing but a developer naming a test vendor.
---
Deathclaw Traveling Merchant is a bug. I've seen this "event" several times in different areas of the map. When it spawns correctly, you'll find a living deathclaw surrounded by 3 dead human traveling merchants. If it spawns incorrectly, some or all of the human bodies will not be present, and the deathclaw is instead labeled as the traveling merchant.
---
It's just a spawn in bug of some sort.
---
Gives you infinite storage space on a secondary character.
---
Handing items to a friend, to hand back to an alternate character of yours.
---
Or using Friend's List, placing items in a container, and re-entering same world that friend was in with a different character.
---
I'll make a new save for our group
---
I really must be on the minority who didn't really has lots of crazy or game breaking bugs as launch, but had found a few new ones with consecutive updates. Cause the game at launch for me was pretty serviceable.
---
Usually people have triggered it when travelling to the asylum and they just go inside then fast travel away from inside having taken care of business (loot ammo bags).
---
Rarely does anyone do this one but if I fast travel there I’m doing it regardless because I spent the damn caps....plus my build makes it easy enough to take down scorch beasts down unless the stealth damage bonus bugs out 
---
I was thinking that, as well, but it was at the Whitesprings, and there were other weapons there. My feeling was that it was legit, and somebody just sold it off.
---
 Yeah your prices are reasonable. I just assume nearly all of this crap is duped. I may be too suspicious, but its fucking our game up.
---
Where can I get those mods ?
---
The one I’m aware of is new and involves 3 people.
---
I had literally just found the last lvl 50 piece for my T-51 power armor.  A few days before I was having a buddy that had unlocked the Nuka paint job paint what I had, and now all that was left to paint was the missing leg.
---
There were probably half a dozen of us partied up and hanging out in a friends camp (pooling resources and the like in preparation for a queen run). My friends camp had a GAPING hole in the side because reasons... He has since fixed the breach due to this incident.
---
Unfortunately, there is no way to trade power armor, it has to be dropped and picked up by the other party to exchange ownership.
---
The congregation of people must have looked enticing on the map, because as I dropped the armor for my friend to pick up, a wild rando came flying into the camp.  I frantically shouted at my friend to get in the armor, but it was too late. With my hands tied I watched as the rando inserted a power core into the armor and died just a little on the inside. I still watch that animation play out in my head and can vividly recall that sinking feeling.
---
After 2 or 3 seconds of confusion, and everyone stunned at what just occurred, my friends light him up.  Mind you none of them were below level 70 and the majority were 110+. We tried messaging the guy, we chased him, tried to instigate trading, my friend who's camp this happened in even offered up 2000 caps to get it back, but this dude was absolutely relishing what he had just gotten away with. It was like a dog that had just stolen a steak off the counter from its elderly owner and was elated knowing there was nothing they could do about it. He started trolling back in the messages, stripped  took the all the griefs we were dishing out.
---
The armor was gone.
---
Aside from an absolute murder by words I sent him about him having to watch his mother die, we managed some small revenge.  My friend watched the map until he made the mistake of going back to his camp. At which point we fast traveled there and I raised it to the ground.  We left absolutely nothing standing. Complete decimation. He showed up once or twice but there were three of us so he was dispatched fairly quickly.  At one point we left the area and allowed him a feeble attempt repairs his camp. Then we popped out of the woods and laid it (and him) low again.
---
He finally left the sever but continued to troll me for the next day or so over messages. Sending me picks saying stuff like "I'll take good care of it" and "oops I got a scratch on it."
---
I have a new set of T-51 with the fancy Nuka paint job that all my friends farmed and put together for me.  Bunch of bozo's I wouldn't trade for the world.
---
Or nothing at all
---
So much wrong with Pvp, It's hardly skill based. I have yet to come out of pvp with a feeling like a clutched it and came out victorious. It's fine though I don't really play this game for pvp.
---
You should report him, they will comm ban for literally ANY profanity use now
---
Higher luck is on paper, supposed to affect the durability of weapons and something else.. not the quality of loot.
---
PvP might be more fun when the Fireproof perk is updated with the coming console patch. But if you are taking the workshop from another player then I don't sympathise. If you are claiming it yourself and another player is attacking, then you should spend more time on defenses and maybe try some different defensive tactics.
---
Merchandising is a great way to build brand loyalty though, if done correctly. What you put your IP on directly reflects on your company. Disney bought Star Wars and poor no more Star Wars slot machines. Why? Because Disney understands the image they want to present. 
---
Bethesda should just charge a tiny bit more and provide higher quality merchandise. Gamers would likely spend more if they could trust that merchandise was quality from Bethesda. 
---
My buddy and I attacked a players camp once, did a bit of destruction then we got into a fight. He went down kinda easy the first time, but threw on his PA and tried approaching us various ways, sometimes killing us sometimes we'd kill him. Some others eventually showed up and it turned into a 2v2v2 battle. We fast traveled to my camp at one point, and they followed, which was very cool because my camp was in the woods so it was pretty hard to see where people would approach from. Traded some kills for a while, had some pretty intense fights, and we eventually parted in what seemed like good terms. This was before dupes were widely known and TSE wasn't a factor in the fight, just melee and rifles, so it was pretty enjoyable. I doubt I'll get involved much in PvP these days until they do some balancing. 
---
Lvl 130 and just listened to volunteer training 101 I've done the enclave but that's it. 
---
Down in Watoga, in the hospital, came across a space marine jangles the moon monkey with a toy alien stuck to its face. Immediately took a pic. 
---
If it's taking that long, sure the lower leveled people could help out but all my weapons would break 1/2 way in anyway.
---
Yep I guess that's a pro for getting so distracted
---
I've had a few actually.  One hilarious encounter with a guy that barricaded himself in the munitions factory...I should upload that.
---
lol I think you're the one that's throwing the tantrum
---
lol man...people here are so mad...
---
I like it when my base gets attacked because then I get that sweet sweet chance to do full damage and take their caps.
---
I don't know if people are misunderstanding your message or just super salty about the fact that it's true.
---
The game has bounties for a reason.
---
Wow
---
My point still stands lol
---
Your reading comprehension is 0 of 3.  Perk wisely.
---
Did you know that if you scrap C.A.M.P. objects **that that** you get back half of the materials used to build them? (I get frustrated each time I see that tip).
---
I'd love to know the answer as well.
---
Also fireproof and Assassin's gear, perhaps dense and padded armor aswell.
---
TSE can be rendered nearly useless PvP on PC.
---
All the time!  Just recently I decided to PVP some guy at his workshop and he kept seeking revenge over and over.  Gave me 700 or so caps, the kind soul.
---
Btw if you're getting one shot it just means you do not have pvp gear/perks.  Unless you're going to farm/trade those up I would avoid PVP.  
---
None. I've bought some photo mode poses, an icon, starlet sniper, and reindeer antlers. I like all of them, and I didn't use any real money to buy them so I guess that helps too.
---
I once spent like $30 on lunchboxes in fallout shelter though. It was a dumb impulsive sleep deprived at 3 AM thing. I regret that..
---
I've def given this some thought too.  My take is that Bethesda wanted that player raiding experience to mirror the settlement experience in Fallout 4, requiring you to occasionally defend your settlers, etc.  The difference of course is that it didn't take much to set up your settlements to actually be able to defend themselves successfully and/or with little intervention.  In 76 you get groups of lvl 100s griefing lowbies.  
---
I actually like the idea of always on PVP, having to defend your base, etc.  I'm just not sure it's even possible to balance it in this game; it just doesn't seem to work as intended.  So, yeah, PVE servers would sure be nice right about now.  
---
WOW yeah there is so much to do in this game
---
I want a hermit crab inside a tank shell.
---
hey, that dude is [scary](http://friday.wikia.com/wiki/Deebo)
---
/r/fifthworldproblems
---
Yep, the ones where I won.
---
You actually have the best luck ever, I'm going to need you to tell me your loadout and what you were doing when you picked up this fine piece of booty &gt;:3
---
Nah in all seriousness, what kind of perks are you running to up the damage on this gun?
---
Lol, what? You are legitimitely insane. I didn't know it was bugged, if you read the forst sentence of my post, lol. Why would I lie about this mundane thing anyways?
---
I'd have no problem with them patching duplicates,  then removing them from the game for awhile,  till it gets more balanced. 
---
This is a rabbit hole and it will drive you mad.
---
Handmades (which look a lot like AK-47s) should probably use .308.
---
Hunting rifles chambered for .50 should probably hit a lot harder than those chambered for .308.
---
There should be a rifle that looks a lot like an AR-15, and it should use .223.
---
On that note, there should be a ton of really light-weight pistols and rifles chambered for .22lr.
---
Pipe guns should not be able to use anything bigger than a .45 cartridge (no rifle calibers like .308), and there should be a bb option as well.
---
And where the heck are the 9mm guns? 9mm should be everywhere!
---
If you want to be happy with guns in this game, you've got to let it go, just like I'm trying to do...
---
Now my rant is over, too.
---
Yeah I'm with you, ever since they made PA separate from regular armor, I haven't really liked PA.
---
Upvote!
---
Ppl just downvote to downvote. Ain't no sense in trying to figure it out. Lol
---
They said this will be fixed in the next patch. I will miss getting beaten with a flamer.
---
Dude. We had an epic battle behind whitesprings yesterday that just spawned out of one dudes little 5 cap bounty and grew to around 8 guys and lasted like 30 minutes. It was a lot of fun and we all died a lot.
---
Tbh not really I'm mostly getting killed randomly by high level players when trading/building
---
had average fun pvp experiences before TSE weapons became a thing. 
---
 1-shot kill builds already existed before but at least it didn't only require to just shoot a bullet at your feet.
---
They already are. It's called a mule account. Take that into the developer room, pull all of the stuff out, then transfer it to other accounts before the mule gets banned. Sell the legendaries for real world monies and bam, you're making profit, despite having to buy multiple copies of the game. As for appealing, why bother? Just buy another copy, lather, rinse, repeat.
---
I play a lot and this is a rarity for me and everyone I know that plays this.  I would say that you may not want to worry too much and let this dissuade you from playing.  
---
Also looking forward to screenshots of this.
---
I bought a nice rosewood door. That is all I have purchase so far.
---
 Yeah I don't quest either. ;) That's not entirely true as I do have an Enclave X0-1, but the only questing has been for that kind of thing or for rare mats.
---
 Its faster leveling just killing tough enemies, than any event or quest.
---
Does he carry poisonous hotdogs?
---
I used it for a while on my unarmed rifleman character and It had similar if no the same animations as the deathclaw guantlet so i was thinking it is unarmed
---
nope, it was caps, it just wasn't told to you right away unless you asked some one about it
---
Humans fucking suck, and are complete pieces of shit when given the protection of anonymity. It’s really about as simple as that! ;-)
---
Good for you, doesn't change the fact that BGS does not make it easy to roleplay as a: trader, raider, mercenary, or really anything without going to an external source.
---
Yeah, before there werent so many tse weapons
---
He might be an ass, but he's definitely not wrong. They intended it to be this way.
---
Its a PVP zone!  There is no room for sympathy.  People need to stop feeling entitled to claim them without having to run the risk associated with ownership.  
---
I normally have my camp open with every type of craft bench available including pa workbench and bed and try to get new players in the vicinity to come check it out. One day I found a level 7 guy wandering about so i dropped him some stuff and led him to my camp. I was really excited that someone was finally visiting my place. Then i noticed there was another player at the foot of my steps. About level 120 in pa. I just think, oh yay another player to help! After waving and receiving a wave i opened my locked door to the camp. He looks around and then starts attacking us. I spam the angry emote as he stabs at us with a switchblade. I just stand there after the other player leaves* and he continues stabbing me while i emote hearts at him tauntingly. I forgot about armor or i would've taken it off. Eventually he left after doing nothing but spray my walls with blood and left a glicthed pa suit standing on my porch menacingly to anyone who approached.
---
*(This was next to the Morgantown airport/train station. My home was a treehouse and the level 7 player actually got stuck in the middle where the tree poked through, after I freed him the 120 guy started attacking. I'm around level 35 btw)
---
So far so good, I've been on the same server for almost two hours now and not a single instant "server not responding" disconnect so far.
---
So it seems the hotfix fixed the disconnection issues (whether it was caused by duping or not), can other people confirm this or am I just lucky in this case?
---

See those 20k *ultracite* rounds and how his new screenshot now only has 3k? People called him out.

I had a guy take over my workshop, I went to go do something about it, we shot at each other, we both died.
---
I just went to go do something else, because that's dumb and unfun, left him to the workshop and my junk.
---
He messaged me saying he was still there and just wanted to PvP. I told him I had no interest, as we both have explosive weapons and I don't enjoy it. He asked me to come back so he could give me my junk back and then left the workshop alone
---
Super nice guy. I honestly kinda feel bad. I usually love PvP. I just don't see the point here.
---
They shot first!
---
What group do you suppose would carry out the guard duty they were described doing? I doubt the original developers thought about that detail when creating the story 
---
I don't remember where but I did see 2 ginger snuggles with gas mask doing a breaking bad reference
---
Simply letting you play an instrument anywhere would be an improvement.  There's plenty of opportunities for downtime that could lead to you breaking out an instrument and playing for the buff.  Also.. why not buff people that are nearby as well?
---
You're right, and I edited in a couple of points :)
---
Thank you again man, enjoyed the feedback!
---
Its a very defensible position in my experience even against TSE weapons
---
Hope fuck.
---
Late game is trash kid
---
Yeah, he is our fat boy. 22 pound Norwegian forest cat. Solid black. Can't have kids so he is our boy.
---
XD
---
Agreed, I don't like aliens much. 
---
I played PSO on DC (and why yes, I had the keyboard too ;) ). Duping was even easier and more rampant there, since everything was saved client side. I don't remember a whole lot of hate from those days but PSO was my first outing in the PS universe. I was just happy to play a game online that wasn't on a computer since mine was shit at the time.
---
But yes, there are some similarities.
---
But god, do I miss those visual elements to that game. They were so amazing (especially for that time.) I would love a game to have that look again (Deus Ex managed to get "close" but it wasn't anywhere near the Cyber Tokyo-esque aesthetic. ) 
---
Oh I figured it out haha so I have 3 followers and they made a post from when I thanked someone for gold (before I knew that was a sin apparently) and now just constantly downvote anything I post. I believe it was r/awardspeechedits or some shit like that. Definetly not worried about it. Kids will be kids. Honestly I didn't deserve gold for my comment but they definetly are toxic children. Not worried. 
---
not saying it is, but could be dupers looking for new methods. we know previous duping methods involved crashing the server so it could be supposed that maybe they are experimenting with new ways to crash the server in order to find a new glitch
---
And it's also the first online game BGS has done (Zenimax did ESO iirc), and is built on an engine designed for single player games, so of course there will be some kinks in it, but the dupe exploits in the game rely entirely on server lag and such to work.
---
Ugh, the PKers were rampant in that game. 
---
You can't read, lol.
---
Stays a one star
---
Yes I think this is why this perk is coming out. I think it will improve PvP experience now they just have to get rid of bobblehead exploit
---
I really want them to all start fighting eachother and level up for each kill.
---
 Come to a town and it has a lvl 105 scourched hermit crab ruling it.
---
People said they wanted more communication 
---
And? Thousands of mats? You do realize how fast you can dupe, right? Starting with just 1 you can have 65536 mats with only 16 dupes. If you start with more than one it goes up that much faster. Oh, and you can dupe multiple things at the same time as well. So what you're looking at is maybe an hour to dupe it all. Maybe. Might've taken a lot less time than that if he started with a bunch.
---
Damn Steve 
---
This is lit
---
Blues Brothers should boost for whole party
---
Yeah it is pretty damn annoying. 
---
some of the guys we killed the queen with had TSE miniguns and 50 cal machine guns so the queen went down fast. 
---
Not sure if that had anything to do with the instability, but the amount of TSE weapons are an issue for so many reasons. 
---
I wanted a legit TSE single action revolver, but the influx of them has killed the excitement for me and I almost don't even want it anymore. Just thought it'd be fun to mess around with. 
---
Haha I found most of the holo tapes already so it won't take long to progress through it. Also having 90% of the map unlocked helps alot as well. 
---
I would use this. 
---
Check the area southeast of Relay Tower EL-B1-02. I have encountered the Flatwoods Monster in that area 3 times. 
---
From a lore perspective, we shouldn't be nuking anything but the Queen.
---
From a mechanic perspective, I agree whole heartedly.
---
r/deardiary
---
Not even before widespread duped TSE shotguns.  People die too fast regardless as long as someone has an effective build.
---
There are plenty of workshops to claim. If it's about who claimed it first then I see that as their right. If someone else attacks and loses I don't sympathise with them.
---
Are you? You're title says it still eats your armor.
---
Your first sentence says they still haven't fixed it. 
---
You had to have known it was bugged. 
---
Why does anyone lie? Some guy said he got disconnected 4 times in a minute. Just not possible. Another person said he got disconnected every 15 minutes. When questioned about it, he said he exaggerated, it wasn't that bad, he was just upset. 
---
Or all the nerf claims everytime a patch comes out that turn out to be lies.
---
Or how the stealing from people's inventory while trading turned out to be a lie.
---
Why do I think you lied? Because you're embarrassed this happened when you knew it could happen. Now your claiming you didn't know it was bugged? Isn't THAT a lie?
---
I'm having trouble visualizing this. I would also like to see a few pics. I am camped on a slope and have been having issues with the concrete foundations.
---
Fair enough, but especially with the current duping method, it apparently crashes the server. So if you drop the items and the server crashes... Those are now gone for good
---
yeah, but you would still need to time it right or maybe just play the RNG game and hope it rolls back far enough for the dupe to work. Today's patch  Addressed an issue with workshops that could cause server instability. Maybe there was an exploit involved with the workshop that caused a guaranteed roll back.
---
Seperate character &amp; re uploaded because I got so much hate over nothing - I have a handmade commando build (as I’ve already explained) and have already explained how to get ultra ammo for cheap. 
---
Did you fail police academy and resorting to try to “call out”’people on Reddit. Serious no lifer right here 👍🏼
---
Yeah, saw the deathclaw bugged the first time, have a screenshot I took of it confused. Figured it out a couple of weeks later.
---
Wooby is definitely just for the test cell man. I've messed around in these rooms Bethesda made in their singleplayer games all the time. They were identical back in Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 4, all of them have an NPC standing or walking around. I imagine devs use that room to apply interaction scripts and such to something you can talk to or buy from. 0% chance of it being game relevant in the slightest.
---
Cool that a silly ass name of an NPC gets people excited though. Think it'll be a really cool moment when they do move the story forward with whatever it is.
---
You can mod it though.
---
Most likely the recent instability was purely this workshop thing and had nothing to do with duping. The only reports of duping were from that one dude with 0 evidence.
---
Cowboy hat doesnt look as cool as i thought
---
Hey actually it turns out thw anti armor tambo is unarmed u want it ?
---
I think you can remake it at the fabricator in the Order bunker.
---
Another Player Oven fan here! Showed all my friends your video, you are no doubt a celebrity amongst the sub. 
---
Nah bro you are just a juvenile bitch ruining the game for others. Hoping to find you in game. Good Luck!
---
Ive got a medic 10mm pistol which is nice for a critspammer build
---
Unfortunately there is not. I have my soup favorited for hotkey access. 
---
In the same area where you found the first one. Stay along the river just outside the facility, and look near trees, roots/vines, and rocks. Use Green Thumb perk for best results!
---
(They glow, so it's easier at night to find them)
---
Think of it this way, what you're looting is the stuff worth saving.  IOW, unequipped stuff in their inventory.  You can't take the weapons they were using against you because those have cooties.
---
I agree, this is likely going to all be the realm of fanfic. 
---
Let me read up on the existing lore a bit before offering an opinion there
---
Honestly I don't think it's really meant to be a Zetan. It generally spawns far away and to disappear whenever it gets engaged in combat. That makes it seem like Bethesda really didn't want you to see it up close.
---
If I were to guess the Zetans were not being used in FO76 and when it came time to do the flatwoods monster the devs and artists just decided it'd be easier to stick an existing race into a new "suit" instead of creating a whole new race with different looks, attributes, AND a suit on it.
---
This is probably why we see the inclusion of the helmet and differing color on the body of the Zetan. Because it's not supposed to be one.
---
Many A True Nerd also for ALL other things Fallout 
---
theres only one way I know of to add an additional star and that would be the scorched killer mod. you cannot affix any other legendary effects
---
I noticed last night before the patch that it wasn't recognizing the mats in my stash at my camp, I had to pull my lead/steel/gunpowder out of my stash to craft some .45 ammo.
---
i mean he might have meant it to just be whipped cream...
---
Grammar Nazis have modernized to make it easier to be accepted in modern culture. 
---
They’re called the Alt Write now.
---
I've had that but it was only a couple hundred
---
difference is there can't be another Queen immediately after we kill the first one, i'm not entirely sure on her respawn timer but it's not an event that can just continuously be done back to back. 
---
so in the time between she "resets" is the time i'd like to see the change, not a permanent thing of course. 
---
I'm pretty sure it has been posted before, but nonetheless it's still a cool reference
---
If you are on PC, I have spares. I religiously look for them at every vendor I stop at, along with any other quest items people have sold, in case I can help. That's how I got my Mistress of Mystery items back. I am on PC, username HOBOTHULHU
---
Got a lot of info from this post, so I'll share what I know! I'm at work so I'll try to be as detailed but no promises.
---
Lead: Missle Silos. The gyms at Charleston and Flatwoods dont compare to the massive amounys of lead in here. Be ready to walk carrying a ton of shit. Also, Ski Valley and Top of the World have tons of cans on a string. Dont forget to check for paint cans (3) next to Free States Vendor Robot.
---
Screws: Nearby West Tek is a satellite array building with almost 8 fans? Sure, Sugar Springs is nice but its farmed to death. Deal with the muties, and collect your typewriters and desk fans galore. And telephones for circuits.
---
Springs: Flooded Trainyard. Those mutated bears that sound like 'yeah guy' spawn hella there. 5 springs each, plus acid.
---
Aluminum: Watoga High School and Fort Defiance. Pick up EVERY surgical tray for (1) and TV Dinner for (2). Aluminum ezpz
---
Steel: Complete a circuit of West Tek, plus the nearby array and warehouse. An INSANE amount of mutants there, and plenty of workshops to scrap. Use the plastic from the laser weapons to bulk as well.
---
Gears: Farm Deathclaws. Find them in Deathclaw Island, the Enclave Base Cave, the cave that looks like a face in the Savage Divide, and a substation in the Cranberry Marsh. Good source of Stimpacks and Black Titanium.
---
Plastic: Watoga High. Dont forget to pick up lead in the paint cans at the art room. 'Nothing is real!'
---
Wood: Equip Woodchucker(?) Perk for double wood, and run around between Vault 76 and the Lumberyard. Easily 600 - 1000 wood. 
---
Helpful Tips: 
---
Healing: Don't rely solely on Stimpacks. I tried crafting them bulk, and purified water was too slow. Use Healing Salves, crafted with bloodleaf and soot flowers. Collect around Vault 76 and the Overseers Camp for Soot Flowers, and follow the River towards Mothman Museum(?) For Bloodleaf. 30 min of gathering easily gets 120 of each. Craft with Chemist (double), and Super Duper (Chance of another double?). Made 300 of these that heal 20% instantly and don't degrade.
---
EXP: Complete the West Tek circuit I mentioned for Steel. Not only do you get great steel, chances at Legendaries, almost every mod for laser rifles, assault rifles, and hunting rifles from scrapping, bulk rubber from scrapping to use as vendor trash, gunpowder, plastic, frag grenades and convenient workbenches BUT there is something else. Go up the roof through the stairs at the back, and find a little alcove to jump through right next to a square toolbox. You'll find a can of paint. BUT THATS NOT ALL. Take a look to your right and jump into the segment next to it for 8(?) Paint cans, paintbrushes, etc and jump towards the lawnchair for 2 more AND A PERFECTLY PRESERVED PIE. 
---
West Tek is love. West Tek is life
---
If you have any suggestions or want to know another place for anything I didnt mention, let me know!
---
Thx for the replies. Modding doesn't change it much in terms of damage (somewhere in the 30's). Well at least I can stop trying. :)
---
The point of PVP is to get some quick caps and random assorted junk.  Only reason I have my jetpack is because one guy I killed had a bunch of stable flux on him.  
---
I've got a few nice pieces of armour from legendaries there, no TSE Gatling Gun (which would be very probably my dream weapon)
---
Honestly, things are starting to look up for the game, compared to a month or even a couple weeks ago things seem to generally be heading in a positive direction.
---
Considering someone can just walk up to your workshop click the button and instantly one shot you, they have total control of that situation. There's something off about that. You set up a lot of defenses and then they get to choose the exact moment to initiate PvP, and until then you can't do anything about it. That's my complaint with the system.
---
You can mod it and, if you have the weapon repair perk cards, you can repair them up to 200%.  But you can’t change the star. 
---
Guy said he was getting 30fps on a newer system than mine. I was pointing out if am getting 70fps at 1440 on ultra, on a lower card and older CPU, then it's not the game that is his issue but possibly his system. 
---
I got 25 off of a ghoul the other day.
---
Thanks rng
---
Of course! I was dressed as a "chef" the other day, chasing an opossum with a pitchfork hollering, "YUM! YUM! EAT'EM UP!"
---
You can mess with the settings on the Xbox and in the actual game.
---
I have something similar. My home is near a a semi popular lower level area, purposely set it up because  I can meet new players and help the newbies.
---
Well when was level 10  see a couple of high levels, 70s or 80s I think, in the area and I'm thinking cool, let's meet them.
---
I head down into the area and say hello.
---
They immediately start attacking me, completely unproked and kill me. 
---
I try to explain, hey I was just saying hi and offering to help kill the Scorched there as I respawn but they kill me again immedtly. 
---
I give up and respawn back at my camp, but  a minute later they are at my camp with two more friends of their friends, lvl 100s.
---
I'm like, hey come on, I'm not looking for a fight, but they all start trying to attack me. 
---
I run inside my house, locking the door and they start attacking my house.
---
I try to shoot out through the windows and tossing grenades  from the second floor just to get them to back off but they are destroying my walls.
---
I fix them but one pick locks my door and kills me. I respawn in my house and they are  still attacking.
---
Finally out of pure desperation, I'm am forced to sever jump but the poor damage on my house was done and it was allot to repair. Worst PVP experience yet in this game.
---
I like the fishermans overalls and the mailman outfits
---
What's your luck? Pretty sure that affects the condition of looted gear. I frequently pick up weapons that have over 100% condition.
---
I'd agree with that.... I don't even do nuke zones yet but since the patch what I have noticed is this new thing of crashing to desktop all of a sudden.  Never had crashing to desktop before in the game. Disconnects, server instability, lag, all kinds of trouble pretty frequently but never just sudden crash to desktop. But I've had it happen about six or seven times since the patch.
---
Said everyone who uses this sub are pussies
---
I really need to buy the letters so I can make a free candy death house

What is there even to gain except for a bounty by destroying homes? :/

Damn that's my dream TSE weapon (that or the single action).  Always been a fan of pistols that pack a punch.  Seems like a lot of fun. 
---
That’s a rather middle school insult isn’t it
---
 My low level alt started running around Watoga at level 14. He's level 24 now and does business there every day. He has good Leather Armor that makes all the robots, outside of Assultrons and big chain gun guys, ignoreable. ;)
---
 The Protectrons don't do much damage amd the Eyebots are one shot. He gets in fights to free up the BOS bot and does just fine.
---
 He will finish the BOS initial quests soon and we are waiting for level 25 when we get to use some much better weapons. Is that a Lever Gun in my stash .. yes it is. ;)
---
 My other is a level 55 Enclave person who has done the Major quest, and they leave her alone.
---
 Heavy Leather is very strong against Energy weapons. 
---
You are continuing to dig a deeper hole lmao. You can strafe-walk and jump away. You can run towards them and jump over them. This works even better when you are not wearing power armor. Floating around in your jetpack makes you an easy target. Jumping, shooting/swinging/stabbing and running around like a madman certainly does not.
---
You keep repeating how your sense of 'skill' is walking backwards and firing TSE shots against an attacker. And then you complain about PA stimpack spam.
---
Like I said, you'll have a lot of catching up to do when fireproof is updated :)
---
I've seen so many threads where you talk about "messaging the player", but can I ask if this means voice chat, or are you using the text chat mod? I'm considering downloading it, but I don't know if there's any people on it :)
---
noticed that myself, but I can craft them so didn't really affect me.
---
It makes the bat aluminum, decreasing it's weight, and increasing it's damage.  It's alot like all other mods, just scrap a boat load of bats and odds are you'll unlock it.
---
Since hot patch I've CTD and DC'd a few times.
---
Didn't happen this much to me after the actual patch.
---
Jesus. 
---
Is this okay to do? I'm level 52 and done a few WS nuke zones but have intentionally stayed away from SBQ bc i heard that the more people that show up the harder she gets to kill. I would happily show up and just crush trash mobs the whole time if that's something that is acceptable.
---
Sorry to be a pain, but I'm an idiot.
---
I have a level 25 (lowest damage possible) 50cal with 50% armour pen. I also have 45% armour pen from the perk.
---
Am I better using that against high level enemies, or am I better just going and making a stock standard level 45 50cal.
---
Yes, but my point is, if there is 24 item stashes all over the place, why should matter how much items is in them? If it would matter, player loading 25th place with 50k items should INSTANTLY crash the server. Thats how i personaly see it.
---
The person who took the workshop actually has total control because they CHOSE to take the workshop.  Without that it would be normal consent based PVP.  
---
They're missing several instrumnents, the first that comes to mind is the mouth harp. You can find these in the wild however can't build them at your camp
---
good on you brother, enjoy your perceived ban  /s
---
now if we can just get rid of the actual cheaters who grief people it'd be a party.
---
In the medical center there is a jangles the moon monkey with a toy alien stuck to it's face. Like the face hugger  from Alien.
---
I’ve found a vampire 10mm before.
---
With the patch out for PC players I have a question. I always found 5-6 legendary ghouls in white springs when nuked. Even though they nerfed the XP would white springs still be the best place to farm legendaries after the patch? 
---
Upvote for your reply 
---
I mean....there are plenty of moonshine shacks so this isn't far fetched, what were you trying to get in particular?
---
Agreed. I completed Mayor for a day at lvl 20 with a pipe revolver you can do it. As I always say,"If you can't beat em run from them"
---
I do actually,  I was smart for once
---
I just came on to rajr and found this post. It just seems like I have a freaking beacon attached to me that brtings scorch beasts at me every 20 seconds. I'm trying to get some exploring done in the savage divide and cranberry bog (and I get that is where they spawn.)  But if I see one, I book it in the other direction. But now, every time I find a place, a Scorchbeast spawns on my head to rape my ass with an army of Scorched
---
As awesome as that would be. I think maybe people might exploit said idea with explicit photos or messages or something. I could see it turning into something bad.

Brilliant idea but kudos

Nice :) 👍

I'd seen pretry old posts about the duster not matching the pics in the shop, but assumed that would get taken care of after someone else brought it up...nope
---
Just a bit disapointed in how it turned out, pretty plain
---
Just south east of the cave where you start the enclave mission. I found a lvl 91 irradiated deathclaws stalking it, once you go into the tree there are about 8 lvl 50-60 cave crickets. 
---
Mostly like 280 of bulk and a lot of rare items and screws and that junk
---
Did you go out an immediately buy a lottery ticket? 
---
Yup hahah, classic troll
---
Know how to get the plans for it? 
---
Which vendor?
---
It really should've just been a dropin and out co-op game instead of trying to be an always online shard server game imho.
---
Huh. Interesting. Thanks.
---
There's a problem with that. How do you identify duped items? If you stack 100 duped screws on top of 300 legit screws, then you just have 400 screws. The game makes no difference between duped and not. Each and every instance of an item in the game doesn't have its own unique identifier. Maybe I have 800 screws that I found. Maybe I have 800 screws I bought off another player who obtained them correctly. Maybe I have 800 screws that I bought off of a duper. Bethesda has no way of knowing which are which. If I've been duped into buying duped items (ha) do I get my caps back when the items disappear, or am I just punished for trading with other players?  
---
"Leave all duped items in their inventory as items that can't be used, sold, or dropped. Break their over-encumbered backs..." You do realize most dupers have multiple accounts, right? Especially if they're raiding the dev room. You think they care about an account being made useless? If they can make more than the cost of the game from the duped items they'll never bother to stop and care if they lose one. Oh, and if they're looking to invest, you can get keys from resellers in batches of 100 at a time. Create the 100 accounts, and bam, you have enough that if one or 50 get banned, who cares? If you can make more than $35 off of each character (should be pretty easy) then you're running a net profit.
---
I've done it. OP needs the encouragement.
---
Damn that would be cool. For sure. 
---
wish I could cook in your oven... wink wink... say no more...
---
You sir, are onto something.
---
The rare cryptids should have custom loot tables, stuff there's no chance of getting from any other creature even other rare ones, it should be tailored to the individual cryptid.
---
Hehe I did
---
ty i use my found mutants exploding shotgun as my main but i keep this since its my only TSE find
---
Wanna send some GTs? Might need to deliver wasteland justice.
---
A level 38 was leveling camps near his and bullying others off the server because his camp wouldn't load in. He also decided to fuck with my workshop.
---
His camp got leveled.
---
Then a high level tried to white knight for the baby and ended up leaving the server ~1000 caps poorer because our team was stronger. Towards the end they decided cloaking was the only way to get the occasional kill.
---
It's mostly one hit kills. VATS/Crit is pretty much king. Melee is only good if you use the slap system to your advantage. Workshop fights have no limits and often turn into battles of attrition. Sometimes people simply stand around for an hour waiting for you to leave and there's no way to kick them out(super fucking lame). Balance is pretty much non-existent, TTK is way too short. Having said that, I have had fun experiences. Mostly when my team is doing the rolling or when the fight does feel coincidentally balanced. But overall, be prepared for some bullshit. It's far from being in a good place
---
My point is give us the option to decide upfront if we want to enter the world having to replace our C.A.M.P.   Right now we click OK that it cant be placed, then have to bring up the map, hit LB, then hit leave world.   Wouldn’t it be easier if they said. Your C.A.M.P. Can’t be placed, do you want to join another world, with a yes or no choice.  Possibly make it a player setting so you never enter a world where your C.A.M.P. Is not able to be placed. 
---
Right now when prompted your camp cant be placed and you can move it for free I bet most players click ok, then exit and rejoin.  
---
While it is simple, it’s annoying to start a game only to find out you have to restart a game. 
---
Grahm
---
Considering he splash damage you with what looks like an explosive shotgun I would say he is in pacifist mode. 
---
you can do a search here or google for "Fallout 76 custom .ini file." It can improve the graphics by taking out things like gaussian blur and other things that PC folks find look a bit ugly and can cause motion sickness. Simple to do, but not a "mod" per se. 
---
The attacker walks into the workshop virtually invulnerable. They have total control of when to initiate pvp. They click the button and one shot the person whenever they choose. That is total control of the situation.
---
They're on console, using their respective online messaging systems (PS4/Xbox can direct message players separate from the game itself).
---
You’ll shoot your eye out!
---
It is mine.
---
I am jealous.
---
Lol
---
I like this, being a home brewer myself this would be awesome.
---
I've been making a habit of travelling to low-level players when I have an abundance of chems, ammo and plans/recipes I don't need to drop it for them.  Random acts of kindness and all.   Thankfully I haven't been murdered for it yet by angry vigilante griefers.
---
Step 1.5: exit the vault ;)
---
General consensus on this subreddit is to bash the game because of this. It was a manufactured controversy that had nothing to do with FO76. Not calling it your opinion specifically. 
---
3k isn't even that much, you can make twice as much in a single nuke run with super duper and green thumb
---
I believe they patched it in one of the December patches, around the time that the weight exploit got patched. I used to get the same kind of lag that you are talking about after having like 900+ pounds of items on me when farming a nuke zone and ever since that patch everything now loads almost instantly for me. I haven't had the slow load thing since. I haven't tested trading though.
---
I’d take the bpp, won’t be on till tomorrow night though
---
Probably xbone/ps4 msg systems. 
---
Most likely a duper but who knows
---
I doubt it be a storage account with level 15
---
Ahhh! OK that makes sense.
---
Still though, anyone tried the PC text chat mod? :)
---
Thats what they said, but it was never implemented 
---
I suppose it could also be that now everyone isn't walking around with 2k pounds of stuff that doesnt weight them down though, like the pocketed glitch caused.
---
Ohh lit! Time to investigate!
---
Rollbacks are  a technical issue, cause FO76 does not save your progress timely. So you basically have a minor or lesser rollback, whenever you log in after a disconnect. The disconnect itself causes the rollbacks depending on the timegap between the last progression save and the disconnect.
---
Had damn near the same thing happen to me on PS4. Except it was my little brick house, I'm lvl 57, and I didn't accept their invite, they just showed up. 
---
The vampire outfit I accidentally bought after pressing Enter twice :/
---
Need a damn confirmation menu.
---
Buffing anyone nearby was my initial thought, but it might be weird if you buffed someone that was about to attack you. Maybe if they made it so the buff is removed if you enter PVP?
---
I... Think your logic is flawed, but it doesn't sound like there's any hope of convincing you otherwise.
---
Harpers ferry has alot of plans like that
---
Are you on ps4? I'll pay you or trade for a full set mate.
---
Prime = +25% damage to scorched scorch beasts and the scorch queen  
---
Scorched is also a prefix like glowing so those also take the extra damage.   
---
Ultracite laser weapons have a built in +25% acting like a prime and does stack with the prime receiver.   
---
Ultracite PA is still being looked into but does seem to take less damage from all scorched types. 
---
I play the game as it was designed. I play by the rules. Take it up with Todd or play something else
---
Awesome. Thanks man.
---
oooh another good find. 
---
I use a two shot lever action and an instigating deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
Still haven't found an explosive weapon of any kind. My luck it'll be a level 35 flamer when I do though lol. 
---
I enjoy PvP but when I lose I lose, I cant get upset if someone kills me when I was trying to do the same, sounds like a grade A salty asshole
---
Anyone knows the name of the plan? 
---
I can't even experience the dark side ending of the KoToR series first hand since I can't be evil, even in games. I can't do it in this game, but I seem to have no problems with retaliation. 
---
Considering server instability is a crucial part of duping, how not?
---
Gotcha. Thanks 
---
@narrator69 I believe that is the most likely scenario if there were a dupe glitch right now. I think that it is very fair to say that they are widely using dupes as a scapegoat as well. I think duping is breaking the game but I also truly believe that the game is not stable without duping or any exploit. 
---
A prime weapon is a weapon that has been fitted with a prime receiver. You can get prime receivers from drops most commonly from the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
Prime receivers do additional damage to scorched and do not have the penalty against non-scorched like the Scorch Killer Receivers do.
---
They require Ultracite ammo which is kind of expensive material-wise to craft, so definitely not a "daily driver" unless you just want to burn up a whole lot of flux for no good reason. :)
---
I did one of those too but more of an aerial shot.
---
The shot makes it look like the two had mortally wounded each other and they were reconciling with their dying breath.
---
Funny now in a sad way. That's what I thought going in and found out that far from the truth.
---
Nah I wanna take it up with you. Hide while you can.
---
They are probably on console, they have more options for communications than PC players. Which is both a blessing and a curse.
---
I need to find people...... I dont have a mic i am not shy but i just dont like to talk. I just want to play dont even have to do the same quests but just for joining.
---
Mcellov is my pc gamer tag. Feel free to add me
---
Gatling Laser is better at the moment it feels like..
---
It will open on the chest eventually? Even if you do not scrap ultra light chest piece? That's how it works? Interesting.
---
Griefers are griefers because it makes them feel powerful, somehow, to pick on people who aren't as strong as them. When that is taken from them, they can't handle it, and it makes them ragey. Pretty much a lot of humans in a nutshell.
---
So basically Prime Weapons do more damage to scorched and are better than normal weapons, whilst ultracite do more damage than prime weapons and are better than prime?
---
Holy shit. The holy grail. At level 74 I still have yet to find a single TSE weapon!!!
---
I can make you a suit. GT: XxSoLiDSnAkEOxX
---
I don't think you can dupe legendary weapons. 
---
Yeah I saw for sale at vendor once 
---
It's okay to disagree man, the fact is, the player Stash was active when he accesed a Dev-Room, and it was on live servers because there is no private servers. So yes, having many items on many places could be performance heavy. But if the ammount of items in a stash mattered, the Dev-Room (Again) would crash a server after loading it. Because it would be 25th place with huge ammout of items, possibly even more then whole server with full stashes combined. That's how i see it. 
---
It’s from the dev room
---
I had a Mega Sloth lvl 20 at my camp, accidentally tamed him, now he has disappeared but I have 10% stored in camp budget with nothing in the stored tab. I have server hopped, rebooted the launcher, verified files, cleared cache and re-installed the game and it still persists. Please give us some way to delete/dismiss/kill a tamed critter, especially since they aggro on friends and team members.
---
Also please make cats and such tameable, would love to have a bunch of those cool frogs hang out in my camp, with a cat.
---
Just watched all of your videos.  Those are great, well done.  (just like your victims) 
---
The duping problem on the front page doesn't exist, it's a troll trying to exploit the fact that the update caused instability in order to fearmonger. I say trying, although it clearly worked lol
---
Can I pay you or trade for a chest piece?
---
That’s what most dipping is exactly about.
---
I believe it is Powered Doors
---
That last payment is a doosie!
---
Xbox One Messenger
---
Not even that hard to get. It's the steel.
---
Absolute legend. State your price brother
---
Why would they need to add the dev room back? That makes no sense at all. You have 2 different versions of the game. Retail/dev. Retail is identical to dev, minus the dev room. You don't have to do the dev work on the retail version of the game anyhow. They do dev work on the dev version, test compatibility with retail (which is just a computer they have with the retail game installed), then release to public. 
---
As for using godmode, you don't have to constantly look up and type codes. http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Game_Master Funny how you can make accounts invulnerable when you're the developer.
---
Leave the room in a place that can't be accessed? Like in Fallout 76? Right? Protip: If it's not there they can't find it.
---
Glad you were there to balance the scales. Question though - you say 'Messaged you'... Did he track you down on Reddit just to accuse you of hacking? Or is there some secret Discord channel that everyone hangs out in?
---
Not really, the countless amounts of TSE weapons makes me kinda terrified to pvp. I just stand at my counter and wave, hoping it's a normal person needing some chems. 
---
Shit. Noted man! Got to be careful with any Bethesda product haha.
---
seriously??? Can I be banned for it? Should I contact the support?
---
I've found a legendary 10mm of a mongrel horde event thing before.  Unfortunately it was low level 2 shot
---
To get the bonus you have to wear the dress and the eye together so you can’t wear other armors with it. 
---
If it makes you feel any better dude my findings have been crap too (lvl 112) I got this as part of a trade with a dude who wanted bloody god roll gear.
---
That is actually where my husband got the nickname. He is huge and he steals everything. You have it, he wants it. 
---
I've looked into the same thing recently. Looks like it's got a few metal bits, but is mostly plastic.
---
None
---
That circle around the workshop console should be PvP flagged. Anyone who steps into that circle whether they click the button or not should be flagged for PvP immediately.
---
&gt;then take out the scorched, cave crickets, wendigos, and yao guai while higher levels can take out the queen. 
---
Exactly this. I hate dealing with adds when a bunch of people are just chilling in the barn. 
---
Grab a shotgun and get Rank 3 enforcer. Aim for legs. Allow higher levels to melee if you can't get them down. Rinse &amp; Repeat. 
---
You should be fine but whoever got it probably is banned now
---
If you get bring me the materials, I'll do it for 100 caps. I'll be on at like 9:30 U.S. Eastern time.
---
This is a cool idea! I’ll have to check it out. I’ve started dropping a legendary for every low level person I come across to pay it forward. 
---
Plastic mainly 
---
Well written, logical plea for sanity.  Upvoted.
---
3 weeks of BoS event farming on the last two days I never looked at my plans and when I did it was in there but I know for a fact it never popped on screen. So I tell myself I must have just gotten it and not wasted hours farming those two days.
---
like, IRL or in game?
---
She had 6538 flux of every type and A LOT OF Ultracite. 
---
BTW Is It Right To Get a Legendary Weapon From the duper? 
---
Like it was with everything else as well...  Did she mean to drop it? 
---
I concur. Not necessarily what we spent making it, but maybe a portion of it (due to damages by dismantling). 
---
In regards to banning duppers (as I keep seeing people suggesting this instead of just fixing the issue itself). In my experience, people that cheat, dupe, etc. will just make a new psn subscription, buy plus on it, and continue playing. I knew a guy in my tribe in ark on pc before that got caught using an app that showed him where every dinosaur was and what level they were. He got banned and then just made a new account on steam, bought the game again, and continued to play the game. For instance, I wouldn't be surprised if those guys that chased around that player shaming him and got banned for it don't already have new accounts and are still playing. Just look at that Tyler 1 dude. They legit couldn't stop him, every time they banned him he just made a new account to the point that they just legit gave up.  
---
So in other words it just turns into wack a mole, patching the exploit is usually the best way to stop it and requires the least time investment versus chasing players around.
---
and on top of that they are nerfing nuke xp your better off just sever hoping normal white springs 
---
Make the adds having a higher aggro on sub-50 players. They can either get busy livin' or get busy dying. 
---
Did we ever get that one update for the last one on Xbox?
---
You scrap armor to get mods... lots of armor 
---
By chance did either of you own a Workshop somewhere in the world when this occurred?
---
&gt; Sorry if this has already been posted.
---
I mean, reddit's search function isn't great, [but 2 seconds could have answered that for you.](https://imgur.com/F7Fdrcv.png)
---
i’m in the U.K. so this may be tricky, will probably be best to do it on the weekend?
---
It's a storeroom with a Nuka Quantum, various junk items, and shielded lining plans for the Enclave underarmor. No idea if said plans change from server to server.
---
Thank you! This was exactly the kind of feed back I was hoping for. I was unaware that Dodgy, Adamantium skeleton, and Serendipity didn't work in power armor. I had not thought about the party aspect of suppressor and tenderizer. Which most of the time I am solo. Refractor I had taken as a suggestion from a friend but I had also noticed that it didn't seem to make too much difference in power armor. I use born survivor because I play on Xbox and it's just easier than have to stop fighting to use a stimpak. Also it skips the motion of using the stimpak and just instantly starts. Though I do agree that 3 points in it is a bit much and I reduced to 2. I did update my build and removed perks that don't work in power armor. I did look at your build as well and took some of your ideas. I wasn't sure if you knew though that marathoner does not work in power armor. Thanks for the advice!
---
Tattoos
---
Why on the forehead only? Why not give us preset on cheeks, side neck, etc?
---
Do we have the same wife? 
---
Or when they actually use the correct weapon, but it’s a flamer that they’re beating you to death with instead of firing at you.
---
I don't believe so. Just scorched enemies and (i think) scorched variants of enemies. 
---
The prime receivers are really meant for the Queen. 
---
I kinda figured it must have, but I had never seen it. Maybe it'll fall upon some new eyes with this post. I was pretty psyched when I found it!
---
I don't like the durability on either... but with bear arms the plasma only weighs 2 pounds. That and it doesn't use my power armor's fuel.
---
nice specs dude, I'd sell a testicle to have that machine. Mines a 6300, 16g 1866MHz ram with a 1050 2G in a pcie 2.0. Canada sucks for component pricing, way beyond exchange values.
---
Thanks for the replies all. Good to know they're out there. I'll keep searching while  dropping boxing gloves and wood armor bits all over Appalachia. 
---
Good to know, thanks buddy!
---
Known bug, if you swap back to a weapon that has just broken in an area with high lag like the SBQ fight it'll bug out and be infinite till you put it away again. 
---
I had two encounters that were entertaining. First was when I was like lvl 20 right after I got my excavator PA .  
---
I was just rolling around and some random dude started shooting at me. I walked up to him and pulled out my super sledge. He kept shooting me while I was standing there for like 5 seconds to make sure he seen my weapon... then I hit him 4 times and killed him(he was like lvl 50 in his own PA). Then he came back with a friend that had a Gatling gun and power armor that was even higher level. Proceeded to kill them both like 10 times each before they backed off and we all went our separate ways.  
---
2nd time I had fun... went to use the stash at a workshop and there were 3 guys standing around. Dropped my junk off and noticed one guy was standing there shooting at me... so again I pulled out my super sledge and let him shoot me for a few seconds before I put him down. His buddy’s were just standing there and I didn’t even loot dudes body. After he got back his buddy started shooting me also and so I went over to him and put him down then snagged his 100 lb of junk and started running away... not before I quick stashed all his junk(was overweight with it) and kept running. So these 3 guys all like double my level stated the chase. I would run a bit then hid behind a tree. As soon as one reached me I would kill that one then run some more. As I would run past cars I would give them one hit and keep running. Think I killed like 2 of them with this tactic. Just kept running, ended up running half way across the map. Took a time out to kill a Giant Sloth in the middle, they were still pot shooting at me but were more focused on the sloth. Then ended up getting killed after about 25 minutes of running around the map. Went and had a smoke and they were still camping my body for dudes junk that I snagged but that was already in my stash from the beginning of the chase... oh yeah only 2 of them were wearing PA so when the guy without it caught up to me he would die in 2 hits instead of the 4 or 5 it would take to kill the PA users. 
---
Level 41 and in the same boat, I've done some pretty far along quests in the story as the sidekick to other players but haven't done it myself. However, I have seen pretty much the entire map. I spend most of my time walking around, trying to interact with other players, and punching the ever-loving shit out of everything with my power fist. That's really all I need
---
Wednesday or Sunday will be fine. I'll message you the components tonight, also I love Ultracite and T-51 so I'm all for seeing less people in X0-1. 
---
I personally would not be furious over a player wipe. 
---
It would have to come with a few caveats though.
---
1) Duppers would be permanent banned. 
---
2) It included a full suite of weapon balancing.
---
3) Wiped players received some in game compensation. 
---
found same and was wondering if i break it down should i expect to learn this paint job? I am hesitant to do ..
---
Took me until L138 to see my first one. In a blast zone. In the middle of a sundew forest. Scared the living shit out of me to say the least seeing as I’d given up hope of ever seeing one. Hang in there pal!
---
Bro dude. Take all the parts off the basis and trade the individual pieces. The. Drop the chassis. 
---
Ive played over 450 hours and havent gotten a single tse gun. I have however came across 11 two shot guns, and 5 explosive guns but never a tse.
---
@52, come and handle adds.   this enables the the big guns get her down on the ground.
---
iirc I unlocked it by scrapping bats for wood (cause you use alot of wood when you make up 200-300 boiled water at a time for the purposes of stockpiling teas/foods
---
Noup 100% sure, just prime receivers 
---
Ultracite lasers are better than normal lasers versus scorched, while a primed ultracite laser does the most. 
---
On a wooden security check point where the is a weapons workbench next to a corpse lying over barrier.
---
Half a months wages for something ok, or take the back route where people are trying to provide people with what they can.
---
75 dollar TSE bundles, and free drops. Yup. Nice.
---
Its a known glitch caused by selecting a weapon that just broke from the favorites wheel. If you switch weapons now you wont be able to re-equip it until it has been repaired.
---
Armor mods are either learned by scrapping or from plans. Polymer materials for Combat Armor are from scrapping Combat Armor pieces. You have to learn the materials like Polymer from scrapping, but the BOS material (the best one for Combat Armor) is learned through plans from Grafton. You have to learn Polymer three times: once for Arms, once for Legs, and once for Torso. Unfortunately, when one unlocks, it doesn't tell you which slot you unlocked so you just have to test modding the material to see which one unlocked.
---
"This game is dying" lol.
---
Just posted about my team getting griefed last night. It was my first experience so far and it totally sucked, wasted 45 mins and soured the mood.
---
Thought that might have been the case. Thanks for the reply!
---
Yeah that was my other issue with the dress. I was surprised when it stripped all my other armor off!
---
As said, mostly plastic, with some metal parts (buckles, screws, etc)
---
My only real PVP experience in this game, I think I was about L 5x and fought a L 20 and L 30 over a workshop.  The fight lasted for about 10 minutes and I was barely able to kill the L 20 once and almost died multiple times.  
---
I know they want to prevent griefing, but in any other MMO this fight would have lasted about 30 seconds with the two lower level chars dead.
---
I'm saying with the right build, you essentially don't need stims.
---
that’s what i’m using atm haha, i’ve got t60 and the excavator PA but i wanna get my hands on the ultracite again after i was robbed by bethesda. imma need to farm these resources lmao 
---
&gt; How could you forget the most important thing? - The leak of personal information of many many people. 
---
Of course! That too.
---
See, so many. I only remembered the Atom store ones after posting the comment. I'm sure that there's more still but the point was made I think.
---
Either way i dont care because it is just a video game
---
Take a look at Lucky Hole with excavator. You can easily net over 1000 Lead there.
---
I use the perk card Super Duper when I craft, so I down voted. Have a nice life.
---
also sunday works for me, every busy atm with exams and i’ve got a fight coming up so weekdays aren’t ideal 
---
You have 600 pounds of storage and outfits are .1 apiece. Your outfit collection wasn't the problem.
---
The next cinematic movie coming out late this year!
---
sbq?
---
No thanks, it probably smells like cheese
---
*shivers* 
---
Yeah but atm I don't know If I should scrap it or report it to Bethesda. I mean this way people can enter to take items and trade on their main.
---
Or you could have done a server hop...
---
Where does it seem like he's lying there? If anything is ok proof of it not being a dupe its that its not in the common dupe pool. I've got an explosive shotgun with executioners, I've had people being weird seeing if I was a duper, and I always got a thumbs up.
---
Whoever you got that from did an amazing job. That is awesome and something Bethesda should have done.
---
I only recently learned that gunpowder is heavy af. Tried using us as much as I could in light ammo.
---
One word: Cannibal.
---
Don’t google clown cream pie.
---
I'm so down! I already do this by myself! Making frequent trips to flatwoods and dropping all my hoarded stimpaks and even going so far as to craft low level weapons ( 5 - 15) with the best mods on it and giving them ammo so they start off with a really happy and good experience :)
---
Just yesterday there was a level 13 and I dropped them 130 stimpaks (no I'm not a duper, I'm a tick farmer with the chemist perk. Even made a second file just to hold my stims) and they followed me around for a half hour giving me the heart emote and even dropping the singular bobblehead head they had as thanks. It was so sweet :) 
---
One I gave a bunch of plans that I had on me which I had already learned and they were so happy they invited me to team up.
---
I must be living under a rock, I'm lvl 132 and only encountered this last night. Thanks for the reply
---
Gauss rifle would be the other, handmade does not do the same damage but at least 30% less no matter the build compared to the Lever.  I use both the handmade and lever and prefer the Lever cause I can kill stuff faster with it.  Both have all the same mods and legendary effects.  The Guass rifle is stronger but has a much lower reload speed thats why it really isnt used much at all.  The reload speed negates whatever damage it does.
---
In real life. I'll try to attach a picture. 
---
It's complicated. It can be worked out but I'd need to know your damage with both weapons, which depends on your perks &amp; weapon mods.
---
As a general rule, base damage makes the largest difference. Probably using the lvl 45 weapon will be better.
---
This is a great idea!  You should also pick up hitchhikers IRL whenver you get a chance. Most of them aren’t looking to wear your skin as a jacket!
---
The gow map is awesome and the rocket sign and the rocket bed. A couple out fits and paints, but mostley stick to the camp stuff.

I found a Jar of Royal Jelly on the Road to Janet's ice Cream - female skeleton fallen off of a bicycle in the road had Royal Jelly under her.

This is pretty crazy old news that doesn't deserve clicks.

MATN or Camelworks.

you my friend are a mad genesis!

Happy cake day

Who the hell downvotes that. I see multiple people asking about being able to see the atoms shop on their phone so they don't miss something
---
Or they are using shotguns on you, then you loot some lame .38's only.
---
\&gt; "War. War never changes."
---
Awww, take your upvote, you bright-eyed bastard.
---
That's fair, sometimes I get the itch to use them, than SBQ pops and i use them until they break than back into the closet they go. I like Laser better, Gatling Plasma shoots like i just woke up in the morning to use the bathroom.
---
We could always self-organise.
---
Also there's meant to be a faction PvP thing on the horizon that was mentioned maybe a month ago. Might give us that kick to pick a side and gather.
---
Mushroom Guy? We may needa tha Mario!
---
If Duping continues to compromise the experience, at what point do they end up having to implement BoP on legendaries? I'd hate to see that happen.
---
Low level wepon expotic like the chainsaw :) can’t get ledgendarys or lvl 50 I beleave. I have only seen lvl 20. Is also a 1H bone wepon but I can’t remember what is it 
---
1k dmg a pop
---
This was relevant yesterday. Take your clickbait somewhere else.
---
I absolutely agree with the above comment. Keep the mobs off of us, revive us, and we will repay in kind. It would be super helpful.
---
im surprised the datamined version is not on the x01 tbh
---
Have you checked your in games settings? There are those for audio and chat among other things.
---
I heard mods can get scrapped automatically
---
Seriously.... A little melodramatic don't you think. In the end it's just pixels and t51 isn't really that hard to find
---
Perhaps it means they lose 90 caps (for example), but you only get 45 as the reward, but I am not sure.
---
Never switch weapons. You have become very powerful now
---
I bought the space suit not realizing it was for a woman. That kinda bummed me out alittle
---
I'm upset the BoS daily wasn't daily. I thought it was gonna be a good way to farm BoS gear.
---
This is what ill do with my next new character when new stuff drops.
---
Didnt realise endquest rewards scaled. Probably wont even pick up an overseers holotape until 50
---
You must be like 10 years old
---
Probably a bug inherited from the "picking locks in someones base will now create wanted status" part of this patch.
---
It would be cool if you could find a legendary double called the broomstick, and you could wield it in one hand, while on the other hand you can have the chainsaw. Wishful thinking that's all. 
---
bc you’re armed with your cheat cannon
---
And then a duper comes along, crashes the server. Until the duping is fixed, such features (sadly) won't be very useful. 
---
Contractor perk lowers the material cost to build at CAMP and Workshops so it's very useful to have. Home Defense will let you build better turrets at your CAMP and Worshop. Some will also require Fireproof and Science 1. That's like the kit for building good defenses at Workshops. 
---
If you examine a perk card you can see sometimes the 2nd or higher ranks gives a hidden benefit. Like Armorer for example lowers the cost of making armor at rank 2. Same with Power Smith (Level 41) rank 2 for Power Armor. White Knight (Level 39) will lower the material cost to repair armor to only needing 1 of each material if I remember correctly, which is great because Ballistic Fiber isn't so easy to get. 
---
Just to have a workshop that makes all the alcohol. It's not too game breaking I think. 
---
And that had been fixed already by modders.
---
For me, each time I enter Grafton, it seems like every second event is "IT'S GRAFTON DAY! ^(Again)"
---
K I'll use for really high level PvP
---
The more common bone weapons are the cultist’s blade and cultist’s dagger
---
Nice. 
---
The game mechanics are stupid, it will scrap mods for materials if you don't have enough materials when doing something. It may have a scrapped it for metal or something if you went to repair a weapon
---
Stupid question. Are you talking about the settings you get either at the start screen or by going into the map and pressing L1? Cause if you are then yes I have.
---
Naa not these 
---
Looks epic mate well done. 
---
Considering it's a Furious Explosive Gatling Plasma, I'd say it'll help lol.
---
every bounty I have seen reduces over time, not sure why though 
---
It's like leave a penny, take a penny; you'd find in convenience stores years ago.
---
Great idea!
---
i've literally had this since launch day. That and random frame drops. I was sure it was my video card so i upgraded but it didnt help. PC if that wasnt clear
---
Yeah i had a two-shot shotgun.. not tse and it's accuracy was so terrible i stopped using it.  The range i had to be at to do full damage.. i might as well have been melee.
---
If you bulked or crafted items before using them they can be scrapped. Also is you server hop quickly sometimes the disappear 
---
yea my shotgun is only lvl 35 but i would rather use that than something that is duped
---
Unless you got the bug where you collect them and they never bloom again
---
The skin for the weapon workstation. It looks great, but whenever I load into my game or fast travel back to my base the fucking station is moved 90 degrees. It’s so weird. I stopped using it. 
---
If u do 'scrap all junk' at workbenches it scraps  mods too sometimes
---
Anyone have x01 legs with calibrated shocks on them already.. I'll buy them or trade for them.. 
---
Is the patch out for consoles yet? posting on the 14th of january.
---
Bought mine from Lewisburg station.
---
Havent bought anything yet. Nothing really sticks out yet. Although ive had my eye on that atomic blast lamp and waiting for more PA paint jobs for my X-01
---
"You people made your beds"
---
What? You mean we bought the continuation of a franchise we loved and it's our fault that the ball has been dropped, deflated, and pooped on by a AAA company looking for a land grab. TSE's have nothing to do with the buggy bosses and lack or originality applied to anywhere except the 2 hot spots. 
---
Lv 70 here. I have never met a griefer, 95% players are neutral and ignore you, the rest are friendly. The only PVP I had was when capturing workshops or accidentally getting a bounty when opening locked doors on other ppl bases. I am on PC

Grafton or Watoga?

What a dog crawler be doing in Welch?!  This is the ash heap not the mire you lost ass crustacean 
---
I pick up everything. Dirty water is never at any point as available as purified since I have two purifiers at home, one at the Landfill and a couple others at random workshops. I usually end up selling them because they're good caps and I always have far more than I can drink.
---
Contrast that to dirty water which I'll get maybe 8-10 of a session. That's usually how many purified I start with. You simply shouldn't be forced to use worse water for anything.
---
Damn Beef. Sorry I missed it. I've been MIA for like a week I need to get back into the game.
---
I don’t think it’s a time thing, I think it’s a glitch.  For me the bounty always halves as soon as I get close to the target. 
---
if only...
---
&gt; Awareness perk shows modified armor values.
---
Reflects modifications from perks only.
---
Wish they would it’s ruining the trading aspect of the game
---
I got a three star tse handmade but I can't remember tbe third perk and some caos if you're willing to trade
---
Setting -&gt; Audio -&gt; there you can adjust how the voice is used. Auto, team, area, none.
---
Now there's an idea... outlaw the TSE guns.. each shot fired gives you +100 cap bounty.
---
139, only 1 explosive dragon, 1 two shot minigun 
---
I heard it's from the dev room, it's not meant to be in the game yet.
---
I'm not sure if Scrap All Junk will actually scrap mods (even rarely)... I've had mods in my inventory for ages and always press Triangle on PS4.
---
But I do believe that if the mod contains a junk material and you run low on it when crafting/repairing, it will consume the mod to do it.
---
Yes my eye is also on that lamp. Cool design!
---
No I'm giving an opinion where I am happy to state FO76 is well worth investing time into it, but too many just want to bitch, moan and complain for the sake of it, IF you can't understand this, then please at least try to comprehend the fact that many of us "fans" will continue to play FO76 despite its obvious issues, but then again I get the feeling you won't bother, because you are a small minded child.
---
I had a guy like this in destiny 2 before. After a game where his team lost... he psn messaged me that I was hacking and cheating with lag out tricks. I was like dude, our team lost and I was lowest on the scoreboard what are your talking about. He wouldn't stop, he was relentless that I hacked or duped. I told him maybe you are just bad if the worst person on the opposing team killed you over and over again, without hacking or cheating, and you are getting salty about it. He still wouldn't stop for literally 30 mins after the first message to the point that I had to block him.
---
Grafton Rail Station vendor sells BOS materials for Combat Armor (Arms, Legs, Chest). Not always in inventory (RNG) but that's where most people get them.
---
have you ever seen blooms during heart of the swamp? I tried a number of times with no luck
---
I tried going to the bloom area before going to the event, going to the event and then going back to where the blooms spawn, completing the event until the queen spawns and then checking, and going directly after the event as well as all other kinds of variations I could think of
---
after about a dozen heart of the swamp events I gave up, and then randomly stumbled across blooms one day when the even wasn't even active
---
As far as I can tell, all of the trapper materials should be scrap unlocks, so you spam out arms with Armorsmith 2+ and Super Duper and eventually you should unlock them.
---
Might take hundreds though.
---
As someone else said, check vendors. I got a TS from one at the weekend.
---
how is this spam when boogie just released the video 10 minutes ago?
---
In 300 plus I've seen 2 both of which had nothing to do with my build so I sold them. My buddy gets them every 10 levels or so. Go figure
---
Yes I've tried all of them, except "none" of course lol.
---
That must have been an epic moment like in a movie where some machinery keeps working by sheer force of willpower 
---
Sounds like something you could fix with a mo- oh wait 😳
---
In hind-site this is absolutely the route. But after dropping bags for menial things like ammo and mats, it became such a norm in my group.  Now that we have lost high value items like flux using the drop system, we pretty much exclusively trade goods.
---
Besides, no one was expecting some blueberry to come out of nowhere and commit grand theft power armor. I guess I assumed the camp was secluded enough that it wasn't a big deal. We had literally done this two days before to paint the majority of the armor.
---
Its definitely a "fool me once" kinda thing.
---
I've never duped but I heard the Enclave is not opposed to duping. Modus will do it for a fee.
---
I've never counted the Clipboards, but I have counted total scrap from there
---
39 Springs, 14 Screws, 18 Ballistic Fiber, 12 Plastic, Lots of Steel, and a few of several other things.
---
I had my CAMP next to there for over a Month, and had the run down to about 6 minutes.
---
Well that's unfortunate. Herd mentality perk requires I be in a team. When my brother isn't able to play I invite random players for the bonus.
---
Only time I've lately accepted a team invite is if the person is in front of me.
---
I didn't accept otherwise because I thought the free fast travelling was scummy but what you said makes total sense.
---
Makes me question if I should even accept in person invites too.
---
I don't think it has that , it doea medium swing 
---
I agree.  If someone calls me a name once, who cares.  If its repeated, that's harassment and a different story.
---
I was trying to decide whether to buy this mod at the Enclave Bunker, and your video persuaded me. Thanks! Useful &amp; concise.
---
This. I traded my pieces to a guy for him to BoS paint on it. Worked like a charm.
---
No worries at all! I only mean to help, yeah it's a bummer really but I guess there has to be a trade off. In regards to that yeah I was made aware that marathoner doesn't work I've just forgot to change it on the build there, I believe I went for an extra point in adrenaline and then switched a point out to endurance or luck I think. (Think I might've gone with the 3rd star bloody mess) 
---
 Born survivor is preference if you want it there but I play on Xbox and in case you didn't know right on the d pad is a one click auto stim (incase you didn't know and want the extra point). 
---
Yeah I originally looked at refractor but once you've got the xo1 PA you have the best energy resistance going so having the 60% glowing damage boost is fantastic when doing whitesprings nuke. 
---
As for the charisma, yeah if you're mainly a solo player like me lone wanderer is imo a no brainer. 20% less dmg and 30% AP regen for what? Just being on your own..
---
Yeah my build is a very specific one so a few of the perks won't translate as well unless you go down the bloodied route, but glad I could be of some assistance. 
---
Sorry already been sold 
---
Because it is a video of the same thing that has been reported and posted multiple times but with a stupid "this game is dying" comment added to it.
---
Promoting this garbage is spamming.
---
Yea id actually get that in real life. Wish there were more paint jobs for weapons too. 
---
It's almost as if what the community wanted all along was co-op + fallout, not fallout - single-player
---
American flag?  Was there a cleaner version available at some point besides the ratty damaged one you can find on vendors?
---
There have been reports of some people being banned. There hasn't been a clear criteria on who, how, or why. It appeared to be mostly targeted at people who make videos showing exploits.
---
I ran into a lvl 59 griefing low lvls near Flatwoods, this dude had a 50 cap bounty so I figured I'd collect. Right when I show up he's smashing up some little base near the river behind the church so I take a shot at him forgetting I had pacifist mode on and he ports away.
---
 I caught up with him on top of the big bridge to the south, he hid behind the fire truck thinking I didnt see his big yellow ass (excavator armor), im a mutie so I just jumped over it and shot him in the back. 
---
Guy gets suuuuper salty, messaging me saying Im picking on him and he's blocking me blah blah blah. I kind of just giggle to myself and shrug it off. Later I get a notification that so and so is wanted again, but as Ive been blocked I can't see him on the map. I decide to just look for any group of low levels and port near them to keep an eye out. Sure enough,  dude runs by my hunting blind within 2 mins and I killed him again. 
---
This guy loses it, calls me a hacker (among other things) and says he will report me, I was laughing  so hard I had to quit the server. I think him freaking out was the by far the best part of the total exchange.
---
I hope my power armor will hold out for that long. That decreased repair cost will save me some springs!
---
well then they would have to rewrite the code because if one of you are logged out half the camp would be missing and could create other problems probably lag out the server.
---
Do consoles have push to talk? I doubt it, but thought I'd ask.
---
No theres a legendary effect
---
Thank you. 🙏
---
So would I, totally my man's. It's badass
---
Right? 
---
They can see whether you entered the room or not, so you're ok. But you should definitely report people who you bought from. They'll be selling this stuff for caps or even worse real money, and all the items will be deleted from inventorys soon. They are literally selling stolen items
---
Yeah there are some really good perks under Endurance, but I think most people this it is all useless survival perks.
---
When I'm low on cans of dog food I switch out Good Boy for Cannibal, so that way I can eat most things I kill and because of Sunkissed any Rads gained from eating corpses is quickly healed away. Essentially.. Cannibal + Sunkissed = unlimited 'safe' to eat food. Same with Aqua Boy + Sunkissed, you you can jump right into a lake and start drinking til your full because by the time you've gotten out of the water Sunkissed will have already removed most if not all the Rads you just gained from drinking lake water
---
Right? I wish I new which ones were rare so I could held on to them, cause I'm sure there's one's I dropped or sold :(
---
Will I learn torso mods from arms though?
---
More upvotes for this guy. I bought him from -1 to 0!
---
Here's what I've gotten:
---
Clean Small Water Purifier - I have two at my CAMP, keeps me well stocked on water and I prefer the cleaner look. I like to think my guy does proper maintenance!
---
Patriotic Armor Paint - I liked the design for the power armors.
---
Nuka Cola Stash Box - Just love the stuff, collect it all for my CAMP.
---
Red Rocket Garage Door - Don't even use it currently, hate the cheap metal edges but wanted it while it was available.
---
Tricentenial Paints - From my preorder.
---
Welcome Home neon sign - Have it on the front of my CAMP facing a road welcoming anyone in who wants to use the benches, bed, piano or purifiers.  I keep everything unlocked to encourage no one attacking the CAMP.
---
And all this from ATOMS earned in game, no cash yet though there are a few I have considered.
---
People were posting a few days ago about how you shouldn't do that b/c it causes the queen to bug and she will fly out of bounds. Have you noticed this at all when you nuke?
---
The mods being scrapped needs to be fixed next patch.  That and plan tracking, I could get only those two things in a patch and be thrilled
---
he's explaining the situation to his subscribers that may not have known what is going on yet. I think it's important to here his take on it. but downvote me, whatever I know how this subreddit is.
---
They might have just centered on the wrong fissure.
---
It's "powered gates". Not doors
---
&gt; Just to clarify, I'm not going to hunt some low level player with a 10  cap bounty, I assume that most likely they did something and weren't  aware of the consequences so I dont bother. I only go after those with a  bounty of 30 or more because that means they messed up multiple times  and had time to see the wanted warning on their HUD 
---
The result of not going for the lower levels can be an actual griefer goes for them and they have a worse experience than you going for them, as you seem to care. I engage with all levels if theyre wanted and give help after the kill. Even lvl 100+ players are sometimes clueless about many mechanics in the game and need some help.
---
OMG this is me and my husband! Except he is the careful meticulous one and I'm running around like a kid on a sugar high!
---
Maybe the people talking all have their mic setup to Party Chat / Team only.  So you see they are talking but they have it set to not broadcast?
---
When ever I'm online on PS4 using my mic I have a Party setup with my friendslist.  And it says "Party Chat Prioritized" so I'm pretty sure all our mic traffic is only for us to hear.
---
Anyone who takes any of that is just as guilty as the duper, including you.
---
You're not wrong, and I perhaps I overreacted. But as someone who has a finite amount of time to invest in this game, and the fact that it happened in my friends camp with all of us around, yeah I took it personal.
---
Why do you assume duping is the cause of server instability?
---
I've had severe server lag just from using tinker benches.
---
The problem is the game was never properly tested.
---
You haven't seen his other posts on here including removed ones. Also, the thing about three months is that he saying he got it from a friend that played 3 months, left, and came back. It's an inconsistency in the story and timeline. A lot of this guy's replies have that and it's a Hallmark of lying. If you scroll down you can see where someone linked to his post about this same item yesterday.
---
I prefer the gatling gun. It doesnt shoots too fast  so it feels like you arent wasting too much ammo. Crafting 5mm rounds isnt that difficult and I  dont like wasting fc's for a weapon, i keep my fc's for power armor.  I am a big gunner but not with Energy weapons. I use the. 50 cal aswell but my main weapon is a two shot gatling gun
---
This happened to me about 4:20amEST  Sunday. Server not responding, then ok. Server not responding, then ok. Server not responding, then ok. Then, disconnected from server. So frustrating!
---
Yeah 100% pc is a different animal... I find ammo and plans  At almost every vendor, which I appropriately switch for stuff I need for stuff I already have…feels better helping people out then taking there junk imo
---
Also unlocked it from scrapping bats
---
his take on it is trying to sensationalize and spread false information in order to get clicks that's what his take on it is I guarantee you there's zero new information.
---
Is subscribers will get a notification he posted a new video there's no reason to drop that garbage here.
---
Made the fight that much easier for sure! Kept think to myself "it's going to brake any minute now!"
---
Yea! I'm really tired of seeing great weapons for 500 caps
---
On final stage in 1 Mon so ready to launch nuke in 6/7 mins if anyone else is wanting in
---
Unlucky!
---
I was wondering why I couldnt access poseidon without crashing 
---
But how could that be on ps4? 
---
That happens about a fifth of the time for me no matter where I put the nuke. 
---
Does a Google Doc bounty list exist for all platforms? Wanna help the cause tonight.
---
Just a couple extra 0s
---
Guess we need to post a video of every single youtuber covering the same topic in it's own thread because of their viewers. It's been covered and talked about here, hence its spam. 
---
what exactly is false here? i'm not trying to argue with you but I dont see any false information in his video. The game was released in a very buggy state, he recaps on all the issues that happened and now we find out another issue with bethseda. What is so wrong with a recap leading up to current events that is somehow false?
---
That's interesting, so you mean there was only 1 nuke dropped in Appalachia and that's where it went? 
---
1 sighting and kill and i'm at level 113
---
How do I get it to here after it’s recorded?
---
People usually nuke morgantown for the flux If I remember right. Violet.
---
Yes... having an icon next to a plan in a shop that indicates whether or not you know that already would be great.
---
Maybe no one wants to talk to you then.
---
Energy weapons have the same durability curve regardless of the RoF of the gun. Ballistic weapons, on the other hand, have single shot, high rof, 6 gun, etc. curves. So every shot of your gatling laser is the same loss of durability as a single shot of your laser pistol. Hence why your gun breaks so darn fast.
---
Yeah true. I wouldn't invest in those perks as a min/maxer, but it wouldn't be out of place in a fun survivalist build. 
---
Yeah, I found one BoS torso plan from a treasure map but the chances are likely to be crazy low. Grafton rail has maybe one BoS plan per 10 visits. Player trading is common because people naturally end up with spares.
---
I got booted like 3-4 times within an hour on Sat.  Seems worse than before the patch.
---
Then yesterday I was literally the only person shown on the map, TWICE!  I had a lame wanted level from picklocking someone's a camp and was trying to get killed and couldn't!
---
Yeah I know. But you could be using that plastic for things other than exploiting a glitch that gave you extra acid. Like bilking the other scrap items overflowing from your stash. 
---
You have to learn this one by scrap loop, I believe. I've never seen it for sale.
---
Build the cheapest thing you can (it's either an arm or a leg for trapping depending on what material you have the most of), scrap it, repeat. Goes faster with Super Duper. Have fun with that - it's a pain.
---
No point in hoarding good shit when the duper’s already have a million of all the high end items
---
Send the report regardless. Can never be to sure. 
---
Doxing people? Wow
---
Great idea, with my melee build im not so good vs the scortchbeast until it lands but those mobs are fun!
---
oh man i think if i got that id make a bunch of gear and scrap it to learn all the mods i can!
---
Fantastic!! All stuff I didn't know before thank you so much! 
---
I'm enjoying listening to many a true nerd and Oxhorn at the moment . 
---
I've got a 1 star handmade with 50% armor penetration which is all I need. I play by myself 99% of the time and only defend myself from players if needed. 
---
I'd suggest there's more at play here. Specifically two things: protest at the 'online' direction and taking the chance to slam Bethesda for largely unrelated practices.    
---
In the case of the former, obviously Bethesda games were some of the last big, singleplayer multiplatform games. Some people feel betrayed that Bethesda would toy with an online only "Games as a Service". For those people 76 was never going to be enough, because it's mare existence was seen as an insult. 
---
In the case of the later, the game is being used as a chance to 'make an example' of Bethesda. Bethesda games are widely loved, but it's easy to see examples of Bethesda refusing to address long-standing bugs, becoming complacent and/or countless examples of poor QA. Reviewers might note that in reviews of FO3/4/Skyrim, but in general it's given a pass because it's a solid core game and trashing Skyrim would lead to too much backlash (no matter how often it's been ported).       
---
But back with FONV we saw the tide beginning to turn when NV was marked down for the same bugs that were ignored in FO3.     
---
FO76 isn't widely loved, and I think some people see that as a chance to attack Bethesda for all those past slights. 
---
It's unfortunate, because 76 is 'fine'. Not great, not awful... just fine (and with a lot of potential). But Fo76 is really not given a fair shake.      
---
A great example of that is the outcry over duping/dev-room cheats. Did the Diablo die because of cheating? Did duping bugs kill World of Warcraft? Just about every online game has struggled with issues like those, but in the case of F076 there's articles and vlogs everywhere decrying the 'doom' of the game. Balls. It's unfortunate, but it's not going to hurt the game nearly as much as the constant gleeful hit-pieces some reviewers enjoy churning out.
---
People can make videos for whatever they want. Posting it in this sub when it has nothing new to add is spam.
---
Conversation over.
---
I like pvp but completely avoid it now.  There’s no upside particularly when opponents can one-shot with duped OP guns and bobble heads.  I haven’t turned off pacifist in a long time.
---
If they made bobble heads not stack, made explosive guns not get additional double damage from the explosives perk, maybe destroy all the nerfed guns?, and create incentives to participate in PvP, then I would definitely do it
---
I hear it's because she aggroed on a player that DC'd.
---
What is this about a murder church and oven?? Got a link to the videos?
---
Joined in on my first sbq fight last night got in my tags on the queen and walked around with an anti armour shotgun and nocturnal explosive handmade which honestly didn’t puppy a visible dent in her but takes scorched heads off cleanly
---
False, he's Gary's husband.
---
Their love child will be the end game boss.
---
that's your opinion not fact, and I had every right to post it, but if you dont want to discuss it further that is fine.
---
will do. working on getting my x-01 built and then i will happily play garbage man!
---
Definitely the only way to go when providing or using power armor crafting services. 
---
Mods and certain items that are used in crafting (Beer Bottles, Baseballs, Hallucinogen Canisters, etc) have never been scrapped when I do "Scrap All Junk".  But they can be consumed when repairing, modding, or crafting.
---
I had a lot of "server not responding" on Saturday.  Checked the map, two sets of three players.  Both sets had one 100+ and two &lt; 5's.  Both in the middle of no where.  I server hopped and got the same but not as bad.  Check the map again, exact same thing.  One 130 with a level 2 and a level 5.  Server hop again, was stable for the next three hours.
---
Not saying it was duping but it seemed very odd and matches what the guy posted.  Game was almost unplayable on that first server and just slow on that second.  Third was just fine.
---
I'm not so hard on them. Maybe with PC you could do hotfixes but the whole point of the PC patch first, later with console is for the very reason that consoles are harder to do little fixes for like you're suggesting.
---
So we either have PC WAY ahead of the curve in terms of patches or we have what we have now, which isn't terrible. Ain't great but could be worse too.
---
Also, you're assuming they knew how to fix it as soon as the exploits were found. Don't have a lot of faith that BGS have that kind of skills and experience on their team based on some of the solutions I've seen them release.
---
BOS ( brotherhood of steel,  right? ) 
---
It’s also a stupid point. The game made a sacrifice of realism to provide a better challenge, which I fully support. I like realism but challenge is more important to me. If ammo was more plentiful, the game would be too easy for me.
---
Good point. Other games never have bugs and crashes, particularly just after they came out.
---
You must be a, duper...  BURN HIM!!! 
---
Also, both Sunkissed and Photosynthetic are GREAT perks to share when on a team since they don't require you to be in range of teammates for them to get the buff. Meaning you can be constantly passively healing (HP or Rads depending on which you share) anyone on your team regardless of where they are. I do this often for my friends so they don't have to worry about using Radaways or Stimpaks while traveling since I just watch there health bars and just share whichever is needed at the time.
---
I’snt it just a reference to this? [](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatwoods_monster)
---
Yeah I expect it doesn't work when I'm on playstation party but I do wander around the wasteland by myself alot when none of my friends want to play and I still haven't been able to talk/hear anyone. I didn't mention in my original post but I did hear a lady the other day. I was trying to talk but she kept saying "hello...hello" and apparently couldn't hear me. This time and one other time when I was actually able converse with a person was the only time I could talk/hear someone.

You have to save it to a usb and transfer it to your computer.
---
Something I did in BETA and probably still works is to nuke an area with one or more workshops, and then claim them.  The defend waves with nuked creatures was craaaaaaazy though I don’t think it spawns any/many legendaries :/
---
Yes which is why my .50 and MG42 are much more efficient. 
---
That sucks, sorry it's not working right. I just share the one star rad sponge and it works great. With the whole party in PA it seems to be all any of us ever need.
---
Yeah the problem is that the player who sold me the item is for sure an alt character level 2. I never bought and wouldn't buy a virtual item for real money. At least he sold me for caps just 1000. Btw thanks! Btw this is a good idea. I'm going to report him
---
Nothing new
---
There have been reports of people being banned where there is video evidence on YouTube, but who knows if they are true or not
---
Maybe
---
Ahh okay thanks 
---
I think that's a fair view... on the other hand, in some ways it has more roleplaying than the Bethesda games that came before it. It comes down to how you play and who you play with.
---
Your opinion is also opinion and not fact, and I had every right to report it as spam. Funny how that works both ways.
---
Hopefully others will also start reporting when these types of garbage posts are made and we can have a bit cleaner sub.
---
Plenty enough room stop holding onto to weapons you can’t or don’t use and sell them. 
---
i noticed that the other day too. nbd to me, i'm kind of meh about everything in the atomic shop anyways
---
Edgy.
---
Drop them off in the nearest Train Depot or Overseer's Cache.
---
The weightless legendary applies to the base armor weight before the mods weight are added.
---
I prefer my TSE MG42 and .50 for the durability and sheer damage output.
---
I had a very similar problem. I was playing alone and three dudes 100+ started griefing my camp that I had just finished rebuilding after mine was zooted in a glitch. They started lobbing explosives and bothering me and I tried to ignore them, thinking they would give up if I didn’t respond, outgunned one of them just out of luck, and then they started PMing me on Xbox Live so I spammed them with Jeb Bush Facts(TM) until they presumably blocked me first and went silent. 
---
It’s just exceptionally frustrating bc once they start, I can’t really do anything except leave the map or keep dying and I’m still fairly low level because I haven’t played a lot since I lost my first camp. The frequency of these encounters with people griefing seems like it’s gotten to be so high I can’t really enjoy my camp or building in it. 
---
&gt;Find them in Deathclaw Island, the Enclave Base Cave, the cave that looks like a face in the Savage Divide, and a substation in the Cranberry Marsh.  
---
May I just ask wtf did I just read 
---
Same Enclave vendor you buy the serums from, though be it they're rare. Scorched beast Queen has a chance to drop them as well.
---
Get a dense chest mod and Fireproof, enjoy explosion immunity (SB sonic attack is apparently classified as explosive damage)
---
Yeah me and my fiancé play together quite often! It makes it just that little bit more fun!
---
I got the limbs and the chest piece from a vendor at Harper's Fairy

If you use the mic at all, a speaker will pop up above your head. But when players crouch, it typically hides there names.

Yes girlfriends are the best wasteland companions. Mine refuses to take any advice and wants to learn everything on her own, so adorable.

---
Very true. If I see low lvls with a bounty, I usually kill them to clear it, but then let them get their junk back and might even toss them a decent low lvl weapon
---
Whiskey for everyone!
---
&gt; I can’t imagine having such a worthless life that I cheated in a video game to such an extreme extent. I can’t imagine being so low IQ and low sportsmanship to rationalize it. 
---
Money. I dont see how some people haven't realized this yet. The crazy dupers (200k+ stuff like this guy) do it so they can sell TSE weapons for a few bucks each. Over time this can get very lucrative. 
---
That doesn't mean its not a shitty move, it is. But to say that it cant be rationalized is just naive.
---
I don't have a TSE weapon, i don't hang out with dupers 😂😂
---
I'd report regardless. Like you probably spent about as much time posting this than you would reporting the dupers.

No worries. 😀

I'm not promoting a sub, I am simply a subscriber who likes less spam in my sub :)

Good luck trying to get clicks on your clickbait video or karma or whatever it is you are after with this spam.
---
I'll take your word for it. I have used a minigun with the shredder mod quite a bit, and while it does crazy damage in melee, those guns still break rather fast. A supersledge on the other hand never breaks.
---
Guess so. As long as it's not serious doxxing, like just go and kill this guy and take his shit. Not swat him. I would love if the game had in game bounty boards, like we add a name to the list and it takes x amount of caps away and if the bounty is claimed withing a certain amount of times the caps are sent to their character. If not just back in the bank. 
---
They’d have to rebuff whitesprings or add more variety to nuke sites, as it’d be way more effort for the same reward.
---
I also showed all of my friends, I can barely manage to make a decent looking camp, never mind a murder church or player oven. I almost wish you never made a video though because now all these people know about it!
---
I don't dupe, that ruins the game
---
Not a chance!
---
It appeared in your inventory as a consumable plan, yeah? I've checked and nothing.
---
If it appears unlocked in my weapons bench later (I honestly haven't checked) I'm going to... probably cry. I don't know.
---
Ah not a melee player so i wouldnt know, it doesn't have it , sorry. 
---
Level 94 on my main and I've only gotten two drops that are even two shot.  No TSE either.
---
I also keep mine open. It’s ok by me if they want to use my stuff
---
I remember my 10th birthday too!
---
Pay this man Bethesda. This shit us niiiiceee
---
They are not called griefers because they want a fair fight...
---
Why locking a base if you just can shoot out a wall piece
---
i...dont care about clicks? lmao you think I was going to get massively upvoted on this sub that is known for its star citizen like cult following? this is why the fallout sub laughs at this place. Secondly i'm not boogie dude I dont care if you wish to not view the video. You make far too many assumptions of motive.
---
Give it a few months
---
I think you need to look at some posts as auction posts. Although not clearly listed often times the seller is looking for multiple offers before accepting  highest bid!  
---
Yeah I was just responding that it's not that way for ARK. I didn't say anything about FO76.
---
Ultracite and prime are equal in terms of damage.  Ultracite is a type of weapon, and prime is a type of mod.  Thus, you can have a TSE with a Prime reliever or an Ultracite TSE and the would have the same multiplier to damage for scorched.  Finally, you could have an Ultracite TSE with a Prime reliever and the damage multiplier from both would apply, making it the best damage vs. scorched possible.
---
Well written, I am aware of the issues you stated here but I figured my post would look too long had I added it all. It seems with our powers combined, we have accomplished that anyway lol.
---
PC or console? I think a lot of the PC bans coincided with the latest patch. The consoles haven't had that patch yet.
---
i was in  the late 50's to mid 60's during it's construction. now 73
---
Yeah, I do that one, too, but it's not all that frequent.
---
Do you do it with the Recon scope? Someone mentioned they thought you get better loot if you use the recon scope and so far I've gotten T60 plans and some pretty decent stuff using the recon scope and not just killing the scorched.
---
If you think that had any effect on there day to day duping and junk collecting you are sadly mistaken. You shoulda waited maybe you coulda got a bag of some actual good stuff
---
122 and have only done Enclave completely and Overseer chain.  I’ve done a few side things and like half of Rose’s.
---
Agree completely 
---
Why? So you can't be *that* parent that doesn't give a flying shit about their kid and what sort of content they're being exposed to/exposing themselves to?? No 8yo should be playing a Fallout game. They can't buy it on their own either, so the only way there's 8yos playing is because their stupid parents don't give a shit about what their kid is doing online.
---
Well, if someone can write a mod for it that quickly when not being paid to do it then they should be able to incorporate into the game just as quickly.
---
Yeah ik if u pick a lock or blow out a wall piece you become wanted either way 
---
Keep it just in case. You should be able to get out of the ban if they give you one. If they have logs of items picked up and they ban you you can appeal the ban with the video, they can check and see it was the same item, and if you caught the duper they will be caught if they haven't already. But I can't make any guarantees, but either way, keep the video.
---
Haha hopefully they just steal your concept
---
"Sometimes" the weightless breaks, and will only properly calculate if you change the mods. I had a bloodied missile launcher that kept reverting to about 20 pounds and I finally gave up 
---
7% more damage from Tenderizer, -30% damage output from Suppresor, but with the Syringer, that DR reduction may add up significantly 
---
I was actually starting to think I was overreacting but I guess I'm not the only one feeling this way.
---
I chuckled, nice one dad.
---
Probably the worst experience I've had in the game (including the uncountable blue screens), but its funny now that I look back :) Haha sirnick and Cadd went full Mr. Hyde on the dude. After a while I was ready to drop it and get on with the Queen slay but they were out for blood.
---
Check out the trading subs- you can sell that stuff for caps.
---
Scrap prices are all over the place- avg. on ammo is around 2 rounds per cap- can vary a lot also.
---
I managed to pull a ton - like 5x-9x each time, if they had any at all - of frag grenades off of super mutants in the penitentiary the other day. Definitely made it into my inventory, I had 45 by the time I was done.
---
Quests became mandatory. If you didnt do it it would crash your game
---
Also you can get the plans for water purifiers at the Overseers Cache at Camp McKlintock and Charleston. And the Fusion Generator, Windmill, and Large Generator plans from Power Up Poseidon event, if you do it a few times you'll get them all.

Do what is fun to you. There are many places on the big map worth exploring. You'll level up and find good loot while you're at it. At some point it becomes really easy to win from any NPC and your perk build starts not to matter so much anymore. You could then focus your build on 'quality of life' perks or try to specialize in a certain direction to take on the final challenge, fighting other players. You could specialize in big guns, semi and automatic rifles or pistols, melee, etc. To optimize your build it's also recommended you take desired mutations and legendary effects into account, which can also all be googled. Actually I have some threads open that I use a lot which you might find useful:

Have you ever heard of Sirlin? Probably a decent read if you're really curious on something like this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sirlin
---
once you place the CAMP and the device open it has locked in your area. now that CAMP device can be moved like any other peice of furniture, it just cannot be stored.  Moving the device this way changes nothing within you camp, you are just limited to moving it within the green build zone.
---
If you move outside the green zone and hit the moved CAMP button then it packs up the whole camp. Hope that helps.
---
I actually had them make it into my inventory the other day. From 0 to 45 frag grenades in nothing flat.
---
No, theft deserves appropriate response.  It's not like the guy didn't know what he was doing running up and stealing the PA.  He had it coming, he got what he deserved.
---
Don't worry i was just joking 
---
Well that's because of its ROF. 
---
I'll have to try it out.
---
Locking bases keeps out wildlife, but also stops players from trolling you or continually harassing. I was very open with my camps in the beginning, even being very close to the overseers camp on purpose to help new players. That's until I started to get trolled by low levels and harassed by high levels. I started locking my camp structure and left only the water purifiers open. Times changed more and I had tamed a deathclaw. I had to move because players are murderous rather than respectful. Living in the mountains alone is peaceful, until someone finds you and griefs. You can't stop that "feature".
---
I'd say that more than 8 million lbs (the 4 I took plus the 4 that's left) is pretty good. Their mule is dead, and they lost that stuff. That's the only thing that matters to me.
---
You sound like you could be my next target!
---
Yeah I think Watoga Station falls under "Unique" it shares the daily caps with Grahm the traveling super mutant merchant
---
lmao after seeing the final design of theirs I wouldn't be against it.
---
Yeah, I've seen two so far
---
The queen is done, when a handful of people show up. It's when the whole server shows up--and half of them are just standing around--that you can't kill her, because she scales on number of people. Also, her health going back to 100% isn't a glitch, all legendaries regen to fill health the first time they drop below 50%.

---
Well of course. I'm just saying the damage done to durability loss is in no way equal across many of the weapon types.
---
Thank you! 
---
this deserves all the upvotes, lol
---
I roleplay as other things but I can ally with you guys since the responders made allies with almost every other faction
---
Everyone has extremely powerful god tier weapons that are very very rare because of duping, those people have duped 400-500 explosive bobbleheads, stacked them, and join a new server when it's about to run out to refresh it. Because of that they one shot you while in passive mode like it's nothing and kill players just because.
---
Duping has gotten so bad servers are crashing after 10-20 minutes (consoles this is still a problem). In short. The exploits have ruined the game completely. 
---
everything
---
What I'm trying to say is that player stashes are currently limited as they are precisely to avoid there being 24 separate instances of huge stashes.
---
So right now it's not a problem.
---
If everyone had thousands of pounds of stuff, it'd be a lot more of a problem.
---
Understand?
---
All good
---
Another weird thing like mama dolces. I liked. Calling them I. Because I knew others, particularly low levels could benefit. If it's just me I probably won't bother anymore.
---
I will check it out, but I honestly dont see an argument made from anyone but exploiters themselves that exploiting is a good thing.
---
For a youtuber who has a large following to use FO76 banning exploiters (which is one of the biggest things the community has asked for, due to it wrecking a lot of aspects of the game) as a bad thing was a bit shocking to me. 
---
Usually happens when there are other non-stealth players or mobs engaging your target. It's not really a problem, but you can expect to do much less damage coop than solo.
---
Eh, she pretty much killed everyone except a couple girls the Raiders manged to off.  But worse then simple betrayal I'd think.
---
Sorry. That's what I meant - move the camp so everything is stored and has to be re-dropped. Others have said that's a good way to fix it when a griefer strikes.
---
That was my first thought. It makes my Starlet Sniper weep in overencumbered.
---
He’s used to have 20k too. Look through this post. Someone commented the old photo he deleted. Super fishy 
---
So it's pretty common practice to silently discover an exploit, present that exploit to the developer so they can fix it, then publish the exploit after a sufficient amount of time has passed.
---
It serves a few purposes.  You can motivate the developer to fix the issue.  Also you can give a heads up to people so they can avoid running the exploitable software.  By implementing a workaround or running the patch the developer has released to address the issue.
---
Having said that, all youtubers are doing is trying to make money.
---
Tip number one pretty much just says dont PvP... because everyone has explosive weapons at this point.
---
Also you may have seen this but it's good for planning your build.
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Exactly, wife and kids get more attention than console or PC
---
I remember when they had the "trading exploit." I tried trading with someone and they yelled at me and accused me of trying to steal their really good weapon and that I was going to get reported. I'm just thinking OK then.
---
Yep! Name is jakr4bbit
---
ended up finding a players base who locked their front door but they were on the edge of a pond with those water purifiers and had thier base kinda horseshoed around them but no wall blocking me from just getting in from there
---
unless they make specific containers actually lootable by strangers the locked door mechanic is pretty useless at this point(unless you make some kinda trap with it)
---
How much of that aid do you actually use? I mean, probably a quarter of my guy's current weight is aid items and I probably only use 4-5 of them. I know I should sell a lot of that miscellaneous stuff off.
---
Beth either lying or being incompetent both seem like valid options lmao.
---
I think the problem was that Beth thought the game would require lower administration than it actually does and have not put a proper team in place to deal with things. Many other games have weekly updates/fixes but b/c they have to deal with console they spread them out on PC as well instead of making a console-specific comprehensive update. 
---
With the way they botched the launch and the underwhelming offerings/performance of the atomic shop, we probably won't see it proper attention to it anytime soon. 
---
Ita the weird face cave near a fissure! I got pinned down by a scorch beast, and ran in for cover only to be torn to bits by a 3 star legendary alpha deathclaw.
---
I was level 18!

---
Where do you people get all these hordes of low level leechers people? Whenever i launch a nuke i get 1-2 guys there tops. Not that i'm complaining really. It's just funny how different the expirience can be.
---
No no, just that the Overseer says we really shouldn't use the nukes, but doesn't see another way to deal with the Scorched, so admits it may be necessary to deal with them, by targetting the queen.
---
The Enclave is sketchy as fuck and likes dropping bombs on people.
---
To be clear, I ordered those drops myself, no other players around. When I got the warning, it said something like "You stealing has been observed, and owner has been notified of the deed" and a Protectron attacked me out of nowhere. I did not get wanted.
---
What's Dense?
---
but it's still random. I have 8 industrials and under the premise you proposed i should be able to circle back to my base every 40 minutes to get 40 waters. Even after an hour of adventuring i come back and will have a random number of waters to collect between 15-40
---
For sure gotta do the "test ammo" when dropping bags.  But for stuff like large quantities of ultracite cores or orbital strikes, we'll just do the trade system two-step.
---
Nuke zones are worse then ever. Hopefully they used this time to fix them.  
---
1) A bunch of people shooting automatic weapons all at once. Blue screen.  
---
2) People duping again, server crashes.
---
3) Cars exploding around you, blue screen.  
---
4) Glowing ones running out of a house all at once to attack you, blue screen.  
---
5) Scrapping at a bench, blue screen on inventory load.
---
6) Couldn't find anyone to group up with? Blue screen just to mess with you, now you can't get back into the server where you launched your nuke.
---
7) Eat A squirrel on a stick too fast, blue screen.
---
8) Accidentally get out of your power armor, multiple copies of it are created peppered around the map, blue screen.
---
9) Equip stranger in numbers and everyone that's mutated starts flying through the air, blue screen.
---
10) Just blue screened? Trying to race back into the game to meet back up with your friends? Blue screen as you log in.
---
11) Game detects you are a legit player farming loot? Blue screen.
---
12) Game detects you haven't blue screened in at least 30 minutes? Blue screen.  
---
BS76: Blue Screen 76
---
I'd be happy if they just let us sell the duplicates back to the trader, even if at a small loss.
---
The problem is you are asking for the weapon to be nerfed and it's just no good - it's cyclical and we will always be right back in the same spot complaining and calling for "nerf this weapon it does too much damage!". I'm asking you to think harder for a solution. 
---
(?) Is the problem that this weapon does too much damage?
---
(?) Is it not that other weapons and play styles can't put out this kind of DPS?
---
(?) Is it not that PvP gameplay is too short and annoying when such in-balances exist? 
---
I'm telling you a fact mate - Bethesda's Fallout team had no prior experience and did not put in enough time to craft a properly balanced PvP system. It's fine that you see legendary effects relating to PvP. It's fine that a PvP feature exists. What I'm saying again is they did not have the time to implement a robust PvP system. It's not expected to be balanced right now. You shouldn't expect that it's even good. The state of PvP right now is what they were able to do with limited expertise and time constraints. It'll improve.
---
But not by "nerfing (x) weapon" every time someone determines the DPS is too high. Properly balancing a game requires you to look at different play styles and offer solutions and strategies for how these play styles can be effectively played, and fun, and challenging, for everyone playing PvP (or PvE). 
---
Your solution is something I'd expect from a child who is in elementary school and cannot critically think. I gave you a chance to think about what you are asking for and you blew it. Now you get asshole Mark.
---
There isn't a new method. Some random person posted some anecdotal tall tale and provided not a single shred of actual proof or evidence. The rest of the subs been going hard as fuck on it and everyone casting doubt has been downvotes and insulted. I had 3 people PM me alone saying they will share links with me as proof then proceeded to insult me and all sorts of bazar shit instead. Out of probably a dozen folks that claimed to have proof the only response I've gotten as evidence has literally only been "because I saw it too". Which confuses me because 99% of any duping method I've seen takes place in inventory screens and I don't think people are prone to shouting what actions they are doing over the mic as they do it especially since folks duping are in party chat or team chat. In short it's a bunch of FUD
---
I’m a Senior Knight in a BOS discord, feel free to message me, I may have some spare supplies (my PSN is my reddit name)
---
More than bugs that are wrong with the game.
---
Seeing how this gets brought up daily, I'd be shocked if it's not sometime in the future.  Hopefully not too far away.
---
But yeah...the current strategy on plan organization ("Just keep track of em yourself!") isn't too great.
---
But that is how it was intended.....I think you could ‘trade’ nuke codes to players in the map if they were looking for them.
---
That a YouTuber trying to make money by making controversial videos would make a controversial video is shocking to you? That's how they get large followings, sensationalism and controversy.
---
Ignoring them is the best way to deal with it.
---
I think if you dig deep enough into the combat challenges there's one for killing stuff with it.
---
Hate that damn thing. I turn it off after the quest starts so I don't get it burned into my brain. 
---
&gt; Reflects modifications from perks only.
---
Unless it's changed over the past month, it also shows the armor reduction from Legendary effects, which is how you can confirm the 87.5% figure.
---
I went to the radio tower, ordered a drop, went to the drop area, waited for the drone to drop the quest-marked crate and saw it locked.
---
I think thats a fair way to look at it, but I think there is a difference in publishing the exploit exists vs publishing how to do the exploit. High profile people or a lot of smaller people writing/making videos about it can raise awareness without teaching others how to do it. This prevents the issue from damaging the game even more while still raising awareness, imo.
---
I've found the MG42's durability to be excellent.
---
Glowing ones got their XP fixed, it’s “normal” now instead of “boss level”, so each is probably only around 100xp now 
---
Yet so many people complain about people who shouldnt make a review because they only played for 3 hours. You can have fun in a bad game.
---
I wish. My boyfriend introduced me to Fallout, but he stopped playing after Fallout 3 and has no interest in playing 76 with me. He’s more interested in Destiny and Overwatch, but I can’t seem to get into those games. 
---
Ok killing dupers to remove them of their Junk is fine, but a bit toxic tbh..
---
Yes they didn’t earn it
---
Yes they abuse exploits
---
Yes they sell the items to boost their own caps
---
And yes they “ruin” the virtual economy 
---
But it’s a game can’t we all just have fun and stop worrying about dupers or glitchers and just enjoy the game for what it is
---
You. I like you.  Thank's for justifying my vendetta lol
---
If you're specifically looking for a behemoth, head directly west of Twin Lakes near Whitesprings. There's a guaranteed spawn behemoth in a pond just over the mountains. If you're looking for a giant sloth, just wander around treetops in the mire until one drops. There are usually 2 just hanging out over there unless someone has recently been through and killed them.
---
Probably already said, but some people either out their generators in easy to reach spots, or just don’t like people coming in when they aren’t there. This keeps danger on the *outside* of the camp until the player can deal with said problem, unless the enemy breaks a wall... or there’s people who think they should break someone’s walls/doors just because they wanted to explore.
---
I've stockpiled hundreds of stimpacks. I've resorted to selling them they are so plentiful. So I don't need any from Workshops.
---
The "white shag carpet", looks awful in-game.
---
This guy’s ^ seen some things 
---
There is a building in Harper's Ferry between the front (where you spawn in), and the vendor bot, that has a lot of display cases. Check alllll the display cases, the plans for the base armor and wet suit usually spawn there. You may have to server hop.
---
I drop ammo in a place people might find it.  I bulk, then sell excess junk.  I certainly don't hoard aid in my stash.. if i'm not going to use it on a regular basis, i don't need it.  And chems sell well.
---
I submitted a ticket, they told me that they cannot say one way or another. They linked me to the tos and code of conduct so I read those. I told them I would continue using mods and I listed mine for them. 
---
I feel like getting in touch with a community lead would be best, but I think right now they are being intentionally vague in the event that they have to do bans in the future for some reason. 
---
People can do as they please, but if I find a locked camp, I loot everything they have that isn't locked, regardless of whether I need it or not.  
---
Very good point I did little to no planning on this character. Thanks for your info! I'll review these threads for sure!
---
Other games on console do it though its not that difficult they have a partnership with microsoft its not like they would have a problem pushing updates through
---
Fair point. lt 
---
you need to update this, an instigating exploding shot gun could probably one shot you, but you can counter other explosive legendaries with the dense chest piece mod and fire proof. additionally you can further counter the damage with assasains/sentinel armor pieces.
---
I've noticed this. I quit the game to go take care of something earlier this week and relaunched it a while later and had it automatically rejoin my team. Was kinda cool, tbh.
---
EXACTLY!!!  I can find T-51 sure, but it was all maxed out.  And I found it organically following quests and doing activities. She weren't no farm raised T-51

Then my self  damn base began to disappear every log in, much to my dismay.....
---
I began building my base in seclusion, and found many peaceful logins.......
---
Accidentally purchased big ass RRocket from Atom Shop, but found it was epic.....
---
Began leading the masses back to my base, so they may gaze upon my giant Red Rocket in Awe....
---
All things balanced as should be.....
---
Uncle is very Happy I’m following in his footsteps .....
---
/dankmeme  material for sure. 
---
That explains literally everything, thank you!
---
Why would you play any MMO after launch since everyone else is already high level? Because you can catch up, duh. And it doesn’t take long to catch up in 76. The difference between 50 and 260 is... alternate perk cards. 
---
And equip farming at whitesprings is still the same, they just corrected the XP. Which again, doesn’t do anything past 50 other than give you alternate perk card options. 
---
How many do you know saw your base and left it alone? You'll never know.
---
Point is humans can be awesome or shit.
---
Level 120. Last night. Team effort.
---
Constant crashes during previous fights and the queen just flying away in the middle made it impossible to do until then. Didn't get a goddamn thing for it. Par for the course, really.
---
The last duping method didn't involve crashing the entire server it involved crashing yourself out during the server updating your save state. It required another person to stay in the server to act as an anchor to that specific server. The reason is because you have to retrive the items you put into a world container in order to now have multiples of whatever item your duping. So if everyone crashed out of the server there is no longer an anchor and imstead of double the items you just have whatever the original quantity was. 
---
If you are old enough to remember Pokemon Gold and Silver for the Gameboy Color it's a similar concept to cloning Pokemon and items. Crashing yourself out of the server is the equivalent to turning off the Gameboy midsave 
---
Very good counterpoint. I agree.
---
On a cliff on the eastside of the map with a leaddeposit and a black titanium nod :) 
---
Nice! Thanks for the loadout, I need to stop being such a hoarder and focus on killing skills.
---
Fog crawlers are guaranteed at the base of Tanagra Town if you can find it. It's directly south (slightly east) to the Abandoned Waste Dump. If you hit the river you've gone too far.
---
I’ve found maybe a half dozen TS weapons, but never any with explosive.  Plenty of nocturnal lead pipes or wood legs. 
---
My prize is still my level 45 TS handmade that dropped around level 47 or 48.  Slapped a drum mag on her and she has been my workhorse. 
---
Mostly plastic, it’s very well made for the most part. But some parts of the it are a little thin or brittle.
---
It’s a fun build though and looks fantastic.
---
Never before have I needed something so much and not known it. 
---
I haven't yet dropped my first Nuke (Level 84) but have been to lots of Blast Zones, and from what I've seen White Springs produces the most legendary enemies, and re-spawns. Charleston seemed to be the worst, I did find several legendary Ghouls &amp; Super Mutants in the DMV, but most glitched and were not Lootable.
---
Wavy Willards Water Park doesn't provide much for Flora/Flux, but did produce a lot of Legendary enemies, and it was a pleasant change from White Springs 6 times a day.
---
I'd like to get facts on what happens. Higher damage resistance, more hp, both, something else. Right now, it's all supposition from what I can tell.
---
But yeah, if you can't contribute, GTFO.
---
Ah.  Maybe it's a new mechanic to the system.  Since I don't think we are technically authorized to use the Emergency Drop system and are just loading requests we steal off of dead people.
---
To answer quickly, to the power armor, yes. It was more frequent before the patches but yes it still happens. 
---
For your 1st question. I don't remember crashing in Fo4, but I have a crash few others seem to experience in 76. 
---
So, I will be doing something, usually something too quickly the game doesn't like, it will make my main monitor go black (Its on Displayport plug if that matters) and the sounds will continue. I can't alt tab or move the mouse at all. My other monitors (on a seperate video card) will still show things on the screen but they will cease movement (if I am watching a video). The only way to get out of it is to do a full, hard reset of the machine. 
---
I have tried damn near everything short of formatting to fix it and I can't. 
---
Well if its anything like a mirelurk, hes a lil bitch. 
---
Or just let people play the game
---
What do you mean material node changes?
---
You arnt wrong 
---
It’s not supposed to but honestly I think he’s right because I had my luck at 3 until I hit level 70 and finally decided to spend my points. I upped the luck to 9 and I’ve noticed a significant difference in quality of loot drops. I’ve also noticed scorched drop 5 caps instead of 1-2 caps and vendors seem to spawn rare plans more frequently. 
---
But maybe it’s just happenstance.   
---
I started on an acid node, but once I realized the bulking bug I just kept stash of 100 at all times to make more when needed.
---
Moved to a junk pile, but decided it didn't provide enough to warrant the camp location.
---
Decided to just out my camp somewhere nice, ended near Charleston Station.
---
well thank you for correcting me. i was spreading misinformation. 
---
Starburst flooring. 
---
I thought it would look more... Idk vibrant? Or funkadelic? As soon as I put it down I knew I made a mistake lol. Super tacky and the yellow is just so grody. I think the design should smaller with more density. The yellow should be cleaner and perhaps a little brighter as well
---
Same, but the level doesn't say much to me anymore. So many people have alts. Their location on the map and behaviour often tells me more than level does.
---
I've also had my first full scale team fight last weekend. Despite the flawed pvp mechanics it was actually great. 3 vs 3 in the whole city of Watoga. We all just ignored the slapping mechanic and shot each other whenever they came in our sights. All 6 people we're high lvl and seemed to have seriously thought out builds. One guy had a low health build and I simply couldnt hit him hard enough. It was super fun, although I did finally see the explosive shotgun is too OP. One in our team sniped with that weapon (only expl, no two shot btw) from a ridiculous distance. I know little about guns but I don't believe shotguns are supposed to be the best sniper weapons. After 30 min they retreated, went to the nuke zone with the queen. We followed, other players came as well, but we there all just focussed on the queen and didnt continue pvp. Good times.
---
Hmmm, bummer.  I can probably get you some plans for a Single-Action Revolver Ivory Grip if that would help any.
---
Is speed demon still glitchy for anyone else?  
---
Mine seems to glitch out often... My melee build has agility 13 base (25+ w/ unyielding), 16 mutations (including speed demon and I use class freak),  and often enough I move MUCH slower than my agility 7 character... :/   
---
I have a nice set of mutations and don't really want to test this out by removing them again.... (I did remove speed demon about a month ago and my movement speed when back to normal).
---
30% more. 
---
how many people will be left playing still?
---
Just edit the doors to solid walls if for some reason you ever think you need to drop a set. 
---
I have zero windows on the ground floor. If I want to shuffle my armor around I edit the doors to walls. Yes, you can nuke it and all but at least I’ll get a few seconds warning.
---
I've done this one twice now, without the tracker both times.  Just find a deathclaw, kill it, look for a "deathclaw nest" nearby to loot for the meal 
---
I’ll interested in this, is this 100% volunteering or do we get rewards for this? Either way I’d like to help Appliacha 
---
That would be ideal
---
this is a bargaining tactic, perhaps the value is low and they want to see if you will offer to pay more than its worth.
---
This is my fun. They exploit, I steal their junk.
---
i found a bunch in and around watoga the other day.
---
Saw him in toxic valley 
---
Why would they make it so you can only kill the queen 1 time when most end game plans drop exclusively from her ? 
---
I’m level 80/81, and I’ve been helping randos that add me to their team for a few weeks now. I can honestly say it’s been super fun. I really enjoy the random acts of kindness being higher level is allowing me to perform.
---
You're welcome, good luck!
---
Omg I wish I had the chance to have a look at it so closely when I made my Folklore story video about the Flatwoods Monster! D: 
---
Anyone interested in watching a video of the legend of the Flatwoods Monster and some other in game footage as well, here is the link :D by yours truly.

If you can’t get one or it doesn’t work for you let me know. I’m on PS4 and you can have mine, I’ll likely never use it. 
---
Don’t we have enough of these?
---
That’s what I’m gonna do, but what a nuisance that fuckin tracker is, man. The spot jumps around while I stand still. I’ve had pretty good luck thus far with experiencing very few glitches, but this one is just making me feel stupid lol
---
It’s posts like this that reminds me how awesome this community is.
---
Are you on Xbox one? If you are I have a revolver ivory grip if you want it.
---
Then u may as well be the duper because your benefiting from it
---
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't bother reading past point 1.
---
Most high level players have explosive weapons at this point. You're basically saying avoid PvP.
---
And you don't even point out that you can use a dense chest mod and the new fireproof perk to overcome explosive weapons? ...weak.
---
I dont like that I cant do the only end game content without power armor. I hate power armor.
---
Thank god you have an inside track at bethesda and know they are simply ignoring this issue rather than having a difficult time figuring out a solution that doesn't break other things...
---
People originally accidentally phased in from a nuke and since then people figured out how to get in even on ps4
---
Eventually. It took until i was level 109 before i ran into this sucker. Weird thing is once my first encounter i've ran into them 2 more times within 20 mins. Haven't seen one in days now.
---
Ooh. Two nodes. Very sexy. 
---
Do you use them or mostly bulk and sell? 
---
Honestly, I just switched my 1 endurance perk to this.
---
Really? The two videos I saw which were alcohol review channels, not gaming channels, said it was horrible

There are quite a few fallout watch faces for Android wear. Used to have a traditional white watch face with  Vault Tec branding for a few months.

Please do! I'm just a solo player that farms nonnuked whitesprings 3x a week and as a result I sell all my excess wares because they take up valuable space. Ive been griefed countless times because I'm "duping". No you dumb fuck I'm selling crap to this player leave me, my base, and my customers alone. Id have way better shit then a hunters plasma Gatling if I was duping
---
Instead of farming the scrap, you get ore now. So you need acid to smelt the nodes. Changed a couple of patches ago. 
---
Yes. The actual plan names you are looking for are:
---
* Plan: BoS Combat Armor Arms
---
* Plan: BoS Combat Armor Legs
---
* Plan: BoS Combat Armor Chest Piece
---
Tip #1 to hold your own against even against the strongest players is literally avoiding them.
---
I’m not sure if the legendary effect will show the change. The perk cards to reduce armor will show a change, but gun magazines that reduce armor do not show a change 
---
It's mostly due to the fact that Bethesda shipped an unfinished product, I personally still like the game because I love Fallout 4, and this is VERY similar to it, but they need to do a much better job if they ever do another online game.
---
Inverting the Brick Walls = 1000 IQ house design

Damn!

My husband and I do. I'm the serious sniper build in matching camo armor while he's wearing a bathrobe and usually melees with a rolling pin or other.  We keep each other alive in Appalachia though (I only occasionally use him as a meat shield)
---
Not one time. I mean have done the quest to at least start I am become death. 
---
not for consoles
---
The "community" isn't some singular entity.
---
Yeah with the fix - I thought an acid node would be the most important thing to farm currently. 
---
That bug was fun while it lasted though. 
---
My friend and I came to rescue of a level 21 being harassed by a level 40 something who was just attacking his base and being a dick.
---
Afterward, I got a message from the level 21 thanking me for the help. I tend to try and help low levels with items and such, but really enjoyed gunning down someone being a dick 
---
The picture had 20,000 rounds before, someone posted the before and after pic. The op says he's said why the discrepancy but it's in the "messed up comments". Sounds like he's been caught out and is making lame excuses to me.

---
i keep being super disappointed by the lamps, but i keep spending my atom points on them. i guess because i'm a moron???
---
fish lamp: great concept, so 50s kitsch in every possible way. looks great in-game. *but the light is so bright.* i like my lighting to be warmer and dimmer, but this light is a crisp, neutral white and is like staring into the goddamn sun. 
---
ceiling fan: has a stupidly small power radius. sometimes clips into the ceiling and freaks the absolute fuck out?? like the fish lamp, it's *so. bright.* that issue is made even worse by the fact that it casts crazy shadows on the floor above if you place it downstairs in a 2-story camp. probably my biggest regret purchase overall, i literally never use it.
---
old possum sign: looks so good in game!! *so fucking bright.* i was hoping it would just be a vague glow like the other neon signs, but this is just blazingly, blindingly white. 
---
i really wish they would give us customizable lighting options. 
---
Invent a time machine, go back and set F76 launch date to Feb 2019 on the Bethesda project plan.

1400 a day selling mothman eggs to the 7 different vendors 
---
I wish there was a perk where if you get shot there was a small chance of finding the ammo type you got shot with embedded in your flesh and adding it to your inventory
---
Both of those reviews included attacks on Bethesda as part of their intros. And any simpleton with a YouTube channel is gonna know that hating of Bethesda will get more buzz than being positive. That Juicehead dude has made a career out of it.
---
Benefiting? I'm not keeping any of that. I don't want to spend my days walking.
---
I see a BoS arm/leg/torso plan there once every couple of days (I only visit the vendor once a day).
---
Snallygasters in the bog. :)
---
There's also old Hemlock Holes and you can sometimes get bonus Angler events for adhesive.
---
Just played for about 3 hours no disconnects, and load/fast travel seems way better. Just one server though...
---
The X-01 is an experimental armor, I don't think they would throw the President into an armor that they can't confirm will be able to step Left, Right instead of Left, Left, Right, Touch forehead.
---
Prepare for downvotes for spreading accurate info regarding duping in these parts. As you can see from my comment history it's toxic here even for us nondupers telling folks to pause and think for a moment
---
Sure people duping weapons and legendaries for money are shitheads but if you're just getting ammo for your own personal use then I'm actually not bothered by it. 
---
1.4k? How much are they with hard bargain max?
---
Ok
---
And gold/crystal ore galore in the cave up there too. Pain in the ass cave crickets though. 
---
I found 97 stimpacks in 1 crate and 96 bobbie pins  in another one.I was so confused. I am just level 8 and got the game a few days  ago.
---
"Plan: Missle Launcher"
---
Fo shizzle.
---
just hit level 68.. been to one prime nuke, I think I was like 50-55ish. It was fun, but the queen was not killed. I quickly learned that it was pointless for me to be there.  
---
I have since gotten a duped TSE lever, but I still haven't gone to another one. I am probably geared fairly decently for it now though so I probably should go again.
---
Treasure hunt....the plans are out there...👽
---
conversely i get a little sad every time i see the corpse of one of the vault 76 resident that died out in the wastes. 
---
How do you even know that, unless you check out the Xbox 1 dupe market? 
---
You know I just thought about the d-pad for the Stimpaks today. I’ve always pushed up and used the favorites but I remember in New Vegas and 4 that you you just hit the d-pad. So I will definitely have to update the build again when I get home. Thanks a bunch for the help!
---
I've seen a circle of teddy's sacrificing another teddy. I've seen Jangles driving a car. TreeTop House (or something like that) has some interesting Gnome locations. (and it's a great place for leather... and very very tall).
---
AHAHAHAH. Well, your reply was quite funny. I'll set a side the insult attempt. If you come from other MMOs, like WoW or whatever, where there were frequent nerfs, and you had a bad experience there, doesn't mean it's bad here. It's totally fucked the whole Explosion effect in PvP. Then some weapons make it plain stupid. I'm speaking about doing 5 times more damage. Since this is not a competitive game, nerfing a Legendary effect doesn't mean it will necessarily start some sort of a bad cycle. 
---
Sell to each of the 7 vendors each day. Make 1400 (minus travel cost). Try to sell items on the market.
---
For real tho. That oven is pure comedy. I couldnt even get mad at it.
---
It be fucking wonderful if you could create social hubs,  something like little slices of civilization created by players for setting up stalls to sell weapon, food etc. but the best way for that to work would be having server lists so that way you can return to the same hub and world every time you load in and not have to rebuild and place everything. Also, if you're on a specific server, the ability to favorite it and it saves the area where you set your camp so no one can build over your camp and you lose it, when you're logged out it could just lock that area so no one can build there or have a generic looking building so people know that spot is taken. 
---
I was always under the impression this meant someone else has requested a supply drop.
---
I’ll be home In roughly an hour will provide video then 
---
You get the Predator shimmer when in chameleon mode. Hard to see but not impossible. With a little practice you can still head shot them, were all the same size and dementions. 
---
I never said they did, but how they have handled patches is how other companies handle patching like Ubisoft. Last patch in RB6 there was a gun sight that was broken and un usable for like 2 months they waited to rollout the fix for the scheduled update when it could have been fixed in one day     
---
Actually, I tried crossing over the trees from the clifftop to get onto the rail just east of the lookout tower, and that first big tower has a big protrusion that makes it tough for anyone without a jetpack to get up on top of...is there another way up to the rail besides that?
---
What rdh727 said. The tracker is 100% useless, so much lag it actually makes it impossible to use. Just find a deathclaw then look for it's nest.  To see how bad the tracker is turn it off and you will still see it to continue updating the %!
---
What items are good to sell? I usually run out of stuff to sell by the first day of selling. 
---
👏 Good work. 
---
You should do the "Powering Up" events to try to get the Fusion Generator (100 power out put). I know that doesn't help you *now*, but maybe you won't have to use as much room and as many resources. I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
I also just got a response to my ticket.
---
&gt; While I can not say that you will or will not get banned for specific software or mods in use, I can let you know that if the game or ini files are edited, it may be a bannable offense.  Please keep in mind that most programs/mods that are used to change the game can cause this to occur.  Which is why it is not recommended to use software if you are not sure how it may effect it directly.
---
&gt;
---
So it looks like they are keeping their options open, but this sucks b/c it doesn't put at ease anyone using mods or reshade but honestly not trying to cheat/dupe/or ruin anyone elses experience in the game.  I would hope we could interpret this as "you might get caught in a ban wave for something, but we would reinstate you if it wasn't a malicious attempt to cheat/dupe/grief".  No way to know though.
---
It would be nice if there were just much fewer bagels. They could make them do way more damage so you actually had to dodge. 
---
In my PA I literally just stand still looking at the ground so I don't get epileptic fits while waiting for them to land.
---
I dont understand. Either you hate dupers for their affect on the servers or you dont,  the contents if what they are duping should have no bearing
---
So you think that there are people that only dupe ammo? And that it's a coincidence that this individual that may have duped ammo has been selling a lot of legendaries on Reddit?
---
No problem, oh and as an update dodgy DOES work in power armour however the other 2 don't. I just checked it out and it works, but it does make it harder to sprint up to enemies and power attack. 
---
I'm hanging on a cliff with a lead node overlooking Cliffwatch. The only real danger being taking off PA while in my c.a.m.p., in case my game crashes.  
---
Sounds like u/topokego beat me to it. That. Pretty much that. :)
---
Do you own it? If so could I ask a few questions? 
---
Logically, if she weighs the same as a vertibird...
---
damn I never, ever thought of this.  It literally never crossed my mind until this  post.  THANKS.
---
I keep thinking about this...the raiders in Fallout thing, and the difference is that in FO4 Raiders were either my level, or I went into an area I was not prepared to be in.  In FO76, the greifers RPing as Raiders are normally way OP compared to their victims, otherwise they would not greif them, because they really are not good at PVP, just good at buying duped gear and picking on way under leveled opponents. 
---
I noticed this is a good place for those random cryptid spawns. Got my sloth, mothman, another flatwood monster and fog crawler there. Just kept traveling back and forth every hour or so to see what spawns.
---
If you're talking about fov\* (pov = point of view?), that and dof have sliders, but no, you can do whatever you want in your custom.ini, don't worry about it
---
I would l like to be involved in some way. I myself am a noob tho.
---
Pick up every weapon from dead enemies and a bunch of resources. Bulked resources actually sell for a decent amount
---
You could be  a tailor and make Civil War, Witch or Skeleton costumes to sell. You could be a treasure hunter and get Cap Collector and Fortune Finder perks and hunt down the caps stashes. You could farm water at Workshops. Bulk materials you don't need and sell them to vendors. Lots of things you can do to make caps. 
---
Uhhhhhg, which wouldn't be an option if the person never claimed the workshop in the first place.  How can the attacker do anything if its an unowned workshop?  Honestly - head out your ass please.
---
Do you have proof and examples of this?
---
You may be right but it's very easy to say something like this. 
---
My experience from what I've seen around the place has been that it's slow and not as easy as you make out.
---
Alright.
---
You're not wrong. If you're not feeding lead to the queen or putting down mobs so the people who are doing the heavy hitting stay clean, GTFO.
---
Probably when I got extra stoned and bought the "green boy " icon of a plasma goo pile with the vault boy smile on it. Made me laugh way too hard when I saw it.
---
yeah the brick looks way homier, while the concrete has that sterile functional look. Inverting the walls actually gives you more floor space as well. the one problem with brick on the inside is that you can't hang posters without the brick clipping through the posters
---
Yup, I’m seeing that right now. And I’m actually watching the objective area move around the map. Smh
---
Yep! That's the state of the game at the moment. But it's only because the OP two shot and explosive round weapons are spreading around in vast numbers. As soon as these weapons are removed from PVP, things will improve drastically.
---
There are higher level players that refuse to use these guns (I'm one of them), and against these guys, pretty much any player has a chance as long as they know the basics.  
---
You must be some sort of game programming guru.
---
You need 175 mothman omelettes  to sell to the 7  vendors. 25 per vendor just go to point pleasant get the eggs do that 5 times then use super duper to make more I always have extra. 
---
Thanks a lot,  while playing the game I might have see it,  but never bought it. Ugh, that what happens when you are new and barely nobody tells you anything
---
Wow that is amazing, going to try it out now.
---
Oh the irony given OP is a duper himself/got this and ammo from a duper.
---
Fuck. Yes.
---
Seen some good updates in this patch, but I almost cried when I didn't see a fix to this. I literally have about 10K caps I am holding on to just to buy plans once this happens!
---
My base is laid out so that all the crafting stations are on a kind of “porch” facing the road, and that anyone can come in through the front door to use a common room and bed. The only doors I lock are a back door to prevent enemies from sneaking in, and the door to my character’s bedroom on the second floor, just because it made sense.
---
usually no its just full pvp in workshops so if you want to its possible without slap damage being a thing.
---
Yeah for sure there's a difference.  To be clear these researchers publish their research.  They don't say "hey software x.y.z is bugged, avoid it".  They just give the company enough time to implement a fix.
---
Youtubers are immediately spilling all just go get views.  They should be banned.  It's probably not enough though.  I feel like they should have been actively deterring exploits while implementing fixes the whole time.  Its probably too late to start banning everyone though.
---
I mean...it would be Mom, if I had kids.
---
This is so wildly unrealistic a situation for how duping works works in-game. Your entire nonsense hypothetical would require the duper to go through and use every single power core individually to some degree and even if they managed to do that there's still no object to actually render so the server load wouldn't be more then a few lines of text so to speak.
---
I have found some available at the following vendors: Harper's Ferry, Welch Station, and Camden Park
---
I have definitely dabbled in mutations, but have barely scratched the surface on which ones will benefit my characters current perks/weapons. I just learned about the different vendors, so I've begun earning caps unloading stuff and picking up new recipes. I'm getting there!! Today's adventure is to explore the Watoga Shopping Center!
---
I‘ve just settled there but I‘m probably gonna use most of it :) 
---
I‘m building a really nice camp rn both secure and beautiful I‘ll post it in here when it‘s done :) 
---
She killed about everyone she grew up with, kid was a tad out of wack.
---
theoretically i can get maybe 4 more if i dump my artillery and just leave the purifiers exposed on the outside
---
that or log immediately as your camp will log of with you.
---
not much you can do with a mini nuke out of nowhere.  Pacifist mode should be extended to our Camps making all damage to it 1 per hit.  
---
I called it a figurative boss, because people are randomly nuking for special mutated endgame content and "cool, high level enemy" didn't seem to kick as a title. 
---
Potential spoilers here, but it's better than my attempt.  I never even got to put in a code.  I got all the way to launch prep and the bot that starts the prep never moved, not in the 20 minutes I waited, thus progress never increased and additional bots never spawned.  The attackers kept coming, though.  Finally after waiting 30 minutes for anything to happen, I just gave up and let the assaultrons take me out.   It was singularly the worst experience I've had in the game and has really turned me off from trying again.    That was a tremendous amount of wasted time.   I'll just let other people do the nuking from now on.
---
I agree when it comes to others trying to pvp you. It makes it ridiculous. The best weapon i have is an explosive with does extra damage to ghouls which is nice but it is also a single shot black powder pistol. Which means you have to be fairly close to use and is slow to load a second shot. That's the kind of balance explosive weapons need. 
---
got 1 off a SM last night in west tek.....two shot + 50% more damage vats critical... its awesome and it's mine
---
blood DK tanking ICC and ele shamy were my mains
---
Probably around 300 people were near my base, of which 150 probably used, of which probably 15 were negative. Your point is correct. 
---
It definitely is not intended to harass and destroy. If the other player doesn't wish to engage, that's not "working as intended.
---
There absolutely was something to it. The thing was people were getting their items "taken". As in they were no longer showing up. But then a couple hours later they'd be back. That's how and why the "myth" got started.
---
So it wasn't actually happening, but people's items were disappearing from their inventory due to it
---
Lol I love that lil lamp. It kind of pulses or shimmers too, cool little effect
---
You can find and use level 15 Raider Power Armor. I would be looking at "The Crosshair":
---
https://fo76map.com?locationIds=993
---
It spawns the lower level armor here, you may need to server hop a couple of times if it is not there or if you need more pieces.
---
Oh, make it 2. You don't happen to also have Ultracite Explosive Vents or a Radium Rifle, do you? I'll finally achieve my dream of being overencumbered with just repeat plans. :P
---
It will get there. 
---
&gt;Aside from an absolute murder by words I sent him about him having to watch his mother die
---
Seriously?  Over loot in a game?  I bet he was not so much murdered by words but more entertained by your ridiculous overreaction.
---
Give it a few months and people will have found something new to latch on to and obsessively hate.
---
The fact that there other causes of server stability issues doesn't mean that duping doesn't cause server stability issues.
---
In fact, the server stability issues you experience spamming buttons while crafting are related to the ones abused to dupe items.
---
This is all super useful info. I think I've found most of what I need from the Poseidon Event except for the fusion 
---
Yeah I'm level 48 and I have a executioners gatling waiting for me
---
For exp wes tek general steakhouse farm super mutants also big bend tunnel.
---
I wonder if people are still rolling their eyes at everyone with a hazmat suit on. I'm fairly tanky for a non PA build , damage output is decent too.
---
I think they need to do away with the Global PVP aspect of the game and focus on pvp events.  
---
Like king of the hill type events that people can participate in that occur in different areas of the map.  I am sure they could come up with some creative ideas for pvp events, even something with your CAMP. But i guess it might render the bounty system null but really its a good idea but too many variables for people to mess up or exploit like this team of real in game raiders that you encountered.
---
I logged in yesterday (mon 14th) on xbox and did one messenger event starting in the savage divide that ended in the forest and got all the savage divide outfits from that table you have provided.
---
I don’t think so. You probably need a jet pack or the marsupial mutation to hop over the pylon in between. I have both so I didn’t notice that it was a problem. 
---
Wait until endgame buddy, you will see why it is trash.
---
Were those people below level 5? 
---
How much does 1 egg cost
---
... I don’t understand what that’s relevant to?
---
Dupers ain't getting it?  Ironic that it appears a duper already has it.
---
My recent response from Bethesda regarding Reshade includes the possibility of banning for almost any mod, dll, or even INI file entry that could change the game.
---
&gt; While I can not say that you will or will not get banned for specific software or mods in use, I can let you know that if the game or ini files are edited, it may be a bannable offense. Please keep in mind that most programs/mods that are used to change the game can cause this to occur. Which is why it is not recommended to use software if you are not sure how it may effect it directly.
---
We have been pushing it for abit now.

No idea how they can exactly but Ebay is not the only site covering them. 100s of these seller websites exist with one click on google. Heck one of the was a google paid ad. 
---
Trying to push a trade and then stalking somebody is a great way to really find out if they have one those explodey guns that just tell slap damage to fuck right off.
---
G'head, Try that.
---
Really?  It's the only legendary gear in the game that you can upgrade levels on, also only gear I'm aware of that you get set synergy.  Looks goody, however it's pretty nice for stealth builds.
---
I never accept invites,  hell sometimes I'll switch servers if the conversation starts to get weird with someone heh. Can't catch me griefers!  
---
Revenge and Murder?  Log in for the day.  Forgot I had logged at Whitesprings.  I log into a nuke zone.  CRAP!  Die before I can get my hazmat suit on.  I am heading back to get my stuff and see a message my bag was looted.  Pop open my map real quick and see 2 people by my death icon.  Luckily someone had a base right by there and BOTH got accidentally  flagged for PVP while shooting ghouls.  2 shot Dragon to the face for them both.  Who took my stuff?  I don't know.  One kill was revenge.  One was murder! I was 20 caps richer with even more junk.  A good day. 
---
fiction.  sorry.
---
I spotted some glowing green shit in a cluster of glowing orange mushrooms. The moral of the story is: go out at night without the tracker and look for it on sight alone. If anyone else is having this issue, it’s fairly close to the fast travel spawn point of the Crevasse Dam, along the side of the road by the swamp.
---
Have this issue too. You have to scrap entirely and replace. I used the  swap feature with a wooden shack wall at 60% for brick and the HP carried over. I really don't want to have scrap and replace due to having a lot of wall Deco already all over it.
---
I honestly think it's really sad that we have to beg for such a simple rpg mechanic.
---
But yeah. I would be too.
---
I'll carry anyone :)
---
Update was pushed back to Tuesday, almost immediately after the announcement of the patch.
---
Actual im not my area of expertise is Criminal Justice I just assumed that Bethesda would know how to fix an issue that has plagued there games for 14 years. But I will concede that it did happen over the Christmas holidays so they have probably been short staffed  
---
There are still good Caps stash farming routes, just search Youtube.
---
Yeah... I wish I could repair things one piece at a time, or use the repair all option whenever I wanted or like you pointed out just make it where it repairs everything in the camp. 
---
It's a bug, I've talked to 2 different people that had the same issue, I'll PM you
---
Do the mobs increase with time or with player characters?
---
&gt;I had zero issues when I first started playing and it's just got worse the higher level I got
---
Same.  
---
Also, you're getting a BSOD? What's the error code?
---
oh rofl, I was going to say.
---
Why would any mule need to carry thousands of any item? When would any normal player ever need that much, other than a couple high consumable junk items (lead, acid, steel) or ammo?

Multiplayer balance always begins with nerfing of overpowered.  It has for 20 years of competitive or collaborative gaming.  It will here also.  Doesn’t mean I approve or disapprove I’m just stating a fact that explosive weapons will be nerfed. 
---
...Right.
---
You have the same thing with dupers on here.  I mean how many of the tse items or serums are obtained by exploiting the game.  Even if they fix duplication glitches people will continue to sell items.  And players that don’t want to spend hundreds of hours farming are going to buy.  I’d say the glitch itself (since it lags the game) and griefers are going to cause people to leave not the items themselves.  I really don’t care how other players play the game as long as my play isn’t affected.  Can you blame people who work 60 hrs a week with two kids for pay five dollars for a gun vice spending ever night for the next two months farming it?  It’s the way the game is set up.  I don’t think it’s likely to change any time soon.
---
Jesus it's even worse than I thought. I thought if they had their legal team threaten Ebay it would fix the matter but if they got more of these sites its gonna take alot of legal threats to shut them down.
---
On my second character I picked up this Vault Tec U outfit (not a jumpsuit) as an early quest reward. I definitely didn't get it on my first character but I'd love to get it for my original character if anyone knows how to find it.
---
Maybe I'm using the wrong search terms but I can't even find a pic of it online.
---
sick but it would surely be x-01 ;)
---
I play a huge amount of pvp because I avoid players that use these weapons! Not every player has them, or is prepared to use them all the time. But it's true, the amount of people that have them is a huge problem. 
---
I've not used these perks yet so don't know how effective they are. Only if they effectively make the OP guns useless are they worth bothering with.  
---
The only people that argue with Tip 1, are the kind of players  that utterly rely on these OP god-weapons because they are so powerful. And they are exactly the kind of players that should be avoided. Thanks for letting everyone know that YOU are one of these unskilled dudes. 
---
I bought that one from somebody
---
Hell even banning their accounts they'll make more. Especially for the amount of money their making.
---
Here's my thought. Strangler vines are all a single organism, kinda like hive-mind scorched.
---
Take a look around The Mire and you'll notice something strange. Outside of workshops or ambient piles, there is *0 wood* to be acquired from fallen trees. Literally not one. Even the fallen trees and stumps are covered in vines. *Everything is alive*. We have mirelurks, ghouls, all sorts of things that can be strangled enemy. We have the Lucky Hole mine Lovecraftian esque vine monster that's growing *human features* after the sacrifice of human cultists.
---
Wouldn't doubt that 94 *introduces* a new sort of big bad, it not just being a dungeon to explain the Mire.
---
At least I hope so. Really want an explanation for the 0 wood strangler vine party and the what the fuck creature in that mine.
---
&gt; as well as Banning and removing those players from the economy forever
---
R.I.P Fallout 76 then, banning the majority of players on an already struggling game.
---
You know, you should exercise more. Don't drive to the local store. Walk there. It'll be good for your health. Who knows who you'll meet and see along the way. Wet weather and harsh sun are an experience. It builds character. You get too complacent driving around in your air-conditioned vehicle with the music player playing exactly what you want to hear...
---
Son of bitch i am watch holy grail on Netflix's right now

guys I can only play 10 minutes a week, let me buy everything. I have 20 kids I need to support,  give me those duplicated items now &gt;:(

Did you put a sign up saying "Please don't break" ? Cause that's about all you can do in an sandbox multiplayer
---
OP is also now sending hate messages since he got called out on it LOL.

...so? Before I started really using my ultracite .50 I stacked up 20k, used about 3-5 in a busy day of whitesprings and the precursor nuke run. Now I try to keep close to 50k.
---
The game is so easy and so quickly completed that it was pretty easy to just use melee and farm materials for a few days to get my main stockpile up. Now I just put it away and pull out melee for a while if I need to replenish so...
---
This is just like people thinking high levels must mean they are glitching. Some folks genuinely are better than you and have invested more time. That does not equate to everyone with better shit than you being an exploiter or bug abuser.
---
40k ultracite .50 rounds at level 200? Nothing suspicious at all about that, it describes the majority of my group of friends that play.
---
If the player in question has more than 5-10 bobbleheads of a given type, then you should be suspicious. Most of the other shit is the result of having no life.
---
Why are you adding the caveat “for money”? Not everyone who has duplicated period?
---
With the amount it's happened I should probably have memorized the error code but I'm not sure what it is. Any of the other issues I can ignore coz the games so fun but these damn blue screens just kill it. It usually happens.when I'm looking or using a stash
---
I have. I usually only keep 5 of each drug (I've droppped that to 2) and no longer keep mentats. I store some non-expirable food but then use it when I plan to go adventuring for a while. I almost never use my stimpaks, but I keep them just in case.
---
I get mine a welch station

Ok, then we can make the robot suck up most of the radiation around it making it easier for non power armored players.

---
Never. I haven't seen them say anywhere that they are deleting every item ever duped. Not only that, I'm pretty sure they can't track that. 
---
Tbh I would say why not. I am a hoarder also. I just kept taking stuff. So I totally understand them having thousands. Plus I got thousands of mats too at my mule. 
---
Good boy
---
I never said it was easy just that it shouldn't have taken almost 2 months too patch in especially since the issue is so game breaking, Whats the point on working on player vending when your in game economy doesn't exists because of Duplication every resource should have been pulled off what ever they where doing to fix the issue immediately sure it might have delayed the vaults by a couple of weeks but a huge chunk of the player base has left because of the server instability from duppers

I've been finding Trapper mod plans at the Red Rocket station in the Mire by Harper's Ferry. They spawn on the very bottom of the first yellow magazine stand you see. It is in the building *next* to the Red Rocket. Be prepared to fight a boss. There is also PA that spawns in the back. Good location.
---
The Committee for Un-Bethesdan activities is already on the case, Senator McHoward will show those red scoundrels how we treat commie scum!
---
What’re you looking for? I have a calibrated shock
---
It's definitely due to other things as well, but considering the whole duping thing is overloading the server, it's a safe assumption that's a big cause of it. Especially when you see how many items are on ebay and how much they're going for
---
I'm out in the middle of nowhere so if I ever catch anyone making their way to my house I just immediately server hop. Gotcha scum bags.
---
Sponging off other people's work is a shitty way to play. If you're lower level but outside shooting things, I have less problems, but if you're only hiding except to plink at the sbq to ensure loot, you're a leech. Go away.
---
Do yourself a favor and play something else lol
---
Duplication is too far spread to delete every item ever duped. Let alone the fact that they have no way of knowing what items are dupes. So they actually cannot do what you're saying. Banning dupers is good but they need proof, otherwise their hands are tied.
---
This. True for all weightless equipment. It only applies to the base item weight, not mods
---
Do they have one? Cus I totally would! 
---
Level 165 no quests done on xbox live here brah
---
Yes I do and yes you can.
---
Also, I appreciate the comment and upvote. I thought people may think it was a soapbox or just too long. It was very well thought out after it kept happening last night. I'm just glad I'm not the only one that thinks this way.  
---
that will be the real reclamation day.
---
Yes. Well aware. Preface bc I don't know how much the patch improves server performance. But I'll go out on a limb and say I assume my game will still freeze daily after tomorrow.
---
Is this a rhetorical question? 
---
You can buy a tse gun on a subreddit for caps easily. This game doesnt make it impossible to make caps either. Buying it for real money is bad line to cross because your encouraging both a crime and making it harder for other people to play. If you can't play long enough to be able to grind caps for an hour or so then maybe you shouldn't be playing an online game that requires it.
---
With charactet levels.
---
We go out &amp; collect as much of anything we can, scrap then bulk. Sell the excess bulk. There are a few items you can sell that can't be bulked, like gold or antiseptic.  We also sell excess weapons from whatever areas sweeps we do at any of the various spawn areas on the map.  
---
Just as a suggestion.  Not sure what else you're trying.  
---
Whats the link? Why should we believe this isn't a troll post
---
Sell stuff to vendors, the sre separated into 6 different faction. Each faction has 200 caps.
---
TBH I nutted
---
Not if characters are banned and deleted. They will lose inventory and they are patching duping tomorrow on the console
---
Hmm but apparently it doesn't work with 1 piece and goat legs.

Dammit don't make me laugh this is super serial! 
---
I guess we should just open up the dev room for everyone huh, maybe make reward system for people who glitch,hack or scam other playrs?
---
You should. Even if you don't hurt the queen, you could easily take out mobs.
---
Anything that can buff the carry weight or armor defense because I always get overwhelmed when I’m on the Mire or Bog
---
I can usually tell if the group is able to take down the SBQ within the first 5 minutes. Last night about a group of 8-9 could barely make a dent. I think there was about 5 minutes left before even reaching the first half HP mark. I just focused on the mobs instead. 
---
&gt; Bethesda didn't put enough effort into a fairly stable game on release.
---
Id only disagree here on the grounds that they basically... no literally rammed netcode into their engine that was literally never designed for it, and managed to make it work reasonably well, all things considered.
---
It wasn't perfect, or even great by any stretch of the imagination, but it more or less worked.
---
Not saying that excuses the state it was in or anything.
---
Bethesda games are always buggy at launch. And I'm of the opinion most online multiplayer games are always buggy at launch. What we got was better than I was expecting.
---
I bet if they dug hard enough in the data  they could follow the bread crumbs.
---
It should be but it says T60
---
Absolutely agree
---
Hey, do you normally send private messages like this to people?

You think you know it all huh? I’ve literally never duped. You make bold assumptions but you’re totally wrong, what a cunt you are.
---
Calibrated shock is the one that buffs carry weight
---
I saw where that could be read incorrectly. Lmao.
---
Yet to test these perks, but they need to be bloody mega to balance this shit out. 
---
The sentinel armour is a point, but not a good one. These pieces of armour are very rare, so what do you do in all the time that you are trying to collect them?? Tips are aimed at players that are lower-levelled, so what sense does it make to say "wait until you play the game for a few more hundred hours to find the right stuff and you'll be fine"
---
For me the bounty is *consistently, every single time* cut in half if and when I fast travel to the person.
---
I have not tried walking and seeing if it happens when I get close.
---
Easy 200 plastic at watoga  high school if you can live with the ghouls and clear both floors of the cafeteria.   There are 7 can traps at Camden  park.
---
Yeah I'm getting a lot of hate PMs from him. 
---
These guys dont work alone. Its usually a team and they all have inventory. Plus it's already been confirmed that their only patching one dupe method. Apparently there are various other methods that are unknown that they haven't patched out.
---
I have entered people's locked camp rooms.   I'm not a griefer, so I left their camp alone (well, maybe I helped them harvest their vegetables).    So, how about just ending that sentence with "I will never drop an entire chassis again."   That is how you keep it safe.
---
The last time I was inside someone's locked multi-level condo, they arrived while I was there, didn't see me, and left the door wide open.   While they were standing at their workbench, I walked out the open door right behind them.   The only sign I was there was my footsteps.  That and I walked right by one of their teammates who might have seen me, but hard to say because of the angles.   TL;DR:   It's fun being nosey and looking around at other people's designs.   Especially when you realize just how easy it is to bypass a locked door when there are windows.
---
Did you end up finding it?
---
I know you can get them at Harper’s Ferry and Welch but I didn’t know about Camden. Is it rare?
---
The hidden knowledge is revealed...
---
Love when patches line up with my day off
---
Infinite until you put it away or the server catches up. I had that happen last night. It broke during a fight, I forgot after a few minutes and hit the hot key, got it back, finished the fight... few minutes later once loot started loading in on bodies, it “rebroke”
---
It'd be a nice QoL adjustment if damaged objects, not destroyed, slowly regened themselves over time.
---
Now, don't take my word for this, but I think Bethesda punishes for any mods. 
---
Where’d you find it?
---
I got lucky with both my T60 and T51 set at Emmet's Mountain Disposal. It had the final pieces I was looking for both (on separate mutation farming trips). 
---
Hotkey coffee and Nuka cola quantum 
---
Nice, you will find the Brotherhood of steel trading robot there. But if you haven't finished the quest 'mayor for a day,' the watoga robots will be hostile to you. In this area enemies spawn to a high lvl if there are high lvl players near the location, making it potentially quite hard for your lvl.
---
There's a safer to get to trader in the watoga station you should also visit. If you then carefully sneek from the station, between the busses, jump over the fence, go right and then first street to the left you have the best chance to not alert the robots and do some peaceful trading in the shopping center with the BoS trader. I haven't sneeked succesfully from any other direction thus far. 
---
If you plan on a long playing session, consider taking a workshop. Not only can you produce resources there, but it also spawns regular defence events that reward you with stimpaks, purified water, junk and 1 plan for your camp. If you're busy and do not want to defend, you can just let it pass and a new event, to retake the workshop from ghouls/mutants/scorched etc. will spawn, giving the same rewards, but with slightly harder enemies. You can also be challenged for your workshop by players, but that doesn't happen often.
---
haven’t been able to check today, i’ll let you know if i find it but i checked a few times straight after and couldn’t see a thing :(
---
Blue screen is to do with your hardware and not the game itself, but that's none of my business.
---
I'm promoting WHO now? Why come to a forum if you don't want to discuss topics? 
---
I was under the impression that they were banning people who had "Cheat Engine" installed. I could be wrong, though. 
---
I bought the plan from the Harper’s Ferry vendor. It seems to be very rare though as that was the only time I saw it. 
---
Really?
---
If you have a bounty, you are open game. I got wanted yesterday at a level 11’s camp. (I’m level 57) I was giving him ammo and water. When he asked about my gun, I pull out my tse handmade rifle and fired at a far away rock.....instantly wanted. I asked him to kill me and then came back for my junk.
---
This^^^^^ 
---
Lol, I'm kind of jealous I didn't get one after all my replies on here.
---
Junk and Water.  Life is good.

Near Watoga in a creek bed is a group of gnomes surrounding a skeleton. One of them might have had a knife.

I think something should be done to the fact that players can just make mule accounts that get banned and their main account with all the stuff is untouched
---
I’m a heavy build. I use 2 explosive Gatling and an explosive.50 cal. My Gatling plasma is used for regular s itch beasts because you can aim it better than Gatling laser and it will melt them out of the sky. With max weapon artisan I get 4-5 cores out of it before it breaks 
---
That's a bit odd to be sure, all I know is that it's working with 2 armor items :)
---
I can prolly test a bit with goat legs, if it works for me then perhaps the user in that vid had a bugged item or something...
---
I missed that, quest items don't spawn outside of quest.  
---
You're not farming Whitesprings for the best gun possible. Clearly wasting your time with end game. Back of the bus, casual.
---
Its not a cool special mutated enemy, you can literally find them everywhere at The Mire and Cranberry Bog
---
Additional information sure. They could start by differentiating plans by names first. See if they can do that without causing bugs. After that, create *plan known* indicator on the names on the trade UI. See how many patches that require. Lastly, a button to show tooltip for the item. That will take them half a year.
---
As soon as they finish installing the giant ban button in there server rooms. There is some hold up on what height it's going to be installed at.
---
Your post was all they needed. I'm sure they'll patch it immediately now.

I was but a lowly level 21 when I saw a Nuclear target appear over my Camp. "Cool!" I thought to myself, "I will get to participate in all the Nuke fun!" 5...4...3...2...1...touchdown. "Need my hazmat suit, let me see if I can fast travel to a Nuke Zone. GREAT I CAN!" And i fast travelled just in time to witness my entire camp erupt into explosions and flames before my eyes. I did not get my hazmat suit.  I did not pass go. I died. 
---
Well.. that's a surprise 
---
You trying to promote exercise? The hells wrong with you? Why walk when you can just pay caps? It's not like you're gonna need 'em anyway.

They banned a lot of people for using mods on PC. The only thing I am pulling out of my ass is your head.
---
How does one make containers lootable by other players? I  always seem to have excess stash and loot is love to make available to passerby’s rather than drop. Thanks!
---
There are different letter plans yes. Youll have to write it on a wall or something but go for it lol . I hope its effective :-P
---
&gt; I'm seriously curious, how long can Bethesda piece this quilt together before people just find a better blanket?
---
Are you actually asking a question?  Because the answer will be different for every player.  Lots of people don't care about "end game" because the journey is what is appealing.  Some people rush the journey and linger at the endgame for 98% of their time.
---
Nobody can answer this unanswerable question because nobody knows how each player will react.  It's only been two months, and the game could run for years and have a rebirth in July if Bethesda delivers a lot of improvements.
---
There's no monthly fee.  People who played at launch can fire up the client a year later and play.  You can complain about the current state of the game, but it's not like people who quit will never come back.
---
&gt; Either people don’t understand how these types of games work or Bethesda has created some kind of bizarre system that makes absolutely no sense.
---
Or you're just an idiot and don't understand what you're talking about
---
There are still a ton of bugs that have been in the game since day 1. Not a day goes by that I can't play with my girlfriend because some bullshit bug in the social menu. Some days it can't sync our friends lists. Usually the game just lies and says we aren't online when we are. Or it just decides to not give either of us the option to add the other to a team. Sometimes we are on a team but when we are in the server neither of us can fast travel to the other's camp. Sometimes we make it to the same server but can't be on a team, and then the game forgets we are friends so we can't fast travel to each other. Once we were on a team at the main menu, but when we loaded in we were no longer on a team, because the dumb fucking game put us on separate servers! Still baffled by that bug. Server and game stability are still shit. I have yet to play a session since beta that hasn't crashed multiple times, whether it was the server crashing again, or just the entire game itself crashing. Multiple times my game would just crash as soon as the server loaded, over and over and over again. Took an hour for it to resolve itself the first time, every other time I gave up and played another game after the third crash in a row. Then there are the infinite load screens that Bethesda only fixed for PC. I'm on Xbox, and I'm starting to get them now. 15 minutes and I'm still loading? WTF Bethesda. This game has crashed more for me than the last three Fallout's combined already. No joke. And I modded the shit out of those games with many incompatible mods. Bethesda is ignoring our bug reports. They lied about fixing bugs (I've been stuck in Power Armor twice after they claimed to fix it with the December 4th patch, and I'll be damned if I'm going to believe they will be fixing it AGAIN with the patch tomorrow). Lied about nerfs. No, sorry, they just "forgot" to list them in the patch notes. Lied about the bag. This game deserves all the hate it gets. I'll continue to hate on it until bethesda gets their act together. They've yet to do that. Until I see every bug from beta fixed, servers capable of handling trades without a error message, and I can get through a couple hours of play without a single crash, then I'll stop hating. I'm not holding my breath for any of that happening anytime soon. It's been two months. The game is less stable than it was during the Beta, which is mind boggling. I know lots of people will chime in saying they hardly crash. Good for them, but Bethesda doesn't know how to have a consistent experience across multiple platforms for an online game, which is why some people have a shit ton of problems while others are lucky and don't. My girlfriend and I are some of the unlucky ones, and as a consequence will continue to hate until bethesda can figure it out. Oh, their support is shit too, one time I couldn't connect and for once it actually gave an error message. I tell them the error message, they tell me to uninstall and reinstall. Turns out random people on the internet figured out how to connect after receiving that specific error message, and it did NOT require wasting my bandwidth re-downloading a 50gb game. Who knew? Not Bethesda, and it's their game!
---
A common and unhelpful mistake as you can see by the other silly reply's before you. 
---
I play a huge amount of pvp because I avoid players that use these weapons! Not every player has them, or is prepared to use them all the time. But it's true, the amount of people that do currently use them is a huge problem. 
---
The only people that argue with Tip 1, are the kind of players  that utterly rely on these OP god-weapons because they are so powerful. And they are exactly the kind of players that should be avoided. Thanks for letting everyone know that YOU are one of these unskilled dudes.  
---
If everyone dropped these rubbish things because of how toxic they are the for the game, the entire pvp experience would be worlds better. 
---
I ban these OP guns in the pvp matches I arrange (which are open-to-all), the gameplay is so much better because the fights are varied and last a lot longer. 
---
Cool, report to bethseda and go on with your life. The white knighting post are just attention seeking
---
My camp is on a carrot flower :) lol
---
They are probably coming lol. Someone can only rage so fast over a keyboard, ya know?
---
That perk isn't like that yet on console
---
For XP server hopping would work better, but nuke zones are still better for loot. You dont get glowing mass, high rad fluid, etc from standard ghouls and glowing ones spawn as legendary more often
---
Get the green thumb perk and go in Nuke zones. Collect all the flora and sell it quickly (before it spoils). With hard bargain rank 3, you can get about 11 caps each. I scoured damn near every inch of a fissure prime nuke and found about 160 flora (with green thumb). 
---
Cute... 
---
*If only I had real friends....*
---
Hey man, we’re all noobs until we eventually aren’t.
---
Yeah, if you write it down next time maybe I can help you figure out what's going on.
---
The sad thing I see the "wipe everything" mentality and idea running rampant in this sub 
---
That's really how it should feel at the start tho. As you progress and get better perks and more importantly know the go to spots for ammo, it becomes much much more manageable.
---
I hate pvp so I always stay on passive even on my lvl 41 alt. anyway I was out doing my own thing while grouped with a level 17 buddy who claimed the food processing plant when a level 37 and a 72 came rolling up, killed him once and started to take over the collection site from him. 
---
Taking passive off (blech) a couple well placed daisycutter nukes at the claim point (I was carrying 6 nukes on my person since I loathe to junk ammo and my stash was full) the level 37 left the main room to the outside. 
---
The lvl 17 in his raider power armor took out the level 37 once and the level 72 three times (both in power armor) without dying. Weapon scaling makes a huge difference. (It didn't hurt that I only make medic builds for this game with a modest stockpile of stimpacks -189 regular, 56 super- and I was spamming the self-stim button and tracking his movement while turtling up indoors and hugging the wall to get in range)
---
Being a massive hoarder I have resources for days - Emptied out the vendors for caps and still had bulk resources left over with 10 bulk of almost every resource in my stash -  when they tried the alternate strategy of taking out the base turrets the repair all button timed to when they were just at the point of making progress wore down their resolve and eventually left the server. 
---
Sometimes it's just about making it not worth the effort at the cost of their resources. The mysteries outfit looks ugly as sin but it helps save on the cost of ballistic fiber to fix my leather armor.
---
i only lock up the fusion core generators.  If I gotta spend 30 mins fixing a power plant or building a fusion power generator, I want to make sure I get as many cores out of it as I can. 
---
I couldnt care less about everything else
---
Would be good to know. And it's good to know 2 pieces work also. Thanks.
---
I really just like the power armour giving a guy bunny ears, thats hilar
---
It gets better as you level up, perks start becoming available that allow you to craft ammo in very large quantities. 
---
My advice would be to stick to strong melee weapons at low levels, or ask a friend for ammo. Ammo is quite scarce to begin with in any Fallout game.
---
Are you making your own rounds yet?
---
Try visiting Camp McClintock, there are many boxes of ammo laying around, and several ammo crates to search
---
 Ik would also like to know.
---
You can make ammo at a tinkerers workbench.
---
Here's an alternative: Bethesda could just... Not charge 18 dollars for a texture.
---
8 industrials would still only proc 1 water per minute but would allow you a capacity of up to 40 waters, if you had an industrial, a medium and a large, the industrial would proc every minute and fill up only industrial purifiers, the large would proc every 2 minutes and only fill the large purifiers and the medium would proc every 3 minutes and only fill up mediums.
---
I do get what your saying though, if you get 1 water / minute with an industrial after 40 mins you should have 40 water, the only thing I can think is, its not actually 60/hr or there is a small chance every time it procs that you dont get water.
---
You should get into crafting your own ammo.  The Ammosmith perk + Super Duper help.
---
Oh boo hoo how dare people enjoy themselves in different ways than me! I'm surprised you didn't call me a noob while you were at it this is so funny, I hate using guns, can't aim for shit, so I just try to make friends with the feral ghouls instead :D 
---
I liked the suggestion that fast travel should deplete hunger and thirst meters based on the distance traveled... make it seem more like we're taking an actual trip rather than paying for teleportation. 
---
That’s absolutely brilliant, I’ll pm you once I’m finished with the discord tonight.
---
Missed it sorry
---
Well, he didn't make some personal attacks in actual replies which were later removed so I guess that counts. 😂
---
Think it's an art decision.  Basically skeletons pre bomb, mummy's post bomb.
---
Everyone in this thread come get me!
---
XBOX IGN: HockeyJones2002
---
It's a day 1 bug, not from the patch. Just exit your power armor or deal with it. 
---
There’s a ton of ways to reduce that damage to nearly nothing if he built for it. Sentinel+assassin armor reduces damage by 75%*40%, Lone wanderer is another 20%, dodgy is 30%ish. If he runs Suppresor he reduces your damage by 30% (unverified if this works on players, just theorycraft here). Dense chest mod+fireproof perk makes you immune to explosive damage. 
---
I think there’s more things that can be stacked. But they all add up a ton. Not saying this is whats going on in your case, but you should be aware of what’s possible. 
---
Thank you captain obvious. 
---
not a single one the whole time, the 3rd time a PA user 100+ saw me she/he got the idea that I needed killin'
---
No worries!;)
---
Who would be dumb enough to pay real money for a fucking legendary?
---
_psssst_.... add Martial Artist.
---
My boyfriend and I were being griefed by someone quite a few levels higher than us at the time, he was trying to take munitions from us.
---
We managed to kill him a few times at which he sends us a message saying he has reported us for hacking. He comes back, we kill him again, get another message saying he has now recorded us hacking and he hopes we enjoy our ban. 
---
At this point it's been going on for about 30 mins so we decide to server hop and let him have munitions. Literally an hour later we get another message from him saying "you know what this game is shit enough without hackers like you ruining it". I dunno how to hack but I guess we should take it as a compliment? XD
---
Weapons I’m not high enough level to use 
---
You would think in a post apocalyptic world ammo would be scarce, yet I have to dump it by the 1000s because I don't use it and can't sell it.
---
I’ll be happy to give you extra ammo I have. I won’t be able to get on till later tonight but if you want it I’ll give it. .38, .308, 10mm and a little .45. 
---
Also, there’s a workshop in the top right corner of the map that produces ammo. 
---
The sky is falling!  Doom and gloom, surely Bethesda will be ruined this time!
---
Look, people can go play another game for 6 months or a year and come back.  There is no monthly fee or subscription, it's just download the client and play.  People can go "find a better blanket" but that doesn't mean they're gone forever.  People still play FO3/FNV to this day, why wouldn't they come back to FO76 if Bethesda addresses their issues?
---
If you're being carried, at least help out. Chuck a grenade. 
---
forgive my ignorance, whats a TSE?
---
Yeah do that as soon as I come across one!   
---
Then realise I don't have enough gunpowder/lead/etc to make enough ::DOH::
---
Wow. Insult me for for saying tons of people have them, which they do... nice dude. Awesome response. I dont use then in PvP unless defending my workshops of you must know, but you say the weapons themselves are toxic... an interesting point from the guy insulting me without provocation. 
---
Agreed. Careful where you shoot hahah
---
Alot of people man. I just looked on Ebay 70 people bought a tse guass rifle for $2. Its fucking insane.
---
Yeah i'm with you.  OP is confusing some anti-tse propoganda with a how-to PvP guide.  He could have maybe mentioned the fact that there's a 3-star perk that just got 45% explosion resistance.  And the padded/dense armor mods.  But instead left people as ignorant as he is about how to actually deal with those people.
---
As someone who doesn't have crazy duped god role legendaries, just what i've looted.  I'd love a good guide on how to rub their TSE shotgun in their faces.  
---
sorry, that is the one perk I *do* have for the gatling.
---
Not intentionally, but happy day anyway.
---
I'm of the opinion that the youtube reviewers that say they hate the game are afraid to admit the game is actually fun at times... if they do they lose subscribers.
---
They're all sheep.
---
Leeches are shitty, lazy, don't contribute a thing, and even make the battle harder. How about you let us play the game by waiting untill you're strong enough to not hide in a shed. 
---
$2 isn't a lot, but at the same time... It kinda is...
---
I'm also a programmer. Their solution in the unpacked update files was adding a flag to the hardened masses to skip auto scrapping similar to other items that already had that behavior. It's pretty easy to apply this flag to all mods, though I'm sure it's a bit more complicated than just adding it to one item. Still, maybe a day for one person, probably much less. 
---
I'm still happy with where the game is, but the progress on fixing the lingering issues is slow. No need to go on the defensive for a massive corporation.
---
Whoever is tanking her, bring her to the shed ;). 
---
Yeah why keep them? You’ll find them again lol 
---
with the perks equipped that should be the damage output..if u take one away u will notice a the output is lower
---
Yes it's good. Two shot Gatling was my main before I got tse. With all the perks it could kill scorchedbeasts before they took off, from there spawn.
---
No, the only proof was a shitty Photoshop hack job from a single user
---
&gt; Making a post about it on Reddit isn’t going to help much.
---
That's where you're wrong friend. Posting it on reddit is a much better way than submitting a ticket. The more it gets known - the more they have to rush to fix it
---
Nah, I have a pspro, this is the only game that blue screens. Its a known issue with this game. In fact every time I form a group in a nuke zone at least 1 or two of them blue screen and have to come back in by the time the nuke is over. There are some stability patches in this patch tomorrow for us so hopefully that helps to resolve some of them.
---
Coal
---
Yeah especially for a digital gun you can buy on subreddit for 5k caps which you can earn for free
---
It's really random. Two days ago we had to kill the SQB with 3ppl because the server was pretty empty.
---
 You can check your server population on the secial menu before a nuke launch.
---
What an absolute Fucking asshole.
---
Get a life instead of posting my username in order for me to get hate. 
---
Nope. Known issue.
---
This guy already made 140 on just one listing
---
same, i will know tomorrow (xbox) , but pc gamers should already know ?
---
you will realize which ammo u like to use..and then u will have to determine where to farm that ammo
---
Fuck... I could use some money...
---
Thats my username
---
I got the Hot Rodder paints and, same as you, I don't use them. T-45 looks the best, but I can't bring myself to use it because, it's T-45.
---
If your on xbox, I'm happy to make ammo if you chip in some supplies for it.  
---
You'd be surprised my dude
---
wait, does the gatling gun run off rifleman perks?
---
because I literally have *no heavy weapon perk cards*
---
Every comment I see like yours hurts because you so clearly have no idea how duping even works in the slightest. 
---
Scarlet Crusade, anyone? XD
---
Hardly matters, it goes live, like, tomorrow. 
---
He's being sarcastic Dr Valen
---
gimmie a plan for a power armor station and I'll love you back
---
I have heard the same, but interesting:)
---
Locked doors don't help against server crashes. You should never drop anything you don't want possibly disappearing into the void.
---
Glitch.
---
Don't Bethesda is gonna crack down hard on these guys. Its illegal to sell these items for irl money.
---
yeah how do you do it
---
doesn't it look funny the way the scorched hold miniguns?
---
This is a lie; I get ammo on literally ever single kill as long as the enemy was shooting a weapon to begin with. This may just be an issue on console if that is what you are using because PC is absolutely working as intended.
---
I didn't realize Perfect Storm was a TSE weapon... But you're also the idiot that forgets that VATS give melee the ability to just teleport a distance for a 100% chance to hit.
---
So ranged vs. melee is a battle of futility. You can't keep your distance and deal damage with ranged as melee can always move as fast or faster than you.
---
You've obviously never fought a melee build while you were using a ranged weapon that didn't just one-shot or quickly kill them before. Why do you think melee quit being the go-to for PvP exactly?
---
fucking thing can fire for ever and ever too, it's kinda insane.
---
I have like 5k 5mm ammo rounds, and it weighs like ... 5 lbs.  It's insanely efficient.
---
LOL what an idiot.
---
You sure he is? I've seen some insane levels of stupid
---
Found my plans last night at the vendor in Grafton, not the train station.
---
Iuno but fwiw the queen has been more squishy recently. I don't think everything people are seeing is just bobbleheads.
---
Lol I thought this was funny too. Due to the new park change, if anything, I look for specifically for players still using explosive for pvp. They don't do a thing to me now. 
---
Pretty neat brother. I like it!
---
I think that effectively makes the Gatling "broken" and far stronger than it's supposed to be.
---
Other random facts about the weirdness of the Gatling: You'll unlock the pistol kills atom challenge with it. The gunner's sight leans 45 degrees for no reason. If you enter 3rd person mode you'll get a HUD "cross hair" (dot) you can aim with and it's surprisingly accurate.
---
I can confirm also that this is correct. I've never had a mod scrapped when doing scrap all, but if I go to my stash and store all junk, it will put the mods in there with it.
---
Strange, that happens to be my username as well. What a coincidence. Strange, as I believe that Xbox does not allow 2 accounts with the same username
---
it has a button ? never noticed that, made a switch when i installed it :)
---
nah there's just not a lot of people playing this game
---
If you've ever worked with emotionally unstable people in real life, you'll realize a lot of people will cast blame on anybody but themselves. They think you're griefing them, when in reality they were griefing. They think you cheated or hacked because you won (either by cleverness or brute force). They did no wrong -- you always did.
---
You're right, but at the same time, I really want to be able to but some chinese food on my own... Keith only gets it like once in awhile and I need more orange chicken, rice, and noodles in my life.
---
It was a mutated crawler, which I hadn't seen before, was high level, and fun to fight. I just wanted to quickly share before I went to bed, in case people were interested, but the late hour meant I didn't use a taxonomically correct term.
---
I'm sorry, it was really just sharing something exciting. I didn't mean to sounds disingenuous or clickbaity
---
I realized that. I guess I’ll have to try myself
---
it increases. 
---
I don't know what else to say other than you complete and utter losers
---
I am in the US and suffered multiple controls not responding and server disconnects after the last patch, hoping this got fix makes it better.
---
Via a glitch.
---
I'm not on pc I'm on ps4
---
It feels like it did nothing as far as damage. Maybe it was a wording change to avoid confusion. 
---
The bottom floor of my base is open because it's gonna be a selling post/rest/cooking stop. The rest is locked because it's "reserved" for my team. My base ("The Overlook") is our East map hub/HQ.
---
how do you do the glitch
---
That's not a sign. That's an overly expensive space taker uper. No deal.
---
Dead man sprinting
---
No regrets yet, but I bought the Northern Lights T51 Power Armor and then the Slay Bells skin for the death tambo. Love them both.
---
Hell I'm a college student man I know what being broke as hell is like but I ain't risking my neck
---
Better value for the money than paying $18 at the ATOM store for a paint job. 
---
Step 1. Get the mask
---
Step 2. ???
---
Step 3. Profit
---
I certainly think it's powerful, just not TSE level "broken" powerful.
---
There's also a luggage bag next to the golf cart by the club house and in the side strip of houses on the second floor there is a pharmacy kit thing laying on a bed. People often dump items in both of those as well.
---
what's step 2
---
How much money would people take for my organs?
---
Will do, thanks. 
---
"???"
---
Yeah when you power it up there's a red light that will show up on one of the sides, that's actually the button to turn it on (or was in 4)
---
#SO #YOU'RE #THE #ONE!
---
j/k.
---
Yeah I haven't had any issues with disconnects or crashes, unlike a lot of other ppl apparently...just adds to the weirdness 
---
It could work like 50% and then add 50% to that which would be 75% because 50% of 50% is 25%. It's not always obvious how stuff adds up, and some things would be game breaking if they did add up in a certain way. Like in some games you could effectively get 100% damage reduction making you unkillable. That is slightly overpowered.
---
I believe the lever gun plan is level locked like a lot of the weapon plans unfortunately.  I found my plan back at level 30 in grafton station.  I've never seen any random world spawn locations, and there was only a very small window of time (levle 20-40) where I saw them dropping as loot and even then very very rarely.
---
Alot Google it I think a bad of blood goes for a few hundred dollars
---
I hear Red Dead’s reeeeaallll pleasant
---
not sure bruh never used that gun
---
Can confirm.  I took my level 15 alt over to Harper's Ferry and got the Handmade Plans on the first try.  648 caps well spent!
---
Yep, scrap bats. It's not super rare. Just farm lots of scorched.
---
The workshop closest to vault 76
---
Black water mine
---
Can I regenerate blood?
---
Cheers man, I'm on ps4 so not sure there's much I can do. I've only got 76 installed on there atm and I delete anything from the storage that's not needed anymore
---
Unfortunately if the prime receiver was put onto a legendary 50 cal, we would have to sacrifice the unique effects by crafting a new one. 
---
The best trap is a massive text wall
---
Xbone... should I cross link to r/crappyofbrands?
---
Every night.   I have coaching tonight but I'll be on later
---
So the answer is no then...?
---
There's a whole bunch of shoulda woulda coulda we could talk about Bethesda for days on end. Some of them have even been addressed e.g. PoV sliders, PTT. Plenty of them have not been address and some look like they will be soon. 
---
Give it time. They're on it. They're not super fast but at least it seems to be moving along if the past month or so of patches are anything to go by.
---
I immediately broke out my dusty gauss rifle.  Rifleman perks for sure increase it's damage now.  I have no idea how it used to be lol.. 
---
Is that the paint that comes with the prototype x01 plans?
---
Ok so if I built a base early on, how do i access the increased budget? Mine hasn't changed as i leveled but i still use same base.
---
I played a melee build until I had enough ammo to switch to rifle/shotgun 
---
If they have a window just peek through and sit on a chair or use a workstation, that is what I do
---
Fyi this aint it chief. I know players on all consoles selling them for around 300 to 500 caps. That price is ridiculous 
---
Unless there is an official word from Bethesda okaying certain mods,  I'd avoid all mods
---
Just take the pieces out of the chassis and trade them lolol
---
ahh..
---
Nice to know, thanks :)
---
Fuck yeah... With an infinite supply of money I can get all the ChinaMax I want...
---
If you get bored later try it with all the Heavy Gunner perks + Stabilized + One Gun Army.
---
What's a scorchbeast? You mean these skidmarks here? _That_ was a scorchbeast? Don't forget to laugh in 5mm.
---
Maybe to keep it off the front page?
---
Start taking these glitch abusers seriously Bethesda and start permanently banning each and every one of them. They will not stop abusing and finding new methods to break your game until you remove them from your game like a parent has to scold a spoiled and rude child. They have no care for the community, no care for your rules and no care for their actions unless you take the care of removing them and punishing them for it. This will not end at the next fix, or the one after that and so forth until they are banned and removed from your game and community. Let Youtubers fume all they want because the real players who care about your game and the amazing community that resides here will support you!
---
-karma
---
I tend to randomly invite people to team especially if I have a workshop. 
---
One, if I get kicked from the server I can get back in without losing my work. 
---
and 
---
Two, if I’m done playing the workshop goes to a team member free of charge. 
---
Or I need to fast travel and don’t want to spend the caps....
---
You can blame hoarders like me for picking it all up on pc.
---
I like what your selling. But I don’t like your price
---
As soon as they are removed from PvP? That's never happening. 
---
speaking of the whitespring nuke zone i was in one last night and it was so boring that i logged out..at first i was the only person there..then there were no glowing ones anywhere..seemed completely different so i just logged off
---
Server hop Grafton Vendor until he sells you the plan. If i remember correctly it has a weird name like "Lever Gun Plan" or something like that.
---
ah hope that's not the case, side note only place i know to get the actual guns as loot is scorchbeasts found 3/5 that i've scrapped over time at them, luckily i have a l45 i just particularly want the plans for scrapping (got a fair pile of screws and springs and not much to usem on beyond repairs + upgrades\_
---
I seen the Black Cowboy Hat on that google doc. In the Whitespring's Golf Club, their is a body slumped over in a wheelchair that has a cowboy hat on you can take.
---
Not yet prolly wit the dlc.  More BOS paint in game juss not unlock able yet
---
Are you on pc?
---
An ordinary combat shotgun with the shotgun perks are all you need. 1 SB = 12 rds of shotgun shells. Makes you feel like a badass too.
---
Your assuming they only have one copy of the game. The one I've talked to seem to indicate he has multiples D/L or disk. I've wondered for most of my F76 time why duping and trading is a big deal; that is till I talked to this duper now it makes more sense to me now. Theirs real world money involved and no I haven't purchased in-game assets with real world money.
---
I have about 500 suggestions to make this game better before I hit "Ban the dupers."  It's right below "Show the mongrel genitals for immersion's sake."
---
Farm the deathclaws at the nuclear waste disposal site. :)
---
If he didn't change the picture, he could have gotten away with it. It's not an absurd thing to maybe have that much ammo. But changing the picture blew his cover
---
I saw a significant quantity of ammo last night in one of the inside suitcases in a Train Station. It was appreciated, and I left my extra plans in trade for the next person.
---
I also would like to know, keep seeing these ultra detailed stores and mansions and my little shack is full
---
Lol jesus.
---
So this games stability is fine today because next month it'll beer patched more?
---
That's some wonky logic man
---
They probably did expect something like that.  Something more community-driven, with players grouping together to hold a workshop and keep it running while others try to raid it.  Resulting in these long, epic battles with power armors jetting around and lasers flying everywhere, maybe with someone nuking the workshop to end it all.
---
It's just not turning out that way.  It doesn't seem particular beneficial to hold onto a workshop except for roleplay purposes.  And to the extent anyone is interested in competitive, balanced PVP, those people seem to be in the minority.  PVE seems the preferred mode of play, and most PVP (that I've seen anyway, and have read about) seems pretty one-sided and griefy.
---
Also a bit weird how you're thrust into PVP at level 5, when you barely have any SPECIAL upgrades or perks equipped.  Kinda surprised that doesn't happen much higher, at maybe 25.  Or even 50, despite the time it'd take to hit that (though it's not that bad, really), so everyone at least has all their SPECIAL points and a decent selection of perk cards.
---
I also like to announce I am dropping a ton of unwanted legendary gear then everyone runs over and starts giving heart emotes and racing to get into the bag. I find this more entertaining as the person dropping it then putting it in suitcases and such. I usually just do the suitcase thing if no one else is around and I need to dump them all or I'm leaving the area. Also, its really fun to mess with people sometimes when there's a crowd trying to get into the bag and keep dropping 1 ammo somewhere else so the bag moves over and over lol, just if you are looking for a laugh. They will chase you around like a puppy dog and a tennis ball.
---
i am a lv110 and never seen any kind of paint job anywhere other in the Atom shop and  tricentennial .
---
What quest is that ? :)
---
I just picked up one from the vendor at Sutton Station, never seen it before (my camp is nearby) so I snapped it up!
---
Found the plans, thanks folks for recommending grafton went right into bot greg and smack dab 3rd recipe down!
---
Same here.  I have so many mats, I don't even bother locking the extractor anymore.
---
Yeah my trust Hatchet (which I've named "Rick"..) works wonders at the moment 
---
Yet that's how the game is designed. Hate on me all you want, but it's much smarter to loot the boiled water as you go, grabbing however many you need to craft soup or drinks than waste time crafting it at home. 
---
Plus you're accruing like it's some big deal grabbing the boiled water. Count how many toy walk past next time you play. Come back here and complain some more. Shit is literally right there every time. What the hell is the problem? 
---
May I ask what map app is that? Thanks!
---
No word of a lie we had a level 4 dude join ours the other night and contribute nothing. Just ran around trying to stay alive. 
---
I'm all for helping the new guys, infact I quite enjoy it. But that's a joke.
---
My budget has not gone up from when I built my base at lvl 22 to 50+.  Unless I am bugged, I do not think it increases.
---
Ah yes, i'm on PC and post-patch i checked it.  Rifleman perks work with it for sure.
---
It doesn't. There was speculation it would at beta, but as of now either hasn't been implemented or is flat out busted. You will not get more space as you level up.
---
During the beta I found about 8 behemoths in the same spot
---
I often dump my unneeded ammo in containers from the vault to the overseer camp.  Others do as well.. so it's worth looking around there when you are low. 
---
Making your ammo it the best bet,  tho. 
---
Its keeps the armor on it so it saves space when storing armor
---
Just remove the 2 shot explosive thing from the game
---
I'm not trying to argue tip 1 isn't good advice, I'm just saying I don't think it's practical advice. You can't even tell if someone's gun is explosive or not until they shoot it, generally at you. And in my experience, most of the people online that go around looking for fights have explosive weapons.
---
I love PvP, but have not bothered trying on this game past my first few experiences. Now that they've changed Fireproof, I might be willing to give it a shot.
---
I find your assertion that I abuse explosive weapons in PvP really funny, as outside of one instance where me and another player killed each other simultaneously with explosive guns at a workshop I was defending (in one shot, which is the exact situation that made me not bother trying past that), I have never fired an explosive weapon at a player. Nor will I. Because they're dumb.
---
wow thanks for clearing the perk side of things up! You're response if far more helpful than some other dingo's that thought it was good enough to simply state that they exist.....   
---
Oooh your point about melee is interesting! But I don't agree totally. The reason two shots and eplosive rounds were such a problem is because they had no weaknesses. A baby could use them to completely own several other very strong players. This is why in my opinion, anyone who uses them in PvP is clearly proving that they suck and have no skill or style. Especially when they use them to ruin and own players that clearly don't have them. Tards. 
---
Now, melee is great (it's fine for it to be very powerful) because it will always have one huge and obvious weakness: You have no range at all. As soon as you see someone is relying on their melee build, you can run like the wind, keep your distance and have a good chance at controlling the fight.  
---
Some of my favourite, most enjoyable pvp battles have been against players that have one-hit melee builds. As long as a weapon / play style has a big weakness, it's never going to be a major issue. 
---
No it does not
---
It does the same thing when walking
---
Wow, a copy paste response. Lol. 
---
Thats cool. I havent seen it for less than my price. I will budge on the Rifle but definitely not the shotgun.
---
Yah, even without duped gear it just doesn't seem particularly competitive.  Blasting some low-level player's camp to the ground barely qualifies as gameplay, s'not very sportsmanlike, and their only recourse is to change locations and hope to be left alone or server-hop.  Eh~
---
Shotgun price aint changing.
---
I agree, much lower than that and they can't even contribute by killing the scorched adds. The only thing they accomplish is buffing the queen.
---
Ooh yeah , forgot about that trick  
---
Might be worth keeping them then!
---
That price is fair 
---
Reproducing high-quality goods in the cheapest manner possible to sell for a profit sounds more like capitalism.
---
Ah.. well dang. But thanks for the info!
---
Just saying there's all types of people. So yeah I'm sure there are people that dupe stuff just for themselves like ammo/food/drugs/mats.
---
For.... reasons?
---
Well. You can pack snacks for a trip. But I like the premise. Some people get motion sick traveling? I’d be interested to see how a disease that nerfs SPECIAL based off how far and often you travel would play out.  
---
Zactly
---
Ionno man. I just like killing people and stealing their stuff. 
---
Sometimes you wreck, sometimes you get wrecked. I’ve tried fucking with a level 40 at one point and he blew me away with a TSE. All I could do was laugh. 
---
Some of us don’t do it with the sole intent of being a douche, and even if we do, it pays to be a good sport if we get merc’d. It’s Raider Life man. 
---
You can move it to a flash drive, it upload to youtube or Facebook. There's also an onboard trim tool.
---
I wasnt tryin to sound like a dick. Great stats on them though. 
---
Somebody tested it on the Reddit discord and dense + fireproof was something like a 90% reduction in explosive damage.
---
Fellow resto druid here! I also have stayed away from the SBQ because I thought I would just get in the way, now am interested to see if I can help handle adds and support.
---
Nice!
---
People can't believe some just want to play their one character forever...
---
Well, it wasn't just that. He kept changing his story. If he just came in here and not said anything about duping and not argued with people that claimed he was duping it probably would have been okay. His original post said not duped and duper's won't get it. He was protesting it too much. And he's done this several times before.
---
irony is that I bought it from a vendor for like 300 caps or something
---
Every deathclaw should give 5-8 ore from personal experience, mole miners sometimes drop scrap which contains it - just server hop deathclaw island if you can kill them
---
Not just TSE guns anymore. Also got some sentinel gear for sale. Plus cutting out the only 2 decent gun legendaries would make Legendaries completely unviable at all. 
---
But they were like that all the time. New factions have issues - yeah, Enclave has issues since before the war, remember that it's the legacy of Fallout universes USA government and other top schmucks, and it is filled with almost exclusively psychopaths.
---
I'm not even sure a wipe can save the economy since we don't know for sure if Bethesda can fully patch duping.
---
Sounds like you're defending a duper.
---
Dupers ruin not only the virtual economy, but the servers as well. 
---
They're already known to crash/lag servers to unplayable levels. This is not fun.
---
It's as much as Bethesda's fault as the dupers... but whereas Bethesda is untouchable, we can kill dupers and relieve them of their goods.
---
I guess I was wonder the reason why you made that distinction but if you don’t want to explain I respect that 
---
Mmhmm. I really like power patcher for that reason.
---
I ended up making a build specifically for the Gatling.
---
I love this weapon. 
---
i always have 4, one for my Ultracite, one for X-01, one for excavator and one empty chassis to use for storing body parts while swapping around...
---
by that i mean, i have 1 jetpack torso and one stealhboy torso for the X-01, so i stor the one not in use on a empty chassis  :)
---
You may need the prior two recipes to craft shielded.  Protective and Reinforced or what-have-you. If you don't already!
---
The xbone nigga
---
Grafton or Welch.  
---
I get that but it doesn’t mean people can’t have fun
---
Is it low level? 
---
Rifleman worked on it before as well...
---
There has to have been bread crumbs left prior to the fact.
---
Or you could be the kind of person that doesn't add to the hate? I'm just playing devil's advocate here 
---
I didnt think you were being a dick, lol. I just havent seen them for anything less than 5k, explosive anything. I saw someone selling an explosive 10mm for 20k....that i will agree is too much.
---
unfortunaly not , there was a big area where the bomb was.
---
These might be random spawns , if i find another one i'll take a screen shot on the map of where it is 
---
Yup.
---
Now go fuck off you good for nothing piece of shit
---
I've noticed this on 3 occasions, once when high level when it spawned 30+ super mutants all right there during the enclave bot stop quest. Then twice just with liberators at the train station, tons of fun i hope they don't fix it.  
---
As I've stated previously Mr. Reading Comp, I have enough experience playing Fallout 4 (so mechanically similar to 76 the same bugs and exploits bled through) and GTAO (the money-printing machine whose dragon Bethesda was clearly trying to chase) that I have a good idea what I'm dealing with without actually dealing with it. That is an educated opinion. 
---
By all means though, keep screwing up the doublethink in your tiny little head up enough to justify mashing the report button because you don't like my opinions.
---
We can dream cant we lol 
---
Why do you think (from a game developers perspective) the removal of these OP, duped, game-crushing guns is such a crazy idea? If it was your game, why do you think it's so important to keep them?  
---
More than likely turrets. They take up a lot of budget (and barely do anything).
---
Best advice for a heavy gun build is to realize it will suck until your heavily invested in it perk wise. Know that HG's are not the top-tier DPS. For non-explosive HG's Stabalized, One Gun Army, Gunsmith, Ammosmith and Bear Arms are must-have perks.
---
 Expect to being fixing guns and making more ammo constantly. Gatling gun and .50 cal are your best guns. Minigun and Plasma Gatling break to much. Laser Gatling does no damage and breaks too much. LMG is the fastest way to waste ammo and is got for nothing else. Harpoon Gun is a sniper rifle for HG users.
---
For explosive HG's know AGL and M79 don't work with Bear Arms, and Ordnance Express is a must have. Know the Broadsider is an explosive HG. AGL will probly be your everyday gun, Keep a Fatman for landed Scorchbeasts and crowds. Be smart enough to not blow yourself up too often. Know that the Heavy Gunner perks have no effect on explosive HG's.
---
I personally am a 2h melee first, Explosive HG's 2nd build. 
---
Nah I just got 14 of them
---
Idk i havent checked nikes website in a while im more into adidas
---
I don't know what the percentage is, but I know it's less than 20 springs to repair a leg. Combined with fix it good I don't worry much about springs 
---
Thats really nice of you! But alas, im a filthy casual on PS4. 
---
Quick side note, this community is awesome, cross platform. Last night a guy just GAVE me an extra marsupial serum. Now to figure out how to pay it forward... maybe leave a bunch of legendary weapons I don't want (or aren't worth the fast travel to sell) outside of vault 76?
---
Fort Defiance straitjackets sell for up to 50 caps if you have high charisma, hard bargain and Grape Mentats.
---
I’m the same way. I’ve run lower level groups though the queen, call it testing my build. One benefit of low levels is whoever procs the queen, that is the base health, the more players more health.
---
I’ve tested the level thing pretty throughly. It’s the difference between a 2-5 minutes queen (low level proc) and a 10-20 queen( high level proc)

The old style of duping never got fixed though so it's definitely still possible

The game seems unplayable in its current state
---
Well aren't you the righteous knight gallivanting over the wasteland. Typically a hero of your caliber would have minstrels to sing praise of your deeds, perhaps yours was lost during one of your campaigns? None the less, tales of your chivalry have rung far and true. Blessed are we to have such a savior in our midst, surely we are not worthy.
---
I believe the key phrase is " just do it", but not sure on the code itself. 
---
Lol 
---
Yeah I’m hoping it gets adjusted down the line, some weapons are effectively useless because of how the ammunition economy in the game is set up. I just want to use my flamer and LMG. 
---
No, that's a joke, i'm not the OP
---
From a developers stand point... why spend the money and resources to rewrite code to remove legitimate weapons from PvP. It isn't like they are hacked weapons, they drop legit in game.
---
Spreading that Goblin Love. ❤️

You such a liar, you loot regardless if it is locked or not, that's just who you are.

That would be pricelesss if she was first npc added.  To be later followed by Preston spamming workshop/camp NEEDS OUR HELP.

Are you an idiot? I ask this because you don’t seem to understand, part of rushing to get to level 50 is to save all the quests until you’re max level for the sweet named legendaries.

To be fair, items weren't showing up in people's inventories after trading, but would then reappear after a relog. So that got some people

Then there was the accidentally setting it's price at 0 that got others.

It was more miscommunication than it was just a "myth". Things were actually happening, just not the way they thought they were

Did you go to the top level open lounge / bar in the garrahan estate? There's usually a legendary there and I'm interested in whether anything changes. Thanks

It’s a meme

The challenge is just a good way to record total game time. I highly doubt they expect anyone to reach those hours. No reason to get upset really

Just like in real life!

Yep, I think it's the best one so far. And it's for T-60 only )
---
Yeah I am in ps4 and took them all off and back on again and their is a change. So, I really don’t know.
---
Hey youve done an entire section of the mainquest then xD
---
Don't budge, it's the classic "It's not worth anything, so give it to me" line that is common in MMOs.
---
Yup, I had this happen back when I was farming mutations. The game treats it as if you have the mutation only you won’t receive any of its effects. Only way I was able to correct it was to use radaway to remove the bugged mutations. 
---
You just connect a wire to it like any other generator.
---
No it doesn't 
---
I'm convinced that the industrial purifiers are bugged somehow. I seem to get more water with 3-4 small purifiers than 2x Industrial

then you don't have to buy.

Herbivore or carnivore mutation?

Feels like it should be doing more damage then. But oh well, it's still really powerful

Oh my god I never thought of the bunny ears! Genius!!

its a joke dude

Just south of Whitesprings on a junk node. Very close to two vendors and pretty central in the map. I don't run any defense and every once in a while, I find my power generator is broken. NBD. Very rare to find someone in the spot too.
---
Yeah, that one's tough on us cannibals
---
Oof.
---
If you're on PS4, I can craft marine under armor for you. I can also give you Brotherhood Fatigues (moddable just like the plugsuit) if you want to try on those, again, if you haven't tried already.
---
well when the duping method involves crashing the server, it makes a lot of sense that crashing servers would be their fault......
---
Re-reading it knowing rifleman apparently already worked, i'm thinking maybe it's related to like the tank-killer perk or that one in luck for cripple chance?
---
I once gained speed demon from eating a roasted mega sloth. I guess that one at least makes a bit more sense
---
I'm not sure either. I'm on xbox and the perks always increased damage 
---
I don’t believe so. I did recently get irradiated af, but it didn’t tell me about any mutations. Would it be under STAT/effects? Cuz if so, then nope, no mutations.
---
You mean while the one shot you with there TSE

Doesn't work :(

then console players wouldn't have this issue?

You might be able to find the plans on the Reddit FO76 marketplace, or xbox LFG section... not sure if PS4 has an equivalent.

There's somemore veins beside the Whietsprings entrance/gate below (downhill and South of) the Bunker.

He doesn't know how to use the three seashells.

I have found that doing that or leaving them in a container at the Overseer's camp, to be effective.

I’m hoping at the very least it will no longer be classified as an energy weapon... good luck on jay though lol.
---
It is a bug. It is supposed to be 76 atoms.
---
Id rather it be unviable then shitheads making money off of this shit
---
If you die to radiation right after getting the mutation, it will be glitched and you cannot get it.  Even taking a serum will not work.
---
The short-term workaround is you can unequip starched genes and clear ALL your mutations with radaway or a decon shower, and start over.
---
Again, sry man I know this is a hassle.
---
Nah I use em when I need em. Why not? 
---
This game has taught me to not hoard lol.
---
Don’t let your dreams be dreams.

Do you have starched genes on?

I mean you could stockpile till economy returns to normal and duper’s have been pounded to make a healthy profit

(Somehow I forgot the first line, even though I had a glitched Mr Messenger sing it about 50 times while I looted the house he took me to. "Happy Anniversary da da da da da da...")
---
I got you but servers keep crashing for me 
---
Think of them as either a collectible, or a power boost of strength to overcome enemies. Use it or lose it basically. 
---
This is awesome and it makes me realize my budget must be bugged.
---
Makes sense! 
---
Should hurry, the codes will reset in a little over an hour.

Oh I was just confused because it doesn’t say what it requires. Just a normal power generator?

Solo, 20ish.  Drug it to a SAM site and let it do most of the chewing.  Mid 30's without support.

That looks amazing, I would love to see a lot of these custom paint jobs for power armour.

The bug's age is real. Been a thing since Fo4 faaaah haaaba (which added the lever gun).

I honestly think it was one of those problems that kept getting pushed off to deal with more serious problems... you know, like duping.

I carry x4 sets of PA with me all the time, only one has an Atom paint on it, and the symbol is always there.

Starch genes unequipped, but it seems I'm not the only one with the issue per some of the other comments.

They only bloom while the Quest Heart of the Swamp is active.

That’s an easy fix, when they start trying to kill the ghouls to screw you, you step in front of their shot. I just did it to one 😁 not difficult

That was what I was thinking. I never have enough 10mm ammo

If you scroll over it in build mode it should show you it produces 100 power.

4. This is a last ditch effort. I have been running this game without issue since the first day of the BETA. About a month ago I deleted and reinstalled my bootcamp to add more space and the issue above started. The game runs fine now, this is purely a texture issue that seems to be effecting non-permanent objects that would have a sheen to them and my character as well as Super Mutant and Ghouls faces giving them a white/chrome texture. I have deleted and reinstalled the game over 10 times, run the scan and repair as many times, completely deleted and reinstalled boot camp again, run the game on low, medium, high and ultra, tried to adjust within AMD control center, attempted to adjust within the INI preferences and the issue remains.   
---
Again, the game has had no issue prior to this and I was able to run it without issue until just before the patch before the recent one. I understand my processor is slow but I know players with even lesser processors who run the game without this visual glitch. I hope I can get help figuring this out as I love the game and the glitch is a major distraction when playing. Thank you.

As far as I know we haven't found a clear trigger for what spawns these. Some people say they spawn during the "Heart of the Swamp" event, although my own testing found this to not be the case. Others have speculated that it has something to do with flushing the damn (via a terminal) above the chemical plant. I personally have found blooms there only at night; I found them twice, both times at night, and got enough bloom that I haven't needed to go back for more testing. As far as I'm aware it was never bugged. 
---
So innocent...
---
No way.. Some stack.. Plus why not have a boost if you can get one.. I run a bobble head n mag shop bc I like to collect them most &amp; why not help others in the process.
---
Did your glitched mutations show up in your listing?  Mine don't show.  I'm scared I'll wipe out all my non-bugged ones without removing the "unlisted &amp; inactive" ones.
---
Cap max is 25k, and you can get that many caps easier than any TSE weapon. Currently, caps are considered worthless in the trade community due to the ease you can get them, so if someone is selling a TSE weapon, any price in caps is fair.

If you’re on pc and want it I can paint it for you for free. I haven’t been on in a week though so I’m not sure if I’ll have to update

---
You had to sort of mental role play a bit to feel impactful at the end of 4. Personally I LOVED it, but I did it a certain way that I don't think many did on a first play through.
---
I was big on settlements. Had pretty much every settlement available fleshed out. The minutemen had patrols, towns, and people all over the map with trade caravans, etc. Story wise my character wasn't a fan of the BoS demanding taxes from the destitute nearby farms. This interfered directly with my goals, and the synth final solution stuff didn't sit well. I helped them to a degree until Danse revealed himself. At this point I was done with Maxson. When I parted ways, it was clear they were disappointed, but didn't swear me off as an enemy. I did all the Railroad stuff. I found my son in the Institute, and forgot myself for a few quests, trying to find the good in the organization to find the good in him. I learned he was not perfect and held views that could be dangerous. He'd lived his life without me, longer than I'd lived. His final days were spent wondering what could've been, releasing me, building a child Shaun. He clearly loved me and longed for what might've been different had he had his father, to watch from a distance how I might react and what I'd do to find him. He was scared of dying, and wanted his dad. For that I couldn't fault him, but I couldn't accept what he had come to represent at the top of the Institute. Even if I joined and took over, my position would be ceremonial at best. The Institue was about to lose its leadership, and showed no signs of being able to re-orient itself. I left, and he was hurt, but in his goodbye you could tell he understood, at least how you came to your conclusions.
---
I got to the point where they're asking you to build the teleporter. After hearing their plans to try to save "all" of the synths, and knowing their strength was too small to cope with the Brotherhood after dealing with the Institute, I told them that they're all cool, but I'm going to be doing this with my Minutemen. They say they understand, and implore me to try my best to save as many as possible should shit go down. Already was the plan, cool, see ya later. So I go on out and build the teleporter, with all Minutemen quests completed implying you've overcome the previous faults of the Minutemen, failed leadership and organization. The *people* of the Commonwealth, the ones terrorized by the Institute, are the ones who fall in line behind me to destroy it, while simultaneously attempting to save everyone they could, whether they had personal reservations or not. It was sick as fuck rolling in leading the charge with crank rifles pelting everything from behind me. 
---
Your son is on his deathbed. You have a touching moment, and a bittersweet goodbye as you both remember what could've been.
---
As a final gift he gives you what you always wanted in his child self synth, to be able to be a father and live the life with him he always wanted. Sturges asks you whether you're ok with it as its a little uncanny. While not my son, this synth was mapped by my sons brain, and is in all ways a child. I brought him with me.
---
Game ends. Credits roll. Here's why I think it wrapped up really well. 
---
The Institute is destroyed. 
---
The Railroad is still in operation, helping synths from the Institute find a life. Not all synths were saved, but those were Gen 2's and such, simpler beings though mildly sentient. Sucks, but in the Wasteland, a Gen 3 is the only type I'd imagine could thrive. 
---
The Brotherhood maintains the Prydwyn, but does not have a hold on the Commonwealth. At every settlement, the Minutemen stand guard. The Brotherhood haven't left, but they are a bit upset that it was the Minutemen, not the Brotherhood took out the Institute. You'll see this when you find their continued walking patrols (I've got Minutemen AND BoS troops on patrol). They say it should've been them. Beyond being disgruntled, they leave you be. Typically in the story, if you choose similar choices and go with the Minutemen, the BoS will actually attack the Castle, forcing you to blow it up similarly to the Railroad quest. Have enough settlements however, and the BoS will never attack, no matter how many times you Visit the Castle. If you have clear control of the Commonwealth, they acknowledge your superiority and continue to stay neutral. If they stay, they follow my rules. Without establishing roots, I imagine the Prydwyn will move on, or they will have to start working with me.
---
The Minutemen are essentially a full sized army that controls, patrols, and lives in the Commonwealth. Everyday dirty folk have found a cause to get behind, a movement of the people that provides safety and comfort. The *hearts* and *minds* of the Commonwealth have found hope. Hope is what a desolate post apocalypse is always about. Other endings leave a question mark on the fate of everything. I feel like a diplomatic Minuteman win gives the land the best chance to continue thriving.
---
My character would eventually go to Nuka World, seeing what this raiding business is about, then laughing in their face and slaughtering them all when they said it was time to start invading the Commonwealth, YOUR settlements. You can basically say, uhhh, bro those are literally all mine. They think ohhh all the better and easier? Yeah bud, enjoyed goofing around with you psychos, time to pop heads.

Far Harbor was just plain cool. Nicks story is nearly just as cool as the main one. Just love the whole feel and struggle of the DLC.
---
What? Evidence? On the internet?
---
You sir, are a mad man.
---
Belching Bertha mine
---
Completely unnecessary, leave pacifist on. When you don’t accept their challenge they usually try to kill all the adds. You just step in front of them and they kill themselves. Anyone else I hammer
---
95s
---
just sell them to vendor bots
---
(most) people buying bobbleheads (esp explosive ones) are dupers
---
That’s the problem with these people attacking and destroying camps. When people like you or myself friend request to fast travel and actually help the team with the game, others will be suspicious of our intentions. 
---
I have never initiated PvP because it’s fallout and it does not help. 
---
I have found other player camps and all I have ever done is sleep in the bed and use the stash box. 
---
only used them for the challenge then in the early weeks i used to sell them for caps
---
now i barely even find any but ill just use them if i find them since they arent worth10 caps for 1 weight
---
Same here. But I also have a nice acid node too. 
---
Cheap fast travel to Watoga area as well. 
---
Gonkraider comment appears by his choice of wording appears to be sarcastic. Insane stupid its a thing
---
Yeah you could be right, maybe it was a clan that was in my group that i didn't notice and he was targeting the wrong person. He said he reported me but nothing ever came of it of course.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  I'll probably do it, since I'm a rifle build, I really need that 25% critical boost.
---
Supersledge...lol. Adorable! You wouldn't get close enough before being one-shot sniped from the roof with a TSE Gauss.
---
I'm not angry, just think it's cute.
---
Youtube game reviewers love the sound of their own voices.
---
(Oil) Slick skin paint for armor. Only works for metal limbs (iirc) really was hoping to apply it to all- no matter how strewn together my pieces are 
---
Best one in the game. Provides 100 power and not as bulky as the others. But, if you store it or move, you won't be able to place it back down until you learn the plans. 
---
Freelance PA heavy gunner here btw, potential caravan guard?
---
Yeah thats what it produces though thats different. So I need like 20 generators?
---
I bought the plans from the vendor at Camden Park at level 100 something the other day. I always check the plans and it was the first time I ever noticed it and I go to that vendor multiple times a day, so, uh, rare.
---
Precisely, not only do they "find" TSE weapons, they can even afford to sell or gift them to others. Some streamer-girl was trying to convince me she bought her's legitimately from some trading site.
---
All containers reset after a while, so the game cleans up what we have thrown away. If some gets to grab something useful to them before the reset then it's all good.
---
I got one send team invites to travel and share 
---
While there is only type of PA chassis, I don't recall there being any level limit.  If there are higher level pieces of PA attached, you can remove them and still enter the chassis.
---
Bobbleheads I keep just to sell, mags i will use immediately for the hell of it since they're not worth anything.  Neither i will keep for that special circumstance due to being a junk/mats hoarder
---
It's probably tank killer perk card?
---
On xbox my original spot up north seemed to be taken 30% of the time. Everytime I went there, their base wouldn't even be farming both nodes properly. 
---
Very frustrating. 
---
I wouldn't even have an issue if I could at least get a friggin' trophy for Casa Stomper...
---
Crops/water at camp.  Mine generates enough to cap out a couple vendors at least.  
---
Also, farm the boxcar east of Watoga station for the marine head armor plan.  Sells for ~27 caps each and costs a tiny amount of resources.
---
Welcome to pvp norms in any game. If someone accuses you of hacking and you are not, you are kicking their ass raw and should be filled with pride and use that energy to advance on in making that cry baby pay more.
---
Or you know log out and leave them feeling salty.
---
Compliment indeed!
---
** I send invites to travel and share 
---
Me and a group tried this, and it was a total flop. The Super mutants even stopped spawning at one point. 
---
I always send random invites because I have mutations. What I have to do now after your post?
---
Hehe. Yeah and although I am melee mostly I think melee damage can be mitigated easier.
---
I would use them but I forget about them.  Perhaps once I reach the endgame and know what specific fight I am going to run they will be more useful. But I think they will end up being sold in player vending if possible.
---
Yep. Ignoring things solves all your problems.
---
No problem with hoarders but do think respawn rates for all loot should be quicker between one player picking something up and another person coming along ..
---
Was in VTU the other day and virtually all containers were empty and not one bit of Ammo!
---
It's not a fusion core generator. It is just a fusion generator. It makes 100 power. You should be able to order your entire camp with it easy.
---
Yeah free fast travel is a huge motive of mine but it’s a two way street. You can use me and my camp as well. Also I tend to always give those who accept my requests aid 
---
Good to know, thanks.Will be using this on my 22 agility chameleon sniper.
---
Some of the file folders on desks are called "Detective Case Files". I'm hoping they are for future DLC!
---
Why ban dupers 
---
aNtI-aRmOuR rOlLiNg PiN
---
iGnOrEs 50% Of TaRgEt'S aRmOuR
---
Why? Do you use turrets? They eat a ton of budget. 
---
Ok,but where do I find the Keypad code?
---
I found an anti armor Gatling and since my current character is a bit of a mess and I rolled a new one for stealth rifles, I was planning on shifting to a heavy weapons build.  A few days later I found an assassins Gatling, so it must be a sign.  
---
As far as damage, I haven't really used them much yet, so I can't say.
---
It's in their best interest to ban them anyway because it's ruined the in game markets economy and is turning more and more people away from the game 
---
yeah, well, Phantom Menace made money too. So did The Last Airbender Movie. Also Grown Up 2. My point is that just because something is a financial success doesn't mean that it doesn't suck.
---
I always think I grab them but they are never in my inventory.
---
Sorry meant the level of the pieces not the chassis itself! 😖
---
Sure but you can get ATOMS just by playing the game, so you can buy everything in the store for free, it just takes a bit of time.
---
Also if you get caught with ATOM items you wont get your account banned.
---
I’ve never heard of the quest line for the nuka cola. Hell im lost with two quests that don’t even show blips on maps. “Find the next holotape” but we arnt giving you a blip to go look
---
That's good. Once you reach level 50 you can start completing quests and get the level 45/50 variant of the a weapon or armor reward
---
Over-repairing only increases damage on melee weapons except Grognak's Axe. It doesn't increase damage on the Gatling Gun.
---
But yeah, it is hellishly strong even with just Two Shot. I have a level 40 single star two-shot modded with a prime receiver and it shreds scorched enemies and scorchbeasts. It does decent damage to the SB Queen as well. I can only hope to one day get a level 50 two shot with faster fire rate and 90% reduced weight.
---
Praise the lord and pass the dick-measure, and we’ll all stay salty.
---
Yes. It’s not an independent paint though; it comes applied when you make the armor but you can’t reapply it if you paint the armor something else.
---
War. War Never Changes = *Micdrop
---
If you’re on a roof that means you’re not interrupting my activities. So you go ahead and wait for that shot you’ll never have 👌
---
Oh forsure. I wasn't aware of containers reseting. Any idea of the reset time? ~ I also drop loads of legendary stuff in that suitcase at Watoga) keep an eye out! 
---
It’s a “secret” quest. I’ll see if I can dig up the picture-map I followed to get it
---
It has been speculated that 76 was just test bed for future features; that they needed it as a stepping stone for the engine to be used (again) for Starfield and TES. No evidence, of course, but seems possible to at least a small extent. 
---
What this person said. It's easier to keep customers than it is to get new ones.
---
They cause server lag and disconnects, as well as destroying the "virtual" economy (player trading).
---
If you've ever been in a Scorchbeast Queen fight, where the Queen dies as soon as she spawns, you know the dupers were there to insta-kill it... you never got a shot in, so no loot for you.
---
That's why.
---
Im 85 and just about to finish Enclave quest line. Havent done anything else past the airport. I didnt have a tinkerers bench until after 50 when i finally found a plan haha
---
I fucking love this! I love to see a good karma story. Thank you for sharing this to the subreddit
---
Its more about the progress of it tbh. Completionist, and other than the ones with absurd numbers, its a list of things to accomplish.
---
Nope, I closed that tab. Just google FO76 Nuka paint, I’m sure there’s a guide out there 
---
My wife and I do. We specifically bought a second PS4 and TV just to do it, cause we were both hooked and it was causing tension. We got em set up side by side and sit on a little loveseat while we play. 
---
She’s L74 now doing a Sneaky Rifle build with a nice TSE, and I’m 128 running around with broken Unarmed weapons, which is nice cause she can do the things I can’t. 
---
I mean, does anyone actually turn off fallout76? I thought we all just put weights on our w keys and went to sleep or work or whatever else people do.
---
Not everyone who has duplicated items is a duper, so why would deleting all duped items and banning those who had them be a good thing? 
---
You’d have to be severely lacking in common sense to actually believe he was suggesting that duper’s should be rewarded.  He is simply saying that this would practically remove a majority of the player base and would likely completely kill the game. 
---
If they could track it down to just those who were duping, then that’d be great.  But not really a likely possibility 
---
The wife &amp; I have mutant builds and had a similar problem with getting mutations.  We fixed it in one night by removing the mutations &amp; starting over.  Then make sure you don't die while gathering radiation.  
---
a good chunk of their total playerbase has duped, knowingly bought something off a duper or was gifted something from a duper. someone might even have looted something off the floor.
---
even *if* they could single out ids, they'd be getting rid of something like 65% of the playerbase. that's a great plan considering it keeps dwindling every day.
---
Some people like government meddling so much that they invent it.
---
That is fair, but imagine you are running the show at Bethy. 
---
You've just launched a major game, it's a huge project with blockbuster-level investment, and it's getting very bad feedback for being unbalanced.
---
Do you do the hard work to fix the bloody issue and save the entire title? 
---
OR
---
Accept that the entire title is doomed, drop it completely, and be known forever as the developer that couldn't be bothered to do anything about it??
---
This should be a very easy question to answer...
---
Modern couches
---
10mm's are pretty much the only decent drops I get (and I say decent because I have a pistol build character, they would be useless to anyone else, lol).  
---
Have a lvl 15 2-shot
---
a lvl 45 2-shot  
---
and a lvl 45 anti-armor explosive
---
So you're not farming with your camp turrets at the window then it's no problem. 
---
Not if you have Contractor on when you repair all. Then it is just 1 crop and 1 fertilizer per broken crop.
---
Ok I’ll be on in a bit
---
I have a habit of selling them all, though there's a 40 atom achievement for using one of each. Some people abuse the explosive bottleheads.
---
The damage cards always did. Maybe it’s the armor penetration or cripple effects perks? I can’t think of any others that are Rifle specific.
---
I've had this same issue.  Do to audio settings and set it to none then completely exit the map screen.  Now go back and set it to area or team whichever you want.  This usually solves it for me.
---
I have my camp set up as a two story with a unlocked visitors section downstairs and a locked door going upstairs to my area. 
---
I used to leave it all unlocked as a low level until someone came it while I was crafting and attacked. Whatever gun they had was able to kill me with one shot and then they sat on my roof and sniped me till I left the server. 
---
If things were balanced it would be more fun, but but a new player who’s never experienced pvp it really ruined things and made me avoid other players until I was more likely to survive. 
---
Now I play with my son and try to help lower level players. 
---
Thanks for the answers people. Even if i do not know why it was downvoted. Was that joke so bad? (Yeah i know it was)  
---
Though i got the information i needed and it may help others.
---
Holy crap my Enclave loving heart just skipped a beat, that would be so awesome to have in game. I too love the look of T-60 it has that iconic T-45 bulkiness but looks way better. Unfortunately I doubt we will get any Enclave painjobs, at least before any DLC that is. Long live the Enclave, LONG LIVE AMERICA. 
---
Thank you I will try that
---
Except that the title isn't doomed. TSE weapons aren't dooming game. So that analogy doesn't work.
---
Well I’m glad you came around.
---
I don't take everything - but I am tempted to kick the door in...    
---
Nothing is more tempting than a locked door.
---
that's because Bethesda didn't bother putting a cap on bobbleheads. so you can just spam explosive ones to raise your damage to over 1 million.
---
How dare people want to keep the stuff they worked hard to get /s
---
That’s hilarious 
---
Thank you !!! Any chance you know how to get the plan ?
---
I would love that.  What's your name in game?  PC?
---
I'm sure google knows 
---
There was server lag and disconnects before duping began 
---
I've always gone to the town of Welch and bought treasure maps from the vending machine in the middle of it. You'll get three maps and finding the treasures results in about 100 titanium, iirc. It is enough to build the armor and repair it a few times. 
---
I’m interested!
---
I killed two with miniguns recently and got the minigun. Actually one was a little glitched since I managed to pick one off the floor directly and then scored a second one from the body itself.
---
when you stop being an drama queen.  so, never.
---
Ah thats what I was confused about lmfao okay
---
Haha it’s pretty funny. Even my non-TSE (just Instigating plus 25% fire rate) Gatling with my full damage heavy build (adrenaline, Adrenal Reaction, bloody mess, 9/9 Heavy Weapons, Stabilized) shocked a group of Prime Nukers (several who HAD TSE of various types) with how fast I took down a SB flying around after we cleared the queen and were just fucking around. 
---
People are welcome to play the game how they want 
---
Thanks for the help!!!!
---
reddit does not constitute the entire playerbase. most people don't know what it is or even care about a "healthy economy" in a game without rmts.
---
this is the only place where the market meme is taken seriously.
---
Alas, if it only took six seconds to unplug it and reboot it...
---
&gt; Over-repairing only increases damage on melee weapons except Grognak's Axe. It doesn't increase damage on the Gatling Gun.
---
oh, wth!  I thought it was all weapons except grognaks
---
Without the old one? I'll try that, thanks.
---
they'll downvote you, but you're not wrong.
---
I never except team invites because I hate people :/
---
The only good thing about their brains and stuff is you can make a great stew from them if you have all the parts and the stat bonuses/healing they give if you just grill them... thats about it.
---
Just something to be like a, "Yea, keep going!" Sort of bit.
---
Like, if you've ever played Dark Souls, there's an exponential curve for how effective leveling a STAT is (Not to mention how difficult it gets to Level. At one point, I had to play through an entirety of the game four times to gain enough points to Level up, if I didn't die and didn't grind). Not only did it become much more difficult to Level, but the gains from the Leveling were so mundane. Levels 1-30 were massive gains in a ability. Then it cut to half of what you had from Leveling, then to a quarter, until it reached a point where the last thirty Levels of a STAT combined amounted to the boost of Leveling once in the begin.
---
If they keep increasing the gap between when you can gain a SPECIAL, then put caps on Max SPECIAL at different points, it could be a very balanced system.
---
-IE: Gaining 10 SPECIAL between 50-100, 5 SPECIAL between 100-150/200, etc. Then it could be like, Max in one category being 17, 20, 22, 25, etc. With each grouping. 
---
I only lock my base to keep wildlife and random enemies out. I lock my water pumps so I actually get my water.
---
Sorry, I don't know if I deadpanned too hard, or you did. :)
---
thanks going to test my mettle against one now!
---
Thanks, I actually wouldn't mind that :)
---
I tend to join randoms to help with quests (although im a low level player) but i ignore the first invite but if they invite me a again i will ignore it again if then they dont send another one i will invite them to me just to be on the safe side of this 
---
So far only the nuka-girl suit is my only regret really. It looks pretty neat, but the effect wore off pretty quickly, especially once I noticed it removes underarmor and you can't remove the hood.
---
If I had the atoms still, I could have purchased the blackbird paints instead... Oh well.
---
So duping is fine then?
---
1
---
Melee...lol
---
Update: After I switched servers the item was gone, so I’m guessing it finally registered as having been used.
---
Same.  It so damn fun, Lawnmower Man I call it.  Mow it all down.
---
I know I'll probably piss a lot of people off but ...though I'm enjoying Fallout 76, I won't buy another Bethesda game so early after release. I'm not saying that I wont buy another game but I'll wait a while until they work out the issues or if it's another single player game, until the modders work out the kinks.
---
So I suppose we should just go the other way and open the dev room,  throw away the script and just make it a complete sandbox for these entitled dummies?
---
/r/woosh
---
NP. I'm interested in hearing what you find. I'm still looking for confirmation on what, exactly, causes these to spawn. It'd be keen if you were to update the thread if you find anything at all.
---
ackchyually, it's *r/woooosh

^^^^^I'm ^^^^^a ^^^^^bot. ^^^^^Complaints ^^^^^should ^^^^^be ^^^^^sent ^^^^^to ^^^^^u/stumblinbear ^^^^^where ^^^^^they ^^^^^will ^^^^^be ^^^^^subsequently ^^^^^ignored
---
You can actually learn how to craft a muzzle break for it. The issue is...the muzzle break is the only attachment for that slot, and each LMG comes with it attached
---
You know, I've put in at least a hundred hours since release, and I don't think the game was that unstable even during release.  
---
There were a lot of significant exploits on release yea,  but as far as bugs, the worst things I ran into was server disconnects from time to time - I think I hit around 10-20 during the first 3 or so weeks.  
---
The only other thing which was lame but I could deal with was an unscrapable water purifier bug which was just recently fixed with the Jan 10th patch.
---
But that was it.
---
What weapons are you trying to use? Stick with high damage weapons, and use different types. 308 Rifle for long range, shotgun for short range. Don’t use auto weapons, you use too much ammo at low levels
---
Lmao wow 
---
I pvp all the time because I love it. I look for it as much as I can.  The truth is, there are loads of players out there that refuse to use or simply don't have these weapons yet. 
---
PVP is 10X better when none of the players involved uses these OP-god guns. The gameplay makes all the sense in the world as soon as these weapons are gone. 
---
The amount of players that already have and rely on these OP guns is a huge problem. The best way to enjoy pvp is to avoid them like the plague. 
---
The only people that argue with Tip 1, are the kind of players  that utterly rely on these OP god-weapons because they are so powerful. And they are exactly the kind of players that should be avoided. Once you do try and avoid them as much as you can, PVP in F76 is actually brilliant!  Which is why I ban these OP guns in all the hunter/hunted games I organize. 
---
Thanks for all the Info!
---
I think the stuff we put in containers is lost after about 4 hours, but I could be totally wrong. At the very least they reset around 18 hours anyway. I don't know for sure it could be less.
---
Lol just highlighting your logic.
---
That perk, which doesn't work today, doesn't help me at all.
---
I don’t understand why it has a slot for just about every mod, but only 1 mod. 
---
The small hotel in Flatwoods has a room full of dumbbells that is great for lead. Vault Tec University (Morgantown) has two places inside. The main middle building (where you get the overseer holotape) has a room with exercise equipment on the first floor with dumbbells (check for weights next to the bench press too). In the actual vault, there's a few dumbbells and weights near the exercise bikes on a shelf. 
---
There's also another weight room in Charleston fire department. If questline hasn't sent you there yet, it should soon. (If you don't find any of the weights above, you may need to server hop once or twice. People tend to grab those)
---
Acid and cloth can make gunpowder on chemistry bench. If you farm scorch, take all their weapons (and ammo) and scrap em for steel. 
---
Don't forget to go into pipboy junk tab, look at very bottom for button to use for Component View. From their, you can mark what components (what you currently have on you) you want and whenever you come across an item that has it, there will be a magnifying glass next to its name. 
---
I can jump on later tonight if you want ign is ieatspf50
---
Messaged me on Xbox
---
That was most likely me and you are welcome. Unless you are not on pc then it wasn't me. But yeah, if I am force spawning crap near the building anything I don't use or want I toss into the ice chest so feel free to look. All I ask is that you guys who go there, don't run around inside the building for so long because in order for someone to spawn them, you got to be outside. Also stop using instant kill weapons, some of us want the xp and items.
---
The main problem is comparing the games engine to other software. Other companies fix the bugs in there software as they progress through development. Bethesda doesn't unless its completely game breaking, so on the surface its the same pos engine with the same pos bugs no matter how the undercarriage has been upgraded.
---
It's more like comparing it to a Jeep. lets say you got a Jeep that you love to drive off-road a lot and its covered in mud. But it keeps breaking down over the years so you replace the engine, the tires, the transmission, seats, etc, etc, etc. But in the end its still covered in mud and looks like shit because it was never washed.
---
I know I was just asking because I’m on Xbox and don’t have that much caps left. I’m buying another weapon tonight for my leftover caps
---
also, repair all is the single best way to have your mods consumed as scrap without you knowing, because the dialog does not show source of materials.
---
Graphics mods I can’t speak to, they may be a gray area. I’ve been using several quality  of life mods (Perk Loadout Manager, better inventory) since Launch, and zero issues.
---
And run around nekked
---
Pretty much them TBH, 308 is like gold dust 😒
---
This gun kills ghouls
---
Unfortunately Bethesda has said they have no way to track items, so they can't track Dupers
---
Could possibly be your hard drive. Even with the ps pro it can be an issue. 
---
It gets better, hang in there.
---
My approach at low levels is just pick up weaps as I go and use the ammo type of what I'm killing atm.  Later, you can specialize.  
---
But ya, it sucks and is poorly done by BGS.
---
There’s nothing to boost defense (except Emergency Protocols for chest, sort of). Excavator isn’t military armor, it has the lowest defenses of any PA. 
---
Thanks mate. Here’s hoping we both get lucky. 
---
Thanks, this helps
---
Especially the gunpowder crafting 👍
---
&gt;  The frequency of these encounters with people griefing seems like it’s gotten to be so high I can’t really enjoy my camp or building in it.
---
Unfortunately it's a content issue.  Players have put 100's of hours into the game and find themselves with nothing to do.  Only fresh source of interactions are other players.
---
not really. just saying banning a huge chunk of your playerbase isn't in your best interests. or even driving away honest players who unknowingly bought a dupe if they wiped them.
---
&gt;aww did the SBQ die too fast?
---
like it's been addressed multiple times, the Queen dies so fast because of Beth's own incompetence. they didn't cap bobbleheads.
---
I for one agree, ban the accounts of those who utilized exploits and remove all the items that were spawned from this. If players lose out on some in-game caps, they can deal with it. For those who spend real money buying in-game items on PayPal... well I hope they either learn their lesson or direct litigation against the sellers.
---
However I also doubt Bethesda's ability to actually do this because of the complete lack of forethought they exercised in trying to provide Fallout as an online multiplayer experience. 
---
I hope that Bethesda has both the means and the will to do something about this, because the economy such as it was has been ruined.
---
Are you on xbox? I might have a spare set of the bos chest and/or leg plans id sell you. Ill check in a minute
---
That’s a queer thing to do.
---
No because it's against TOS and destabilizes the server.  
---
An easy way is (if you’re good enough) kill a bunch of death claws. They always have black titanium.
---
Rats. I was hoping I wouldn’t have to grind for an entire new set. I really don’t want to get rid of my 100 carry weight
---
LOL! Everytime I try to discover new locations I almost always run into a wall (literally)! The location is almost always 150 feet above me when I finally get to the icon on my HUD! I then have to spend 15 min trying to find a way up!
---
I killed two charred ghouls right before i started on the Scorch beasts actually, I trimmed it out cause it wasn't the focus of the video.
---
tell me yours when i get on PC tomorrow i will hit you with message here. OFC PC
---
Holy shit I got one traded to me as well. Should I send in a ticket or something or just scrap it?
---
The game is great. Don’t believe the reviews
---
I got the tents too, but I like them...
---
They are a massive PITA to place - but I've found two places to use them:    
---
* On a runway to the main door (like a hotel)   
---
* On a open-air roof - making a sort of roof-top BBQ area. (Astroturf flooring makes that look awesome)
---
... highlighting MY logic? Haha oh shit man, you just played yourself. Have fun, I’m done. 
---
If it's a kid, he shouldn't be there. Period.
---
If it's a young teen, he's probably the one _doing_ the griefing, because they tend to be pretty sociopathic at that age.
---
I remain unswayed.
---
How else are they supposed to achieve a false sense of superiority?
---
Yeah thats bad info. If youre quick enough to loot it you keep it. 
---
Have you tried out the splitter mod on it yet? Its pretty great.
---
my friendlist doesn't work again, hope it'll be fixed soon
---
And then you get reported for griefing.
---
Judging at the state of the game's release.. I doubt they can pull a ban wave off vs dupers. They're only banning people using mods because of the .dll injection code.
---
Scorched are your best source of 308 at that level, hit some scorch-heavy areas (Morgantown airport, Camden park, etc) and you should collect a decent amount. Camden park has the bonus of lots of can traps for ammo crafting; just need gunpowder which you can get a little of from the raider camp in back
---
Buying real money stuff always puts me in a state of 'now i must use it and never take it off'. I hate that. That's why i only used my earned atoms to buy the parquet for camp and succulents.
---
Mainly due to my husband. He loves that shit and with gleefully enact revenge if I’m attacked lol. 
---
Yes, this happened to me with Speed Demon. Since it was the last one that I was looking for, and since I managed to steer clear of Herd Immunity and Empath, I decided to just let it lie and live life without it. 
---
Same symptoms as your report: I got the mutation just before dying. It does not show up on my visible list of mutations. But no amount of additional mutating will let me gain it again; it's already been checked off the list.
---
Good to know from others' reports that a serum won't do the trick either. That's 4000 caps I just saved by not throwing them away at this bug.
---
Well now I've seen 3 of the last 4 SBQ's drop to zero health suddenly. Different servers &amp; players. I don't even hear a shotgun blast or see explosions the moment it happens. It can't be cheaters every time.
---
The last one dropped just 14 harpoons.
---
Do you have anything level 20-30? I'd buy them for more than 58 caps if that doesn't go against the terms of service.
---
I'm hoping that means in the future we will be able to put more on it. It's pretty ridiculous that with a mg42, you're not even allowed to put a bigger drum on
---
White springs is great for starter gear, that super gambler's luck at a good 3 star but, and exp. Hunting down legendaries is by far the better way to get 2 stars and higher. 
---
Another thing with Scorched and Super Mutants. "I'm firing my assault rifile!"... drops a combat knife, or "I'm poking you with my spear!"... drops a lead pipe. 
---
I feel like you are speaking from experience 
---
How nobody get the reference 
---
Well, if you get insanely lucky or drop a lot of caps, you can keep your 100 Carry weight with 2 calibrated shocks on an x-01/t-51/t-60 suit. 
---
Haha then you’re just giving him what he wants lol
---
I think everything I picked up was 40+ but I’ll have quick look for you 
---
My husband and I just started playing Fallout together recently. My son got an xbox for Christmas so I was excited we would finally be able to play together. Up until that point I had just been watching him play. Which is not nearly as much fun! He’s a much higher level than me, I’m just a level 19, so he is constantly saving my hind end lol. 
---
Just let me know if you fix it and I can help you out
---
I could go buy explosive bobbles off 100 different people for 100-200 caps each and one shot the queen too. Sure duping them is easier, but anyone can do it. 
---
No doubt. I mean, look how they carefully took all those modded fixes from FO4 and seamlessly integrated them into FO76!
---
Did you actually read the TOS then? Because it pretty much rules out griefing in section 8.
---
You said it hardly matters i can't use the perk after suggesting it buds.
---
Is it north or south of Janet's?
---
Because anyone with a lot of good loot hanging with their friends is a duper. This is almost a witchhunt post, sorry but it is.
---
I've greatly enjoyed it, despite the bugs. It certainly has them, but I wouldn't say it's worse than any previous FO title. I'm a solo player, none of my buddies will buy the game, so idk about his grouping up impacts the game. I'm level 122 with about 200 hours in so far, and I still log in to play every night.
---
I went into the game with with the mindset of fallout 4 with a bigger map and online and not fallout 5. I wasnt disappointed because that's what the game basically is.
---
If keys go much lower I may buy a 2nd copy to easily mule items like spare scrap and what not.
---
Sounds like typical arrogant BOS propaganda to me. *twirls not-evil twirly mustache*
---
This is an awesome shout!
---
It's fun to try though, I enjoyed the fear :D 
---
Roughly the whole west of the map should be easy most of the time for your level now. Below lvl 45 you will struggle on the eastern part of the map when high level players are near. Don't be shy to use comms to ask for help when needed. Most people are glad to help you out of any trouble. A very small group of players prefers to 'send' higher lvl enemies after you, watch you die, and then take your loot, but most are nice and don't even that cross their mind.
---
Just two more tips in case you didn't know. 
---
\- The traders are divided in factions. Traders of a faction all share one stash of 200 caps. You often see they have zero caps (on PC at least), but if you sell them an item for 1 cap you'll see the actual amount they have. After you bring a faction's trade stash to zero, a 20 hour timer will start before they've resetted to 200.
---
\- Always upgrade your weapons and armor to the highest level available to you. The max lvl's for armor and weapons are either lvl 45 or 50, depending on the type. 
---
Probably Tank Killer or Tormentor then.
---
yep right by the door. Pro tip. If I don't need junk and I am not the one doing the spawning I dump all\~\~\~\~\~ the junk and ammo I don't need into the trash can next to the ice machine, So those of you who are looking for legendaries in the cooler, look in the trash can sometimes to see a list of all kinds of waste, radaway deluted and so on.
---
They will just not accept trade offers anymore.  I hope bethesda gets the game undercontrol soon
---
That was literally all I did and frankly still do at lvl 41 without a super solid gear set. Take out what i can and if i cant try and cripple. I always bring a ton of stims to revive anyone who goes down and i have a low level piece of armor i purposely keep on that give 50% chance to revive myself if i go down
---
HAPPIEST OF CAKE DAYS!!!!!!!
---
It has the mod deep pocketed 
---
I don’t know what the original weight of the armor is but does this add up?
---
Yeah I have yet to loot even one single upside-down shotgun
---
Is it 2 shot explosive?  If so then he probably had Demo Expert equipped.  Also Science Expert perks raise Energy Damage too.  There is also an Energy Weapon Bobblehead which, IF he used it to up damage for sale, makes him a used car salesman.  
---
Grounded DOES affect the Gauss. And Class Freak is buggy as shit, take it off and check how much the damage changes, you may be losing the whole 50%
---
/u/QuantumDrej What a Shill and Sheeple you are!!
---
#JustSayNoToFallout76
---
Class freak with grounded is currently busted. It shows -12% but still takes away 50%. This is absolutely the reason your gauss dmg will suck. You can not use the gauss with grounded. 
---
From what I could gather it was with some people who were running cheat engine while the game was running 
---
I have read that class freak is not currently reducing the grounded debuff.
---
So... witchhunting? Sorry, I'll take dupers over that toxic thought process.
---
The chances of finding such bobbleheads are marginal, and you'd really spend at least 10 minutes logging into each other's server to trade the bobble head... only to blow it all to kill a queen instantly? Dumping 1k caps into a single queen kill?
---
Nah, it's the dupers. 
---
I mean he could, but it's not profitable.
---
I don’t view it as griefing, I view it as removing people who weren’t there when I logged in.
---
Haha I forgot this video was even a thing, the remote in the ass is the best part!  I'm sorry you don't care.
---
A set of assassin sentinel armor will make any gun, even explosive tickle, PvP tip number one: stop relying on power armor!
---
Did you have a mic to ask them to kill you?  I never shoot at anyone even if they're wanted. The other day someone asked me to kill them to get rid of their bounty, and I had no problem doing that. I just don't want to shoot someone out of nowhere and have them think I'm a jerk. 
---
That's what I had understood. But I'm not clear on my sources, so I don't want to state it as 100% fact. 
---
This comment right here
---
Gauss rifle is a hybrid, it fires a projectile but is a energy weapon 
---
I haven't tried the perk yet, but it sounds promising. 
---
Armour mods are handy but the most relevant one's to this debate are very rare. A lot of players wont have the hours it takes to collect them, so saying:  "just play for ages until you find the right gear, then you'll be fine", is not a very actionable tip at all. 
---
The CORE problem is the existence of these OP weapons. They allow highly invested players to dominate lesser invested (the vast majority of)  players.  No good for pvp. 
---
A guide on how to counter one single weapon in the game would be filled with perks, armor and perhaps other weapons that would take a long time and a lot of devotion to collect. It would a be a guide that's helpful for the few and not the many. One that is relevant for the long-term and not actionable right now. 
---
The only people that argue with Tip 1, are the kind of players that utterly rely on these OP god-weapons because they are so powerful. And they are exactly the kind of players that should be avoided. Once you do try and avoid them as much as you can, PVP in F76 is actually brilliant!  Which is why I ban these OP guns in all the hunter/hunted games I organize. 
---
YOU fail to comprehend what's applicable to the MANY and you focus your narrow view on what might be handy for the FEW (yourself). YOU are the one clearly showing your ignorance 
---
Sorry about the poor quality video
---
I hope when I'm playing I'm a friends camp that you come and harass me so I can report you for harassment and level your base as many times as I can before you give up and leave the server. 
---
Stop the God damn witch hunting. A few players in a camp together doesn't mean a damn thing. It's a multiplayer game. Friends play together. 
---
Dude, message me your gamertag. We need to build together.
---
People have found them at like level 80 (just search the subreddit) so there probably isn't an upper limit, but maybe a lower limit?
---
At least in my eyes, 76 has taken some of shine off BGS’s halo. When I saw their logo at the start of Skyrim and FO4, I felt something uniquely positive in terms of anticipation of the game to come. And, you know, expected bugs...but still, they made stuff so uniquely cool their products were special to me.
---
76 isn’t completely bad and I have fun playing it, but it’s a hotter mess than anything I’ve seen from BGS before. Even more damning in my estimation, many of the most fundament problems with 76 came from deliberately lazy development choices. They built a multiplayer game without giving customer support any server-side tools at all, ffs.
---
I’ll buy other BGS products, but they’re no longer an auto-buy for me, and 76 is the last creation engine game I’ll buy at anything less than 75% off.
---
Sadly, humans fucking suck even without anonymity, all around really.
---
It's always amusing. Some level 6 took shots at me so I shot back. Him and all his buddies ganged up and called me a bully. I'd start reporting this to Bethesda because they're probably guilty of duping at this point anyway.
---
Nice! I shall toast to your victory! 
---
thank you )
---
Then why even put in PVP? I mean targeted harassment and abuse is one thing but attacking bases is there for a purpose. Not everyone has to be nice and get along. Raiders exist for a reason
---
Lol so this is like power armor for them?
---
"That base wasn't there when I logged in, better blow it up!"
---
Yeah, shits alot more balanced than people realize, there are op defensive perks and armor affixes just like offensive weapons
---
There were like 3x 3 star enemies in the mix so yeah that's key... but then I had another 3 star a few mins later heading north along the rows of rooms and got a 3 star who gave me Wonderglue... WTF?
---
Party Girl and Cola Nut though.
---
My secret to domination; unarmed with those two. 
---
At the low end, a level 50 Unarmed weapon like Knuckles hit for 200 a hit.
---
Fully modded Power Fists are 300+ with no procs, low hp or drugs.
---
500+ with whisky (+6 Str), proper meats and Fury. Over 1k at lower hp.
---
Not really, but to each their own. 
---
Losing level based caps is still silly, no matter how you want to change my view. 
---
They can be on the floor without being in the inventory? Damn I should check that out 
---
No turrets. They are useless.
---
Sadly this is correct.
---
A less effective means would be to ban those holding excessive amounts of items. No one "innocently picked up" 10,000 TSE handmade rifles and proceeded to obliviously waddle through the rest of the game.
---
Or they could just have it buff nearby teammates.
---
I was build a few camps ago an was wondering the same thing. An I was right. After the patch my camp was 100% maxed an when I logged in there was 6 lights some walls an fences that all showed up out of no where. I was able to finally scrap them an get so much more. 
---
I just screened it on my account and I have the name and screens about the person who traded to me. Then I dropped it in a random point in the wasteland. I'll sent the ticket tomorrow or prob I won't. I think there are tons of player in our situation. I think we're pretty safe
---
They won't be removed from PvP, so stop saying "when they are removed" learn to deal. 
---
I agree, when he said he was going to get me banned. I thought “ My work here is done.”
---
Bobbles have permanent in game spawns so finding them is not hard. If someone wants to log into a few different servers to buy them, then that's their business, not yours. The curator perk is currently busted so you can keep the bobble head bonus from ever running out so it's completely worth it. And 1k caps is nothing. 
---
Isn't there a tambourine on a stool as well?
---
Glassy cavern I think that’s what it’s called
---
Though, Pvping needs a lot of updating. I’m sure we can agree on that. 
---
Okay yeah, I just fount it little confusing because it wasn't me complaning about using stims.
---
I've seen some really fast queen kills. Usually, I can make it to the spawn and wipe her down to 1/3 life solo....
---
But this was different.
---
He's correct.  I tested this by having a friend stand against a wall and measuring how far from him I could shoot the wall before he took damage, first without the perk and then with max ranks.  The distance was not affected.
---
During the q&amp;a where in private servers were first mentioned the response seemed completely ad hoc, improvised, like they'd never considered it but didn't want to say no.  I'd be surprised if even early planning has been assigned or scheduled.
---
Appreciate the guide! I've been doing steel the hard way and leveling areas with high concentrations of mutants/scorched for scrapping weapons with scrapper. It's worked for making over 100K rounds of 50 cal over the past two months at least.
---
I'm in the UK so depending on your location our timezones may not much up but my GT is smcdonald09
---
Only level 24 but keen on joining to explore :) anyone else looking for more people to play with then feel free to add me
---
That makes sense, sorry. So used to PC I didn't think about messaging on the console.
---
the wasteland reveals everyone's true nature
---
That looks great! I'm sure the actual one is gonna end up looking like the Iron Patriot... 
---
Oh my goodness, this is amazing. Nice work!
---
can you tell me where you found holotape 2 (I'm looking for 1 as well ) 
---
I don't suppose you have a map of those 7? Or a list? 
---
Complete the excavator power armor questline and you get one 100%
---
I wouldn't even be mad about selling on eBay if I didn't know the items were duped. That's the part that grinds my gears. People are selling items that they didn't even have to work to obtain in game legitimately. 
---
Wow level 9 and struggling in a survival game, go figure.
---
Good bot
---
The dev room is a completely different thing to duping, only a small amount of players have gotten into it.
---
FO4 wasn't a drastic change for the series I think, but a notable one. The gunplay, crafting, addition of building,  and world scope (geographic size/detail and number of locations) all changed for the better, I think objectively. Meanwhile, the story and dialogue seemed to fall off, and I think that was the main point of contention for many players, and why the popular opinion on the game was 'it's poop'.
---
That said, if you're the type of person who enjoys the exploration and kill-loot-craft aspects of FO4, you're in for a treat. The game is pretty vast and I don't think I had fully explored even half of the Commonwealth by the time I reached several hundred hours in on my third character. To this day I have over 1000 hours logged with mods (though likely a few hundred at least are idles), and I still haven't actually completed everything. I've probably full cleared about 75% of the game's locations, and discovered 90% of them...
---
One last thing -- I highly recommend you check out a mod called Horizon. It's one of FO4's biggest overhaul mods, and the gameplay changes are startlingly good. Everything from loot to medicine to building and combat are improved, in some cases vastly improved, and it's an amazing experience if you value immersion and challenge. Horizon FO4 basically consumed my life for a couple months and stands tall in the pantheon of my top five favourite gaming experiences of all time. :3
---
3-4K caps for serums 
---
Losing level based caps
---
Not having enough for said serum.
---
You do the math. 
---
Congrats! I'm on xbox and half the achievements still won't pop for me. 
---
No shit, I did buy an online game. I also wasn’t complaining about PvP, just whiny bitches.
---
Ahh I always wondered why they had different loot while falling vs when I go back to pick everything up. 
---
Very simply put.
---
I'm down, my friend just left. But I live in us eastern time. Just add me on disc
---
That a little stronger to the negative response than the one I got. My guy didn't say anything at all one way or the other. Quite interesting to say the least. 
---
I mean, we were atleast 5-6 players fragging him to hell and back earlier on, some above lvl 200. I think he was just bugged TBH. Bethesda and all :P
---
I was there from level 50 to 150. Sadly now it’s always taken so I moved to a similar place in a high level area
---
I hit lvl 94 yesterday and all my friends are pissed I haven't done the quests yet so I can't go into the bunkers with them to launch nukes.
---
Ive been running around clearing Blast Zones and other locations looking for loot and helping people. I have only finished the Responders quests.
---
I really like how large the game map is. 
---
Ive been trying for a legendary one. Maybe one with the Quad effect so it has a 300rnd drum. 
---
The other day in Watoga, I killed two Scorchbeasts and they each dropped a Prime Receiver Plan. I was shocked, but I usually get nothing from scorchbeasts as well. 
---
I got my TSE lever action legitimately. It dropped for me and I'll be damned if I'm not using it. I'd love to use it on you if I ever see you in the wasteland. Explosions are a thing of beauty and arguably very stylish. It could also be pointed out that ballistic ammo requires a small explosion to produce the velocity behind the projectile (except Gauss rifles and crossbows, and energy weapons) so EVERYONE is using "explosive" weapons. Tard.
---
So you’re gonna tell me as I plow into the horde and kill it all and then some doofuses show up after I’m done are entitled to beat on me and bust up my armor? Nah, bro, not gonna fly.
---
Plasma rifle. 200% durability repaired. Flamer mod. Breaks after 2 reloads. It melts everything in front of it and itself.
---
This is awesome inspiration! I'm going for a shotgunner build as well. :)
---
Do you need a separate Xbox account to have a second character
---
If you are missing achievements that you would've earned in the B.E.T.A, then you would have to make a new character to earn them for real. Bethesda announced it shortly after launch.
---
I find it hilarious that people are so upset with their continued use of a game "engine".
---
As if companies need to build a new engine from the floor up every four years or something. 
---
I always assumed it was a Zetan. The thought never occurred to me that it's little feet were standing inside there though.
---
Hell. Some people here are so toxic that even having one TSE you can be called out to be duper.
---
I play with my dad (both of us are long time Fallout fans), my boyfriend (with our dual ps4 setup) and a bunch of good friends I’ve met in game since the release. 
---
There are bugs (some that make for great photos, as is the usual with Fallout games. Others might frustrate you a bit) and the PvP could use some work (but if you encounter people you don’t want to PvP with, either block them and fast travel away or leave the server).
---
Overall, though, I’m level 115 and still enjoying the game :) 
---
What is your PSN gamer tag? Do you still have all this stuff?
---
I played since launch and have been craving new content but I lost hope a bit a go. Think it’s going to be mostly atom shop stuff for the long run sadly
---
Take a chill pill, they’re already banning duper’s. Just very slowly. Easy to detect them when they have 1mill inventory on them. 
---
Level up an alt to 15, make your way to Watoga train station, and bam, handmade plans will show up. May take a hop or two.
---
I'm sure he was absolutely titillated with my response. Not my proudest moment.  
---
Nah I did make a new character for those. There are some like completing certain events that just don't pop. I've tried a few times and gave up
---
Happens to me all the time in 3rd person mode. I usually just thrash around until it goes away.
---
I always thought maybe the game thought I was stuck in a Cranberry Bog trench since that where it happens the most, but looks like you're somewhere else.
---
This happens a lot to me. The second someone threatens to report me in chat or writing I report them. That way they have an open report before I do. I have had people tell me some pretty messed up shit before. 
---
Also they aren't as super overpowered as people assume. Ignorance is very powerful amongst these people. The bobbleheads stacking indefinitely and being duped are the REAL issue.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that!
---
They hinted at new vaults opening (either for exploring or dungeons of sort), new PvP mode, and more quests and events. Don't expect any of these to come out this month tho.
---
Which events?
---
Yeah, a quad explosive LMG is probably the best roll you can get. I got lucky with a max level two shot LMG a while back, it's honestly somewhat ridiculous. I have to reload every two seconds while shooting, but I could see the scorchbeast queen's health bar going down noticeably with each drum
---
They're as real as you want them to be.
---
I've made some wasteland buddies, just show up and tag along like a lost child, eventually someone will engage you in conversation..If only to ask if your lost..and that's your "in". Work that angle a little bit and before you know it you've got buddies too.
---
I want no new content until the games fixed.  Mostly the duping pussies
---
I'm 44 and just did the Enclave quest line last night. Hooo boy, it was a bit of madness. I thought "Oh I need another vendor, I'll just unlock Enclave... I've got an hour before sleep..."
---
Three hours later-- and a SHITLOAD of loot the richer-- I was finally accepted as a member. Good times. xD
---
I love everything about you. &lt;3
---
I use them on the spot. Only keep explosive and small arms to use for queen fights.
---
Selling them for 25 caps? lol,you get that in 4 muties,but a session of extra strengh is much better.
---
The breach and clear one specifically. I've completed that a bunch of times but no achievement 
---
Those are both great perks. But Ammosmith doesn't become available until level thirty-something, and Super Duper can only be taken once you get to level 50. They're very useful for keeping you supplied with ammo at high level, especially for high rate of fire weapons, but they're not going to do much to help the OP.
---
Gatt\_, I think your best bet is to get a melee weapon and try to kill as many shotgun wielding ghouls and scorched as possible. They tend to have a fair number of shells on them. Or just flat out ask over voice when there are high level players around. Many higher level players have tons of ammo that they don't need; at least I know I do.
---
Well that's just stupid 
---
On the main screen under 'Play' it says 'Character' click that and then click 'New' 
---
BOOWM! 
---
Shit, my kid practically raised herself.
---
I hoard. I have a problem. I tell myself “You’ll use them some day.” Nope. They are just chilling. Taking up that sweet 1.00 weight. I’m not proud of it. Magazines, too. 
---
I used robot hacking on a legendary robot once and somehow doing that spawned two more next to it. *That* was a weird bug. The loot on all three was still one star crap though.
---
Well, you could always .... You know.... Read.
---
Like reading that Bethesda post about the time frame of when the first batch of new content is coming out. 
---
Mostly Atomic Shop stuff for the long run? Are you stoned? 
---
Bethesda already has an image problem lately, imagine they bailed on content?
---
Its always been an energy weapon. I dont think they'll change that.
---
Have you attempted it after they fixed it in the early December Patch? I know Bethesda fixed it around that time period, hence the ability to 100%.
---
I think someone's just upset they don't have/ have been killed with these weapons. They are in the game and drop legit. Calling people who use them because they are BiS unskilled is ignorant. The people, myself included, use them because they are the best. We are smart. You are not.
---
Who needs ammo when you can **FUCKING TEAR PEOPLE APART WITH YOUR BARE GOD DAMN HANDS!**
---
&gt;Also, the player with the TSE gat or .50 cal unloading into the SBQ? Walking in front of him/her is not smart. 
---
This, this so many times over. Honestly, idgaf if you keep stuff off me or not in prime zone, literally the only thing I fear in there is some dumbass waltzing in front of my bloodied explosive .50
---
I don't have it. I threw some away hidden so they wouldn't come back for it and left the rest right where it was, since they left the server after.
---
I too have left the server already, sorry!
---
God, I wish more people did that. It’s so incredibly helpful to just have bodies taking a bit of aggro off you when you’re pelting the Queen. If they could remove at least half of the adds, even better. I’d happily keep rezing the lowbies if they would do this, and not hide in the barn. 
---
If you are going to wait for that, the game will end empty 
---
Defeating her despair is the real boss fight. 
---
Does it go away if you switch to 1st person? I didn't try that. I waited 15 minutes to see if it would go away like the last few times, but it never did
---
Says you
---
Is your account linked to your Bethesda account?
---
Good job mate!
---
No need to get all defensive mate, I’m just posting what I’ve seen. We’re all friends here 
---
Yes, it's the account I used for the PS4 version.
---
I do. But I'm quickly running out of ..purpose. Like, when you have a big bag of pistachios.....after about 15 minutes, you know you still like them, but that initial burst of enjoyment is quickly dissipating. 
---
so far the only new content seen, is that of the atom store  .....

https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019
---
Right before they start talking about fallout classic collection. 
---
Just download their launcher and it should be a free install from the library. Had the same thing happen for me.
---
Well then you'll be waiting forever. 
---
Here's a tip to Fallout fans.
---
Online games have Dupers. Always have. And no one has really been ever a letter to end it. 
---
15 years of Diablo 2 and they couldn't fix it. 
---
WoW... Always had duping methods. 
---
Expecting it to be fixed is unreasonable. Expecting new methods to be killed asap is not.
---
Agreed. I got a bit paranoid last night about similar to this. I must have spent about an hour and a half in game just working on my Camp. You know, improving it, building upwards, putting up pictures. Stuff like that. Towards the end it hit me, that if people are looking at my icon on the map, not moving elsewhere,and in the middle of no where, then they can pin point my Camp. 
---
I wish I knew who posted this but [op of this is the real mvp](http://imgur.com/9Rccgzd) 
---
The one with all the bowls that's just South of MorganTown and north of the golf place?
---
Thought this was r/monsterhunterworld for a second, real nutty shit there.
---
It finds you
---
That's what I did, but it's not showing up as free.
---
/u/ESOprudishArmor I COMPLETELY agree with you that having to pay a Console Subscription on **TOP** of the Ridiculous $60 price for this broken game is a Joke!
---
I can craft it if you're on pc
---
hmm. Ok. I understand that. I'll keep that in min as I keep progressing.
---
No power armor here, and my dr sits at 460-490 usually. Depending on my perks and health.
---
I'm pretty sure all he said was screen shot suspicious activity, and deal with the other players reaction accordingly. If you've got nothing to hide what's the problem here?

Thankyou! I was googling like a madman and couldnt find it! Thats awesome, thankyouuuuuuu.
---
I misread that as wig. 
---
I want a scorchbeast wig now.
---
I enjoyed it myself, more than I thought I would (to be honest I expected to get my ass whooped while the Lvl 40 got away), I don’t really do PvP in FO76, it definitely does need some polishing in my opinion, I usually just give aid to low levels to make them feel like part of the Fallout community but this felt even more impactful.
---
PS4, thank though
---
Me too. So far, since I've done most main missions on this playthrough, I'm just hunting for plans to have all the cool building things. But they're difficult to find - at least the ones you WANT.
---
post edited to include video

Just because someone has a lot of loot doesn't mean they're a duper. It's pretty hard to even determine who is and is not one with everything that's happening in the game right now. While I don't support dupers, I don't approve of witch hunting. I have read stories of people hunting dupers, and just because there was a level gap between two players, destroyed their camp, and accused them of being a duper. Dupers shouldn't be in this game, but people are taking it too far.
---
An additional suggestion, when selecting the nuke location include fissure site prime on the edge of the blast so that you can trigger the scorchbeast queen spawn and have a nice area where you don't need a hazmat suit or power armor.
---
Stop this witchhunt you damn moron.
---
I send team invites to level 20s and below teleport to their base, admire it, then install a fusion generator and crafting stations they don't have. 
---
It is unfortunate to see bases get destroyed especially when there is nothing to gain from it.
---
Yknow what... that makes sense. Fucking raiders, man. They suck but thats why they are called raiders. I wouldnt mind pvp being a but more balanced though... I could lose all day to a fair fight but when you get dropped in one single bullet by a guy in clothes while youre rocking power armor it really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Fuck
---
A thousand times this. 
---
I don't remember. I could try it out again later tonight 
---
My husband and I play together. I fell in love with Fallout because he always played Fallout 3 when we first started dating and I liked to watch. Now we have two kids so he gets in more play time than I do but he gave me 30 fusion cores yesterday because his stash was full so I don’t mind that much. He’s glad I never complain about him playing video games. 76 made our dream of playing together a reality :) 
---
I didn’t read your post but I have the answer based on your title: 
---
Relax in the shed and get back out there :)
---
/u/bernTOAST420 I agree with that... This  game still sucks and will always keep on sucking (Out of your money and intelligence)
---
Near the cliff to the south of Whitesprings Golf Course, there's a Bear with a cigar and a shotgun wearing a ranger hat
---
I don't think you know how this sub works. When people pull opinions out their ass, or assume things contrary to what Bethesda has actually said it goes like this ;
---
User A *Speculates wildly about anything in 76"
---
User B *Takes this speculation as Bible*
---
The next day ? OMG trade exploits! Loot crates! F2P!
---

There's a similar one near Berkeley Springs if you didn't know (2nd character is there)

And lots of space for that Razorgrain to grow. 
---
Not as quiet as the other place. Some toads and scorched pass by now and then. It gets REALLY dark at night though. 
---
I'm there trying to get those handmade plans.
---
Just find someone to look for the vendor with you. When found just have them sit on that sever and you just leave and rejoin till the vendor shows it. Refreshes its inventory every time you log on 
---
&lt;---- USA
---
Yes. Because new content is now expected in the first 2 months of a games launch?
---
I've [found it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/534514797874511893/unknown.png) a handful of times near the factory you go to get strangler blooms to make Radshield up on a ledge above the river so it's possibly a [respawn spot](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/534516262299107339/unknown.png).
---
I've had much better luck checking the white springs train station vendor than 
---
killing the mobs. Starting to wonder if its even worth the hassle to go to the resort with how laggy it is, then half the time someone is camped out back with missile turrets.
---
Inside the vault comes out once a week, I have the site bookmarked for easy access. It's nice for reference. 
---
I see you have 15 points in "lurking" lol.  Next you creep into someones camp like some wasteland Krampus, you should shoot flares at them and then hide.
---
Wow.   I just explored,  evented, and side quested until around lvl 70.  This is an adventure game, hopefully with added content and things in the future,  not meant to be shot straight through to end game.  I can only imagine how little of the game you have actually seen, main-lining straight to I Am Become Death.  Enjoy yourself don't worry so much about main quest line.  Jeez.
---
I finally got mine from defending the workshop next to the golf course in the toxic valley.  I never even saw them for sale anywhere.  Glad to have finally gotten them!
---
The enclave armory has a pretty good chance of having the plans. Afaik it's pretty much just a clean 1/3 split between gauss rifle, gatling laser, and gatling plasma. It can have one or two plans, so it's pretty likely to find a gatling laser
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/214
---
and well, the game does not have anything of final content, it would not be bad to overtake it 
---
Its a flop if the game is for sale for less than half full price 3 months after release....
---
At the Alpha Sute silo just before the command center theres a teddy with a full size marksman sniper rifle and a cigar in its mouth, I also believe a military beret, can not remember. 
---
That's another issue, you are not nearly a high enough level to have enough perks that benefit you in high level situations like this.
---
I remember FO4 having NPC's and a storyline.
---
For the scrounger perk you need to search the container (space, y, or triangle button). If it makes a sound and shows the icon the perk was successful but sometimes (depending on server lag) it can take a few seconds for the ammo to show up in the container and then you must loot it. When I first had the pharma farma I thought it auto looted and in my haste to loot areas I just assumed I was getting the extra meds until my wife (who takes her time looting) saw what I was doing and corrected me.
---
I'm sure if the authors could,'they would share it
---
Yea iv'e been using that going to the deposits in the mountainous region but no luck finding one in a cave.
---
Link? 
---
This here made me ask this. My base was made early when I was like level 8 or something.  It's not that big and not a lot of decorations like I see from the more detailed camps on the internet.  Would be nice if either the budge went up or decorations had their cost reduced by half.
---
It means the gun was pushed around or dropped, its there, but not on the body
---
Which vendor has it?
---
Where do you get cream 
---
No, they didn’t show up on the stats page. The removal process is random, so yeah good chance you’ll cure non bugged mutations before you got one of the bugged ones. Or maybe you’ll get lucky. In my case both speed demon and marsupial got bugged in that way so I had no choice but to start popping radaway.
---
I’ll actually play “Gimme shelter” by Rolling Stones when I go to fight the Scorchbeast queen with this weapon.
---
I’ve got one nearly the same as yours although with a different weapon trait and that it’s not modified. I didn’t pay much attention to it when I picked it up until I noticed it had explosive. Imagine my surprise :O
---
[https://pasteboard.co/HWtxT0v.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/HWtxT0v.jpg)
---
That’s the one
---
Your road check gave me idea. How about setting up tunnel on road with pressure plate in middle locking both ends of tunnel effectively locking him up (add switch inside incase player wander in). Garage doors might be best for his size. Only hope that he doesn't have way to teleport in case he is stuck.
---
I love people who act like it's easy to confuse a few friends hanging out at a camp with dupers. Duping behavior is recognizable, a duper's inventory is nothing like a player who acquired loot legitimately, and only people who have never tried hunting dupers cry about witch hunts like they know what they're talking about. I hope the next patch allows us to create little photo frames of screenshots to put on the walls so I can display all the duper bags I've looted and tossed in rivers. 
---
*Spoiler*  Holotape 2 is in Harper's Ferry next to a terminal by the second storage container gate. ( the one near John Brown's fort) 
---
It’s in the middle of town, a short run from the station. In the Grafton Day event area.
---
you mean 4:1 ratio
---
You don't actually seem to know much about software development.  This type of game? 
---
Didn't even exist in the era you describe.
---
You are also looking at the past with some serious rose colored glasses.
---
Level 95, been checking at least once daily, only seen it once. Didnt have enough fff
---
Ok I'll try there again, I didn't realise it was a random chance. Thanks!
---
Tone will change...maybe not in two weeks depending on how stubborn someone it, but eventually it'll change.  My best buddy took well over a month to finally admit it wasn't worth playing.
---
I don't remember 100% if this is a guaranteed spawn there, but there is a small Raider camp downhill from Huntersville. I'm fairly sure it's unmarked. There's a bunch of recipes there if I remember right. You'll pass some Brotherhood of Steel graves on your left on the way to it. I found one there.
---
Rng vendor that may spawn outside of Charleston train station. Load in run across the red bridge then back to the station. He may spawn by the shack and pond opposite side of the tracts to the station. Sometimes something else spawns. Random chance. If someone’s camp is there just try a different server.
---
I am way quicker to block people these days. I'm pushing 40, gotta start watching my salt intake, y'know?
---
While it is lame, the leave little to do at high level, so it's either farm for weapons and armor, make ridiculous camps, or grief people with the crappy pvp mechanic.
---
Also not everyone with tse weapons duped them, I dont dupe but I have a tse gatling gun that 1 shots anyone stupid enough to try and pvp with me, I usually run around with pacifist on because I dont like the pvp experience. 
---
So I’m not allowed to post speculations and opinions?, well damn you caught me comrade. 
---
Plans are completely random. You don't have to buy plans to get space for others, the same ones will appear again. I've seen the plan at watoga and Harper's ferry, but it's rare. Level is irrelevant for that plan.
---
Cool I have two, is it durable? Like could you wear it around cosplaying or even just while playing the game? Second, do you think it was worth it to buy? 
---
The witchunt continues
---
I feel you. Had 2 disconnects and a straight up game crash while playing for around 90mins.
---
awesome! thanks :D
---
What paint are you using?
---
More witchhunting...
---
I had lots of fun when doing pvp while I was making my way to lvl 50, but now that I'm 60 people don't seem to want to fight me, is not like I'm using 2 shot explosive, I'm just rocking a non legendary wearer revolver.
---
Also I don't really dislike fighting explosive weps, I love to find ways to counter the broken stuff on pvp, so fighting explosive is with a revolver is a fun challenge to me...
---
roflmao, I get it
---
It looks very cozy 😍 where did you get the brick plans from?
---
Mhm. Tried playing about 5 times. Each crashed within the span of 5 minutes.
---
i had the exact situation but i was buying a plan (that i found out i already owned \*sigh\*). i bought the plan and almost immediately when i left the terminal i DCd. it was a rollback, so i had the caps still so i bought the plan again \*sigh\*
---
If the Vaults are any indication, all that's coming in the known future is in the game already and just not accessible yet.  The Enclave Presidential Suite looks like it will have related missions/quests in order to earn the presidential items.  The three sealed vaults each have some sort of group mission that all follow the same basic structure, but so far they look like they'll be similar to the Powering Up events.  Fix these things within the time, run around and find missing parts, etc.  One vault looks like it'll be fixing environmental systems, another is full of monsters, and the other has had a GECK explode back into it and I'm honestly not sure what mission they intend for that space.
---
Yea there will always be a way to exploit a game.
---
But almost all highly acclaimed  games have a very strict and severe punishment for cheating aaand a good way of immediately locating people cheating.
---
Interesting.
---
Allen! 
---
How is it surprising that people have fun? [gotta take this game real serious](https://giphy.com/gifs/26n6WRlbdHiCb4xb2?utm_source=media-link&amp;utm_medium=landing&amp;utm_campaign=Media%20Links&amp;utm_term=https://amp-reddit-com.cdn.ampproject.org/)
---
They do have battery issues it seems.
---
I got mine at the watoga vendor
---
Thanks!! I think I got them from Grahm
---
Could be a coincidence, but all 3 times I spawned him, there was a blast zone at the scorch queen.  GL finding him.  Also multiple people server hopping in party increases your odds so team up.
---
Go test it yourself. You’ll see the difference it makes. 
---
Containers are instanced to your character so they are only empty if you recently looted them or the server is lagging and hasn't loaded the loot yet.
---
Ugh I think I just have shit luck lol can’t manage to find them. 
---
Cream?! Where?
---
My party of four have a horrendous time trying to party up in the main menu. (PS4) Sitting in the same room we can see each other online but it will constantly tell us our friends (who are online) are not online while people who we know are not online are? And it gives us an option to join their server. 
---
It was on ps4?? That guy might be me lol
---
Free on PC.
---
You're not trying to download it on PS4, are you?
---
Got one from Monongah Power last night 
---
I know that you get X-01 armor from the Enclave but I don’t know how because I’m now on I am Become Death and I still can’t find it
---
I would have said this game is remarkably stable if I ignored this last week.  No idea what the hell they broke but supposedly consoles haven't even been patched yet!
---
There’s also my guilty pleasure song... but I dare not reveal it. It’s humiliating especially for a grown man.
---
Oh people can have fun, doesn't change how immature something is 
---
I would say the changes that take the least amount of effort and maximize the benefits are the best changes, regardless of additive or reductive. But that's more of a developer perspective. :P
---
I would also add this opinion: lowering one thing seems a lot smarter than raising a lot of other things, which can have unintended consequences later. If you're dealing with a delicate balance, it's best not to upset it by messing around with too many parts at once. Keep it simple, clean, and effective.
---
Beyond that...
---
1. I think TSEs should be nerfed rather than buffing a lot of other weapons. It's simpler and more efficient, as per my personal philosophy. If people are using TSEs because they're indisputably better for combat outcomes as you say, then they should be happy when the type is nerfed and other choices present themselves as equals again.
---
2.  I have no problem with players doing the Whitesprings grind. Mainly because I don't do it. I have no interest in it. It sounds boring and I wonder why anyone would want to sit in one location and grind the same mobs over and over-- especially since I think Whitesprings is one of the ugliest and most out of place locations in the game.  I'm just gonna continue exploring the world and not treating this game like it's a competitive MMO race for levels so everyone else can grind what they like IMO. xD
---
3. Mutations seem rather dicked-up to me. I barely pay attention to them. I don't think Bethesda really tried to balance them in any way or even think much about them beyond 'let's do some cool wasteland mutations shit'. I do like some of your ideas re: having them interact with each other or gear. Sounds neat. Aside from that, I don't chase them or purposefully try to cure them, they just come and go for me as part of the natural course of my life on toxic earth. Once mods (or maybe even some kind of hardmode from Bethesda) are released, then I might start to care more about mutation balance and calls for nerfs.  
---
Ketchup. Not what you were looking for? Why don’t you just test it yourself and then when I’m proved right you can go and say so. 
---
Cherish that gauss rifle, I accidentally  scrapped mine, and I’m still sad :( 
---
I’ve rebuilt it except for the suppressor,  it now I dream of an unscrapable legendary version ;) 
---
I get the same problem
---
Xbox1?
---
Tried to message u on psn won’t let me
---
Tomorrow 9am est
---
I think anyone who has played the game legit and is at level 70+, could take a peek at anyone's inventory and take a fairly educated and accurate guess as to if the player is duping or not. I've seen people who I'm positive were duping. I just give them a thumbs down and carry on. 
---
Nope. I'm looking on the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher
---
one of the many oversights on the half-baked launcher they've shoehorned us PC players into...
---
Is there a good reason (aside from paint) to use anything lower than my X-01?  I'm asking because I want there to be. 
---
I love you (always forever)?
---
Yeah I know that one. My base is actually closeby. I didn’t like this spot because water and junk are on different levels and it doesn’t suit my build style. 
---
I also tried this, the bot explodes …………I'm just going crazy at this point.
---
I can never get the fences to work properly they don’t connect to each other or anything else 
---
Ok. I heard it was today
---
I’m lunygunz on psn
---
For me it's been since just before Xmas and got steadily worse. I have no idea what it is but I hope it gets sorted soon. It's the blue screen error codes that are the worst
---
They delayed it. So it's tomorrow
---
Lmao chill yeye smoke some weed 
---
They cant, just look at Epic and Fortnite. Tons of auctions for StW guns on ebay. I think Epic combats it by continually releasing newer, slightly better weapons over time. 
---
Dang. So, just keep checking?? I'm taking it easy, so, I don't mind just wandering around until I find it. 
---
Yes. Fight the good fight!! 
---
Holy shit! It squished him like a bug!
---
I feel like I'm missing something...
---
I get that they *usually* don't lose caps by "bounty-trading" with friends.  Also griefing, for some people anyway, is it's own reward.  Internet trolls get their jollies just by pissing people off.
---
But it seems to me that the risk is not near the reward.   Eventually they will mess up resulting in a loss of 2k caps to a smart player biding his time &amp; head-shotting one of the griefers.  How do they recoup this loss?
---
So...what am I missing?  Do they get caps from players who fight back?  Doesn't seem like this is enough to stay net positive to me.  Then eventually they will run out of caps.
---
Same here, I have every one I've found since beta in my stash lol. Quite a few too since I had the bobblehead locating perk equipped for a while.
---
Haven't needed them in game but I figure I might at some point. 
---
Agreed. I'm waiting for the day they give us text chat.
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
     PC (brothers comp, no idea)  and rpobably anyone
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
DoomfarerCDN
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.) While rebuilding my brothers camp, all the mods he had struggled to buy to mod his X-01 suits from the Enclave, got swallowed up and used. Un-beknownst to him 
---
or myself, we didn't know that for some reason you guys linked the mods section to the junk section.
---
Why would you do this? The mods section should only be scrapped from the stash if the player actually wants to? Right? wouldn't that make more sense? If someone wants to sacrifice a mod to build a Turret or whatever. Then they should have to go through the same steps to scrap at a work bench. Otherwise you're just breaking peoples minds, can you please disconnect this 'feature'.
---
It's not helpful in the least.
---
While writing the original statement, I've decided my next escapade is going to involve sneaking into someone's locked camp, use my chameleon armor and stand right behind them until they turn around.   I use MicMute, so I may keep my mic muted and then as they start to move I'll cough really loud.  When they can barely see me and realize that there is someone 95% invisible in front of them, that should give them the shivers.   Maybe my opening line will be,  "Whatcha doing?"   Maybe if they give me a funny response, like "Shitting my pants! What are YOU doing?" I'll drop them some stimpaks and leave.   Otherwise, maybe I'll just unsneak and go lay down in their bed.  ;p
---
The big oof
---
Truth. I use a TSE but swap out to tag legendaries in any event I'm in that has other players. Sure, they don't have to and all that junk, but every is just trying to play and have fun.
---
ya thats one of the reasons i like that place, server hopping to find an unowned (and powered up) steel yard yields great steel in itself.
---
This reported this issue before. For 1000 atoms i would like it to remain in place lol.
---
I’ve never been able to find a fat man to fire the 3 minis I have...but if I had 21 I’d scour the world to find one just to rain down holy radioactive terror on all my enemies!!!!
---
Yeah if the bot touches the water he dies. Have your second talking to the bot till you return. He doesn’t move if someone is looking at his inventory.
---
I have a huge problem with Bobbleheads and plans. I have planned to use all my correlating bobbleheads when I do end game, though. And give away my plans. I need the room. 😭
---
Did anyone even read my post? I clearly state don't just attack if they have good loot. I'm talking 75 TSE handmades. Not a few 3 stars.
---
A level 1 scorched 🤣🤣🤣 I had to do my best not to laugh out loud...
---
*or maybe you've uncovered a secret*
---
Damn. He is a mod in a trading subreddit?
---
It's a video game, you dumb mother fucker. Put the controller and walk away before you have a stroke. 
---
haha glad you liked it, and I completely Agree with your thoughts about the datamined paint job! 
---
Nice find! Always a good idea to inspect every legendary drop to see what its got on it.
---
Maybe we can make our own group then as i consider myself a raider (I raid places and collect obscurities), but im really into helping others. I tend to drop and give my extra goodies, but ive also been looking for a reliable source to dump at (like a player vendor) for some sort of "loyalty" in return. Having to rely on the trader to have currency is not what im looking to do, id prefer to supply the needs of the vendor in exchange for higher discounts/occasional free item (thinking plans more than some crazy 3 star), something along those lines. 
---
I did!
---
Sorry, you won't see any sympathy for exploiters coming from me.
---
Vendors don’t care where the caps come from as long as they get them 🤣
---
imagine? That'd be pretty sick.
---
Go smoke bro 
---
Afraid?
---
Still need to repair stuff ;)
---
Pigfoot-SM behemoth
---
Ethel will be the first living NPC we'll meet
---
The Sgt Gutsy’s still give me problems @ lvl 85. 
---
Speak for yourself, I could give a fuck about Legendaries. I play the game for fun. Not to satisfy some OCD. 
---
Xbox One, thanks though!
---
Are you certain? I seem to recall finding a bag of caps specifically and it had 0 actual value. It’s been like 18-24 months since I played so I could be mistaken
---
Basically keep checking by server hopping. Or, ask here on reddit on one of the markets for fallout 76. 100% chance of someone having it.
---
Last night, a level 17 person walked up to my camp and started trying to go in my house. I was very proud of my house, so I excitedly let them in and they retrieved some stuff from a stash box. Then they called in an orbital strike on my house and destroyed it as they walked out.
---
That made me sad.
---
Lol welcome to building in fallout
---
Not if you consider that they have said they are keeping the servers up indefinitely. That can't be done with game sales alone and is done through in game atom store purchases in the long run. 
---
Since the atom store is their long term revenue plan, lowering price of the game now that they've already made a profit actually makes perfect business sense to maximize in game revenue by having more people play it.
---
Your economic strategy needs some perks I think ;)
---
I saw one when escaping a Scorchbeast once near its Fissure and seems the purple is a DoT style debuff that damages enemies over time, it killed alot of Scorched with it and even hurt the Scorchbeast making it retreat, they're easy to damage but they can hurt badly if you don't act fast, melee seems to not be the best due to teleporting.
---
That's one thing I was thinking about yesterday when I was reading a complain about FO76. They were like "the game is bad because Fallout is supposed to be a single player game and they made it multiplayer" and all I could think was "you must not like PSO then huh?"
---
Yeah. That minigun always turned out to be a pipe rifle
---
Next question?
---
Me and my brother were messing around at that agility obstacle course when we both get a friend request from a random. Turns out it was from a level 10 who was exploring the town nearby. I wasnt sure what to make of it (figured maybe just an enthusiastic new player trying to make friends). Within a couple of minutes i spot his name on the map, and his blip was moving towards us.
---
He meets us on a cliffside and we wave. I notice hes less than halfway to death so i drop some stimpacks and some water for him.
---
Turns out he was new to the game and had all these questions for me. I spent an unexpected hour or so showing him around and helping him get acquainted with the game mechanics. Crafted him a leather chestpiece and some weapons.
---
Wholetime, his kids were yellin and playin in the background of his mic.
---
It was fun. Something about helpin out others in this game is just so rewarding.
---
I didn't work. Still says I don't have the holotape, sadly.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Damn, that really does suck. I understand your frustration.
---
You going to be on soon? 
---
minimum level for minigun is 35, so likely they're dropping for you now. Same happened to me
---
Fuck people trying to play the game and check it out and get some XP, right?!? /s
---
Big whoop. A couple people. Not like all the 100+ are doing much against the Queen at times. Is it purely level-based for you? Or will you check everyone’s weapon upon arrival in the Nuke Zone? Just seems like an interesting annoyance. 
---
You're better off buying it off another player on the market sub reddit. It will cost you way less than half 
---
This is one dumb fucker right here
---
It can be that way again with psychobuff!
---
I’m so proud of you honestly 
---
Excellent! I’m only missing the ones I did during B.E.T.A. Unfortunately that’s the whole main quest up to the Enclave(DMV again RIP) and do the reviving(funny how it was so needed when my wife and I were noobs and now it’s not).
---
Can I have your stuff? For real tho man, gotta try to chill and not get so frustrated over it. Rub one out, blow off some steam and try again or just move on. Surely there are games that dont piss you off.
---
Probably.
---
Why people bother playing a game their just going to cheat their way threw is beyond me, but it seems popular. 
---
As much as I hate raining on people’s parade in groups. 
---
These assholes are crashing entire servers so they can dupe.
---
Get them banned.
---
Any form of exploit should be met with consequences.
---
From a Bethesda employee. 
---
Honestly I’ll be hunting for them
---
If a player refuses to trade with me that I suspect of duping they will be met with immediate Gatling fire.
---
Because killing other players is actually aloud in the game. 
---
Now harassing them and hopping servers is not aloud.
---
Red means control from what i've gathered and purple means debuff, seems to red up machines and purple up organics mostly.

Wow.  Gee.  Thanks internet stranger, for that eye opening revelation. /s
---
You think I didn't think that myself?  Where do you think that realization comes from?  Do you think the only game I ever played was 76?  Do you think that if I have played other games that I may actually play them along side of 76?
---
Here's a clue, since a smarmy asshole like yourself can't seem to catch one on your own.  That thought is in direct relation to being DC'd, playing another game and then realizing; 76 just isn't that unique or even well done for it's genre to ever reallyy overcome for a lot of people.
---
Those people will express there opinions as will those that like it.  The only difference between my original post and this one, is that some simple fuckhead thought they could add weight to their baseless claim by being a dickbag towards someone they disagreed with.
---
Had you even bother with a modicum of civility, well this post would be different; but you're a common fucktard not worthy of a respectful reply.
---
That's... Kind of insane, actually. 
---
Try and see if the mod shows up when trying to modify a different set like the excavator. Had this happen to me and is the only way I found them.
---
Relax before you have a stroke buddy trust me we all understand the fustrationd of the game. Just hoping 2019 is a good yeat for 76 patch wise. Lately the crashes have been pushing my limits. But i still love the game i just want to be able to play the game.
---
Dude. If you take yourself that seriously, I really pity you. That must be a depressing life. 
---
Thanks boo xD
---
I'm not trying to start a witch hunt without confirmation. I'm a big fan of innocent until *proven* guilty, emphasis on proven. 
---
It's at the point that dupers aren't only figuratively ruining the game, but literally crashing the servers. It's stress on players, stress on bugthesda's staff and preventing immersion
---
The only people I can see being ok with this are the dupers that don't give a funpop. 
---
Who is whinier, the bitch or the bitch who whines about him
---
You appear to have Nerd Rage maxed out irl
---
I love you too.
---
I thought they fixed that in the last patch?
---
Now I’m gonna be paranoid every time I get a random invite 😂 so far I haven’t had terrible experiences with other players, although last night a guy wanted to trade but I said no and then he immediately began attacking me...
---
Explosive damage is the only thing that can hurt me in PA. I'm grinding out Fireproof so after the patch even that won't hurt. It would take like 4 yao guai pinballing me to kill me.
---
I like your idea. Its not extreme or aggressive just a hey of you see something fishy, check it out and if it proves to be something, then report it. You even advised caution against reporting people who may have acquired their goods legitimately. Which makes me wonder why everyone is freaking out. The best is someone calling the idea toxic, apparently their definition of toxic is different then mine.
---
Just a psa guys fat man's are great for fissure prime especially if you got a mirv on it, does amazingly well. 
---
Thanks, Dupbama

I've gotten t51 plans and mod plans from the distant thunder event. Also see them on watoga/harpers ferry vendors
---
I've generally noticed people being cool about this at Uranium Fever, but Whitesprings is an entirely different story...
---
Not that event in particular, but at Emmett there was a Legendary and I swung once and it died. There was another person there in another room. I was going to hit it and bring it to share, but it just died. I didn't even have any damage perks equipped except Bloody Mess. I wouldn't intentionally try to steal someones opportunity for loot. It dropped a nice item that I would have actually wanted to keep, but I went and dropped it in a bag for the other person because I denied them a chance for loot. It was a Berserker knuckles with double power attack damage or something like that. I would have really liked that one too. 
---
Does not matter ima be buying three copies of the collector's edition 
---
Yes, but now it takes crashing the entire server to dupe
---
Damn, I can’t even get through the post. Seriously though, this is the type of stuff people have been shitting on the game for. The complaints are numerous and fair. Just step away and come back in a month or two. Don’t uninstall or trade it in. Just give it a rest for a while. 
---
it explodes even if it does not touch the water for me.I do not know what to say
---
While I was aware it can’t crash everybody in order to work, I’m convinced it often goes wrong and does crash it for everybody.
---
Too manu times I’ve had very good performance only to suddenly see either “server has crashed” or “you were disconnected from server” out of the boue with no drops or issues prior.
---
Nuked Whitesprings is still a good legendary farm location regardless.  Otherwise Uranium Fever event and all the "Horde" events are good for legendary mobs.
---
Maybe those players are getting stuck at spawn points since the server is not responding
---
In the US, crashing constantly.
---
It seems your desire for a perfectly constructed base is not matched by your desire for a perfectly constructed paragraph. Or any paragraph.

mg turrets = 10% camp budget   
---
all other turrets = 12% camp budget  
---
only rocket turrets do anything meaningful, and by meaningful they cripple body parts, and have ok damage. And you need an MG turret to work as a spotter for the rocket turrets, because the MG turrets have good target acquisition and rocket turrets bad target acquisition
---
Fairly new and 47!? Holy moly... you flying through levels as a fairly new level 47 lol
---
The same problem after update. Can't craft a lever rifle from my plan. 
---
That toxic masculinity.
---
I found one, pulled it out to see how it shot, blew through 2800 cells. Whelp, never again assaultron head.  
---
I’m already borderline suicidal in real life. So I’m fine with passing my time each day and getting my mind off shit by playing a game. But I’ve never played anything in my life that was so good at pushing me three steps back for one step forward. I’ve spent hours of my life now with no progress digital or literal. So yes I’m stupid. But then again I don’t care. I’m gonna die eventually anyway. I’d just like to have spent $60 to have fun instead of this trash heap
---
Yeah, it’s really hard to do. I find the easiest way to do it is place the first piece on the lowest part of the ground, then connect another piece (let’s say this is a corner) and have it go on the highest part of the ground. It sort of makes it to where that piece actually goes INTO the ground. Not necessarily what you want, but it looks better than an incomplete fence. I hope that makes sense. 
---
This is a Bethesda game still in its infancy, you may want to take a break and come back in a year.  Checkout reddit/forums of any other Bethesda game around its release and it is the exact same routine.  Only unique thing is multiplayer was added.
---
If you try to gut it out, then expect the same painful process and darkness. It takes a year+ for them to stablalize the game.  Then another 6 months to get their scrap in gear for mods.  After which the games start getting good.
---
To stick around is just to learn the ins and outs for when the game gets interesting.  Any effort that requires a wall of anguished text is a waste of time.
---
I didn't cre that much before but crashing an entire server deserves a ban from all future titles. Lol. 
---
That is a good place for farming legendaries still. They nerfed the experience you were getting from bloated glowing ghouls, not the legendary rate. Check the vendor weapons tab at the train station in white springs too. I've bought some very decent legendaries off him.
---
&gt; YOURE NOT MY MOMMY
---
Remember that consoles don't have the patch that supposedly fixed the OTHER duping method... so they'd still be subject to that.
---
My issue is that it seems it is not even paint. It just seems like *actual* armor it would give you. If it was paint I can buy the general non professional look. But it should look like the quality that the prototype paintjob looks for the X0-1 aka fresh off the line. Tbh kinda glad it isn't star sprangled out because I don't think Enclave know any other outfit and armor colors that isn't a shade or a variation of drab. 
---
Duping got patched. We have no evidence of any new dupes existing except for vague, contradictory stories from a couple random people that I'm 99% sure are completely made up. None of the glitching youtubers or other sources have mentioned anything about a new dupe method. The game's always had unstable servers, this is nothing new. As for people standing together, there are a ton of possible explanations - friends playing together, a squad trying to do some raids for resources etc, people launching a nuke at a silo, people farming some legendary spot, or maybe somebody just has a really nice camp and everybody nearby stopped by to look at it. You guys really have to stop being so goddamn paranoid and screaming dupe at everything you see
---
PS4. I disconnected 3 times in 30 minutes.  Unplayable.
---
So is the client crashing ten minutes after you launch a nuke a known issue that they are fixing? Or is it only me? It happens to me virtually every time. And I can't just hang out with friends all the time either, particularly in the morning.
---
Same old story, Ricks killing Mortys...
---
Whitesprings also has a lot of bags of fertilizer to supplement your acid collection.
