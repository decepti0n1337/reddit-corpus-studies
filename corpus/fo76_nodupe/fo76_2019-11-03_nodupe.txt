Should we replace it with "insert well known Todd Howard comment here"

But then again that's a lot of typing.
---
I have a bloodied weightless Super Sledge that I call "The Cooler All Rise"
---
CoD and Battlefield also have map packs. That's something FO76 hasn't done. They have weapon packs and skin packs.
---
Fortnite also locks a lot of stuff behind a season pass that most people never actually unlock, and even if you do a lot of it is still stuck behind that padd.
---
Borderlands also has the keys that you can buy to roll weapons.
---
Charging money is charging money. You can't differentiate when it suits you, just to prove a point.
---
FO76 hasn't done ANYTHING as bad as what you're claiming. You're being very melodramatic and unrealistic, to the point of dishonesty. Just stop it. Nothing is nearly as bad as you've made it out to be, they aren't doing anything any differently than any other company with a game that needs to maintain an income to stay going.
---
I came across a double explosive gat laser in a vending machine, didn‚Äôt realize it was very rare so i didn‚Äôt buy it ü§Æ
---
Because we care about Fallout and everything it stands for enough to see how much of a disgrace to the franchise FO76 is.
---
Not speaking up will kill what Fallout used to be with people around who think Fallout is where it's supposed to be.

It's 40 atoms for 3 Halloween-related parts to that weekly challenge. If you do the Monster Mash event in Watoga you should easily get 50+ halloween candy in the 1st round.

Couple left, if you're on now add me GT: bratpack911 and come find me üòÅ
---
On the Market discord someone is working on it.
---
Good shout, didn't think of that! I'll do that with future cores
---
I tried that a few times, I think I just scared people! üò¨
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Neither of us have metrics, and yet all the games you mentioned have 0 need to resort to these garbage practices to pay for themselves and sequels.
---
It's not a weapon but I named my Excavator PA "Stretchy Pants"
---
I should of posted it on the 29th when I first saw!
---
Nah they take waaaaaaay too long to build and materials are pretty pricey.
---
I spend more than that a day on coffee. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Honestly if $13 would make you or break you, you should probably replace game time with a second job.

I equip aqua boy in the new map and jump in the lake. Nobody can see me beneath the murky water and i just wait at the bottom till the storm blows over me and i die or i became the victor.
---
Freaking sweet. And we need that the subreddit has been too salty lately.
---
People are obviously buying fallout 1st.  I'm not saying any of this is right. But obviously bethesda is making cash
---
I was referring to the person I was replying to but okie dokie artichokie.
---
Just doing my part :)
---
If you wanna trade the long suit I'll definitely trade you and even throw in a Grim Reaper Vault boy cutout.
---
I got a refund for my Backwoods Bungalow because of how much of an ass it is to place it down on flat land, plus it's budget rate was way too much for something that you can hardly place shit in. Needless to say I was grateful for the rep actually tending to my needs, as much as we like to shit on Bethesda, the dude who helped me was very nice and understanding.
---
I agree
---
I always put stuff in there.
---
It looks awesome!!
---
WHAT garbage practices? They aren't doing anything different than any other company. Everyone is just throwing a fit because:
---
A) You weren't given all the same things in the sub for free (tough shit, mow a lawn once a month, it's $13)
---
B) there really isn't another reason I can think of. You guys are just acting ridiculously entitled, and you look like idiots on here, going on about how screwed everyone is. There is literally 0 reason for you to be this upset.
---
If you want what's in the subscription so badly, then go buy it. It's only $13.
---
At least buy now everyone should know about it.
---
It has been nerfed twice, it helps but won't save you alone!
---
Hence the word "also" in the sentence.
---
Preach on, brother!
---
Thanks!
---
I sell all ammo @1 cap, dog food @10, diluted stims @5, normal stims @10, supers @15, all magazines, and bobbles @50, maps @15, and all plans/recipes @10, and they sell like hotcakes. Also I sell junk toys of all sorts @25.
---
They're awesome for plan and mod farming. Most of the mods I learned were from scrapping treasure map guns and weapons. There's also a ton of plans in them holes along with a lot of junk.
---
I regret getting a month to try out. Its just terrible. All my scrao disappeared. Even though they "fixed it" i never got my junk back. And we all know how well they fix things *cough*still haven't killed my umpteenth sb queen to get the Kill Huge Creatures challenge*cough* so yeah....i regret it
---
You will get a very divided answer, personally I say yes it's wonderful
---
If you want to try it without paying the full price you can usually find a pretty good deal on eBay :)
---
Other than stims, I've actually seen a massive decline in chem sales. They do sell, but it takes half a century to sell them.
---
what should i sell pure water at?
---
F
---
Holy damn, you're a true hero. Amazing work.
---
As long as i get to keep my dollars and boomsticks i don‚Äôt care what they call the train.
---
I'm running life giver, ironclad, frog legs, tank killer, master commando, tenderizer, and bloody mess. I sometimes swap frog legs out for marathoner or bodyguards.
---
Well , at least you know what you want.
---
Pretend your a rabbit and hide in the bushes. You get more XP for just surviving than for killing other players.
---
Nah. I'm an avid camp builder, and that's not really a great idea. I hate to be that guy, but stuff like that is what fallout 4 is for. You can't just have enemies stop spawning for everyone because you want a swanky pad.
---
Check your stash
---
This is a Bethesda problem, not a player one. Ask Bethesda to fix it, not the players to do a workaround that they shouldn't have to.
---
Thanks
---
Yes it's a shitpile at this point
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I have 11 bobble heads you can buy for 800 caps (total)
---
Thank you! I try. :)
---
You don't even have to buy it, go on YouTube and check the gameplay out and if it's good,  play it.
---
Never heard of a spawn Inside a house.
---
Any other similar game has an initial cost, and then other things to pay for after to help keep revenue going. FO76 is unique in most regards, but if you look at WoW, or Guild Wars, or Everquest even, nothing that FO76 has done is out of the ordinary.
---
Every time I see these hate posts, it always boils down to one thing; jealousy. Everyone that's mad is just so damned ENVIOUS of what's in the subscription, but for some reason this time it should be different. You think you shouldn't have to pay for it, because you already bought the base game. I wonder how you guys thought this game was going to manage to stay online longer than a year without any more revenue coming in. Especially considering it lost Zenimax 10s of millions of dollars at launch.
---
Stop being greedy and entitled. Get over yourselves. You want unlimited scrap storage? Private instances? Go buy the damned subscription. Otherwise just shut up already. This is worse than telling a 3 year old he has to share the swing set.
---
The game had a rough start. But I still love it. It's much better now than before. They are constantly making new content too. It's worth it.
---
It's true: after you shoot the Yao Guai you will find spare carry weight for half the meat.
---
Why do you care if people are playing it? Just go mind your own business
---
Ive encountered it a lot lately!
---
The game has been fun but flawed since launch. Unfortunately, Bethesda‚Äôs increasingly predatory monetization strategies have forced me to stop recommending it to friends.
---
SWTOR still has a subscription.
---
What kind of PA. If it's not in your stash I can craft you Ultracite or Excavator. Just give me some time to farm steel I used what I had crafting ammo. I can also craft some of the mods but I may need flux.
---
Right? He'll be back.
---
The subscription is voluntary. These same 20 angry people that keep posting are such drama queens.
---
ah, you've found the portal to the endgame. i'd be more secretive of this if i were you.
---
Dannnger zoooone
---
Everyone knows that.
---
What those subscribers should know, however, is they're also paying for **another** Fallout 76.
---
What's stopping Bethesda from not doing it if it's still profitable **despite everything**?
---
It should be obvious by now why there's people like me who speak up against it.
---
If you **expect** the same content, like all the singleplayers then i give you a definitely NO. If you want to experience a falloutiesque gameplay in a fallout word then yeah try it out.
---
However if you can ignore that first fact, the main story that is build up like a scavenger hunt could maybe interest you. Or maybe you will stick with the fallout 4 "improved" base building all day long, but if you expect exiting content in the endgame that will last forever, you really should stick to other mmos.
---
btw: dont buy fallout 1st
---
I did say "if implemented correctly." And its been less than a month since they've been getting their consistent income stream. 
---
ESO is not 'F2P' either, so maybe I should have worded that differently. Yet, they have a similar subscription model. It took them a year or so for them to get the content right for both groups. 
---
What I'm saying is, don't get the sub of you don't want it. Maybe put the game down for a year. Then, come back, see what kind of content was added. Have a little patience for an overworked dev team who is fed constant discouragement for practices they have no control over. If it's not up to your standards, then so be it, no one is forcing you to keep playing.
---
That's really weird. Will it let you pass through? This was in Welch.
---
Maybe replace that coffee with a little less entitlement. Just because adulting is hard and bills suck, doesn't mean someone can't unwind on a game. Some people have full time jobs and still struggle, so stuff your judgment of the OP, and get over yourself.
---
But the outerworlds is a totally different game... I just try and appreciate this for what it is, a multiplayer online spinoff. It‚Äôs not going g to be around forever. I didn‚Äôt buy 1st personally (but know many who did). Doesn‚Äôt really bother me.
---
I literally REFUSE to give anyone the time of day if they‚Äôre upset about something that‚Äôs optional. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt buy it.
---
Upgrading to a new expansion i pretty costly, but we had to pay 60-200 for the game too
---
When I avoid resource nodes and stay away from random spawn locations, nothing spawns to attack other than maybe once a week. My current spot always gets attacked but that‚Äôs why I put it there and set my defenses up the way that they are.
---
He actually never said that part. Go read the actual transcript of the interview and stop listening to what other people tell you.
---
Yeah but I accidentally pull it out all the time then  all I have to do is accidentally press x one of those times
---
#HumanityFirst
---
Or you can stop shitting all over people who don't want to pay a monthly subscription for Bethesda to address issues with this game we've been complaining about for months, that they said they were listening to and working on, when Bethesda led us to believe there wouldn't be a subscription to this game but only free updates and moneyed cosmetics (via the atom store).
---
Because it‚Äôs a mod for T-45 power armor, not for excavator armor
---
It did not! Its just a huge wall and everything starts to lag really bad, that or i fall out of the world.
---
People usually say suitcases. I think the cash registers are more obvious and easier to come by accident.
---
Ps4
---
I guess. There‚Äôs such a delay though it would be hard, plus‚Äôs the audio clues.
---
They might see fit to delete your account on their platform, denying you access to your library on their platform.
---
Oh. So you'll be back in 25-30 hours once you run out of stuff to do in Outer Worlds (for another $60 I might add).
---
Then, you can come back, and still play FO76 the EXACT SAME WAY that you used to  because the subscription is optional and doesn't change anything for players who chose not to get it.
---
Because it only works on t45 armor. It's like fitting a square in a triangle hole.
---
Cool story bro
---
They‚Äôre watching the sub for new things to charge us for, because apparently they‚Äôre incapable of coming up with ideas on their own‚Äîso maybe you‚Äôll get your wish.
---
That‚Äôs fair I‚Äôm just paranoid I guess
---
None of these are a fix to an intentionally busted mechanic made intentionally annoying, that alone should be enough of a reason.
---
Also it doesn't mean I agree with weapon packs that have different stats, if that's what they are.
---
Fortnite season pass has nothing that includes gameplay variants.
---
For Borderlands I guess you mean the Golden Keys, which are handed out for free when redeeming codes that Gearbox tells through twitter and such, and they come with DLC purchases, also, they don't grant exclusive items.
---
And it is very much a different situation, there is a clear difference between selling a map that had hours of work put into it via mappers, modellers, texture artists &amp; sound designers as opposed to selling a fix for a mechanic of the game that is intentionally made to be limiting, to top it all they previously said the limit was in place specifically for server stability.
---
No one's gonna be overworking them into making an FO76 if there aren't people that make it profitable.
---
Same here tried Outer World's and it a good game, just not a FO replacement.
---
Some people might be doing that because they focus on selling other things. I sell plans all the time but to get people to come by for just plans is near impossible. So I am guilty of over priced on weight reduction legendaries but make up for it in rare plans, mods, ammo and aid. I hate the ones that just have complete crap that you can find anywhere and have virtually nothing of value but even at that, over price it. Like 2k for a normal level 50 hazmat suit or a preachers outfit.
---
Refer to my other message I sent you, there is a clear difference between selling a map that had hours of work put into it via mappers, modellers, texture artists &amp; sound designers as opposed to selling a fix for a mechanic of the game that is intentionally made to be limiting, to top it all they previously said the limit was in place specifically for server stability.
---
The only accurate statement you made there was the cosmetic only. I'll give you that little victory. Otherwise, everyone really, really lives to misquote others to prove a point.
---
No, they'll just overwork them on another project. These are their jobs, after all...
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross
---
i named my bloodied power attack meat hook toothpick. cause im a little edgelord.
---
Buddy of mine paid the 100 bucks and his reasoning makes sense...He was going to buy Atoms every month anyway so he is saving money and freeing up his stash box. Win Win for him...I would pay it also but my wife would flip her shit.
---
You are right, I don't play xbox, I see you said xbox one, which is much newer than windows 7.
---
My friends and I are noticing the same thing. Getting destroyed in the Halloween event and I never used to bat an eye at those robots. Same for super mutants.
---
But why ? That's a lot of weight for the same gun.
---
I would say an extra 20 bucks is nearly the same as the subscription especially when you're talking prices north of 100$.
---
Also, the tricentenial edition wasn't 120$ in AU, it was anywhere between 130 and 150$ https://xbdeals.net/au-store/game/353069/fallout-76-tricentennial-edition-preorder
---
My vanguards is jacked up too, I was up to about 500somethin and now I'm down to 380 max :/ i just assumed the nerfed it.
---
Yep no problem - I'm curious to see if they stored my progress on the server too, because if not I'll be starting from scratch I guess.  Good to hear you can get up to 90 without blue screen of doom though.  If you wait a hours / days it might even just start working again. (No idea what actually causes it)
---
If only they were actually private.
---
Have gotten dense plans, power armor plans (raider, T45, T51, T60). This is normally what I farm then for.
---
It‚Äôs considered excavator if you want mods for it go to the vender at Camden park
---
Has to be a full on bug. When equip/unequip all the armor peices none of my stats change. Must be specific perks because chameleon armor works.
---
I adore building camps in unmarked locations and using an unnecessary amount of decorations and employing weird building bugs. I hate having to do lots of repairs. But to me, this is part of the challenge of choosing the best locations. 
---
Exa: One of my camps was partly in a monorail car. Occasionally other players would unintentionally drag a scorchbeast over and it would blast away. For some reason it didn't seem able to destroy items inside the monorail.
---
Existing structures in general often seem less permeable than buildable camp walls (building in houses, cabins, etc.) 
---
Other examples: I put my crops in tents because they seem more durable than most wall types &amp; consume less resources &amp; often fit better into the world. Generators and resource collectors inside walls inside the house. 
---
Also, home defense level 3 does help, esp. if you put the turrets high up in the air.
---
Two easy ways to get ammo.
---
1) go to Lucky Hole Mine in Excavator PA and farm a ton of lead. Go to Westek and kill a ton of supermutants (apply scrapper perk) and scrap all their weapons for steel. Make ammo.
---
2) Buy a subscription to Fallout 1st. Go to your private server. Claim the ammo factory workshop and just game that for days and days and days for unlimited free ammo
---
Just A thought but Scorchbeast attacks are sonic in nature. Fireproof protects from explosions. But I do not think the fireman's suit does. Personally I prefer Power Armor for protection. In all the other Fallout's it was the best. Maybe not in 76 since everything here is backwards from previous Fallout's. I have seen many players in events like Meat week or A queen event, arrive and jump into PA. Then get out of it after the battle.
---
The ammosmith perk and farming lead and steel allows me to make more than enough ammo
---
Had a similar issue during a trip.  The hotel‚Äôs firewall or settings did not allow access to Bethesda‚Äôs servers.  As was already suggested above, try through a mobile connection.
---
I would say it's definitely not good in the state that it's in.
---
Don't get me wrong, there are things that are really admirable in the game and the early game is the best part of the game. However the cracks and flaws show very quickly and only get worse the further along you go.
---
It's a real pity though as a few quests have some excellent stories that rival some of the best in other games. Really good voice acting for some of the holotapes to give you a sense of background.
---
To give you a true sense of how much the game has missed it's mark, here's a curated list of former Bethesda fanboys who would love to love the game but are also honest about what the game really is. 
---
If you can spare the time, it's well worth the watch to get a true sense of the game. None of these people are bandwagon haters for the sake of it. They were all fanboys but not blindly so.

They are? I've only had 1 person from my friends list pop into a world and they sent me a message before they did it.
---
*sits next to you*  I'm a sad panda too. üêº
---
Bethesda recommends you purchase a Fallout 1st subscription so you can have your own "private" world where you can drop items freely without interference from people who aren't on your friends list.
---
At least that way they won't have to fix yet another long-standing bug.
---
Making it into Twitch Con's finals is no small feat! I've had a couple friends compete and it is always some very serious competition. You did an awesome job, and keep up the great work!
---
Fallout 76 doesnt allow such uniforms to have an overpowered effects/statuses. You just gotta take the blasts like a pro
---
I think some subs require a certain level of karma for posting? not that I care tbh fam
---
When I‚Äôm in a pinch usually selling chems/aid items, clearing out buildings/train stations junk, and collecting all the weapons that enemies drop (Morgantown airport is pretty good for that with the added bonus of the collision event) gets me a pretty decent sum.
---
Inb4 someone says "jUsT mAkE uLtRaCiTe 308".

It‚Äôs still ugly.  I remember when it came out,  I thought to myself ‚ÄúStar Trek Online is a year old at least and still somehow looks better.‚Äù
---
Cranberry relish and other cranberry stuff gives you extra XP like the others said run white springs do some of the easy events and get a couple ahots when there is a group so you can get credit for killing higher level stuff
---
It would be cooler if you didn't waste people's time with your garbage.
---
They chose to run the servers themselves to keep complete control of the private servers and mods. If they allowed people to run the servers on their own computers then they couldn't charge for them monthly nor could they charge for putting mods on the servers.
---
You know, im kinda tired of the whole "mtx are needed to keep the game online" argument.
---
Just run the numbers yourself:
---
fallout 76 cost 60$ at launch.
---
fallout 76 has sold around 2.46 million copies as of february 2019 [(Source)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/504477/global-all-time-unit-sales-fallout-games/)
---
So, Fallout 76 generated around 120 million$ only from sales (i know that not even close to all of this money goes back to development / etc.)
---
That means, that even if they put 50 million into the game, they still got double their investment back.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As to being envious of the subscription, well, yes i want unlimited scrap storage, because, thats pay to win and bethesda clearly said, there would be no pay to win, so that isnt being entitled, but rather wanting bethesda to keep their promises.
---
As for private instances, im not against putting that behind a paywall IF and only IF players also get the options to host said instances on their own hardware, since the only thing you should be paying for is the server that hosts the instance, not the ability to host a private instance.
---
That still doesn't answer my question. Why keep playing it?
---
üòÇok champ
---
Of course they will. Gotta make the sub more desirable. If unlimited scrap isn't pat to win what if they put a vendor with unlimited caps?
---
But it is true
---
I've had it since launch, and recently uninstalled it.
---
It's certainly improved in \*some\* areas since launch, but there are still many long-standing bugs and glitches, some of which impact items and gameplay.  Still no NPCs (Wastelanders was delayed), no real story.  Just a "gather, build, farm" game with some light survival elements.
---
Community is mostly positive and helpful, but your mileage may vary.  I got about 30-40 hours of enjoyment out of it before I was tired of doing the same things over and over.  If grinding, gathering, and farming is your thing, you'll probably like it.  If you're looking for a stable experience however, I'm afraid it's not quite in that boat.
---
This is all assuming you would be playing solo.  It's more fun with friends, but even all of my friends moved on after about 30-60 hours.  
---
Then of course, there's the fact that all the signs are pointing towards this game becoming even more monetized than it already is.  So, just to temper expectations, don't expect any future content to be free.
---
TL;DR - It's fine I guess if you like Fallout and survival-ish games, but get it during a sale, and expect to pay extra for any future content.
---
Dude, do you not remember vanilla WoW and the 40 man raids? AQ40?!? hell, they had more content in vanilla WoW in just their dungeons/raids, not even talking about azeroth as a whole.
---
There used to be 200+ player PvP battles that could last upwards of hours fighting back and forth.
---
There is a reason vanilla WoW that just got rereleased topped twitch over modern WoW.
---
"This problem has been going on for a little while, so don't try to do anything about it!"
---
It really works out pretty good. You go to the private server and farm/make A bunch of power cores. Then log into A public server, break out the TSE gatling laser and get paid for your effort. I like it. Keep on griefing. And As far as that nuking my base goes it does not work. When the nuke alarm goes off I look. And if my base is targeted I just jump servers before it hits.
---
No. I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
U missed a step u forgot about acid which is need to smelt ore and to make gun powder, it can be farmed from cave cricket in Tanagra town. Cloth start collision course
---
for the time being, it will be a thing
---
&gt;Which should, if implemented correctly
---
You are morbidly naive.
---
Get the ammosmith perks
---
Check the brightness settings
---
It‚Äôs different armor lol
---
Nah
---
Really. Mine is subpar
---
Is that a troll? This game is infamous for not having brightness settings.
---
I'm really tired of "I just heard" as a justification.
---
Nice, full health build?
---
Stop.
---
I am certain you have.
---
You just dislike fallout games. This is not a fallout game
---
Yeah Instigating
---
As it stands now 1st is too new to prove where the game is going. This will have aged like milk in 6 months and this post will be remembered.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs understandable, especially not being able to place anything in it half the time
---
Oh come on please.
---
Yongyea is such a low effort Youtuber who only skims the top posts of Reddit for controversial news.
---
Unless you want a summary of Reddit top posts, don't listen to this guy.
---
Play the game or move on. If you think your whining and crying will change Bethesda's plans, good luck. You want to change things don't buy their games at all. When they fail maybe some other company will get it. But as long as you log in and play they only see A winner.
---
Even though your tone doesn't warrant politeness, I'll politely ask, demand better how? I'm not a subscriber, but let's look at basic math.
---
Bethesda tried to make the money at launch, but they released a buggy weird empty game. Then they tried to make money in the Atomic Shop from purely cosmetic items, even though that wasn't going to work, and hey, it didn't work. So then comes utility items and a paid subscription.
---
I guess you don't understand basic economics, but literally it's this or closing up shop on 76 as a whole. Why? Because they have investors now. It's a whole new ballgame, one where some of the people in control of the money aren't going to be willing to wait for a profit. That's just a reality of the situation.
---
I don't like the vast gulf between what they've said and what they've done anymore than anyone else does. I'm not defending their actions. But seriously, unless you have your own AAA game company, you don't really get a say in how AAA game companies operate in order to maintain or increase profits.
---
$130-$150 still doesn't add up to the $179.40 the op tried to say it was. They lied, you're trying to back them up, get over it.
---
this dosent make it more desirable it makes it look like a money vacuum that smacks you in the face with a shit stick everytime you spend money
---
Nice, I like seeing other builds, rather than the standard bloodied one unarmed build. Right on!
---
How much money would you be willing to pay for this improvement? Asking for my friend Todd.
---
I find fo76 rather ugly without high res texture packs and shaders added. Looks way too cartoony, and bright. But I don't really mind graphics being less than stellar. Great graphics won't make a bad game good, while a good game with crappy graphics will still be a good game.
---
Like I said, look at the top 2 most popular games of all time, both of them have "bad graphics". I mean hell minecraft textures at 16x16 "pixels", and has no rounded edges. Yet it is still the most popular game of all time.
---
EDIT: if you want better graphics with SWTOR they have high res texture packs just like this game does. Looks pretty damn impressive for such an old game.

You're comparing a 1 year old game trying to look realistic to a 7-8 year old game that was intended to be stylized from the get-go.  Apples and oranges.

Because i like the rpg side of fallout, i like the martket, i like how its like a virtual business, i like how the perks work, i like messing with different builds, i like the fact that we can create all types of builds, i like the weapons and mods, i like how funny the creatures of the wasteland can be, i like how its multiplayer, us players are the survivors, i like how theres no npc‚Äôs even tho there coming, i like having a camp, a camp built by me, i like farming materials, i like how 99% of the community is super nice and chill, i like the feeling of being in a wasteland. A lot more

Yeet!

Well, recoil compensating overcharged sighted ultracite laser rifle wasn't exactly catchy.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm not good enough to solo high level stuff and I don‚Äôt have friends that play on my platform. So I don‚Äôt have a need for a private server. Unless I‚Äôm missing something.
---
I‚Äôm confused because it says double damage on a power attack which would be 520. And added 40% when power attacking but it still only goes at 580 instead of 728
---
All my plans are half off marked value except for specific event plans. As for my legendaries, I only sell 3 star unless it has great stats, then I‚Äôll skip in a 2 star here and there. 3 stars weapons are 2k or 1500 if they‚Äôre not selling well or 2 star. 3 star armor is 1500 unless it‚Äôs scout armor, they‚Äôre 2k. Also, torso armor is 2k. All recipes (except aids) are 25. Aid recipes are half.

It almost seems like they left it out on purpose, as you can use the empty rack to display other things or use it in other ways

Let me rephrase then.  SWTOR looked like shit from the get-go.  Once I got past the poor rendering, then yeah, it was alright.  But DAMN!
---
This user made the calculation, even with ammosmith and super duper the results for 308 are insane.

Armor of enemies reduces damage

It‚Äôs a challenge. You use every bobble head and you get  80 (or 40) atomic points. It‚Äôs repeatable.

Yes. I‚Äôve done it a few times.

Ah that‚Äôll be why I keep getting different damage results cheers man

That is amazing.  Nuka T51b is my PA of choice.  I would wear the shit out of that every Halloween and gaming event.  If you ever decide to sell it or make one on commission, please let me know.

comparing hatred for a choice to hatred for how you're born is pretty different and i'm pretty sure god would see it that way too, it's a very silly comparison
---
I do remember AQ, though It wasnt released in WoW's first year now was it? It wasnt till y2? and yes, raids were great and all, but other than chasing dragons and raiding, what else did you do in the first year? getting GM was a tedious grind, though I couldnt tell you how long I spent fighting on the AV bridge, felt like days upon days, leaving a AV instance, only to get the same instance 24hours later. "Vanilla" WoW took some time before it got eventful.
---
Cheers on trying to jog my old man memories however!
---
Once again, 20 to 30$ is pretty much the same when you are talking about stuff that costs 150 to nearly 200$. I mean hell, taxes would push that 150 up to 170 easily in AU.
---
oh and one more thing, since we established the ground rule that you must try to be in top 10 players at all costs, I observed that if the initial player count is less than 25 hiding is a better choice but in a full or near full game being aggressive nets you that top 10 place easier

I did a lot of PvP playing in pvp servers and harassing the alliance in the plaugelands and crap I can't remember the name now, was like a redwood forest right before you got to the plaguelands. Now I'm gonna have to go and look it all up again. 
---
You are right about AQ40 not being at launch, it was added shortly after launch, the full list of instances at launch was:
---
&gt; Dungeons : Ragefire Chasm, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns, Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps, The Stockade, Gnomeregan, Scarlet Monastery, Razorfen Kraul, Uldaman, Scholomance, Razorfen Downs, Stratholme, Zul'Farrak, Temple of Atal'Hakkar, Blackrock Depths
---
    Raid : Onyxia's Lair, Molten Core 
---
Thanks for the excuse to hit myself with a wave of nostalgia.
---
yeah but u r cute
---
Ahhh Tauren Mill. The time off a life time.
---
They will not. They deleted my power armors in patch 11. Open multiple tickets and.spoke to multiple gms. Nothing was done.
---
You found the final boss: THE PAYWALL.
---
They fixed aa effects on energy weapons
---
I definitely didn‚Äôt see that until meow ü§ß ty
---
You could try but what matters most is what people will pay for it.
---
People tried to make serums prices like 500-800+ caps a norm when it wasn't at all hard to find them at 150-200.
---
I imagine it'll be the same problem with price guides. Rather than base the price on actual market forces they'll make up a figure and expect people to pay it and whine and complain when people undercut that made up price.
---
Going back there in... Caverns of Time? was one of the most exciting moments, just to relive the "history" 
---
uhg, this is gonna end up causing me to download battlenet and give er a go again, something I haven't done since Warlords.. and a touch of whatever the expansion was you got a artifact, though after that I kinda loss interest.
---
Looks like trump got the wall half built
---
You can get much higher than that. Get adrenal reaction and radicool. Play at about 75% health 25% radiation. It actually makes a good difference and you're still pretty close to full health.
---
Yeah, after playing minecraft and dwarf fortress, I realized graphics really aren't everything, and they can be easily modded to look better.
---
A brand new expansion is coming out and its knocking the levels back down from 120 to max of 60.
---
artifacts are post WotLK, that was the last time I played it seriously. God I miss that game, I had one of the best geared resto shamans in WotLK, now I might have to try to find a bunch of videos of resto shamans doing raids and dungeons. 
---
I swear I spent more time setting up my UI than playing that game. Half the screen full of lifebars with the old mx518 mouse having every button bound to a different heal/tidal wave(mana heal).
---
I did have a camp that was directly on top of one of the hunt quest spawn, one time I logged in and had to fight off 15-20 Yaoguai, was a blast of a time üòÜ.
---
my favorite is the time I went farming to replace the junk I lost due to the game crashing, getting killed by my camp anglers, and the game never loading in and crashing, so I lost all that junk as well.
---
Try clearing your cache, it's fine for the rest of us ..  must be something funky ... also you have a pic so we can see .. but I assume you know what it was like before ..
---
So. I've been playing Outerworlds for a handful of hours now. Which also means I'm nearly done Outerworlds. 
---
Be wary. It's hype? Was largely fueled by the internets taste for BGS bashing, because videos like "The Fallout game we deserved" gets views. 
---
So here's some objective views of the game (which I am still enjoying, it's just not this perfect experience people are making it out to be) :
---
-The dialogue is great. Best part of the game. 
---
-The combat is shallow, and on Normal things like limb targeting are useless aside from the hilarious results of bodies flying around. 
---
There's almost no weapon Variety.  We're talking 10-15 types of gun. That's the total of all guns. They don't even introduce new guns as you progress. You just start seeing Pistol MKII, Assault rifle MKII. There are I think 5 science weapons in game (which are weapons with unique effects). Then there's about the same number of Melee weapons as guns. So be prepared. The guns you're using level 1-5? You're using those guns all game. They just become MKII.
---
-It's short. When you hear 25-30 hours? You're hoping that mostly main quest.... It's not.... It is criminally short, and very heavy on fetch quests. You will likely finish the game well under the Level 30 hard cap.  You'll only come close by seriously hitting up side quests, picking every lock you find, and using every stat based dialogue choice.... Even then, probably not 30. 
---
It's got bugs- mainly fun game ruining bugs where you can't proceed in later missions. Quite a few of those. 
---
-It's small. You'll here people try to talk up how big the spaces are. They aren't. You're not going to have a handful of non objective locations to explore on your map. There's almost no exploration, and what exploration there is bland. You're not finding interesting locations. You're finding generic sci Fi buildings 1-8. 
---
-Its design is repetitive.  Almost every building, that's not a unique location? Is identical. Same type of generic sci Fi house. Same bed. Same Bathroom. Same table. Same terminal, same storage drawers. Some are bigger and some are smaller, but they are all filled with the exact same stuff.
---
-My biggest criticism? The world is just not compelling, or unique. It's a game that borrows heavily and liberally from other sources, and never quite makes it it's own thing.  Everything from quests, to companions, to the VATS system (ttd) , to its overall aesthetic? You will almost immediately recognize from other games/shows/movies and they almost always have done it better. That's on top of the heavy handed use of references and Easter eggs.... Which no longer become interesting when every moment of the game is a reference to something else.... 
---
And in reality? It's largely just a firefly knock off. A reskin. Not even a terribly good one. I'm a huge Firefly fan, so I figured, well that should be ok then.... Nope. What Firefly made compelling in less than 15 hours of television? OW couldn't do with nearly twice that. 
---
Lastly. It's nothing like Fallout. You will not get a Fallout experience out of it no matter how hard you try. This game plays far more like KotOR and mass effect. 
---
Other than some snappy dialogue and repurposing Vault Tec Adverts(Take the nuclear Americaana and replace it with Gilded Age manufacturing) they have little in common. 
---
Still a fun experience. Just not this amazing , perfect new IP it's being made out to be. 
---
In a mere week , their sub went from blind praise..... To many people saying things like "It's a 30-40 dollar game, not a $70 game"
---
Hey Bethesda... your game sucks ass, empty and boring plus you wanna try and get people to pay 100 dollars for broken mechanics ontop of broken mechanics.... I tried to jump the train when I heard about wastelanders but that got pushed and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll return.

That‚Äôs fine and all but this would be for players trying to build creative/lore friendly camps. For a lot of us camp building is basically an artform, it‚Äôd be nice if things didn‚Äôt materialize *inside* your camp every single time you get a visitor (or someone walks by within a mile of your camp).
---
Twitch... watch peoples streams, should give you a good idea of the game.
---
Yea especially with the helmet, it‚Äôs actually better than most other PA skins. I hope the three red eyes actually glow. The handmade skin is also really cool, i don‚Äôt remember ever seeing an army green AK in real life, but it works really well.
---
I can agree my only point is it's just a game yet people treat it like they need a lot of caps and a lot of us who play dont have time to farm the amount of caps they are asking for
---
I remember the first time I installed "Sexy map" god that made the mini map look amazing.
---
Oh noes, do fallout related metaphors in a fallout subreddit scare you?
---
I just can't for the life of me figure out why they would, if it was intentional.
---
Oh it's the Fallout 1st lobby portal? Lol
---
The biggest game changer for me mod wise wasn't at launch, but a while after it was the tom tom quest helper mod which is now built into the game, auctioneer, baggins, then I moved on to this other quest mod I think it was called "carbonite questing" man that mod was INSANE.
---
Or the Mew under the truck
---
I like turtles!
---
What did you make it out of?
---
I'm a metalworker, a welder, fabricator.. a good friend of mine is a mechanical engineer. We have every intention on constructing a full-functioning set of power armor. 
---
It may not be a bad idea to assemble a crude model beforehand.
---
Exactly and it's ridiculous cause now people are expecting those prices you know monkey see monkey do besides It doesnt make sense that people want that much for an item
---
YES, that shit so fun. Literally that's what fatmans are for in this game.
---
This is about watching your friend get clean. That‚Äôs not self destructive or self improving. Abandoning your friend for getting clean is ridiculous
---
I remember auctioneer would crash my game, I miss/dontmiss that pc. ahhh the days of being broke af.
---
So from reading everyone's comments I can conclude average and meta gamers dont know how to price things lmao
---
The problem is, people whine and complain because they suck or can't handle dying. Then bethesda messed with the damage numbers so much they gave up on the mode. What's to stop this from happening again?
---
I agree something seems more military like about it then others.
---
Honestly I want some snowflakes to come out of the wood works and tell me what is wrong with my idea. If you really don't want to be killed just turn on pacifist don't take a workshop. If you don't turn on pacifist you have no one to blame but yourself for being griefed.
---
HAHAH
---
&gt; but literally it's this or closing up shop on 76 as a whole.
---
I mean, these things were always planned in some capacity. Remember when white knight held tons in keeping armor repaired especially with that one luck perk? Then it got nerfed so it wouldn't be a "mandatory perk" It's honestly still as used as before, but now it's less effective and it was just in time for repair kits!
---
Bethesda creates a problem mechanic wise, and if the problem wasn't exacerbated enough, they would make the issue worse. Carry weight issue while exploring? Buy a scrap kit to break and bank that junk! Food spoiling too fast? Get a fridge! Scrap taking up too much of your stash? Well, buy FO1st!
---
There already was a notification I believe back when you could destroy camps.
---
Go to a low level area (Sutton, Helvetia, etc.) with scorched and take them out with melee.  Collect and amass all the ammo they drop.  The lumberyard in the far northwest works too, just with muties instead.
---
Yea you should be able to rob stash boxes of junk and maybe aid as well.
---
:D
---
That is the case for any and all software you buy. Be it games or other, be it on PC or console, be it digital or physical.
---
Ahh, nevermind.. I asked before I checked the album.
---
For us, the making of the power armor will be pretty easy.. making it function mechanically will be the challenging part.
---
But.. that's his problem, not mine lol
---
All the time
---
Making them or buying them from player vendors are probably your best best. Unlike 10mm, .308s, and shotgun shells there aren't really any consistent mobs to farm for them.
---
Use strength on the truck to get Mew.
---
Absolutely 0 entitlement in what I said. That's what everyone whining about the subscription is suffering from. You don't like your situation? Change it. Otherwise stop your bellyaching. 
---
Never said they couldn't unwind and play a game. Although I fail to see how any of this constitutes as "unwinding". Fact is, if $13 a month is a deal breaker for you, then video games should be your LAST concern.
---
Next time I want your maladjusted opinion, I'll give it to you, how's that?
---
Playing with a new player thats getting frustrated because he sees damage numbers but its dying so quick hes getting about 50% credit. They should just tag it into quest rewards for events. But i guess this helps prevent afk a little.
---
That‚Äôs cool man good idea I‚Äôll give it a go
---
So you defend the game religiously, but you don't play it. Makes sense.
---
Excavator suit and Lucky Hole Mine for lead. Grafton Steel and West Tek for super mutant weapon scrapping for steel and gunpowder. Equip super duper and ammosmith perks.
---
I keep my base at bear the farm south of the Top of the World. The one where Free Range ends, granted it not an unmarked location but 3 enemies will respawn next to the pond every time a player fast travels to my camp and I love it. Countless times I have came back to my camp to find meat piles everywhere. A handful of times I‚Äôd be on the right server and there would be legendary‚Äôs that spawn, those were amazing. I keep two heavy turrets and one middle launcher turret which typically keep most of the enemies at bay.
---
So much steel though. Ive started trying to suppliment my steel supply with that scrapper perk, but its still so much.
---
Here is before and after image https://imgur.com/gallery/ImJC9jz
---
5mm ammo is everywhere. I‚Äôve never crafted it and have close to 20k
---
5mm is really easy to craft, especially with ammosmith. 5.56 has a little less per batch, but still not difficult to make yourself.
---
Put on excavator armor, farm Licky Hole Mine for lead. Smelt lead. Run uranium fever or clear west tek and huntersville for the steel from weapons. Farm Tanagra town for the acid to smelt and make gunpowder. 
---
Boom, profit. I mean ammo.
---
Crafting it is simple enough, especially with +80% perk. 
---
I frequently come across camps selling it for 1 cap. It‚Äôs more commonly set at 2 caps, but there are still plenty of 1s. 
---
And honestly, I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had someone successfully take the ammo factory. Equip contractor and 3 star defence card, fill the inside of the building with missiles and you are set to go. When you fast travel to the factory when someone tries to take it over, you spawn right in front of the extractor. Stand back and either let the turrets do their work or cause the opponent to lose interest.
---
That is better than mine.
---
My armor is named like "X Combat Armor C" for chest. Follow same scheme, I use LL for left leg, RA for right arm, etc. It puts it at the bottom of the menu list and is easily identifiable to me.
---
You may want to edit stat. For a very simple reason. A terrible lapse in reading comprehension. A secondary in a jump to conclusions
---
I was talking about the junkie‚Äôs current state being self destructive, and getting clean is analogous to hoping that he improves.
---
Your misunderstanding and pedantry added nothing to this conversation.
---
Reboot TV, looks like it's got it's knickers in a twist with HDR, happened to me before.
---
Get your Ammosmith perk maxed and collet all the lead and steel. A little cloth and acid for gunpowder crafting (or kill lots of Super Muties as they drop it) and you're set. Craft ammo!
---
P.S. tin can chimes are the easiest way to collect steel and lead simultaneously. Between Camden park and the prison I keep myself fueled quite well and server hopping to farm chimes is usually a successful endeavor. Lots of lead at the monorail, Charleston Firestation, and Green County Lodge.
---
Agreed. It's fun, but not a FO or ES replacement...yet. Hopefully MS gives Obsidian $$ to make make bigger maps.
---
Would that come through on captures though? I feel like it‚Äôs the game if it shows it through screenshots
---

Thank you

same thing happened to me a week or two ago. i tried everything i could but eventually had to delete and reinstall the game. it worked, i was able to sign in BUT i lost every photo in my gallery. was very disappointed.
---
Also Borderlands 3 and The Outer Worlds still look the same. Look the same as in they are fine.

Sometimes after a freeze i shut the xb1 off  then unplug or tur off the surge protector. Then power xb1 up and it's fine again.
---
Inside of the whitespring is usually dark.
---
I bet you talk in a Mid-Atlantic accent. Enjoy your rip off game. Maybe try a new better game like I don't know The Outer Worlds, which was made by the guys who made the last great Fallout game. Maybe trade your thesaurus collection in for Social Interactions for Dummies.
---
Full health, be sure to use all of your available buffs.  The perk that doubles the effects of alcohol is good.  Adrenaline 3+ with a few kills, whiskey, Fury, Overdrive, ..  presuming your at 15 base strength with all available melee devotions taken.
---
If able to use sneak and take advantage of perks/armor...  you can crouch, sneak power attacks for well past 2k.  
---
This is a situational sort of play style that revolves around heavy drug/alcohol use.  It‚Äôs not the easiest to adjust to playing.
---
fallout76 is filled with technical issues, empty promises hell even pay to win aspects are literally broken. empty private worlds and scrapbox literally deleting your scraps so tell me sir who are the adults without ethics? the guys that got scammed or the company that scammed them?
---
Buy them from the amusement park if you are looking for them
---
Too funny haha it‚Äôs surprising how much life I can fit in around my Fallout habit :) no kids helps
---
What system you on? You can take the ammo plant on my private sever If you like when I play- I use fusion cores
---
It‚Äôs a weapon made Legendary by your own character‚Äôs legacy. I love this!
---
The in your SPECIAL stands for Creativity. And you maxed it out. üëç
---
There‚Äôs a trading sub that‚Äôs useful for getting stuff like this, if I post it‚Äôs name it gets removed on here though! Have a search though you‚Äôll find it!
---
If I'm honest no idea, but I've had the same sort of issue, looks the same at least and a full reboot of the TV fixed it. Even if it's not the same issue what do you have to lose by rebooting  Also if it's the TV having the issue it'll affect all games
---
Really, what will the seller DO with that "money"? 
---
Sure, sell your super-rare legacy for 10k. What will you BUY with that money?
---
It's not hard to make caps in this game. What is hard is finding something to spend the caps on.
---
Correct
---
Later,  mo.
---
They‚Äôre really expensive. That‚Äôs why I was hoping I could get them elsewhere.
---
There was more content in the dungeons and raids at launch than this game has in total.
---
Here is the lsit of the raids. Gnomer itself is nearly as large as at least 2 of the zones in this game, Molten core is probably larger than at least another 2 zones, and that is only 2 of the 15 instances.
---
&gt;Dungeons : Ragefire Chasm, Deadmines, Wailing Caverns, Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps, The Stockade, Gnomeregan, Scarlet Monastery, Razorfen Kraul, Uldaman, Scholomance, Razorfen Downs, Stratholme, Zul'Farrak, Temple of Atal'Hakkar, Blackrock Depths
---
    Raid : Onyxia's Lair, Molten Core
---
I just got back from vacation. I'd trade a tattered field jacket for the new firefighter outfit on Xbox one..
---
I wouldn't know, I was busy crashing in tarren mill with everyone else who actually played the game.
---
No one was in molten core, it didn't even work right the first time it was raided. You should know that though, huh?
---
I‚Äôve never seen or heard of excavator mod drops, only being able to buy them.
---
Feel lucky, I wish this game was darker
---
LOL, you think bethesda is any different? You think they would go and get themselves kicked out of the largest market on the planet for video games?
---
ActiBlizz doesn't give a shit one way or the other about HK, all they care about is $$$, just like zenimax.
---
You had to pay for this game too...
---
I do the same. I move what I consider tradable status to a mule and the rest is 3 star with usually a weight reduction. None in which I would say are complete trash nor expensive beyond a fair price. But they only stay on until I need something to use for scrip. Which again isn‚Äôt often. I have one vendor that is roughly 1/2 off prices for regular plans and another vendor that‚Äôs quite a bit more expensive but it‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt common plans or people don‚Äôt farm those plans. Like prime Gatling lasers. I‚Äôll put it for 2-2.5k. It‚Äôs about average for reddit prices. I just know what customers that I‚Äôm trying to target. So I base things off that. But then you have tons of people who think a ghoul slayers 10mm with limb damage is somehow worth 5-10k
---
Worked fine for me and my guild. Played from vanilla up to the release of Cata. Maybe one of your addons was causing issues with your install?
---
Don‚Äôt go through you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed.
---
 Its just a preview of wastelanders 
---

---
Exactly this. Trade isn't working doesn't = I'm putting something valuable on the floor with some random guy next to me.
---
Secret service? Mind linking it?
---
Fkkin amazing

Check out a recent video by Juicehead on youtube
---
Stack all the xp increase effects you can (google for these). 
---
Get some kind of relatively quick auto or semi auto rifle (aiming from the hip is best, may be a perk for it) and spam events including mischief night at the top of every hour.
---
 Join higher level players at more challenging/enemy heavy events. Get a few shots in on an enemy and move right on to the next letting the higher levels actually kill it. Something with easy to come by ammo like .38 or 10mm is good for this.
---
LOL, no it isn't. Go look at the starter zone for goblins in WoW. It is as large as this entire map, and WAY more densely packed than this game. You literally can't walk more than 50 yards without running into an NPC, or enemy.
---
And an ego the size of Texas? Typical spoiled Chad, gets called out for being a twat, and Reeees like a stuck pig about how everyone else is wrong....
---
Are you tinkering your guns up to 5 levels higher than your current level? If not that could be why the guns don't feel very good, because they are under powered.
---
I've never had more than 1 1" drop from that event...
---
bro we need to get you playing some good games i honestly feel bad for you
---
I've seen no evidence of this on PC. I have the FO1st sub and I wear my ranger outfit but have yet to have to be 'targeted' All the  articles claiming otherwise are just people still bitter from the terrible release of the game. Scaring new customers away is their intent.
---
Yeah, but i like it, one shot everything is boring
---
I feel like if someone is dumb enough to believe that they'll discover it on there own. Hell if someone told me that, I'd tell them to prove it
---
You might need the home defense perk for the spotlights to show up.
---
But do you use it? All the guns that use 5mm blow through ammo like crazy.
---
The Gatling gun is super powerful and doesn‚Äôt blow through ammo

All good mate!  Yeah I looked into making it work and I found the power requirements are pretty immense to have enough motors with high enough torque to be able to last a full day, short of developing portable nuclear power some clever gearing is in order to compensate.
---
Nope, they're explosions from the point view of the engine.  Fireproof and dense mods protect against SB "sonic" attacks. (Not against the piss of death).
---
Cheers!  I'm probably gonna be hanging on to this one as it has a bit of my soul (and genetic material from all the spots I bled over it)  and commissions are pretty much impossible due to how long they take to build and cost--materials alone would run $5k.
---
yw!
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks! :)
---
Huh that‚Äôs interesting thanks
---
I‚Äôve logged about 1400hrs in the game since launch. I would say I got my monies worth. Despite the bugs, it‚Äôs still a good game and I‚Äôve played through the worst bugs and crashes. The game is tremendously better now but people still hate on it. Whateves cause I enjoyed my time with it and still play it.
---
This is so accurate, I don‚Äôt even know what to say other than I agree
---
Tell that to John Wayne Gacy
---
I mean, having a friend run and tag everything in the gold club and lead them outside is another good reason. Especially if it‚Äôs a two shot.
---
I would think the one from one of the dlcs
---
That's awesome
---
I feel part of the strategy is diversifying.  If you rely too much on a single ammo type, it's going to be problematic because you have nothing else to fall back on.
---
what?
---
I don't remember giving you your opinion, weird.
---
Again, you're the one being a twat here. Can't take the heat? Get out of the kitchen. It's a cheap, optional subscription. Buy it or don't, but people need to stop whining so gods damned much over it.
---
Also, the name's not Chad.
---
What armour bonus are you referring to?
---
Glass costs 800 atoms...
---
I hadn't heard of it until I watched that video. Pretty interesting to see what happens
---
Also not the combat shotgun while they are basically identical.
---
1) I've got fascinated by F3's teaser, played that first, then NV and after falling in love with it and since I was a lil bit older at that point I played 1 and 2, then 4 and 76 but to be honest I bought 76 reluctantly and after 200 hours I still think its a really truly mediocre game that doesn't fit the franchise. so a fan since 08?
---
2) Maybe around 1000 if all are combined, NV alone is 500+, other 3d ones are around 70-80 with 76 being 200ish.
---
3) NV is not just my favorite fallout game, but one of my favorite games of all time along with titles like SotN, Hollow Knight and RDR2. I love immersion I guess huh.
---
thanks for the survey fam

They are talking about unsubstantiated rumors.

Welcome to the world of Empath mutations on solo
---
What do you care how people choose to spend their money?
---
Wow! This is amazing!
---
If you get kills plus survive, you are making the most of your time.
---
If a new player is at the event and not getting loot that isn‚Äôt my problem, don‚Äôt get mad at me and force me to play differently because the game is poorly designed. Complain to Bethesda to change it. Don‚Äôt tell me how to play idc if your new or not I don‚Äôt have time to deal with other players being worthless.
---
I think I have from SBQ events.
---
I like to say quad dose not drop on "conventional" heavy weapons
---
Also I know there's a few legacy double gattling, mini, and 50cals floating around. In XB1
---
Having looked at plans spawn locations and nested rewards lists, I definitely think some things are insanely too rare. I get the grind aspect, but some things need work. There's no reason why light and heavy Raider base armor plans are only available once per character via a chance from Signal Strength, but sturdy Raider base armor plans can drop from multiple quests.
---
Dang I would have loved that handmade :(
---
Sneaky bastards
---
Nope. No hunger &amp; well hydrated. Before the last update my stats would be in the 20-30 point range now they are in the 6-10 range with and without unyielding armor. Classfreak is equiped to reduce negative mutation effects by 75%.
---
Which is what???
---
Ree, reee look at me guys, I'm important, reeee reeee rreeeee!
---
As far as I'm aware all bandanas offer protection without a PER penalty as do Fasnacht masks and a few atom shop items like the plague doctor mask.
---
Because people deserve a better product for what they pay for. That is all :(
---
If you have an overload of water  see if you can dilute some of your radaways and stimpaks. If not just sell them to the vendor. Your gonna have too much at some point and you might not even take them from your purifiers anymore.
---
I really wish they would add double back to heavy weapons. I don't understand why it was removed.
---
They decided the product was worth their money. You prob don‚Äôt even play the game. You watch YouTube videos.
---
Lol Chaddy Boy blocked me. xD And here I was just about to tell him how we don't need entitled shits like him in this community.
---
I thought that people that got the bonuses were losing them? Juicehead made a video about it. Did they fix that then?
---
This?

---
I've played this game since BETA. I got suckered into this game too and defended it until recently.
---
I'm always looking for raw cloth, rubber and leather, and then molded plastic. 1 cap per for the first group and up to 2 caps for plastic (maybe 3 caps per piece for small quantities).  I've spent 3k caps at one vendor before, who had large quantities of what I needed.  Good luck!
---
It should be 100 rounds for everything and just adjust the amount of required materials
---
The glowing meat steak is basically a default go-to too because it's easily available and its 10% melee buff is very handy
---
Very odd how I get a lot of lag but still complete the event and get the reward 100% of the time
---
Started by playing Fallout4 at release(2016).  The wife &amp; I enjoyed that game so much that I purchased a second setup so we could play simultaneously.  Which leads to why we love playing 76. Hours played:  FO4 1010hrs, FO76 &gt;1300hrs.  I have FO3 &amp; NV but haven't spent much time there.  
---
Current favorite is 76. Even with the bugs &amp; glitches, it still gives the wife &amp; I plenty of hours of fun. We aren't trying to get the best of the best or finish it in a short time.  We just wander the wasteland, making friends &amp; having fun without the need to be a cap-ionaire.
---
I have racked over 1200 hours , I can‚Äôt say I regret it. They have issues needing to be fixed and some of the play can get stale but as an outlet it seems to work for me. Will I invest in more time? Not sure , but they need to add and fix things to keep me going. Will I reach 7600 hours who knows. But for now it is an outlet that a burn an hour or more daily.  It would be nice if they worked on fixing the prime issues that others have so clearly stated and don‚Äôt need repeating on this comment.
---
Oh yeah, same here! I was going to post something on it myself. Like the boost is stats is needed for sure.
---
This, this is the best way hands down besides investing some earnings in materials for ammo. You may have a smaller return but can make ammo way faster and 5.56 always sells at a 1:1 ratio
---
I have yet to see the reward screen for mischief night, but I have stuff, so there‚Äôs that.  They just appear in my inventory.
---
Did someone order a dad joke? Here you are: How does the moon cut his hair? Eclipse it.
---
The Bethesda launcher is going to start mining bitcoin to "offset development costs".
---
...there's no such thing as "sonic damage" in 76. Damage types are ballistic, energy, explosive, acid (and radiation if you want to get technical about it).
---
This is literally how you fund expansions for the game. No need to be rude.
---
Yes when i was leveling up my toon i noticed that wearing two pieces of unyielding doesn‚Äôt boost any stats even when my health was near zero. I had thought maybe because I had rad worms or something. Nope it was always like that.
---
As with all hand crafted items if you paid what it was worth you couldn't afford not want it. My wife quilts and no one is going to pay her anything near minimum wage to actually make a quilt. Understand if someone hands makes you something is worth 10-100x what it costs to buy a mass produced item. She also knits socks and a pair will take arguing 40 hours to make. 
---
He day job pays around 107/Hr, making a pair worth ~$4300, even minimum wage makes a pair ~500. A quilt is much more active time and a much longer project. 
---
Now 3D printing is roughly $20/kg for filament and most places charge you $0.12 per gram and $1 an hour for just printing the parts. That armor is probably several rolls of filament(1kg per roll) and several hundred hours of printing time. Then probably more hours sanding and painting.
---
Pretty bad if your just playing for the event. On PS4 it‚Äôs prone to crashing, sometimes right before the end. Missed 5 plus today alone. That‚Äôs 5 hours of me anticipating I was gonna get a reward but getting blue screened.
---
I would say unlucky. I've played it dozens of times and I have always received rewards, haven't crashed. 
---
Yeah the frame rate has dropped ridiculously at times and competing against other players to get a hit on the legendary is a pain. Hell, competing against others for the damn "ttick or treat" is a pain.
---
How *you* doin'?
---
My carry weight is higher without power armor ...
---
Dumb
---
It amuses me how some people grossly overprices stuff, like stimpaks for 60c, purified water for 20c and .38 for 2c, and yet they let their Brahmins outside...
---
Maybe so.. I'm playing on xbox game pass and I'll buy it on sale once it's on steam.
---
I'd argue it's worth $60 more than most AAA releases are though.
---
Yep. Tried taking it all off, back on, log off, console reset...nope, strength and other stats lower than it was at my 20 percent level. Makes sense vanguard might be affected too. Anyone notice anything wrong with bolstering?
---
It 100% does not
---
Would you rather them just release what they have now?
---
Doesn't matter I just got a refund for every game I've ever bought from them :) Fuck EA
---
I found one today from one of the lockers you unlock from the keys a Mole Miner's sometime drop.  I don't know if the mod plans will drop from enemies but it is at least in the loot tables for those lockers and hopefully other chests/trunks in zones.   
---
As previously mentioned, the fastest way is to just buy them at various vendors but all the good mods cost a lot of caps.
---
Lmao you‚Äôll come crawling back eventually.
---
One thing I've learned in my youth years is to never dare my Asian friends... Amazing work, dude.
---
as employees they failed to deliver a desirable product on time again and again, why keep giving them credit?
---
But it just works tho.
---
Duh. The Fixer already has a custom skin. Maybe you should have paid attention before grinding for it.
---
There‚Äôs a handful that are drops but not many.
---
I didn't do any of that. Just explaining why some people want to be courteous.
---
FPS was unmarried from the physics engine many patches ago. You won't encounter any issues in terms of being banned for running 60+; 500hrs+ of my playtime has been in g-sync mode and well over 100fps.
---
My recent PC has lasted through at least 2 generations of consoles.
---
More folks could do with the wisdom you have ;)
---
Cheers mate!
---
Upvote simply for the use of schadenfreude.  :)
---
I have 1200 hours myself, played since launch and almost daily, but the game play does get stale a bit sometimes. The endeavor to get my dream gear from purveyor and all the plans I can keep me coming back daily. I don't regret it, and definitely have gotten my money's worth. I once talked to a level 500+ who said he had 2700 hours at that time which seemed impressive.
---
180, yes
---
Wow. That's not very cash money of you. No need to make it personal. And for what its worth, even an Angry Pleb subscribes to FO1st.
---
Tl;dr:
---
WAAAAAAAAAH! I'm a poor!
---
Alright, thanks.
---
Sound like you're buying PCs pre-built, like a chump.  A mid-range rig that can comfortably run most games nowadays should only cost around $600-$800.
---
Expansions that suck ass for a game that sucks ass :)
---
Do I do the same as about a year ago, change a 1 to a 0 in the pref file?
---
I am at 979 hours and I took March through most of June off.  I regret nothing, why would I?  Been enjoying the game.
---
Are the fireman's outfit and helmet outfits that are new to the game or were they rare before?
---
Yeah the rng can just be shit sometimes. I did five runs today and got all the same stuff, civil war outfits and lamp plans.
---
He's from NY. It's like in their blood to try n fight everyone at once
---
Yep; iPresentInterval=0
---
Yea ok
---
Come on dude, don't be a dick. You just make the other Fallout 1sters who already have a poor image look worse.
---
This.  I get lag spikes out the wazoo at Mischief Night.  Last night, the last row of cabins didn't even load in until the event was nearly over.
---
But I haven't had it crash during Mischief Night and it rarely crashes otherwise.
---
PC BTW
---
That would be a weird thing, but I still would not have to buy them.  This is just someone making up slipper slope bullshit.
---
Idk maybe 500? No I don't regret it because when I play, believe it or not, I have fun.
---
You could pay 100 dollars to find it first try on a private server
---
Always when i travel to the charlest√≥n powerplant
---
The real issue is will it stay fixed. Bethesda has a particularly bad track record of fixed bugs returning back into the game.
---
I want in on this as well. PSN: tehsandman. Come grief a player who puts Fallout 1st.
---
The Australian market I‚Äôm guessing would be small and the condition of if you requested a refund limits that more. I didn‚Äôt bother requesting a refund nor did anyone else I know.
---
The refunds for sure would be nothing compared to what they would have been fined for non-compliance. Fallout 1st will make back the money quick if the leaks that they are going further with the subscriptions is true. Hell they are delaying free trials because the sub count is going too well.
---
Why bad image? Ppl getting targeted out here for no reason. Come get some then
---
Xbox gt Superblegend92
---
It's just big talk from the food dudes, they aren't grieving anyone.

I just buy all my ammo from vendors at 1c/rnd
---
There is a full human skeleton on bench shrine with the moth man eggs in point pleasant.
---
Their on PS4 my guy

I haven't blocked anyone. You're so unimportant, I don't feel the need to.
---
You should brush up on your definition of "entitlement", I'm not the one expressing that.
---
You're also the only one making pig noises, so... ya. There's that too.
---
You're entitled to 1 thing, and that's the right to remain silent.
---
And please do so, the oxygen is starting to get thin in here.
---
do you know how to craft marine wetsuit helmet?
---
Thanks. I dunno why people make up shit about this game.
---
I wanna be grieved also , I‚Äôm fallout first , psn deuce_sixs
---
A crossbow bolt is very different from a railway spike or harpoon. Very, very different. Also, I use a harpoon gun often. You get over 3k damage a hit with the right perks and a BE.
---
What really bothers me are people that doesn't understand what is a 'Unsigned Integer' trying to explain why "infinite" scrap needs more hardware, and so players must pay for it.
---
Seriously, it really hurts, stop that.
---
The private sessions.
---
Before Fallout 1st, I stopped playing in mid December last year due to all the people using exploits/hacks/etc. ruining events and sessions for just about everyone (at least in the servers I was on and saw complaints from others and experienced for myself during nukes).  
---
The private sessions gives me the option I wanted most if player servers ever became a reality which was a way to play without all the toxic cheaters. 
---
I have been having a blast and I am only subscribing monthly.  
---
The scrap box and the junk collecting robot are completely worth getting from Fallout 1st and Atom shop (using Fallout 1st atoms).
---
About 1100
---
How do you do this?
---
I uninstalled it on the past Wednesday because I was on the same mood as you. I was kinda done with the game for this year but decided to stay for the event, but the laggy and unstable servers and the crashes were just enough for me. I'm in South America but the game assign us to NA servers, so I'm already on at least 130-ish ping even on the few times when the servers are good, but since the patch 14, I was barely playing because the enemies were literally rubberbanding all over the place, so the game crashes were just the cherry on top. I need those 80 gigs of space on my HDD more than I need to get frustrated and pissed off every time I try to play.
---
 Tl;dr: Get out while you still can.
---
Obviously OP knows this.
---
He just means from a gameplay standpoint.
---
A general ammo called ‚ÄúBolt‚Äù so it is less weight.
---
Kind of like how when you reload a weapon you already magically have a spare clip with full ammo, or you can pull the remaining .45 out of your rifle to reload your Thompson.
---
What system you on?
---
Xbox one
---
In all fairness, it read as if you thought that watching someone get clean was somehow bad.
---
Dm me- you can play with my private sever when you see me on- all I ask is you leave the work shops open and no pvp 
---
If your are above 18 you can join our player faction- tons of private servers around.
---
Or just play on mine- all good
---
I mean does the difference really matter, they‚Äôre all spike or dart based ammos. Sure there‚Äôs a few godly legendary combinations but of course those are pretty rare and few have them. This is supposed to help out the average player get into using good drops they find instead of scriping them just because of the unpracticality of the type of weapon.
---
People always think so.
---
&gt; So they need money to keep putting things into the game.
---
lololol as if they're reinvesting any money they get from players.
---
We don‚Äôt have bad images and the opinions of idiots shouldn‚Äôt be taken seriously
---
Make Todd Howard's bank account get bigger.
---
You are bragging that ya paid money to have the game dumbed down for you. Holy shit.  It destroys the game economy. You don't care about that though cuz fuck everyone else, right? Thirsty players should be banished to First ONLY worlds.  I don't want to sell my hard earned scrap and weapons to Thirty players. Give me the ability to block them from my CAMP...they don't need to use my shit. They paying for a private tent. Fuck em. Being a bad consumer hurts the entire gaming community as it gives companies the green light to continue pay to win practices so I have zero issues with walking away from venders and dumping my spoiled meat when I see that blue box or thumbs down/sick emoting the cute dances.
---
I've played 400h and I just regret the last 5 or so of it...
---
They don't want your resources, they want to kill you. The resource gathering at workshops is slower than if you just went out specifically looking and scavenging for scrap. Even the ammo factory; got 200 rounds from the machine yesterday in the same time it took me to scavenge enough lead and steel for 1800 rounds. 
---
Workshops are the only way left to PvP in this game, which some players enjoy. If you really want to take and hold workshops, don't hang around after you've claimed it.
---
Actually you forgot the most important part of the equation; the cost of production.
---
Fo76 cost $100 Million to produce.
---
They put it on sale right after launch, so most people didn't pay $60. More like 20-40$. I paid $20 for example. So, we're already in the negativex just from game sales.
---
Now factor in server rental fees, because they use Sony's servers. Overhead (payroll, licensing fees, utilities, office space, advertising).
---
So ya, MTX are necessary. You just tried to leave out the bits that made the math not work in your favor.
---
This is sometimes the only pvp you can get on a server though. Just like you want to have your moment, let them have their moment of entertainment. Times are tough for raiders with all the private servers and passive mode people.
---
The scrap box changes components from an item to a currency with a single saved value. So, it's actually LESS strain on the server. That being said, it would take away from the allure of the subscription, and this game desperately needs income right now.
---
Is it really how that works? The world is always stocked and ready to go?
---
See me other response.
---
Actually it's our money that will help bankroll future content but keep on hatin'.
---
Scavenge lead from nuke silos, scavenge weapons from super mutants and break thrm down. Breaking down a single assault rifle with Scrapper gets you 20 steel. Don't forget to use Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
#Doesn‚Äôt matter, shut up.
---
I am gonna find out! I believe we have to go to the Bethesda site. There was a post explaining how a week or so ago. If I find it, I will pm it to you.
---
Well I did think TESVI would be out by then, but i guess anticipated release is set for 2023? Man that's a long time off.
---
Hmmm very good to know.
---
Meh? They're not spec'd out identical, ones got a scope &amp; other is red dot etc
---
Clear out Grafton Dam, Whitesprings Golfclub and cottages, and West Tek. Crazy mob density and xp to be had there, as well as tons of guns to vendor or scrap. If it's already clear, server hop and try again. Rinse and repeat.
---
No, capitalism works by supply and demand. There was a demand for this game, they supplied it. Buggy, as usual for Bethesda. The beautiful thing about capitalism is whiny little shits don't get to decide who "deserves" to stay in business based on some perceived slight.
---
Outfit was not in game at all, the helmet was available from the toy vendor in The Whitespring, sometimes you have to hop servers for him to be selling it though.
---
There is some sort of secret service. If they are living or dead is a different story.
---
HOW will it hurt you? Can you show me on this doll where the subscription touched you? Was there penetration?
---
1500.  
---
I've enjoyed my experience.  Alone, it becomes very boring at times at end game level.  But what's kept me playing is running into some amazing people.  Sure, the whole nerfing really irritated me to almost quitting.  But the few people that allow me to to run with them for almost a year makes the game worth it.
---
Where do you get the 100$ million figure from?
---
As for the sale, thats bethesdas decision, maybe they should not put the game on sale, if they need the revenue.
---
Edit: 
---
Fallout 4 Dev costs are estimated at around 90-120 million, Fallout 76 is developmentally not a big step up from fallout 4 so the development costs will be considerably lower
---
1500 game hours
---
Big Mouth - IE pump shot gun. Tends to get me killed or crippled whenever I use it.  
---
Ocho - Quad double barrel shotgun
---
\-And that is exactly why Bethesda is going to keep doing it to us, ladies and gentlemen. This attitude right here.
---
Thanks man!  I appreciate it!
---
I lucked out and got both from the event, pretty happy
---
For the low low price of $13 a month you too can have all the workshops on the map! Anyone who's ever tried that on an empty server before knows how impossible it would be to actually run them all solo, even without other players. The defend events alone would keep taking them away.
---
Oh absolutely. The Mods add so much replayability to Fallout 4.
---
Yes, unlimited ammo for my Railway. I love it.
---
Indeed

Come grief me then. If you think a private tent it a payb2 win feature your the sheep
---
How dare you enter the tent of a king 
---
A simple google search took me to a website that broke it all down for me. I'm sure you have this "magical" Google doohickey too.
---
No one was buying it, so it went on sale. That's how things work.
---
The subscription is actually making them decent amounts of revenue now, so they finally got something right, cashflow wise.
---
dude, great work!
---
Can I have your junk? I have tons of space for it
---
It picks up a bit more as you leave the first world. It's a lot more like KoToR than Fallout 4. Hub spaceship that you take from smaller planet to planet.
---
Wanna share a link maybe?
---
A simple "use Google" wont suffice as a source i fear
---
Yeah. It might be time for Bethesda to get a new engine.
---
Yeah, if they implement this a lot of players are going to be pissed they dropped all that ammo
---
That would be hilarious if true, remember fanboys that Bethesda needs more funding, pay up or they will never release wastelanders! It is your fault if you do not spend enough.
---
I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for this but how is fallout 1st pay to win? It doesn‚Äôt really give anything that will make you ‚Äúwin‚Äù the game. Sure it gives u a nice tent &amp; shit like that but that doesn‚Äôt automatically make you win the game it just gives what some people have been requesting for like privates, emotes &amp; quality of life things nothing u get from fallout 1st is really p2w
---
These people are getting paid every week. It's not as if they only get a goddamn check because they turned in a modding assignment. Ask Obsidian fans what happens when you turn out to bail out a game. Hint: the company goes bust and gets swallowed up by Microsoft anyway. The part where what you do, as a consumer, impacts all other consumers is where I will be directing my hating. There's no excuse for being a dumb consumer.
---
All I need is one bolt or whatever if harpoons and Railways take the same ammo and I‚Äôm set forever. Why would anyone be mad they now have more ammo than they‚Äôll ever need?
---
5 k caps. 2.5 now and 2.5 when I kill them
---
super weak take, if you stop and think about it.
---
I‚Äôm saying that whenever most people get any of these kinds of ammo they drop them because hardly anyone uses the kinds of guns that they‚Äôre used for
---
Log in. Farm ledge spots that are always there. Log out. Log in. Farm ledge spots that are always there. No competition whatsoever. No junk weight is the real kick in the teeth. Modders have been requesting privates so they can mod the game and they want to mod the game so they can make money. Players have been begging for server stability.. so now they can have it! ..if they pay.
---
You can find many of the mods themselves at random locations.
---
Of course, I found them more often after I bought the ones I really wanted at vendor bots.
---
I know I'm watching their stream lol was telling ppl to grief me.
---
Yes please sell me vault stairs i already used extensively in fo4.   Delay actual content when there is literally nothing to do.   Ive explored the entire map, this game sucks now.
---
I just crept over 800 hours, and other than the crashes and freezes, and the occasional jerk, I'm loving it. The vast majority of people I run into are cool, and that random factor helps to keep things fresh.
---
Super mutants drop Both 5.56 and 5mmm along with gunpowder.  Lucky hole mine, scrap runs, super duper 3 and ammosmith to make as much as you need
---
But I'm not even a challenge. Like I said, I'm only lvl 60. The people that come after me are 100 or 200+. I simply cannot compete.
---
Getting kill/downs/revives isn‚Äôt all that big of a deal as far as XP goes unless maybe you‚Äôre just cleaning house and get like 20 kills but that is extremely unlikely. What you want is to consistently get placement xp for making top 10. The big XP payouts come from the amount of time you survive and higher placement. You basically want to hide until you get down to the last few people. 
---
Get good loot for most of the match, play it safe, skirt the outer edge of the zone, don‚Äôt engage if you can help it, or unless you have a big advantage.
---
Looted one today during mischief night.

Also wearing the witch outfit does not let you trade in caps for atomic shop points.
---
Just calling the online "bullies" out on their bs
---
Plus he is hilarious! Definitely one of the better additions to the game.  And he taught me about Rad Ant Lager which has saved my over-encumbered ass on more occasions than I can remember.
---
The game actually working + cosmetics that the playerbase would be interested in (aka not those trash weapon and armor skins for gear nobody uses), should be the allure, not a pay-for-fix subscription, how you can't see that paying to circumvent purposely annoying "features" instead of paying for actual content just leaves me baffled.
---
I seriously don't understand how you can't see this as an issue.
---
Not being a challenge is exactly the type of people they are looking for. If they wanted to be challenged they would be lurking for easy player kills.
---
Where's your link then?
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, Heavy Raider Plans are WAY too hard to find. I‚Äôm missing arms and legs, I know 2 ppl with them but they won‚Äôt sell them because they‚Äôre so hard to get, it‚Äôs maddening. I wish they would at least make them available from Raider vendor bots in the same fashion as Dense plans, where they show up very rarely in their inventory but at least they do appear if your lucky. Same with Healing Salve Mire recipe, 2500 hrs in I still haven‚Äôt found these?? How is that possible?? Also Deathclaw extra claw plan, plz make this drop from Deathclaws like it‚Äôs supposed to!!!
---
Sadly that doesn't matter at all. In fact, that's preferable. No risk.
---
Because even though it's late, I still enjoy the game.
---
I absolutely LOVE how you guys are so quick to accuse someone of lying for not posting a link, yet you never start off with one. 
---
Then , when the link is shared, it turns out the information was cherry picked.
---
So come grief me waiting
---
So close, yet so far
---
Oh man! This needs more upvotes!
---
It's a VOLUNTARY subscription. That's why it's not an issue. Until they lock the game or it's DLC behind the subscription, then it fails to become a big deal.
---
Inb4 everyone get's banned for singling out themselves.
---
Cool man, I'll look into it. I like posting on this sub because of the body count.
---
300ish. Don't regret that play time but also don't regret taking a break (maybe permanently depending on how Wastelanders plays out) either.
---
Only thing I regret is what Bethesda has become post Fallout 4. I expected better and I was proven wrong time and again.
---
I know you enjoy it but technically speaking game is in a bad shape. I hope they warned or maybe even fired some devs as this is getting out of hand with every patch adding new bugs and bringing old ones back.
---
I still don't understand: how is Outer Worlds related to Fallout universe? You could say "oh i'm so going to play GTAV/TESO after deleting this laggy 76" and it would be more logical. Outer Worlds is about space, it is neither post-apocalyptic, not about "World of the Tomorrow" divergent future.
---
P.S. I'm not saying Bethesda did well, i'm sick of this Gamebryo crap. But this pretentious statement about playing one certain game (not some other) is ridiculous.
---
Oh shit that's great
---
Watch out, you're gonna get buried around here for those thoughts. 76 continues to be broken, and has arguably got worse lately, but somehow this board has been hijacked by weirdly autocratic internet badasses with tiny... well, you see where this is going.
---
It baffles me. There's a strangely dedicated group of people on this board that act like YOU have the problem because Bethesda made a broken game and is now hustling everyone that's left, but you point out clear and obvious problems and need to die for it.
---
I'm not sure where the best place is to complain about 76, but it's not here, here has been captured by trolls, astrofurfers, and people that spent too much money on the game and won't accept how much they got burned. You may also notice that most of the more aggressive accounts have only been around for 1-2 weeks and are clearly some sort of shill/bot, like they've allegedly been playing 76 since Beta but JUST NOW decided to make an account to screw with everyone that complains about the game... seems legit...
---
Edit: New accounters
---
Or $12.99
---
If you don't get any bites here, try out the discord to the right. Still has some active players there.
---
Fair enough
---
the best kick is the crybabies still playing. I didn't like what Battlefield did, I stopped playing, left the groups. Bethesda or anyone else doesnt owe you anything, its all in your mind that you are important. 2nd best kick is you calling people thirsty yet, trying to interject your opinions on a post where someone was asking the people to back up their claims of griefing, which we all know is just internet tough talk, they arent attacking anyone unless they are sub 30 lvl. It's the only way the foodies can flex.
---
Dump them in containers at Whitespring station. I've picked up a lot of them there over the past couple of days.
---
Wish we had laws like this in America.  I'd love nothing more than to get my money back for Anthem; the biggest failure in gaming history.
---
Do you carry tons of ammo or chems? Are you going to use Power Armor a lot? Do you use stealth a ton? Do you use VATS much?
---
It works fine the first time, but if you try to rearm it, it works backwards i.e. transmits power and stops when you trigger it, and automatically triggers every time you login, so if you use flame traps like some of the cool builds I made it just destroys everything before you have a chance to change its settings again.
---
Jesus christ
---
About 450 hrs. No regret, except maybe not paying close enough attention to my character build. Im now at the point where Im having to swap special points between stats to actually optimize my character lol
---
Does anyone know the piano tune in Fallout 76 nuclear winter multiplayer waiting room vault?
---
Tl;dr: WAAAAAAAAAH! I'm a melodramatic poor!
---
I currently think there are more 1st players than there are plebians, and most quad tesla or BFFR scrubs are first players like myself.
---
Awesome.
---
Mileruk kings are probably the hardest creature in the game now....
---
Gaia* actually. If you expect them to speak out you me anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Ammo and aid yes. No PA, no stealth, no vats
---
You should of gotten a private server if you getting hit hard by lag. This is not a troll post but a serious one as its almost magical to see how responsive VATS and the game is in general when your solo or with a few bros.
---
I think its just because obsidian made the game
---
Those are bat farts 
---
At least I find it funnier to think the 2nd apocalypse was caused by flatulent spores
---
Crap.....
---
get an Unyielding set of armor (any level, +LCK is even better) then get your health under 25%, take a Day Tripper, eat a food with Luck (Oppossum jerky etc) then have Ammosmith and Super Duper. this should nearly trigger SD every 3-4 times u craft a set and you‚Äôll be swimming in ammo in no time.
---
Its false that being "only lvl 60" it s any kind of disadvantage.   At that point you can have all the perks you need and can use all the gear to dominate in pvp and pve.
---
Levels mean very little past 50.
---
Because Obsidian made New Vegas and the Outer Worlds (also made by them) is very similar to that in terms of gameplay and RPG systems
---
No, no. They are very specific. It would make much more sense for ballistic variety to be smaller and for shotgun shells varieties to exist.
---
I found rusty knuckles earlier today as a plan laying around.
---
Craft it yourself
---
1100. No, I don't. But I switched to Fallout 4 and came back only for Mischief Night. I want to create a new character but wont delete my current ones.
---
Checked recently and its passed 600hrs and yea I do kinda of regret buying this game on day one. So many hopes smashed from reasonable stash limits where small value items could be infinite while items like junk would have unlimited space but then every time I mentioned it this reddit it got shot down saying 33 items of junk is too much alone to store on servers and it was the dupers causing all the lag not that lag was due to a poorly made game that drops in half the frame rates when you start any kind of fight.
---
That would seem to make it even more tedious to have a million different kinds of ammo for everything
---
It works on many levels!
---
1070 hours I think.
---
There was no demand, and now they‚Äôre trying to make up for it by ripping off those poor suckers who stuck around.
---
I don't think it's shaming them, so much as it's a really shitty, low effort strawman. It's in the top 5 fanboy fallacies for justifying crappy prices.
---
On the contrary; a player base is what keeps people invested in the game. Even if half of the player base doesn't spend a dime, the other half the player base will keep paying if there is a community to go back to.
---
This is why so many MMO's end up going away after only a few years after launch; too many players leave, and the money-paying ones follow suit. This is why so many free-to-play MMO games keep producing content.
---
Game is cheap now, go buy it and try it out.
---
You need to list all the effects to get any kind of value estimate. 
---
A vampire's improved bash damage 250 dr while reloading lever is worth maybe 500 caps tops but a vamp/explosive/vats cost lever might be worth 10k+ to the right buyer.
---
I just asked the guy for an offer and that's the price he gave me, so I accepted.
---
I have a character who can cause over 13000 with a Stealth critical. But you know, it Is silly and unnecessary.
---
Dude if they're getting a refund for this digital slop, they probably won't be buying the game again just for Wastelanders. And that's if Wastelanders *isn't* ass. I mean we have the promises of what it will be, from the same people who lied about damn near everything else.
---
Also, I have no idea how much more fun I can have with my comparison. I had fun writing it.
---
Cool yeah I‚Äôve just managed to get mine to 4K
---
I thought that was part of the quest at first, lol. I was doing the fraternity nukashine quest and then it teleported me to a Scorched Beast just outside of Watoga after drinking the nukashine as part of the mission. I thought the game was just having a laugh, but quickly realized it had to be a glitch since it threw my level 12 character into a pit of baddies ranging from level 9 to level 31! Gulp! Had to fast travel to get out of there.
---
I didn't get stuck on a loading screen, I got teleported to an area where the enemies were 2x over my level. Gulp! üò≠
---
The whole *"You're poor lul"* thing was pretty funny the first time.
---
TL;DR: Don't pollute threads with your low-brow responses. Your hi-jinks aren't welcome here, Troll.
---
Same. Absolute minimal effort even on premium items. Bethesda really is pathetic. Indy companies with employees in the single digits do a more competent job.
---
Same as any commando build.  At most, add in chem fiend.
---
All the Commando perks maxed out, Tank Killer maxed out and concentrated fire maxed out. Some people prefer Ground Pounder instead of Tank Killer. Bloody mess in luck. Demolition expert maxed out in intelligence. As for the chems and Aid just simply look up an aid build. üëç that should do pretty well for a build based around that specific weapon and how you don't run stealth or VATS.
---
I'll go with rifles. I know rifles have the only range perk "Long shot"
---
Do u have a bloodied pipe revolver ?
---
No one thought that for real lol
---
LOL yeah. thats actually something I haven't considered. and considering the ultracite laser gat was built pre war, no telling how it got to be in the stomach of a queen, survived a battle large enough to kill the queen then was probably forcibly removed from her ...corpse, transported, used a bit more most likely, then put on a vendor for god knows how long before i bought it. no damn wonder its a bit finicky. that actually makes sense lore wise lol.
---
I'm not accusing you of lying, i just wanna hear your reasoning and being told to google is no reasoning.
---
I cannot share a link, since my estimate is based on guesswork because i cannot find a source, but i can explain my estimate:
---
The only info i can find is on Fo4: [(Source)](https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-the-fallout-4-development-team-2015-12?IR=T) wich says, that around 100 people worked 6 years on Fo4.
---
Assuming a Salary of \~100k per developer per year, you get 10 Million per Year, 60$ Million for the whole Development.
---
Regarding Marketing, Fo4 apparently spent 14$ million on TV Ads [(Source)](https://www.criticalhit.net/gaming/bethesda-spent-14-million-tv-ads-fallout-4/), so im assuming 30$ Million for Marketing in Total
---
So, with other costs of making the game, i say Fo4 cost about 90-110$ Million to make, i estimate.
---
Coming to Fo76, marketing cost ist probably about the same, probably a bit less, \~25$Million.
---
BUT, Fo76 was developed in a third of the time of Fo4, so only 20$Million IF 100 people worked on it, which i wouldnt be sure about, since the development effort of Fo76 is considerably less than Fo4.
---
So, adding it together, i estimate around 45-65 Million$
---
Also, level doesn't mean anything after level 50. You can have (and many people do) a level 60-80 character that is specifically tuned for PvP. 
---
There's no way to tell if you're tuned for PvP until after you're dead.
---
Somewhere over 1k hours and I kind of do, but I‚Äôd say that about any game. I could have spent those hours on a more productive hobby and I probably would‚Äôve been at least decent at it by now. I try to look at the bright side of it though, like how I didn‚Äôt spend those 1k+ hours in an actively harmful way, and maybe I‚Äôm just being hard on myself for playing video games as recreation. But I can‚Äôt shake that feeling that I could‚Äôve spent those hours doing literally anything else that‚Äôs productive, and I‚Äôd probably be happier having done so.
---
I did and they never replied ü§î
---
I am thinking this is just a rumour that caught on. I don't know of this actually happening to anyone. 
---
I've been running around flexin with the Ranger icon, in Ranger Armour doing the robot dance and nothing. 
---
The peasantry know their place. On PC.
---
Maybe! If I get an extra I'll message you
---
What? No!
---
What's next? A pile of gold with each log-in?
---
What part of post-apocalypse you don't get? It's just not safe to be in the wasteland. You want safety? Go to a vault (heh) or build some turrets.
---
Noo, living in a post-nuclear toxic wasteland and complaining about mobs attacking you camp. Come on
---
Yea, seeing the same thing here too, and more crashes than usual.
---
I've been playing twice every hour. I got the pirate hat ... Yay üôÑ
---
What the hell does your wife do for a living? Lol. $107/HR. Damn!
---
But for some reason it just works
---
Played since B.E.T.A but only have probably around 300 hours. I work 76 hours (haha) a week and find it increasingly difficult to dedicate time to the game. That's why I'm not too keen on these limited time events as I can go a week before I get to put some serious time into the game.
---
I really hope they make more content and dial in the aesthetic. The design is just all over the place, and never comes together in a coherent way. 
---
You just end up moving area to area inspired by other games.
---
Speaking as someone who knows nothing about the meta, I see two shot and explosive as super valuable as well. Vanguard, unyielding, and the other one that gives more defense the lower your health I also price a bit higher and theyll often sell. 
---
Also if something has multiple of these "good" prefixes that can really bump up this price!
---
Sell junk to the vendor not for 1 cap each. Collect everything you find and sell! I used melee weapons a lot until I leveled up to save on ammo. Check every container and body you come across for ammo and invest in lock picking perks.
---
820 hours. Level 199.
---
Been playing since December.  It was my first fallout game. I log in everyday.  There are times where I feel kinda bored but I realized it was because I was only going to the same like 4 places.  Once I started fast traveling less and exploring more, it feels like a new game. Plus I started playing NW more. Met alot of great people in game that I still play with. 
---
I totally do not regret it.  I've been gaming since super Nintendo and this is by far the most hours I've put into a game. 
---
Im just hoping WLs brings people back.  They've made a bunch of improvements. I just don't want the game to die yet.
---
Yeah! How dare some people decide to spend their hard earned money in a way you don't approve of! Don't they know? How they choose to spend their expendable income should be heavily influenced by what everyone else thinks!
---
And you people are calling Fallout 1st customers idiots....
---
Still bitter to this day
---
Agreed.
---
Looks like the mothman has you in his sights.
---
Completely agree, itd be great especially since turrets take up 5 or 10 percent of our build budget, also (dont know if this happens to anyone else) but the turret range Is inconsistent sometimes it can shoot crazy far but other times it cant shoot something a few feet away.
---
I do blame the player base as much as beth. stay with me on this logic train a sec. 
---
beth made it easy to dupe when creating the game. bad design on their part. 
---
most of us in the player base however did not exploit that. 
---
dupers did - while duping they destabilized servers. they flooded the market with tons of op broken weapons, they enabled pay to win by selling said duped weapons off site, that in turn broke pvp because without the right gear set up you cannot win against a properly geared pvper, that set up a rift between pvpers and pvers, even if the pvper is legit as a pver I assume that two shot exploding legacy laser rifle is duped, i also assume the pvper using it is a pay to win peice of crap. thats not fair to legit pvpers out there and causes resentment back at me, I get toxic pvpers get toxic and the rift ever widens. dupers and the player base did most of the damage. not beth. where is the uproar for them. the portion of the player base here screaming at beth should be screaming twice as hard at dupers and pay to win shitheads. 
---
seriously think about this a second, beth stopped making new "legacy" plasma gatlings because if its 2 shot exploding and has a split beam on it it will lag the crap out of the whole area, people still use them. ALL THE TIME, anyone old enough to play this game long enough to own one KNOWS they cause lag issues and why they are legacy. yet every other queen fight 4 or 5 morons will show up melt the queen in a few seconds, if the server dont crash immedietely it runs like crap from then on. 
---
thats not beth entirely thats idiots being idiots. beth should just delete those fuckers from the damn game. all that legacy crap needs to go. the peeps who would cry most about it are the pay to winners and the dupers selling them that hot garbage. yes beth has had screw up. but exploiters did the real damage.
---
I agree on a mechanics level, but I dont think itd make sense game-wise. 
---
I do hate how everything I have uses .45. And every shotgun uses "shotgun shells". Different gauges or whatever should definitely be added. 
---
I do really enjoy my railway rifle and ammo is pretty easy to make. But it is not common, and I can certainly see why
---
Jesus. Fucking. Christ. 
---
I‚Äôm so fucking sick of these dumbshit replies that apparently didn‚Äôt read the post at all. 
---
What do you think I‚Äôm saying?! No enemies should exist in the game?! No camp should ever be attacked?! In a post apocalyptic world do mutants magically materialize out of thin air in your fucking living room?! 
---
I‚Äôm saying nothing should SPAWN  **JUST AND ONLY INSIDE THE GREEN BUBBLE YOUR CAMP INHABITS**. 
---
Why is this so fucking hard to understand. In FO4 people constantly complained that ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of setting up a defensive perimeter when enemies will just spawn in my fucking bathroom‚Äù
---
Now, apparently, in FO76, it‚Äôs FUCKING CRUCIAL that enemies magically appear in your toilet every fucking time any fucking person walks within 10 miles of your camp. 
---
What the fuck ever dude.
---
good take the negative bitching to another games forum while your at it. good bye o/
---
Lol idk then man not my monkeys not my business he offers that price on him
---
Jesus. 
---
I just realized.... This IS the New Content. 
---
BGS are innovators. They're creating an in game war of factions, entirely driven by players. 
---
On one side : The over zealous, soap box preaching, holier than thou, "Consumers unite" types.... With their college kids who are stealing wifi from their neighbours to play 76 as human meat shields. 
---
And on the other : Some people who decided "Hmm. I'm okay with paying $10 a month for some stuff in a video game I enjoy"
---
Fucking brilliant Bethesda. Fucking Brilliant.
---
The fat man has good range and damage, but each shot weighs 12 pounds. I‚Äôd reccomend the hunting rifle, combat rifle, handmade rifle, lever action rifle, gauss rifle. I personally prefer short range mixed with the shotgun perk that cripples limbs, allowing me to get in close with a plasma flamer. The missile launcher also has decent range, and you can pair it with a targeting computer to not need to aim. The assault rifle is common and decent, but the handmade rifle uses the same ammo and is more effective, at the cost of being rarer. 
---
My advice to you is farm a few locations and keep all the ranged weapons, and tinker with the barrel and receiver mods to see what yields the best results for what you may want to build as a character
---
gator removal man. jump on em drag em out the pool I am sure your parents would approve :P
---
So what? New Vegas is far from PA-theme too. Fallout is not about RPG system or terms of gameplay. It is aboutpost-apocalypse. This is why this series is named "Fallout". If it is not about post-apocalypse ‚Äî it is not Fallout. I know that there is second meaning of this and it is "Aftermath". But Outer Worlds is not about all this. If you all wanted to play
---
&gt;terms of gameplay and RPG systems
---
you shouldn't expect that from MMO76. Either that or you just don't know what videogames are you playing.
---
My dad runs security for disney and my grandpa runs security for a huge mining company so i sure they would.
---
This is really cool! I'd love to see more with this theme of character characterization. I think it would be cool to do a house version as well with the Fallout Shelter Theme.
---
Yes. But if a friend is on the server you can ctrl+tab and respawn to them. But that's literally only command I could do. No map, no esc, nothing except the ctrl+tab.
---
How much you selling it for? /s
---
Nice job man! Looks fantastic!
---
Watch out we got a badass over here
---
I completely agree! I have said the same thing about the atomic shop items to my friends, we already paid for them in the atomic shop either with purchasing atoms or using atoms that we have acquired there are challenges and then said items take up budget. I feel that the cost should be a 1 to 3 or 1 to 4 of regular cost items that we have picked up plans for. Also, the walls, and roofs count towards so much of the budget, it is ridiculous. My budget was maxed when the greenhouse came out but I managed to get the fridge in to the budget. 
---
I have tweaked everything I can, such as lowering my second floor walls to single walls only to use less roof pieces (it cut my budget down by 6 pieces), I have a few power connectors running through walls, and a power line through the first floor to the second floor (with a trick that I've learned through a friend). I do not want to start over with a new CAMP (home) omg, it was so much work to get it how it is! I'm on PS, JAW-Droppurr if you wanna come visit.
---
All I see are complaints in this sub, and those defending beths practices being downvoted. But OK.
---
People trying to be edgy
---
Cool, so the ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do it is to render defensive perimeters and walls 100% useless because enemies will just materialize in your living room making your defenses completely useless. 
---
God damn...it‚Äôs like 8 hours after posting this and I‚Äôm so fucking sick of these replies. I feel like you all think I‚Äôm saying ‚ÄúCamps shouldn‚Äôt be attacked‚Äù when I‚Äôm actually saying attacks should have to come from outside the fucking camp. Outside the green bubble perimeter. You know, making there be a fucking point to building a defensive perimeter. I have no fucking clue why that‚Äôs so controversial to you fucking people.
---
Might take a while tho lol
---
I'm not appropriate with some of my names, and for some reason I named my first few with a B so all my power armor and legendary guns are named with a B now lol

If you get an unyielding set of Armor that‚Äôd be +3 Str when you meet the bonus criteria per piece, so +15 str right there. Plus with party boy, you should get +6str from whiskey, and psycho buff get an extra +3str, and XCell is +2 all stats, plus fury boosts melee, and glowing steak, and radical or whatever it‚Äôs called for +5more, you can get +31 str and at least a 10% boost to melee damage from the steak. And ninja can get you to I believe 3x sneak attack damage
---
Which equals to around more than 320% extra damage from your hits. Plus ninja, deal 960% more damage
---
(This may not work out, just used the stats of the in game mechanics to math it out, is highly likely that a build like this is impossible. If anyone could confirm it works, it‚Äôd be pretty sick)
---
some tips that may or may not help depending on what you may or may not already know. 
---
only one resource extractor per owned shop. in misc tab there is a fast travel mat put it right in front of the extractor. 
---
when stealthed/crouched  you do not show up on the map at all. so crouch before you fast travel in. 
---
you cant be hit outside the contest/build area. so put your defenses along the outside border and on your resource extractor. if you want to do defend events work the outside and let the mobs come to you. if you do have to go in deep stay crouched and get back out quick. 
---
an alternative is to not defend at all and just build the extractor and leave. let the mob take the shop. they wont hurt anything if no players are present but will still generate resources. this means to take the shop they have to clear it first which gives you a heads up.
---
and just as a general rule never go above budget and count the shop as lost as soon as you take it. when paying to build things the cost displays in green. that means the shop pays for it. if an item turns white. it means its coming from your junk stash not the shops. 
---
I go over budget sometimes to burn off extra but if I am low on gears for example I wont build turrets once the gears turn white. 
---
over all I take the shop -defend it - and then leave and go look for more of whatever i am gathering. its a good passive way of boosting income but your best source of anything is out in the world. except fusion cores, getting fullones can only be done at a power plant which is shit if you have a laser gat because theyre one of the worst pvp weapon types you can get lol. you "can" kill people with them but they're far from being optimal for it. as a laser gat gunner it is an annoying catch 22 I deal with on the daily. love the weapon for everything else in the game though so its my  favorite still.
---
Love your second edit, just hits the nail on the head! (Especially the floating base part lol) I‚Äôm so with you with this issue, I only build with pre existing structures, it‚Äôs the best. But those spawns are soooo annoying... can lock up my generator how I want, somehow it gets destroyed all the time.
---
I love all of these. Huge SN fan.
---
I would love to visit your camp but im on xbox. I am afraid of redoing my camp as it has evolved trough out the months to optimize the objects and feel of it, but im afraid that with wastelanders ill have to move from the Anchor farm..
---
I don't doubt it happened, because low levels of stupidity from people are nothing new to me, but i don't think it was more than handful of people.
---
It *was* rare before the event. Then Bethesda made it more common than the Single Action Ivory Grip plan.
---
My fiance had to name his underarmor that because he kept scrapping the Shielded Urban Scout Armor I made for him. -.- I have one more backup and then I told him he's on his own next time lol
---
Doesn‚Äôt the super mutant massacre cover that anyways? They usually drop around 3 each on a kill, right?
---
Solid work my good man.  You have my upvote
---
Difference is that i can directly benefit from defense events.  I don't benefit from pvp attacks
---
Furious speedy powerfist- "The Hammer"

My first initial reaction was to ask "so cool, would you be so kind to share the files" then I read the whole thing and realised I'd never end it. But I guess you could make some money by selling them since I haven't found decent ones up to now ( guess you know it since 3d printing is your job :D )
---
Also props on being sober. That's also something I can appreciate :)
---
Looks pretty good. Will give it a more thorough read tomorrow and comment back. Thanks for posting something different than salty FO1st stuff.
---
If you only played 30 min you don‚Äôt have a good impression of the overall gunplay.It‚Äôs about the same as Fallout if not better.
---
autistic kids die at a higher rate??
---
god they need survival mode back and a pvp free adventure mode. and yes usually I am the only guy on the server that has a friggin workshop now and the idiots always flock to it. morons, there is no reason for pvp in this game whatsoever. players lose resources just claiming my shop. no gains no loss no noble or conflicting causes to rally around. pvp is just a bunch of dickheads wanting to fuck up other peopls game day. period. there are no other reasons people can list that arent bullshit. just A holes being A holes bottom line.
---
How many atoms does this cost?
---
I get the desire to get to 50 so you can use any gear but spend some time enjoying the view.  Grinding isnt the goal
---
Single, drunk and no business being on reddit.  How the hell are you?! :-)
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
These are great suggestions, upvoted.
---
Frist put your game to the exception list inyour antivirus, if that doesn't work, try contacting whoever is managing your dorm's connections.
---
lol I can hear my grandpa now " hell yeah get it boy !"
---
It's not controversial. Us fucking people just understand how stupid that sounds for them to move spawn points for a camp.
---
&gt; but how is fallout 1st pay to win? It doesn‚Äôt really give anything that will make you ‚Äúwin‚Äù the game.
---
"Pay to win" doesn't mean literally win. It means you are paying real money for in game advantages over others who don't. In this case, you are getting unlimited scrap storage. That is a pretty big paid advantage because it removes a LOT from your regular stash and frees up al lot of space for more stuff that other people simply can't get otherwise.
---
I found the spawn point before and  cant loot it still
---
Lol. I have a feeling i might've ended up like that if i hadn't gotten cancer. But i know i could hear my sister yelling at me to jump in the nest.
---
Well not all of them are named after SPN stuff though haha
---
So it‚Äôs *better* that enemies just materialize already inside your base. That‚Äôs *better* than if they had to attack from outside?
---
Is that a quote? Or a bullshit explanation? If you were paid how fast can you make one?
---
I meant lower level new
---
Way to ruin the magic...
---
No, it‚Äôs exactly the opposite. People individually have problems, and somehow everyone blames *the game* rather than ask:
---
1. What‚Äôs your computer build look like?
---
2. What‚Äôs their ping to the server?
---
3. What else are you running in the background?
---
Yknow, the basic questions people ask anyone when they complain about game performance.
---
No, if anyone experiences performance issues, it‚Äôs because the game is broken garbage. That‚Äôs the only * possible* explanation, right? 
---
This game has a truckload of issues. But for fucks sake, it‚Äôs getting boring seeing the internet bitch brigade pile on this game day after day after day. 
---
I play, I don‚Äôt have ANY of the issues people seem to think are endemic to this game. I don‚Äôt get lag, I don‚Äôt get disconnects, I don‚Äôt get all of these other bugs people seem to see. (I do see bugs and issues, though. Just not game breaking shit.)
---
But if I say it runs fine, people pile on me and say ‚Äúoh, so because it‚Äôs fine for you everyone else is lying?‚Äù 
---
No, I‚Äôm saying that maybe we should use our critical thinking caps, and ask what else might be the cause of people‚Äôs problems beyond ‚Äúlol 76 sux‚Äù.
---
well only the half full one the half empty one is 400 atoms.
---
It is so cool ü§©
---
It's not "better" it's how spawn point programming works.
---
Someone the other day saying that the radio playing affects your stealth. üôÑ
---
I'd use [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f34ab8&amp;d=pg2po2ph2pp2pi2s01sb2es2c72ib4ic4a12a04a72l71li2lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=1cfe83&amp;nw=&amp;n=) build then. 
---
I included the Carnivore mutation so you could easily eat raw meat without disease chance as Speed Demon will make you hungry more often and might get annoying to stock normal food.
---
Dodgy should handle most of your damage reduction needs, if not take a point or 2 out of Lone Wanderer and Gunsmith and pick up 3/3 Blocker in Strength if find you're taking too much melee damage.
---
Your VATS will suck so don't even bother but you said you don't use it, plus Dodgy will keep your AP low anyways. You'll do crazy damage especially after you stack Adrenaline, cripple limbs, reload super fast and have good hip fire accuracy. You'll be able to carry hundreds of Stimpacks and damage chems of your choice and they'll last twice as long. You'll also be able to carry thousands of ammunition - 1000 rounds will weigh 1 lb.
---
Well god forbid it‚Äôs ever improved, let‚Äôs not just live with it, let‚Äôs actively defend the shitty, nonsensical system because... reasons or something.
---
Appreciate the in depth post, thanks man
---
He doesn't use VATS, no use for Concentrated Fire so he can get all the Commando perks, plus Ground Pounder AND Tank Killer.
---
Nah just stating what a rough tally I have kept track of what the paint and filament cost me, if I am doing as a job then I gotta factor in some sort of labor rate to make it worth my time over the other 3d print contracts I run on my farm. 
---
To match the same level of quality I did, probably would take me at least a year, I doubt anyone wants to wait that long--that being said I do make the files available to others if they want to print it on their own via a 3d modeling patreon I run.
---
Its happens so dude was kiting scorchbeats and whatnot to my camp to try and break things, but I have severe hording issues so I just kept repairing it for probably like 30 mins all the while doing the moth man emote then flashing the trade emote that shows cash lol.
---
I can enter ... I have no friends in Fallout 76 :(
---
Windows just released an update so make sure that aint running in the back ground , also for some reason I have to upload new video drivers after every crash. however ! once i get that done the game runs really well till windows releases a new up date. then the update causes a crash, then i have to go reload my video drivers lol. the game runs great for a week at a time for me.
---
My pleasure. I like optimizing builds. Let me know how it works out for you.
---
Part of this advice is incorrect, you can be hit and killed outside of the workshop.  I had taken Hemlock holes for acid and saw someone show up.   I ran outside of the build area while they were inside.  I stopped well after crossing the line and the attacker still killed me. 
---
Now, maybe the PvP area is bigger than the build area, or maybe the attacker can still kill you as long as they are within the workshop area, but you can be killed up to a distance 0outside of the workshop area.  
---
Best advice, learned the hard way, store all of your junk before going on a resource run, have stashes near each of the extractors, and store as soon as you grab it.  That way an attacker gets very little other than a few caps.
---
I got the non-moldy helmet edition for like $40 used on Amazon. I'd be livid if I dropped $200.
---
I feel the same way about the Nuka Cola Girl, which I guess, is still sploosh...Just with semen...
---
Yes. But without schrapnel an explosion is basically the same as a sonic attack.
---
Who said alcohol leads to bad decisions?
---
Damnit, looks like I got punked then. Not sure why is does a Sturdy chest piece have Heavy stats, but all I know is it's back to hunting for a *true* Heavy combat chest with reduced food and drink weights
---
Wish me luck!
---
I thought it meant orgasm considering Ray even mentions the male equivalent?
---
I am increasingly happy that Archer references exist even in this Wasteland.
---
Ha to be fair, I came close to losing my patience and sanity with this build lol :P
---
I deleted the game (fo76) off of my console last week after playing the game since BETA. 
---
I‚Äôd like to think they‚Äôre going to turn this around too. But that‚Äôs dumb/blind optimism.
---
Good luck wastelander! I spent a lot of time hopping player vendors trying to find heavy vanguard combat armor. Had to settle with a few 2* but I love the matching sets.
---
Explosive and sonic are basically the same. Without schrapnel an explosion creates a powerful sound wave. Hence sonic damage. If you want to get technical.
---
I gave up on big events and just play FO4 style in Appalachia. Still buggy, but not the torture session these huge events create.
---
^youreallyshouldbewearingprotectivegearinhere
---
real life vault-tec experiment.
---
Surgical Mask also works.  My first character was a nurse, I never had issues in the ash heap, though I feel like certain items provide limited protection since nothing but PA, gas masks and such work on the Grove spores in the Cranberry Bog.
---
I think what happened in your case was the pvp was initiated inside the zone then he chased you out with consent already enabled due to the fact you were in there for the initial engagement. when defending if you hover around the outside and drag the mobs out when pvpers show up to contest they cant shoot you. its also a benefit of having some defenses on the very outer edge so you know exactly where that line is. 
---
I should clarify though - I only did this science in one area at monongah power plant. at that specific location I was standing 1 foot over the line and my friend was shooting me from inside and failing. I am curious now and will test the outside borders all the way around the place when i get a chance. I am also curios if this event of yours happened recently or near the very beginning of that rule change. I conducted my initial experiments after the patch hit. I wonder if some things got shifted or changed in later updates. 
---
and yes 100% agree with stashing before going into the worskshop. If you dont stash and get whacked I dont even feel bad over the junk loss for you.
---
You nailed it dude
---
Don't forget night vision, super secret function that only works when vatsing enemies at night in the Mire.
---
 
---
&gt;No, it‚Äôs exactly the opposite. People individually have problems, and somehow everyone blames *the game* rather than ask:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;What‚Äôs your computer build look like?  
---
&gt;What‚Äôs their ping to the server?  
---
&gt;What else are you running in the background?
---
Not lagging - &gt; Event starts - &gt; Massive Lag. Yeah, it was probably his PC randomly losing the ability to run the game properly, and the event starting at the same time the lag started was probably just a coincidence.
---
&gt;I play, I don‚Äôt have ANY of the issues people seem to think are endemic to this game. I don‚Äôt get lag, I don‚Äôt get disconnects, I don‚Äôt get all of these other bugs people seem to see. (I do see bugs and issues, though. Just not game breaking shit.)  
---
&gt;But if I say it runs fine, people pile on me and say ‚Äúoh, so because it‚Äôs fine for you everyone else is lying?‚Äù
---
Well when you say "I don't have ANY of the issues", kinda seems like you're literally implying that its the individual's fault as opposed to the game itself, what else would you be implying? What bearing does the game running fine for you have on it not running fine for others? 
---
&gt; No, I‚Äôm saying that maybe we should use our critical thinking caps, and ask what else might be the cause of people‚Äôs problems beyond ‚Äúlol 76 sux‚Äù. 
---
IDK man, when a **single** one of my games continues to have issues, whilst no other game, despite having massively better graphics/etc has any issue and runs at 60fps fine with no crashes it's probably more than likely the one game's fault then my computer's don't ya think?
---
Now that it‚Äôs built, you can start spending money on food again
---
The blue screen is the reward
---
So pretty much you harass others who don‚Äôt agree with you? Sounds like some weird fascist authoritarian bullshit. I‚Äôd be scared to see what would happen if power was put into the hands of someone like you..
---
Most blame the game because to them, it seems the likely denominator for the problem. Let's say we play another online game, and it doesn't lag or crash. However, when we play Fallout 76, it lags and crashes.
---
So are we supposed to assume that our computer has problems despite being able to run another game smoothly? Or that the game that is crashing is the one with the issues?
---
Perhaps you should use your critical thinking cap to answer your own questions:
---
**1. What's their computer build like?**
---
\- Players are also crashing on consoles, [a recent thread here that you can read up on](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dq2c79/the_only_thing_bethesda_does_reliably_well_in/). Consoles have mostly standardized hardware. Hardware that the game is supposed to be able to run properly on.
---
\- Players who face problems with this game are likely not facing problems with other games. Otherwise, they'd be complaining about their lousy hardware on the respective hardware manufacturers' forums/sub-reddit instead of here.
---
**2. What's their ping to the server?**
---
\- And how do we check this? As far as I know, there are no in-game commands or buttons to check this. The only way is to do so via external software that one has to install, and no one should be expected to do so if the game itself does not provide a way for us to do it.
---
\- Even if their ping to a server is good, that does not necessarily guarantee low latency. Remember, there are other players in the same server, and there are no "ping restrictions" implemented in the game. So you can have great ping to a particular server, but other players that join your server via the friend's list may not, and thus their latency will affect you as well, because the server has to wait on their responses before broadcasting their interactions to the rest of the players. This is sometimes why you see players standing at your camp's vending machine, yet the map shows them somewhere else. Or when you see a player running stationary at a spot while not actually being there, or other instances of nearby players teleporting about.
---
**3. What else are you running in the background?**
---
\- While you can assume that someone that crashes runs 10 other applications at the same time, we can also assume that nothing is being run when they crashed.
---
\- So is the game coded in a way that you can only run the game itself, and nothing else? Is this an argument in favor of the game? I doubt it, especially in today's age where multi-tasking is the expected norm.
---
There are reasons why your so-called "internet bitch brigade" piles on this game daily. It is simply because this game has problems, and the sooner we get the developers to realize, admit, and address this by being vocal  about it to grab their attention, the better the game will be for us all.
---
Yes I know exactly what your referring to, your misunderstanding my point, instigating is a utility prefix that instead of having a full built player build revolve around it (weapon choice, perks armour) youuu make a crit Build, usually Junkies or bloodied and supplement in instigating Weapons where useful.. not make a full build around it just instigating Weapons, I know and understand there use, but they are not a ‚Äúbuild‚Äù in the way I am trying to portray my changes 
---
Just like a junkie or bloodied would use a vampires weapons when tanking a huge enemy a junkie will use a instigating Weapons to crit and oneshot singular targets.. which on the other note (bloodied don‚Äôt need too as they as just as good for this) which is why you don‚Äôt see instigating build but instead very powerful instigating Weapons
---
It‚Äôs been up since 8 pm EST but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone with it yet. Lots of people in lobbies grinding for it though!
---
Still doesn‚Äôt give people the right to be a jerks in a game.
---
So me, you, a Grognak costume and a bucket of chicken, what do you say?
---
Some people have one character, and they have crafting and weight reduction perks. Not everyone is optimized from the start.
---
It also doesnt take 5 minutes for whiny little bitches to come crying about a optional game charge.
---
Please tell me that you‚Äôre not worried about how other people spend their money.
---
People built their character around pvp and now have no use or outlet.
---
SB do it with me all the time
---
You died of Rad Worms.
---
1: It's my money, I'll spend it how I please. 
---
2: If you're still confused, see #1.
---
 Combat is actual trash in outer world's. And honestly I'm not really having that fun of a time with it. Not worth 60 imo
---
So you think its unimportant to be concerned about what people spend their money on? A very simple and naive perspective. Do you care, for example, if people are spending their money on illegal drugs? Do you realize that you live in a society where people's expenditures can affect you significantly? I care about what people spend their money on for many many reasons. In this case it concerns me because bethesda's business tactics are disgusting and I want people telling them that its disgusting by not opening their wallets.

Why are u worried about other people's money? Focus on yours and keep it moving.
---
It's just you guys are not as rational as we are.
---
If you really don't support the game, don't hang around, leave the community, and the game. However, I believe whoever is still ranting, still cares about the game. If you do care about the game, you should not make the community worse, and keep the game alive.
---
Falllout 1st now is a bad move, I did rant about it and got hundreds of upvotes but after calming down I'd at least wait until Wastelander comes out to make anymore judgements, afterall it's a free update that seems huge.
---
As for that lying thing frankly updates are free and fallout 1st isn't really P2W.
---
This is good! I could see a Fallout comic being illustrated in this type of color palette, especially if you digitize it and whatnot. Reminds me of the cardgames and stuff I played when I was little. Keep going, it's great! Draw more stuff in the style, experiment, see what works and doesn't.
---
Another very simplistic and naive perspective. Do you realize that we live in a society where people's expenditures affect you in a variety of ways?
---
The question wasn't if its your money or if you spend it how you please, so which question exactly are you answering?
---
Dude! That‚Äôs awesome!
---
You didn't answer any question I asked at all. Saying you're going to spend money how you want isn't a justification, its an assertion. Do you know what a justification is? Also pointing out Bethesda's disgusting business tactics isn't supposed to be cool, but that's a nice way to dismiss reasonable people making reasonable points. You keep saying you'll buy what you want. Obviously and I never claimed I could make you. I can certainly point out to you that you're supporting greedy, disgusting business practices.
---
Who is saying that its not their money? Nobody. You must not have understood.
---
Je lever called: drugs are good m'kay
---
Zenimax turned around ESO by eventually figuring out how to balance things and found a monetization model the players accept.
---
This game has been bethesdas opportunity to fund the patching of various bugs and limitations thst have plagued their games forever, and may lead to TES6, a future gamebryo release, having a much better PC experience, supporting things like ultra widescreen and frame rates above 60 out of the gate.
---
Also I don't care if bethesda takes a hit financially, I don't have stock in their company so I'm not motivated by their success but my access to their current and future games.
---
go to bed todd
---
As a Melee build myself I suggest heavy weapons. All the perks are in strength except stabalized which is a must if you use PA as well.
---
I love .50 cals and Gatling guns if you can find an Explosive one they don't lose much damage at range. IDK if it's a bug but it's nice.
---
Yiur on reddit, not youchube.
---
I agree with you on wastelanders. I also agree that shutting it down wouldn't be a good thing but I mainly think of 3 outcomes given the current situation : 
---
- they keep going the way they're going (broken promises, paywall with buggy content...) and the game likely slowly dies out;
---
- they put it on hold before doing any more irreversible damage to the trust of their fanbase;
---
- they mobilize time and money to fix the game and make it really worth it
---
This is also a known bug where if you die during and event end the respawn timer just ends but it doesn't let you use any button to respawn. You just lay there and the camera circles you and your shame.
---
Ive had the same problem...and if i stay on the map, theres nothing where my camp would have been. Meaning noone else has b uilt there, so idk why mine couldnt be placed
---
Yeah but OP's getting shit ideas from youtube and going on reddit to spread the current youtube lies.
---
that reads like intermittant connectivity issues. 
---
completely power down you ps4 unplug it even might as well get a full on cold restart. 
---
then go to your main internet box and shut completely down. 
---
then go make a cup of coffee. dont turn it right back on leave that shit down for a little while. 
---
the reason being if you hook it back up to fast dhcp will just put you right back on the same route with the same pathing and potentially even the same isp address. fuck all that 5 minutes. let it sit. 
---
power your isp hub/switch / magical internet box back up and let it establish then do the same for your ps4. it will probably be ok for you after that.
---
I swear it‚Äôs bugged I literally can‚Äôt do I‚Äôve tried over and over and over and over and over and over and over but it never works
---
Your spots probably getti more popular. Time to move. Haha
---
YOU don't get to tell me what I can and cannot spend my money on. I DON'T have to justify it to you for any reason. 
---
Now, you CAN hold whatever opinion you want about Bethesda. I'm cool with that, if you hate them, that's your opinion and you're entitled to it. 
---
I don't hate this game, I like playing it, I'll continue playing it, and I bought 1st for a year, because of shitposts like this one. And guess what? I'm pretty happy with my purchase.
---
like the game is tbagging you lol. thats rough. lookit your failure just look . right here. your failure lol.
---
&gt;How could this be a good use of your money?
---
It's thier money why would you care how I or anyone else spends thier money?
---
I like the new setting, I like the freshness in most of the creatures, I like the world, I like the players, I like what story bits there are to be found the world.
---
I don‚Äôt like the micro transactions, I don‚Äôt like the subs, I don‚Äôt like the lack of NPCs (but this is changing), I don‚Äôt like how Bethesda is treating its player base.
---
Bugs are Bethesda, they always have been and always will be, I can accept those even if irritating. Overall it‚Äôs not a bad game, but policy and disregard for people in generating alternate revenue streams has left a bitter taste, to the point I haven‚Äôt played for awhile.
---
Its a terrible deal that should have been incorporated as a free update, not behind a 100 dollar a year paywall. They can get away with it because people like you. It does affect me, everybody here seems to have a very self centered mentality. When people are willing to spend money on stuff like this, it encourages companies to do the same thing over and over again. Its called causality and the free market. People communicate with companies most notably via their wallets. No idea who this karen is.
---
I guess so but they‚Äôve been dropping like every 3rd go for me. I figured they were worthless I have so many.
---
All I get is the puking emote a lot...
---
Oh an some guy on my NW team asked me if I ever "actually *played* Fallout New Vegas"
---
Lol makes me say fuck this game, but still wait every hour for another chance at that god damn pirate costume
---
Fair enough, good you're proving them wrong :)
---
Who is telling you what you can and can't spend money on? I'm telling you what you SHOULD not spend money on. But also you bought fallout 1st because of posts like this? Now that's some sad spite money burning if I ever heard it.
---
 I have no control of what you can do. Nobody is forcing you to justify it but you're here like a broken record claiming that you don't have to justify it. I also don't hate Bethesda, I never said that, their current business tactics are disgraceful, that's all. But they can be disgraceful because of people like you who shell out for their terrible deal. Would you still be ok with a 1000 dollar a year multi tier system where you get unlimited storage, instant teleportation anywhere on the map and unlimited nukes?
---
The prefix must match the weapon. Instigating lever good, instigating 10mm, not good. But furious 10mm good, furious lever bad. Executioners, furious and vampires pair with automatics well. Stalkers, instigating are better on single shots. Two shot is best on close range guns (accuracy penalty).
---
Bloodied and junkies have the highest value paired with any of the useable weapons but even things like shovels have value.
---
Add explosive on weapons with some distance, as it can damage you too (now more so that tse shotguns got nerfed) but the go to for many will now be the faster fire rate on autos and 10% aiming damage on singles.
---
These pairings are what makes the difference between 1k pieces and 10k ones.
---
Holy shit people lol the poster isn‚Äôt upset about you spending your money
---
The poster is upset that what your spending your money on is negatively affecting them and everyone else in the gaming community lol 
---
Jeez people learn to read
---
Yeah I'm not completely self centered. If I buy from a company that uses child labor, that concerns me. I won't buy from that company. its sad you don't appreciate that.
---
God no lol.
---
Why I did play FO76 at launch. I'd I played for about 10-15h, and while I definitely didn't catch on, I didn't really mind the fact that they did an unusual game, especially since lots of players indeed seems to enjoy it. Instead of the existence of the game, I'm rather thinking about poor communication / monetization choices / real life products problems / broken promises when I'm thinking of what can damage the trust of Bethesda fans.
---
I didn't ask if you were spending money how you see fit. Also you're not a mind reader, you don't know what games I do or don't have.
---
How is it a terrible deal, though? You are saying that paying for a service after you bought the product should always be free. By that logic, I should be entitled to free phone service because I spent several hundred dollars on my phone. My cable should be free because I bought the television and the receiver for it. As far as video games go, running a continued service requires money to pay all the employees and to profit. And if you think that's greedy, every company in the works is guilty of that. I think the deal is great. From what I've read, the price is pretty much standard for private servers and they offer incentives with it.
---
Weird flex, but okay
---
I also noticed that on my old house I made a front porch out of roof pieces. It was ground level but NPCs couldn‚Äôt get on it.
---
A few reasons for me. I love Halloween and wanted to buy all of those shop items, so the included caps was the main driver. I also really like having the private server so I can play with friends and take workshops without getting killed a bunch (I‚Äôm not into pvp). I‚Äôm also someone who loves solo exploring and I get a lot of enjoyment out of looting everything in Fallout games, so the extra stash space was also big because micromanaging inventory wasn‚Äôt fun for me. The portable camp was a great add too, especially once I started using it.  I play 76 as a mostly single player game and only really interact with people at events and when I check their vendors. I‚Äôm not trying to be the best of the best and am not competing with anyone, so I feel like my first membership just gives me some extra nice to haves that make my single player experience a little smoother. 
---
While I‚Äôm not super excited to have yet another game sub, I figure I‚Äôll end up buying atoms anyway and there are other games I keep active subscriptions for that I play a lot more sporadically so it kind of evens out.
---
That's a big jump from a scrap box.
---
Wow seriously you are one of the only intelligent people here, I appreciate your comment. Thumbs Up.
---
Sorry. But how exactly is an optional service anti consumer?
---
I don‚Äôt see the big fuss about the fridge. It‚Äôs kinda cool but honestly the coolest thing about it is it looks like a fridge. The food still spoils. But now you can just forget about it a little longer before it spoils. The only major thing bad about it is the price is insanely high.
---
Btw, if you look at the most upvoted posts of the last month in the sub, they're anything but positive lol, so it's not a youtube bad reddit good problem
---
You must think a lot of yourself  if you think you can tell people what they should or shouldn‚Äôt spend money on.
---
Kinda makes a fella wonder. Don't it?
---
Its 2019. We lost the war okay. Look at GTA V, Apex legends, Madden. Literally almost every game is some how monetized further after purchase.
---
Fallout 1st is great for those who love the game and hardly affects those that dont. For those of us who dont play 30 games a year it's really not a big deal.
---
These threads are so tiring and honestly no one cares at all anymore. Your upset someone lied to you, a company no less. Get over it. 
---
I subscribed for a year and I'm really happy that I did. I hope enough people did to show them that this a game we want and is worth to keep investing in. I consider it a risk, the game may still go belly up just that's the last thing I want to see. If it does fail that sucks for me cause I really enjoy playing this game. But I've spent more at a bar on a night out and I'd be willing to bet most other bitching have also spent dumb money like that too.
---
No one cares. End rant.
---
I didn't buy it and I never will. I think it's dumb, and I think Bethesda tripped over their dick getting the service out there.
---
...but if someone else wants to buy Fallout First and I wanted to know why, I'd word my question with less condescension. It's a video game. There is no "good" use of money when the goal is to sit on your ass and stare at the screen, and nobody needs to justify anything. Go after Bethesda, not the consumers.
---
You are absolutely insane. Lol this sub shits on Bethesda EVERY chance it gets.
---
which also protects against scorchbeast blasts btw
---
man i love me a big wall of text.
---
It's only simplistic  and naive because it's different from your perspective, that's ignorance. I'll play this game with u. How does in game subscriptions affect you in variety of ways?
---
for the lulz üôÑ
---
Well if I wanted to solo I‚Äôd be playing fallout 4 or outer worlds
---
I feel like most naysayers are those who haven‚Äôt played Fallouts 76 first hand. They either look at reviews or watch crappy videos... I was one of them until E3 when they had the free demo... I played the whole week and then bought the game. Although I enjoy it. It gets boring when you don‚Äôt have someone else to play with. This might just be me though. Happy surviving the Wasteland
---
Class War that only flows one direction.
---
Those of us that bought FO 1st don't give a shit that those of you didn't.
---
Meanwhile, those of you that didn't REALLY fucking care that those of us did... for some inexplicable reason...
---
It‚Äôs still pay for convenience not pay to win
---
I was very against the concept when the announcement was made. The idea of Bethesda adding the subscription, however optional it is, felt awkward and money grabbing, especially since there's still so many QoL problems, glitches/bugs, etc.
---
... and then my weak-willed ass saw the Halloween bundle. I love holiday decorations.
---
It was cheaper to pay for a month's subscription just to have the atoms for the bundle. everything else was a nice bonus. I'm not going to lie and say I don't enjoy having the dance emotes and the ranger outfit, though. the mothman dance is cute.
---
(The infinite scrapebox, while extremely helpful, is something that should absolutely be available to everyone. So should the survival tent, frankly. )
---
But otherwise the value I got from my $14 isn't bad. I started playing the game in earnest a couple of months ago after I walked away from a disappointing beta/launch - and I'm actually having fun. I don't know if I'll keep the subscription another month, but it's been beneficial so far.
---
I always do. And it's nocturnal. Reduced ap during daytime, and you can only eat rad rats and moles. :o
---
I'm in NZ, ive compared the US price for fo1st converted to NZD, and the price charged on NZ's PSstore, and its like $4nzd more expensive. Its not much, and i wasnt considering buying it, but stupid that, just cause im out of the US, i have to pay more.
---
its pretty cool man..... but.....seriously your apt and you..... kinda look like a serial killer... get some sun, exercise , and go get laid with some sexy nerd at at a convention.
---
What you‚Äôve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
I would be lmao if I'd stumble on that. Quite creative, good work! Todd the god is pleased! Take care friend, I'm quite done trolling for the day.
---
Lol, what platform are you on?
---
Meh, Outerworlds is overrated. Outerworlds is like the random fling you have just to make your ex jealous. There's nothing really special about the flame, you just hope the idea of it bothers the ex. Lol jk. Outerworlds is a pretty good game too
---
Nvm, looked at your post history. You on now? I'll come help if you are.
---
Or just shoot me a message whenever, I've taken at least 5 others through this challenge, I'll make sure you get it completed.  GT is morningBTwould
---
I did it because I wanted to. The same reason anyone does anything.
---
2200+ , Lvl 533 . Pay off was worth the time, found a glitch where if you died in the Burrows by a 1,2,3* legendary ghoul you'd spawn out on the streets in Harper's Ferry....But when you re-entered and died and kept repeating this cycle about 10 times, when you finally kill that legendary ghoul you've been dying to they'd drop 10 pieces of legendary gear, was best to use this exploit on 3* legendaries....got addicted to all the God rolls,hundreds of weapons and armor pieces in just a few hours, btw...this exploit has been patched for quite some time. Don't waste your time trying... Have 8 mules packed with God rolls even as we speak. Set for life on 76.
---
sir, this is a Wendy's
---
Outer worlds is stated in several reviews to not be a fallout successor. One review called it a tyranny-like game. It feels fallout and Bioshock like to me. I prefer it over fallout 4, as base building isn't my jam, but in addition to the way Vats feels like a more Rpgification of an otherwise heavily skill based genre, outer worlds doesn't feature thst, playing more of the emphasis on the fps Gameplay.
---
That's all fine, but they scratch different itches.
---
Really? Funny how I see a lot of posts about people being targeted and others stating why they are targeting .... hmmmm ... \*shrugs\* o well, glad you got your opinion/amusement.
---
Literally getting a full refund from the ACCC, so jokes on you Bucko
---
Unusual boast, but let's toast!
---
Why do you care lol
---
You have saved a many noobs
---
Paragraphs pls. Not reading that.
---
Weird. Every single time I take the ammo factory I end up PvPing.
---
You don't play 76 you have no idea what's going on one way or the other
---
If any of you boys purchased in Australia then you need to contact the ACCC, the deadline posted is bullshit, you can complain RIGHT NOW! and get your money back, fuck 76
---
Haha except most of this happened outside (I live in a warm to hot climate) That is me tan, plus I make it out to the gym 3x a week to swim. The real question here is bro do you even lift? :P
---
Given  that I hit my 30s I will take that as a compliment lol
---
It's a different game now not perfect but significantly better than launch.
---
Yup I am the mold :P
---
But we could literally suck ass for fun and it wouldn't be a problem.
---
It's obvious you don't play 76. You watched a hate vid on youtube and then came here.
---
You would not be able to guess it but I intake about 2500 calories a day :P
---
Please... Keep this kind of sensationalist rhetoric to fanfic boards and third rate Fallout 76 Youtubers.
---
Having said that though, you forgot the option for both voiced and unvoiced protagonists.
---
Oh damn, another totally original ‚ÄòWhy do people play this game‚Äô, you ever thought that it‚Äôs probably because we want to? Because regardless of all the shit the game throws at us the part of the community that actually plays the game is one of the most kind communities I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
My bad, I‚Äôm hella tired rn
---
Technically speaking RDR2 is in bad shape..you'll find multiple posts a day about disconnection issues, one of the biggest issues in the game that has been around since day 1.
---
It‚Äôs interesting how you just can‚Äôt accept the fact that some people just like the game, flaws and all. Sure, there are zealots that defend it too much, but not everyone is a shill or a bot.
---
Alex, what is Billy Madison?
---
Don't forget the cannibal perk if used on 200 corpses in one day turns you into a Wendigo replete with tree climbing abilities.
---
This doesn't make a *ton* of caps, but: I like to loot Morgantown Airport and the medical center near Charleston for chems. Use Pharma Farma (Luck perk) to increase your chances of finding more chems. After you're done looting, put on Hard Bargin (Charisma perk) and sell whatever chems you don't use to the vendors. I only keep stims/rad-x/radaway on me and sell the rest - I've made some decent caps doing it. Give it a try!
---
I mean do we really wanna compare rdr2's and fo76's technical issues? Sure rdr2 has issues i heard that but man fo76 runs at 15 fps when there are 3 enemies around
---
Which begs the question of why anyone would get a refund for a game they plan on playing again in the near future..
---
Why do u feel the need to post this? Move on. If you not happy. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
no wars that I have seen just more active servers more firster loot boxes and more time in my private server not having to deal with toxic morons when i farm for fusion cores. AND my wife even started playing. begone rabblerouser thou art full of the poo poo.
---
Do you have evidence of this?
---
I‚Äôm not even playing f76 right now but these posts are so awful. If you don‚Äôt like the game don‚Äôt play it. I think borderlands 3 is a bad game that I regret buying (loved bl2),but I don‚Äôt attack people on the subreddit who enjoy it
---
Depends on the environment the child is in, I'd say. Of course, that goes for ***every*** child and not just autistic children.
---
My cousin in either high or medium functioning (I never really bothered to ask when we were kids because I just saw him as another person) and he never had any extra injuries over a "normal" child.
---
Yeah, this is what I meant by it.
---
You say that like 12 dollars is a relatively insignificant amount. The one thing I've learned from this sub is that 12 dollars is "whale" levels of spending.
---
no I am more and more inclined most of the drama surrounding 76 has been manufactured. competitors maybe. whats the opposite of a shill?
---
no lifting im too fat, i did 34 miles on my bike and thought my thighs were gonna start on fire or bleed today
---
I get the point you‚Äôre trying to make, but her wage as a software engineer is (hopefully) based on her skills as a software engineer and the profit value she generates for the company that employs her.  That doesn‚Äôt mean her hourly wage for quilting should be equivalent to her career salary.  That also shouldn‚Äôt be the determining factor of whether or not she spends her time quilting, or whether or not she can sell her items for a fair and reasonable price.
---
That explains a lot. I have getting slaughtered since last update and couldn't work out why.
---
Youtube is the really the first place I saw it, even before Reddit.
---
It's a non-issue in general. A few arseholes will and have targetted them but we treat them as we do all arsehole players - report and ban.
---
Let's hope Bethesda actually holds up their end.
---
Well.. this is a skill of trade.   
---
There is no direct rules on this. It is all up to buyers.  
---
I would give some general rules:  
---
\- Price should be one you are willing to pay for that gun.  
---
\- Don't count on other prices - they may be over or under.  
---
\- Once you are familiar with your products - you'll get prices right.  
---
\- If unsure put high price and start dropping price till someone buys it.  
---
\- There is always a new customer...
---
Not really u get much more lead and steel than gunpowder.
---
34 miles is awesome mate!
---
This fucking guy likes spending 144.00 bucks a year on a game.
---
Fast travel and hop world's to player vendors, you will find what you want but likely unmodded but super cheap.
---
im planning on quitting my job in spring of 2021 and riding from pueblo co to portland or, it might kill me, but at least i dont die at some shit job.
---
&gt; Those of us that bought FO 1st don't give a shit that those of you didn't. 
---
No, of course not. That's why you had to make this statement. You know, to let those people who don't have Fallout 1st know that no one gives a shit about them...
---
Because, and Outerworlds is not very good.
---
We can ya. Theres a big issue of player camps not spawning in. Player's created characters faces got randomly changed (for the worse) after a patch, daily streaks have been randomly resetting for people (Had a 40 some odd day streak reset randomly after the latest update)
---
Thorough review. A lot of people had a similar experience from what I've seen here. There's some merit to some parts of the game but it's all tainted with unnecessary and avoidable BS. It's a real shame.
---
I've done the same thing. I didn't want to just waste them by dropping them. So wasting them using my Gatling Laser
---
That's not what they said.
---
Nah just 100 here, 27 cents a day all day every day.
---
Your friend is a dipshit. Maybe start talking his ramblings with a grain of salt.
---
Looking gud bro üëåü§†
---
Loving the commitment! Seriously, great armor. Kudos!
---
Dude youtube is full of bandwagon haters. I hear you.
---
When you think about it, that‚Äôs a steal. Consider the money you‚Äôd have to spend at the cinema for an equally enjoyable experience for an equal amount of time. Let‚Äôs say the average subscriber and big fan of the game plays 500 hours in a year. For my local cinema in the cheap seats, 500 hours would be $3000 total minus snacks... vs $180 for a years subscription to fo76.
---
I hear ya, that is how I got into 3d printing and fabrication. Working dead end job, decided to do something completely different (make replica props from my favorite games) 5 years later I'm working full time doing crazy print projects for big clients and still able to make shit for myself.
---
Best of luck on the big ride and the job change!
---
If 27 cents a day makes me a whale then idk what to tell you man. It isn't the year 1880, 27 cents is couch money.
---
Cheers!
---
$20 is 13.333...% of $150. 15.38% of $130.
---
That's a significant portion that isn't something to just ignore.
---
that pretty awesome man ! keep on rockin those prints
---
Are you a low level? The experience you get winning is a lot more. Normally I get around 200-250 experience making it to the top ten and once I won without killing anyone and got about 600 experience
---
It's all relative, people are to consumed in the game to see prices elsewhere. I love it, I get great add ons and 16 dollars worth of atoms a month.
---
I bought fallout1st to be attacked
---
They sold you a broke game and they charge you to fix it and break the charged fix... But thats reasonable.
---
let kids keep dreaming.. their favorite youtuber said that there is mass targeting against 1st players so its only truth to those sheeps
---
"They can't be autistic if they're dead..."
---
\-Karen, apparently.
---
Straight away after the queen dies a scorched mob swarms her.
---
Xb1. Happens to me too but not very often. Don't open pipboy during action heavy event because that sometimes causes freeze
---
I can back them up I have a full heavy BOS combat armour. Good luck on your hunt
---
Furious
---
you should do the foot race with hordes of feral ghouls chasing you down
---
Xbox?
---
They steadily fixing and adding and I've played 700 hours, I'd say I've gotten my money's worth. If you hate it so much then try another game instead of letting anger build to the point of exploding on random people for saying they like a sub on a video game.
---
Innapropes....
---
Filthy Casuals have organized events like this. It's pretty cool.
---
I really liked the idea that it was *technically* a war because of that, but really it was a great way for people to have some pvp fun!
---
I do feel as tho random people punch me in the face less now, and that's a huge win!
---
Yup
---
Youtubers like legacykilla are a joke now. He used to report news, now it's just made up or horribly exaggerated 76 videos.
---
Not a great look for any company to have a regional government body demand you give refunds...
---
Im not mad i dont have any anger thats an opinion. I think your maybe projecting lol
---
You can have them for whatever you want to give, dextrouspick539. Loggin on now. I dropped a bunch of plans today, but still have a bunch more
---
I'm definitely grinding NW on xbox for it, already have most of the rewards except for the costume and pumpkin paint job for combat armor. It's a challenge I'm willing to spend time on since the tame is way more stable in NW than it is in adventure. Especially with the damned event.
---
Cause i enjoy the game. It helps to improve my patience level too with the non stop crashes. Not joking lol.
---
West Tek and Lucky Hole. I make 13k 556 every couple days.
---
Nah, I've stayed civil and calm throughout. I'm speaking in general. It stands though, if you're that unhappy then there are thousands of alternative games to play.
---
The outer worlds is a very good game. It can‚Äôt be compared to 76 as they are totally different games. 
---
If you are saying the outer worlds is not a good game simply out of spite, I seriously question your judgment. 
---
The outer worlds offers an experience that Bethesda has failed to produce since fallout 3. 
---
I understand do you don‚Äôt like the game, but in terms of quality and the time and effort that was clearly but into it, i would say it is vastly superior to the experience 76 provides in its current state. That could change with time, but I‚Äôm not counting on it.
---
Furious. Especially if you use vats. Two shot has far worst accuracy
---
Frickin rad! Thank you so much! 6000 sound okay? Want more?
---
this op reads like a back handed insult. or maybe you're a legit new player i am on the fence. 
---
1. at 2500 ish hours I have more than gotten my enjoyment out of the game and I paid full price. how much did I pay ? I am not sure because I don't notice anything under 100 bucks. I do know its worth far more than 20 bucks. 
---
2. its a big honking game yes the download file is a big honking download. no shit. 
---
3. the game renders just fine, if what your seeing is actually happening you need to fix crap on your end. 
---
4. there is an audio setting. map settings audio adjust according to taste. from the sounds of it your environment and effects are to high and your voice/ radio is to low. you'll have to tinker with it. 
---
5. fuck angry joe, he's a negative whiney douchebag who never plays any game long enough to even comprehend them, if he spent less time building props for his stupid skits and more time actually playing a game I might listen to him. over all though...nah fuck angry joe. 
---
6. agreed why the fuck they don't have the wanderer is a mystery to myself as well. 
---
7. the game has steadily improved since launch and most likely will continue to do so. 
---
I like it over all it has a fallout vibe that can only be found in a fallout game and it introduced new factors to my gameplay I had never even considered wanting. like a collectron, or movable camps, or mutations. that being said its often empty lonely, and your hand isnt held, it is definately not for everyone.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. Their complaints for other skins on weapons too. Laser rifle skins don't work on ultrasite lasers.
---
no im not targeted and neither is anyone else. these posts are really funny cause kiddies think they can somehow change what bethesda/zenimax does.
---
but if really wanna "target" me let me know. i hope you are going to do something else then giving some random emote cause that kind of targeting with "hello emote" we get on almost every player vendor.   
---
mayby you could capture all my workshops, kill me and steal my junk instead? oh wait to do that you need buy game first and i think spending money was THE PROBLEM in first place
---
I think you just analyzed this poor fella to Death
---
No, no. No spite. The plot is just incredibly thin. I haven't found any characters I actually care about. The combat is very basic. It looks gorgeous, but it's lacking beyond that.
---
That could also be your hard drive. Know with these creation engine games I've had stuff like that happen a lot quicker with an SSD.
---
As far as I can see you‚Äôre the only one throwing shit at me. You‚Äôre right, I AM entitled, entitled to make my own decisions and buy what I choose. I don‚Äôt really think I‚Äôm a prick though, I mean generally I‚Äôm a good person but since you‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm a prick we‚Äôll then I must be, so thank you for making me aware of that  (it‚Äôs a good thing you‚Äôre here ü•≥) A little tip for you, being an aggressive asshole won‚Äôt get you anywhere when trying to change peoples minds, you‚Äôll just rub people up the wrong way. I also find it interesting that you decided to come at me when I did exactly the same as the person I replied to on this thread (tried it out for a month because atoms). but I didn‚Äôt see any insults thrown their way. Weird.  Anyway I digress. Thank you for your blessing, I will indeed do wtf I want. This has been a pleasure as always, Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I wouldn't want to talk to these toxic assholes either. they get all the input they need from sales figures when it comes down to it.
---
I got a marsupial serum recipe and sell those to the vendor and players.
---
I run wes tek and huntersville a lot for legendaries. If I ever get any that are halfway decent I sell them for 1k to 6k in my shop. Even stuff that's worth more. I just like to move it. I tend to hit max caps every few days and then I buy ammo or lead.
---
the ones over 1K hours are the true elite players, goddamn i wish i had that much time
---
I agree the 21 rounds you get for the amount of steel/lead is amazingly bad.
---
I use a vampire's  LMG as my secondary at all times.  It's essentially a stimpack machine and an obliterate huge mob machine. My main is the gat which is dirt cheap to run, powerful, and very efficient with it's ammo. It does 80% of the work but I usually go to town in the lab section of WestTek with a variety of LMGs for the sheer fun of it. 
---
Also, the MG wastes bullets in the sense you shoot more than you need because the server can't keep up with the rate of damage. I've  unloaded bursts into a mutants face only to have the thing hit me after that and THEN litterally explode when the damage finally catches up on the server. You have to learn how to shoot in bursts and let up at the right moment and allow the damage to 'catch up'. Even then it chews through bullets.
---
It's a great game.
---
I actually got it thanks tho
---
Some letters plans are a reward for workshop related events. 
---
I remember buying my first ine from Grahm back when 10k caps were a big deal for me, thej getting awarded the same one almost immediately that day defending Poseidon.
---
I know i spent 10 bucks on this game and moved on i play rdr it also has issues but they dont charge us again for the fix and they usually give us stuff after its a true multi year game. I dont understand how people defend a company that just keeps sticking it to loyal players blows my mind people put up with that.
---
LOL yeah man! usually when Australia does something the rest of the world scrambles to follow suit.
---
I enjoyed rd2 as well. The story was amazing.
---
Well. If you bought the game and hadn't asked for a refund during that time, it is a little late. Newer players will be able to though, or should be able to at least
---
I think they use regional pricing instead of a flat exchange rate. Its pretty normal for companies to that. The buying power of money doesn't match the value quite often (e.g India). Political reasons can often be profitable to exploit (e.g Brexit). Or the thing your selling might have a different price sole to make it sell in that market (e.g China).
---
The plot may be thin at times, but the places you go and the people you meet along the way make up for it IMO. Just like every fallout game. 
---
The characters are actually very interesting if you take the time and pay attention and do their quest lines. Just like every fallout game. 
---
The combat is basic, but in comparison to fallout games it is much more fluid and does not have the annoying clunkiness that is present in 4 and 76. 
---
It is a gorgeous game with a lot of different environments, which is something you don‚Äôt really get from fallout games. It‚Äôs much more than just one ruined building to another with the same colorless backdrop. 
---
I would recommend you give it another shot, but this time with no comparisons or expecting it to play like a fallout game, because it is its own thing entirely. 
---
I think you‚Äôd be pleasantly surprised.
---
you can get them for free at the small workbenches in the forest. the food factory can drop them and that farm...cant remember its on the east coast. anyway you take those shops defend the first few waves and you get a random mix of plans. i got small letters on an alt goofing off yesterday from the farm defense. beckwith farm??
---
there is a damage glitch that happens sometimes. fast travel out of the area and back again and if that don't work log out and reload the game.
---
They're like Beetlejuice or Candyman. You have to say their name to get their attention. 
---
Either that or put in a report. Otherwise, much like an absentee parent, they're too busy dealing with reports to spend any quality time with you.
---
I'm fine btw. Life is great.
---
It's probably not the best build around, especially if you want to be pvp competitive, [but this is what I use.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c426c8c&amp;d=i12s12l71lt2id2sq2s32sr2ip2ls2a04lu2e00cu0cm0sg2c72pe2a12a72p10l30sy2s40sn0sm0se2ss2p00ep0pd0pk0pl0&amp;w=ek0pj0ll0ih2ib4cr0sb2sa2sv2ei0a80i92s22ii0l62l92pa0p80p90c52cv2c02i30i44ic4ij2i71ia0if2im1ik0i50iq2ie2in1il2ag2at1l02lm2i61p72p30p40a42l40l22c31s72ar2an2ah0la2lj2lf0ln0pf0em1ck0e60eq1eh1ew0er0ao0&amp;m=fi6ac92e1580d4&amp;nw=p0p7e3c8i0a2l4&amp;n=Draspian%27s)
---
Where I have more perks than it's possible it's because I exchange them based on which weapon I'm using, the Laser Garling or All Rise, so if you're not interested in two handed melees ignore them.
---
I concur with the others on furious, recoil is shit, accuracy is shit, and durability is shit with 2 shot. still better than a vanillia rifle but two shot isn't that great in my opinion.
---
if you time it right you can hip thrust them into submission :P
---
Sorry for the confusion man! The "signs and letters" plan is for the big neon lettering!
---
Yea online is getting better as well greifing is way down servers need work though next update hopefully it will all be fixed but these company's who knows. Its like aye take your pick on how we screw ya... Standard or deluxe edition.
---
Two shot is essentially just scrip these days, unless it has explosive. Even then it‚Äôs more of a fun gun.
---
Your second last paragraph is something I can agree with. Yet yknow, the entire internet seems to love comparing the two, calling it the fallout game Bethesda can't make, or the spiritual successor to it.
---
Don't even know if Obsidian is fine with the comparison. Know earlier in the year they weren't ok with it
---

How capitalistic is your country?
---
Does your country value customer rights or do they protect their businesses more?
---
For me in the UK, I'd never get a refund due to the last two, though regardless of that the first one would also stop me as I owned the game for a year.
---
Must be fun being so ignorant and anti consumer jesus lol
---
Someone did already say that
---
The M Kings dmg did get buffed at some point and since they dish out in poison it‚Äôs not a good development
---
I am also interested bin this.
---
Thanks for posting this, OP. I'm sorry you're getting insulted but I'm going to be laughing about "It's just that you guys aren't as rational as we are" for the next month.
---
Got it from the BoS vendor Phoenix at watoga. https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1250
---
Had to serverhop 30-60mins until he got it. (Idk if it was the hopping or just his normal offer rotation.)
---
lolz!
---
I know and it‚Äôs kind of unfair to both parties IMO. 
---
Obsidian made new Vegas as I‚Äôm sure you know, and I feel like no matter what project they release it will be compared to fallout until the end of time. 
---
The key to enjoying games I feel is to just let go of any pre conceived notion and just make your own opinion about it. 
---
Of course I could be wrong but that‚Äôs how I do it. Thank you for the good conversation by the way
---
Phenomenal labor of love. Did you use it for Halloween?
---
Damn I sold my spare fireman suit at my vendor for 10 c :/ feeling stupid af
---
Smart plan but come on about the class warfare thing. Don't dignify the griefers. They don't represent us non subscribers. They're just arseholes like they've always been.
---
yes please
---
a pve only adventure mode 
---
a survival mode
---
nuclear winter mode
---
that would sort all three factions out just fine. 
---
currently I use private server to do hardcore fusion core farming uninterrupted by dipshits so a pve only server isn't  absolutely necessary but it would be nice to run my powerplant AND see people. if not thats cool I am ok with where the game is now to be honest.
---
Are you really asking after the mods or the PR-peeps from Beth?
---
I went in expecting 76 to be somewhat of an experiment and don't cry about games.
---
there's no class wars just a few morons being loud here.
---
I accidentally made my mothman dance in front of others. I prepared for the hate.
---
But then the other two others joined with mothman and robo dance xD cute
---
Great to know! I'm now adding "check for defend missions" to my farming
---
Haha no, I'd rather be much more comfortable for Halloween (the armor is 85 lbs of misery that I can only realistically wear for about 1-2 hours before my shoulders beg for an amputation).
---
For the most part I built the armor for competitions and wearing them at convention booths where I can keep walking to a minimum (and have a base to rest)
---
I know haha it was a joke
---
Quite the contrary LEVEL does actually matter since every weapon in game has level locks. You can't use a level 50 weapon at level 5 as an example, against someone of a higher level than yourself. Most likely wielding stronger and level locked weaponry.
---
*after level 50.
---
LOL makes sense. wasteland, whole nation to rebuild.death around every corner, starvation and thirst always a risk.  "hey man lets start a running club"
---
I literally just stated such.
---
Really? Fuck that üòÇ Maybe the Devs could sort the game instead of making and selling more cosmetic, elitist shit.
---
And so did I originally.
---
I know I haven't really thought about it as a Fallout when playing through it, and no worries. People shouldn't be rude
---
What I had in mind was 2 different type of servers. 1 that's filled the people who actually play the game to enjoy it and another that's filled with all the angry war mongering raiders. Everyone would start in the good server and depending on their actions they may be sent to a bad server. For example of things that could get you into a bad server would be excessive killing of players, workshop war mongering, base destroying, or anything that can cause a bounty
---
You can buy it from the toy store in ws
---
This is definitely true, the tricky bits is balancing it against the cool creative corporate printing work I do full time (and pays massively well for a shorter project period (2-6 week lead times).
---
who cares about football get some coochie
---
Lol
---
I think your comparison is not completly right. If we stay with your donut comparison it would be more like this:
---
Someone wants to open a donut shop and advertises it as having jelly donuts. When it opnes it does not have a single jelly donut. SO you asks and he say I could sell you Jelly Donuts but they will cost you more. Anf after you pay for that they are not even able to make a good jelly donut.
---
WHAT THE FUCK
---
You're drunk, Todd.
---
Maybe I'll put some more time into it and see how it goes.
---
Ya...really not sure what her salary has to do with the value of her quilting/knitting skills.
---
Or... pkay something else while waiting for Wastelanders?
---
You should, and please let me know how it goes. I‚Äôd love to hear how the second go around goes. 
---
I did that with the Witcher 3 after not really getting into it the first time, and when I picked it up again it quite literally blew me away.
---
Don't do that man.  Poeple may hate on Bethesda but Blizzard is way worse.
---
Everything I would need during a battle is on my quick wheel. This is literally my only frustration right now is the going down right as an event ends
---
like a karma thing...sounds good but it also sounds complex. our servers already stumble around like newborn foals. nah. its a good idea but i think the server room would catch on fire.
---
Maybe if you removed yourself from the Devs arseholes and let that brown nose subside you‚Äôd see what the community was talking about.
---
Additionally 14 years in customer service management has prepared me for little tossers like you. The customer isn‚Äôt always right and the product is sometimes shit. Right now you aren‚Äôt right and the product isn‚Äôt great.
---
Lmao wow you're dense pal.
---
Kek, nerds are still playing this?
---
It was a preorder, so its been more than a year. problem is that the support team in bethesda simply flat out refused to refund when I tried to refund with the first round of people. I have not touched the game since they brought back old bugs with one of the patches and I don't intend to get back in again. Simply put the whole experience was just one of disappointment for me personally. 
---
I get that I probably won't get the refund but I suppose I'll treat this as school fees, lesson learnt.
---
When did Bethesda ever advertise a tent, private servers, and an extra junk stash for the original $60 game price?
---
You could upload to YouTube, then post the link
---
It‚Äôs all drama for the shitpostwrs. Pay it no mind.
---
Here's the example from the NZ consumer protection website.
---
"Devlin buys a new washing machine with a one-year manufacturer's warranty. He's careful to use it in line with the instructions. After 13 months, it breaks down. Even though the warranty has expired, Devlin can ask the retailer for free repairs under the Consumer Guarantees Act (CGA). Devlin contacts the retailer to explain the problem. He points out that the CGA says products must be of acceptable quality and last for a reasonable length of time. The retailer agrees to cover the cost of repairs."
---
What if it's 13 YEARS later? How is reasonable determined? My grandpa would think 13 years is reasonable for a washing machine warranty. Just curious how 'reasonable' is quantified.
---
Amazing work!  I especially love the 'wear and tear' look that you applied.
---
Fair enough, yea if it was a preorder then most likely you won't. Australia's ruling is actually more strange than anything but then again they have good customer protection there. The case failed in the EU and US. Though I believe there's still some ambulance chasers trying in the US. In the future, contact whatever organization deals with customer protection in your country when a American company says no to a refund. Its normal for businesses to say no there even if it goes against there laws. And dispute the contract you make buying a game, its your countries laws which actually matter with these things.
---
Never go pacifist. Haha, just don't be sparky.
---
&gt;I have yet to see another player that is apart of the 1st.
---
That's because barely anyone bought it. But there is a loud 4 or 5 person group of people on this sub that continue to claim that fallout 1st is a massive success and that almost all 76 players bought a subscription (despite no actual numbers or stats being posted by Bethesda to suggest this), and that anyone that didn't is a poor person or a child with an allowance.
---
Quite for life, any other games and hobbies, showering and skip meals. You'll get there in no time ;)
---
Thank you very much!
---
what the fuck ever you read like a teenage nerd evangelist trying to save people from hell. I have been playing it since beta happily. I know this. I am the customer, and I know damn well I am right.all the toxic bitches can suck it. the whole rage cycle is getting fucking old. ya fuckin tired man you're old, the rage sounds manufactured, fake, forced, laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame.  if you have been working 14 years in customer service that makes you at least 30 years old. what the fuck is a 30 plus year old coming onto a forum about a game they obviously don't like and complaining like a man child for. 
---
I too would like to see them squash bugs like the damage glitch - but as an ACTUAL  working adult I know they have to do more than just bug squash. they gotta pay bills, they have to push content. they have to please many factions at once the best they can. and you sire are not helping or usefull.
---
Wow, I didn't know that was happening/being said.... well I'm not homeless or a child with an allowance lol.. I don't have a strong enough group of players to consider buying it.
---
You need a minigun with this piece of art :0
---
Yea let's forget the arguement, pick on grammar like everyone is from English speaking countries, grow a pair, kid, the world is large.
---
Stashes don't always spawn from my experience. The guide may be good but you may need to server hop. I don't normally bother with looking for all of them but daily do the two at whitespring and the two at the mine behind whitespring Station. Various results on whether they spawn in.
---
First off I wasn't arguing or planning on arguing with you, I was making a statement. Secondly if you're going to type in English at least use proper grammar, doesn't matter where your from.
---
Bobbleheads are very welcome! Let me know when is a good time for you, if you're down. üëç
---
Sadly, the nice approach towards people in this regard is not possible, people need to be made aware that making stupid choices doesn't just effect them, but others as well. But since you have decided that you want to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution, so be it. Fuck solidarity, huh...
---
Lol wasn't trying to argue means there is no arguement, kids like you now has no brains but only know how to pick on grammar, pathetic.
---
&gt;kids like you now has no brains
---
There you go again with the child like grammar, yet you call me a kid haha. Just quit while you're ahead.
---
Maybe take that fallout first money and spend it on some English classes lol
---
Keep picking on grammar just shows how very immature you are lol
---
And your grammar just shows how very uneducated you are lol
---
The skull, horns and quills are used for crafting sheepsquatch weapons, and the fur provides some ballistic fiber.
---
Like at least more than a kid like you lmao.
---
I wear assassin's sentinel, FTW. Metas lame I don't do that stuff
---
Bro you're not even making sense, learn how to make a coherent sentence.
---
nope, don't mess my shit up with my rail spikes.
---
1873 , nope. Not one bit.
---
its alright keep making the effort lil guy you are really getting to me I am starting to get angry now come one you can do it I have faith lil troll you can do it.
---
ahh : )
---
I'll sell one set at a time if you want, nobody really comes to my camp because I have high walls and I lock the entrance usually.
---
Dude, first rule when facing trolls is don't call them out.
---
Just play along and enjoy.
---
5 bucks says you see him at Whitesprings station next week
---
I havent seen any of that . gotta call bullshit on this statement too.
---
12 bucks a month - which is 144 bucks.
---
Get it right
---
So the guy above me didn't just call me poor and a trumper? So i guess you're blind and you still can't form proper sentences.
---
ooooooh sic burn I am really starting to get furious now good job guy . you are so GOOD at this.
---
Good at what? I'm not trying to get a rise out of you my guy. But all you keep doing is replying to my comments in a hostile manner and calling me a troll. What's your issue? Lol seriously
---
Baaah
---
good read.. I was there too and I'm still here and I'm chipping in. preach brother!
---
I‚Äôm on xbox or I would be all over it! Lol. So it‚Äôs like, they have to make it in to get the deal! Maybe even become wanted!? That would be dope! Post back if someone hits you up and makes it in. I would for sure for a 10,000 cap item that‚Äôs 99% off. Just if someone gets thru they will yank all 4 just to flip them. But maybe 4 different people that actually NEED the outfit would really appreciate that. Very cool of you dude.
---
Also ignoring my question, nice one, changing the subject.
---
I completely agree. If the leak about further paywalled items is true then it might indicate the actualy high number of sales for Fallout 1st - which gives Bethesda a leeway to further monetize the game despite the PR backlash. Anything for money, right?
---
You are the peasant here
---
Probably behind another paywall.
---
Oh nice, yet another original post ranting about how shit the game is and how people are forking  money over to them. We get it you don‚Äôt like the game and you don‚Äôt like fallout 1st for the 90 millionth time for fucks sake.
---
Using ultracite on heavy guns without other receivers (like lmg and 50cal) is so worth it, you do a lot more dmg (less rounds per kill) and from just one flux you are getting 420 rounds on average (with perks).
---
Have you tried it? Because I know I personally respond much better to being spoken to like an actual person instead of insulted. You can put your point across without being so aggressive. The thing with people is that you can‚Äôt control what they do, you can try to make them come around to your way of thinking by presenting facts as to why you think you‚Äôre right and they‚Äôre wrong but you can‚Äôt make them do what you want them to. I know it‚Äôs frustrating but there are so many people who have signed up for this membership, attacking one person isn‚Äôt going to make any difference. So I stand by my original statement of people griefing members is bs. You‚Äôre basically saying ‚Äòyou‚Äôre doing something I don‚Äôt like so I‚Äôm going to harass you‚Äô and that‚Äôs not cool. Plus you don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre harassing. Could be a kid who has been bought it as a gift or something, but griefing is griefing so I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
There is a missing plan that doesn't drop: the empty pumpkin rack. You can see it in the build menu but the plan cannot be obtained. Looks like a bug, like Bethesda forgot to add it to the loot table.
---
Nah... it‚Äôs all hype...
---
This is the dumbest comment I've ever read.
---
Oh I forgot to mention get rid of the damage cap, that was the execution of survival mode imo.
---
They need to pitch it as a more hardcore pvp experience, manage player expectation. If you go in here you will die, if you have maxed through hiker and other similar perks people will use your corpse like a fleshlight.
---
That would hopefully stop the whining as its right on the tin. An anyway, they have thier private sessions so they can completely shield themselves from any adverse player interaction ever.
---
Deserved targeting. Go play on your private server.
---
Rather than a guide, there's a map that has cap stash locations marked on it. 
---
[https://map76.com](https://map76.com)
---
Just look for it there.
---
I have an Xbox One S and my base renders and loads within 5 seconds of joining the game.
---
I can use some more junk also. I have TONS OF JUNK SPACE since you are leaving.
---
Deep breaths now. There is no such thing as a civil war. No need to unplug vendors :) It‚Äôs just a few emotional kids who got carried away. There will always be assholes and griefers in a game like this. Keep calm and rebuild Appalachia.
---
I imagined the dark tower from the gunslinger novels.
---
Actually I don't even know how they can grief you , just keep some nuka mines and stuff straight from our infinite junk stash and grief them back.
---
Got a nice 3 star legendary yesterday and the game crashed right after I looted it. I still have to log in to see if I kept it.
---
Hey, I might be wrong but I don't think you can tame set spawn creatures.
---
Urg, I know what you mean. I kept failing over and I over. Then I found that if you stay crouched when you aren‚Äôt swimming it works. Go figure.
---
Also a dupers only server, dont ban them, just disable their abilities to play or trade with normal players.
---
I actually seen this on someone's camp wall. And I was like, where the hell did that come from???
---
Now my questions have been answered.
---
The full title of the first game was Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Role-Playing Game. The series has always been about RPG gameplay with a PA backdrop for commentary on human nature.
---
No, you complete it by performing three objectives from the list and you get 10 atoms.
---
You can complete multiple objectives at once though.
---
I'll wear one for my wedding
---
Like the other redditor wrote, you'll get 30. One challenge doesn't exclude any other challenge.
---
Instead of blocking them, why not fight them?  Your generation needs to stand up for themselves instead of taking the easy way out all the time.
---
Thanks, and obviously I cant be blind or I wouldn't be able to read your hilarious failure at trolling. like is this the one thing you're supposed to be good at? I mean if this is it.... you're just fucked at life buddy.
---
Furious. 2 shots not worth it. Poor accuracy
---
I've taken photos of people welding fire hydrant bats.  Gosh I want one, but I'm pretty certain it will never be obtainable by non-cheater means.
---
Todd can eat my hairy ass before I consider Fallout 1st
---
riiiiiiight because defending your workshop in your excavator armor vs a fully perked out pvp in full on pay to win ass sent gear is the smart tough and brave thing to do. yeeeeeeah we will get right on that because we are that fucking stupid and easily manipulated.
---
Ok boomer.
---
EDIT: Look at this guys fucking post history. Straight up idiot. Posts stating "If I want to call someone from Japan a "Jap" then I fucking will and none of you inbred SJW fucktards can do anything about it"
---
Whatever i name them i put ‚ÄòZz‚Äô in front of the name to push my items at the very bottom of the list, it makes selling and scraping so much easier and faster.
---
&gt; Is hacking really that rampant? 
---
If PC, yes. If not, probably just skilled player.
---
Yawn.
---
Is acussing me of being a troll all your supposed to be good at? Because it seems you're also good at not having a life. And I mean if it is... you're just fucked for life buddy.
---
LOL are you seriously an anti firster accusing beth of pay to win . wheres the anger for the dupers and fuckers selling duped legacy god guns and armor at?? huh wheres the anger over that. hypocrit.
---
Your perception. 
---
I see it as people are voicing their displeasure with Bethesda. As I said, let the reps report that they are getting downvoted. If you are against that strategy, you can upvote them. Let's see how it goes.
---
lol you had to copy paste my own sentance and reword it because youre to dumb to think of your own come back LOLOLOLOL ooooh you totally lose this round scrub go read some books . maybe a grammer book so you can be an annoying ass grammer nazi better.
---
Its not even worth it. Getting breathed on by enemies instantly kills me
---
Dupers were punished. But you bootlickers are telling  Bethesda you'll eat their shit up as long as you have to pay for it.
---
Class war stuff sounds pretty stupid tbh, but some people here are starting to sound like people when they defend trump. 
---
&gt; most of the drama surrounding 76 has been manufactured. competitors maybe.
---
WTF
---
Ohhh, since they can dupe and build in NW, could it be someone building a camp in an underground glitch? Like how they do in adventure mode? Maybe the flames dont get to them if theyre hanging underground?
---
Yeah... how do I say this without being a complete asshole. You sound like a complete sperg, first you went from calling me a troll, then typing incoherent sentences with terrible grammar, now your the one telling me to read a book? Your insults if you can even call them that (childish attempts rather) have been all over the place. You've done nothing to make a good point about fallout first and have just made a complete ass of yourself on this thread. I actually feel embarrased for you. Here's an upvote you pathetic person lol.
---
no they werent. barely if any were caught. no anti dupe measures. wheres your rage at for those assholes that flooded the market with god tier pvp gear and completely broke pvp for everyone. also you wanna complain about server stability but are you gonna acknowledge the shitbags causing the server instability with dupe methods that involve intentionally crashing the server? now what your here to whine at bethesda because they offer a product that lets me get away from those said peice of shit pay to win pvpers who bought the broken ass pvp weapons from the asstains of humanity that are dupers? that it ? you got skin in the game boy, you sell that shit and dont like the fact bethesda sold a way away from that toxic garbage? come hypocrit wheres the rage for the dupers that caused more damage than anything beth ever did?
---
PC NW is literally infested with hackers; as is PC market with dupers and RMTers.
---
Bethesda doesn't say neither does anything impactful.
---
It was PC.
---
No one dared you.
---
&gt;Fallout 1st subscriptions continue to exceed expectations
---
you cant say anything without being a complete asshole. &lt;--that's a score right there. I like that one. 
---
I already kicked your ass verbally 6 ways from sunday and you fucking know it. see you round keep practicing. maybe do something original instead of copying the old attack the grammar routine.
---
Well I just have the glowing skelly suit left...then I'm done with NW until the next set of items...
---
I really hate the new map...I want the old one back. Then at least I had a chance at living for more then 10 seconds (excluding when hackers are involved).
---
Lovely...
---
Hacker then. 
---
Good luck getting a response. Bethesda has been an absentee landlord when it comes to dealing with NW hackers.
---
shit drag the fucker right on top of an afker and stealthboi bud. he will tank for you for a minute.
---
I mean you do have poor grammar, that's just a fact. It's hard to have a conversation with someone that can't express themselves in a coherent manner.
---
I'm doing fine you get your point across enough to make me bored but i cant say I have trouble understanding you.
---
Keep in mind every stash has only 25% chance to spawn in the world
---
Do you mean you **can't** or **can** complete multiple objectives at once?
---
You're both toxic
---
If you have an issue with Public worlds, why don't you go sit in your paid for safe space? Maybe Thirst players should only get put into servers with other thirst players. That's one way to solve it...Otherwise ignore my emote and deal with the rest of us knowing you needed to play sandbox mode like a child.
---
Ok I might be not clear at the start, I meant no you do not get atoms repeatly. You complete the challenge by completing 3 of the listed objectives, an only 10 atoms is awarded for completing the challenge. Multiple objectives can be completed at once so you do not need to level up 3 times.
---
F1 is a real game changer, is it worth the money depends on your budget. I have it and I‚Äôm very happy for me it was the best update in last couple months (I wish it will be possible to get all of that for free, but it‚Äôs clearly not)
---
I know right. who knew that stupid second tent would be so awesome. I use it when I am heavy but cant find a work bench to scrap with near buy. I use it to get rest bonuses,. 
---
private server is friggin awesome to I get to farm all three powerplants without worrying about hogging it from other players or getting attacked by a douche bag. its great.
---
Y tho? 76 sux hur, hur.
---
That's not costing anyone real money.. that's not being a shitty consumer it's being a shitty player. You can't just throw hypocrite around.
---
uhm ok stop reading or block us then. simple fix for you right there.
---
Yesterday i punished everyone by killing the end boss from the Halloween event in one hit. I aint gonna do the whole thing alone so everyone else can get a piece of the cake, MY CAKE!
---
Why do people keep making shit posts about things that don‚Äôt care about?
---
The aniamatronic santy clause one of my teammates duped in NW looked kind of cool.
---
Why would a junkie or bloody character use a vampiric weapon? Offensive capability is a large part of the build‚Äôs defense.  
---
I can‚Äôt think of any example where event participants would want to keep a boss alive, at least one that can actually hurt you and might warrant extra healing power.  Against anything I can think of, I‚Äôll stick with a bloody rifle. Dead enemies don‚Äôt shoot or bite.
---
A lot of people would hate that and say let everyone get a tag. Well I‚Äôm glad when someone 1 shots it, as I‚Äôm not bothered about a 1 star and just want the event to end. I‚Äôm not a bloody build so I can‚Äôt 1 shot it but can kill it quite quickly. It‚Äôs just with all the other robots swarming you that makes it harder. But these players today realised that a 1 star isn‚Äôt worth the hassle of someone else is going to kill it.
---
People that never played f76 seems to care the most about f1 subscription because logic
---
It's not so I can fix it, it's so you can fix it. It seemed like you might not be aware.
---
yes I can , and yeah it does cost people real money, approximately 3 buckss for a duped plasma laser gat, google it. right fucking now I havent even looked google a 2 shot exploding plasma gatling and tell me the cost. hang on I will. BOOM 35.00 search "two shot plasma laser gatling buy"
---
now. you hypocrites want to yell at beth for charging me a little bit of money for my own private server, you want to yell at me a firster for spending my fucking money on something thats totally not your business, you got to have some skin in that game to even fake all this outrage. are you mad cause youre selling it, are you mad cause you bought it and I aint gonna be there? huh?
---
I don‚Äôt agree with people getting stuff from the dev room, but how could beth ban the player who simply bought it??
---
i started posting because it was nothing but negative bullshit for weeks and weeks. no. someone has to counter point and argue back . fuck those douchebags. mods sure as fuck arent shutting them down.
---
Reason people do this is because the EVENT ITSELF is so laggy that you legit can't even do anything without crashing. If you don't like that, well, that sucks. Damned if you do. Damned if you don't.
---
AAANNNTTTSSS
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
Even better, how about adding plans for "Wired floors" and "wired walls", sticking an extra Copper cost in there, so that we can have homes without wires strung all over the place but, instead, we've gona all pre-apocolypse and wired things up properly as we rebuilt them.
---
It was a feature that we had in Fallout 4's Vault pieces, which were wired and when placed together would share power, but we could do it fine with the wooden foundations, for example, and some kind of new, more expensive, "Modern house" plan alongside Barn and metal shack and whatnot.
---
I'd be ever so grateful and I know I'd not be the only one.
---
It's up to us to rebuild Appalachia, and getting houses up to code is just one part of that.
---
Based on your approach, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs been a while since you got a promotion at your customer service job.
---
The level up dailies are a single challenge worth 10 Atoms that requires to to complete any of the 3 options.
---
You can complete any of the three individually or as a group
---
In the end, it‚Äôs only a single 10 Atom reward
---
‚Ä¶ there are legendary versions of armor other than light?
---
All I've ever seen are standard combat, leather, wood, metal, or robot, never a sturdy or Heavy of any.
---
I can make *any* of 'em, but...
---
Man.
---
I had no idea.
---
an anti pvp public server away from peice of crap pay to win pvp garbage is a perfect idea. ass sentinal vanguard chest peice 12 bucks online. all pvpers are trash hope to god we get pvp free public adventure mode next. I gladly pay 12 bucks a month to get away from those asshats. the more you troll and talk trash about firsters the happier I am that I bought it.
---
Thx for trying to help :)
---
It doesn't say complete three it says  (**YES IT DOES I AM BLIND - Sorry**)
---
"Level up while" then it has a drop down list. I know if I do ONE I get 10 Atoms
---
God no! I left customer services years ago. Sadly the majority of humanity lives inside a pair of privileged blinkers. Nice try though. I‚Äôve moved onto better things because, luckily, I have a great skill set.
---
Thanks for trying though sonny.
---
That‚Äôs amazing
---
I am blind &amp; very sorry. I never noticed the 3
---
The dragon but it takes 10 seconds to reload, as you are melee i will recommend 50cal or lmg
---
I have this problem with anything that does damage many times in short periods (shotguns or high ROF)
---
I think basically the server can't process you hitting say 9 times in one server tick so your client is like "I dealt this much damage" and the server goes "nuh uh I only saw you hit once" and the server overrides the health back
---
The BOS vendor at the whiteseping sells it. If its not there, just server hop.
---
also when they made them semi permanent they brok a lot of the old guides locations and added some ne one. I knew morgan train like the back of my hand pre patch afterwords its just. well its all jacked up.
---
That‚Äôs all I want on top of an amazing DLC, we‚Äôve had Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter that was already ripe for trophies like completing the imposter sheepsquatch event or reaching levels 10, 25 and 50 in Nuclear Winter.. so after being absolutely deprived of objectives outside of the game (trophies) there has to be some for Wastelanders like reaching maximum affinity with either faction, completing the dlc, meeting the overseer, obtaining the treasure from Vault 79.. so much to give in regards to trophies
---
I can‚Äôt comment on your other skills, but I‚Äôd steer clear of situations where a charisma check is needed.
---
Their community? I thought the fans managed it because they couldn‚Äôt
---
Yeah I'm one of those people who doesn't move around after the event starts cause if I move, I'll crash. Not gonna apologize for wanting to stay in an event that was placed in an already really buggy, laggy area that has now been made worse by constant explosions and automatic laser weapons
---
Best attempt Ive seen yet!
---
You sound like you're surrounded with friends.
---
How about trying to be less of a cunt in life?
---
Many non-duppers hate the duppers. You notice less hate because it's not easy to spot a dupper as it is to spot a FO1STer.
---
Anyway, I wouldn't hunt any of those, even disliking of both did. The current witch hunt only makes things worse, because when griefers rise, the *private* server feature increase its value - more people buy it.
---
I support this because they spawn under my camp and I cant kill them anyway.
---
Yeah I basically never come here because it‚Äôs full of whiny internet outrage weirdos. No idea how any of the complainers can act like martyrs.
---
I mean....I park my alt account at the event conclusion area while I play my main account through the event.
---
..........unless I'm busy and use hair ties on my xbox controller thumb sticks to have them both walk crouched in circles above the balcony entrance &gt;.&gt;
---
I‚Äôm only a 1st subscriber for the outfit.. I don‚Äôt agree with how it‚Äôs been handled so I don‚Äôt use the other features but to each their own you know? It‚Äôll blow over one way or another
---
It's a lot of money for some non-us countries.
---
I just assumed that everyone who was actually bothered by fo1st stopped playing, you know, vote with your wallets and what not
---
Where is it from then? How do you know it's from Wastelanders? Bit of context would help here.
---
Did your caps lock button break when you hulk smashed your key board there bud?
---
you should sell this bro 
---
then sell paper bags on the side
---
But you expect someone else to complete it and risk crashing to get the rewards. Yes it‚Äôs a bit laggy but I‚Äôve only crashed twice and I‚Äôve done the event loads of times.
---
The event is so laggy. I‚Äôve been disconnected too many times at the end so I just find a cozy spot to wait for it to end. It‚Äôs not intentional, just tired of getting to the end to be disconnected or frozen and not get anything. I‚Äôll shoot from afar but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm gonna do. That 1* at the end just gives 5 scrip anyway so I could care less if I ‚Äútag‚Äù it.
---
I remember way back when...it used to be Level Up Once and you got 10 atoms....then they started putting stipulations on how you leveled up.
---
Dude chill out the ppl here your the one agro as fuck. 
---
&gt;now. you hypocrites want to yell at beth for charging me a little bit of money for my own private server, you want to yell at me a firster for spending my fucking money on something thats totally not your business, you got to have some skin in that game to even fake all this outrage. are you mad cause youre selling it, are you mad cause you bought it and I aint gonna be there? huh?
---
Here are the real colours how you change your tune. Big difference that bud and if you feel it's the same yes in the term that it's your money and you do with it whatever the hell you want but it's not the same, as one is a glitch that BGS has failed miserably to stop, and the second is something BGS brought out to charge you. Ultimately its your choice to use your money on both.
---
But if you really want to be angry at someone it should be yourself that knowing the dupe problem to just mention one ( the list here is huge) and yet still give them more money?
---
And then you are so angry at everyone becuase there is no out rage about dupping, where were you 10 months ago? I bet you can find countless post if you make a simple search here. 
---
But keep showing your colours, have a good day üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
There's always plenty of people at the event that it always gets finished with plenty of time to spare, so that's irrelevant to bring up. If I notice that there's other people who are also just sitting still like me, and not a lot of people doing stuff, I'll move slowly and help out...then I crash and miss out on the event rewards. So, yeah, I'm gonna keep sitting still
---
Two shot might edge out Furious for damage in a mathematical paper scenario, but practically it‚Äôs just terrible.  Bad accuracy and higher durability degradation are the big disadvantages, but the way the damage is split between the two projectiles means you‚Äôll take a net loss in DPS vs a vanilla gun when enemies are further than point blank range or moving laterally. If only one bullet hits, that‚Äôs about 60% of what a single normal bullet would do.  If you fight a lot of barns, two shot is fantastic.
---
Furious is better in nearly every situation you‚Äôll be in, and in terms of maintenance costs.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre joking on the 2nd part, lol. Fair enough if you actually do something while your alt is there but to just hang around and let someone else do it. I don‚Äôt like that.
---
lol no it's just drama
---
1600+ hours, and no regrets. I'm working a 30 hour job, late shifts, so I can play all night.
---
Just the horns and quills are used for weapons. The skull only breaks down to bone, it‚Äôs not used in crafting any weapons
---
Mods have stated multiple times they agree with the backlash Bethesda are being for being thieving lying arseholes.
---
On a side note, you're not trying to
---
\&gt;argue back 
---
when you say things like 
---
\&gt; fuck those douchebags 
---
If you've got an argument that isn't "waah make me pay more", give us legitimate points and we'll talk to you like you're above the age of 10.
---
If everyone took that attitude then it would always fail.  To be fair that‚Äôs the first time no one else hasn‚Äôt helped out. It started off good but once it moved onto the cottages everyone just ran to the end and waited round the sides.
---
If you haven‚Äôt done free range (where you fight a legendary Sheepsquatch), keep in mind you can get all the Sheepsquatch weapons from this event. Those weapons need the materials you mentioned
---
That's because almosy everyone was just making a new character and run to flatwood. 10 minute.  I still do this when i need to lvl up with responder ,naked and in group.
---
Well not everyone appears to be taking that attitude so, obviously not a problem. Every time I've done the event we've completed it with time to spare, and there is always a crap ton of people around for it. So, I'm not worried about it. If sitting still in one spot is what keeps me from crashing and keeps me in the event, then I'm gonna keep doing that. It's not my fault that Bethesda put a chaotic event in an already bugged out, laggy area
---
Thanks for all that info in your posts. This actually makes a lot of sense, and for the most part I was looking for perks that would protect the character after level 50, so by the sounds of it Iron Clad might not be worth the points, when there are so many other cards I could take.
---
I've had a TSE and an AAE handmade. In my opinion, the TSE is a lot better. Hate furious, so I'll never speak on that. So between TSE and AAE on the handmade, I'm going with TSE
---
Is that leaked or did somebody make it?
---
It's not classified ,you have pictures. If you want it go grind it.  9 days,you need 1555 a day,which is 3-4 matches till the last people alive.
---
saw someone earlier with it
---
No two shot is terrible and has been for a good while
---
&gt;  I know if I do ONE I get 10 Atoms
---
No, you don't. Did you notice the (0/3) in there? You only get the measly 10 Atoms once you get that up to (3/3), be that by getting all checked off in one go, or by leveling up three times (even on separate characters).
---
Trust me, I do this challenge every day.
---
I thought you needed a skull to make the staff or club heavy mod. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever crafted one, just looked at the ingredients. I‚Äôm probably wrong.
---
Funny story about that, I got bored of Outerworlds by the time I reached the parked ship. Frankly found it to be an overhyped title and the character creation process was pointless in general with a total lack of third person options to see the character you created outside of the menus
---
mh.. i have concluded that elite players are a different breed
---
Two Shot was nerfed back in March, it's just a flat 25% damage upgrade
---
Yeah I‚Äôve farmed free range for months and made a business out of selling all the variations of the weapons available. The skulls aren‚Äôt ever used. I don‚Äôt know why seeing as there‚Äôs literally a skull on the staffs and clubs, but they just use the horns
---
All of the parts are available at Braxton medics supply, south of thunder mountain.
---
Same with a tse weapon. My build is tse shotguns. They used to do 400 ish damage wi Yhout perks and yet mine doesnt go over 230 anymore
---
Fireman Helmet is purely cosmetic.

---
Really? I played around a bit with a regular minigun and theyre pretty bad while with my TS minigun i can mow down a legendary scorchbeast in seconds.
---
What‚Äôre the other rolls?
---
Hey, your (4) is my hiding place to farm the event while I'm AFK, at work, or asleep. ;-) 
---
About the second stage: do the three candy bowls respawn immediately? There is a cooldown timer before you can use them again, right? I'd also like to add, do all the graffiti in that stage, they fill up the progress bar quite nicely.
---
Just bash damage, it‚Äôs a 2*
---
I haven‚Äôt had this problem though last night the robot was killed in about 3 seconds and I guess my shots didn‚Äôt connect. First time this happened. Oh well, 5 scrip gone.
---
Idk then, def not broken, pretty sure it only gives a 30-40% damage buff, compared to Bloodied junkies and Anti armor it‚Äôs the lesser primary damage wise
---
i paid 15 euros for a month, it aint much 
---
just skip buying snacks for several days and you got it for a month
---
Yeah that doesn‚Äôt bother me as I‚Äôm there for the rewards, not bothered about a 1 star. Now if it was a 3 star I would be.
---
The 2nd part I've only done once. It's not something one can strategically do for long periods of time. After so much time when a server has started, the game will stop placing new people on it except when they join a friend who's already on it. It gets to a point where less and less people are on that server as they leave over time. (Technically you can get your whole own private server by everyone else leaving but before the server is eventually shut down for maintenance.) So eventually there is no one, not enough, or no one interested in completing it. 
---
We're on the same page with that though, if someone is around they should help.
---
The event is a lot easier if you dont aggro the robots though. For the court yard fork the lawn &amp; grab candy as you go back and forth. Cottages just grab candy in a cycle and graffiti.
---
I am not angry at everyone just fed up with wanna be hate baiters. see just because I call someone a fucking hypocrit doesnt mean I am mad either. that just means they're a fucking hypocrite. that some true enough colors for you? so whats the answer are you. as an anti bether mad because you can't sell your pvp instant win duped crap? you mad because you bought it and no one is at a workshop? or are you mad because you're to broke to afford it? because its their product they can price it however they want. you don't have to buy and they dont OWE you a damn thing. can you grasp that concept?that enough true color for you?
---
Not the only one, constantly dying at the moment, mirelurk Kings are insane and unyielding seems to be broken.
---
Makes the game much harder.
---
Adds another twist to the game
---
I‚Äôm complaining but I could just do it on my own server as I can solo it. I don‚Äôt because I like that it‚Äôs a community event and everyone joins in and it‚Äôs complete mayhem. It‚Äôs boring doing it on your own.
---
Lol why did someone downvote this, is it against subreddit rules?
---
You need to do 3. It‚Äôs only worth 10 atoms. They can be done at the same time.
---
they have a 5s timer each, so sprinting between those 3 usually results in one of them being up again by the time you are done with the third :) 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 and so on!
---
Um.... no you won‚Äôt lol. This challenge is for 10 atoms.
---
Then the mods are biased. and their subreddit is losing members left and right because of it. membership at filthy casuals has been growing steadily. 
---
I dont care how you talk to me  like none. this conversation is for the sole purpose of viewers who lurk but do not post.  I will be a counter to all the negative bullshit aimed at beth and call it out. 
---
I lurked here off an on for over a year and  the haters are just taking over man. naw fuck them.
---
Seems pretty dumb, might as well replace it with the +25% dmg legendary effect from fallout 4
---
Interesting that you hate furious- can you explain why?
---
You can tell yourself what you want to make feel better, but calling someone hypocrite when you in turn are one yourself, that was the point off my post. Let me spell it out for you.
---
No I'm not mad at all, yes I can afford it, but no I'm not buying it. For the simple fact that I don't agree them charging more money when the game is the mess it is. 
---
I have said it before if the game had 90% less glitches and they would stop been lazy reusing assets. I might think about it. I do love the game and the franchise. I just don't agree with the direction the game is going. 
---
And yes you showed your true colours by not been able to handle someone having and different view as yours and been a hypocrite yourself. Does are your true colours. 
---
Have a good day I'm done waiting my time with you.
---
Stop trying make fetch happen. Ok boomer is lame.
---
I‚Äôve heard you can get the plan for this from the claim ticket near top of the world, at the location in the end of the raider questline
---
I saw another post mentioning the OP TS Minigun a few days ago, it might be just that gun. Two Shot is basically shitty on most other guns since the nerf as it also impacts accuracy.
---
And it's absolutely useless on a shotgun, since it just gives you one more pellet at 25% damage, so that the extra TS damage would only be 2.5% if one cartridge had ten pellets (actually don't know nor care how many pellets are in there...). :-(
---
Is there an armor buff? I‚Äôm not sure what you mean. It adds DR if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking.
---
It wouldn't have ever been nerfed if the trade market hadn't become flooded with duped weapons. People were only trading the same Twoshot explosive weapons amongst themselves. At that point they have to fix broken effects.
---
Just personally not a fan of it. I've had furious weapons before, the furious effect doesn't seem to actually work? I don't know if it does now, but back in the day it didn't work right, so I really don't like it
---
Yeah the hackers that i hated at the start of the game are now lvl 300+, and still hack.
---
I love this gamemode, but boy do those lame hackers frustrate the crap outta me.
---
Lol. PC?
---
I‚Äôm in console and really like mode, won a match yesterday because one of my team mates got all nuke codes/briefcase. He messaged me to walk a little closer to him so he could launch. Killed everyone remaining except one guy somehow still in the sliver of space where we were. Once he finally showed his face we destroyed him
---
That's what I meant, I worded it wrong lol thanks üëç
---
If you see the answers to the others I have acknowledged that I am indeed blind or just dumb :)
---
If they do pve only servers then workshops should be taken out
---
Haha yea I nearly bought a TS Double Barrel a few days back because I thought TS would make it shoot two bursts of shot. Glad I asked reddit before doing so, it wasn‚Äôt cheap.
---
I just need to learn too read :)
---
no just put a cap on how many you have so one person cant control all of them.
---
1 or 2 would be fine.
---
Fortnite types
---
It works but barely noticeable.
---
The armored backpack adds 90dr and the insulated adds 90 er
---
I wish I played on console sometimes
---
That is bloody good
---
good stay fucked off while your gone o/
---
Had it happened, but just sat around for a bit chatting with friends. It let me respawn after half a minute (treated it like the timer death during a public event). Came back, hadn't dropped junk so I still had it all. Still got my rewards so I was content.
---
Junkies is much stronger than tse and that's only one effect if a gun as opposed to two
---
Or the mothman alter down by the water....
---
I put on cammo face paint for some added cover in the bushes
---
pretty sure thats agains subreddit rules.
---
I have a few two shot weapons. A shotgun, .44 pistol, and TSE Combat Rifle. Shotgun says "174 DMG" when use it I get scattered numbers (being shotgun I'm not surprised) but I find that unless I'm like right in the enemies face it doesn't do that good, in which case I'm prolly better off using my deathclaw gauntlet. Combat rifle seems more accurate but also needs a lot more shots to take down enemies (DMG is like 92)
---
It basically boils down to playstyle and preference:
---
If you are using vat critical build WITH Concentrated Fire, 2-shot is great because by the second or third shot, the accuracy penalty should already make no difference. In this scenario, 2shot is great for clearing out AoE situation where most mobs die quickly and you can switch targets as many times as you like. 
---
Furious is better than 2 shots if an enemy has high health since the damage bonus is capped at 50% at 10th shot. So fighting high HP enemies like sheepsquatch, SBs, etc. furious will be better overall - that is also assuming that you won't switch targets around too much. 
---
That being said, Furious is probably better with some situational inferiority.
---
Nah they are cheap and just dont wanna bother with the effort.
---
Happens in Meat week all the time.
---
Sucks about the hacking, man - I'm on console and have never had trouble with hackers. I don't think they should trash the game mode though, I really enjoy the grind for new cosmetics. Working my way to earning that pink frosted sprinkled power armour
---
So you‚Äôre happy to pay 13 dollars for an outfit but are still morally outraged by the entire FO1st idea? 
---
Makes sense.
---
The subreddit is losing members because of the ridiculously predatory route Bethesda took instead of creating a working game for all customers.
---
Not all lurkers agree with you by a massive shot, and the second someone does you respond with "naw man fuck them i'm 100% a grown adult".
---
It's safe to say Fallout 1st would be much better if it was free, but for soe reason you want to keep paying them to play the game they promised.
---
It's your money, just stop crying when people laugh at your opinions when you're sat blurting stupid shit on reddit.
---
Go on hurry up with the justifications i have countered 15 million times already on my old reddit account,
---
If a low level takes a workshop and get shit on by a higher level whose fault is it? Is it the high level who is doing what the game wants them too or is it the low level who didn't read the warning before taking a workshop? The game literally tells you that your gonna be open to pvp whether you like it or not.
---
How many hours do you have logged?
---
"free" was the beginning of the decline of the gamer community.
---
Lowbies shouldn't be taking workshops then. Like it or not PvP is in the game, and there aren't any level restrictions. 76 was never billed as a PvE only game and PvP has been a part of it since day 1. You dont even need to take workshops to play the game.
---
Adventure mode isnt what YOU want it to be,  no matter how hard you argue.
---
That would be the new MegaNuke‚Ñ¢  that was introduced to all fallout 1st subscribers, now for only an extra $5.99 a month you can now radiate your fellow wastelanders and non firsters with the strength of a 1000 suns with the brand new MegaNuke‚Ñ¢
---
*Reoccurring payments may be required*
---
Thats what i am doing i dont like doing it but once i hit lvl 100 and there are no special stuff such as the halloween stuff.
---
I assume you are playing on PC to have rendering problems? Maybe try adjusting your settings. Is your graphics card within spec?
---
I played NV when it was new and LOVED it, it was the first time I‚Äôd encountered ‚Äúblue screening‚Äù. It was still great haha
---
The game will run fine for you, personally I have a i5 3570k @4GHz, GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB RAM and it runs fine most of the time. However there's the occasional FPS drops in busy areas because of my CPU limitation. It's showing its age in 2019. But it's always been playable for me.
---
Still best to just hide. I had a 4 kill game winner. I think i got a little less than 1k xp.
---
It‚Äôs literally like the Battlecoat and Slasher outfit packs in my opinion, but hey at least I haven‚Äôt spent $20 of Atoms on that ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù Christmas outfit pack last year
---
That is literally what the VAT is in AU, roughly 13 to 15%. So literally would be the same price as a subscription when just looking at the price of it without trying to do a bunch of math to check the taxes on it.
---

---
Um, meat week was not in WS. It was not in a densely populated area. People did not do certain parts of meat week simply because one shotters. That, and the items you got were pretty mehhh. Wasn't the best event.
---
This explains alot
---
But it will top the ps4 version for sure ?
---
It's all about DPS - Damage per second, and yes that second round even nerfed does make a big difference in DPS.  Take a standard barrel mini-gun with 2 shot, 25% faster fire rate and you'll be slinging out around 22.75 hits per second for a total damage per second of 682.50 (30 damage each round x 22.75).  With out two shot you're still slinging out 22.75 hits per second, but your DPS drops to 546.0 per second.  That's a damage per second difference of 136.5 and this is in part why you see such a difference. Nerfed or not, that second round can still make a difference in your damage per second numbers!
---
Definitely.
---
Which I find funny.  You go to any F2P mobile game and the ‚Äúwhales‚Äù are spending hundreds a month, and for that money you aren‚Äôt even getting anything useful
---
$13 here would get you laughed at by everyone but the actual F2P players
---
Maybe they should add a true whale level, call it the ‚Äúwhite springs‚Äù level. Then the non-subs and first subs can join up to hate them
---
Picture of the shotgun??
---
Have you heard of E.T. for the Atari?
---
FE and AAE are a bit better, more accurate and durable. TSEs are quite cheap on the other hand, more than any other "god" rolls (as perceived by general public).
---
I‚Äôm over 2000 and my friend is at 3300, we both still play. My group chat probably has about 1500 on average across 12 people. I‚Äôve had a ton of fun :)
---
Mhm. What about irradiated wildlife spawning around cottages? When they spot you, they can get you in seconds.
---
On a second thought, it's a good mode. Makes no sense to shut it down or come up with a huge anti cheat to just to deal with hacks on PC. But can you please ban them cheaters when people report them?
---
If you were on PC it was definitely a hacker. Behtesda put no cheat detection or anticheat software in this game, so hackers can literally hack NW just by using "cheatengine". Not to mention bethesda rarely bans them, just go look at the AMA done by "beef_curtians" did in this subreddit a few months ago.
---
He is one of the best known hackers in NW and would literally stream himself hacking and people would report him left and right. Took nearly 2 months of reporting to get him banned, which is when "beef_curtians2" account showed up. 
---
Pretty sure that one is still actively hacking NW with fly mode, unlimited ammo, able to fly underground, 1 shot kills, autoaim, etc.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4APymXwROM
---
It's a small amount more demanding than Fallout 4. If you can play that ok, it'll be much the same with 76.
---
The issues are less your machine and more the iffy game code. People with beast machines can still have issues under some circumstances.
---
I can taste your salt from here. 
---
I'm going to buy a 3 more months of the 1st membership in your honor.
---
You are providing good info here, but I'm not sure I can give you an upvote because I don't love that private servers are providing an opportunity to get 2-4x as many opportunities for rare loot from a limited time seasonal event. Meat week you could sneak in 2 by jumping from a fast server to a slow finishing server, but delaying the start times with empty servers feel like pushing it too far.
---
It's the exact opposite for Rust.
---
Careful, mate; mods in here are *extremely* prone to banning for naming and shaming; definitely more so than devs are prone to banning the actual aimbotters.
---
There's new rewards in NW?  Is it the same as VTU based on XP?
---
That was my go-to. Always seem to be enemy fights there too. Sheepsquatch vs mutants. Mirekurks vs scorched.
---
You'll only ever get banned for having been in the dev room. I've owned some stuff from the Dev room myself. They either delete it from your inventory or it isn't important and you can keep it.
---
There ya go.
---
I end up PvPing eventually every single time I take the ammo workshop. I dont see it stopping, and I'm ok with that.
---
It isn't naming and shaming when the dude literally came into this sub himself and did an AMA. It isn't witch hunting or anything if they are a "public figure".
---
They don't. Just the players that have been in the dev room, they get flagged. And if you do happen to own something they don't want you to own, they'll delete it from your inventory.
---
I agree that's unbeatable then (and insane, lol).
---
Damn. That‚Äôs fucking impressive. I‚Äôd give you an award if I had money to.
---
The worst part is, it USED to be an MMO engine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebryo
---
in full agreement there. i caved in for the outfits sake (fashion apparently takes priority over fashion in my case) but the benefits you gain from a private session is insane, just to name a few:
---
1. full wave of mobs in events, not 1 per wave with 3 minutes standing around doing nothing, a full 7-10ish per wave is standard, this also results in way more legendary monsters per wave which results in more and better loot overall. Awol for example had one legendary per wave, guided meditation had 1 per wave with the odd one even having two due to the sheer amount of mobs that spawns, This rarely happens on public servers due to the monster budget always being capped out.
---
2. Server lag is nonexistant - everything you click happens instantly.
---
3. Resources are up, no serverhopping needed, its all there for your taking.
---
it's what the base game should be and only highlights that public servers should be capped at 16/18 players at most.
---
Does the flamer work? If so, all your enemies could die with their last sight being a huge nukacola suit roasting them.
---
&gt; we didn‚Äôt have time to do challenges 
---
Bro they want you to buy atoms, not do challenges
---
Lore reference x) The overseer of vault 51 was the only remaining people of vault 51 and he was able to escape ZAX experiment contact vault 76 dwellers. But even he, wasn't able to gain enough XP for the event xP
---
I foolishly tried getting all the bones from killing super mutants. I accomplished it but it took way too long.
---
Some items also had their weight changed i.e. the paintball gun now weights 250 pounds, so, in other words, we can have them, but they are officially pain in the ass to store

Hard to know if it's the servers crapping out or if it's client side due to packet loss. The server itself might be doing just fine, but if the network in-between your PC/console and the server is lossy then you can crash out, though other folks on the same server might still be just fine. 
---
Basically if your client isn't getting enough valid packets from the server you'll encounter freezing (because your client doesn't know what to do so it pauses until things catch up) and/or crashing (when your client finally says fuck it, don't have enough information from the server to continue).
---
TS weapons are kinda bad to other effects and I think you are over exaggerating

I believe there is also a leaded version that adds +90 rad protection as well

If you read terminals in the Outer Worlds, you'd see there is actually a high likelyhood they are in the same timeline. The terminals literally refer to "the Great War" with capitalization, oct 23 is a major date in the game, etc.
---
It basically follows the timeline set out by House in NV where he talks about going to space in 100 years. The "skip drive" in the outer worlds was created roughly 80 years after the date of NV.

I'm in the same case as you. I own a ps4, XBOX One X, and a gaming PC. I play FO76 on ps4 and I'd love to enjoy it on PC, but the main argument that's a no-no for me is hackers. It's safer on console atm.
---
That is truth. Although ghouls can miss any robot on their chasing and follow you all the way to mischief pyre. Charred will not make an easy target, because there aren't sole shamblers spawning.

Damn, well thats not much of a deterrent then....

Theirs actually a acid location close to the holes workshop slightly to the left of it I found it on YouTube its a good place to make came as you can run over to the workshop and have both going at the same time. Also killing frogs drops at lot of acid.

Wastelanders is going to be another update not a DLC.

They stated in the no-clip documentary that all content would be released as free updates rather than paid DLC so as not to split the player base.

Well looks like I'm playing nuclear winter till I'm lvl 73...
---
Are you on PC or console?  Im on PC and the event has never crashed on me.  Matter of fact the game itself rarely crashes on me.
---
Lmfao "paid safe space". 
---
They downvote because you speak truth to stupid. 
---
The reason these subscription idoits are in public is that they dont have any friends who want to play this shid.
---
First time i hear that
---
The hackers in pc is  common problem??
---
Also, by hackers you mean pvp? Beacuse if that so, im not a pvp guy anyway..
---
Nothing in Fallout 76 is free though, and the whole company has declined into chaos. Wonder why..
---
Bye FeLIcIa

Hey I would do it too for rare outfits so no harm on you getting yours. My disapproval is for Bethesda allowing an on the hour event to be delayed that way. I was 19 events deep before I got my first rare outfit so the ability to bypass the frustration would have been highly appealing to me.
---
You don't have to sell me on private servers I can already see how awesome they would be. The game runs the way you should expect a AAA title in 2019 to run and now its true that actually it just works. I wandered into a few private servers accidentally off my friends list before I knew and then on purpose a few times when invited doing trades recently. When one owner logged off and my kick timer started I went and hit all the weight rooms I could for free lead. Lol. If I ever do 1st I will definitely be spending the entire month at hemlock holes workshop harvesting a lifetime supply of acid in between smoothly running events.
---
Fallout was an RPG created by Cain/Boyarsky, then bought by Bethesda; and then messed up.
---
TOW is an RPG created by Cain/Boyarsky, which has not been messed up by Beth.
---
i play a lot of NW and the cheating is definitely a problem
---
we can only hope bethesda adds a proper anti cheat
---
Not quite, but at least they give me a free shafting at the first of every month. It saves in the long run.
---
NW has no anticheat software or ways of detecting cheating. It is over run with hackers due to the fact you can use "cheatengine" to hack it like it is a single player game.
---
If you follow the guide, the only ones you need to kill is the ones by the triple trick or treat bowls, after that you can go off the main cottage road to avoid agroing them, there is one or two near the bonfire you need to light up, but after that it should be free of agro until the boss
---
"that our games have had a few bugs"
---
I just encountered a terrain cheater again and he showed me the exact location of how he gets the drop on doofus players that shack up on the bridge in Morgantown. As much as it's nice to get the upper hand, I don't like cheaters. I've recorded 3 different people using the same exploit. Bethesda does not care to review these things. That's why it's out of hand.
---
Pitter patter, Bethesda.
---
Take my upvote
---
Thank you kind wanderer
---
there is zero consequence.. so why wouldnt people cheat?
---
Yup, if you got a bunch of junk you want to get rid of price of most of it at one cap per piece and it's going to sell.  As of yesterday night I think all the junk I had my vending machines was sold.
---
No it really isn't. GTA V is larger and more densely packed than this game. Hell San Andreas was larger.
---
If you play on PC, feel free to add me ingame (drop me a PM with your username) and you can come and leech whenever you feel like it without paying the subscription fee for free junk, EU one, though!
---
also got spare fireman outfits (due to well, method above) if you dont manage to get one aswell.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Yep, aimbots. Was this on PC or console?
---
everyone complaining about NW gets their thread deleted as soon as the mods see it. not sure whats up with that. are people not allowed to complain about hackers? there needs to be awareness that NW DOESNT HAVE ANY ANTI CHEAT SO LITERALLY EVERYONE CHEATS.
---
example deleted thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dqigrh/psa_fo76_on_pc_has_no_anticheat_at_all_you_can/

I dont have armor plated. I use the one that give more space but decreases red resist, which sucks but idc.

Bloodied unarmed with a meat hook running the right mutations for single hit damage.

I use junkie builds. Any  junkie weapon is viable allowing for a well rounded character build. If i get bored of a gun or run outta ammo no biggie, i got 4-5 diff. junkie guns.

I'm on Xbox and out of 15 or 16 times I've done the event it has crashed twice.  Once it was super laggy and instead of letting it sit I was hoping my Pip-Boy, open the map, stuff that I know probably didn't help and sure enough it hard locked and I had to reboot the counselor. The other time it crushed to main menu. Thankfully I was able to rejoin a different world and complete the event.
---
I've read a couple things that say you can clear your cache on your machine and it helps. On Xbox you shut it down and then unplug the power for 30 seconds and plug it back in. People swear it helps when you're having random crashes. Not sure that on the procedure for PlayStation or PC.
---
Also someone else posted is to fast travel to the White Springs Courtyard a minute or two before the event and let everything load in. Then walk over to the park for the event starts and do it. That definitely helps with the lag of the courtyard loading in later.
---
Thanks for the offer. I'm on Xbox though. Have fun out there.
---
it also reduces carry weight as well as adds armor so... better off leaving it un-upgraded
---
pistols also have one ;)

server hop tanagra town.  about halfway up in the cave there tends to be 5-10 crickets with 5-7 acid each. its my go to spot for acid

A fully modded assault rifle or pistol will hit the same kind of ranges as a rifle so a pocket handmade or if its weight issues a pocket revolver would solve your range issue

they do it like this specifically to shoehorn you into buying the bundle...

This also happens with the laser gatling (not always), but I thought it was because the weapon took another core from my inventory? If it makes up new plasma rounds that you did not have before the gatling might do the same for fusion cores.
---
this just occurred to me at my camp in whitesprings
---
I got them, or at least most of them on the Whitesprings, in front of the Enclave bunker entrance that has a cap stash on top of it. It took a bunch of times because other people already took some of them, but I could just check the place out after every mischief event without wasting much time.

That said it's unreliable, the Whitesprings is so crowded now.

tanagra town is good
---
Tons of ways, the lack of any type of anti cheat software, or even cheat detection software in an online game. The complete lack of QA testing, the releasing patches from old builds of the game that reintroduce old bugs, the terrible quality of the servers, the mass dupes still in the game, ETC.
---
Just the helmet. The outfit is event only.
---
Its a micro-chasm of this game right now, something good being ruined by implementation.
---
Far more efficient than hemlock holes. 10-15 mins doing something like this will yield more than hemlock will in a few hours.

I usually get around 800 to 1k xp by soloing 1st.
---
I think you get points by reviving teammates too. Try to hide with some friends but don't go for kills if you've not considered risk vs rewards. Placement and survival time are the most of your xp in the end. So if you engage, be sure you'll not start a war in your area. If you have to kill, check the surroundings and be patient (I had one time yesterday when I wanted to snipe a team of 3 camping on some stairs, the time a could get a clean shot, they went greedy and engaged two people, two of them rushed them, the other one was trying to mortar them with a 40mm, and I landed a headshot on him, forcing him to retreat, he was the only survivor on his team and I stood unnoticed). If you think you can take your target(s) down, be sure to so it quickly, I like to run  gunslinger+commando+adrenaline because you can melt people with an auto laser pistol, and if another one shows up, you're still buffed by adrenaline, be sure to play safe, cover, heal.
---
Otherwise, hiding can lead you to 3rd or 2nd place alone, when you see yellow barrels, use it to gain a mutation with rads, with luck you can get chameleon. Also in NW, radaway doesn't take off your mutation, it's safe to use one after mutating.
---
They went back on their own word though with DLC being free. Look at the majority of those making note of non cosmetics in atom shop.

Even if she did have a degree in knitting, her hourly wage is still controlled by the market.  She would never make a consistent $107/hr salary selling standard quilts as noted by the OP due to the number of hours it takes to create and the general value that the market places on a knitted item.
---
Maybe sell one quilt per year made of pure gold strand for $250,000 to some rich asshole like Bezos or Trump.
---
Same thing with the Mothman smoke machine, bundle or nothin
---
The goal is that you get desperate enough to pull the trigger on buying Atoms rather than trying to grind for them
---
Sometimes the bundles come back as a limited time run with % off, so maybe around Thanksgiving you'll have another shot

&gt;million dollar per lifetime option for the new power armor green skin.

18 dollars for a black skin didn't quite cut it for Bethesda.
---
You do know the term boomer has been around for like 60 years right?
---
There is no such thing.
---
I totally agree that they say one thing and do another. 
---
But I think even they know that bringing out what has been advertised over and over again as an update on the update roadmap as a paid DLC instead would really damage the game.
---
Usually i'm trying to fight alongside other players around, but i got your message.
---
sorry, but anti cheat is a fallout 1st benefit.

Full auto does more dps, but semi saves ammo. I started out using semi-auto to level up and save ammo at lower levels, then when I got around level 50 switched over to auto to do work against the queen/bosses.
---
Yea! I had yao gui vs fog crawler! Both legendary.
---
Someone‚Äôs on a killing spree. I run a fissure loop myself. Everywhere I fast travel after a kill they drop from the sky. It‚Äôs a pretty popular pastime now that sb‚Äôs can be legendary.

I don't have very high expectations for Wastelanders after its delay. I dont even have high expectations for the next elder scrolls game. Pretty sad.
---
Massive case of Hindsight fallacy
---
Edit: Each pellet has it's own little explosion. So probably only the first pellet works with Instigating? Maybe a shotgun main could tell.
---
I got an explosive shotgun myself on the last Purveyor sale, and when I used it this happened often. I mean, I dealt damage but they healed it instantly, and I had to be pretty close to deal meaningful damage. I guess it's something about explosive guns or about the multiple pellets, because Bloodied, Junkies and other powerful legendaries never failed to register damage for me. Well melee weapons, but that's seems to be a different bug.

Seems like lots of hackers actually have a lot of fun hacking. Here is one of the best known NW hackers that did an AMA about being a well known hacker:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cmgetg/ama_i_am_the_infamous_beef_curtons_i_have_been/
---
False, me and my boyfriend both have it. We're on xbox. So I don't get why you guys think it isn't available.
---
ROFL, yeah, made by the same people who created the fallout series tim cain and leonard boyarsky, but totally just coincidence that they refer to Oct 23 as the "Great War day".
---
50-80% of all games has had "great war" before their current timeline. Are they all related to Fallout universe now? I can play any possible game with future setting and name it "Fallout related" just because there had been a war long time ago before current timeline" ‚Äî judging by your logic?
---
New Vegas is not about post-apocalypse. It is about fart jokes and restoration. It is not about nuclear devastation. It is degeneracy.
---
I can't get this to work either. Best I could do was put a door in between.
---
When the "great war" takes place on Oct 23? and the game is literally made by the creators of the fallout series? Yeah, it is obviously part of the timeline they created.
---
Yeah, don't tell me :))
---
Nor do I, I also think they are being shortsighted and greedy with the fallout 1st move.
---
But if they change the wastelanders update and make it a DLC I think that will be the end.
---
Even the people who pay for 1st can't want half the players locked out of the future versions of the game.
---
Damn.
---
It's like a derpy version, but still super cool. You can draw though.
---
With the way the engine is, they can't add anything that won't be eventually bypassed.
---
Your only choice if you want less hackers is to play on a console. That's what I had to do.
---
Love NW, but the hackers make it impossible to enjoy on PC.

So while I lose some performance and eye candy on a PS4 Pro, at least I my entire team doesn't get sniped from across the map while hiding behind cover.

Mo‚Äô frames, mo‚Äô hackers lmaoooo
---
Probably came here to farm some karma.
---
Yes you can, but the fact that they literally did this before when making the game "the wasteland" before making the first fallout, it wouldn't be the first time they carried the same universe over between different games.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasteland_(video_game)
---
Its an outfit so why would it?
---
Id say stick with PS4 for the bigger player base and no hackers.
---
Yet I have a be gp 50 cal and other weapons that are better than a TS minigun
---
Terran Ghosts is what happened, Nuclear launch detected...... :D
---
Data miners confirmed that it wasnt available to drop.
---
If you can link a video or image, it would be much appreciated
---
Edit: spelling and grammer
---
And that is why I included minimum wage. Even at minimum wage these projects quickly move out of the range of even what those with excess money are going to be discouraged. 
---
If I had to guess the standard printing cost(materials and printer use charges) is going to be $2400. The hours involved in finishing are going to be substantial. You have glueing, sanding and painting. I'm guessing 200-300 hours are involved. At minimum wage that's at least $2400. I would say double or triple it and your likely where someone is going to charge you. So your looking between $7500-10,000. As a comparison you can buy a complete film quality storm trooper suit from Disney at Hollywood studios for $6,615. 
---
Is there a market, yes, but it is very small and full of low ballers. In many cases what people are willing to pay rarely covers the labor costs. People get shocked at the hours you put into these projects and are in many cases only willing to pay the material costs, which can be substantial.
---
Except they literally said it's a different universe and don't want to constantly be compared to Fallout.
---
Also wasteland also is not the same fallout universe, at all.
---
This is literally the story of wasteland:
---
&gt;In 2087 (a hundred years after the game's development), generations after the devastation of a global nuclear war in 1998, a distant remnant force of the United States Army called the Desert Rangers is based in the Southwestern United States. A team of Desert Rangers is assigned to investigate a series of disturbances in nearby areas. Throughout the game, the rangers explore the remaining enclaves of human civilization, including a post-apocalyptic Las Vegas.[10]
---
&gt;As the group's investigation deepens, the rangers discover evidence of a larger menace threatening to exterminate what is left of humankind. A pre-war artificial intelligence computer operating from a surviving military facility, Base Cochise, is constructing armies of killer machines and cybernetically modified humans to attack settlements with the help of Irwin Finster, the deranged former commander of the base. Finster has transformed himself into a cyborg under the AI's control. The AI's ultimate goal is to complete Project Darwin, which Finster was in charge of, and replace the world's "flawed" population with genetically pure specimens. With the help from a pre-war android named Max, the player recovers the necessary technology and weapons in order to confront the computer at its base and stop it by making the base's nuclear reactor melt down. 
---
That is also the story of fallout 1...
---
I think you might be right, some of my friends (accountants) explain to me that it is due to the changes in inflation and deflation, I mean, the economic and financial situation also has to do, what you just told me apparently also applies to many other video games and other things (especially on Steam) but, to put it in a nutshell, now that price for Argentines is expensive, but for us it is cheap. Thanks for your information.
---
I dropped the plan for the empty pumpkin rack yesterday, still possible.
---
Not really.  I have this and never end up using it.
---
I do use the Lead Lined one though, which is basically equivalent to running around with a Rad-X all the time.  But that's also because my choice of armor doesn't provide any natural Rad Resist.
---
Damage Resist has diminishing returns.
---
Can you confirm with a video or image please?
---
If true its a last minute fix on Beths end
---
I got a firemen suit from the Halloween event and I am on Xbox if your interested in making an offer I‚Äôm all ears üòä
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you have a gaming PC. The game is so poorly optimized and laggy that even the best PCs can‚Äôt do much.
---
Are you suddenly getting ridiculus damage bursts while shooting an enemy?
---
Not suprising, there is public source avaible on some forums and you can put it together with a yt tutorial in 30min even if you dont have a clue about anything. 
---
also let that sink in, the source been public for the whole project yet they are unable to do anything about it kek
---
I play on both PS4 and PC and if you don't plan to play nuclear winter, it's full of hackers, the pc version is better, way more nukes than on PS4 and servers more populated from what I see.
---
Wastelanders first quarter 2020. Don't hold your breath though.
---
This happened to me a few days ago while I was trying to complete a photo mode challenge in the mire! I‚Äôm only a lvl 38 and constantly using VATS so that I can look out for higher lvl enemies and avoid them for the time being. Out of nowhere, one of them plopped down in front me and I almost had a heart attack lol!
---
Didn‚Äôt ask what weapons you have. Simply stating that should you ever be blessed with a TS minigun, you will understand that, for a minigun, it is unbelievably powerful and that I‚Äôm not exaggerating.
---
It's a bug from Skyrim, the dragons did it too.
---
I don't know about you, but your ideas of how a game should function are a bit twisted if you think a company like Bethesda actually requires extra money to fix something that shouldn't have been in the game at all.
---
&gt;snarky bitch
---
&gt;are you just a moron
---
Man you know I might have listened to what you have to say if it isn't apparent you use insults to fill the gaps where your lack of knowledge would otherwise be apparent.
---
Its so cool to see the true faces of the vault dwellers, you guys are ripping each other apart while Bethesda gains from it. Fuckin insane.
---
What‚Äôs the trading sub? I just started playing and I have been collection outfits to sell.
---
Yes! It‚Äôs really strange, it already does insane DPS and occasionally when shooting a particularly tanky enemy the damage seems to boost a lot for a moment.
---
Cool -- thanks for the info, will test it out
---
You guys paid 40-60 dollars on launch, and now over 140 dollars a year for these kind of shit servers that would be free to play with almost any other game developer?
---
I don't think you understand what universe means.
---
Ok, I was placed into a lobby with a hacker on my team. They explained that F076 accounts cost $1-2 USD and get banned on a weekly basis. They described their hack as being able to see all enemy NW players in the sky as soon as they get ~1km away on a mini map and can kill them once they enter into this radius by teleporting to them and back in a split second. The hack looks like them just shooting the sky/wall endlessly. They described the game as laughably easy to hack even to the point where you can grief people in adventure mode with no reprisal. There are discord‚Äôs dedicated to buying/selling hacks and accounts
---
I have died to or seen hackers in about 50% of the NW rounds as described. Then again I always Yolo Queue...
---
Happens to me a lot with that i almost killed a queen with on magazine of my light machine gun.
---
LOL, you've offered nothing saying it isn't part of the universe. Tim Cain also never said it wasn't part of the fallout universe, he said to stop using the outer worlds to mock this game. At no time did he say, this game has nothing to do with the universe we created.
---
Playing and "enjoying" FO76 is a sign of being mentally handicapped
---
"hacker"
---
They'll bring an Xmas event, sell 1st, release Wastelanders, sell 1st. But don't expect them to communicate with us besides the barest min to tell us what's new in the shop.
---
I only really play NW now. I find it really really fun and I‚Äôve even made friends on Nw mode.  I often feel like people are cheating but I‚Äôm never sure. I simply can‚Äôt differentiate between people who are cheating and people who are just really good. 
---
How do you tell??
---
It‚Äôs a shame we can‚Äôt discuss specific cases here because it would be good if the players could at least set up some kind of system where we block the cheaters and force them all to just play with eachother.
---
If they are still making money from fallout 1st, they will keep alot of effort and focus towards that. I imagine that they know from all the controversies and wait, it will be hard to get people to buy back into the game once wastelanders is out. Financially, if fallout 1st is driving profits, wastelanders might be delayed slightly again in favour of pushing fallout 1st content.
---
You must be confused with spiritual successor VS same universe. You also don't seem to understand the concept of Easter eggs. Please google it.
---
Yes u are because why would I think a TS bashing DMG minigun would be powerful when I have guns that are more powerful. TS bashing minigun is basically scrip

Toxic Larry is the best way to sort of afk-farm the acid in a tabbed window. Hopping the servers while dedicating 10-15 seconds to kill and farm those ugly SOBs; very relaxing.
---
What? it is more than one person, look at the AMA there is an entire clan of people and a whole youtube channel dedicated to hacking NW.
---
No he didn't...he said no paid DLC
---
Just read the first section:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wasteland_(game)
---
No they listed QoL updates that were still on the docket
---
How about a link where tim cain says this game isn't part of the fallout universe like you claimed above. Oh right, you were full of shit, go figure.
---
2300+ I dont regret any of it.
---
Bloodied unarmed, with full unyielding obviously. Saw a clip of a guy from the queen killers doing 64k damage to the sbq with a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. Thats the upper limit of damage. Probably had 40% power attack damage, but faster swing speed is very valuable as well, maybe more valuable.  +1 strength is the gold standard for god tier melee weapons. 
---
Armor is a little less cut and dry. If your doing bloodied, unyielding is the only option as far as I'm concerned. Dr is a waste after a certain threshold and the stat boosts from unyielding is amazing, 30+ in your stats is great for stealth, vats, crafting, looting, selling, carry weight, melee damage. Sentinels or cavaliers are powerful and valuable, so are the weight reduction effects. 
---
Idk about full health, probably some sentinels something again. AP refresh is very desirable on all builds.
---
Which I hope doesn't happen. I've been waiting on NPCs ever since I completed the main quest line and launched the nuke, killed SBQ. I've been bored for like 4 months, I've put the game down until then.
---
Okay, show me any sign of Vault-Tec, Red China or Enclave in TOW.
---
Oh, right. I just provided a link because it's apparently too taxing on you to do basic searches a literate 5 year old could do.
---
ROFL, an unverified wiki comment. That the best you got? It doesn't even have a freaking citation for it. Not to mention that wiki is well known to be completely wrong. Go look up the BoS timeline on that wiki. LOL
---
I did check, which is why I know he never said that, and only said not to use the outer worlds to mock this game.
---
Keep deflecting when the onus of proof is on you for your claims.
---
Well, I guess that's the cheat I keep seeing in spectator mode that looks like the perpetrator is spamming shots into the air and getting headshot kills, even through terrain....
---
It would be nice if you reported these assholes, but without: 1. Beth adopting/finding a method of banning  cheaters permanently and: 2. Patching the cheat methods.... Nothing is ever going to get better.
---
Try breathing through your nose for once.
---
Do you have turrets stored? Do you have enough junk
---
Vault-tec, you mean the overly dystopian corporation that valued their own profits and surival over human life? Like the literal "board" from TOW?
---
The enclave? They have literal Power armor in TOW. LOL

---
Ahh that‚Äôs pretty interesting, I‚Äôve only come across one legendary so far but since I‚Äôm only lvl 55 I couldn‚Äôt take it so had to run away. Gotta grind a bit more before I can join that loop
---
So posting it here is the worst possible thing you could do! It most certainly will lead others to try to exploit this!!!
---
This can happen to me if I've killed one. The body will follow me everywhere. It's happened off and on for a long time.
---
I'd rather have the scorchbeasts haunting me like this than that air drop box though. That thing is utterly annoying, especially when it lands on your camp, it rattles about something awful and usually blocks the workbench that I happen to need.
---
That was me last night. My grandmother called 5 minutes before the hour so I roof squatted and came back about 30-40 minutes later. The event was over and I got rewards but someone nuked my camp (my camp is NOT in a regular nuked area) I think I upset someone. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. To be honest I have AFK during events before when I‚Äôm super busy and I see a ton of high level people on the map that don‚Äôt really need my help. You can‚Äôt  ignore your Mamaw‚Äôs phone calls though
---
People like you who are trashing the game make me laugh, why are you still on this sub if you really dislike the game that much? You need to calm down son and find a better past time
---
Yeah same got me actually, was doing the mischief event, went back to my camp and one fell on me there. Thought it was pretty cool though so I took a picture
---
Not a fan on my long range rifles, seems to have bad accuracy, esp in vats.
---
On my heavy gunner i like it on my minigun, as im usually closer.
---
So yeah resort to ad hom when proven wrong. LOL
---
Good job little fella, you just completely lost this argument when that is all you can offer.
---
Bethesda doesn't care if you have a few thousand items, they ban people when they have like 100000 of the same item, you'll be fine my dude.
---
It's kind of sad you think you provided any link showing they're the same universe, other than the fact you seem to be confused by the concept of "similarity" or "Easter eggs" in games known to have pop culture references. 
---
I've at least provided a link to a source, which is more than you can say.  And the fact you're dismissive of wiki makes me think you're a boomer cognitively trapped in the early 2000s.
---
Where's your link?
---
its already widespread enough as is.  if you get enough idiots doing it, it does affect server stability and ive seen it crash servers.  forget about doing a silo or raid if someones doing it in your server.
---
Yesterday I came across a level 70 guy on Xbox, had over ten thousand screws in his shop for 1cap each, doubt he will get banned even though they were clearly duped as if he legitimately got 10000 screws he wouldn't be selling them for a cap each.
---
Definitely another PC hacker.
---
Thank you so much! This is actually my first semi-succesful attempt at this art style! The only downside about what you said with digitizing it is that I just cant grasp digital art, but im a beginner, so maybe 1 day.
---
Name one game on console that I can build cool interactive Camps/Bases and have people come interact with them? There isn‚Äôt one. Since 76 came out I haven‚Äôt bought a single other game, how much have you spent on other games? Getting a PC isn‚Äôt a big importance in my life and I prefer to spend my money on other things than games. Ten dollars a month for a game I like is really not a big deal. Obviously I can understand that the junk stash and tent should have been given to everyone, but this is just a game haha. Go read r/news or something haha
---
Aww, no you can‚Äôt do that. But all 10 players were not afk because as soon as it ended they all came out jumping around. The odd player is not a problem but all of them. I‚Äôve done a few today and everyone joins in, it was just this one event.
---
You made the dubious claim in the first place.  I'm also assuming you've never actually played the original considering the storylines would overlap and events are incompatible with each other, despite being similar.
---
I'm thinking you misunderstand tge word "universe"

I also have no problem with wiki's if they are properly sourced and not one that is well known to be completely wrong. Like I said look at that wiki's article on the BoS timeline, they can't even get the timeline right on the brotherhood. LOL
---
T-51 is objectively the coolest power armour
---
Just play fallout 3 and enjoy perfection
---
Yes but further publicising it will definitely not help!!!
---
I assume the wall of text response is you being triggered off a two sentence reddit.
---
Thank you! I used to only draw in a cartoon style, so some of that probably rubbed off on this to give it a touch of derpiness.
---
I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs powerful for a minigun. That‚Äôs the point of the entire post. I‚Äôve used regular miniguns and my TS is considerably better so i wanted to know if all TS weapons are like this. Another comment literally mentions that its regarded an OP weapon. I‚Äôm not saying it compares to your bloodied whatever, I‚Äôm saying that for a minigun, this thing kicks ass.
---
Send it to a yter who only posts fo76 outrage vids without verifying. This would be gold an posted in minutes along with clips from beta.
---
Seriously though, i would send a help ticket to bethesda along with the vid if you are able to. Also follow up, constantly. Cs in all sectors will push aside stuff till you start pressing.
---
Technical in this context is technical about how it works in the game.
---
To the best of my knowledge, in game, damage is ballistic, energy, radiation, and poison (I'm fairly certain the game doesn't distinguish between acid and poison). 
---
Explosive damage is a "modifier" on one of the above damage types, although I'm only aware of ballistic and energy actually having explosive versions in game. Missile launchers, for example, are ballistic-explosive. Scorchbeast "sonic blasts" are energy-explosive. So Dense/Fireproof, targetting "explosive" protection, cover both of those. But a high DR alone helps against missile launchers, and a high ER alone helps against scorchbeasts sonic blasts.
---
The cropdusting that SB do, I'm less clear on. I'm fairly certain the game treats it as energy damage, because it barely does anything if you are in power armor, but it does a decent amount of damage if you are naked- if it was poison, it would make no difference (see mirelurk queens for proof)
---
oh i completely agree, i hope what i put wasn't taken the wrong way, i was trying to add some more reasons to remove this and just submit a report.  hopefully if we send enough the madness will end
---
Youve killed me on xbox! Do you remember shoving your steaming hot bullets up me arse till i spit lead? Dextrouspick539
---
You can download simple .esp mods to make you a god of a NW match. It's a mess right now, don't see it getting fixed anytime soon, aimbots everywhere, people shooting straight up and killing everyone in the match, people literally flying around.
---
Sad to say but if you want a fair game of NW PC is out of the option, console on the other hand has little to no modders.
---
How do you mean DR has diminishing returns?
---
The war is very real prepare yourself for the coming battle
---
We can but hope
---
ROFL, it isn't just "inspired by" when the ending of NV literally is the history of TOW. Down to even the dates, and has the same equipment such as Power Armor, plasma rifles, etc.
---
I'm still waiting on your link to back up your claim that tim cain said it had nothing to do with fallout. But of course you won't link that, because it doesn't exist and you are just full of shit. Like you have been in this entire conversation. LOL
---
Eh?
---
I'm not paying shit right now? What? I'm not even really the one with a problem.
---
You sounds like you're just here to troll...
---
üé∂I don't wanna go, but I think I gottaüé∂
---
It's the most annoying thing that keeps happening. I really hate that this is a thing...
---
Yeah but if you worked your ass off for a year, going through the hassle of swapping them between your accounts, surly you would want more than 1cap each right? Whats taken an entire year to stockpile, someone with 8 and a half days of clearing vendors could buy all of them. Just seemed very off.
---
You can't even sell a quilt for materials + minimum wage in the vast majority of cases. Usually unless your famous in quilting circles. They involve about a hundred hours of labor and fabric isn't cheap. You can buy a quilt mass manufactured for under $100 and handmade ones in the US are sold usually just at materials cost price ~$200-300. Most everyone makes quilts as gifts. My wife does this for everyone who has a child and every year she pumps out simple quilted blankets for NICUs. 
---
I ty flies and it's a similar story. The materials usually cost more than what you can sell them for and professional tyers in the US are rare. They usually make a living by creating new patterns, books and selling custom flies directly to customers. Some patterns can be profitable if you can pump one every 3-4 minutes. Most tyers average 10 minutes or more per fly. Your profit margins are razor thin so you have to make your profit on tying speed. Even if you assume 100% profit from the sale and no material cost you would need to ty at least 5 flies per hour to make minimum wage. I've read that shops will buy flies from people but pay $9 a dozen. Again assuming minimum wage and no material costs that 16 per hour.
---
What are your thoughts on vaccines, Chem trails, earth's shape, ancient aliens?
---
This has been around for a long time. This is why they got rid of bottlecap mines
---
Shoot him
---
That they have about as much proof as your claim tim cain said this game had nothing to do with fallout.
---
Go kill super mutants loot them and their meat bags. Also go to the wendigo cave.
---
Can't wait for the Chinese stuff myself really excited about it and have been waiting for something like the upcoming stuff ever since I saw Mama Dolce's on the old pic of the map pre-release. Also created my first char as a Liberator so I'm def hyped, only problems are the wait and how to build my new camp. Man I really hope that power armor has special voice lines like the Liberty Prime armor, will prob cry otherwise lol.
---
On stuff coming out from previous games you will probably be excited to hear if you hadn't heard the classic Gauss Rifle is coming back along with the Gauss Pistol and Plasma Caster as well as the MEC Gauss Minigun(Really excited about that). I really hope the classic Power Fist makes it in as well. I also really hope the Raider Ordinance/Bombshell Armor comes back as well as the Hei Gui Stealth Suit.
---
I'm a big fan of my JE handmade, but you have to have the addictions to go with it though.
---
My friend was talking about a random encounter.
---
Bushwookies suuuuck
---
Fallout 76 is in the same price range as when Burger King was giving out Sneak King
---
Let that sink in. What the fuck Bethesda.
---
Thank You!!
---
And . saying it's not powerful for a minigun
---
Just win? You get around 1k per match if you win with just a few kills...
---
It‚Äôs afk people like you that I loathe
---
How do you stay logged in when AFK? I get booted after either 20 or 30 mins.
---
Yeah...since fucking launch.
---
So bloodied junkies anti armor furious would be consider better than TS
---
Then you send send me a bunch of clickbait articles providing zero proof and only baseless opinions on tongue in cheek coincidence.  You need to practice improving your sense of humor.

---
Oh yea totally.. i dunno 5c maybe? I don‚Äôt ever sell them so not sure what market value is...
---
Oh ho ho, so deep. I'm here because I like watching video game subs. Haven't spent a dime on Fo76.
---
&gt; I'm here because I like watching video game subs. Haven't spent a dime on Fo76.
---
Honestly depends what wastelanders is. I could create a new character.
---
Still overpriced for what we get imo
---
Shitty static world =/= world with interactables/collectables.
---
But i'm well aware that is outside of your scope of comprehension.
---
It‚Äôs been like this since 1 week after launch tho..
---
Lmao bethestards don‚Äôt like the fact that nobody wants 76 so they are literally giving them away, did I hurt yow wittle fee fees?
---
people will really be out here selling perfectly preserved pies for 10k, oversized mr fuzzy, who does nothing, for 6k. i seen stimpaks for 300 a piece the other day. not to mention the guns that cost 90k rounds of 5.56, like who do you think i am dude? i haven‚Äôt even shot that many rounds since i been playing this game. i could go on and on all day long, i even seen a guy selling ‚Äúyou have been insulted‚Äù papers for 450 like, what????
---
If I‚Äôm not spending any money, I‚Äôm not a cash cow lol I‚Äôm playing the game I paid for, and I‚Äôm having fun too! Yeah the canvas bags were a huge lie, but they got them in the end, right? Clearly, things can get better. Wastelanders is gonna be a huge release that, I pray, releases in an okay state, and if it doesn‚Äôt, that will get better too. 
---
I‚Äôm at the point where I can listen to videos shitting all over 76, whilst I am still playing 76. I think it‚Äôs funny, entertaining as hell, and a good watch/listen. 
---
Unfortunately, I‚Äôm among those who paid full price on day 1, so you can imagine that Bethesda literally will not see 1 more cent from my pocket for this game, and I mean that sincerely.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have fun in the game like the rest of us, and I hope that 76 can someday meet your standards of gameplay, but until then, thanks for the input, and have a good ass day man
---
Static world? You talking about fo76? Since there is literally zero parts of the game world that are persistent. LOL
---
San Andreas was far more interactible with its changing landscape after blowing up the worksite behind the car lot you can purchase, or all the other properties you can purchase and actually persist between play sessions in it.
---
Also, San Andreas had tons of collectables, did you forget about hidden packages? Stunt Jumps? Rampages? etc.
---
As a non-bloodied/junkie build I like my Furious Explosive
---
Logic should be outweighing that feeling at this point, the only good its doing now is for the pocketbooks of the people running this shit show. And they are very aware of it.
---
U LIEK THING STAHP LIEKING THING I TYPE LOTS HOW U DUMM WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  
---
\-You
---
Dont answer here but maybe everyone say i voted afterwards? More comments more attention
---
Tse has been a middle of the pack effect for a long time now. People sell them for way too much because they see old videos and dont know about the nerf, or they get nostalgic about it. Bloodied, junkies, anti-armor, furious all better now. Faster fire rate is better than explosive in some situations. Explosive does more damage up front but ffr passes it after a certain ampunt of bullets.(haven't personally tested this, but seems to be the consensus)  I prefer ffr.
---
The other thing is stealth, if your using rifles you need stealth to do real damage. A stock handmade with sneak attack perks could out dps your tse by a wide margin I bet. Put a suppressor on your handmade and get covert operative and see if you can maintain stealth with all them splodies going off. Maybe look into optimizing your build for max damage. Tse isn't that good anymore but people with good builds can still make them dps really good.
---
Oh I'm sure it'll be reworked. For next year
---
um how does this have anything to do with first? lol
---
Wtf the TNT bunkers are real also? Lol that‚Äôs amazing. What were they used for? Was it actually for storing TNT?
---
Judging by your post. You dont play the game and probably never did.
---
Uh duhhh, they were actively not trying to make it fallout.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have fun in the game like the rest of us
---
You mean the shadow of the playerbase that could be enjoying the game if it wasn't broken?
---
I was thinking about doing that too, but I‚Äôll probably just add a few scars, new hair, maybe some facial hair just to go with the 1 year skip ahead
---
You pay money, they take money, that‚Äôs it
---
Again I get what you‚Äôre saying but there is still a stark difference between the two examples of creating power armor and quilts.
---
It would be very unwise for an artist to build a set of power armor with the intention of selling without it being commissioned.  If they just built it and put it up for sale without any evidence that their price-point is fair and reasonable then the price must simply be trusted by a potential buyer...and that‚Äôs where the low-balls come in because they are assuming the price point contains massive margins.
---
A project like this power armor would certainly be commissioned up front if the artist was building to sell and had any understanding of their market.  That way, prices are set and understood up front and partial funding comes in immediately.  There is a project charter containing budgets and contingency money, and a ledger to track material costs and labor hours towards the budget.  If the project doesn‚Äôt get commissioned then the artist isn‚Äôt wasting their time and money on a material asset that sits around in their garage for all eternity.
---
No one is commissioning the standard run-of-the-mill quilt.
---
Is this a joke or are you really just dense?
---
Do you even comprehend that this pos isn't a zone but a shitty tutorial area?
---
But yeah, seeing as you consider running between NPCs in a pastel painted EMPTY world "content", there's not much to discuss.
---
I lent that game to a friend in collegeZzz haven‚Äôt seen in since.
---
I'm going to go with the years worth of posts I've seen complaining about bug after bug.
---
Hell yeah it is! Have you seen the market subs! Everybody‚Äôs selling trash legendaries for ridiculous prices/expecting ridiculous trades!
---
Ghoul slaying explosive combat rifle called Raisin killer.
---
that is literally the point, that even just a starting zone has more content than all of fo76.
---
&gt;But yeah, seeing as you consider running between NPCs in a pastel painted EMPTY world "content", there's not much to discuss.
---
Compared to running between holotapes in a pastel painted empty appalachia? LOL
---
That dance party in the NW lobby is epic. Definitely not as much - excuse me - fallout in the game about 1st as there is on the internet.
---
That is one hell of a party trick! Am I supposed to give you a treat now? Can you roll over too?
---
That's not a broken economy, that's silly people playing games, or people who are of low Intelligence not knowing how to price things. I sell almost everything at below market, but I have a Pie slice at 10k. Why? Because of how impossible they were to get in FO4, it amused me. Seriously though, most prices make sense out there, from what I've seen.
---
Excellent idea!
---
You need a new hobby.
---
That isn't what your link said, the link you supplied said they didn't want to step on bethesda's toes with their new fallout game, aka fo76. 
---
Nowhere in your link does it say they weren't trying to make a sequel to fallout NV, just that they didn't want it to feel exactly like the new fallout games, which is no big shock with how poorly this game was received.
---
I like the game. My pay to win robot and pay to win fridge haven‚Äôt really changed the game. Wasn‚Äôt really upset about a vinyl bag. I don‚Äôt even feel guilt about my pay to win scrap box or pay to win tent.
---
Now those pay to win emotes on the other hand...
---
Bethesda has been absent.
---
FTFY
---
If that's the case, then I voted. 
---
Hopefully this does get more attention!
---
I had one lying on my house one day for absolutely no apparent reason. Unless my two turrets were just that amazing but I doubt it.
---
So much unsaid from that comment, much more so than what is actually said. I'm content with my lot in life, kind of obvious you can't say the same if you are so willing to lash out like so.
---
My prices for guns don't exceed 5k and armor 2k regardless of the rolls on it. Stimpacks are 18 caps each, but insult notes are 1000 caps. Why? Because at that price it is an insult to the customer. I also give out propaganda fliers for 0 caps.
---
I log in once or twice a week and play with friends. I still have fun in a party, but leveled two characters now and I'm getting bored a bit. The Mischief Week and NW Halloween rewards have me playing a bit more than I would normally. I have Atom stored up from challenges, but still have nothing to spend it on.
---
For those salty, I am still playing Outer Worlds too, but there's no way is going to give me hundreds of hours of entertainment like 76 has.
---
For OP: if you haven't played the game, you really shouldn't be judging. It's definitely not worth $80, but for the $5-$20 it's currently going for? A great deal, without 1st.
---
Ahhh shit sry man. I am really bad with written sarcasm. :D
---
Small things get blow out of proportion. I streamed for 4 hours yesterday, you could have watched and seem zero bugs during that time. I have 600 hours in the game. It‚Äôs fun to play and runs pretty smooth for an only game. I did crash a lot at launch but it ya improved dramatically. 
---
Maybe try playing the game? It is fun if you like the gameplay of fallout 4. Telling people they are crazy for liking a game you haven‚Äôt played is a bit ignorant honestly. Stick to things you know about.
---
Is this only on pc? I haven‚Äôt noticed it on console.
---
I never planned to spend anymore money after I bought it, period tbh lol I like that there‚Äôs an option, like I like that I can just do a few missions and get atoms to get things like the Scrapbot (I named him Davey), because I just like more stuff, yanno?
---
I had the PS4 copy of Fallout 4, and even when all the DLC was up, mod support sucked, and I just wanted more to do. This is my more to do! I‚Äôm more than positive that by the last time I log into this game in the far future, I‚Äôll have gotten my $60 worth, plus more.
---
I will, Im thinking of drawing a different Cryptid today.
---
Why was your post removed?
---
yeah well that‚Äôs what i sell mine for all day long, i travel all the time, that‚Äôs all i do. some camps will be great, most are just ridiculous. have you ever come along a ‚Äúgun merchant‚Äù. might as well call them thieves. a guy wanted 50k caps for a double barrel shotgun that only had ts on it.
---
Bro tell me about it. Last 2 deals I tried to make were a junkies Tesla and an instigating combat non explosive both 2* fuckheads wanted 15k for them like get the fuck out of here. I better be buying a game breaking weapon for that much.
---
What price would you put on them if you decided to sell them?
---
that could prove or disprove the server lag by duping questions lol
---
I vited
---
Just keep in mind that this survey may not be indicative of anything, one way or another. Older players with disposable income may not spend time on reddit (or other gaming websites) but still may subscribe. May also be the case for younger players.
---
That's why I cosplay as Deadpool and Ant-Man instead of Iron Man.  The Superhero group I volunteer with has an Iron Man and it cost him nine grand.
---
I agree with you.  you should really try the black fisherman's overalls though.
---
all aggressive and the staredown lol good times bro thnx for the laugh
---
Yeah just look at GTA. Oh wait
---
For future reference, you should include more questions in the survey such as age group to help refine your results.
---
Cant see the results and vote tally.
---
Todd, is that you? 
---
"It just works" "16x the detail"
---
I‚Äôd buy an extra copy for PC.

Older players with disposible income dont waste their money on this trash to begin with. They are all in Vegas.

Lol you're so angry about everything.

Voted

Plenty of bots on console for Elder Scrolls Online, don't know what what's keeping the from doing it here.
---
"if you're homeless just buy a house" cit.
---
Yeah I just leave if I see people selling for stupid amounts. There are plenty more selling fairly priced items.

That‚Äôs not even remotely true.

Whatever you say, hoss
---
Takes a special type of person to lurk a subreddit for a game they don't play and have no intention of doing so.
---
But you do you...
---
Used to it, maybe. But I will never accept, be ok with it, or not criticize it.
---
This entire thing screams ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have this game but wanna Juno on the bandwagon against the game‚Äù
---
I saw ‚Äùpropaganda‚Äù note for 15k and ye the pies (that spawn on westtek roof) for 25k/piece. If there was in game chat and more like auction house the prices would have been more a like.
---
Some people think legendaries (any level) are worth several K. lol. One would think when people dont sell anything ever, maybe its a good time to change ones pricelist. lol
---
Be in pve aae or junkies In PvP.
---
Kinda like what fo76 was marketed as?
---
Useless post. 
---
Just go in game and keep an eye on how many people have the icon, the scrapbox, do the dance, etc. Reddit is not indicative of the actual state of the game.
---
God forbid people trying to make this dumpster fire somewhat more fun for themselves because Bethesda surely isn't.
---
Raider. Moving my camp depends if there are better locations to farm low level enemies via base attacks
---
That is with the ammosmith perk
---
it kinda depends on the possibilities with these wastelanders, i wanna know if we are able to kill them and if that affects quest lines 
---
i wanna join the mothman tho
---
I shall drink from it‚Äôs sweet waters then!
---
lol, you're gonna fit right in.
---
Let me put this more simple.. Instigating is not a full build as there are Many times you will not be able to use the instigating effect to full effect, even whilst playing solo.. a Junkies or a bloodied build player NEVER ever needs to change its loadout... a instigating Build is going to HAVE TO use other weapons therefore making him a hybrid and not a specialised instigating build.. because there is no such thing as instigating builds.. just the ANYONES crit builds that work very well with instigating Weapons.. like how there‚Äôs no vamps build.. but tankier people still use them.. 
---
And I‚Äôve said this before BECAUSE YOU DONT USE SHIT.. doesn‚Äôt mean other players don‚Äôt..
---
I don't believe they would for two reasons.
---
1. If the results were positive (as they'd want) people would say they were lying.
---
2. If the results were negative, they would not want to make that public as it would almost certainly hurt their sales.
---
Wouldn't they already have the stats of how many people bought it on record? This makes no sense to measure when they already know. Would this just prove that we would know too and nothing changes?
---
I meant, use BE, AA is meh.
---
Now that they learned they can make more $ off this new first program an shoving more features into it. They arent in any hurry to fix or add anything.
---
I voted

!remindme 24 hours
---
Post this on /r/fo76filthycasuals as well so you can get a good grouping of people
---
I answered
---
also, voted
---
Ok thank you exactly what I was looking for
---
Just online, most players have a first subscription. I would say around 60%
---
I'm sure that while not totally accurate, it should still present a picture that is at least in the ball park. Either way it is a place to start.
---
Russian/Chinese hacker online exchange. Your credit card probably won‚Äôt be safe there. Also the money will probably be going to Ill gotten goods
---
I grabbed that camo underarmor and just hide until I have a shot I know I can't miss. I seem to have good luck missing the majority of cheaters that way. Maybe they can't see me in the bushes? I've never watched their streams.
---
So like why aren't the results public?
---
Will do!
---
Your welcome :) I tried to keep it simple but economics is a difficult subject. 
---
You also in terms of physical copies have to factor the price of production too and transporting it too. So like in the EU there's no customs so if a game is made there it's cheaper to move stuff around. However tariffs and customs between countries will effect the price too. Digital business follow similar reals too.
---
AA has diminishing return, but if you want another perk in place of tank killer, then fine.
---
I'd use Quad for more ammo or Bloodied for damage 
---
Edit: Junkies for full health build.
---
I haven't found that to be the case at all. Well, depending on if you like running low hp. Aa is nothing to scoff at though. I have both guns and prefer aa over b.
---
Bloatfly syringer, hit an enemy in a confined space and syringe that one, kill, repeatedly.....  quit when you get board.  Go to scrape ta dah.. 600-700 acid
---
but fyi if you shoot a animal, you're red beacon pops and everyone can see you
---
Hopefully! I am out of sorts here to much. Lots of heat in this pan
---
What population, I voted and now I can't see anything...
---
ok boomer
---
I've been considering a 1st subscription only for the opportunity to circumvent inconsiderate players who feel the need to one shot everything. At least this time I can farm legendaries in peace.
---
God forbid people trying to make this dumpster fire somewhat more fun for themselves because Bethesda surely isn't. If you don't like cheaters/aimbotters whatever, there is a solution: Fallout First. Just make a private world or join the world of a friend.
---
Bethesda isn't going to get a new influx of players so they're basically betting on driving the existing cattle to Fallout First with a painful prod. Not getting rid of cheaters/aimbotters is in their best interest seeing as everyone already has paid for the game, the only question is whether someone get so annoyed to the point of buying a Fallout First sub to not have to play with cheaters anymore.
---
Amen..
---
500 atoms worth xd
---
Voted.
---
Also anyone who is supports Fallout 1st is killing this game and the eventual addition of P2W elements is their fault, not Bethesda's.
---
I voted for ya.
---
Yeah, been lazy and wearing the small backpack till I finished yesterday, definitely worth it
---
Nope
---
Yes a blind population. You can't see the results of the poll so you are blind of the current voting numbers. 
---
Populatuin because you are the people taking the poll. Did you pass high school or go to community college you should have learned this.
---
And you didn't even mention junkies
---
It‚Äôs devastated my junk business cause people aren‚Äôt getting rid of junk in their stash. But it is what it is. The robots still love my junk.
---
worked fine for me
---
Go to the camp north of grafton damn in the toxic valley.  Complete 3 (athlete swimmer and archer is what I do) then you can make a backpack.
---
what exactly is the point of this
---
This sub doesn‚Äôt even represent all of FO76 players, so not representing all FO1 players should be obvious.
---
It's not about 13dollars, it's about milking ppl when their game is not polished and making false promises.
---
I live in Oklahoma lol
---
I voted :)
---
I voted!
---
Then don't use a private world? Unless I'm wildly misinterpreting your post, it's literally that simple.
---
Voted and really curious what the results are
---
Video games are way more fun than actual gambling. Unless you meant NV, in which case ha ha ha. You must think you're so fucking clever.
---
If that's the example you use, I'm not sure you know what IQ means.
---
But why would it? The general playerbase isn‚Äôt even really represented via this sub. You‚Äôre gathering skewed data from a skewed base.
---
I looted a 2* VE double barrel last night.  
---
Inventory screen showed 131 dmg - Best I got out of it @ WS against ghouls @ point blank range was 25dmg.
---
Fallout 1st goodies and more suggestions form people that can be monetised xD
---
Bethesda is a has-been  
---
It‚Äôs not silly at all.  Instigating Lever 1-shots everything up to a 3* level 68 Supermutant.  One .45 for one kill.  That‚Äôs the point of the build. This is on a build that isn‚Äôt Junkies or Bloodied, this is an INSTIGATING BUILD. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs designed around.  It is arguably the 2nd strongest build in the game.  It absolutely DESTROYS in 99% of the game.  The on,y weakness is the SBQ/long fight.  It is super efficient, and the build I‚Äôd recommend everyone plays first since it‚Äôs easy to play, uses very little ammo, and you earn tons of caps because of it 
---
I have different characters that play Bloodied, and none would ever use an Instigating weapon since if you built your a Bloodied character right, you do more damage on the first shot with a bloodied weapon than an Instigating weapon.  So, any bloodied character who is shooting an Instigating weapon is an idiot (or just doesn‚Äôt own a Bloodied weapon, which defeats the purpose of the build). A BE Lever will hits for about 2.2K on the first shot, and the Instigating Lever hits for ‚Äúonly‚Äù about 2K.
---
This, plus you can do seasonal events like Mischief Night twice per hour which increases your chances of getting rare rewards. You also get to raid your lead farming spots or workshops to your heart's content.
---
Why not Austin? Austin made the fallout people hate
---
Voted. Gave up on the game about 3 months ago.
---
1. Public servers aren't going anywhere and even if 90% of the community went to private you would still be on a populated server because adventure servers are easy to fill at 24 player cap
---
2. You can actually play with other people on private servers, too (8 person cap, not 1 person)
---
3. You can go back and forth between private and public as much as you want
---
I'm not sure why you're concerned about this. It's a non-issue.
---
This was a good idea, but I wish you had asked a second question: 1 month or a full year?
---
I find some irony that when I encounter negativity, you think I should stop reading, but when you encounter negativity, you have to argue back.
---
I attempted to move south of Sons of Dane because of all the cool stuff that spawns nearby. I was in the cemetery above the cave, my camp would be totally wrecked every time I came home by SB, or mutants or whatever
---
Because there has been a lot of negative attention around it on internet communities like this so people who see that are less likely to buy it. Obviously there are people who still do such as yourself which is why i said mostly.
---
If you‚Äôre someone who is more casual and just plays the game the membership seems like a good deal since it gives you more atoms per month than they cost in money + all of the other benefits so many wouldn‚Äôt think to much about it and purchase it.
---
People on here though would see how Pete promised cosmetic only micro transactions but has come out with this, the fact we were told the stash couldn‚Äôt hold unlimited because the servers wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it only to give you unlimited with the membership, and the fact this is ptw. This will make most of us not want to support it because it‚Äôs fucking gross.
---
Well, I am not ashamed to say I will be a subscriber in a few days. Got to get home first.
---
Voted. 
---
And not afraid of the down votes, I payed ¬£13 for the game that Bethesda didn‚Äôt get a penny of.
---
Had almost a years entertainment (weird but I like the game) Expected it to be trash.
---
Have not purchased a single atom.
---
Subbed for a month. In my eyes it‚Äôs the least I could do.
---
Don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm ‚ÄúWinning‚Äù though, Still haven‚Äôt got a decent RNG drop. Still want a Junkies fixer. Still not top of the fictional leaderboard.
---
Will I sub again next month ? Unlikely. 
---
If I found out that all profits are going elsewhere and I‚Äôm not supporting the future of the game definitely not.
---
Can I understand people complaining about the scrapbox? Absolutely !!
---
Omfg you are so far missing my point.. I‚Äôve never once said instigating is bad.. it‚Äôs great and extremely strong.. but it isn‚Äôt a FUCKING BUILD pls get off my post now I‚Äôm done with you stubborn shit, you didn‚Äôt even know how instigating worked till a month ago when someone one here lectured you about itüòÇ

Scuse me, thought it was Maryland.
---
Almost never.  1 in 10 if I'm lucky.
---
Where's that?
---
Thank you! Is there a better weapon to be using other than a lever? Handmade, fixer, etc.?
---
This.
---
We should prob also see the deets! I run junkies heavy/explosive...in my opinion it‚Äôs the best. If scorchbeasts take too many bullets, you prob have too many QOL perks and not enough damage perks...

---
Yes, they did. One or two reappeared, the others did not.
---
Had two turrets taking the same physical spot, one literally inside another.
---
I answered yes because yes. :)
---
Can you give more details about which level you have each special stat at? That will enable people to give a better insight into your build.
---
Fallout 4‚Äôs DLC had trophies,  so I don‚Äôt see why not.
---
If you know if a wider way to ask the question without involving a professional source please share it there.
---
Currently, there‚Äôs no transparency. Bethesda doesn‚Äôt offer an API or a data mine for anyone, so yeah they can provide summaries but people are curious about the raw data :)
---
No you don‚Äôt get it, it is a BUILD. 
---
Why do you think when people have crunched the numbers on the strongest BUILDS in the game, Instigating is listed as 3rd.  Why, because it‚Äôs a BUILD.  If you don‚Äôt understand that, and the rest of the gaming community does recognize it as a BUILD, who is the stubborn one?  
---
Here is my version of the INSTIGATING BUILD. It requires an Instigating Lever, for this BUILD to work. 
---

---
Nope. You can move your camp module thing around and it will change where you spawn in.
---
Huh. I've done this, I just noticed my controller started drifting towards 1 direction and had to get a new one.
---
I voted, but I'm off to get a bucketful of salt to take with the results either way.
---
Once the "welcome mat" was able to do that, until Beth removed/bugged it.
---
I voted.
---
Done!
---
For some confusing reason fast travel mats are only available in workshops.
---
I know there's been a lot of heat over Fallout 1st but to be honest there's been a lot of support because due to trash players with a complete lack of self awareness. If 1st becomes successful instead of blaming Bethesda try focusing on greedy one shot legendary players for wiping resources clean and overpricing goods at their White Springs camp.
---
TSE Handmade I've had for 9 months is my main gun. I've tried all the other guns I've picked up and just didnt like them as much. I have a TSE Combat Rifle as back up and Furious Explosive Mini for my heavy. I'm lvl. 236 and this what feels best to me. It might not be for everybody. With all your perks set right and guns moded right TSE is better than people let on.
---
I just want to say that asking this question on this sub will probably get you skewed answers. I have a handful of friends with Fallout 1st who have stopped frequenting this sub because the backlash has been enormous and they were getting personally attacked.
---
Wild Appalachia was a really great add on, and it's disappointing that everything that came after wasn't as enriching to the core game. I did enjoy Nuclear Winter for about a month when it first came out but Battle Royale modes aren't really my favorite kind of video game. While it was really nice unlocking CAMP items and skins for Adventure Mode, the entire Nuclear Winter add on featured no new Adventure quests. Based on what I've seen, Wastelanders will be an Adventure Mode add on larger than what we've got so far, but the wait is very hard to get through. I'd love more seasonal events, the Halloween one is a lot of fun. Hopefully the popularity of Fallout 1st will encourage Bethesda to get a few more seasonal events out to us before Wastelanders. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years could all have their own seasonal event.
---
You cant make a full working build based on one weapon variant of one legendary.. you leave yourself in so many useless situations.. that build is a basic crit build anyone can use with any crit Weapons.. there is nothing there theat is specialised for instigating making it a build over Junkies or bloodied.. you just slot in instigating weapon where useful.. 
---
So how is it a build? You using a crit build and just taking advantage of the use of instigating at certain times.. 
---
Instiging doesn‚Äôt work as a full build because you can‚Äôt use it it EVERY SCENARIO you can use bloodied or junkie in every scenario to full effect.. it is not the same with instigating.. it has a specific use in game.. making it more utility based than anything
---
Handmade and Fixer are good but if you are going to use them, go commando.
---
Butcher's bounty + Ticks + Steel + Antiseptic = Profit
---
i have no issues mowing down opponents with my TSE handmades.  i do also use an AAE handmade on occasion and i can see the difference between the two
---
Done
---
What is the difference?
---
Don't forget chemist (I think that's it, 2x all chems produced) &amp; super duper
---
Simple events will frequently reward them too, stick to the ones in Forest, Ash Heap or Toxic Valley as they're pretty easy
---
My Special Stats are: 10S 15P 6E 3C 14I 4A 4L (currently trying to level up Luck)
---
I‚Äôd think it would be the opposite. If you are dedicated to a game enough to drop 15 a month on it, chances are you would also partake in online discussions of said game.
---
Maybe not this sub, but I bet if you polled Filthy Casuals you‚Äôd probably get different results.
---
With no details about your build, I'd say you need to go go stealth. 
---
If you want to stay loud and proud switch to an automatic weapon. Gauss (and single shot rifleman builds in general) is useless unless you are in stealth to really reap the benefits. 
---
Also I'd suggest going at least sub 50% bloodied and get adrenal reaction serum for the dmg boost. Don't have to be nerd rage level to reap the benefits and if you are nervous get any automatic vampires weapon.
---
You should add to the title that this is a survey or otherwise all those 1st pimps arent wasting their time to click on this.
---
I know but a good chunk are xD
---
Well ... now with the situation that bethesda is having, I don't think they put the wastelanders on payment, which I then see as a substantial expansio. The trophies in my opinion will be there. Then I think it was already a good move to postpone it, if they left it even better for free, it would make the old players come back
---
the AAE takes longer to down enemies 
---
for the record, im set up as a vanguard commando build and my cards are set up for max damage
---
Pretty dope I liked it
---
Done and done
---
No the whole challenge is 10 atoms. For example, if you are over level 76, wearing sunglasses, at the Whitespring, you can check all three off at once for the 10 atoms in one level up.
---
Blood packs are your friend. They can be found all over. Most train stations have 1 in the sink.
---
Just added The First Blade - B Cultist Dagger to my collection, time to kill some shit.
---
I'd like to see the wanamingos return, ya know the tanky alien looking things
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wanamingo](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wanamingo)
---
Yea should‚Äôve clarified that more but i agree with you completely. Just meant that people buying this aren‚Äôt the type to be reading places talking about how terrible it is, so a poll here of who bought it wouldn‚Äôt be the best way to get info
---
You need more sneak, power armor isn't  sneaky. The armor with best sneak and stats would be unyielding. If you want to play full health go vanguard. I would recommend going unyielding/bloodied sniper since most things should be dead before  reaching u. You also have additional damage multipliers like nerd rage and adrenal reaction to use
---
Also, semi automatic pair well with critical perk cards
---
Answered!
---
Not a bad idea
---
Seems so and more funny
---
To be honest, it's also quite possible people who subscribed are staying away from this sub until the people who try to justify harassing them move on. Either way, these relatively niche subreddits are not going to be very indicative of F76's wider userbase.
---
So, I continue to play since day one.  This ‚Äòidea‚Äô is more of a fun way to engage the game, and one that I have found to be immensely fun!  
---
Take Pharma-Pharma, Scrounger, and Can-do to 3.  Whichever it is your after, equip, and play..  just make an effort to check, ‚Äòsearch‚Äô, and take all of the findings from all relevant type containers.  
---
If I‚Äôm short on non-perishable foods, an hour or two checking all the food containers, lunch boxes, and fridges will usually restock my food vendor and my character for a couple days.  
---
Pharma-Pharma will give you much more than just Stim packs, but for those folks wondering how ‚Äòjunkies‚Äô get enough drugs to support their habits... no crafting required.
---
And the most lack-luster is Scrounger.  But, if you want to rack-up massive piles of assorted ammunition, it‚Äôs not terrible.  I find that most ammunition sells for 1 cap each, some types faster than others.
---
Your physical CAMP. You will spawn north of it I believe. If its not north its east.
---
Show us the truth
---
At the same time, it's also worth pondering: just how many subscribes does Bethesda see "promising"?
---
(I hope most of them are one-time subscribers: that first month's payment is the promise, and... well.)
---
If I'm enjoying the game, and the features of Fallout 1st appeal to me, I am not going to refuse purchasing the service to punish Bethesda or prove a point. I am not Bethesda's mommy trying to teach them a lesson. I'm a Fallout 76 player who really loves the game. I don't care what you think of the game, I love it. I don't care about your quest to overthrow the gaming industry's business models. I also don't care about your insistence on gaming company reps keeping their ridiculous "promises" to work for free, to code and program and work away from their families so angry dipshits online will stave off a boycott campaign. Your crusade is failing.
---
As mentioned, just don't play on private. 
---
Scorched earth is fairly easy to silo if you are built properly. Can actually do imposter solo as well with high ER, super stim spamming, and troubleshooters armor.
---
Arkos I think is probably impossible, that's true. But then just don't play on private servers for those events.
---
I am but my hopes were if i shoveled $$$ they would be more inclined to fix the bugs and release new content like a map expansion. Maybe a whole new state.
---
You've never played a fallout game or even noticed what they are if you say fallout was made for micro transactions. Besides DLC's they've never release MT's and I know that for a fact. Stop standing up for that shit. I don't care if you spend your money on it but the same people that waste hundreds on shit are the same people who complain about it weeks later when it gets worse.
---
Bloated
---
Around 2k a day. Maybe more if I chose to or doing well. I try to get a level a day so I can get all the normal rewards so hopefully I'll get it whilst doing that.
---
Fantastic idea. Done and done. Post this across social media, the more votes the better.
---
this 
---
it's much easier to trade using ammo
---
Yeah that‚Äôs confusing because people on the other comments are telling me the opposite haha, I also have max build for max damage that I am aware of
---
It‚Äôs subscription service introduced to Fallout 76. It‚Äôs not needed to play or enjoy the game, it just gives the subscribers some unique cosmetics including the highly sought after Ranger Armor, a monthly atom allowance, the ability to play on servers with just friends (it‚Äôs called ‚Äúprivate server‚Äù, but it doesn‚Äôt really function like one), a scrap box that can hold unlimited scrap (it only holds raw scrap however), and a survival tent that acts as a third free travel point and has a scrap box.
---
Yea exactly, doing the poll here is useless for gathering actual info.
---
Eh, was more hoping for a mass resale of heavily discounted keys.
---
If you are using any other weapon I would not ask this, but do you know the Gauss needs to be charged up in order to do max damage?
---
As for everything else I believe some people already posted useful information so I won't repeat.
---
I said fuck it and bought a month just to check it out. The scrap box is very handy, and it freed up 600 pounds. Kinda bummed my bulk can‚Äôt go in it but fuck it good enough for me
---
Lol i may put on my jacket and call it "Power Armor". Will it make me a reference to Fallout universe? Your blind faith in reality of your fantasy amuses me (actually not).
---
Vault-Tec didn't survive. Vault-Tec mission did survive. I know the only living representative of VT corporation. A ghoul. Fallout 4. Goodneighbor. Hotel Rex. Hating Vault-Tec for dropping him out. Not following their mission in any possible way. ZAX is West-Tec working unit, how can he possibly be any "survival" or "value" for dead corporation?
---
Besides, Vault-Tec is still dead, its bank accounts doesn't exist. Where is the profit? Where is the use of its values? Where are living and claiming non-existing profit members?
---
I answered it
---
I took the survey
---
Totally RNG. I do the same dailies you do and probably hit the same spawn point and some days I get 50% with the gland. It‚Äôs not broken, it doesn‚Äôt need to be fixed.
---
Done survey 
---
It's a good idea really shows how many actually buy the subscription - I'll cross post this to r/PKOA and I recommend you do same for other Fallout communities
---
As much as I like two shot, its more for a close up or riflemen build
---
Furious is op for commando, I swap between riflemen and commando and honestly furious is the bees knees for commando :D
---
The problem is that wihout my power armor i‚Äôam made of glass, even with my best Armor i would melt against nearly every enemy in the game, i wonder if i don‚Äôt have to start a new character to make a new build from the ground up, i played too much Fallout 4 and i count to much on my PA to save my live, it‚Äôs a mistake i never did on the older games.
---
Just killed 4 more in a different location. 10 kills zero glands.
---
If thy are this hard to get, it shouldn‚Äôt be a daily
---
So you want me to take a workshop, but then server hop to get the parts I need to do a daily?
---
Done did dimmadome voted, my dude.
---
That's my vote casted, look forward to seeing the results :)
---
Is this a pc only problem or also console?
---
You‚Äôre having a bad run. I‚Äôve been doing this daily every day for months, it‚Äôs uncommon to have no glands in that spawning spot.
---
I believe it, armors are definitely not cheap.
---
Judging by the replies, kid you better have a proper economy class before talking about this.
---
But the economy is really kinda broken because the inflation is really high and the currency we have is mostly not accepted for high end trades.
---
Answered
---
How much do you sell them for? My Barbed Burning Staffs (the highest dmg one) rarely sell and I've got them priced at 195c.
---
This is the 4th time that I can remember getting zero there.
---
I'm like you an older gamer and I agree this game doesn't warrant more financial support until they fix so many issues ie bugs. I really like the game but again asking for more money when so many issue /bugs are chronic in nature is a no go for me. I still regularly experience crashes/freezing in menus resulting in restarts etc. Fix the bugs and then I may support you with money
---
I started this before 76 was announced :P
---
I find aaffr to be the best but to each their own. In pvp though its undisputed.
---
Could use some PC copies for mules...
---
Also the players who are digging deeper into being a part of a community/forum/etc of the game are going to be more likely to be influenced to vote no. Not really a way to gauge the likely much larger casual players who just play the game and are not talking about the game on Reddit, Twitter, forums, etc.
---
I feel like this is going to get a huge number of nos but that's only because Reddit might not represent Fallout 76 players as a whole.  The hivemind tends to shit on Bethesda (even though no one says a thing about an ESO subscription) and I think the people who vote will just be thinking, let's all shit on Bethesda!
---
Does anyone know if they can add achievements to an existing game? Has it happened before?
---
I thought they had to be part of the game when it launched rather than something you can just keep adding
---
I dont have any junkies, that's why I didnt mention it.
---
i don't know how other people are set up, but from what I see, i get better results with the tse 
---
im maxed out on all commando, demo expert, tank killer, tenderizer, mr sandman, adrenaline, covert opperative, tormetor
---
I thought I had seen ‚Äúfast travel‚Äù tacked onto the welcome mat before and when I went back through I saw just normal mats, guess that explains things
---
People can change their mind.
---
Yup! And its mold free :P
---
Amazing work!
---
Done.
---
I just said I prefer it over bloodied. As I said I have both I just dont like being hindered.
---
I try to charge the majority of my Shot with my gauss rifle, only firing uncharged or switching weapon to a semi automatic rifle if the target get closer.
---
Did you open a ticket to report it?  That is the only way to actually report it, not by posting here.
---
All the pics of me were at crunch points where I probably had gone a day or so without sleep :P
---
It's been an hour. What's the results. Considering there are also 189 comments I assume people have thrown their vote at it.
---
Instigating lever is best I think for farming efficiency. 
---
If dmg is priority, Bloodied is still king IMO unless you want to go junkies. If you are cool with junkies then switching to junkies gets you close to bloodied. In either case I think levers win and TS is great as long as you don't mind missing all the time. 
---
Semi automatic can't compete with auto in the end game really. Bloodied stealth commando wins. But no matter what perks or spec I have an instigating lever will still 1-2 shot most things if you have adrenal and are below 50%. 
---
If you want to go energy the gauss competes but it's so slow to shoot I just can't be bothered.
---
That last bit is literally how I learned. Also by looking at prices in other people's shops. It's really not difficult to figure out what sells and for how much if you pay a little attention.
---
I guess it kinda (only barely) makes sense bc workshops can be much larger than normal camp size but dang that sucks
---
Search meat containers at Super mutant areas. You are guaranteed to find one.
---
RemindMe! 1 day
---
Yeah I'm a big fan of instigating and furious too.  I used a lever for long to medium range and a combat rifle or handmade for close range and mobs.  If you can find a decent fixer I highly reccomend.  I love mine.
---
Free state here, prob check out all the factions before I decide which one I want to ally myself too. Won‚Äôt change anything about my character...
---
Yeet
---
I'm all for supporting the game. What I'm against is locking huge gameplay advantages behind a 13$ pay wall. Here's the thing, had no one bought the subscription, it's not like Bethesda would have gone bankrupt. They would've removed the stash box/tent, lowered the price a bit, and apologized, and the game would be better for it.
---
But no, you guys just *love* to feel special by going against what the mean ol' youtubers say, so you bought so many subscriptions you actually managed to surprise Bethesda themselves.
---
Now, thanks to the loyal subscribers, Bethesda is gonna keep going down this route. They'll probably add XP boosters to the atom shop like they have in ESO. As always, you'll all complain and whine, but three days later half of you will be walking around the game getting 4x XP while crying that you're being harassed in a game with no PVP.
---
And it'll be the players' fault, not Bethesda's. The same way a country's people is responsible for electing their president; you're voting P2W, you'll get P2W.
---
Well then use stealth and welcome to the world of legendaries.
---
Yes and if you sell more you can actually + the price for like ammo or certain junk. Since people who buy have enough caps anyway and its a time saver for them
---
They cost a pretty penny, but worth it if you want it done right eh?
---
A full set of clothing/armor easylie has much more polygons then a single weapon or junkpiece
---
Agreed!
---
Oh no....Thank You for posting the pic! It's BRILLIANT!
---
Another suggestion might be that if you don't even currently play the game at all, don't vote because those numbers aren't relevant to the current question.
---
I haven't "bulked" anything in ages. Plastic is too valuable for my shotgun! And I have disposable things that I can sell the bots every day.
---
Are there other reasons to bulk things? I feel like Beth could get people to bulk by lowering bulk weight significantly.
---
I‚Äôve experienced this too since fallout 1st released, must be some bug that came with the update
---
I answered!
---
Probably minimum $30k-$40k given it would be a year of work.
---
If the amount of your scrip is that close to max, well you are going to feel the pain sooner or later.
---
Thought of running emergency protocols? 50% damage reduction could sustain you. I am full uny sent, but sometimes I get in my PA and I'm still almost unstoppable in pve
---
Putting aside the fact that you're an obvious shill, I'm not sure how buying Fallout 1st will help with cheaters in NW mode.
---
yeah we're a bunch of silly bastads
---
Then you know how bad it is here
---
Do you have White Knight equipped?
---
I rarely need to repair myself, so I only equip it when durability gets low, but I've been playing the stealth game so the enemies rarely have the opportunity to get a hit in.

---
If you want more damage than the TSE lever action, you will be moving towards the Junkies or Instigating Gauss, with an explosive secondary, and weight reduction/reload speed tertiary.  
---
Trying to outclass the lever action single-shot of course.  
---
If you want rate-of-fire as a consideration, more semi-auto spray and prey, then an Anti-Armor, Explosive handmade would be an excellent direction.  
---
If your just after the best possible scenario for a single shot at full health, Ballistic Bock, Orange Mentats, Magazines, Bobbleheads, and all the other essential chems.  An instigating explosive gauss, with sneak, and possible crits, you can kill most non-scorch beasts in a single shot.  
---
I would likely search for both, so you could swap as the battlefield dictates.
---
Ticks spawn at the moonshiner's shack, just south of vault 76. Then a short walk south to the lumber yard. More ticks spawn in and around the buildings. Plus 2 or 3 aid containers inside. Also the repeatable quest "stings n things," given by a bot at dolly sods wilderness will take you to an area where ticks spawn. 
---
Always use butchers bounty to search the corpse for more tick blood. When crafting stims, use chemist and super duper. Also, if you're using the first aid perk, it's more efficient to craft diluted stims. With chemist, you're making 4 diluted from 1 stim, plus a 30% chance to double each craft with super duper.
---
And that is why you have disposable income! Good on you for spending your money wisely!
---
So you believed the media on that one eh?
---
Voted, thanks more making this.
---
You know what's cooler than that? Getting disconnected from the server when you try to join the event!
---
Only about 10% of players visit forums for their game. Of course, someone that quits within 2 weeks probably doesn't but is still factored in the %, but I'm sure many here subbed when they played and quit long ago when they realized the game was in a downward spiral. So the numbers might be skewed against subbing, but still not representative of the player %.
---
Bloodied isn‚Äôt a build then, it‚Äôs just a basic low health build.  You can swap weapons and gear as necessary.  FYI, the most powerful Junkies build is a basic low health build.  If we go off what you‚Äôre saying then there are only low and high health builds.  How is Junkies a build? You are just using a specific weapon and a modifier from addictions on a high health OR low health build.
---
So your whole post is wrong if you want to take it to that level.  The only two builds in the game are simply high health or low health.
---
Data collections, statistics analysis? &lt;3 You've got my upvote good sir and or madam, I do hope you post your final results. Perhaps with some sexy charts.
---
Now, OP. Do you wish to have people who haven't played in about a month now to still vote? Even if their leaving was prior to and unrelated to 1st? Wouldn't want to skew results because I wasn't intended as a target demographic in the study. Considering I left as a result of continued issues and likely won't be back until Wastelanders (hoping a part of the delay was to ensure serious bug fixes unrelated to the content drop are part of its delay. Hopeful as fuck).
---
So with that context? Vote regardless?
---
True. I just completely forgot to pay attention to it these last 4 days. My normal routine has been messed up because of how much I was grinding this event. Trying to run it twice an hour to get that last damn costume (Pirate costume).
---
You can add at any point. Often a dlc will add new ones.
---
And I‚Äôm an older gamer, a DINK and spend more time on Reddit than I should (and than most of my friends).
---
I am a first subscriber.
---
Don‚Äôt complain about it that‚Äôs my word of advice. Enjoy it while you can
---
Done üëçüèª
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox. So rubber band around both pulling them together. I‚Äôll try that. Thanks!!
---
Answered and now commebted for attention
---
I did it
---
‚ÄúMaby‚Äù you need to go back to school.
---
I would but I have no idea how many are out there or what they are. :)
---
Voted.  
---
Remember though, even if less than 35% didn't bought the subscription, it's still a win for bethesda.
---
Go for it!
---
Exactly. 
---
The people who spend time on forums or services like Reddit, are very different than the larger player base.
---
I'm doing my part and took the survey!
---
Far as I know it's just r/Fallout and r/FalloutLore and r/PKOA though it's not an official Fallout community but either way
---
I'm doing my part!
---
I quit fo76 long ago because bugthesda said we could solo everything yet I couldn‚Äôt beat almost any boos by myself. And i was about lvl 150 or so, and had been a huge fan of bugthesda on all other games, not anymore. Best fallout game wasn‚Äôt even made by bugthesda, but by obsidian.
---
Most of the people who subscribe have probably stopped following this subreddit due to all the toxicity aimed at them. So you're not going to get accurate numbers with a poll.
---
Hey I voted. I‚Äôm a subscriber for this month just to check it out but I won‚Äôt be continuing beyond this first month. I bet you‚Äôd get much better data if you added a question of whether you intend to keep subscribing. They might have made good money this month but that doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt taper off with how little content is currently in the game.
---
Live your life, man/woman/Apache attack helicopter.
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt have the same high quality junk that I have. My aluminium junk is twice refined and my asbestos junk comes from only the very best Asian producers. My rubber junk is imported from Sarawak and my cloth junk is Italian.
---
Nah I have self respect. Not much, but enough
---
Only partly. If the player base wasn't paying for for repair kits and scrap kits and fridges, Bethesda would've stopped pushing the atom shop in that direction a long time ago.
---
&gt;good job people
---
Thanks my guy
---
Make a 1-shot build, go kill ghouls/super mutants-&gt;profit
---
That's where statistics analysis comes in. Purpose isn't to find out how many. It's to set a base line to find an average estimate and get a clearer picture. Analyze the data, compare percentages to whatever the estimated number of active players might be (not the number of people who have it installed, which is the number Bethesda uses when stating how many people play, I'm pretty sure).
---
That said. Do we have an estimate for number of active players? Since that is pretty important if one wants to get even a potentially accurate result.
---
Curious to see the results
---
Does work. 5 caps bounty.
---
Im calling it now. Shit with the subscription model is about to get a whole lot worse. Apparently a lot of players bought the game and now bethesda is going to really hunker down the skin the shit out of the community. Good jobs guys.
---
I'd say that while your input would interesting it would also be inappropriate as you are not currently playing.
---
Isn't it very obvious that instead of actually dealing with cheaters/aimbotters the correct way, they took the easy route and provided "private" servers? Not a shill, just pointing out the very obvious and moneygrubbing solution to this problem.
---
Yea.  If I had your skills I'd make t60 I always liked it's more modern look, but the way you designed the t51 especially in your abdominal are makes it look more sleek.
---
voted, FWIW
---
The writings are on the wall, but I don't believe in rumors. Im unsubscribing before the end of the month anyways and I don't plan on ever getting another month.
---
Can you add to a base game? I fully understand that they can add them with DLC but that counts as a seperate game that needs the base game to play.
---
I‚Äôm really going to enjoy my investment. I think I‚Äôll go back to my character wearing the tophat and monocle
---
No offense, Yong is a hate monger who doesn't follow the games he reports on, only controversy surrounding them. He capitalizes on outrage. And because he doesn't follow said games, he often gives incomplete, misleading, and wrong information then never corrects himself.
---
Also are you aware of ESO+? This whole "outraged gaming community" that astroturfs here should have started campaigning about four years ago. "P2W" or not, ESO set the bar for how Zenimax will be monetizing the game
---
I voted yes but I understand it's a bad deal but I love the game
---
i took survey
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking, saying that though, I‚Äôve been on all day here and I‚Äôm just getting up to 11k, hopefully get it done tomorrow
---
Fine by me
---
Sounds good! No vote from me in that case, but keep up the good work regardless. Admittedly, I feel as though I'm made too easily excited over data related things. It's a mystery why I've yet to subscribe to r/DataIsBeautiful or whatever it's called.
---
I did indeed vote
---
No im not, but ive seen people with the stash boxes. Bunch of clowns
---
Bulking makes everything alphabetical and a lot easier to find in your list.  You have to both something to be able to sell them to the vendor. Those are the only two reasons I know.  Bulking doesn't save space for the vast majority of junk
---
True. I rarely check drama threads on reddit    I have bought most things in the atom shop and am happily a 1st member
---
Well because they will update the atom shop?
---
I like to drop a spoiled meat at their vending machines when I see ridiculous prices.
---
ts explosive with the Tormenter perk would make fora good support weapon - being able to slow move down by disabling limbs can be a lot of fun/lifesaving if I'm being swarmed
---
‚ÄúBut no, you guys just love to feel special by going against what the mean ol' youtubers say, so you bought so many subscriptions you actually managed to surprise Bethesda themselves.‚Äù
---
lol. your so bitter that you‚Äôve succumbed to ridiculous assumptions like that. me and my buddies dont care about feeling special, or about whatever Youtubers your referring to. we like bethesda, we like fallout, and we have been saying since release we would gladly pay for private servers. 13$ a month for a game thats been out for a year we are happy to pay. 
---
as for pay to win, im not sure it applies to fallout. is there a way to win? or is it just about exploring the wasteland and struggling through post apocalyptic times...  no one is forcing anything on you, you can play the game exactly how it was if you choose to. its just an option for those who want it and want to support a game they love.
---
dont get it if you don‚Äôt want it, and if you can‚Äôt afford it you might have more important things to worry about
---
Well, as someone who purchased the yearly subscription, I say..... B R I N G    I T    O N  ! ! ! !
---
Aaaaaand you're a dipshit
---
I go for quantity over quality. You want wood scrap? 1 cap per item. You want aluminum? 1 cap per item. You want ultracite? 1 cap per item.
---
(No refunds)

---
That's just the backdrop for the map. If they were to expand the main one even further they'd also need to expand the backdrop.
---
yeah i get it, but still big no
---
i think it would be ok for mobs spawning **inside** our camp building.
---
Its all wasteland out there man, what stops a ghoul to wander into your camp?
---
except turrets
---
Sounds like the extra money there getting is making the game better as you would expect
---
Fingers crossed, will save you grinding for ages :)
---
Those ones will count towards your budget.
---
!remind me 24 hours
---
I have my 3* primed instigating explosive reduced weight hunting rifle that i use mostly, that with my primed furious fixer.  I also have a primed instigating explosive doublebarrel shotgun i just threw in my vendor.  Maxed out rifle, shotgun, demolition, bloody mess and tank killer help a lot as well.
---
 Buying it early like a good dog.
---
It's exactly how every MMO game has worked since forever. In WOW you have to buy the game, then pay a sub, and it has microtrabsactions, all the pay models. Or at least it use to.
---
Of they want FO76 to continue it has to make money, that ain't gonna be from base game sales it has to be from subs or microtrabsactions. It wasn't that long ago, before the advent of "F2P" that you always had to buy the game and pay a sub for an MMO.
---
Like it or not 76 is an MMO and thus must follow MMO pay models to survive, you can pick up the base game heavily discounted these days anyway and I would not be surprise if later down the line it goes full F2P with optional sub like Destiny has just done as well as many other MMO's, Star Trek Online did that too, 
---
Games have changed, it's no longer a one off purchase with these "live games", normal linear games are a single purchase, once it's out it's out, sure there might be some expansion or updates but for the most part the studio moves on, the game lasts a little while then is forgotten, Games like Desti y and FO76 require constant developer input, it's a game in permanent development and thus requires permanent cash flow. It's not evil, it's basic work flow, you want more content, you need people to work on it, and they have a powerful need to eat sometime this month.
---
I can't say it doesn't decay at all, but it does seem to decay *very* slowly.  One of my characters runs Wood Armor and that needed to be fixed on a fairly regular basis, and this whole week, it hasn't even dropped below 100%.
---
I had thought maybe it was because I was being stealthy and just not getting hit, but it seriously doesn't seem to budge.
---
Done and done.
---
No QOL perks there, we have similar builds actually.... Try picking up a a decent Junkie rifle and then take the plunge into the rock and roll play style... I‚Äôm rocking 5 addictions for that sweet 50% damage bonus... Also, the explosive perk has diminishing returns for weapons with the legendary effect exploding...
---
*"Hey man, when in Rome."*
---
Damn i had a look through you post history and by god you are one miserable fuck
---
I‚Äôm so glad I got that on the first day. Took till today to get my last costume (the pant suit)
---
ts heavy weapons with One Gun Army are definitely OP, but this is a game where a giant monsterous cannibal might slap you in the face with a mini nuke so balance is very subjective
---
Honestly if you have chemist perk and whatever the perk is that makes stims more effective you should be able to keep your supply up pretty naturally and craft diluted stims every once in awhile with that purified water that‚Äôs collecting dust at your camp.
---
Were they put on platforms?  Because if you store the platform they will return. The other option is moving your camp
---
Yeah.  I went to shop at a Savage Divide CAMP somewhere around Spruce Knob yesterday and was greeted by triple Scorchbeasts.  They didn't see me, but I knew this character was in no way prepared to deal with that.  So I just waited until they *finally* circled off.
---
Well if you get another one let me know. I‚Äôve clearly got caps to burn haha
---
They dont call it the wasteland for nuthin...
---
Someone can do the math, but I think somewhere around 300 DR or so, point-for-point, it's not worthwhile to keep increasing it.
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if there‚Äôs no Christmas event, something at Top of the World would be nice, as I can‚Äôt think of any reasons to head there after the main Rose quest line. There‚Äôs supposed to be more Vault raids too, but I wonder if they‚Äôve now scrapped those and will use the vaults as a source of future storylines/a part of Wastelanders
---
I don‚Äôt think so
---
Still too expensive
---
Why would you sell wood when you can literally get hundreds of it in 1 go at a few locations
---
Sounds like these players would have done the same with or without a subscription.
---
Voted but dont care for results. The subscription honestly isnt that bad considering how overpriced atoms already are. Its not a bargain. It should be 5$ a month. You can buy very polished AAA games for less. BGS is greedy as F***. 
---
BGS if you want 1 HUGE tip. Revamp the entire map for end-game players. Call it HELL. Call it anything. Cover the map in fire, snow and radiation. Add packs of high level enemies everywhere. Get rid of tons of containers to lessin server load for more enemies. Increase enemy level to 50-200. Increase Armor lvl cap and get rid of legendary effects for pvp. Increase player count. Make a heat/cold system. Reduce food/water effectiveness of raw food/drink;water but increase duration of prepared food/drink. Make cooking more worth the effort, require more resources. Effects last longer. I Introduce 4/5 star items to combat new high level enemies. Make damage caps per weapon class. Revamp wanted system and more. 
---
The game needs polishing and an end-game envoirment.
---
!reminder 1day
---
People dont expect any type of content, except for cosmetic microtransactions? lol
---
Yeah the problem is that the subject group here is reddit people, I don't know how it will affect, but it will affect. Its kinda like asking the destiny sub people if they still buy the dlc's.
---
It may have been a glitch, it‚Äôs happened me a couple of times where I run over to someone dying and try to stim them but nothing happens then I look like I‚Äôm just standing over them waiting for them to die, it‚Äôs so annoying.
---
But I feel that would skew the data by making it look like there is more interest in it than there really is. The first month imo was worth it for the armor and atoms, but not recurring. The drop off after month 1 will be important data as well. I'm sure Bethesda already has an idea for that number cus they can see canceled subscriptions like mine.
---
My Pre-Order price with tax was equivalent.
---
You have NO idea what I paid.  Your just spewing venom at a poster with a total lack of any real information that your closed/narrow mind would refuse to accept regardless.
---
Bottom line?  Game was being given for FREE with a refurbished controller 20 days after launch.  People had paid OVER $100 US for the game pre-launch.  The difference between FREE and over $100 US is far MORE than 1/2 price drop.
---
I guess I got lucky and got a fireman‚Äôs suit last night.   
---
Is there a list of what‚Äôs rare somewhere?   I am having trouble finding any info on the event regarding drops
---
I'd expect more nv throwbacks. Maybe this time we'll get a Barry vault
---
You are in luck, I actually printed T-60 armor a few years ago : https://imgur.com/gallery/1Ivf0
---
Pathetic.
---
Not a subscriber, voted
---
I‚Äôm an older gamer and fall out 76 makes me so mad/sad annoyed.
---
Well sadly that's the thing that's going to keep people's sub as long as they are playing.
---
And well we might get a Christmas event, let's pray it's going to be bug free or we are getting a sad holiday.
---
Hm, it‚Äôs almost like this game is terrible and people should stop playing it because Bethesda is a joke ü§î
---
Except it's not a dead game, consistently comes up in the top 3 mmo lists. Maybe MMOs as a whole are dying sure, but ESO+ IS p2w on account of the free kits, xp, and gold it gives on top. F1st isn't anywhere on that level
---
Some people play non-violent builds, some players object to killing Whitesprings robots (they're friendly until you become aggressive and hit them first), some players are averse to chaotic combat situations. You don't get to choose who you play with, but you can choose how to react in the situations you find yourself within. 
---
People who don't help in an event are still your community members, and you're saying that only violence and aggression against non-hostile targets should earn the right to get a pumpkin plan, a radaway, a piece of candy, a stolen vase, and a witch's hat or a stolen jumpsuit?
---
Same here this is either the most durable scout armor set I ever had or it is a bug. Frankly I can live with this bug!!
---
This.   If I have enough stimpacks which is almost always yes, I go to revive people.   I have noticed in the white springs event that it only lets me revive people like 30-40 pct of the time
---
Game developers track all kinds of things, not just what we see in achievements. So yes, they will absolutely have this info. 
---
No idea why you got downvoted for this. The poll results will have to be taken with a huge grain of salt.
---
i voted.
---
Not sure what ANY of what you said has ANYTHING to do do the FO 1st.... Players will do that to ANYONE. Those that embrace the Raider marque will make a point of it and then go grief your base. I recommend that you get off the FO 1st hate train and just play the game.
---
I try and stash any glands I find (and other parts) so basically my daily consists of just walking over to the scout.
---
I'm a fo1st subscriber. Don't make it free for everyone. Thats all I'm saying. Free private servers would bury the public server playerbase.
---
True, and sad.
---
My expectations about no bugs are probably gone forever tho.
---
No
---
Yeah but it doubled the junk they got
---
You are scused, Maryland needs a kick in the ball anyway
---
Whales are stupid af, nothing we can do about it
---
Warframe doesn't have a subscription, and it's just fine without it. Everything that affects gameplay in any way is accessible to every single player for free. This, imo, makes it the best mmo out there. As for Fallout's subscription, it's really ouf of place in a product that completely breaks if you sneeze in a wrong way near it.
---
Good idea btw
---
Yeah, was probably a glitch. I couldn't stim someone when they went down. I've been downed multiple times during this event and always random strangers stim me.did you go back for your loot and see if it was still there?
---
Warframe is F2P with no sub option and has no strictly p2w microtransactions.
---
A quick Google search for stats also shows that Warframe has 50 million registered accounts and over 34,000 concurrent users in the last 30 days.
---
Bethesda COULD make a good, free to play 76 if they wanted to. FO76 is also a game that most of us payed at least 30$ for.
---
Signed an FO76 apostate.
---
My order finally went through on the third day, still they never responded to my ticket so i canceled it cuz I have access now. Know whats funny though? They are going to rebill me on the 28th, meaning they are counting the 2 and a half days I had no access lol I am obviously canceling the membership before then. Hope you get your refund.
---
Nearly as fun as Big Bumpin
---
Sorry for the typo in the paragraph. "We can't understand a single thing"* voice to text is pretty garbage
---
It‚Äôs so you can‚Äôt have your FT into a trap to kill other players
---
Sorry about your luck! Personally I hang onto the extra glands (and Stingwing barbs which I have more trouble getting) and stash them to use anytime I get a ‚Äúdry run‚Äù like you‚Äôre having now.
---
I have some bad news for you...
---
That whole griefing 1st players thing is not true
---
You mean the cycling lights?
---
They were human former miners  forced to live underground, fused with the miner gear and became mole people
---
"Oh no, someone nuked my base... Oh look I fixed it with my infinate amounts of stored junk, no harm done"
---
My base is in the forest zone as I like that area, and I have passive mode always on as I'm not a big PVP'er so this "hunt the 1st members" is going to do nothing but give me some traveling companions and visitors to my bar and courtyard garden space üòÅ 
---
In all fairness I love the idea of an in-game civil war between the 1st members and non-members, they should have a Nuclear Winter game mode where it sorts you into those two teams, though I think based on the news out of Bethesda the 1st members may outnumber the non-members.
---
Yes, use the cycling lights and you can do that. Also light boxes. Both allow you to change colors.

---
Those perks are all essential for sniping. You need take a hard look at those for your build. You should not have 10 strength, that is a total waste and you will continue doing weak damage until you get agility and luck perks. 
---
Agility- 
---
Covert operative and mister sandman are the real power houses here. They will make up the bulk of your damage, escape artist and sneak will improve your sneak abilities. How much agility you have affects how well you can sneak, put a suppressor on your gauss as well. Adrenaline and gun-fu arent necessary but they can boost your damage even higher.
---
Luck-
---
Better criticals gives you a good damage boost, four leaf clover can keep your crit meter full, and grim reapers sprint will keep your AP bar full. Bloody mess is necessary for every build and everyone should have this perk. Starched genes is necessary for mutations, class freak is helpful but with riflemen its a trade off for better vats or less mutation side effects. 
---
Mutations- 
---
Get bird bones and eagles eyes at the very least, more perception and more agility are great for snipers. Marsupial and speed demon are universal and work for every build.
---
I know you wanna have a good carry weight, but strength is useless for rifle builds.
---
 Instigating is a good effect for gauss rifles and other sniper style weapons. Lever action rifles are really good.
---
Power armor is good but you can't sneak in it very well, and once you start getting good legendary armor it will become obsolete. The whole point of a sniper is not being seen, your not supposed to be tanky, your supposed to be sneaky.

I think you've misunderstood his post. He's saying how attractive FO1st and private servers are due to the way people act in public servers.

To be fair it does in FO3 and 4!

Pretty sure the number are kinda high due to them locking the Ranger armor behind to subscription.
---
I, unfortunately, see a lot of people buying into it just for that alone.  Then the numbers will drop massively until they lock something else behind it.
---
Well I recommend trying it's very good
---
LOL

Bethesda can‚Äôt get the regular game to work. I doubt any anti cheat would be effective.

Best option right here if you can make/afford it.

Instigating explosive with commando perks is my go to

Woahh I had no idea! Thanks!!

Yup, thanks!

I am a member and nobody griefed me lmao

That's what I said but the post gained traction so I wanted to set the record straight.

I'm more angered by the scrap box, annoyed at the tent and it being lacking really.
---
I don't feel a mmo style subscription is the right choice. I feel they should of made it unique, or just cheaper. Also no scrap box xD

I find your answer interesting. Why do you believe to would bury the public user base?

I did my part.

Nice try, let me filling the rest for you.

Extra reason for me to bypass that mode all together. Thanks for the tip.

I suspect the posts regarding "class war" originated from Bethesda shills in order to generate sympathy for the service and possibly sales through exposure and attention.
---
Bethesda has its claws all over this Reddit, and has many LOUD posters who defend them and their game relentlessly.   Lying over and over again, until people start to doubt the truth, has become the norm of business in the modern World.
---
‚ÄúWandering in‚Äù is great, spawning already inside is dumb. 
---
What a weird thing to defend. Maybe enemies should just magically appear everywhere, give all enemies the ability to teleport, after all, it‚Äôs the wasteland, man!
---
It‚Äôs a mixed bag but I definitely get more 3 stars now than I used to
---
Which level are you?
---
All those games you mentioned are MMOs with tons of content üò¨ 76 isn't even an MMO, it's an online action rpg, they want to lock game changing mechanics and non-persistent "private" servers behind a paywall, that's just a big scam and super scummy to me.
---
Yeah, it's really bad lately. I dont even know how I'm going to get through all the rounds it will take to get that skeleton costume.
---
because that way you can get hundreds of it in 1 go at one convenient location.
---
I do not know if this is still a thing after this patch but if you wall off any interaction points for the claim space / lockpickables no one can reach the claim and thus you will have the workshop for as long as you stay on without being flagged
---
All voted up. I'm interested to see the results, to see if they're what I think they'll be.

You might not be able to cheat, but I have definitely seen things I can‚Äôt explain. While in Spectator Mode I watched the eventual winner repeatedly jump up and down and kill people without missing a shot. I realize that just because I can‚Äôt do it doesn‚Äôt make it cheating, but damn, that level of accuracy with a controller?

Sounds great üëç
---
Everone else ran off the cliff
---
Yes but so can everyone else, probably why so said its not selling so well
---
This is why I bought mine.  I'm in a group of peeps and plan is one of us buys it one month and cycle it around so we have the pvt server for us but not all of us pay for our own, just share the payment of the subscription.
---
Can attest that most events are SOOOO much nicer when it's a pvt world and the group allows everyone to get a hit on legendaries so all can get one.  Worth it for 13 bucks once every 7 months (how we currently have our share pay model set up)
---
Yeah its my fault
---
Except I paid money for a game that is still broken in many ways , and their answer is ‚Äúgive us more money and we‚Äôll let you in on the stable servers that don‚Äôt crash and access to unlimited storage‚Äù and if you think they‚Äôre gonna stop there just wait till they start selling weapons to fallout 1st subs , they already said the fu1st subs will have access to ‚Äúexclusive atom shop items‚Äù meaning you‚Äôre paying for the right to pay for more .
---
Ok neo nazi

My dude the jumbo mr Fuzzy is sold for 25k because people don't want to accidentally scrap it.

Pharma Pharma thru the asylum.
---
On the server I was on recently someone dropped a nuke on a player with the fallout 1st icon. So I'd say there is a class war right now over 12 bucks a month üòÇ

I do too... I somehow scrapped them today I guess.. though I don‚Äôt even remember taking them out of my stash

PM me your prediction?

It's always been "Millions" but even I doubt that 76 is that popular.

Yes.  This.

Honestly.... dishonest sales tactics. Because when you hover over my camp it will show I have a ton of things for sale but when you get there you realize that 90% of my inventory is wood.

and this here is why i started one shotting everything not caring if some people get loot, because it usually got me killed üò¥

Are you really comparing fo76 to a f2p game that costs nothing to play with a 60$ game??

Applogies your highness, but in the words of a Detective I once new, 
---
If you didn't want it opening you should've put a better lock on it (or a lock to start with!) üòù
---
You've also, outside of the rpg mmo arenas, titles like World of Tanks. Which use a Subscription system in addition to a mix of cosmetics and P2W mechanics(special ammunition, exclusive gold tanks). They are everywhere with games that update frequently. Even Star Wars Battlefront 2 appears to be using the Crystal currency system tied in with skins to add a revenue stream to continue content addition. Maintaining a game with patches and what not is routine and included in budgetary needs. Large Scale content however is not so easy to fund without a revenue source to actually sustain the development
---
Well.. if those people actually had a life &amp; didn't spend all their time playing video games, they might wonder out into the real world and develop a basic understanding of how an economy works and what not to do.
---
They're also probably the ones crying about Fallout1st and how unfair it is.. while trying to sell a 78cap Stimpack for 300caps.
---
Bethesda‚Äôs fallout games aren‚Äôt bad but RPG-wise they don‚Äôt even come close to FNV or TOW. honestly Beth should be ashamed to call their games RPGs after TOW released
---
Also you should be ashamed for supporting their horrible business practices, you are a sucker for buying into f76
---
No that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying. They could of graffitied the walls and collect the candy or even forked the lawns. I don‚Äôt agro the robots as you don‚Äôt need too, until the boss. What I‚Äôm saying is stop sitting on the side lines waiting for a reward when you‚Äôve done nothing to help.
---
Fallout First doesn't give any subscriber any new DLC type content to hold them off.
---
It's hard to know what is intended and what is a bug with this game lol. All I know is you get an extra 100lbs carry weight when launching the game compared to entering the Excavator PA in-game.

With this gane thatd be a bad idea would probly bug at nobody would get them

They scramble over to the sentry bot to loot it before it blows up, in my experience. Sounds like another First Citizen taking normal server relations and acting like it's because of the subscription.

---
I‚Äôll put a dirty sleeping bag on the ground in front of the tent haha
---
What he's saying is that players like those are the reason why people are buying subscription. If you're on private server, you won't have to deal with any of them
---
I also notice you didn't mention LoL, path of exile, Guild Wars 2, minecraft, Diablo 2/3, ark, dayz, etc. All online games that get updated regularly and cost nothing. Hell, most don't even have mtx, such as minecraft, Diablo 2, ark, dayz.
---
To be blunt... and? 
---
My post was simply to point out that the target audience of reddit tends to be younger (And on a video game sub, mostly male) and that the survey results won‚Äôt necessarily mean anything for better or worse. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt asking for every other old gamer to tell me their opinion.
---
Well, having played Warframe since it's early days, I can say it is, and was back then, a better game than f76 from a technical perspective by a longshot. Moreover, it grew from a simple co-op shooter to a very ambitious content-filled space mmo that puts some AAA projects to shame. All that while staying subscription free, non-p2w and f2p. Fallout is ambitious, sure, but for now, it has nothing close to stable technical and community bases to build those ambitons upon, and Bethesda's shady tactics and fuckups only drive players away from supporting the game actively. 
---
Warframe may seem p2w to some (mostly beginner) players, but I can say from experience, that every significant item is obtainable for free if you put in time and effort. Sure, DE isn't innocent, they have their failures and their lies, but it's nothing close to what Bethesda's doing time and time again with Fallout.
---
I have faith in F76, even after all it's done to prove me wrong, but Todd really needs to rethink the policy towards the community.
---
Indeed. As suggested,enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Sent. üòä
---
It done
---
What is an "update" DLC?
---
Update = the game has to be updated to play it. Everyone plays the same version of the game
---
DLC = optional additional content, people play different versions of the game depending on which DLCs they have, if any
---
Have you tried bloodied? It's fantastic with the right perks. Unyielding armor gives +15 to all your stats and that alone is worth it. I run around with 35 perception and agility gun-fu vatsing everything to death from total stealth.
---
If not, instigating lever actions are the best from what I've heard. Fireproof or dense torso mod makes the bats easier to deal with with. They do effectively zero damage from the sonic attacks.
---
If you do switch to anything that has auto recievers, its best to switch to auto because the dps is unmatched. While the gauss rifles, hunting rifles and lever actions are good snipers. 
---
Do you use stealth? Covert operative and a few agility perks will boost your damage a lot if your not using them.
---
Which also proves nothing as that‚Äôs just anecdotal evidence of yourself
---
There's one for workshops, probably what you saw
---
Tl:dr version is that he messed up his paypal account because he was trolling people and accepting donations on his own actual name and account or ripping people off and now blames politics for his own shortcomings and can't buy atoms using paypal.
---
I answered.  I'm curious what the results will be.
---
Yes, and? 
---
Point being is that if they see a big dip in subscribers after the first month they‚Äôll probably start adding in more things to it to make month 2, 3, 4, etc just as ‚Äòworth it‚Äô as the first month

A Fallout 76 schmuck trying to say that other games are not worth the 60 dollar price? The idiotic irony is delicious

Then complain your pet keeps killing itself

I  live in Canada. I was able to get a refund back in January. I had  multiple issues with the game. Glitches galore. Constantly crashing. I  submitted tickets. They always blamed it on my end (ie, my 8gb video  card didn't meet the min. requirement of 2gb). I got fed up after  realizing that their support staff were about as smart as a tree stump,  and called my credit card company (pre-ordered the game). I had heard  that some credit cards offer a 90 day period for refunds. Spoke to the  representative. Explained everything, told him the game was dam near  impossible to play and I didn't think I received what they had  advertised. Since there was no contact support phone number, or direct  phone number to call bethesda he found one associated with whoever  accepted the payment. A company called Digital River. I guess they  handle all online transactions for them? Either way, it was no luck  calling them.  
---
The credit card company issued a  charge back, and  would let me know if they wanted to dispute the charge back. Get an  email a few days later from Digital River issuing me a refund.
---
The  funny thing is, Bethesda is so goddamn stupid, my account is still  active.  Every now and then I jump on to play. But still encounter the  same problems I have had since day 1. But after all the lying from them,  and this Fallout First stuff, I won't be playing anymore.
---
Well now I‚Äôm curious about this too. Consider this my ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù sticker.
---
I don't find sampling from Reddit a good indicator of much.
---
I agree with just about everything you've said with one exception: the amount of content. And my comparison would be another Zenimax title - Elder Scrolls Online.
---
Having played both games at launch and struggled through despite a lot of controversy and negative backlash, I'd argue the level of content in ESO compared to FO76 is laughable. Even at launch ESO had a ridiculous amount of varying zones and environments, dungeons and encounters for single players and groups, and endless quests with interactive NPCs. It had a lot of issues and it took them a lot of time and updates to get things right, but the amount of content justified the subscription model.
---
Personally I subscribed for 1 month to give it a chance, but it honestly doesnt allow me to do anything I could not already do before subscribing, with the exception of store unlimited junk and an extra tent that I've used a handful of times. I believe that if FO76 wants to maintain and improve their player base, subscriptions, and reputation - they need to really focus on solving bugs that have been around since launch and add in a good amount of content.
---
You know what's even cooler than that?! Getting disconnected right before the "elite whitesprings security" is killed!
---

---
So FIRST you assume I live in the US.

SECOND you assume I live in AUS.

---
In any event ... no one cares about your thoughts.
---
That wasn't you that died with me last night, because our third teammate didn't pay attention to the entire group of 4 with marine armor on the ridge above us and kept putting down portatoilets and actually survived by hiding in one, was it?
---
Most players don't know that building items makes noise lol.... and grenades hurt.
---
MightyBethesda, no they do not. That is all.
---
Should‚Äôve had an option for planning on getting it
---
I've played the series since Fallout 1, they've all had their positives and negatives. Fallout 4 and 76 had too many changes though, from perks/skills to repairing/scrapping to world building. They should have used those resources to fix bugs, add items, expand the world, and create more quests.
---
The story of 76 is great so far and there is lots to explore. I don't understand the complaints over lack of NPCs. I'm only about 30 hours in and just met Rose, but I don't see myself playing much after I beat the main quest line and most of the side quests. Updates and seasonal events will probably get me back, along with weekly free items in Atom shop.
---
Rule number 1. I snipe it from ontop of the rooftops. I wait a minute before I go to loot it because people always die after the event. Its guaranteed. And yes, they will crowd your body like vultures if you die.
---
There is a HUGE difference in the amount of content available.  Quests, map area, the way loot is obtained, amount of dungeons, even the ability to interact with the environment or explore caves is lackluster.
---
Hell, we can't even go explore in all the sewer grates.  We have burrows and that's it.
---
It's content.  That and being lied to.
---
If we actually got what other games give for the sub, players would be happy.
---
Instead, we get bugs and lies.
---
Lol why would I be
---
I answered.
---
Not a fucking chance in hell.
---
I feel like you‚Äôre going to have very skewed results with this survey. Undoubtedly, you‚Äôre going to have people voting who don‚Äôt even play the game anymore, but still follow the sub. That would completely throw the results off as you won‚Äôt know who still plays and who doesn‚Äôt. It kind of defeats the accuracy of the poll, even if we are just talking about people who use Reddit.
---
Cause I'm broke and I don't want to pay. Who's with me? Rise, Reddit! Corporate scums get what deserve
---
Same here. I think it's a bug. Ive had plenty of armor broken before that but not recently
---
Are you saying you wouldn‚Äôt buy weapons if Bethesda sold them in game?
---
L96 i was using a furious shotgun
---
yup.  my money, my choice.  get over it
---
How many stars and what‚Äôs your dmg output
---
It wouldn‚Äôt skew the data because the point is just to see how many people subscribed vs how many did not. Even if you only did it temporarily, it should still count.
---
Check
---
Is there anything confirming 79 is connected to wastelanders? 
---
Vault 96 is on youtube and are supposed to be raid.
---
Then theres also vault 63 in ash heap. Dont know anything about that tho.
---
I ran out of ammo halfway thru the greenhouses. Couldn't craft more as I had no plastic...
---
 No White Knight...that wouldn‚Äôt be it.
---
Will have to double check. It might actually be a verrrry slow decline as some said. Maybe the armor is at 98% or something. 
---
Am definitely enjoying it though!
---
Things don't change or improve by being silent and ignoring it. That's not how we got rid of online passes. That's not how we changed the Xbox One's original concept. That's not how we changed Battlefront. That's not how we got several nations against loot boxes.
---
We need to be vocal, angry, and tell these companies that their bullshit is not ok. That's how change happens. I do not share your defeatest attitude about things.
---
Lol you've got me confused with someone else. I've never assumed you lived anywhere. I called you a liar because i showed you it cost 150$ in AU hours before you resorted back to claiming it was 120. Lol
---
Yo votee
---
3*, about 134 damage
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt played Warframe. To say it‚Äôs not as ambitious is a fucking joke. 
---
All you have to do is look at their announcement videos  of the new free content coming. 
---
And it has an actual story.
---
I mean yeah, I'm gonna do that too. Enjoy your Irish zoo's lol.
---
Idiotic irony?? First off you don't even know who i am? The fuck? Second off I don't even support fallout 76s moves nor have I played the game since this Fallout 1st shit. Third wtf does that have to do with my opinions of another game listed in this post that he said he was going to buy? Get the fuck outta here. Calling me a shmuck when you don't even know my views of the game to begin with and assumed I'm a avid supporter.
---
Idk if you were bugged that‚Äôs fairly low damage for ‚Äúendgame‚Äù stuff like the vault raids
---
Hiding in portatoilets? That's hilarious and genius at the same time.
---
agreed
---
Most people charge WAY too much for anything, like how long do you want it to sit there before you squeeze an extra 1k out of that item?? Sell cheap, sell fast. Also some people don‚Äôt know a good deal if it smacked them in the face. I was selling a full set of T51 Plans for 18k and got a message from someone saying what a ripoff..I can sell those plans for 5 to 7k each any day of the week, double what I was asking for them
---
That's a shame. Will be hard to get anything to compare the data to in that case. But, the raw data can still yield some telling information. Afterall, 50% is still half regardless of how many people there are in the equation. Half the Redditors who respond to the poll would even likely make up a wide enough variety of types of people to make for a good mock setting.
---
For instance, it's a safe assumption that if the outcome is 75% of Redditors on the poll have 1st? It would be a safe assumption that the total pool of ALL players who have 1st is at minimum a majority. Maybe around 60 - 80%, since you'd have to compensate for a bit over and a bit under. A wide range for sure. But it tells you that a majority of players have (statistically) purchased 1st, even if just to try it. Or, the opposite. Or even, a balanced 40% to 60% estimation, making it seem like things aren't favoured to one side or another. Estimations without comparison still makes for good data though.
---
League Of Legends = MOBA  
---
POE = Boring and unengaging. (Played it for what seemed to be 2 or 3 hours)
---
For the others, I can't argue anything since I haven't played those, but as far as I know, Guilds Wars 2 is tab target combat, auto attacks, and such.  ARK and Dayz are survival games that make you lose everything upon death, imagine paying a subscription for that kind of content?
---
I just find it funny that a game that thematically attacks classism and openly ridicules corporate greed, and the ignorant debasement of the working class by the wealthy self-entitled privileged born in money, potentially has a bunch of whining wealthy players who feel that they are somehow being picked on, simply because they are told to feel that way on Reddit.
---
Its a stroke of marketing subterfuge, IMO.  No neck beard required.
---
I completely agree the amount of people who just shoot in the air and kill people through walls/ on the other side of the map is ridiculous. Theres sometimes where I might think theres an airboat here or there but the people who can just find a gun and shoot in the air and kill you is what pisses me off the most. With aimboters there's at least some chance you can kill them, but these other people just  win any game they're in without trying.
---
crazy paradox there 
---
however, calling someone a liar is one thing, proving it is another
---
Karma's a bitch.
---
No its just bad.
---
thx :)
---
I voted No

This would never work. In a company, there's Need to know info and info you're allowed to make public. CMs are not allowed to sit and tell you that so so the ceo of such is cheating on his wife and needs the 1st income for his alimony.  
---
The sad fact is all companies function somewhat this way, unless you're privatized (or Gearbox for that matter, Randy a big a-hole in general)  
---
Public companies have stocks that go up and down, and when you're a company owned by another company, you have to listen to them (Obsidian would have Outer Worlds epic exclusive if not bought out by microsoft)  
---
People blame todd and pete because todd is Executive producer (meaning he's pretty much the decider of what goes into a game or not) at Bethesda Maryland and Pete is the VP of GLOBAL marketing (meaning he's responsible for marketing all bethesda made and published games), both of these guys are also public faces of the company, unlike people like Altman (CEO of zenimax).  The gaming industry is disgusting yes, but companies owning companies and companies being privately owned or public corporations/companies is part of any industry in America.  
---
Developers oftentimes do not get chances to talk to higher ups, todd and pete notwithstanding as they aren't really higher ups, just two people from the main branch of bethesda who have big jobs. The Devs at the austin studio likely have their own Exec producer or talk to todd in Maryland to figure out where things should aim to head direction-wise and where to.  
---
Most developers probably like their situation, unlike some (Avellone went freelance after Fallout 2 and doesn't work at Obsidian, maybe cause of their CEO).  
---
To regulate the industry, it must regulate itself or be facing enough problemes with being deregulated that the government needs to step in, which is the same reason why lootboxes are only being looked at now despite years of issues and outrage. The US government is largely hands-off, it's very free market in america, the only regulate when it's at their hands, which is often when the deregulation leads to toxic unconsumer behaviors. To set a rule that says, You must be a shareholder who likes the Bethesda games output, would also lead to critics lambasting whoever regulates the industry or the industry itself.

Just turned 50. Been playing fallout since 1997. Things were great until recently. I know Fallout has been abusive to me and cheats on me lately, but I  love it too much and I hope things can be the way it used to be. ;)
---
Vampires, FFR, +50% VATS critical dmg.  You cannot really be harmed as long as you keep shooting enemies, other than by radiation.
---
That‚Äôs some serious heavy petting, bro.
---
To be honest, I have not had any game breaking bug that makes me feel I was cheated out of the initial price. Server crash? Just reboot, progression saves on exit, I only find it annoying when in an important situation, otherwise it's whatever. And anyway it doesn't occur as often as it used to.
---
Bloodied 25 faster fire rate 25 less vats ap  is best.

You say... While clearly on an active subreddit of people that play it.
---
Yea me and the other guy that actually hid, kept doing the come here emote.  The guy putting down the toilets had a perfect row of 10, and as soon as the grenades went flying, he went hiding........ and survived lol
---
You should consider posting this on other platforms other than Reddit. You might be missing a whole other demographic of players that don't use Reddit.
---
Craft lowest possible lever, scrap with your int as high as possible (drugs, unyielding √≠tems, +1 int equipment) and equip super duper perk, because there is a chance you'll craft two for the price of one.
---
Some √≠tems and mods are a bitch, whatever you do. Radium rifle and lever action rifle are really resource consuming. You can scrap twenty and learn one mod. Or no mods at all.
---
Hahaha no, but I actually have done the hide in portapotty thing before. Usually only early in the match if no one else is around.

79 was largery in the promotional images for Wastelanders on the roadmap and elsewheres, and I believe datamining found it was being added as well.

This week is the least beginner friendly, imo. Hp regen is a bug, and if I understand it correct, its when dmg (client side) is denied server side lol. For whatever reason.

 Just buy Fallout 1st, for the Atoms of course. ;)

Dude, that was fucking awesome.

Normally I'd agree but I could see the damage being taken then magically springing back up. It was like it was discounting all but 1 pellet
---
I dont have a lot of presence elsewhere. If there is someplace you think the poll could be posted please go ahead and do so with my gratitude.
---
Ah, yes. My bad, forgot about that part.
---
Rofl, so if its one you aim its survival and doesn't count, and if its is an mmo you tab target doesn't count(even though you literally listed wow which is tab targeting...)
---
You only played an hour of poe? So you literally didn't even leave the tutorial zone, yet claim it's boring. Could say the same thing about fo76 being boring because the forest zone is boring.
---
Also, poe is. Free game, once again comparing free games to a 60$ title.
---
BGS has Maryland (Working on Starfield then TES6 which is why they stopped helping Austin after a while), Montreal (Working on TES: Blades and FOS), Dallas (Which is supposedly the VR studio), and Austin (Working on 76)
---
Zenimax has one studio working on one game that is like warcraft and will have multiple expansions in the future.
---
You dont even get the benefits of a gasmask from that :/
---
I‚Äôm a console player
---
Great idea, I‚Äôve seen conflicting numbers myself. Looking forward to the results!
---
Dude buying atoms is absolutely not mandatory. You don‚Äôt need to buy every single outfit or bundle that enters the shop.
---
Criticism of billing is fine, not sure why you bring politics into this..
---
Idk you could have been damage bugged but since it was your first time doing the raid and your weapon isn‚Äôt the best maybe try upgrading to something stronger and trying again, try again and see if you get the same result before upgrading though
---
Pairofdice
---
Good luck with this, and I hope it gets traction and makes a difference.
---
I never said anything about how much it cost in AU.
---
Those are words you put into my post that just aren't there.  You wish they were there, because without them there, your response has no merit.
---
But whatever, again, no one cares about your opinion.
---
And what you said exactly shows how unimportant Fallout 76 is for them lol
---
I voted and the reply is good for exposure
---
Oh man, still not fixed...well at least I know what to stock up on now. Radaway, rad x, ammo, teamamate who doesn't strop and throw a grenade at me when we lose...
---
I stopped using my shotgunner because of that bug. Instead of causing lets say, 200 damage, you cause 180 and 160 bounce back, so you really caused 20 and you need to shot ten times for a kill,. Whatever the distance, whatever you do. 
---
Until they fix it, shotguns are only good for crippling with Enforcer perk.
---
Boop
---
Thanks. I bought it for $15 on xbox. Can‚Äôt wait to start
---
If or when they give 1st dlc content, get ready for a new wave of youtube clips üòÑ
---
Ok
---
just... put it in your box
---
I would be if they added good end game content. So far they haven't added one thing since launch that is worth doing. Nothing feels rewarding in this game. Player vending was the only thing that kept me playing for a long while.
---
Fuck the haters. I bought the game and can‚Äôt wait to start
---
Yeah try dealing with it when you one shot everything, I have to hit something 5-6 times sometimes before it dies
---
Yeah I made a few to test it and you‚Äôre absolutely right. üíÄ
---
Like I said, it's been out for a year. Give it 2 or 3 years and we'll have a meaty Fallout online experience.
---
I stopped reading and missed the tin foil hat comments. Yikes.
---
Bought it for super cheap. Thanks
---
Multi-shot weapons seem to be bugged. Shotguns do this in private servers too, at least in my experience with them.
---
The flechette harpoon gun also does this if the shots don't do enough damage to kill the target. Something I've noticed is that shooting an explosive flechette harpoon gun at the limbs of scorchbeasts seems to do more damage than shooting at their heads.
---
You claimed it cost 120$ in response to someone saying it is as expensive as f1st for them. So you literally tried to claim it didn't when you are demonstrably wrong.
---
know any good light box tutorials?
---
Its a tactic, glitches or not, people ride events and do not participate.
---
It happens in meat week AND mischief night.
---
Actually seeing griefers now and people blowing up cars before the are suppose to in an attempt to reduce the lag so many complains about.
---
Voted, can‚Äôt wait to see the results
---
I like servers full of people. Sometimes they steal your loot, sometimes they revive you.
---
Just did the Census Violence Event at the NAR Repair Yard outside Watoga with 5 Mirelurk Kings, 6 Feral Ghouls and 3 Super Mutant Warlords.  Used my Vampire .50 cal and had no problems but was thinking how tough it would have been w/o the Vampires .50.
---
Voted, actually I have to thank Bethesda for this, I probably wouldn't have bought the Outer Worlds if they hadn't come up with this "service"
---
yeah every body on here madddd madddd haha, everybody sayin ‚Äúgo get a fuckin economy class üë∫‚Äù y‚Äôall have fun gettin ripped off
---
Ya speaking of those pesky lever action gun mods, has anyone ever found a suppressor mod for purchase or as a loot drop? I‚Äôve scrapped quite a few lever guns and have yet to learn it.
---
Doneüëçüèº
---
I get mildy miffed at how much YTers take from reddit without doublechecking shit.  
---
It's why people believe that due to 1st, there's some class war going on in 76, when it's a small blip if anything.  
---
Reddit can create myths, there was that whole trade-steal exploit myth.
---
Could be... I can't remember the last time I had to repair armor with any of my characters. And I have been being hit a lot (and killed) lately because of Mischief Night.
---
I don‚Äôt but YouTube is typically the go-to for these things. I prefer using the cycling hanging bulbs but it all depends on how you‚Äôre using the light.
---
Ye, I had a team we could do normal 1-2 ppl doing mechanics on normal and 3-4 doing mechanics on expert. But lot of ppl have stopped playing üòï
---
So we should buy the game and pay a subscription in hopes that 3 years down the road it becomes the game it should have been and gets handled properly like other games do?
---
So there are pink bats at the top of the world?
---
ah ya I'll look it up, though you might know one off the cuff.  good hunting and thnx
---
True, this is the economy between nations has always been a complicated issue (honestly I hate it) but at least we know the differences between some (in my country Guatemala, the standard game Fallout 76 costs Q.900, which in dollars equivalent to $ 112.65, everything here is much more expensive in physical)
---
‚ÄùTrade steal exploit‚Äù? Tell me more
---
Edit. Nvm just googled
---
You're doing it wrong.  You have to write that with a smarmy tone.
---
Funny thing. Pirate costume Is the only one I have. Twice. The rest are all those civil war pieces you can find easily going to museums.
---
If your want another I‚Äôd give you one
---
Ah, I see you've confusing 'on my team' with 'on my side';)
---
Not really. Do you not understand that companies often have to focus on the product they are making one at a time?  
---
Maryland can't help Austin because they are working on Starfield and TES6 (Two singleplayer games they only really announced so there wouldn't be uproar that Bethesda wasn't a singleplayer game studio anymore), Montreal is working on Blades and Fallout Shelter (Still gets constant updates, bugfixes and new seasonal events), Dallas is the only one where there's little to no detail on what they do or what they are doing. On the Zenimax sdide, they have ONE studio dedicated to working on ESO (Which would need fixes, patches, seasonal and random events, and new expansions such as Summerset, Black Marsh, etc)
---

The subscription is optional. If you havent bought the game, why are you arguing here?

"I died and lost my virtual junk! I am taking this one to the sub reddit!"

Shame this poll didn't have all the answers it should have.  
---
No, and I stopped playing months ago. Should have been an option.
---
Thank you! Was missing only a couple bones and they were all on the table!
---
Sigh, ah well switching to rifles then. Shame, shotguns have served me well.
---
From what others have said, bethesda has reportedly say (I don't believe so myself) that with 1st money rolling in, they'll push Wastelanders earlier.
---
Im sad i never got to play that
---
You're crying in the rain. I've been playing several hours every day on PC since release (of both 76 and NW) and this is something we've been combating since the very beginning. They actually disconnected all the known aimbotters at once which tells me they're at the very least keeping track of who is cheating.
---
the gaming industry is so proud of you dude
---
RNG baby. Gotta love it. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I have plenty of caps to burn. 
---
I think I have extra fireman‚Äôs costumes and hats. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the minority or not but I really enjoy this event.
---
Nope. They have said that they have some more QoL stuff planned and with 1st giving them more funding, more shit can be done.
---
I‚Äôm doing my part! ...by not subscribing to Fallout 1st
---
I have, I'm arguing the point that the subscription in the game's current state is a terrible idea.
---
I play it as is but that doesn't mean I love everything about the game.  I want them to give us something better if they're going to put out a sub - starting with fixing bugs and making quality of life improvements.
---
Maryland is the most financially profiting studio and is working on the next Elder Scrolls and Starfield. Zenimax isn't gonna sell off what profits the most.
---
10k if you ps4
---
I'll subscribe when hell freezes over and Bethesda releases a game with the same graphics and lack of bugs as Outer Worlds.
---
lol you dont have to do the mainframe cores, you can skip right past those by placing your power armor on the other side of the pile of boxes where you exit the reactor room. you can still hop into the ceiling from the first room straight to launch prep as well but at least the power armor way doesnt go outside the map.
---
I have at this time voted on the survey given by OP.
---
 I totally would but I‚Äôm on Xbox. These caps are burnin a hole in my pocket. Haha
---
Bethesda released a broken, bug filled, empty game with no content or balance. Loads of false promises and microtransactions. Now they want $100 a year for their half assed mess. Whoever pays for this betrayal of a game deserves all the bad they experience. Lifelong fallout fan, own every game. This not a comment on the community. While they are sad delusional brand loyalists, they are very friendly helpful and knowledgeable about the game.
---
Look up mappalachia, there's a bobblehead, magazine and capstash map. I start at Poseidon and make my way east, kill the two Grafton monsters, all the way to BW mine and then ft up to Morgantown and get those. It's about 1k a day
---
Voted like a man who has the constitutional right to do so.
---
You are fortunate. I've gotten blue screens and servers crashing.
---
r/FO76 is a sizeable sample. It's unfeasible to try and ask every player so a statistician would go to taking a sample like this to try to see what the whole may be.
---
I LOVE Stalkers effect. It practically gives you a sure headshot, which can be paired with criticals and kill, kill, kill. 
---
My rifleman (dirty common army soldier) carries a Stalkers compensated combat rifle. It's great fun. 
---
If you are on Ps4 I can give you an anti-armor combat rifle I uses for weeks. Just find me a bunch of 38 ammo for my plinking Fixer.
---
Common bug happens all the time
---
Yeah. People and Youtube News Medias keep lying because of reddit shitposts.  
---
There is harrassment being aimed at 1sters, but no classism or war at all.
---
Took the survey!
---
It seems you are they one that do not understand, focus on a game, yes, but if they care they wouldn't attempt to make this game with just a handful of people and sell it.
---
Don't think that many people are crashing all the time. It just that ones that are having problems are incredibly vocal about it, especially on the internet
---
What console? I‚Äôve never crashed on Xbox One X, but my son in the same house has crashed multiple times on the Xbox One S.
---
Tried removing my roofs, still says "Exceeds maximum build count".
---
I don't want to move my camp.
---
This game is too buggy.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox One X too, maybe it really is a stronger console then
---
It checks out.
---
This post is too late. Literally thousands have already quit the game and sub
---
You try too hard.
---
Play outer worlds
---
13 a month is a big jump from free. $5 for private server access, sure. But they added the other qol utility shit to charge more money
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the main factor besides internet connection. It can handle the explosions and all that crazy shit on screen so much better.
---
Well first off, this game was originally from the getgo, Fallout 4 DLC and a experiment. Bethesda Maryland does not have multiplayer experience, their austin studio does (BGS austin was originally Battlecry studios, making Battlecry, a MP Hero shooter). Austin has people from SWGalaxies and UO (Ultima Online) as employees and developers.
---
If Bethesda didn't care, they would have left it to Maryland to develop a game that Maryland wasn't skilled in making or was able to make.
---
I believe you'll find VATs crit is far better for semi-auto builds than explosives. You  may find that +10% while aiming is also better than Explosive (it actually works even when not ADS.) Additionally, explosive damage like all damage) is reduced 70% on SBQ before her resistances are even added, so explosive loses even moreso against her.
---
Best mods for a crit build will be Hardened receiver for damage, Aligned barrel and stock, and Reflex scope for crit economy. Remember damage drops off with range, and plan your barrel modifications accordingly. You may find more value from taking the hit to AP economy and range to equip a suppressor on a rifle to remain in "caution" and use sneak attacks, or forego the suppressor to kick ass once you run out of bubblegum. YMMV.
---
If you don't like/can't use VATs crits, you're "stuck" with +10% while aiming and/or Explosive. I'd only use Demolition Expert perk if you also like grenades and/or mines.
---
Semi-auto excels at add clearing, but isn't (and will never be) best-in-class against bullet sponges. If you want to be good against standard mobs and keep sponges on lockdown while you make them do the sad face, consider a combat shotgun build, or understand that a Commando build can do much of (or more) of what a semi-auto build can do if you're willing to exercise a little trigger discipline.
---
For non-Bloodied AND Bloodied builds, on undamaged foes, Instigating is your best choice for alpha strike, even more so when paired with a VATs crit build. This will be more than sufficient for most encounters, and requires nothing other than a crit build and a 1\* Instigating lever or gauss. Keep in mind that Gauss can act fussy with VATs, and that Gauss damage is listed for a fully-charged shot.
---
For non-Bloodied, Junkies offers it's full effect right "out of the box" all the time, bullet sponge or no, with 5 addictions. It also works with a "Bloody Build" and synergizes well with it, including adrenal reaction mutation, nerd rage, etc. (additional effect of Unyielding armor is countering any stat loss from withdrawal.) Biocommesh can be nice for a chest mod for these builds, allowing greater chem economy, although you'll sacrifice your "Dense" mod slot. I'd personally use STR as a dump stat if you don't want to use Unyielding gear, and choose withdrawals that reduce STR, as no SPECIAL can be reduced below 1. Counter the carry weight with a backpack and marsupial +swapping in carry weight perks only when needed.
---
Furious would be the third choice here, for bullet-sponges. You'll need to hit 8 stacks for max damage, and changing targets will likely reset all stacks. It takes time to build stacks, so keep that in mind. If you're in a team/cooperative encounter, you may be adding more value by removing adds with an Instigating rifle, than by trying to DPS the sponge. Handmade may be a better choice if you like furious, due to it's larger magazine size.
---
Your best all around DR will be a Heavy Combat Armor Chest Piece combined with 2 Heavy Leather Limbs and 2 Heavy Metal Limbs. Your best all around DR with Rad Resist will be Heavy Combat Armor Chest Piece with 4 Heavy Robot limbs. Sentinel is nice to have, and powered as well for the extra AP - but think about how you want to play. If you play primarily PVE, even ONE Monster-specific armor piece will give you 30% damage reduction against anything of that type you encounter. That's arguably way more valuable (and cheaper) than finding Vanguard or Bolstering, because reduction &gt; resistance (and if you don't believe me, ask the SBQ how she feels about explosive damage.)  
---
If I am misinformed, or missed anything, let me know.

[Here is a sample Crit Semi-Auto Rifle Sniper.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3e345cf&amp;d=p00pd2pk2pp2pl2c72a72a00a30lr2l71l12lk2lv0lt2ao0an2ar2em1eu0sg2pr0ib4&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Crit%20Rifle)
---
Blocker helps when you get rushed. Cola Nut helps you heal without animation, Rad Sponge helps with carry weight. Demo Expert I added for you because why not? Action Boy/Girl is superfluous with Lone Wanderer, but necessary when in a team.
---
My main is level 130 I just want my alt to be 50 for my gear. I have already enjoyed the views like twice over so grinding is needed sometimes
---
Lol snacks, wut
---
We have to remember that reddit is a vocal minority for nearly every game. What the reddit community wants isn't always what the actual game community wants but reddit community often tries to force it anyway.
---
Of the copies sold and played, reddit is 200k of them. It was estimated that 76 sold 1.4million copies and has been free to play for periods so we could be seeing more like 2 million overall which would make reddit 10% of the game community. That's like 1 person in a group of 10 dictating what happens and what's OK.
---
Or they make it a pain in the ass to store.
---
It's 12.99 a month, or 8.33 if you get the full year
---
You are visiting the wrong machines. I add people who keep decent prices and become a regular. People do the same with me.

Here here!!

Would love to see more.

My apologies.  I did not read your avatar name.  I read your post as though it were replying to me, and not as though it was replying to the individual attacking me.
---
If it's just the glands you want / need, head over to Wade Airport and search through the meat bags. They always have the Bloatfly Glands and sting wing proboscis'
---
Gaming Youtubers and  Youtuber News media buy it fast. They don't verify sources at all.
---
It was one of the last mods I unlocked for the lever action, just gotta keep making em and breaking em down
---
Probably a First Citizen "survival tent" in your spot
---
I voted like a champ!!
---
Yeah this subreddit is good at taking 13 dollars and making it feel like you sacrificed half your wallet for a outfit, a box, a tent, and some emotes and icons.
---
It's also a logistical nightmare to go to the bathroom. With my costumes, I just have a zipper installed.
---
Eso and wow also started with sub fee idk about ff14
---
Wtf can even make a sentence that makes sense,  now it makes perfect sense as to why you got To fort 1st. Lmao by felicia
---
I'm not being serious to be honest. Zenimax would hold on to Bethesda with a iron grip.
---
Voted but I believe the survey needs more choices. Maybe some people haven't subbed yet but plan to.
---
Just do it and see
---
I accidentally "assume"d that you were the one that had attacked me earlier.  I did not read your avatar/tag before I replied.  My bad.
---
You can attack anyone at any time. But it most likely won‚Äôt do any damage to them unless they want to participate in PVP.
---
This poll will be skewed if you only get people from this sub to vote.
---
Yeah it's pretty open to interpretation I suppose. A pushy grandpa might be able to make his case.
---
I'd read up on a few cases where people had their PS3 consoles fail after 2 or 3 years. They'd successfully argued that a console is expected to reasonably last atleast that long and won at whatever court they were at. I had all this ready to present if it got that far, but thankfully it didn't.
---
The issue has stopped for me. But if they disappeared before it then they would still count
---
If someone contests the workshop then you are both open to PvP. You will get a notification if they do. Otherwise you are both immune to damage unless one of you has pacifist off and shoots the other giving them the option to initiate.
---
Thank you. I too think they did a great job with the statue. I think the actual creature in the game should've looked more like it!
---
Then no one would know they have it, which is really what's going on here I think. It's vendors used as display cases.
---
So how did this get brought up. Cause that is one weird drunk dare to do. Especially to continue doing it for 2 years.
---
Yep, the are real! The government stored TNT and ammo in the bunkers during WW2.  Very cool to walk inside of them!
---
You grind, do your normal deal or just hang it up until then
---
Random spawns on bosses. I found one during a horde event in the Cranberry Bog.
---
Ok Todd.
---
Unfortunately you are probably just shit out of luck.
---
What?! Someone isn‚Äôt complaining about the game?! Fuuuuuuuuuuu-
---
So slightly more expensive than light wood laminate but cheaper than a fridge. 
---
An in-game fridge is more expensive than the entire game. Yep. Nothing wrong here.
---
Good post. Well done OP.
---
It is annoying, but I did really well in economics  during my business degree. Just got to find in a different way.
---
I paid ¬£55 for my copy, I live in the UK. That's about $71.15 USD. 
---
It's normally cheaper here to buy physical due to people in the UK willing to pay more for digital.
---
The problem isn't the game.
---
The problem is the company behind it.
---
You can try to affect change by requesting companies change the game but until people stop playing, until they stop buying, until they stop falling victim to every shiny piece of shit game they slap together, they won't change.
---
Don't buy. Don't play. Move on.
---
Haha, I do agree. I just feel like it was supposed to be a perk of that armor based on the buff in the effects page. XD 
---
Either way the ultimate point I think we are both getting at is that there needs to be more effort put into addressing bug and being more specific about item benefits vs what is a bug/exploit. Doubt it would happen in this instance but it would suck to get banned over something like this thing because it's not clear. As opposed to people who were deliberately equipping and unequipping weight reduction gear to give them infinite carry weight.
---
Srsly, I've never seen people go this apeshit over paying 13 dollars a month. Can people fucking get over it already? It's getting stale at this point
---
üñïüèª, lucky Mf üòÇ
---
Voted! Great idea OP
---
I have a longer version of the story either in the comments here or on imgur but the TLDR version is:
---
-I build T-60 armor
---
-I get drunk with friends at DragonCon, one comments that I hit my peak and probably won't make another awesome armor like T-60 again.
---
-I get moderately offended and decide to prove them wrong (I also had no better ideas to chase at the time either).
---
-???
---
-Profit?!
---
Voted - DEMOCRACY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.
---
"I expect something decent" is the understatement of this entire game.

Ps4. And trying your luck Is part of the fun.

Any chance getting this featured somewhere? I'm just a proud older brother, sorry if i'm asking for too much :')
---
Thanks. I'll try that.
---
I wonder if the majority of people who vote are non 1st members simply because they‚Äôre upset. Kinda like with surveys for businesses: it‚Äôs only the angry people who bother doing it.
---
But a studio doing poor could be cut off at any moment.
---
Looking good.
---
Maybe try tweaking the hue a little bit or maybe use a aged filter?
---
 The thing about Intelligence is that you only really need 5. That's 5 Explosive for your explosive weapons and exploder legendaries.
---
 All the other perks are crafting perks and can be slotted when you need em', you don't have to carry them around.
---
I did it twenty times, more or less. Only one crash. But lagg and related issues are there, constantly.
---
Well I mean why complain about the things ya cant change?
---
Everyone has different struggles.
---
Well it would give an idea of how many people have Fallout 1st subscriptions on this subreddit. Considering this subreddit is the main communication channel for Beth (they stated that) then it would have some meaning to it.
---
IF you actually think there is a class divide in a video game and take it seriously you need to sort yourself out.
---
It was a joke..
---
If there are other sites you think this survey would benefit from please let me know!
---
Good to know. Imo the only reason to get F1st was for the unlimited scrap stash. But now junk is unlimited anyway. Ah, refreshing how the rich are taking care of the financially responsible.
---
Voted. I just want to add that the idea of this utter shit being anything other than a slap in the face that will just damage their reputation even more, and that it might actually be significantly profitable for them, is depressing. I truly do fear for Starfield and TES6.
---
Pay check signers run the show and wag all the tails.
---
I scrapped tons of things before knowing they were special. Just laugh and enjoy it. It Is a game.
---
Voted for my dad (he doesn't use reddit)
---
&gt;There's always plenty of people at the event that it always gets finished with plenty of time to spare, so that's irrelevant to bring up. 
---
Yeah  I can't remember ever failing the event.  Also, I'm mostly unaware of what others are doing/ not doing because I'm busy doing what needs to be done.
---
Are you in power armor, if so check your fusion core in your one step. If it's at zero drop it.
---
I votw
---
I absolutely fail to grasp their motive. I mean he will win that round effortlessly, and the round after it and all the others. It may be "fun" the first few, but then..? Just why?
---
A lot of people just parrot out memes like they're being clever, this isn't any different. Karma is worthless anyway. Say how you feel one day the post gets 20 downvotes, say the same thing a few days later you get 15 upvotes, it's pointless. What's annoying is when you state a fact and then it gets hidden cuz 8 idiots downvoted it
---
Ha, I guess this explains why I sometimes see players inside their camp spinning around and completely unresponsive?
---
Figured it was a glitch or something but it all makes sense now!
---
If you on Xbox I can mod one out for you
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt participate because it makes them crash, there‚Äôs been a lot of threads about it lately
---
So, you fell prey to what Bethesda wanted regardless‚Äî they offered armor at a premium price, and you ate that shit up. I imagine many would do it without the atoms.
---
Don't Ark, Dayz, and Minecraft all have paid private servers if you can't host your own (pc only). Minecraft also has plenty of paid packs. My friend pays $120 a year for his ARK servers.
---
From what I can tell, Fallout 1st is an amalgam of different subscription services (atom, private hosted servers, and skins).
---
Voted üí™
---
Wish I could get a refund and buy at that price.
---
You've never seen people get mad about being lied to? You've never been betrayed? You actively enjoy being extorted for money? I honestly can't grasp why Fallout 1st supporters are so dang toxic to people who disagree when Bethesda does something like this.
---
Last time I got in on a SBQ fight I got a drill :/
---
I voted wheres my sticker
---
Im not disagreeing with everything u said but what did he say that was wrong
---
Good idea, Bethesda will probably sell this one for 1,500 Atoms. Thanks in advance.
---
"Get windows 10 and play the game through Xbox" What does this mean..? You can't crossplay with xbox from pc - or am I missing something?
---
It has come to my attention that it is already in the game
---
Not the basement though.
---
If I‚Äôm not mistaken I believe you can. Not sure the exact way but I‚Äôm pretty sure if you have windows 10 you can play Xbox from your computer
---
Well yeah, you‚Äôre right.
---
Done.üëç

When they figure out how to make you pay more for them. Which you will thank them for.

Screw that

From other articles and posts I‚Äôve seen - older is basically anyone who is outside of normal college age or younger.  Or maybe more realistically anyone 30-35+
---
But then what?
---
Let‚Äôs say the majority are subscribers. So? What does that mean?
---
Let‚Äôs say the majority aren‚Äôt subscribers. So? What does that mean? Does that mean that Bethesda should just stop it?  
---
Is the expectation that this surve is going to act like some form of informal petition to go to Bethesda and say ‚ÄúHa!‚Äù ?
---
Edit: It‚Äôs also an open survey that anyone, people who don‚Äôt play, or people who never played can answer.  People who just hate Bethesda can vote and choose anything. Again, the survey doesn‚Äôt really amount to much.
---
&gt;Don't answer here
---
Everyone: \*answers here\*
---
Oh by the way, voted.
---
Vote or die motherfucker vote or die!!!!
---
Bethesda isn't doing any worse than other companies, there has be a decline in tec stock for a while which is why it looks bad. If Zenimax was to kill a company it wouldn't be Bethesda, considering their profits and the fact they own a publisher
---
I tend to get horrible runs of 1* loot every so often and then, just as I'm considering rage-quitting  I'll have a run of amazing loot drops and all will be forgiven
---
Uh the majority of users of fallout dont use reddit or official fourms. Your answers will not be anywhere near accurate. Plus your gonna get possibly more skewed from people who hate the game or bethesda. This is a stupid idea. I can vote as many times as i want using different ip addresses.
---
Voted, older gamer, don't really care about the "politics" of the purchase. I just want the content and private nuke runs are amazing.
---
So the answer to my final question is no, lol.
---
People complain about the complainers and I think it's kinda bullshit. Bethesda has lied to us, launched an extremely buggy game, and gone overboard with monetization in their games.
---
So yes, I agree. Don't stop criticizing Bethesda. Ever. Until shit stops. Paint jobs should not cost money, let alone $18. Games should not be this buggy. This company is a mess.
---
What people?
---
I did my part!
---
I'm talking about the phrase Ok Boomer which is used by teens about anyone older than 20.
---
Done so
---
OP is talking about cheaters in Nuclear Winter. Buying Fallout 1st does not give you a private Nuclear Winter server or offer any kind of protection in this mode.
---
There was a post I saved but I don‚Äôt know how to link it on mobile. I‚Äôll tag you in the post for now
---
Exactly thank you brother let's show what gamers can do! ‚úä
---
Because the game is still a smoldering dumpster fire?
---
Voted and upvoted

Answered.

Voted my dude

Damn sorry that post was just the nw rewards! Try using the search bar? There is a list for sure tho
---
Voted I did.
---
When it first came out, i thought the outfit would change month to month, and the NCR outfit was a big one to draw in a crowd.
---
Me too. But when I looked at the website, I don‚Äôt remember exactly, but the way they worded it, it seemed like it was a permanent exclusive. Am I wrong?
---
It just works
---
Hell yeah! People can spend their money how they want but it doesn't change the truth. Bethesda has made false promises time and time again. The Halloween items in total cost around 70 dollars alone. Do the math guys. There are barely any add ins that don't cost money, and the ones we get are WACK!
---
So many people have a sub in game it completely negates the vibe you find on reddit. I also find so many houses filled with atom based buildables. I can imagine why no one who enjoys the game or pays for stuff would want to keep silent in here.
---
Me i have a bunch of gripes with the game but i sub and pay for atoms and am over 35. Reddits been out for like a decade. Who would think its only for kids.
---
There are locations where you can camp that lead into natural caves.
---
The whole point of subscriptions is to keep people subscribed. It‚Äôs highly likely they‚Äôll rotate items in and out, other wise people will do like you said‚Äîwait a year, sub for a month, get everything and cancel.
---
Yah but ud think if u cared about ur product u would actually get some kind of demo product  i do think the extra health thing on the grognak costumes was ridiculous he went on about that alot
---
But still even if that were the case, it should have popped up that they won and kicked me out of the match as soon as the other two died. It never said Match Complete, so and so won.
---
Right? The prices are insane, especially for how much paid content to free content is released. It's basically soft extortion.
---
I just play the game normally and always have more than I need, in fact I pretty much never use them.
---
I heal purely with food and water.
---
That's awesome. Helmet looks t45ish but overall awesome. The work you put into it really shows.
---
I agree and disagree.
---
I agree that me need to make Bethesda hear us and understand, but i dont think its a good idea to flood all social media with the criticism.
---
Nothing, sad enough. They don't do item restores. You can try, but odds are it wont work
---
Well who can be sure with them of anything anymore.. but i interpret the post as "more will be added but nothing leaves"
---
If your not a 1st member you wouldn‚Äôt understand I‚Äôm afraid
---
That is how I saw it

Really it's all noobs and people who are used to spending that kind of money

As I understand it, AA is not working the way that it should. I have yet to actually confirm this and, do run around with an AA explosive Handmade but, the crew I hang out with in game who spend waaay more time in the game than I do, all say it
---
Then you totally misused the Mean Girls quote. 
---
Make fetch happen means trying to make a new phrase cool. Doesn't really work when the phrase is several decades old
---
Sounds like something my sister would do. But out of curiosity did you build the flamer as well or just the armor?
---
Only crashed once from it so far and it happened exactly when I pressed Alt+Print Screen on something in my inventory during it.
---
I voted. Interested to see the results.
---
I get sick of using a stimpack to revive sombody, just for time to run out part way through the animation and they die
---
Sure thanks for your valuable input and time /s
---
Fun fact i collect those
---
Haha, at least you were honest here about being dishonest
---
You can run your own servers for free as long as you run the server. I mean there are lots of third party server hosts for those games. But you don't have to pay anything for private servers. As for Minecraft having paid stuff, might be true on consoles, but java version of MC has zero mtx in it.
---
Lol okay.
---
If the event worked for me it be great.   I did it once,  then you goto do it again and you got assaultrons running around destroying everyone and throws you out of the event.   It done that twice to me now and a lovely blue screen from ps4

Lol played some.. Noticed the players at night are way better. I got totally wacked by some pro 140 guy he moved like a monkey.

‚Äòmandatory cosmetic items‚Äô

---
- I'm not asking for it to be free I think Bethesda should make PROPER Private servers and then sell them on monthly fee like Minecraft. Nothing else though. 
---
- You literally have no understanding of the gaming industry if you think no other game company will put a sub in their game if Fallout 1st is a success. If Fallout 1st is a success whatsoever then it hurts EVERYONE. How clueless can you be????

- You don't even know what anti consumer means if that's what you think anti consumer is LOL ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£

You're welcome for my service.

Absolutely out of control. I'm glad to see that not everyone has accepted it. Including politicians.

Do you always reply 170 days later?

Also, scorchbeast shitpiles have a good chance at having glands or probosces (and a small chance of barbs, too).

Defo not!!

That is *exactly* what I do :)
---
Edit: Damn, I should have PMed in another 170 days... I'm a failure.
---
.
---
it's amazing how people don't seem to understand that they are actively killing this franchise (and elder scrolls) by buying this subscription. 
---
you are spending money to enjoy an objectively worse game than all of their other efforts to destroy any chance at a better future in order to do a few shitty events a few more times. 
---
we deserve all of the horrible business practices that are coming our way.
---
It's important to understand that massive markdowns in retail are as much due to the nature of the retail industry as to the success of the game itself. Retail stores have finite space and a brand new game is almost always more valuable than a used one. Getting marked down to low values within a relatively short time frame is normal.
---
For stores that have little to no retail presence the prices are much more in line with the actual value (eg Amazon is currently $20).
---
Bethesda did mention that we will be notified when rewards change, implying that NCR armor or other stuff might not stay forever
---
I doubt persistent world's would be coming given how horribly the servers lag even without such mechanisms. Adding persistence would just add more server strain to servers that don't even run because of the existing strain. 
---
Honestly though, I'd imagine if they *did* somehow get persistence working, they would paywall it. They initially said they couldn't help the weight of storage regardless because of the method the database stored items, yet they then found a way to let scrap have no weight (which frees at least 300 lbs) once they paywalled it.
---
The same goes for preventing boots in your private server. The payment model for fallout seems to be "convinience" pay2win, and it'd be awful convinient to never get kicked.
---
EDIT : According to a comment below me, persistent world's *are* pay walled behind fallout 1st, so that's coming for people willing to pay more.
---
I carry 20 stims, which is more than enough. Thanks for the advice though.
---
Voted as well. I'll be interested in seeing the results.
---
For other companies, I would agree. But I don't see them budging an inch unless it's an absolute outcry. They have gone downhill extremely quickly. Don't harass PR personally, but criticize the company.
---
Good to know! Glad to know that I‚Äôll have time to decide when to get them!
---
That‚Äôs an issue with your build. I can easily solo everything short of the Sheepsquatch and SBQ, and my main isn‚Äôt duly optimized.
---
They've already said persistent workshops are coming to Private Worlds.
---
I'm not who you asked the question, but I would say it's because it would water down the amount of players in the main adventure mode because too many people should be on private servers
---
Haha get it? Fo76 bad TOW good
---
So from my understanding.
---
If someone buys and then say.. cancels or turns off auto re-new.
---
The player keeps the armour.
---
Also people say there'll be new variations each month or something like that. 
---
Also; it can't be NCR armour.
---
It's 84 years before the NCR is formed. 
---
Prolly alot longer before the NCR and Nevada rangers form together. 
---
It also on the armour says "CPD" on the left hand and left on the chest. 
---
Charleston police department. 
---
Lore! 
---
I can only confirm this is what America's riot armour looks like. 
---
Sorry, I just enjoy lore. 
---
The trench coat is just an added treasure.
---
Edit: it's on both hands "CPD" just really faded.
---
I am not a sub because I refuse to spend any money on this shit joke of a game. I haven't played since around launch and I was actually thinking about playing this game a couple weeks ago before they announced the subscription service. After seeing Outerworlds gameplay I craved a good rpg so I thought maybe I'd give this game another try, but after this subscriber thing I'm just going to cave and buy Outerworlds. fuck Bethesda they've lost all my faith.
---
We saw the day fo1st launched, this subreddit was flooded with people complaining. The next day, it was full of people complaining about them.
---
I'm not defending Bethesda at all, bit i feel that flooding things like this subreddit with complaints will burry the people actually asking for help with quests, selling/buying items and actual bug reports.
---
If anything, flood there feedback system
---
People already sub for a month and cancel for the icons, emotes and armour. 
---
You keep it. 
---
I have friends that have done it. 
---
You just lose access of the scrapbox
---
Thats why I play NW with 2 macro keys, anti-idle and rejoin new match. 2 keyboard keys and some ms delay, slow but gets the job done.
---
Who can run a server and also run the game? It's more cost effective to pay the rent for it, rendering your argument useless.
---
Yeah all that.
---
U sound squishy even in power armor if 3 ghouls are giving u issues. I have two bloodied sneak builds: commando and pistol. With both my builds I have no issues with dying because I'm never seen. I dont remember the last time I cleared out white springs and got detected or KO'd by ghouls. 
---
If u want a non sneaky sniper build atleast use the t51 power armor which has better damage resistance and maybe emergency protocol to help u sustain your hp when it gets low. U should post your perk cards, are u using "Blocker" n "lone wanderer"?
---
The only real factor to learning chance is your Intelligence, higher the better.
---
You have a point, but also remember that FO76 was built on the creation engine. It's a lot more unique, and also harder to code and program without it breaking all the time. That's my take on why FO76 started so slow.
---
Yes, you do keep rewards no matter what.
---
Also, I do know about the NCR appearing later. I too am a huge lore fan :-)
---
I didn‚Äôt see the CPD, but pre-war riot armor was my justification too! In fact, someone once suggested the armor be put in the Atomic Shop as pre-war riot armor, around launch!
---
Always glad to see others who care about lore, and don‚Äôt laugh off anything like NCR Armor appearing far too early, while at the same time just accusing 76 of being non-canon, which is BS.
---
We‚Äôre not getting ‚Äòripped off‚Äô. Because we know a single Stimpak isn‚Äôt worth 300 caps. 
---
15c is the most I‚Äôd pay if I was in a rush, and 10c is the fair average. 
---
Just because you‚Äôve run into price gouges doesn‚Äôt mean the whole economy is broken. It just means those people either don‚Äôt know what they fair price is or are trying to squeeze out more than its worth. 
---
There‚Äôs a blog that reviews the average prices from vendors and it stays pretty steady. The most successful vendors are the once that price slightly under and have a good location. 
---
I sell Stimpaks for 9c each. And I sell about 100-150 a day.
---
I mean, I take your point but that's a bit skewed. Playing for a 2 day free weekend doesn't make you part of the community, nor does buying the game, playing it for 5 hours and then never touching it again. Copies sold is not an accurate representation of the size of the community, the majority of buyers will have stopped playing a long time ago and have no investment in the game anymore and a substantial percentage of buyers won't have sunk more than a few hours into the game, whereas the users on this sub are actual fans. 12% of PS4 players never even left the Vault and 39% never made it to level 10.
---
Well now that I think of it I can tell you what‚Äôs the rarest or the sought after pieces anyways : fireman‚Äôs outfit, ‚Äúfire mans hat‚Äù (which we have established is not rare but completes fireman‚Äôs outfit),pirates outfit, pirate hat, jack o lantern short suit, jack o lantern pant suit, white springs jumpsuit.
---
Minecraft servers under 25 players use less than 2.5 gigs of ram. The game and server are both single threaded so as long as you have a dual core CPU and at least 4 gigs of ram you can easily run both. With zero performance hit.

Edited some numbers after double checking.

voted for ya baby
---
76 is so canon. It as so much lore to it. 
---
If the game is as worthless as people say. It's worth it for one reason.
---
Two if you like owning every fallout. 
---
The game is packed with lore. 
---
You really have to spend some time around the factions home and lay of the land to get the feel out it.
---
It‚Äôs a persistent glitch, usually if one has been killed near you and then you fast traveled. Happens with supply drop boxes too. 
---
Been like that for a while. It comes and goes.
---
What the other commentors have said, although in my case it's a third-party controller with a [turbo] function. My toon doesn't spin around in circles when I'm afk. ;-)
---
It did.
---
I got insanely lucky yesterday on a new character: The first mod I unlocked for the lever gun was suppressed and then I got two perfectly preserved pies first time I tried.
---
I was honestly shook after I got the second pie and quit for the night.
---
I don't know if being lucky over and over would do something bad and I didn't want to risk it.
---
Whilst generating more money can help that's assuming that money will be invested in the product in a way that benifits the consumer.
---
If it just goes to buying the suits more hookers it's not really helpful.
---
My situation is unique.
---
I paid for the year, but a day later my Microsoft account was hacked and Microsoft had to redo my account. Well when they did that, they ended up refunding my year of Fallout 1st, even though I didn‚Äôt request that, I told them what charges were actually bogus. I‚Äôm curious to see if it goes away after the month mark, or if it will go the entire year. I currently still have access to the 1st stuff. So time will tell.
---
&gt; kek
---
?
---
Does it hurt when you miss the entire point of someone's thread?
---
Yup I did the flamer as well, I think I got a few pics of that in the imgur build album.
---
Thanks for the leg work.
---
Not sure that the 2nd link backs up the assertion that servers were always going to be a paid services, although the first link does - the more interesting thing for me is it notes the way things are done in Minecraft... Because in minecraft you rent a private, persistent world that friends can log into even if you're not online. You have full control, including controlling the access list. I would suggest that while the idea of paying for a server seems to have been a thing earlier, the idea of what the 'server' actually is, has changed.
---
What 1st members are getting is a not-really-private, not persistent, normally recycled (as seen with pre-looted rooms and already killed enemies) server - ownership of which is revoked 15min after logging out. It basically asking you to pay for the free singleplayer mode of something like Minecraft or Ark.
---
I wonder if this was a technical choice to go the way they have, or was it a choice driven by accountants? I think people would have had less of an issue with 1st if it WAS, like Minecraft realms, a separate and private server that was persistent and controlled by the owner... but of course then (like Ark and Minecraft) just one member from a group would buy it and they wouldn't be able to sell a sub to every single user.
---
It saves space *for the majority* of junk.
---
The plastic cost keeps some people away. Also there was a bug that caused mods to be used before bulk, but not sure if that's resolved.
---
I think they missed the point of what the apocalypse is, instead of commies, bethesda is spinning it that capitalism is what will cause the end of the world.
---
P.s. Voted

I am not sure how much reliable the leaks are from that blog site, they could be speculation (for example, saying that Wastelanders is planned in February, but may be released sooner because of the extra funding, or later because of increased ambitions, essentially covers all of Q1). One can see in game though that many people did subscribe.
---
In my opinion, if the Wastelanders update is good, it would be best to use it as an opportunity to increase sales of the base game. To offset the bad reputation, there could be a free weekend at launch (enough to get people interested, but not enough to complete the story), possibly combined with giving one week or month of free subscription to anyone who buys a new copy of the game during or shortly after that period.
---
I'm doing my part

Maybe you had already seen this, but since you quoted it I had to look it up. It is some sage advice, for sure üòÄ.

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs that reddit is not real life, not even close actually.  So even if the poll is strong one way or another I feel in actuality that could mean nothing and may even be the total opposite

Persistent worlds are coming with Fallout 1st+, only an extra $50 a year.
---
You can get the recipe to craft Nuka Dark from the daily with Biv the drunk robot, the others can be found or purchased from the Nuka stand inside the whitespring resort.
---
them spending the money is not the point, the point is they are empowering Bethesda to do dirty, pay to win and micro/macro transactions as a norm in games now.
---
 So stupid. There's nothing wrong with the game. Its the players that are toxic.
---
Just space it out next time and not in paragraph format please.
---
I‚Äôm right there with you! I had so much fun with the story of 76, and it‚Äôs implications on the greater post-war (and pre-war) U.S.
---
Also, I happen to find the game fun anyways :-)
---
Fallout 1st is ruining their already abysmal reputation of paywalling, and cheaters are ruiming their already broken promise about battle royale.
---
Uh... As someone who loves this game and has played the living shit out of it, there is plenty wrong with the game. It's far from perfect.
---
100% agree.   LOL. This is my bush damnit!!
---
I stopped playing NW for this very reason. It's a pretty sorry state of affairs when it looks like nothing is being done about it. Have Bethesda even acknowledged it's a problem?
---
Just finished voting
---
Maybe change the title to "Are you a Fallout 1st Subscriber or not?" If I'm particularly upset by F1st, I may just angrily downvote instead of actually participating.
---
Voted because democracy is non-negotiable.
---
I've seen enough people with Fallout First in the game to know it's not unpopular, but that's just on Xbox so I'm curious about the other platforms.
---
Ah you must of just started playing FYI there's alot
---
I'm 60.  Is that old?  (Been playing computer games since 1977).
---
I don't have first, but have no problem at all with other people having it.
---
I wish there was a second question along the lines of "are you planning on purchasing or continuing a subscription?"
---
i voted
---
I am a subscriber and I voted
---
I‚Äôm honest. My character... well he says he is.
---
Also the sorority house next to the frat house (Morgantown south east of airport) upstairs there is a bedroom full of rare nuka colas.
---
For what it's worth, all of the friends I made on fo76 filthy casuals subreddit are all playing the Outer Worlds now.
---
What I could get the jist of is the NCR gear will stay as a 1st exclusive and each month in the subscription they will either be offered a skin plan or exclusive atom shop purchase for the various other skins for the NCR gear
---
But I'm not a subscriber, I paid for the extra stuff and canceled right away. Yes I technically paid for the month, but it would be skewing things to not note the distinction between those that will continue to pay the fee vs those that did it only for the extra bits.
---
"Blah blah blah someone took my junk I am upset"
---
FWIW I don't know what they're doing on filthy casuals because they banned me for having opinions xD
---
Even if we estimate that barely 50% of those 2 million are actually remotely invested, that still means this community is the minority. Even if we assume that 80% of players stopped playing, reddit is still the minority group. I don't have Reclamation Day achievement despite having a Level 74 account that even had a few wins in Nuclear Winter. So that 12% stat is messed by Bethesda glitches and so is that 39%.
---
Until 4 years ago I never joined reddit communities for games even if I played hundreds of hours in the game. Reddit is the vocal minority. There will be a level of overlap between reddit and the game's dedicated forum but they are the hardcore fans who go out of their way rather than just enjoy a game.
---
‚ÄúEverything short of‚Äù, then goes on to agree with me that it cannot be soloed like bugthesda promised.
---
Honestly I wish they would make the game free, if not forever just now and then.
---
I would still hate the subscription advantages but it would be way more understandable, and a new influx of players and income hopefully may lead to improve the game or it's popularity. Probably toxicity would increase though.
---
But at this point after the laggy raids and delayed Wastelanders I wouldn't even care. If they are gonna add stuff like Fallout First just make the game free.
---
For 5 bucks I want a life time of free support!!
---
I think the most you can hope for is "Can we get...the Wastelanders DLC" 
---
Start small.
---
Much like Activision with Destiny, Bethesda has lost a consumer in its handling of Fallout76.  I will not pay a dime to any company current or in the future that fails to deliver a complete game on release date and who rely on loot box and pay to play schemes.
---
How about option 3 "Would subscribe if it was half the price"
---
Sadly not

Automatic upvote for a fellow Cody

Voted......will you post the results up top as an edit, or as a reply?

Don't trust a single player company to make a competitive multiplayer game.

I watched a juice head video yesterday that was saying that there are a lot of 1st subs. He went into how most of the negative feedback on Reddit was coming from non players who don‚Äôt like it and how most 76 players didn‚Äôt seem to want to wade into the drama and were just ignoring the hype.
---
voted.
---
3 star legendaries should drop 3 star gear
---
 Nothings perfect. The game is fine, runs really well on my machine, I built to play it. As I play Fallout games my way, and have through all the 3D Fallout games, I have little problem with anything the game does.
---
 Been playing since the beta. I have over 800 hours in a few characters, what would you like to know?
---
I mean, that would be cool, but hear me out. 
---
If 1sters are the only ones with the riot gear, they should wear that, and everyone without fist wear the gladiator armor/cop shades/bandana. Just saying.
---
I've played the event a few times on ps4. I've crashed a few times to the blue screen, had the game freeze up a few times so I had to close out the game and start it back up, and I died once and couldn't respawn my character. I would be stuck on a screen that says to press X to respawn, but nothing would happen no matter what buttons I pressed. Had to close out the game. I have gotten a few nice rewards from the event. Got a cool orange suit with Jack-o-lantern faces on it today.
---
So we‚Äôre you an active 76 player before the 1st sub controversy?
---
option 5  "Not really against subbing, but not interested in the stuff they have on offer now - if they sweeten the deal then maybe" =)  I reckon that's me
---
Idk why you are getting downvoted, i totally agree with you
---
I normally consider voting a heresy, but today I can honestly say I voted for something that matters to me ü§™
---
I agree with you. You are "perennial" subscriber so to say, although I'm wondering if anyone will stay subscribed for more than one month really. We are just in the "oh it's new!" phase and that will fade out.
---
Lol. I prolly would get it for just the atom but free items sound fun.
---
&gt; there has be a decline in tec stock for a while which is why it looks bad. 
---
It's a private company, not quoted on any exchange, you are a lying troll.
---
Also don't understand why I'm being downvoted?? My game that I pre-ordered does not work anymore, one year after release. I turn to this subreddit for help and get nothing. I wish I was in Australia...
---
Survey answered, it would be nice to see current results

Of course it isn‚Äôt mandatory. I just thought it would be cool to see an Appalachia-wide American Civil War re-enactment.
---
Yh they just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Plus sometimes the health bar goes back up cause the explosive shots register and then don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just a Mess but I‚Äôm 140 levels in so can‚Äôt rly change it now
---
There is one on the south end of White Springs if I'm not mistaken, there are some of the security bots nearby that'll add some protection. Another one right next to the Top of the World train station too and I've never spotted enemies attacking CAMPs there.
---
There is another near National Radio Astronomy Research Center, but it has scorched there and they'll take pop shots at your CAMP (conveniently out of range of turrets).
---
I'm going to @ them on Twitter and post the results to the Reddit if you want to stay tuned! Lmao thanks for the suggestion
---
Thank you :)
---
Better way to phrase is
---
1) yes
---
2) yes, but I only subscribed for1 month then canceled immediately
---
3) no
---
The -real- telling thing will be how many people are still Fallout 1st subs after that initial month.
---
Is there a target audience for Reddit when it's a forum? I don't think Reddit is targeting a certain age group, however some subs do, Fallout 76 in fairness has a very even spread, but in comparison to other games, it has a large older audience. Take Fortnite, I'd say that has quite a young average. The only reason I say this, is that I've played Fallout 76 since BETA, pretty much on a daily basis, and I've encountered about 50/50 old/young ratio.
---
Right across the highway from top of the world train station has a junk pile. It‚Äôs centrally located and right next to train station. 
---
Edited to add that it‚Äôs near water as well.
---
Think you got it backwards there bud... think the ‚Äú1st‚Äù should be the yanks since they are the ones (paying) winning and the very few hunters with a loud reddit presence should be the confederated.
---
Just saying it‚Äôs more accurate ü§£ü§£
---
And it comes with 500 atoms
---
Like I said, it could be visa-versa.
---
There‚Äôs one just outside the walls. On the side of the train station. Follow the road south and you‚Äôll find some cars turned into a tiny campsite right next to the wall. It should be there(ish)
---
Both as long you don‚Äôt get good cap offers
---
Voted this is great thank you
---
What is the name of this yter so I can contact them?
---
Yup!
---
On the PS4 trophies (i.e. PlayStation's achievements) are always shown as a sub-category of the game, even if they're added with a minor/free update. The base game's list is never expanded.
---
"Trust me, I'm a dishonest man. You can always trust a dishonest man to be dishonest. Honestly, it's the honest ones you've got to watch out for, because you can never tell when they're going to do something incredibly stupid."
---
I wouldn't doubt it my friend. I wish I lived in Australia right about now...
---
Well there are plenty of black powder weapons around so it would work. Could use some Broadsiders on each side as artillery and we can get a Grade A reenactment going on!
---
Voted. :Nod:
---
When it shipped, about half of my friendlist, though that's mainly people I've traded with and who arent't best representive of general playerbase, looked like they had 1st.
---
The problem with this survey is that it doesn't ask you if you even own the game, hence leaving it to be brigaded or have the final results skewed. As there are a lot of people in this sub who are only here for the drama.
---
They  should just make a ‚Äúpick a faction vs faction side server‚Äù. That would def make it interesting for sure and fun imho
---
This is what I thought, thank you for answering my simple question. I wonder what triggered people to downvote me for it?
---
I haven‚Äôt yet see cheaters. It is a PC problem or on console too?
---
No i did not
---
The joke is already stale
---
"I do not want to discuss the morality of fallout first, I do not support it in any way, and that is that." Then goes on to say maybe I'll get it for a month lol. üòÇü§£üòÇüòâ

We know who the "the camp you can 'probably' trust" billboard is for
---
Didn't say that now did I? To my knowledge they have yet to pull a Blizzard tho.
---
The more I read about everything the more I'm let down. I just wish that with every update to the shop they would add new items and things around the world for us to find. Just new content to go with all the things we can buy
---
I use two shot handmade for up close damage and an AAE for distance. How much bonus damage does the furious effect add compared to two shot?
---
answered
---
PC - voted no and have no plans to ever subscribe
---
I am saying that I do not support Bethesda‚Äôs business practices or this service. I would essentially be purchasing the cosmetics.
---
We take the vote as it is. A section of Fallout 76 player who are on this sub. It's not supposed to be an all encompassing vote, it does however cover one section of the Fallout 76 user group, however big or small, and in that it gives an indication of the amount of subscribers who are "first" subscribers, from that we can make an educated guess vote of the entirety of the Fallout 76 community.
---
Both Vault 96 and 63 were planned to host raids, as far as I know, and 96 was supposed to be released this year sometime after 94. I guess it was delayed and might not come until Wastelanders, which is the main focus right now.
---
Venting about what? I‚Äôm literally joking saying I wish I didn‚Äôt have kids lol
---
Or I might if been mistaken. But thanks for calling me a lying troll.
---
Its true however Zenimax has investors so take that how you will
---
If you have chemist craft diluted stims which gives you 4 or 200 % heal
---
I'm on both subs. In fairness, I'd say most filthy casuals are here too.
---
I only charge 60 caps for a full set
---
It‚Äôs not really surprising, because everyone wants legendary stuff.
---
I‚Äôm still looking for a legendary staff.
---
There should have been 3 questions.
---
1) (Baseline) Do you own and Currently play the game Fallout: 76
---
Y/N (if No=End of questionnaire)
---
2) Are you or have you subscribed to Fallout 1st?
---
Y/N
---
3) Do you intend on continuing your Fallout 1st Membership?
---
This questionnaire is open to everyone, regardless of whether they own the game or not.
---
Your results aren't going to be truly indicative of the reddit using playerbase because of this.
---
Many people subscribe to this subreddit for the ongoing drama.
---
Moira Brown does not approve
---
Oh damn.  I‚Äôll definitely grab one for a mule account.
---
I didn't even join Reddit until Fallout 4 was announced, even though I had been using it for years prior, so it is also true that there are members of the community who see what is posted on Reddit and may or may not be influenced by the opinions expressed, but have never made a comment or even an account.
---
I've been wondering the same thing. In my case, i will play until my subscription is over then cancel it and move to other games. Haven't touched outer worlds and RDR2 is coming this month.
---
Have to account for the amount of people who are going to answer that haven't bought the game, that are going to use something like a VPN to answer multiple times, or that will send it to their friends to get more no answers.
---
The community has been so toxic lately and while I think this is a wonderful idea the execution could probably use some added safeguards in order to not have the people who stay on this reddit just to troll skew the data in a major way.
---
Also I voted
---
I don't think any toxicity that involve death threats and the  level of poor discussion that even  get to the level of inbox messages, ad hominem and in-game harassment is not justifiable at all. The fact that you got 11 upvotes is astonishing to me.
---
I think they plan to milk Fallout 1st as long as they can and shut it down whenever that revenue stream dries up.  I doubt they are going to put much effort into fixing cheats and exploits. Nuclear Winter will probably still happen but probably not much after that.
---
yes
---
Server hopping for ticks at the Moonshiner's Shack, use Butcher's Bounty for more blood.  Put on Chemist and Super Duper and craft blood packs and then stimpaks at the chemistry workbench.  I usually have about 100 stims after 45 minutes of server hopping.
---
OP, you should not only ask if you are a subscriber to Fallout 1st, but if you own the game as well, and if you played in the last month. There are plenty of users here who are inactive, or came from r/fallout but don't own the game.
---
You just need to have .0001% points in intellect to understand that it's never going to be a perfect survey for any topic, something everyone understands.

I got a b/ss/90 meat hook from AWOL a couple weeks ago. I assumed that was my luck for the remainder of the year, but I got a uny/ap/sneak metal arm yesterday off some random super mutant near the radio array.

I'm in the double digits for crashes in this event, so I understand this. If I don't go to the corner, stare at the ground and sit still, over 3/4 of the time it crashes and takes too long to get the game booted back up, so I miss all rewards. Out of the 20 times I've tried, I've only been able to sucessfully complete 5 without crashing to Xbox homescreen.

You've made it to /all! That's pretty cool, but people who don't play the game at all like myself (and maybe people who just don't agree Bethesda's decisions [also like me]) may skew your numbers by voting "No" en masse. It's something to definitely be on the lookout for in the final tally.

For people like me in these ways, I would say please exercise restraint out of respect for the scientific process.

Don't answer here but maybe everyone say they voted after? More comments equals more engagement. I voted!

That‚Äôs the beast of cloud services, these are virtual servers running on somebody else‚Äôs cloud and B is getting the bill.  If they had a higher tier that would cover their costs fully for that server instance per month just for you then sure I could see this being viable.  
---
At work we have to balance the same thing with virtual desktops, gotta kick people off every so often otherwise they will be online forever incurring charges that the Dept gets the bill for kinda thing.

But I agree would be hella nice!

On a ***non-optimized build***
---
You stated you couldn‚Äôt beat any bosses. I pointed out that even with a build that could be more combat focused, I can solo 98% of the bosses in the game. 
---
And with my pure combat PVE build, I can also solo SBQ easily. Sheepsquatch is only challenging because of the event conditions. 
---
And even that can be soloed: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t_dUiXh9XYI
---
So, yes, everything can be soloed. But not unless you have the right combination of gear/perks/ability/knowledge. 
---
*Or did you think it meant you could run through the game with a low level non-legendary pipe pistol and scrub gear &amp; skills?*
---
You're an angry leprechaun.

Edit: wait are you that Irish guy?

Edit: ok wrong guy. Yeah lifes pretty good lol. Tonight  I'm grilling steaks drinking some beer anddddd you guessed it, playing 76. Sorry you felt compelled to come type that.

Have you tried pressing q?

I don't think so. I've got it on PC &amp; PS4, no problems there. You can see which accounts are linked on the BGS website, they're added once you sign in on the respective platform(s).

No, Billy, you aren't bethesda's mommy. In fact, you're their target audience! A stupid little sheep who will shill out money and blindly defend Bethesda - even against logical criticisms.
---
Aren't you a good boy, Billy. Now run along, and dont forget to pay $60 for the upcoming fallout 76 expansion; where we treat you with 2 new skins, 1 brand new npc, and 500 caps to top it off. Straight from the butthole of Todd himself to you, the payer.
---
Yup, it‚Äôs a big nope on most plants.  If it‚Äôs not in the menu now, you can‚Äôt plant it....ever.
---
Same thing if Im low on caps, just afk vending. Change server about every 2-3h
---
Abandoned dump.  Do it over and over and over and over and you will see.  30 min 20 stimpaks then break them down using chemist and superduper.

It‚Äôs likely that to avoid further issue with the blatant violation of Australian consumer law, they‚Äôd probably still do refunds.

Hahahahaha! This made me laugh for real.
---
I hate to say it, as I strongly disagree with this subscription service. Ultimately the world is a much bigger place then the internet, let alone reddit. I think at this point it's already been established that the internet does not like the subscription. However people still play the game. People still get the Subscription, and those same people probably never come to this sub reddit. I would take this survey lightly.
---
I subscribed to first myself, so I'm not trying to give you shit over it, but if you bought it wouldn't that be "essentially" supporting Bethesda's business practices and the first services?
---
Personally for all weapons, I stick to 2* unless there‚Äôs a sale. The tertiary effect usually isn‚Äôt worth double the scrip to me. 
---
For armor, 3* each time.  Those tertiary effects (5 available at a time) are worth it to me.
---
Only if you've bought the game recently. If you didn't attempt to get one ages ago, they can refuse
---
I guess so, yeah. I‚Äôm kinda in between a rock and a hard place. Support? Or desire those sweet sweet cosmetics?
---
I think that to really support it, I would get the year subscription. Maybe I am just being hypocritical. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to justify an endless desire to look badass while rebuilding America? :-)
---
One of the farms up north has about six plants. That‚Äôs where I go when it‚Äôs time to make more relish.

You can plant gourds though.
---
Last time I did the math the only two materials that took up less space bulked were lead and aluminum iirc.  Bulked Acid actually was heavier.  Maybe they fixed that?

One time $60 then. I don't need the philosophical lecture on how nothing is free mang
---
It's not really a vote its yes or no.... I clicked a thing...done

Up north by wavy willards and the space station doesnt get that much activity, rarely gets attacked by anything except radstag so plenty of good meat too

Up north by the space station and by kiddie corners cabins

A gauss minigun sounds lethal, but will it have a charging mechanic to go along with the already tedious spin-up?
---
I‚Äôm kinda excited about a gauss pistol.
---
Really, any new weapon will be welcome.
---
Been saying it from day one. How TF are you gonna put country roads in the game and it not be by John Denver?
---
It should be fine. Don't expect your character to be transferred since they use different servers for each platforms.

Placing your camp where ever a yao guai spawns is not a good idea. So place your camp where ever a yao guai never spawns.

A two shot mini gun is powerful? Regardless of any other perk it could possibly come with an extra 25% on top of any perks being ran makes it strong. Sounds like you‚Äôre just trying to be stuck up. PvP I have no idea but PvE that kinda thing shreds
---
Just east of Charlie Site up on the cliffs is a nice bit of flat, and where I have mine just west of The Top Of The World, a quarter/third way down the cliff is another flat space picnic area where radstag and possums spawn for good food, you rarely EVER get attacked and if you do it‚Äôs often times a glowing radstag or mole rats, real easy to manage
---
From what was data mined monthly subscribers would have their subscription items swapped per month not sure if this is in affect however yearly subscribers we keep everything month-to-month regardless of cancelling subscription or not.
---
Fuck no.
---
I subscribed to the first Fallout.
---
No items are ever lost, cancellation or whatever. Monthly subscribers don‚Äôt lose anything, it would just be added. What I am wondering is more about what is available for new subscribers.
---
I did the survey.
---
Wait, you said what was datamined? Could you elaborate?

Dude I got the pant suit maybe twice, I have to look, I only got one pirate costume!! I really needed one more. I guess I‚Äôll have to buy if it doesn‚Äôt drop today, but I‚Äôve don‚Äôt like over 50 of these.
---
That's a vote from me, dawg

Yeah, I didn't expect it to either. I keep trying to login and it keeps referring me to the find account section of bethesda.net

Never said that, no need to " sort " out anything...

Lol sure will

Also south of HZ-21 workshop there's a farm that grows cranberries and various other plants for people that are located on south part of the map.
---
I didn't think so,  but so many people were talking about it I figured I'd post something
---
Sure. They'll make you host your own private world like in minecract. And make you pay for the privilege to host Fallout 76 on your own hardware.
---
Dude are you a time traveler from the old west or what? Its 27 cents a day. Stop being so ignorant it's cringeworthy. You arent a white knight leading a rebellion againest some nameless evil. You are just another turd on the turd bandwagon. Let people be in peace. Stop trying to force your opinions on others.
---
&gt;I am seeing more reports that Bethesda believes that they are seeing a promising number of subscribers
---
I believe that this is in fact true.   Full disclosure: I am not a subscriber and I threw a fit about it when it first rolled out. So me calling it a "success" is not a statement of support. It is a statement of fact based on what I am seeing in the game. Seeing a lot of ranger outfits, [sex tents](https://falloutfirst.com/)  on a daily basis in the game world and in fairly large number.
---
I had a camp up there by a junk resource site for a good long while. Rarely attacked and it was real close to TONS of radstags for the meat.
---
funny I don't recall anyone asking for your opinion either
---
I voted. Good idea, OP.
---
Apparently well-known data miner was able to determine that apparently monthly subscribers we get different cosmetics per month with a subscription to the fallout first program they found information that suggested that monthly subscribers would lose the bonus items per month but gain new ones with the next month subscription, it is unclear weather this is currently in effect or not but he did confirm that the yearly subscribers would get to keep all bonus items for the 12-month subscription as they had paid a lot more money than the monthly subscribers, had read in an article 2-days ago while I was off work also sure there was a few YouTubers who reported about the leaks, the only problem is nobody knows if Bethesda are gonna use this system or will everybody retain the bonus items I myself I'm a yearly subscriber but we won't find out until next month.
---
I‚Äôm guessing the song‚Äôs rights were pretty expensive.
---
I‚Äôm doing my part! I voted!
---
Thanks. I'll try and build a camp there.
---
Bethesda said that all cosmetics would be kept.
---
This is certainly strange. There is a hole in that logic, though. Yearly subscribers are technically paying ‚Äúless‚Äù money than monthly, over the course of a year.
---
Took it
---
Oh, I‚Äôll have to check that out, seem to have about 500 DR at the moment
---
Best way to hunt is to pacify them all then throw blue smoke at the herd and watch em get bombed, turns them into a bloody eyeball strewn paste, yum!
---
Yes, they *can* refuse. But until we see someone make the attempt and get an answer one way or another, that‚Äôs up in the air. 
---
Someone could cite the fact that they were aware of Bethesda‚Äôs refusal and therefore didn‚Äôt make an attempt, which might be sufficient. I don‚Äôt know the exact particulars of how or if that would fall under Australian law, but I wouldn‚Äôt dissuade someone from making said attempt.
---
I have done the event a dozen or so times and haven't crashed once.
---
Thanks for your contribution. Even if it is, well, pathetic.
---
yes, but once you pay, they gon' milk it 
---
that was my point 
---
i bought 1 month to see how it is and it is definitely pay2win
---
I'm going to make a guess that 20-25% of people that respond are Fallout 1st subscribers.
---
Obviously it's not Fallout 76 :3
---
It's more like a less buggy game with more benefits.
---
Fo76map.com has an interactive map that will show you all the resources (among other things) I use it to find resource piles near areas adventuring in all the time.
---
So have you actually learnt them and can make in your own camp? Or did you just sell an empty pumpkin rack plan? I‚Äôve herd so many conflicting reports at this point.. I need solid proofüò≠
---
Would love local hosted servers but Bethesda will never do it. Seems like they care about money and control. They won't be able to sell us mods for our private servers if they allow local hosting.
---
Well when you're selling your game for 15~20$ you would be happy with any amount of subscribers
---
This is what I have herd but I have also herd other conflicting reports and people that say they have it.. there‚Äôs gotta be proof out there?üò≠
---
It's all just a simulation, the war never happened.
---
I think 80% is probably generous but like you said below we can never really know the numbers so I'll stop being pedantic with them haha 
---
Regardless though, all I'm trying to say is that while Reddit might be the minority that doesn't mean it's not representative of the general community. There are plenty of people piling on Bethesda in here which may influence some people but there's also plenty here that do the complete opposite and influence them the other way.
---
It's not like off of this website everybody formulates their opinions un a bubble. The players that aren't on the forums still have their feelings coloured by all sorts of external sources, the same sources that spark off love or hate here - memes, reviews, YouTube videos, interviews etc.

If reddit had image embedding, I'd put one of those "I Voted!" pins here.

Less bugs and less microtransactions
---
May I ask what program you use please?
---
You're right but it's no surprise that Bethesda didn't put much thought or effort into the launch of the private worlds.
---
Hopefully you'll get this in like 2-3 patches from now. Seems like the first added feature coming is making private worlds actually private. smh.

Pink bats? Extremely.

Okay thanks.

Any program will probably work, protection is awful from bethesdas side.
---
I need the persistent servers to happen before I spend money on this.  I want to set up power and defenses for most of the workshops and I want them to still be producing when I log out and log back in.  I mainly want private servers to harvest resources without having to build new generators every single time or  the risk of being griefed. It's  kind of useless to me without that feature.
---
Voted. I haven't played in many many months and really dont see myself ever coming back to it. Sad. I enjoyed a lot.of the game but bugs upon bugs and just greedy atom shop turned me off.

Any questions?!

Worse still, some only have a single monetisation scheme. Fallout 76 now has 3.

People who haven't had baby shit under their finger nails haven't adjusted yet.

---
Plasma cores, usually.   Lootable, or sometimes in green ammo cans
---
IIRC, you can craft them at a fairly early/low level.
---
I've had this discussion today already on this subreddit, and the people claiming they knew the plan couldn't provide any evidence.
---
And I'm sure that if they did suddenly start dropping, we'd have heard about it by now
---
We need video evidence of someone opening their workshop mode, scrolling to the empty rack, and building it, no cuts
---
Fuck no, people still play that dumpster fire? That game made me rethink my entire relationship with Bethesda. 
---
We were already on the rocks due to Skyrim being drug out for years because "memes", FO4 literally had 4 story endings and nothing compelling about it (although I'll admit to liking the gunplay), ESO although not made by Bethesda was a horrific abomination. 
---
Oh and Outer Worlds, it kicks ass. Suck it Bethesda I may be done with you.
---
There is a very basic file check, i can't play NW as i've got QoL mods installed and i'm fucked if i'm turning them off to play battle royale.
---
Nobody is keeping you here, you know.
---
I am on PS4 if you do let me know! I will pay you for them happily üòä
---
I am not, but can totally see myself getting it at least once for the atoms and cosmetics.
---
That's a very good question. Now if they'd actually talk to us, we might know.
---
Yes I am
---
lol not everyone here even plays the game.
---
Your data will be screwed from the get.
---
I‚Äôd settle for a picture of it built in someone‚Äôs camp at his point, I just don‚Äôt understand why people would claim they have something if they don‚Äôt and not prove it.. if I had the plan I would‚Äôve 200% posted it to my Twitter by now!
---
That's right - I see the most dumb ass posts score the highest by far.
---
The outer worlds?
---
This post is pointless there is no rift between players and who cares anyway?
---
I'm just passing by..
---
&lt;Unsubstantiated reply&gt;
---
People enjoy trolling unfortunately, its that simple.
---
A picture can be faked rather easily by removing the red outline on the item, and cropping the screen.
---
Video proof of it being built would 100% settle the debate
---
I paid 60 bucks for mine - where is the f2p here?
---
A second question might be useful as well.  
---
If you subscribed, will you continue the subscription beyond 1 month?
---
500 caps is way too low, on the market subreddit it‚Äôs worth a lot of caps and trades. I‚Äôd suggest posting it on there!
---
nostalgia you say..
---
fallout 3
---
Apparently a few people if you haven't noticed , now stop responding and go about your day. I'm sure you have better things to do right??
---
Thanks for your thoughts, nobody cares,  goodbye now :)
---
seriously dude lol
---
Bug Parts will be used for acid in crafting before it uses any bulk acids. Careful when smelting or making gunpowder.
---
There are at least 500 residents, which is the number found for Vault 76 in one of the terminals in  the Citadel in Fallout 3.
---
That would be amazing. If only the counter didn't stop at 199 no matter what you do, 1 shy as per 50% of the challenges that never mark completed.
---
Hummm... that might be it
---
Not all game systems should be explained as a part of the lore.
---
Yeah I was suspisious of that. There was also someone else show video of it working as proof. They showed their perks too, which was odd, as I thought if it occured them to show their perks, how exactly did it not occur to them to show what torso piece they were wearing too.
---
Oh I dig the old thread, you also noticed it too.
---
And that Excavator PA extra light thing lol.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
Morgantown airport hangars - most have at least one first aid kit..
---
Alos get a bunch by doing the WS circuit.  Most of the ghouls drop either. To pack, radx, or radaway.  dont forget to check the medicine cabinet in the bathrooms.
---
Physical.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try!
---
I see and get this glitch where i can't stim people sometime, a lot during the mischief mayhem event. You sure it wasn't that?
---
Portal?
---
Ah so, you're here for no reason.
---
Cool. Now go role play that someone cares somewhere else
---
Good looking out. Got you hook line and sinker.
---
Maybe it was.  But my bag dropped because the event over and someone took it.  Had I died during it, no bigs.   Reload and keep pushing that progress bar.
---
Why did it ask all kinda of political questions after?
---
!remind me 20 hours
---
Adamantium skeleton only provides immunity to cripples so no matter what happens you will never be crippled but your still open to limb damage just not cripples so I hope this helps it‚Äôs tricky
---
Down but wish I could see how it was going
---
When they say "limb damage" it's about your limbs' "health". When you take too much damage in your limbs, you got a debuff. With adamantium skeleton you no longer get the debuff. It's usefull for melee tanks if you don't want to loose mobility.
---
I have my CAMP on the lake by Silo Alpha and the Yao Guai, even glowing and lv76, is not a problem.
---
And why shouldn't people build on top of Seneca Rocks? Genuinely curious.
---
I voted xD
---
I've survived longer in solo because I don't have anyone but myself to give away my position when I want to hide in a bush.
---
Also fireproof will help you more to deal with explosion, like Scorchbeast soundwave attack
---
Voted. Curious to see what the results are going to be.
---
Isn't the version of Ring of Fire in the game a cover too?
---
I voted for you my brother
---
I guess so, there's more people like me complaining about the game. So expect more drifters in this sub-reddit. But just saying, are you fully satisfied with this game? Are you fully loyal to your master, Todd Howard?
---
One example before I stopped watching him was the 900 hr guy who claimed he was banned for no reason. Within the same Reddit post and not that long after the main post was made, people started noting massive irregularities and it turned out that it was nigh on impossible that the 900 hrs guy was telling the truth.
---
Yongyea didn't do the bare minimum effort in research to find this out and didn't set the record straight when it was pointed out to him.
---
Yongyea is a low effort muckraking Youtuber who farms top posts for controversy. He's a terrible source of news because he's so poorly informed himself.
---
That's just one example. If you watched his content long enough you will see it time and time again. Best to delete him from your YT recommendations and move on.
---
I was 1 hit away from ending the mischief sentinel and reap the rewards when my 2 yo casually hit the Xbox button powering off my experience and robbing me of my precious rewards.  Little brat is learning early!
---
Another voice, admitting defeat at the hands of ghouls, and definitely the king's. I am also in unyeilding, and suddenly dying way more often. I will also try the unequip thing.
---
Doing that doesn't reduce lag since the car's respawn as soon as the event starts.
---
That shitty. Happens a lot to me. I find it funny when someone take crappy load they'll never need and I only picked up because I'm a loot whore xD
---
Absolutely free private servers that you can mod and change the settings on to your hearts content..
---
Ark riddled by bugs? On a 76 thread no less. The bugs you find playing through from the start of Ark to the final boss on the final map are little different than the ones you'd find in 76 currently.
---
Am I not allowed to like it or something without being called a shill? Cause it's seeming like that more and more each day
---
So downvote me because I have it? Whatever man. Lmao.
---
Knowing these things happen and are possible in Nuclear Winter, I can't understand why people would play Nuclear Winter. I am not being sarcastic, I am not trying to pick a fight. It's like... let the stupid mode die. Only cheaters will keep playing to see who cheats faster or harder.
---
It's like being the little cousin and being given a disconnected NES controller.
---
Data miners honestly don't know half of what they dig up anyway. Bethesda most likely added it in last minute because I started getting it 2 days later when the event first started happening.
---
Splatface 2?
---
You're right but we have far more pressing issues to resolve in this game that just outfit clipping.
---
It reminds me of the ways in which could unlock Kano and Sonya while playing Mortal Kombat 2. 
---
Like, flawless victories, no suing this button, only Babalities... oh, those urban myths... gotta love them.
---
There's a thing called protests. This is being implied toward Bethesda's bizzare actions. So of course you're being called a "shill" or whatever because more fans are turning against this game.
---
Zombies Ate my Neighbors? If that's so, you made me take a lot of nostalgia pills, nice work with the outfit and your character tho.
---
I've done it close to 50 times and I've never crashed once either.
---
I still had to buy the firefighter outfit from the whitespring vendor bots because apparently I can only get awarded the grim reaper cutout and not any good outfit. I have close to 15 grim reapers cutout and still no pirate suit or Whitespring jumpsuit...
---
Well, that's cheap.
---
Unless you are a sub you shouldn‚Äôt even be playing this game folks.
---
Fallout 76
---
Right? You can enjoy consuming something while also making valid criticism of it...
---
I found two semi-exotic baseball bats by using US Requisition holotapes. Got the spiked yellow fluorescent , the chained pink one, both level 5 (because you dont use those holotapes after that, you know). Scrapped them both. Character was an overweight medicine woman, good with a knife. So, 2h melee was shit.
---
no - I already gave them enough money for this broken mess.
---
We have a winner. Send me the request as soon as you can.
---
You might also note that the price includes 6 official maps, 3 free DLC maps, and access to tons of mod maps, while Fallout 76 currently has 1.. there's vastly more gameplay in Ark.
---
Yeah well, just cause someone isn't "protesting", doesn't make them a shitty person that's shilling for Bethesda.
---
Also the way I said protesting is cause I see a lot of people that are supposedly protesting, just insulting people instead
---
As an edit.
---
Yo vote.
---
Voted -- but keep in mind this subreddit is not a good representation of people still playing/enjoying the game anymore.
---
This. 
---
Also, in fallout 4 the player was a synth.
---
Theres some interesting terminals in the enclave bunker, at least one person had some suspicions.
---
Voted üòä
---
Can't remember the last time i was rolled by someone. I just don't like cowards that only attack peeps when they're not even aware they're being attacked. You sound like you have the character of a rapist. Lol.
---
Either way, this is a revelational ending for Fallout 76. I guess you can stay on the sinking boat for about 4 more months.
---
The trapper one looks like IT SHOULD look like that. I love it on some outfits. Scavenger, ragstad outfit, tattered rags also. 
---
So, I can't support you on this one, sorry. Just wear a combat armor chest.
---
Done.  Adult age 40-45, and even though you said not to answer, no I‚Äôm not a 1st member.
---
Voted. Thanks for posting this
---
Eh, one that has infinite space to place his scrap shouldn't care so much about a little bit of components. People have to sacrifice a good chunk of their only 800 lbs of stash space and keep evaluating what they can take and what they can throw away, while you can keep looting stuff forever and not care about the consequences so honestly you are overreacting.
---
I voted but I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll really be able to get a representative sampling here. People who have the service are going to be more inclined to vote / view the post than people who don‚Äôt subscribe / play regularly anymore
---
Healing a Factor mutation will make you stockpile stimpacks
---
Don't worry though, your developers are working hard like Anthem's devs.
---
Don't think it's going anywhere for a bit. The in game community is a bit different to the Reddit one
---
:( I preordered for full price. Don‚Äôt regret it but it still hurts to see it going for so cheap.
---
Cyberpunk 2077 will be surprising one. Hey, it's all about dignity! Ain't that right?
---
You are right. That's it. My commando needs to be careful in order not to trigger the bug. And my shotgunner is transitioning into a heavy gunner because I need like ten shells to the head to kill a lvl 35 ghoul when my pipboy says I should be able to cause 265 plus the Instigating effect and the perforating mods.
---
Shotguns are only good for crippling until they fix it. And this FEELS SOOOO BETAAA....
---
During public events, no. But once she‚Äôs dead and the event is over...
---
"Negatory."
---
"Does that mean maybe?"
---
"No."
---
No death bags during events anymore
---
I've sold 2 sets yesterday and today but because I live near the event area mischief night you'll need to be very quick, I already have a modded out alien blaster, the Nuka cola armour paints and the imposter sheepquatch outfit, so just 60 caps will suffice.
---
I've got one set left in stock because I'm keeping one for myself. Although I have another bidder offering a heavily modded 2 shot explosive Gauss rifle and a dragon, also she's a personal friend
---
You're either mistaken or you're lying. Stop spreading misinformation, please. It's not funny.
---
Yah ill be never understand why they use reddit posts in there vids aside from reddit posts ive never seen too much thats technically wrong barring opinions btw i seen people say there wrong all the time ur the first to actually answer my question
---
Voted. We should more poll line that. Maybe it would show Beth what the community really wants
---
During public events you no longer drop a death bag.
---
Very handy üëçüèª
---
You dont during events anymore, I dont remember what patch but it certainly was recently.
---
Funny thing. It may be a game a lot want to come out, but not everyone is excited for it.
---

---
Here! Here! When I was a boy, we used to spend quarters and get what we paid for!
---
The EU and AUS regions are about 21 euros or less on keysites. US has always been much more for some reason. But when Fallout 1st came, the US version got removed from some of them.
---
How could you be mistaken.  You claimed, with no caveats: "there has be a decline in tec stock for a while".
---
How could you possibly make that "mistake"?  Where did you see a reference to Bethesda's "stock"?
---
Insulting?  Fuck I barely pay attention to replies to the shit I post.  
---
I view Bethesda as a dumpster fire, the last good game they released was skyrim.  Everything after is in all honesty just utter trash compared to what came before it.  Fallout 4? never cared for it, only bought it for the person I was with at the time.  ESO, played it for a day or two, then went back to other games; because it's nothing compared to the old days of WoW.  
---
I don't agree with the targeting of those who do buy first; Though the only way to even fix shit is for people to actually work together and fight against Bethesda, but none of them know how to actually work together, to fall under one banner; and fight against the companies screwing them all over.  It's oh well though, while everyone wastes their money on games made by companies that stopped caring about the players 5 years ago, I'll stick to the decent games made by Indie Devs.
---
People also said things like "the more people there are during Scorched Earth, the stronger the SBQ is" or "if you nuke the Crashed space station three times at once an alien will spawn and do a little dance for you"  
---
I can assure you the plans are unobtainable, don't believe anyone who says otherwise.
---
It's a next generational thing with better graphics and there's more content involved. Remember when Todd said Fallout 76 was going to have "4 times the details" and some other bullshit?
---
Much easier to just run the wire through a doorway and then change the doorway to a regular wall.
---
Apparently I did not get the rack but I have seen him with the empty rack so it does exist. It may have JUST been added.
---
&gt;I can't support you on this one, sorry. Just wear a combat armor chest.
---
Sure, do you have a unyielding-weapons weight combat armor chest for sale?  :)  
---
With Patch 13 it the clipping started so it is NOT clip like it does.
---
16, which was obviously bull, but still. Not everything is about graphics. And not everything is interesting to everyone. Know it's only interesting to some like a friend of mine cause wow, Keanu Reeves is in it.
---
&gt; it is only a 1* so not that important I suppose
---
That's also part of the problem.  Some players try to justify melting it in a second with sustained gatling plasma fire with "It's just a one star.  People just want the rewards" and "It doesn't even matter to me" even though they were the only one that got a legendary out of it.
---
Other people like to round out their scrip limit with low-level legendaries too.
---
This needs a few more questions:
---
‚ÄúIf you answered ‚Äòyes‚Äô, did you buy a year or a month of subscription‚Äù
---
And
---
‚ÄúIf you purchased one month of the subscription, do you plan on continuing payments?‚Äù
---
I suspect that the subscription rates are high, but that the drop-out rate after a month will be high as well due to game content not holding player‚Äôs attention for long enough.
---
A revolver has 204, and any farther than that is unnecessary unless you are trying to kill Marcy Long while she walks around Sanctuary.
---
I have actually seen more legit drops lately based on level. 
---
The weapons are mostly shit, but hey a 3 star pool cue still counts for 40.
---
If your 5 cap items weren't taxed, I'd assume it rounds up
---
I think I've been getting more legendaries than usual. I've also noticed a lot of 3 stars give 1 stars, but I think it seems just highlighted by the large amont of 3 star enemies. I would think the amount of 3 stars is about normal.
---
It's all crap anyway so as long as you have enough legendaries to recycle, I don't think it matters much.
---
I've been also thinking one shotting the 3 stars gives always 1 star. Except then the one comes up and it gives 2/3 stars. It just feels so.
---
https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241?lang=en
---
&gt; No. Only cosmetic.
---
Really hard to misquote 3 words.
---
Tell them that...
---
I mean, some players could do with not acting like flaming douchesticks during limited-time public events.
---
Bloodied is pretty much always best in PVE if you are willing to commit to the low HP lifestyle.
---
I played several hours Saturday and didn‚Äôt crash once.  Today?  It froze or crashed on me like 5 times in about 3 hours of play.
---
Right in the goddamn middle of taking down an SBQ.  Fuck!!
---
Pretty sure it's only taxed every 10c. It's more of a flat rate. You can say sell something for 29c, basically getting your 30c but only being taxed 2c versus the 3c for going up that one cap.
---
Pretty sure. If I'm wrong well somebody else will correct me.
---
Poor soul... 
---
Well, you're the only one playing unsatisfactory games here bud. Keep Fallout 76 churning, hope you will make some life-changing events there. I'll wait on next-generational content with no bullshit.
---
I get so many of those from Scorchbeast guano piles.
---
Do what I do and instigate the PvP.
---
Are they selling the trash ones or trying to?
---
Guessing you're assuming all I play is this game. Have been playing Outer World's, but also mixing that in with some Fire Emblem when at work.
---
Outer World's can't be a replacement though. Too short
---
Or maybe they are doing it to help people out?   I run ahead at the end to take out the 2-3 sentry bots and assaultrons lurking.
---
You obviously haven‚Äôt done Encryptid.  The worst.
---
They do ftp from time to time. I think they did when nuclear winter first came out
---
You're a man of good taste üçµ
---
That‚Äôs tuff
---
I think that‚Äôs more that players just don‚Äôt get that someone has to take the pylons. Or no one wants to waste stimpaks.
---
That was before those original residents had children. The vault was packed after the war.
---
Bam, done. Commenting to do my part with helping you get even more exposure
---
I voted. There's def a lot of people that have bought it (unfortunately imo) because that dancing never stops
---
I understand that surveys are never perfect, but some are less so than others
---
What‚Äôs important is what your goal with the survey is. If you get X for a metric, it‚Äôs nothing but ‚Äúnice to know‚Äù unless you put action to it
---
So what ‚Äúaction‚Äù is planned on being taken with this survey
---
Me too! :)
---
The mention of Minecraft was that it‚Äôs not going to be like the Minecraft servers people host themselves
---
It was confusing the first few reads
---
To be fair they also said ‚Äúno human NPCs‚Äù and that‚Äôs changed as well, things evolve, I get it. But, there‚Äôs a way to make them more palatable.
---
Voted- when can we see the results?
---
There's tons of easy solutions to preventing an afk. Welcome to MMO standards of wall running.
---
What do we do with that data though? What good does it do us?
---
Ahh, good ol‚Äô variable ratio schedule of reinforcement. Perfect to promote a healthy, strong addiction üòÅüëçüèº
---
I wish you could plant tarberries as well.
---
This happened
---
Ive had it where enemies strolled into the same bush im in and didnt even see me lol.
---
I believe so. There isn't a single thing original about this game. I loved Bethesda, they were like brothers to me. They were supposed to bring balance to the gamers, not destroy them!
---
Agreed. Using perks like ironclad, barbarian, and evasive with legendary armor makes you way more resilient than power armor
---
I have to try hard, you're so thick that it's quite unbelievable. I shouldn't need to, anyone who's a credible critic agrees with me. Then again, what would someone of your intellectual calibre understand about looking further into a product than "Like way it look"
---
The thing is though, what good does it do is? Do we use that to try to force subscribers not to subscribe? Or do we force non subscribers to subscribe?
---
Even if it‚Äôs great data, what position are any of us to do anything with it?
---
I mean who can resist red?  I look so cute in a little red dress.
---
Believe what you want. I wouldn't believe me either.
---
 ¬Ø\\\_ ï‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î_/¬Ø
---
I swap between a High Cap and Armored based on needs.
---
I meant RAD resist. Autocorrect is being a cunt.
---
I got it thinking it was good not knowing much about it regret it now I'd ask for a refund but I can't be stuffed so know I just deal with the shity 1 month subscription
---
Depends on the sub. I‚Äôd agree that it might have a spread, but adults may be less likely to be on frequent enough to see the post.
---
It‚Äôs also mostly targeting English speakers, so how does that mess things up?
---
Kinda put a few together, any suggestions on a weapon? I dont wanna have to be in power armor all the time except for scorchqueens so probably looking for a bloodied wep/ unyielding armor etc.
---
And would a bloodied explosive 50. Cal those any good ? I'm just a melee build user so I'm use to punching stuff lol
---
I can tell you from playing the game that a good bit of ppl have. I see the armor and emotes enough in game to have say that, roughly 35 - 45% of server pop is subscribed.
---
Edit: at least from my experience on ps4.
---
I‚Äôve worked in ‚Äúthe gaming industry‚Äù for many years, and they don‚Äôt care about anything but how we spend our money.  I am their target demographic. A person who will spend 1000 on release day DLC or such in the first few months then never complain if I never play again.
---
Slightly divergent-yet-concurrent timelines born of the split created from Professor Greebly‚Äôs attempts to save his sick son.
---
Bloodied is ridiculous but you need all the perks to give you the near-invincibility
---
I agree I do not like TS at range, short medium it is decent.
---
They probably aren't. Bethesda just repurposed the Survival servers, which are running the old software but just let certain people login. It's not worth their time or money to make them persistent, which is just one more reason why this is a complete bait-and-switch for those who signed up for 1st.
---
It's totally possible that that guy was crazy though, I mean look what he was up to, something's up with him.
---
This works. I enjoy leading trolls toward the nearest fissure - Speed Demon means that when we pull a SB, I'm going to run and leave the troll in a world of trouble they weren't prepped to deal with.
---
The sad thing is that few people bother to check primary sources. If they did, it'd be plain as day who are reliable sources and who are the tabloid-esque sensationalists like Yongyea and others of his ilk.
---
Hope they release the results. But I have a pretty good idea what the majority of people put.
---
This is true democracy
---
Not against other players in NW.
---
This sounds a lot like Fallout 4. I like it!
---
But I'm not prepared to pay $100 a year for the privilege.
---
But it's not like everyone subbed here is even a tube here. Even smaller numbers.
---
Anytime I bulk junk items I regain space in my stash. I normally bulk when my stash is maxed out so I can fit some more.
---
This was my first time doing something like this. It was very satisfying. If I was even remotely good at PvP I would've just fought them. Trust me I'm not good at PvP.
---
How do you tell? Well, watching who killed you in spectator mode after you died allows you to catch some of it. Back a couple months ago people were flying around the map by somehow accessing console commands and setting themselves to "god mode". Now it's mostly aimbots. There is one where you spectate the idiot using it and it looks like he is just firing mindlessly into the air, but he's still headshotting everyone around him, even through hard cover. Other people try to play it off like they aren't using one, but 10 kills with a sniper rifle 360 headshot no-scoping everyone that comes near them is a pretty good indicator someone is cheating even if they try to tell you they aren't.
---
The one hacker I was having the hardest time with had wall hacks and an aimbot. He could shoot through walls, halfway across the map and kill everyone. Doesn't matter if he cant see you or not.
---
There's no better way to take out a Zerg base and roll back that creep.
---
+1 for stumbling across a fellow Terran Marine.
---
I'm only fair at best myself, I don't build for it. It's not where I get my kicks.
---
I knew, just having a laugh at autocorrect humor.
---
Yeah this won‚Äôt be a accurate poll at all. A lot of people are going to vote no and not even own the game just to get involved with the drama.
---
Yeah just overseer xp. I think we have till the 12th to grind them but the last one is 14,000 xp...
---
Or fortnite, or Warframe
---
I was in that match too. I saw it happen as well. Or the same thing happened again lol.
---
Oh so we‚Äôre back to ‚Äúit‚Äôs the same thing‚Äù again , despite you stating you never claimed they weren‚Äôt different.
---
You haven‚Äôt played fallout 76.
---
Twelve dollars is not pocket money for some non US countries. I am from (and live in) Argentina, where we suffer from inflation. I mean, I could pay for it, but it would cost me like 17 dollars a month (taxes), which translates into more than 1000 pesos a month (keep reading to get an idea of much that is). I already pay for PSPLUS, which is mandatory if you want to play Fallout 76, so I am already paying five dollars a month to play Fallout 76.
---
Now, Netflix costs me  close to 200 pesos a month. Less than a pizza, which is 250. Sure, Bethesda can't take into account my country and its insanity in terms of currency, but... it becomes pricey. I dont think the game (which I love) is worth the subscription. 
---
In fact, I would feel insanely stupid if I gave them more money when shotguns dont work, armor clips through outfits, 250 DR effect still bugs weapons and... well... you know what I mean.
---
You can take your forest armor to an armor bench and apply ‚Äúno paint‚Äù mod to fix the coloration
---
nope if beth started selling weapons and armor that would be my walk away point in the game.
---
Which makes it impossible to grind this stuff out for xp and rank...but I guess Bethesda doesn't get that.
---
You have to choose form over function, or benefits over aesthetics. Bethesda rarely fix things.
---
It *will* make you jittery, the raiders always say so.
---
Outer Worlds has some great content if you don't like blowing up cars and killing robots while people stand around doing mothman dances

Dont say scammed. Thats a bethesda shill trigger word. They downvote for that

your not fucked off yet . thought you were done wasting your time with me . fine shut up already

ü¶ÄGame is trash. ü¶Ä

---
Disapproving of of Bethesda's actions and disagreeing with the choice 1st subscribers makes me the bad guy, I know. Project upon me what you like, I'm not changing my mind.
---
It is awesome I never new I could afford to be a whale.
---
Worth every damn penny it was a good purchase. if you didnt buy the game why are you in this subreddit?
---
Same also it just seems too complicated. Especially armor.
---
Building up high darn near guarantees a SB attack. I didn't know, found a great spot, spent four hours building, left to get more wood, came back to a pair of the big jerks blasting the hell out of everything. Never again.

He's absolutely right, then

They cannot drop. The plan exists, but is not linked to a reward list. (It would have LVLI if it was linked.)

Anybody saying anything otherwise is wrong.
---
since apparently we'll never get a smaller global storage to safely transfer items.
---
well I looked through the rules on this subreddit so maybe it isnt. on other subreddits its really easy to get banned posting bugs because they have strict no showing of hacks and cheats rules.
---
I reported this cheater 2 times and bethesda support gave me a copy paste response 2 times about including the name date time and screenshot evidence. so I reply what exactly do you want from me still no reply
---
I would have gladly paid Bethesda for the ability to host my own dedicated server on my own machine.
---
You can do this with private servers. Leave stuff in a suitcase and then log out- log in with another character and pick up
---
Lol, I'm actually playing through my back log of games. I'll log on get my daily stuff then put on BL3. Then I'll be back into  Bethesda games for awhile as I have all the Wolfenstien games,  the older Doom game and Witcher III to get through.
---
Or I'll play The Last of Us it was free with plus and looks good. 
---
Damn...... I have a lot of games I own which I haven't played yet (this isn't all of them). 
---
I think I need more time.
---
I can't wait til I accidentally burn through scrapping weapons and scrap my tenderizers lol. Just carrying them cuz they weigh less with martial artist
---
Well I have Fallout first so Atoms isn't going to be a problem, but timing is since it ends before the next month of my subscription.
---
They released almost all other items in the bundle as individual items. the plushie, the decorations and the hay bales.
---

---
Upvoting this because having the exact same problem! Can only build 5 for some reason even though it says 5/10 and I have over 50% free  camp budget. Have the necessary perks as well as nothing saved
---
Aaronholt has ten, I hit the spot every time I hu t Alpha wolves. I basically live on cranberry cobbler and purified water, with a few berries juices thrown in for variety.
---
Voted üëçüèª
---
Unless someone else anchors in won't it be a diff server?
---
I like this very much....and then the blue screen
---
The same way there's a non Johnny Cash version of Ring of Fire. By making poor decisions. Also, probably, by blowing the music budget on Wouldn't it be Nice.
---
I voted, but targeting only Reddit for this sort of question may not give you the results you are expecting...
---
All Bethesda comments aside....its a business and a business needs to make money. Shareholders cant put our hours of grinding in the fuel tank of their yachts.
---
You are dodging answering the question, why do you think that making decision that impacts all of your fellow gamers in a negative manner is OK? If I was running around throwing my garbage on your streets, where you walk every day, would you think that would be nice or OK?  You know, because I feel like it, I should be allowed to do wtf I want right?
---
Living in an age of self-entitled people that think every thing is OK because they want to do something, at the expense of other people is pure cancer.
---
And yes, shaming and making people feel like shit for making shitty and bad decision does work more often then trying to convince someone that only cares about themselves to change their bad behavior.
---
I voted ‚úÖ
---
You actually don‚Äôt need a anchor as the server takes 20 minutes to shut down.
---
I‚Äôve done this a few times without issues (so far) just log in character one stash your stuff and log out switch characters then re log into private sever 
---
The blue suit case in pleasant valley doesn‚Äôt have a weight limit so that‚Äôs where I do this
---
Wouldn't it be Nice.
---
That's both a response to what you said, and a refutation of there being no songs by the original extremely popular artists.
---
thats the point, also it adds up more if you buy separate
---
My main thought is the game is still free to play, private servers really do not change anything, private servers are not considered dlc on any game ever made so people shouldn't say they are here.
---
Also these posts about it are getting really really annoying, everyone has been saying the exacts same shit since they released fallout 1st.
---
Sorry but this is dumb. This will in no way be an accurate or useful. People who don't even play the game can vote and you can vote multiple times. You can tell majority of redditors are not a subscriber just by reading the post and comments people have made.
---
Insta-losses? Dude/dudette, you gotta find a better bush to hide in. 
---
I'm pushing for the 2019 hide and seek champ
---
I view it as a Fallout tax I wish I didn't have to but I learned my lesson on FO4. It's just going to happen.
---
This is actually why I won't play NW. Bethesda doesn't seem to care about cheaters.
---
So 1st members can bend the rules to their advantage? Isn‚Äôt that the complaint everyone has already? Lol
---
Yea but I don't want a single other item from the bundle. which makes the 1300 just a bit much for one item
---
Yep, they will do that, just not the smoke machines unfortunately, they are "Exclusive" to the bundle as they put it
---
Answered. Love this idea!
---
they know this thats why they do it it so they can garentee you will spend more for the "exclusive"
---
I'm still enjoying the game just fine. If anything, the sudden influx of new players has raised my enjoyment of the game by a measurable amount.
---
All I know is everywhere I go, Even low levelcamps all have scrapboxes.
---
I must be mistaken. I know I've learned and sold some other plans for pumpkin racks. I could've sworn I had two that were for empty pumpkin racks but yeah, I must be mistaken. I'm not trying to troll anyone. Sorry.
---
Wait do we not get atoms every month?
---
you know nothing about computers and gaming if you think a game can be released without bugs. 
---
you know nothing about business if you think a company is an endless pool pof people and resources. 
---
I use insults on dumb fucks who annoy me.
---
most vault dwellers are just fine its just a small portion of the community that need to be shat out in a gutter and washed away.
---
Still would have led to the same problem. There's no way you could keep up with paying month atoms for the server without paying money.
---
The only way I would have seen Fallout 1st being accepted (certainly more than it has) would just have a subscription for private worlds only and implement a whitelist for your world on launch. That's it.
---
However, doing just that might not justify the high cost of the service on its own. Throwing in the other stuff to them seemed like "look kids, value!" not realising how tone-deaf putting highly requested features like the scrapbox and tent behind a paywall rather than fix the core game as most players would have expected.
---
Could you imagine the scenario where the private worlds launched with a whitelist and was sold for like $5/month (with or without bonus atoms), given the scrapbox and tents for free and sold the ranger armour on the atom store, but also maybe as a free bonus for signing up. It would be such a PR win for fanboys (both current and former) who are desperate for positive news.
---
It's an absolute no brainer. Might even make more money too. But no, they went the tone-deaf, anti-consumer route.
---
That's what a synth would say.
---
I don't want to disrupt the survey, but I do want to see the results
---
They'll add a paid feature eventually, don't you worry.
---
Nice! I like to hear about the positive outcomes!
---
Im not taking the survey since I dont have the game, but I am still curious about the results. Can anyone share a screen shot?
---
More war on Reddit then actually in game ;)
---
Furious. Faster fire and low vats usage are also good. People do not show STALKER the love it deserves: it means you start hitting critical and never miss a shot.
---
I do feel for those outside the u.s, but it's the u.s players saying it's insane that gets me lol. For us its 27 cents a day. You cant really say that's whale money with a straight face. You can literally walk a block and find that in change.
---
Sometimes it will show the person standing but on their end theyre crouching too. I have this happen alot with my friends and im like "YOURE NOT CROUCHING" but they are.
---
Good point about the language mix! I meet a lot of Europeans.
---
That‚Äôs the best, the question is, do you shoot or wait for them to notice you?
---
I'm assuming the algorithm is something like:  
---
&gt;if (client files  ‚â†  default) {  
---
&gt;return = BANHAMMER  
---
&gt;}  
---
&gt;// come back later to flesh out hack detect logic
---
For me the main positive to this game is the random nature of encounters with other players. Some have been jerks, most have been really cool.
---
A few days ago I did One Violent Night, and only two other people showed up, all three of us were in Jack suits and White Wolf fedoras - I think I may have accidentally joined a gang that night.
---
You can't get that kind of random content from computer characters.
---
Voted. Thank you for this.
---
I think the plans you had might've been "Half Empty Pumpkin Rack" ones.
---
I haven't played since outer world's came out, but thats only because it's a new game. Now that I'm about to beat it, I'm stoked to come back home to WV and shoot some radstags. I'm not going to buy 1st, but I have a friend who has it and he loves the mostly private world.
---
Yup, sadly.
---
Really? Hmm. I don‚Äôt know a lot of the time these level 2 dudes will just sprint toward me while I‚Äôm trying to hide. The other day one of them started punching me... I don‚Äôt think he realized I was on his team haha.
---
Gotta new favorite phrase for when I finish doin‚Äô stuff.
---
Yeah, probably.
---
Yes I am lmao in your FACE
---
Todd Howard could literally shit out a crusty peapiece of SHIT and put gold earrings on it and charge $100 for it and I would still buy it
---
There are no shareholders at Bethesda. They're a private company.
---
Lol that's for sure
---
All yours. Think of me when you use it.
---
I didn‚Äôt pay. I don‚Äôt really feel like I‚Äôm missing out. The tent would be nice but that‚Äôs really about it. I don‚Äôt mind people who chose to pay. 
---
That being said i do have a problem with the scrap box. I don‚Äôt think it should be in the game at all and certainly don‚Äôt think it should be paywalled. It is an advantage, clearly. It doesn‚Äôt seem to conform with their guiding principles they laid out in the inside the vault.
---
But how do I think of a giant midget...?
---
&gt;My main thought is the game is still free to play
---
Be careful of your language. It's not a free to play game.
---
Try it.
---
Who is owned by someone
---
Funny how you feel the need to resort to name calling, and yet you feel like your position is morally superior.
---
Most people already pay a monthly internet fee, together with a monthly game service fee, along with a AAA title game pricetag for a game that has had more issues than successes.
---
It is pay to win.  It is the highest price for any similar product.  It is a rip off.
---
Beyond it, there is NO evidence of any discrimination against players who have bought the service beyond what an unsubstantiated article on an unsubstantiated non-news web site has claimed that band wagoners jumped on and started feeling discriminated against.  Boo Hoo Hoo.
---
Dont forget about this one! https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DXRYCZL
---
That‚Äôs great that you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre missing out. I think a lot of people feel the same about the scrap box.
---
It's a very vague question.
---
Happy how? Happy about the state of the game? Happy that I didn't pay for Fallout 1st?
---
athlete archery swimming
---
The game is fun enough as it is. I‚Äôm happy. üëçüèº
---
I wish I was strong enough to solo the high level stuff on a private server alone.  I still need the help of others for sure.
---
From the online wiki:
---
If the player already has the mutation, the serum will still temporarily suppress the negative effects of the Mutation but will not stack the positive effects. For example, purchasing a¬†Marsupial serum and consuming it while you already have the Marsupial mutation will remove the intelligence debuff.
---
So temporarily I guess
---
also there is no "small standard" backpack.. its small or standard
---
This topic is kinda beating a dead horse at this point but IMO the tent and the scrap box should've been available to everyone, either by atoms or by quest(s).  Fallout 1st should've been (1) Private Worlds, (2) bonus Atoms and (3) getting DLC 30 days (give or take) before everyone else gets it.  (Sign up for Fallout 1st to get your Fallout first!)
---
Grindy?  Yes.  Hard?  No.
---
Yeah. Those people are called owners or founders.
---
Voted, I love democracy
---
I think Tadpole quests are not hard, but they certainly are silly. Some requisites are just so stupid, people always do the same three/four ones. (Athlete, Swimmer, Hunter, Archer). That means the others are just wrong. 
---
Bad ideas. Instead of fixing them, they gave us free smaller backpacks. Not the worst thing they could have done.
---
Should've done 4 questions:
---
Do you own FO76  
---
Have you played FO76 since 1st launched  
---
Are you a FO1st subscriber  
---
Do you plan on renewing your FO1st membership/Would you consider   purchasing FO1st in the future  
---
My 2¬¢
---
I wish I‚Äôd gone with any of those but since I was midway through cooking I wanted to finish that one and now I just regret trying at all üòÇ
---
Either way. What ever response makes you happy.
---
Did my part o7
---
The last time I played, I ended up hunting radstags with a black powder rifle for like an hour straight. No matter what people say, that's how I know this game is great. I understand why people are so keen on private world's, it's great to be alone sometimes.
---
I think it was a successful move, because half my Fallout friends were playing private or visiting others before Mischief Night.
---
I did not subscribe, and I never will. And if the next Skyrim/Fallout 5 is planning to walk that path, then I shall take a break and go back to the gym, plant some trees and do something useful.
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed the game less, honestly.
---
Thats too funny.
---
So true. I like NPCs but I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with random people
---
Why would it the scorchbeast blast is a sonic boom not heat or fire??
---
I was very glad when they added in the small backpacks (I guess they must slightly listen to us), just annoyed to find out I had to go back and do the quest I‚Äôd purposely avoided to use the backpack skin. 
---
I agree the tadpole quests aren‚Äôt technically hard but the amount of time it takes to do them is ridiculous just for a slightly better backpack.
---
Voted... to think... if we had all refused to vote, we'd have been released from the vault instead of having to sacrifice one of us at the end.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate. Is there a specific way that FO1st has negatively affected your enjoyment?
---
Doesnt take two have equity in zenimax?
---
its not expensive
---
Completely agree. They totally went overboard.
---
I get lots of 3 star armor, mostly Weightless Combat and Robot Armor. 
---
Weapons, I usually get one (but really good, good) star. Junkie's and Bloodied, which sell fast.
---
Left my vote
---
Anyone who believes that was a fucking moron.
---
I draw the line where your "hobby" or "good time" is unfairly ruining the experience of many other people and harming the game community as a whole. This bullshit is like saying "My hobby is kicking people's pets! I really enjoy it! I get my jollies that way!", and justifying your shitty behavior as some kind of legitimate art-form.
---
I have an idea: My new hobby is punching these idiots in the face, stealing their bank account information, and blowing air-horns in their ears at unexpected times. And it's perfectly OK because it's my hobby! 
---
See how that works? 
---
No, you aren't some kind of "enthusiast" or "artist". You are an asshole. You may enjoy being an asshole, but you are still an asshole. 
---
And their "community" of cheaters? You can call any group of people a fancy name and claim solidarity. But at the end of the day a "Society of Child-Lovers" is still just a gang of pedophiles hanging out together.
---
This bad behavior is not something to be proud of, and most of these dickheads probably make a good bit of side-money selling their cheat methods, programs, and the high-level items they get by cheating their way to obtaining them (I.E. the power armor set for reaching Overseer Rank 100 that was being sold rampantly until Bethesda patched it.). And that crap cheapens the experience of legit players who worked hard to obtain their status-symbol items: Who cares you legit got to lvl 100 if some noob can just pay a cheater 20 bucks to drop him a suit of Hellfire power armor?
---
This is basic preschool-level morality, here! Toddlers and even monkeys instinctively know that cheating/being cheated is wrong. It's just the cheating jackasses who try to fool you into thinking otherwise.
---
You didn‚Äôt ask me a question. And even if you did I don‚Äôt owe you an answer. Perhaps if you‚Äôd have been civil to me to begin with then we could have an adult conversation and who knows maybe you may have changed my mind. But YOU have decided that people need to know that they are making bad decisions (your words), if that‚Äôs not self entitled then I don‚Äôt know what is. And I will say it again, plenty of people have done the same thing on this sub, why are you coming at me?? 
---
Well  I 100% disagree. And who are you to say what is ‚Äòbad‚Äô behaviour? I feel that bad behaviour would be, say, harassing someone for doing something that I don‚Äôt like so yeah it‚Äôs mostly subjective. And actually you haven‚Äôt made me feel shitty at all. I also feel like the time for civil discussion on this subject has passed (or never actually presented itself) and at this point we are just wasting each other‚Äôs time.
---
Honestly gave up on skeleton. I don‚Äôt have enough time during the week to pull it off. I got my combat rifle pumpkin skin, good enough for me
---
Subscriptions aren't inherently a problem so long as the money you're paying is worthwhile to the service provided.
---
Bear in mind that the subscription is the third form of monetisation for this game behind the initial sale price and the Atom Store.
---
Problem is that Bethesda is continuing their anti-consumer practices of selling [pay2win](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win) items, selling back our ideas that we gave them to help fix the core game, making things worse by forcing some of the most highly requested ones behind the subscription paywall.
---
The subscription won't destroy the game on its own. It'll be just another example of why Bethesda deserves their current reputation of being the laughing stock of the gaming industry.
---
It took me less than 4 hours to get the  normal backpack.
---
Oh my god you moron. Please don't make me go to a dictionary.
---
You can get the normal backpack in about 2 hours.  If you are PC I can help.
---
&gt; what the paint and filament cost me
---
I can't imagine you would use filament a second time though. Filament makes sense the first time to get the initial shape but after you've made the pieces wouldn't it be cheaper to use them to create molds and melt plastic to fit?
---
That explains all the fucking morons who are selling steel scrap for 1c each lately. Pro tip: no one is buying it, just like no one is buying your 500c nuke cards or 250c handy blade plans.
---
Fuck. So many stupid people in this game with no sense of economics or pricing.
---
Democracy at work! Don't let the cowards take our guns!! REAL OR FAKE!! They plan to take the REAL guns then the guns from video games, so young people won't even think about a gun. Don't think there's a link between this and that? Ha.....Game Publishers are aware but not to affraid bc they THEY'RE TAKING YOUR MONEY AND EH....DON'T CARE!!!
---
You lost me at the first 6 words of your run on sentence. 
---
But in all seriousness; it's the best content we have right now.
---
It‚Äôs not about it being expensive specifically. It‚Äôs about the fact that they put community requested QoL improvements behind the paywall. 
---
Will people buying it destroy games in the future? Well, it certainly won‚Äôt help. Corporations really only care about one thing‚Äîhow much money comes in. That‚Äôs not inherently evil, it‚Äôs what they exist to do, but when consumers buy their products it tells the companies that it‚Äôs a good move. Generally, they‚Äôll repeat things that make money.
---
Use diluted instead. Soon you have hundreds. Also, try avoiding taking damage. I mean, that works for me. I usually have at least level 1 on the medic or whatever perk that boosts them, on my bloodied build, and on my full health ones I try to have level 2 or 3.
---
I usually never have much of blood backs, so I rarely craft stims. I just pick them up all over and don't use much.
---
It hasn‚Äôt affect me *too* negatively, but I really dislike seeing all these people supporting Bethesda on this decision.
---
Then the answer is no yes.
---
The community makes this game way better than it is, and savor the times like these, as the schisms in the community is making it more, and more toxic.
---
You know reddit is minority right? Like this poll is straight useless. Fallout 1 has enough subscribers to make money otherwise they would have cancelled it long ago.
---
Lol. As a shareholder in a private company I do not need to go to a dictionary. Just because our shares are not publicly traded does not mean they don‚Äôt exist. But yea, call me names. Stock doesn‚Äôt need to be traded on an exchange to exist. 
---
Edit: did not mean to delete original comment. Maybe I am a moron after all lol but to reiterate... private companies can still have shareholders.
---
Game share gang rise
---
*When I'm feeling lonely*...
---
Sorry I‚Äôm not good at explaining things concisely. You‚Äôre right though, with how sparse things to do in 76 are I suppose I shouldn‚Äôt be encouraging them to get rid of content üòÇ
---
Ah thank you for clarifying friend
---
There‚Äôs another way to force them out of a vending screen, but disseminating that info seems like a bad idea.  
---
Alternately, there‚Äôs like a dozen other vendors on the map.
---
I appreciate your dog tactic. Well played. ‚ÄúMongrel‚Äù.
---
This is a good point, considering the state of the sub, people may have even left here, even if they are content with the game, to simply avoid the toxicity
---
Cool!
---
1st mode will close like survival. No interest to play alone. No dynamic, no interactions, less fun, no vendors.
---
I bet 1st in couple of months will be more to get special items like outfits.
---
Controversy? You mean with scrap boxes at most camps? That controversy? 
---
Doesn‚Äôt seem to be exactly that controversial... jus sayin‚Äô
---
For people saying you can't cheat on console I only play this game on xbox and I've seen a few, not many but they definitely exist. The most obvious ones were in adventure mode where they jump halfway up into the sky, teleport and turn invisible in addition to not taking any damage and oneshotting me from God knows where.
---
Thanks for the offer but I‚Äôm on XBox.
---
Plus with how slow my game is it probably takes me 2 hours just to get into a server üòÇ
---
I don't care how much it costs, it's a shitty move by Bethesda locking basic features behind a subscription, especially with the game still being buggy and unstable across all platforms a year later, not much in the way of new content and the base game having mediocre fetch quests.
---
Don't be naive thinking they need the subscription money to fund further development of 76 they're a billion dollar company who have gotten greedy and lazy riding on the success of previous releases.
---
And for people like me I need help on scorched earth type quests.  I wish I could solo but I can‚Äôt.
---
Reddit is always a minority of any game community so this is mostly meaningless but hey.
---
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatecompany.asp
---
You were saying?
---
You're a genius man, very interested in the results! I'd love to also see if this made any people stop playing tho? I absolutely loved the game up until now but I think this was the last straw for a load of people
---
8 successful events over 2 days and my friends and I had a blast... win/win in my eyes...
---
That's the only time they did it and it was only the Nuclear Winter mode.
---
Raider as well, But the chestpiece is so absurd, it actually looks kind of cool with some outfits.
---
I'm not so confident that Wastelanders is coming any time before March of next year, if at all.
---
When it does finally come, it will be pay to play DLC, almost for sure.  Bethesda will have lost so many players, that they will need to make money on the new content that Wastelanders brings.
---
They will say that, because it is bigger and better than the original content that was promised for free, that it is almost a totally new game, deserving a charge. .... or it will only be available to First subscribers.
---
Report show that subscription purchases have exceeded expectations, there‚Äôs no use in fighting back, Bethesda will do what they want and people will pay
---
Lol idgaf about grammar. Had to Google how to properly use a semicolon. I'll admit, some of them suck...*cough* plasma granade *cough* but at almost 1900 hrs...its all I have left. It sucks, I love this game but it's boring. The friends I've made are the only thing keeping me in it
---
Nothing they sell is pay to win. There are valid arguments that can be made about the sub service, but "P2W"isn't one of them, and frankly, is nonsense.
---
Mothmen, ASSEMBLE!
---
What is your stance? Do you still play the game? Have you ever played the game?
---
I have 2, I want the full rack though. :(
---
Edit: my mistake, I didn't realize there was a third "empty" variant available, I assumed it was regarding the half rack.
---
voooooted
---
Same here, I‚Äôve made some really great friends over this game so it makes it easy to overlook it‚Äôs shortcomings. And 1900 hours is very impressive!
---
...you have the empty rack? Are you ps4?
---
Its a completely optional thing to get. The base game and future updates like wastelanders are still playable without it. Private servers were not part of the base game and never explicitly said they would be a free so its not like they took something away from base game players and locked behind a pay wall. The game was never on p2p servers so it wouldnt even make sense to make private ones free, theyd lose money operating. The extra perks like 2nd camp and scrapbox are neither game changing, nor p2w so you get what you pay for, convenience. As someone that does not have fo1st sub nor plan too unless i decide to for a skin that gets an exclusive (ranger armor weasnt enough for me) and even then id prob just do that 1 month, this subscription model doesnt bother me in the slightest.
---
AS LONG AS... all real content updates like Wastelanders/new quests, game modes, events etc, remain free to base game players and dont move to the dlc/subscription model like ESO. You could argue the fridge/scrapbot case but imo its still a QoL add-on that is more of a cosmetic that provides, little to no, real convenience. And if you really want it, the game provides enough free atoms to the base game player to get it, no sub needed.
---
TL/DR: no it doesnt bother me, and ive never bought atoms or subbed to fo1st.
---
It's 18$ canadian for a month, which is the same or a little more than WoW which has a lot more content and less bugs.
---
It's not too bad per month if you buy 12 months, but that's a lot down if you don't have much disposable income. I never have 100$ to spare unless it's my birthday or christmas.
---
You still can do them..
---
Thanks, It was basically petty revenge. I had forgotten to even use the vendor when I was done.
---
I think mamologist is easier than swimming personally.
---
Nah I think you hit the nail on the head for a huge problem. Why is something so simple as a backpack for a boyscout so absurdly effort intensive to earn? It's not like this is got tier endgame equipment. They make you go all of these places and do all these things and every step is riddled with rng and requires intimate knowledge of  the world.
---
Don‚Äôt forget mamologist!
---
Obviously since each server can only hold 24 people (its 24 right I forget) the real answer is only 24 people were left in Vault 76 when it opened.
---
I specifically provided a link to a definition of what pay2win for uninformed responses such as this.
---
Might want to check it out before you comment further.

The jetpack mods make fallout 4 feel brand new.
---
That's gonna be a votes no from me pal
---
Hi guys if you looking for just the right set up to destroy those 1st player dont use a rocket launcher or fat man get a plasma rifle and put the flamer mod on it. Me and a few of my other friends have hit a few bases today lol. We start by finding the player and starting pvp this can happen with them at or away from camp. We normaly find the person doing something then we find their camp. 1 or 2 of our guys try to start pvp while the other 2 or 3 of us wait at thier camp for the pvp pop up. When it pops up we go for crafting stations and extractors first but the real prize is the rad shower they are expensive! Anyway normaly we can also kill the person and take caps and loot super easy lol. Well thats the battle plan emwe have been using.
---
Mine are swapping as well as un-equipping on world changes which is nice..
---
If you‚Äôre on ps4 I‚Äôll gladly take one off your hands.  This isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúpumpkin rack‚Äù mind you.
---
Going to go with "Dead by Daylight"
---
edit: I need to learn how to scroll down the page to see that this was already answered... Doh!
---
Stop giving them ideas, they'll probably implement a text package of 100 messages for $10 in the name of preventing spamming.
---
They are selling P2W items tho
---
Probably because of the weird way they make you craft it with the plan vs apply/mod an existing head. Anyway they really should fix this. Highly recommend you submit a ticket.
---
Not during public events
---
I haven't played 76 for months but have recently picked it back up as I need to build up my resources and ammo ready for the wastelanders dlc. I've hardly got anything stored at the moment. I havent done any events as I'm not interested in using shit loads of ammo and stim paks for a new skin or pumpkin stand. If the wastelanders dlc turns out to be pants then its the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
I will next time I have enough spare time to dedicate a few hours to the game. I think I just spent so much time on cooking because I was too stubborn to admit I couldn‚Äôt finish it and didn‚Äôt want those hours I‚Äôd spent to go to waste.
---
Yeup
---
Haven't seen one cheater in NW mode so obviously you a lying troll! (Sarcasm, yea no cheaters on consoles to my knowledge and you may want to go on afk route\* to get those points)
---
\*Afk route requires you to mark your self No on auto fill slots and if you on PC you can set up an auto clicker. Essentially to keep pressing the button you normally press after match auto kicks you out.
---
I fell like since this post has gotten into popular, people are voting even though they don't play 76?
---
Lots of plastic up there
---
&gt;They initially said they couldn't help the weight of storage
---
How is it that people still don't understand this??  I see this all over the subreddit from people who are apparently incapable of discerning the difference between 500 unique legendary items and 500 wood scraps.  The 500 wood scraps are less burdensome on the server because they don't have mods, attachments, legendary effects, or durability.  The server stores the item ID and the number 500, that's all it needs.  Are they scummy for paywalling unlimited junk storage?  I don't know, maybe.  But ffs let's have some common sense here.  There's a difference between _unlimited storage_ and _unlimited junk storage_.  Just because the servers can handle _unlimited junk_, doesn't mean they were lying when they said they can't handle _unlimited storage_
---
Yea what is he responding to? Context matters here. The question was specifically asking if you can buy legendary mini guns in the shop... his response ‚Äúno, only cosmetic‚Äù as in, only buy skins for weapons. You cannot but actual weapons.
---
God i hate the Outer Worlds circlejerk. The games fucking mediocre at best. All the guns are the same except the science weapons, the dialogue is great however. The AI is the literal shittiest thing ive seen since Skyrim. There's 0 interesting shit in the worldspaces to explore or find, no cool NPCs or anything, no random encounters or anything. Its literally walk like 200 meters and fight a group of 3 enemies or you can fast travel to avoid the constant repetitive groups of 3 enemies. Also its got the Fallout 4 problem where like 90% of the houses dont have interiors and instead have a big metal bar across the doors that say "evicted" or whatever. Sneak attacks apparently don't work because either they don't fuckin die or literally everyone in a 1 mile radius hears the guy you just sneak attacked with a melee weapon. 
---
But people circlejerk the game because Obsidian can do no wrong, just like they circlejerk The Witcher 3 and CDPR.
---
Im not 100% but i believe the only plans you need to have drop are the post launch weapons like the Fixer, Bear arm, and Sheepsquach weapons.
---
Do you think that the stash box and tent should be free for everyone?
---
You don‚Äôt need to power through them. Do a little bit hear a little here. Mamalogist, athlete archer take about  2 hours total to complete if you fast travel.
---
No I'm not
---
At that point you are getting the same amount whether you charge 29 and get tax of 2 or charger 30 and get a tax of 3 .
---
Still too expensive. Really hope Bethesda makes the game free to play and preferably give everyone who started playing at beta 3 month of subscription and less if you started later then that.
---
Hey thanks. It's incredible I've not been able to find pelvis during all this time.
---
Thank you, I only knew about the fixer. Where does the Bear Arm plan drop from? I assume the Sheepsquach weapons are from Free Range or Encryptid
---
Excellent! Saves me having to do it.
---
Now that we've established that some private companies can have shares and some don't, which category does either Bethesda or Zenimax fall into?
---
In other words, provide evidence that they have shares and therefore shareholders. Not investors, shareholders.
---
If you do, I'll stand corrected.
---
And hopefully a credible source like a financial outlet and not Wikipedia.
---
I'm fairly certain the purveyor will not drop heavy armor, unless she's been patched.
---
You'll need to provide proof of the "empty pumpkin rack"
---
This is the 3rd discussion today, and no proof has been provided yet
---
Console master race checking in. No cheaters here.
---
But don't worry Bethesda says they made it more often to get 3 star weapons from 3 star enemies but it only required them to nerf amount of legenaries.(Actually happened when they were reworking it and I forget which patch it was when they did it, same patch as 0 star legendaries)
---
Yes that‚Äôs so true! I don‚Äôt normally go online to look at how to do certain things in games but I find with FO76 I need to have reddit out at all times to explain what exactly I have to do otherwise I would be wandering aimlessly.
---
We used to do this in DayZ at the NWAF. It was hilarious and we usually couldn‚Äôt shoot straight from laughing so hard when we whipped the doors open to shoot.
---
Didn't vote. Decided not to play this crap at the beginning. Glad I didn't. Sorry if you invested time and it hasn't turned out well for you.
---
A crafting bench lol
---
I agree, yeah. If they're going to sell backpack skins, they should fit the smaller one. Tadpole Quests are a pain -- I just did the three photo challenges in the end -- top tip being that a photo of a dead animal counts, doesn't have to be alive. Group events were good for that, like Tea Party. Just walk around with the camera afterwards and snap away.
---
I like fallout 76, when it works. I will likely, though not surely, subscribe eventually, although I wish I didn't have to in order to get the scrap box.
---
I dislike that they told us they couldn't increase the stash limit because it would affect server stability, but now they are selling a way to increase the stash limit. I dislike that they took the second camp idea people were pitching, and put it behind a paywall so people couldn't use caps to unlock it.
---
I dislike that they lied to us that the atom store would be cosmetic only, even if it's not p2w, it's still not cosmetic. I dislike that they said every other person we'd encounter would be another person, but not they're adding human NPCs. (Although I knew that was coming... Really early on.)
---
And I dislike that the game still has bugs from day one of THE BETA. The game has issues with lag, server stability, CTDs, broken mobs, etc. My opinion has always been that they should fix the game first. Now they're pushing for more money, without even fixing it. Yes it's better than it was at launch, but as this event at the whitespring has shown, it's sure not optimal.  
---
I want fallout 76 to become a better game. I want them to FIX what is broken, and I want them to stop lying. I'd HAPPILY pay for the subscription for a year, every damn year(as long as it doesn't go up in price) if they fixed the game, kept on top of new bugs, and stopped adding non-cosmetics to the atom shop.
---
I doubt you will
---
 Persistent worlds aren't coming, main purpose of this venture was to help cover cost of public servers.
---
!remindme 1 day
---
I know. I agree.
---
Just pointing out how lame and not relevant that statement is to the examples provided above.
---
If the example was "OMG. No one asked for a power armor system overhaul and now it's bugged out AF!" and then they said "It just works", makes a little more sense. Still annoying and unoriginal but at least the context is relevant.
---
See?
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Funny you were calling people shills lol. Short term memory there. Stop acting like a victim after you initiated an argument. Keep spewing hate while still stalking the reddit. Like a kid who hates his parents, but wont move out.
---
Bear arm is Project Paradise i believe, and yes sheepsquatch from Free Range and maybe encryptid too.
---
Edit: just Free range for squatch weapons looks like.
---
Yeah, I'm fine. Hasn't effected my game play. Thanks for asking though. 
---
Don't mind seeing other players break out the Robot or Mothman dance either, so yeah -- all good here.
---
I've only found very few of them, I've made them. And use the gun sparingly
---
Voted üëç
---
there is a way tp become immune to Scorchbeast blasts  
---
but its not the Fireman Outfit
---
Fuck no. I didn‚Äôt even buy that trash game. (Answered the poll, too)
---
No, fallout first is trash
