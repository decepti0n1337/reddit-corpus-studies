A dps that should make sure they have a tank with them.

Okay, thanks! I'll check it.

Yes I have. I’ve even uninstalled and reinstalled. Rebooted my router. Cleared fallout save files. Cleared other games off my hard drive. 
---

---
I’m at a complete loss.
---
That message is also glitchy as hell, as is actually taking the pylons. There have been several times where I've clearly seen that the pylon is buzzing with electricty, and yet the message on screen says it's not claimed.
---
SEveral other times I've gone to claim one, and it takes 30 second of repeatedly pressing the switch, while getting ass fucked by level 50 gutsys.
---
Haven't done this event in months. There's easier farming elsewhere that doesn't include this kind of issue. They call pvp players the griefers...
---
Havent been able to find anything online about it dropping from anything but mire specific events. Barely any info on it at all really
---
I wanted to hear!
---
The events in general are a big mess.   Distant thunder, for example.  The rewards have been plans for T60 motion assisted servos most times I have done it.   I got plans for T51 torso and T60 legs.  Those are not hard to farm and you really don't need plans for them.  Events don't need endless three star legendary drops. But faction based plans would totally make sense. The current reward system makes almost no sense.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As you said, the horde events are a problem but the events in general are kind of lackluster.
---
Can't that get you banned for using those kind of mods though? Sorry, ignorant to the mod scene for this specific game.
---
I know im holding my atoms for a nice internal framed one. They’ll probably be on a weekly atom store rotation.
---
Try selecting the "Manage addons" option for FO76 from the XB screen, then clear reserve space.
---
Nah. Not for me. But companies like this don’t make a habit of saying when someone gets punished.
---
Even if My report doesn’t do anything, eventually someone’s will be the straw that broke the camels back.
---
Note to sell sell any of those I find for higher price. Chinese goods are rare.
---
in used to be real good in f3 and I didnt even over repair it.  I think it was nerfed in fo4.
---
This...Deathclaw were a bane to steer clear of in New Vegas.  Level wasnt really a factor.  They were just bad ass and hard to kill.  Now even a top lvl Deathclaw is a hamster waiting to be accidentally dropped.  They should be an end game challenging enemy.
---
Hey, to each his own.  Last week my mutants were all naked, talk about uncomfortable.
---
If no one's set up camp nearby, it's possible the area has been marked as a quest area by Bethesda, which means future quests will take place there, and therefore the area becomes a no-build zone.
---
As I peruse the sub reddit more I realize you must be referring to challenges lol.
---
Where were you at?
---
Neff said bub.
---
I couldn't afford to pay what other players wanted for good legendaries...
---
That's why I started scripping.
---
Pretty much anything other than the current system would be and improvement.
---
Oh boy have I. At the Ranger Station 4x in the last month.  Level 188. MURDERED ME 10x. 
---
Excavator with medic pump. Instigating shotgun which performs beautifully despite the recent nerf. Adrenaline 5x. I was stoned on chems too.
---
I felt like I was in PvP. I threw everything I had at it. Went through 15 nuka grenades like they were water.  4 of his buddies showed up and wiped the floor with me.  At one point I screamed. 
---
Then last night at the train yard by Distant Thunder him and two of his buddies sent me flying into the sky. 
---
There were two other high levels throwing their weight in, one was in sentinel gear and I died 5x.
---
It actually circled my corpse. Daring me to respawn.
---
Jfc I haven't been this scared in a game since Pyramid Head.
---
They are in my stash, but placing whole items in your stash does not protect them from being autoscrapped if your crafting/repairing needs that resource.
---
It will pull from the raw item pile first first, but after that any and all junk is up for grabs whether it’s on you or in your stash.
---
I also lost all the little model robot figures when I needed aluminum.
---
It’s a trivial issue, but this seems like a plausible temporary solution.
---
It’s fun if you’re bored in the game. I had a group leveled at 40, 5, and 8 ask me to join their team after we did an event together. After we played for a bit, I asked if they wanted to join the Enclave. The level 40 was the only one that backed out after mentioning Death Claws. I told the other two that they should get in two shots quickly then run behind me. I think they each got 6-8 levels out of 2-3 hours of play.
---
I want it, still have a recall card to use later but how many attempts did it take?
---
I have tried that a couple times.
---
Dingdingding - Seems we have a deal!
---
Same PSN as here?

4 badges today, it's works!
---
Ooh, sorry. I will obey all rules from now on. Didn't mean to sound contentious, like I said I'm not a huge fighter of  scorch beasts, and you are so right to make rules that square with your objective. Just sayin' don't blame low level people that aren't familiar with the rules if they happen to wander over there. I have always been treated well when I go there. I honestly didn't know about the logic,  consistent with your rules. Don't blame me for my comment. I didn't use profanity and I thought I was making a point for lower level people's sake. God bless the "QUEEN", FOR SBQ's sake!
---
The pieces go for 300-500 each, theyre a common drop from SBQ. The mods go for alot more with jetpack and cal shocks being at the top end at about 2500-3000.
---
I know right?
---
Only hurts me that I asked a level 150 player for tips, and he had told me to never scrao junk before depositing in case there was quest items in it.
---
Guess he played my ass
---
I thought you can bulk all of them while they are in the stash, you have to take them out to do that??
---
I’d like to see a nerf to bobbleheads/magazines if it means we can equip them and have it be a permanent buff.
---
I got super frustrated when I decided to hop on today for the first time in a while. Someone nuked Whitesprings so I decided to head over and do some killing. Except there was this level 200+ player running around literally one shotting everything with a power fist. Couldn't even tag anything. So, being bored with not doing anything I see Uranium fever is up and hop over there. No sooner do I arrive than that same player shows up and does the same thing. I finished the event just for the rewards you get straight out, but damn was that annoying.
---
I was only into lockpicks already but even the safe rewards just aren't worth the trouble most of the time.
---
Kay thx for the info
---
They only feel like a chore compared to other dailies/weeklies because they require you to socialize, which a large portion of the community (a vocal one online) seems to despise. imo the camera challenges are a lot better than the craft 50 alcohol ones or the radstorm ones.
---
I have. Got lots of milk!
---
Last time I made a report they emailed a follow up asking if I had video.  What do you normally do?
---
Assassin Cavalier, unyielding sentinel, legacy energy weapon, bloodied SS bat all at player vending machines
---
My teammate runs this build.  I am melee dominant, but not bloodied. Opinion: (Op), and do excellent damage to the Queen, but I'm not bloodied.  I am a tank with Melee/ heavy guns ( that will put her on the ground faster than not so he can bring the pain) build.  We each do our thing for maximum speed for kill.  We put down 2 Queens in about 15 minutes a couple of weeks ago off 1 nuke.  Our average is about 17 minutes per Queen barring glitches. I have seen a 8 minute kill with the right server participation.
---
Can we give away the Broken ones to ppl who haven't yet started the Bucket List quest?
---
Got it here. Based in Australia. Pretty comprehensive and in depth. https://imgur.com/QcMOgNF.jpg
---
Why do they even see you? I'm crushing em in caution, one or two swipes. And that is without ninja damage bonus.
---
In process of moving perk points from action boy or lone wanderer to ninja, so I can crush these bitches with 1 stab of a serrated combat knife.
---
Yes, this please
---
I bet you're right
---
System?
---
Have you tried rotating it? Maybe that's what did it for me.
---
Sorry PC
---
gg on getting the pack, I'm still wondering around trying to kill bugs and figure out what I need to do exactly for it, something about dolly sods. I've had quite a few non hostile encounters which is good because most people seem to say it's all kill on sight. I'm on PC so that doesn't help. Good luck out there wastlander.
---
Ah bummer. I'm on ps4
---
Got a stacked foundation base on one of my characters, makes an excellent impenetrable castle to keep the mobs out!
---
This is pretty cool and it is neat how the community does little player made events like this, another I saw was a lottery, and I think it is cool that there are people like you that will make an event for everyone else, I think it shows that the community really cares about this game and is trying to help BGS fix the mess they made
---
Thanks for this one, I walked the railroad until I found some. Nothing else worked.
---
Sometimes people will just place their camp unit, and not build anything, happens to me all the time, granted I live in a popular spot.
---
I have a comrade chubs for sale for 6969
---
I stop a benches all the time and scrap any junk I collected. Keeps my weight under control.
---
Nah I dont even mind the challenges... BUT EVERY SINGLE DAY
---
At least they look you in the eyes, mine look away when they smash me.
---
Well I get where they're coming from, cause it makes it easier to complete those quests if you already have the unbroken item but those situations are limited.
---
In my mind do the research to know what junk not to scrap or just accept in those rare instances you'll need to farm those items. Stash juggling for me is more of a pain than not having that junk on hand.
---
I love you!!!!!
---
Maybe , but then if the workshop is claimed by another player in the server you are entering, would it take it away from the other player?
---
I have an assassins +40% attack power Deathclaw gauntlet on PS4 if you’d like to make an offer on it
---
Anthonybundy71
---
Ill be impressed when you kill them with one stick of a switchblade.
---
Also the nuka cola quantum power armor paint
---
Correct  my psn is the same, im originally bad and use the same online handle. 
---
My door will reopen soon as im at work and i left the console on for shop goers. (It might have shut off by now though)
---
PS4? I’ll die for you. If you’ll for me.
---
Not really I’m still having this issue. Super frustrating when I really want to farm Legendary scrip for Thursday but apparently I won’t be able to max out before then. Did you try submitting a ticket and reach out to the community managers on Reddit?
---
Jack did
---
Appalachia has been pretty good to explore, for sure. I wouldn't mind seeing something out in the Rockies next. Denver was pretty bad before the war for various riots, if I remember.
---
OwO
---
Is it for only one character? Try a different character if that doesn’t help I don’t know what could be wrong
---
Sure. PSN?
---
You can't shoot something a single time because you are charisma based?
---
Jafar_quenton_7. I don’t have a mic, btw.
---
I know how you feel! I’m on PS4 also and looking for  more players! I can join you in a couple of hours if you’d like.
---
Pemmican is a reward from the new quests, got the second batch myself from that goofy bug parts one.
---
I'd help ya with the s'mores but I'm on PC
---
Wait what?.....i had no idea....no wonder the .50 cal felt like it killed shit faster that my plasma and laser........ty so much for this post....so for now you need a AAB .50 cal
---
There’s a known issue where a small number of people can’t play on their main accounts. Mines been glitched for a week as well. Super frustrating with the legendary vendor right around the corner.
---
But why? 
---
Why do they have to be a permanent buff? Why can't they remain as a temporary buff?  Your post provided a desired effect but you haven't explained why it was necessary in the first place. 
---
Again, it's more than needing a nerf - even if they were weakened it's still a change in difficulty, and most content is easy enough without needing the consumables (which is why as someone else posted no one is buying them, they aren't necessary)
---
IF you have multiple accounts, you can set exorbitantly high prices on your camp vendor.
---
world?
---
It is really frustrating. I’ve submitted a couple tickets now. I haven’t reached out to the community managers tho.
---
This is why I play an explosives doctor
---
It's especially bad if you recall that one of the express purposes of perk packs was to give us cards we didn't have so that we could experiment with things we might not otherwise pick.
---
Are you on ps4? I had a similar experience
---
I was just thinking for the challenges and badges that require the camera.
---
Guess they got tired of paying Atoms. I stopped doing challenges, too.
---
The description of the concept art says "*not all of these made it into the game*" and I assume the others will probably be added to the atom shop, and hopefully eventually the world as time goes by. The only ones I know of right now are the standard green, the Tadpole scout, and Possum scout skins. And in case you're wondering, the Possum scout skin is pretty much the standard backpack with scout logos on it.
---
Nah, they should do the same thing they do with CAMPs. If someone owns that workshop (camp spot) give us the option to hop to another server. Or maybe BGS could find a way to automatically throw you into a server where the workshop simply isn't already taken
---
Do you know by any chance if refrigerated is equal to rank 3 good with salt?
---
Does lead lined mod provide hidden % reduction to radiation like pa frame or not?
---
I'm trying to find answers to those questions before i will buy mod for my back pack, no luck so far 😞.
---
This. Saying you did some damage reads like you're there not to contribute significantly but just get chip damage in for xp &amp; loot.
---
Not saying that's what you do, just the way you present yourself in this post.
---
But does it complete a challenge if your gallery is full and you take a picture?
---
I mean... I give cameras away. They're easy to make. Just bring me a broken pro snap deluxe. Beyond that, I've posted this so many times and will keep posting it every time I see someone talking about how hard it is to get the tourist. Server hop at the light house, you can see him from where you spawn in (depending on your view distance. I recommend running up the hill and by the time you reach the top if he isn't there, hop servers.
---
This is happening far too commonly during Campfire Tales as well. The Nia Wendigo is way too easy to kill for the amount of people that usually show up to the event and blast the shit out of it with their explosive handmades.
---
They must have been buffed either on purpose or by accident. If anyone thinks we are exaggerating, poke one and see. Lol. Christ
---
Because this is the internet I shall do the following in regards to your poster:

&gt;OwO
---
This just reminds me of the crazy things people would build on Wildstar. I can only wish that some day we get a housing system that even comes close to what you could do there.
---
One of the keycards for the quantum paint is there. I have both Nuka plans in my shop if you want to save some caps. RB1955 at Top of the World on PC.
---
So disappointing, It’s one of the most unique blades in fallot. Oh well. I also got confused when someone offered 9k for it.. I’ll bury it in my stash i guess.
---
They'll be auto scrapped if they're the only source of leather on hand
---

Just south of robco research. I know there’s a random encounter near where I saw the Brahmin, but the Brahmin roamed down the street if that’s what it was.
---
Yeah, that makes sense
---
You didn’t see anything else just a pack Brahmin
---
Yeah that’s been kinda normal since the newest patch. Placement lag, not being able to place things cause they’re “floating” but actually aren’t floating, and a few other camp issues.
---
Go and test it you mook. I know for a fact I'm right, I can throw grenades at my feet all day long and take zero damage. I can shoot explosive weapons at my feet and take zero damage. You are taking damage from the bullets, not the explosive effect. You don't know what you're talking about.
---
Oh ok then disregard me lol thank you
---
What? You don't get bonus stats?
---
What's the point of over-repairing now? I get for auto weapons but may as well not bother for single shot weapons.
---
We don't strike this zone for flux.  Our goals are different, and no one has data that suggests one over the other but our opinions stacks well.  I usually wait until the zone clears of radiation before I go in and collect flora anyway.
---
Almost but the one I found ingame looks cooler with all metal playing pieces.
---
Just a heads up the white springs butler duping method has sorta been patched as of rn. The servers went down at abt 11 this morning and now they all say “busy” even when they’re not so it’s impossible to trade w them and dupe items that way rn
---
That’s literally not true lol? My past 4 Fallout 76 videos have all had a positive spin.
---
There are legit things to criticize there is no reason to make things up
---
I used to run GC all the time, I had 2 spawn a few occasions, I believe its because the prime fissure is so close to the end of the tunnel, that it happens to "dig" down into the cavern.
---
How about PvP without Stealth Boys?
---
Maybe it was a visual glitch for me, or maybe if it's a wide caution (like almost hidden) it works? Idk, the last event it was a wide caution and I wasn't losing health.
---
Oh okay I see.. yeah don’t know then. The Brahmin that travels with the responder bot at Charleston is called that but I wouldn’t mind getting a new traveling vendor!
---
I can make smores on ps4, u need 1 brahmin milk, 1 spices, 2 sugar, 2 syrup, 2 razor grain flour each
---
&gt;  Tbh I was actually getting scared that they’d be able to track me down irl 
---
really?  I mean really really?
---
Alright, this set just includes the "Scene" type of random encounter: https://pastebin.com/8A1jDt8Q
---
When it's done, I'll verify some of them in-game, although I'm pretty confident that it's solid.  After that, I'll go ahead and finish extracting the other 3 types.
---
If you'd rather not publish it until it's verified, feel free to send it in a DM.  Thanks again!
---
There was a post about it last week, with a Bethesda reply.  And several since then. The posts just aren't getting enough love to stay on the front page.
---
IMO, the new airport is WAY too linear.  You're steered through it, with the notes and such placed directly in front of you.  They were nice enough to put a one-way shortcut to the exit though.  The story updates are nice, too.  It helps you get more of a feel for what brought &gt;!the Responders !&lt;to their end.
---
No difference for me.
---
It's NOT random!
---
Tbh I didn't even think it was intentional, I just know everytime they add a change to the ticks, for example robots exploding after 10 seconds being a new thing, the rest of the caculations go off the charts. Remember back when robots exploded immediately, that was caused by tinkering and unfortunately caused a lot of issues with everything else time based. I never thought they intended to mess up the timer to sell fridges in the Atom shop or something(which I totally think they won't sell them in the atom shop, just skins)
---
Of course it’s not unhealthy to work that much, because that’s working, not gaming. 😓
---
I didn’t call it unhealthy.
---
I didn’t exaggerate.
---
It is literally over half a day.
---
I decided it’s a lot because to me, that’s a lot. Therefor I say it’s a lot.
---
Anything else? If not, drop the napoleon complex and move on.
---
This ranks up there with the guys with melee PvP builds who harass people in PvE mode who they see using ranged weapons. I had a guy following me around a few days ago hitting me repeatedly shit talking me for not fighting him. Yeah let me just enter PvP right here while you're hitting me in the face and I have zero chance using any tactic that benefits my build.
---
There is, you are just so afraid to speak.
---
I feel like it’s gotten worse for me on PS4 in the past few days. Delayed loading and rubber banding, especially at whitesprings/enclave. Overall it’s not terrible but I feel like it’s not quite as stable as it was. Dont know if the duping issues that popped up had an impact on that again
---
Will probably be this way too until they get a good battle rhythm down. Hotfixes currently take them about 1-2 weeks, and a lot of the painful bugs are still in game half a year since launch. It definitely takes the patience of a saint to hang in there with Bethesda while they get the multiplayer aspect figured out. I’m hoping that as time progresses and they learn more about running a live service multiplayer game, the time between patches will grow shorter
---
You get double the lifetime of a weapon, just no damage buff. It's always worth it to over repair.
---
Yeah no thanks, that’s a hard pass for me.
---
30
---
Why don’t people team up during events like this?
---
Definitely worth it for the backpack.
---
You actually don't understand why there is no viable reward for it? Here is a hint: afk people.
---
Obviously not f2p lmao
---
“If it was worth the time.”
---
This was the douchebag part, as well as your other, longer post which makes it clear that I’ve offended you somehow. I went out of my way to come back and edit my second post to make sure the guy knew I wasn’t being rude. That’s the difference.
---
I can’t remember if it’s Denver or Detroit but one of the two in completely overrun by giant packs of dogs
---
Poison of all varieties seems affected since last patch, cause the queen has been wrecking lately too.
---

Yea, I noticed hard to find outfits tend to sell out quick....it's crazy what people are selling Faschnacht things for though..
---
I’m making a new character for farming and I need to regrind for levels now
---
I’d be happy to sell you about 100 aluminum for 1 cap each :)
---
And requiring a piece of equipment that is damn near impossible to get to complete the challenge is a bigger foul. I’m looking at you, Bethesda, for making that damn tourist camera a variable location spawn instead of a fixed spawn site. I STILL haven’t found it. I suppose players that have a limited time window to be on aren’t that important to them.
---
Yeah it’s Denver, also known as Dog City
---
For my part, I did see Grahm at the Lakeside Cabins workbench when I was holding it.  Unfortunately, I still do not have a camera!
---
Triangular foundations and ceilings too!!!!
---
Hey man if you get on today let me know I'll be on for a couple hours
---
If only the Sheepsquatch would stop being on my ass all the time so that I can actually do this
---
Lile dude-lady-robot-sheep-thing, I know my character has a nice ass but she doesn't swing that way. Please keep your claws to yourself.
---
What I hate the most is that you can do many of them easily if you have friends who play this game. Are they actually laughing at us for playing alone or do they not understand that it's not the most popular game and it's hard to play with somebody?
---
I've finished Archaeologist, Atomics, Electrician and Photographer so far.
---
Atomic Fan was probably the easiest and I think you can bash enemies with Fatman for kills.
---
Magazines obtained from other players don't count for collector, even if you eat them. 😒 I even tried dropping them on ground and picking them back up and still doesn't register.
---
None of the "Play instrument" musician ones work for me. I've tried every one at the specific locations and tried them in my own camp, in workshop, in others' camps, on multiple servers, after relog, and they never work.
---
Do you think there will be classes like apex or would everyone start with the same load out?
---
I hated Rose.....
---
rubber is the crappiest part to find for this method. most of mine is from scrapping assault rifles.
---
Depends if it's bugged or not
---
Not necessarily but losing 50, 5 times could be for a player who is trying to figure things out. 
---
Killed by a p*ssy stealth boy should not pay out as much.
---
Full disclosure, I do not PvP but the videos are there for all to see.
---
It's NOT skill, simply "build".
---
My main point is, if the penalty wasn't so high, more PvPers would shrug off a kill an re-engage.
---
Don't know if the refrigerated mod is equal to Good With Salt, unfortunately.
---
Lead lined does not give you the hidden radiation resistance of PA/hazmat suits from the reports I've seen.
---
half size stairs would be awesome as well for small platform transitions.
---
I'd like a plasma rifle skin, maybe one to give it the coloration of the Q-35 matter modulator from NV? or a skin to give it the classic "bulb" at the end of it barrel
---
Occasionally they spawn underground in a texture glitch cave...  i put a vending machine down there with almost free 3* legendaries Champaign and confetti plans.
---
Hard to be blind
---
Congratulations, welcome to the big leagues my man
---
So you think they adjusted the reward in the off-chance that someone leaves their console/PC on for nearly an entire year 24/7 (not forgetting to rejoin session when you kicked every half hour)
---
Nope, I think that afk people were not a factor, especially as being afk gets you kicked, being in a session too long get;s you disconnected and just playing the game has a chance of a bluescreen. 
---
Hell if someone managed the full 7600 years entirely 'afk' then they deserve the full 40 atom points and tenfold more.
---
I target Bloody, AA, Instigating, explosive, +VATs Dmg effects for weapons and Unyeilding, Bolstering, Weightless, Sentinel, Cavalier, AP refresh, and weight reduction on armor. Anything else is pretty useless to me so I don't expect anyone else to be interested really.
---
Then the better the effects fit the item, how many good effects it has, along with how the effects fit with each other on the item,  the higher I charge. I don't really look at an items in game value at all.
---
Any mods like Deep Pockets on CA, or Dense on chest pieces as it took a long time for me to find certain plans and after scrapping tons of armor with really high intelligence I've yet to learn Dense for any armor. Found multiple Dense mods for different armors but no plans. So thinking like a buyer I'd pay more for a piece with mods I can't make myself.
---
For anything else I just see what a vendor would pay me then charge that amount. I don't sell Screws and other useful junk that might sell at higher prices.
---
After the God Tier items started circulating en masse though I've noticed my sales dry up and have dropped all my prices just to make it enticing for the buyer. Can't sell items for what I think they're worth when you can get something waaay better for a bit more.
---
My $.02 after playing 500 hours and enjoying vending a lot since launch even more now that I can just toss it in a machine instead of making LFG posts and bugging randos to check my stock.
---
It's my favourite outfit for my unarmed character! Didn't cost me that many stimpacks though, accept your inevitable death and keep punching the robo sheep to oblivion!
---
I gotta try that
---
I'm running the chameleon mutation, so I am full weightless with some weight reduction and sentinel perks. I also maxed out all of the stealth perks if that helps ya.  So not crazy, just super sneaky.
---
Go in with absolutely nothing (even clothes) into controlled arena. Just your special &amp; perk cards.
---
Explore for resources &amp; loot to gear up, craft &amp; establish an outfit. Set up ambushes &amp; lay traps.
---
That's the only way I'd bother considering that game mode. Going in with your own gear only advantages exploiters &amp; those that can afford to put in tons of hours into the game.
---
I really wouldn't mind if the half foundations we're diagonal either, or even having some form of a rounded version. I wanna make nice little balconies and patios.
---
They don't work with PA. Bethesda said they gave us misinformation
---
Oh they are not the same for everyone? :o I guess I have been wasting shit.
---
Man that is a bummer
---
What does tse mean?
---
I’m you 50th upvote at lvl 50
---
Unless things have changed, service life of sniper rifles &amp; revolvers for example are long as is.
---
If you have the over-repair perk cards already, sure. Thus makes me reluctant to explicitly choose them unless the weapon absolutely requires it.
---
A team death match or a free for all would be better than a BR,
---
two Shot explosive. Basically, it's an EXTREMELY good gun
---
hmm, interesting. makes sense when you put it that way.
---
I can get on now
---
Reasonable.
---
That would be lovely
---
I hope not because I’m not sure I’ll ever be bothered to jump through the hoops required to get a backpack. 🤦‍♀️
---
Uh huh. I know you're getting down voted but you're completely right. The way to teach an asshole to act better is not to be an asshole in response because it just reinforces their behavior. If you take everything out first it because they did, it proves to them that they were doing wwhat they had to do.
---
Instead, if you get your tags on and then kite them up to the high level and make it clear on voice chat that you're doing the right thing, even if they aren't, it's the only course of action that will make someone like that second guess themselves.
---
Ah, being on ps4 I think it’s more automated. But I also have it set so that I can hit a button and the last 15 minutes of gameplay and audio are recorded. I usually keep that stuff for a month or so before I need to clean my hard drive.
---
Yeah, this is a huge problem.
---
Is it the same map or a sub map? Cause if it is a sub map it could be f2p.
---
Why?
---
2* wood chest
---
I’m not saying it’s coming out, but i saw it’s been teased.
---
lvl 35
---
What does TSE stand for?
---
Red dead has a battle royale and its not f2p lol, for all we know so far its not even a mode, it can very easily be just inside a vault.
---
Congrats :D . Now you could play the game.
---
I got one shot at release by one in glassed caverns. It's not new, just rare and random.
---
SO legendary enemies have special effects on them, allegedly depends on their glow effect. Though whether this is always working is debatable. I also have no idea whether muti star enemies get more auras. Would need a dataminer for that.
---
Some have defense buffs, some have offense buffs. Mirelurk kings are already one of the most lethal opponents in the game because of how poison works.
---
Did I say that? And the tease is through data mined files where we can make our own context, it hasn’t been teased officially my guy
---

---
All patched
---
Also excellent is my comedy vampires ripper. No damage to either side.
---
Agreed on this one. What a bunch of tedium. And half bugged just for extra points.
---
Kids play it sooo much and it is over rated
---
Good to know!
---
I’ll start gathering the ingredients...
---
Oh dang. This is a game changer.
---
Two Shot Explosive 😊
---
It’d be good if the double-barrel shotgun could fire twice at the same time.
---
Reminder that if you finish enemies too far for their spawn, they will often meatpile back to their original spawn point. This is especially. The case in whitesprings, where the meatpile timer is low because of the mob count.
---
Get an extra 2 for me too
---
Two shit explosive
---
Its patched...
---
Well, I can say that this definitely works! Unfortunately, I had to learn through experience. Three out of three days in a row. Always happens to me when I am doing something in my Pip Boy.
---
Do you have a list of what all is missing?
---
I checked the Reddit page today boss.....
---
The mice are still chasing the cheese as planned.
---
Are you standing back by the udder when you try to milk them, like you would for irl cows? I seemed to have success milking more often from that spot.
---
You can't just patch off a hydras head, patch one method two more rise up
---
The stair platform has always been buggy and breaks whole bases if placed!
---
I’d like that a lot. Let it be destroyed. Let it be repairs when they log in or not, but this would mesh SO well with the server hop feature that was implemented earlier.
---
Yeah!!! I was doing that too but for some reason it didnt take into consideration anything that wasnt junked
---
I was thinking cascading fountains, but sure.
---
It would be nice to be non human.
---
Not working for me. Haven't played in months, and this is no small part of it.
---
Well, if you have the right gun, you can one shot some gutsys/eyebots and still be hidden. But it's risky, so I try to save that til the imposter is almost dead
---
The nature of consuming a bobblehead/magazine is so incongruous from every incarnation we've experienced before. 
---
In recent iterations of the franchise, these were collectibles. Something to prize and cherish; even put on display as a sort of trophy. Now you're asking us to consume them? It just makes no sense.
---
In Fallout 4, bobbleheads bestowed a permanent buff. Why not retain some semblance of their existing nature? They don't have to be *exactly* the same. You could just have one active bobblehead/magazine that you carry around with you (equipped). 
---
It's a shame that no one's buying them. I think it speaks to the distortion of their true nature. Why even bother with this temporary piece of trash?  They could be essential elements of a build. They could be great...
---
Universally understood, indeed! Besides, they're too busy laughing to attack!
---
If it keeps coming at me, I just run off for awhile and then sneak to grab the pylons. Speed demon mutation is your friend.
---
😂 that was great do you have any cobalt stable flux

No idea though they seem to be scrappable to bone
---
I fast traveled to a camp in the Mire because it was near a quest marker, it spawned me in the camp. I tried to get out and all the doors were locked except one that went to an upstairs balcony. The owner was there in a chair but didn’t react to me, probably afk.
---
If it is in a cell then I think they could make it f2p. I agree though that yes some games do not do that style (Red Dead) but some do (Fortnite)
---
What was your number one priority for them? Mine was Fix Bugs!
---
Lots of questions about PvP...
---
I thought refined did more crit?
---
Well, we pick up ammo in boxes so why can't we box ammo in other words. If we could break down bulk ammo to their base components and be able to buy it with our vendor. This would entice me to actually have a vendor at my camp.
---
I'd also like to be able to create DU ammo (anti armour) but I can't.
---
o7
---
what about the cave that you go through to get the voice lock key for the enclave questline...multiple dropping piles and 2 roaming deathclaws?
---
Critical.50 does, Refined does higher damage (not as much as a Hardened however)
---
You can’t get a TSAA lever action, has to be one or the other.
---
I ran across one who poisoned with his echo scream........lmao PA means nothing against that, couldn't use stimpacks fast enough to keep up either
---
Ballistic shield: +90DR +30 carry weight
---
And I think the lead-lined one is +90 rad resistance
---
I don't think the ppl that are banned think its intended.
---
We already have a mini game in 76, it’s called “Crashing”
---
I would be fine with the level up one if it didn't have such stupid fucking rules attached. Level up while naked? While under level x in a specific area? While diseased? Sure, I'll get myself up to 99% of the way to the next level, then run around five minutes putting myself into a crazy situation so I don't have to grind out three levels in one day...what a stupid fucking decision that is.
---
Most likely, it's a way to send collected junk back to your camp. They mentioned the idea on their repair kit post.
---
Go to the map screen in game, go to the menu that has like character, map, social, etc.. the third or fourth should say challenges. If you click on challenges and then scroll down the world challenges are there
---
Same place as the world challenges you can complete for atoms
---
Ok, thanks for the reply
---
I'm on PC and have been having major issues doing the same, hope they fix it soon!
---
I think the legendary vendor is supposed to be this week at some point?
---
I think the new content comes on 16th, like the purveyor, it’s all in the latest ‘In the Vault’.
---
I think they think the perk card system is working as intended. Which is accurate. 
---
Its a pretty neat compromise in a system where nerfs can change weapons you might want to use, and it doesn't permanently penalize you damage wise if you want to craft. To balance this system, an inconvenience is introduced.  You can adjust your perks around a weapon or strategy, and change them again when you need to craft, but you have to manually do it.  That's the price. 
---
However, with that being said, if I were to redesign it, the pure crafting cards (Makeshift Warrior, Gunsmith, Armorer) would be removed and be replaced with a passive, levelable skill that you attain through faction quests.   I might be tempted to include Chemist, Scrapper, and Ammosmith into that list as well, but probably not Super Duper. 
---
I would then lock perk cards to switching only at Camp, station, or vault.  I'd also limit the number of cards you could equip per Stat based on your current (not permanent) Intelligence so that int effects would be more of a penalty.
---
From what I understand that is where the dying method is, could be the probldm?
---
Ah ok. It doesn't effect ap cost either does it?
---
Beth probably just forgot to update it most likely
---
Oh okay. So basically nothing for the usual Tuesday update
---
That's terrible. People could be server hopping for ages just for their camp to not overlap someone else's, particularly on popular spots.
---
Nothing Interplay shit out killed the franchise and Bethesda has made it vastly larger and more profitable then they ever could. It ain't going fucking no where
---
That gauntlet is a nice thing, but I'm confused as hell as to why he hasn't put the third claw mod on it.

Awesome I had to step out for just a bit but I'll get on in like 10 I gotta help my dad get the keys out of his car

The event can only start in Cranberry Bog just keep an eye on the events going on in that region.

Have you went to the machine to see how many you have? Possum badges don't register in my collections tab after event, but always pop up after checking possum vendor machine.

If I'm remembering correct it's close to watoga

---
Same too with using your pipboy while seated.
---
Ok idk what time zone your in so just msg me when your ready
---
I’m sure bethesda wants to keep the rate that players earn free atoms at a very specific level and they will game the system in whatever way they need to in order to do that. 
---
This is the only reason the game is going to have free content. They need to regulate the system and try to guarantee a certain amount of actual dollars spent. Maybe there is a better way that they can limit free atoms that is less annoying for gamers.
---
Not talking about your latest, but in other comments you keep saying that "lately" you've been positive about 76. Define lately. Cause in April alone you made at least 4 videos calling fo76 bad.
---
Anti armor anything is expensive and powerful.
---
Never had three, but I did have two on my first run. That’s nuts.

Welp if they do do Battle Royale, Add another Lie to bethesdas Record. Been reading articles from last year that they confirmed they wouldnt add Battle Royal nor have any Battle Royal 's  in Development.

While it doesn't always work, you *can* place down the stored blueprints.

It’s not that bad, I got mine on a level 27 who had never discovered a location in the mire beforehand. Took me about 4 hours without the ability to fast travel around as freely.
---
Same.
---
Dude it happens. People get stupid over the weirdest shit.
---
Thanks. Gonna try this.
---
Duping and overpricing.
---
So would Anti Armor be better than Two Shot on a Lever?
---
I refuse to even do them, such boring mundane tasks.
---
Add me.
---
* **xSlack_Jaws_420x**
---
Lol no worries :)
---
I'm on now.
---
I still look around but only if nearby. Not going to spend the caps to find nothing I want or everything overpriced.
---
I have same problem &amp; mine is right next to a station.
---
Very possible with a bloodied build.
---
Get max strength, all unyielding armor, nerd rage, and your switchblade should be doing maybe 500-600 damage, increase that with bloody mess (? I think it’s called) and get 6 gladiator points for an extra 40% to damage and you got probably a 1000 hit switch blade no doubt
---
Are mutations going to be available?
---
Kinda kinky but ok
---
I went with the I'm not in any particular rush to get them all done as soon as possible so I'm going to work on them one at a time while not even thinking about what the other badges need method.
---
Zulu38 IGN logging in now
---
Yup! Just about every camp I visit is selling serums from 800 to 3000 caps and junk weapons and armor for crazy high prices. Someone was selling inert flux for 55c a piece...lmao!
---
Where did you find all of those unyielding BOS pieces? Looks like a nice set.
---
Oh shit ur pc I’m Xbox
---
Unyielding is still top but some people dont like playing low health so they prefer other types of armor
---
I've tried Bolstering. Bought an entire outfit but went back to unyileding. I like those extra perk points. Tried mixing and matching and I didn't see much difference.
---
No man ,thanks though
---
Yes I check the vending machine each time I do event
---
Yes definitely
---
Cool!
---
Thanks- done!
---
There’s a perk for that
---
yea it’s also part of the free range event
---
Realistically what did you expect? 
---
Shiny new thing is no longer shiny. 
---
The only thing really worth buying are low priced serums, junk, ammo,  and rare plans.
---
However,  95% of every camp I've traveled to has everything priced way higher than I would spend caps on (5000 caps for an anti-armor knife.... really? Atomic Rollerball 25,000)
---
No one is buying your overpriced stuff guys lol
---
EDIT: Also,  if your camp is on the outer edges of the map,  I'm not paying to fast travel there.
---
Even playing half health with all them sweet stacked stat bonuses saves on ammo.
---
It's great cause of how big the place is but it still feels a bit like a [Patchwork Map](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchworkMap) at times, almost like a set of Minecraft biomes, but that doesn't really make it bad. Just a bit like a theme park or something, odd to have so many "themed" areas in close proximity like that.
---
Still my favorite map of all of them, though I'm still hoping to get a snowy place or something in the next main game - Appalachia is great because it's not the same "nuked desert" or "nuked city" biomes as the rest of the main games and their DLC have featured (excluding Point Lookout and Far Harbor). Appalachia has a completely different environment, and it's a super refreshing break. But I still want to see someplace like Alaska where it's not perpetual summer.
---
Or just someone who wanted a cool camp and logged out without checking if someone was browsing
---
Everyone’s holding their breath.
---
How many have you got stored, maybe from where your camp got picked up and moved?
---
You can't use vats at long range. That's why I used the wording that I did. You should have known that already before leaving a useless comment.
---
Yes, when you level up you can move one special stat to a different one or spend it on a new perk. It’s kinda whack
---
Yeah, I mean if it’s something expensive that they’re trying to sell then they’ll probably be happy to tell you
---
I like to split between vanguard and unyielding. It may seem counter intuitive but you get bonuses even if you've lost only a little health and the extra damage resistence can save your life
---
Geez.  I have a 3 star assassins black powder for 750.
---
Thanks guys.  Maybe  we will get a quest added in for this.  Can the paint only be applied to t51?
---
I agree ^ that's why I sell my things very cheap even my legendaries. because they can be use for scripts ..
---
It's a pretty cool respecing system and I'm really glad they added it to the game.
---
I assume it's less of an issue in price and more of them just not being practical so no one wants them. I just sell them to vendor bots now.
---
Buddy you are inarguably much better at this game than I am. That’s impressive. (Definitely also have a case of shiny object syndrome, I don’t find these tasks particularly fun so I’m constantly getting distracted.)
---
That sucks.
---
I wish I could find one of the damn things, I need a picture for my herpetologist badge.
---
With that being said, I definitely don't wanna fight 'em. High-level Mirelurk types get *crazy* with the poison damage.
---
My total is pretty low too. I maxed out the first 2 days off of the stuff I'd been saving, but its been pretty light since. Just not getting legendries at a decent rate. I even did a solo white springs run today where I cleared out the golf club and all the side buildings and only got a single 1* out of it.
---
Anyone here the refrigerator mod and want to swap for the carry weight?
---
Yes please! We need a sorry emote. The amount of times I’ve pissed someone of because I’ve vomited instead of hearted at them for something nice they did
---
Yeah even my 3* stuff hardly goes in the machine at more than 750 caps.  I've had great success getting caps the past few days.  I've been able to purchase 3 different serum recipes and sell the serums themselves for 300 caps.
---
Oh believe me shiny object syndrome is my entire existence. I spend most of my time collecting Knick-knacks for my CAMP and these new dailies don’t help that one bit with all the additional mounted animals.
---
Don't sign off lol. Just leave your game on with an analog stick stuck in the direction of a corner in your camp. It'd only last till the server dies or crashes but adds exposure time to your items they otherwise wouldn't get.
---
Go for the swimmer, athlete and archery badges they’re by far the easiest to complete
---
Around the BOS fire bases they seem start for me
---
Congrats to you
---
How about Berry Mentats and good aim?
---
I'm here for you signing on right now. Will you be there for me? Tag -shlergen I have no mic
---
It would be way better if every 5 levels you could completely respect all special instead

How about just use stealth boys as well?

If people see lots of different things available on the map icon, they’ll check it out. If you’re near things they’re doing, they’ll stop by. Can’t speak to your inventory, but there isn’t really anything going on at Whitespring right now so location could be a factor.
---
Only after you've actually found the camera off the body first.
---
Really? I didn’t know that. I’ve tried doezens of times, but it always says “needs support”

Better yet; if you were never placed into a world where your camp spot is occupied and you only see that message if, say... you're joining a friend's server and your camp can't be placed.
---
Yes these have been weekly updates but they are part of an already planned road map. There was nothing planned for tomorrow, it is not just a weekly Tuesday update. Also, the purveyor even coming on Thursday is earlier than it was suppose to be.
---
I'd absolutely love to sell nukas out of my vending machine, I'd actually move it out of the garage and next to the visitor area if that was the case.

More at the end of the month iirc

The irony is when Google searching fallout76 reddit this thread came back as a top result with the header "I can't take fallout 76"

Ahh I thought and assumed as much. Thanks~

No problem, trust me the added carry weight from the backpack is definitely worth the time investment.
---
I was selling ** Heavy combat armor for in game prices,even unyielding.pieces &amp; not many takers, so I scrapped them all. I normally travel to all with higher armor pieces for sale when I join a world as I am only looking for 2 decent unyielding arms,, but only.picked up one decent piece.
---
Some people are still selling serums for 200, but most are asking stupid prices
---
Fortnite bad, minecraft good

Agreed

Got that perk at under level 10, took until level 50ish to realize. Bummed I missed so much honestly.
---
they could’ve at least added other trumpet tunes, it’s not 0600 every 30 seconds
---
They spawn now in case folks ditch the camera and want to remake it later.
---
Damn! That’s how cap collector works!? Seriously?
---
If you're on PC, I'll buy those gears.  😉
---
These are totally getting out of hand, and if you remember that 10 atoms is basically 10 cents, I have literally NO REASON to jump through these flaming hoops.  I understand they want us to buy atom packs, but you don't get us to open our wallets by insulting us like this. We pay when we feel we are being well taken care of.  These challenges were suppose to be a fun trickle of currently that adds up over time, not make us feel like underpaid child laborers in a third world country.
---
It's okay to have some specifics, like "Take a picture of a Radstag." That's not unreasonable, you do have to make a goal of it, it's totally worth 10 cents.  But suddenly you add "In a radstorm/nukezone" and your asking me to just get lucky or server hop and also get lucky for a DIME!!
---
On the other hand, some of the early challenges were really boring or dumb. "Collect 10 wood" BORING! "Collect 100 water" BORING AND TEDIOUS!  These daily challenges should be fun and encourage moments of discovery or exploration, not based on luck or requiring hours of game-time for the equivalent of the spare change I can find between my couch cushions!
---
Fair enough
---
So you don't have to put any real work in to change your build? There should not be the abilty for you to go from shitty food build to god build in a few hours of play.  I would hate the respecting system if it was any way other than what it is.
---
Took me all night to come up with. Just hope someone at Bethesda hears me.
---
30 hops and counting... spawns on lighthouse = 0
---
Oh fuck
---
that's what I call a terrible merchant. No one force us to be merchants in this game, but if we take that route, we have to think a little about customers.
---
That and it's been taking longer for world items to spawn in, not just when first booting the game vut also everytime I fast travel. I'm also on Xbox One too.
---
Wait a second... 
---
You’re saying that 2 out of 3 times you move, you can actually place it??

That’s awesome!! I wish I was you.

Shit I'm out here to catch bodies, eventually someone's gonna get me, no hard feelings lmao

That's not it. I want my camp to be there even when I'm not.
---
Would you be upset to know that my friend got the full set in 4 events
---
Yes but are they cazodores tough??
---
And that is the biggest shame of all - I love the look of the standard barrel on the .50 but I can't turn down the bonus damage from the heavy barrel.
---
WOOSH!!

This was great. The one with the owl had me dying though:] I subscribed
---
Yes, sometimes things are different from one game to another.  In Fallout 3 we had skills and earned perks every level, in New Vegas we got perks every other level (also, by the way, in NV we had consumable magazines - so it's not \*that\* incongruous), in Fallout 4 we didn't have minimum levels to get the first rank of a perk.  
---
I think it makes perfect sense for them to be collectibles and consumables (again, magazines were consumables in New Vegas anyways).  
---
This game is very different from previous games: we can "respec" our character at any time with changing the cards we have selected, legendary weapons can roll with up to 3 pre-fixes compared to FO4 where they could only have one, 
---
And they are great, why bother with them?  Perk magazines last for 30 minutes and bobbleheads for 1 hour, if you have the curator perk they last for 60 minutes and 2 hours respectively.  You think that +25% unarmed damage or  getting 30% more healing from stimpacks for 1-2 hours is trash? Getting an additional 15% Melee damage for 30/60 minutes is trash?
---
I'm sorry, I disagree.  They are useful, and can augment builds, even if it's not a permanent augment. Pop it before jumping into a fight with the SBQ/Sheepsquach or before you jump into a dungeon. 
---
People aren't buying them because a.) they aren't that hard to come by, b.) my observation people are way overcharging for them c.) You don't need them, just like you don't need most chems.  
---
Making them permanent wouldn't change people buying them. Sure, maybe at first as people try to finish their sets, but once you have the ones you want it would be permanent and sales would end. The "Best" ones might be the only ones that sell and their prices would be outrageous. People would be server hopping trying to find them, people would be trying to dupe them to sell. They would all have to be reworked, perks would need to be changed, and content would have to be balanced. 
---
That's a lot of work (and rework) because nostalgia dictates that these items should be permanent.  Why not just enjoy them for what they are and the fact that the game - being just like the last 3, is doing something different from what it's predecessor did?
---
Just don't join party's with people, chances are they can't get anything on you just from ingame.

Eh, speak for yourself, I found the Pack to be a perfectly acceptable faction in the context of Nuka World. A robot-only Raider faction would have been pretty cool, though.
---
But how would you lose it? Either way that’s too much. They’re cheap as chips anyway. Sell a few stims in a vending machine and you’re good to go.
---
Crashes, disconnects and bugs like being unable to respawn are what need to be fixed. There’s no excuse for any of those things in a fully released game. The workshop system itself is fine.

Definitely need to give things a couple tries. I tried the photography badge yesterday morning. The camera and film parts went fine, but I went through a couple rolls of film trying to get the pictures and couldn't make any progress. Played again later on and they all worked on the first try.
---
I would like it to be like the minecraft battle royale mode! And it would be nice if you kept your build and your character but that's it.
---
When did they there hasn’t been an update and servers haven’t come down
---
EDIT: You are correct I’m sorry.
---
Yes at level 50.
---
Just sneak. Lol
---
Not only is it incongruous, it’s inconvenient. I don’t often get to plan my encounters well enough to use any magazines or bobble heads. Only small guns bobble head and a magazine that got me a 50% chance to get more flora that I used going into a nuke zone. The rest of them? Fat chance I’ll encounter some of this stuff within an hour of using it, and I can’t hot key it to use it on the fly. Oh, extra damage to Mirelurks? Well if I happen to have that magazine in me, and if I remember that fact, I guess I could pop it before I engage a Mirelurk queen. But any other scenario? Useless. I’d be better off shooting in a fight than navigating a menu to try to use these things. 
---
I like the option of having to choose one and have it equipped. Can’t use more than one, but also don’t have to fuck with remembering which bobble head/magazine you have out of 30+ possibilities. 
---
The Witcher series had similar functioning gear; potions you would pop right before a fight that would make you much better at that particular engagement. But there were only 6 so it was a lot easier to manage, and you chose one to go in a special slot that was hotkeyed. 
---
tl;dr: they are too hard to manage as is. OP’s suggestion simplifies life and makes them more valuable even if they have to be nerfed to make it work.
---
for what making a joke? 🤣
---
its not my fault you didn't get it.
---
Loot yes xp no. No one should be rewarded for not participating. This would open the door to afk farming for multiboxers. Non tagged loot rewards is bad enough. Great idea that would be instantly abused.
---
It varies :P sometimes I have a decent streak. I just finished updating my floating base, went to move it, annnnd we're starting over. Again. Last two versions of my camp haven't moved successfully.
---
Fortnight is the best game I've never played.  See, since all the kids are playing Fortnight, all the other online game communities are just so much nicer.  It's like a giant online daycare and I love it for that.
---
Adding, thx! vdub580
---
Love the idea and can be done I’m sure. I could be useful to boost on specific stat like strength or agility. I would give karma but i don’t know how it works.👍
---
Same here. I haven't found not one!!
---
Your camp would be there longer than you're around but I understand what you mean.
---
lol
---
Dude, if your dick is 4 inches and bloody you should probably seek medical attention.
---
4 inches is 10.16 cm
---
If you’re on xbox I won’t do anything because I’m poor
---
It was a hotfix
---
Oh snap, forgot that place was absolutely infested with the crabby bastards. Thanks for the tip
---
Miner cannot be completed for me, the photos of the minerals does not count.
---
It's not just to ruin your game session, I do it for junk, higher level players for junk and caps.
---
However since the most recent patch it doesn't even pay off that much more to Target high levels so everyone is on the table. When I've had a low level player drop 400 acid, there's definitely a reason to continue.
---
Thank you so much!!!!!
---
Servers did go down and yes they did fix it.
---
Same, except I'm a Explosives Sniper... who carries a +25% fr AA 10mm SMG with quick reload magazine to tag them all.

3 days ago.

---
Still wanna just pay shipping?
---
That would be awesome to do - it obviously wouldn't be anywhere near the depth offered in Arma or DayZ for engine reasons, and we've already been told "no vehicles" anyway, but I can dream.
---
We all know you were trying to leave a cheeky comment but got it wrong since you don't know how V.A.T.S. works, then you double down by saying it's a joke. Oof dude go home
---
Yeah it brings me up to excavator levels
---
I miss the simple "level up" challenge.
---
Now you have to level up 3 times while doing something special.
---
I'm lucky if can level up once a day at my level.
---
But yeah, they clearly made these harder so people buy atoms.
---
Awesome lol. Especially the poster in back haha
---
It’s not like it’s preventing people from building whacky floating houses.
---
I go to bed with the shop open and have my controller braced up to keep it moving.
---
That would break immersion! Surely humans can't look at there wrists while sitting
---
Awesome thanks!
---
He spawns s at the defend events so the farms and hemlock holes are good because he spawns right by the road.
---
Still though super silly challenge unnecessarily hard.
---
i like power armor and all but it’s just so bulky walking around in it sometimes, this backpack is a game changer
---
That's partially the reason I started treating my camp more like a static settlement than an actual mobile camp. I get that it was *designed* to be moved but the constant weirdness with blueprints doesn't exactly encourage its intended use.
---
I found the camera by going to the Colonel Kelly memorial and server hopping. My friend did the same thing and it took us each about 20 minutes. It's not ideal but it's by far the easiest way to find it.
---
I found a combat knife version with the same stats. It's fun tonplay around with, even specced for rifles.
---
Okay I'm home so so sorry about the wait also I'm on pst
---
I visit every camp on the map and usually buy at least something even if it’s something cheap just for the fact I’m walking into your camp. The problem I see here is the fact that some of the weapons / armor that are on the higher end of prices we can’t view what the other 2 perks are if they are 2* or 3* if the owner isn’t standing right there. I have weapons and armor that would normally on Reddit sell for 10k listed under 5k and some way under but who will buy it if they can’t view the whole set of perks. I won’t! I try to fast travel back to my camp if I see a player there but most times I miss them. Can’t wait for that to be fixed cause I have no problem paying up for something worth it.
---
But you can build the stairs under the roof. It’s cray, but you have to build two flight of stairs up, the real one and a “service” set. Build to the top, delete the real stairs. You can do this because the top floor is still grounded. Build everything else you can, roofs, walls, all the other crap that won’t work over stairs for no good reason. Then build the real stairs back in, starting from the top and working your way down. Delete the services stairs. Stupid but it works.
---
Minecraft is a good time, Fallout would  be wise to mirror that aspect, I agree.
---
Just few minutes ago I accidentally one shotted a lvl 5 legendary ghouls. I had just teamed up with a random guy and he did loot the legendary enemy without hitting it. 
---
Don’t know about xp tho, but I’m pretty sure drops go squad-wise
---
Just came too say I also love the poster. ~tips hat
---
I just hopped around looking at vendors and milked every strange Brahmin  I met. 
---
Sure, you probably shouldn’t go molesting other peoples Brahmin, but all’s fair in war and merit badges.
---
That is a very good point. Some of them get out though
---
It may be the too many friends problem
---
Have they patched the lever action rifle in fallout 4 yet? That was a nightmare on survival.
---
dude, i have over 300 hours in fo76 and i've played all of the previous bethesda fallout games. i'm pretty sure i know how vats works.
---
i was making a joke about how vats is literal aimbot and how some people play the game without ever firing their own weapon manually.
---
you need to chill out and stop being salty about a joke.
---
So people aren't supposed to get in the server because you want to sell afk?
---
Inventories compromise stability, it's the reason why it took 6mos to get up to 800 in our stashes. So you and your camp and your inventory are going to just sit there and add to the games instability?
---
Yeah you make a good point indeed...
---
But hey. Let’s all welcome the new players with This awesome add on!
---
It’s usually just junk no one wants. I’ll just buy cheap 3* items to scrap for scrip. Many of the players are not on Reddit so they don’t know the prices sentinel and cavalier armors are worth. They see a cheap 3k on a sentinel piece and are immediately turned off. But the same goes for lower levels who put them up for cheap. Yeah there are not very many vendors out there. Wasn’t as good as everyone thought.
---
Ona side note. Serums still sell and at a steady rate.
---
Its hard feeling my way around a video game
---
Yes. Every time you level up past 50 you're offered a choice between getting a new perk card *or* "respeccing" one of your Special points. It's a bit slow going but it's better than nothing.
---
My first priority is the company stop dupers (in-game and eBay), griefers, mod-cheaters….
---
Not showing that option, so I marked the bug things.
---
Normal, they are still wondering what to do with PVP, the biggest cancer of this game from day 1. They had to isolate PVP, I guess the number of players in PVP must be ridic...
---
As far as I know this is still accurate.

Massive thanks!
---
i loved the capital wasteland just cause of the history and the real places they used, the colors were bad tho. appalachia is the prettiest
---
So you enjoy hours of grinding to do a simple respec? And by real work you mean 30+ hours of straight grinding for xp to change your stats? You’re alone my friend.  What I’m proposing would take 5 hours instead. Sorry you have a problem with convenience.  Bethesda mole
---
I would love a Fallout game in Florida or Alaska. I’m honestly imagining a gator creature similar to a death claw or sheepsquatch
---
Also if you can I'm doing campfire tales rn
---
I'm dieing 😂😂 you are an artist.
---
Slow, less slow, and not slow!
---
All of them
---
not anymore
---
Remind me again how vats works at max range? You know exactly what I said and you thought you could make a joke. Except you don't know how the game works so neither does your joke. Again, why don't you just scoot back over to the battlefield subreddit you normally hang out in.
---
Have your tried to use that in PVP lol
---
It is pretty cool but there isn't any reason to go there anymore.
---
I'm level 147, if you don't mind me spawning higher-level enemies you're welcome to add me. I have a mic but no discord. vdub580
---
What would your thoughts be if someone actually bought one of those.
---
I just came back to the game after hearing all the positive stuff recently
---
Totally agree. and If I have to hunt your machines I wont come back or buy anything.
---
I mean yeah its your camp, do what you want. Just dont expect my camps is I have to hunt for your machine. 
---
I spent good caps to get there. Cater to your customers is a pretty basic business rule.
---
You do realize they dont spawn in the same place you spawn?
---
Asshole? Not pickin up what you're layin down there but yeah, the artillery is definitely underwhelming...
---
I didn't realize this was the case. I have been using a prime AA ffr plasma Gatling on the queen and all of the yellowflux I put into the cores. Sad day.
---
Have a look at  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnw5s2/anyone\_getting\_deathclaw\_hides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnw5s2/anyone_getting_deathclaw_hides/)

Seems containers are the only place
---
Good. Because you can complete the main quest and all non-dlc quests solo, and I have.
---
EDIT: and there's only one mandatory part of the scout stuff that requires someone else and one optional part (swimming badge)
---
No problem!
---
i got a full set but they are only 1\*, arms and torso the same armor, and the  legs are the same 2 armor. i switch out one of the legs for a chameleon one most of the time tho. its great for melee for all that str
---
I tried to join a SBQ fight the other day and 50% of the environment and mobs didn’t load up for the entire 10 minutes I was standing there. My PC is a monster. 
---
I’m not saying your idea is bad, but it seems to be completely un-implementable. The game barely works as-is, changing the entire environment might make that worse. Unless it got rid of a huge portion of things it would otherwise have to render, and just loaded up new textures. I want to be able to see the SBQ first, everything else is just aesthetics and I couldn’t care less.
---
Congrats!  What system r u on?  I’d like to come see a real non-duped tse!
---
It is a survival game grinding is a literal aspect of the game. Yes it is what I and other people who play survival games enjoy.
---
A bit late to this post, but yeah. I feel like this "feature" is holding the economy back. Either people have to sit in their camps to help buyers see item details, killing their time - or sellers leave their camp, and buyers don't buy, because they don't know what they're buying.
---
Xbox. It’s a one of a kind lol

those 3 speeds are

That one was pretty rough to read, and, like was previously mentioned, the holotape of the mother and her baby :-/
---
Also, what's up with the little concrete buildings that are cleary access points to an underground..something? They're all collapsed; no way to get down there?
---
It might be true at your camp. but after 100s of camps, you definitely don't spawn near the vending machine.
---
It’s my first too
---
You might want to lay off the caffeinated sugary drinks.
---
Bro, hop servers.
---
Looking forward to that full set of epic wood armor and pimped-out drill
---
Sorry, at work so I cant actively discuss, but I'll give my rebuttal when I can and you bring up some good points. But the purpose of my initial post was to defend my statement while also giving it. But what I'm saying is, the bonuses that PA provides is not adequate to illicit this content solely being available to regular armor.

Still here.

I mean yeah, its their camp they can do what they want, but I spent caps to get there and I will not return visit or even buy anything if I have to easter egg hunt their machines. It just sales 101. Don't put the customer out when they are tyring to spend money on your wares.
---
Had to server hop just to buy enough legendary gear for scrip. Not much of that cheap stuff left. Did see a tse shotty for 17k
---
1. i have just as much right to be in the subreddit for a game i play regularly as you do.
---
2. my joke was about vats itself not the specific implementation in fallout 76, i am perfectly aware there is a maximum range for it and you can lay off with the attitude.
---
Monster rage

Fingers crossed it’s just a variant and one will be provided in game
---
Far too often I’ve been sitting on my couch in long johns, singing along to country roads, eating dog food and in barges some stranger to start rooting through my shit, giving me dirty looks. Hooligans.
---
Nah man. There’s a footlocker and craft table outside out, use em and move along.
---
UPDATE: found a store that was clearing stock and was selling the Tricentennial edition brand new for just around $15! (after converting from my currency). Bargain!
---
See ya’ll in West Virginia!
---
Can be on here and there over the next few days. I'll join you if you're on. You don't have to go out of your way to join me.

Btw. Where are you located? Most my characters are encumbered. If I can know your location I can join when I'm in the area.
---
Rats. I’m ps4. It’s immensely cool though!
---
LOL I love the jaguar run thing they do crossing a mile in a second.  With speed demon and marsupial I couldn't get away. 
---
Those things terrify me badly.

I agree PPL just suck
---
There's an exam terminal in one of the huts where the Campfire Tales event spawns.  I plan on doing the rest of mine there so I don't have to hear that annoying bugle any more.

Ditto, pc, couldn’t get any of the instruments in Nukashine to work. Gave up but it looks like reliving might help?
---
You really don't like getting called out for shitposting huh?
---
I’ve never moved since level 40 and I’m 208 now. I like my spot and don’t think I’ll ever move lol.
---
Ever notice the dates and entries on the maintenance computer? If I remember correctly there's an entry way after everyone was booted to the curb saying something about finally over riding the lockout? Who dis that entry?
---
My download was 60gb
---
just curious, what are you asking for it?
---
Same
---
i stumbled in there today and got lost.
---
Me too. Was one of the reasons I posted; to see how kuch I've missed so far lol
---
they need to fix the legendary inspecting at player vending otherwise most people arent gonna be selling their decent legendarys and they will think no one wants it and scrip it because 1-2 of the effects could be AMAZING for someone but they cant see them(unless the player is at their camp).
---
this is the biggest reason people cant sell their 2-3\* legendarys.
---
What platform?
---
I have been stuck in so many, the owner is obliviously standing in front of me waving and stuff. lol Because I am stuck but on the outside of the block. But stuck none the less.
---
I didn’t think it was possible. Well I knew it was possible but didn’t think it would ever happen. Too bad it doesn’t fit my build I had to buy
---
I’d like to see something like this, but having all of the player vendors in one room in the white spring hotel. Remove all of the work benches in the big room and allow one vendor per player to be there. It would limit what you could sell there but people who have camps on the ash heap or toxic valley might get some more exposure. Idk. Just a thought.
---
you really don't like it when jokes go over your head.
---
What kills me is the level up 3 times.
---
Look here Bethesda, I work 40+ hours per week, I ain't got the time to play long enough IN ONE DAY to do that.  I'm lucky to get in five hours during the week.  
---
And yes, the other challenges are absurd.
---
I know it looks kinda dorky, but use the floating build method: 1 concrete block foundation on the bottom and then add stairs going up, build upper floors off said stairs and continue to build the rest of your camp in the air. That way when you go to move, you only need to find a place big enough for the 1 concrete foundation instead of the whole floor. You can pretty much place your camp anywhere at that point.
---
Yep. I try to keep my prices low so new people can afford some necessities.
---
Hey what is your gt and what are u asking for it lol
---
lmao, i was doing the same thing. Got up to about 20 of them and then just sold them in my soda, comic, candy machine.
---
You don't happen to have two cameras in your inventory, do you?
---
If you have two only one will count for photos.
---
Yeah, Fallout is good in large part because it often hits a little too close to home..
---
Fair enough. I’ve personally never been a grinding fan
---
Awesome.
---
No they didn't, still occurring, look out for multiple people inside whitesprings
---
It’s in my vendor for 2.5k. GT BLUBLZRedeux. I’m on now just watching Game of Thrones and letting it run while I’m away.
---
Yeah with large structures and complicated structures the game has trouble with them.
---
And if you have light/paintings/wires/work benches or anything clipping into walls, it can cause the game to not want to place it.
---
With smaller less complicated pieces it does a little better.
---
The system is flawed to be sure and I've had better chances just rebuilding from zero, but it has worked for me once or twice.
---
And they have recently updated the games building rules so be sure to check out the recent patch notes.
---
And as much as i hate it for aesthetic reasons the one foundation floating stair house works wonderfully with the system as it works now.

Is it duped or is Aluminum easy to get and Im just bad?
---
Wait!  The big question is where did it drop?
---
What part of the joke did I miss? The part where you joke about me thinking vats is an aimbot since you don't know vats can't be used at max range? Or the part where you jumped into an old thread to shitpost and have a tantrum when called out?
---
I’m sitting at my camp so you can see the stats
---
Yeah, I’m on my second character now and I’m loving it.
---
damn, PC here.
---
I watched the latest episode this morning, enjoy!
---
That’s the way man
---
Xbox guess that's important lol
---
I miss my fully loaded out pool table from FO4. It would be cool to have some of these objects work like the musical instruments: activate it and you do a little cutscene of using the object if there’s appropriate space for it. Pool tables, dart boards, put in some exercise equipment, bath tubs and (maybe) toilets, TABLES AND BOARD GAMES OMG THERES SO MANY BOARD GAMES.
---
I did this in my first vendor, was not thinking at all. I wondered why one guy came up and started engaging me for no reason. Worst of all, i dropped some salt for him, not realizing why he was upset
---
Honestly, it’s nice not getting suicided anymore but I put mine in my stash. It’s still very powerful but I’m having a lot of fun with a couple handmade drops I got.
---
Yeah. The first time it happened to be there after I logged out from the night before. Twice I actually had to walk place to place before finding it there and lastly I was smart enough to find it in a friend's server so I was able to rejoin with it still there.
---
I’m level 90 and I still jump...
---
Absolutely
---
They’ve always been this tough I thought. By far the most dangerous creature in the game. A merc-machine!
---
If you ask me, the worst F4 DLC, still has more content/ quality or new mechanics involved than all F76 free DLCs...
---
I prefer not to talk about the bugs, because I still find the worst ones I experienced.
---
The only good thing I can talk about would be the increased stash limit.
---
The the first camera I ever picked up. I've never found a second. It worked for 2 ores prior to the most recent maintenance, now it doesn't work.
---
Believe it or not I have no idea until I got back to my camp. I usually only do WS, WesTek, Steakhouse and whatever events pop up. I’m thinking it was the Steakhouse but I did to the Robo place near there that has a legendary gutsy. One of those places for sure
---
My four go to weapons now are a junkies explosive handmade, an instigating handmade, the fixer and a bloodied explosive LMG for the queens and sheepsquatches.
---
Edit. I run a max sneak build day to day so with my perks the fixer hits really hard (375 - 525) as does the instigating handmade. If I find an anti-armor handmade I’ll run that most likely.
---
I’m done with tadpole and have not heard that play a single time. 
---
It’s crazy how differently this game is experienced by so many people.
---
It’s in my vendor for 2.5k GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
You need to post this in a trading subreddit.
---
Ur appearing offline I’ll msg ur gt. Thanks!
---
Which videos?
---
They fixed this with the recent patch. If the sheepsquatch is visible upon death, the body will be as well.
---
What time do they reset? Thought it wasn't until tomorrow.. just lost my card trying what I guess was last week's code :(
---
i have a furious(maybe even a bloodied one too) one i think but i dont think they fixed them to the point where you can just hold down attack, you have to tap attack, do damage, let go, repeat in order for the legendary effects to work. 
---
anyone know if they actually fixed that nonsense yet?
---
I wasn't making a joke about you thinking vats is aimbot, i was making a joke about vats BEING aimbot.
---
you click a button and the game aims for you, literally the textbook description of aimbot.
---
Im seriously starting to wonder if your a troll or just that dumb.
---
you can keep calling me a shitposter all you like, it doesn't change the fact i made a joke you still don't comprehend.
---
Oh, about 80 or so.  I'll buy them, but if you can point me to good farming spots, I'll do that too.
---
One shot and swap
---
Sure you already know this, but from one classic Fallout hoarder to another, check out the value of your junk and SELL IT. Get RICH buddy. I top ten thousand caps in an hour doing that, and most importantly, I can shed my excess without my Fallout hoarder's OCD bothering me lol
---
I thought that too at first.  But then I discovered the level up 3 times is actually only level up once meeting three criteria.
---
I play this game every so often... but what the hell are you guys talking about..? haha
---
You can meet all three requirements in one level up....
---
So tappping is how to use them?
---
You just don't get it
---
Setting wise I would say it’s one of my favorites.
---
I mean, you don't have to do them...
---
Sorry someone just grabbed it. Not sure how to fix that online thing. Sorry
---
actually for me what is awesome its to say things like "we want players to make their story" and then "forget" totally about any way for passive trade on a huge map populated by a max of 20 players...
---
90% of the free content smells just too much like ripped content of the original basegame...
---
Cant Wait for the C.H.A.T. (Cibernetic Head Antrophomorphic Transmiter) to be able to speak through text with other liveforms!
---
he says.
---
once again woosh!
---
WAIT WAIT WAIT A FUCKING SECOND HERE....Are you telling me THAT is the reason why I enter areas and watch everything drop dead without firing a fucking shot?! I thought it was just another bug or something lol GOOD INFO MAN!
---
That’s okay man it was actually me (: thank you!!
---
They are a pain in the ass to me without the legemdary
---
lol, oh well, understable… I've been a merchant in rl before many of the players around here were born… so , game or not, when I set up for sales. the customer is my first priority, then the second priority is the customer too.
---
IMO durability should be their major upside. Damage might be low but there’s very few moving parts and friction compared to ballistic, so it almost never breaks down. Ammo should be tough to make but either be super light or come in massive quantities per build. 
---
One way or another laser weapons need to be redone. Shotgun perks need to apply. Intelligence needs to up damage. Durability needs to be looked at. Any combination thereof.
---
if they have those kinds of legendary effects. but i havent read all the patch notes since febuary so i dont know if they fixed them from that method or if you still have to do that.
---
Just give full exp of you're in a group and dont tag a mob. Diablo 3 does this its not that big of a deal.
---
Well there ya go. Have fun with my only ever TSE drop lol
---
I’m still tearing through these Doubleshot explosive handmade losers with my combat knife, so I’m not even sure if there is meta right now. Stab stab stab
---
Haha I haven’t gotten one from a drop yet it will go to good use!
---
Glad it went to a good home
---
I think anything bloody since that’s all I see lol
---
Yes. Give me karma now
---
I'm in.  DRIVEINKILLER
---
Two Shot is the name of the prefix. but yes i agree. TSE is nowhere near as good as it used to be. now its all about that bloodied build.
---
I got the last of my 8 badges for the hi-cap backpack just tonight.  Granted, I've been farming it nonstop since the beginning...still faster than the other way ;-)
---
Cool thanks for confirming
---
Depends on your play style. Guys with glass cannon builds with bloodied hammer fists are doing 1800 damage a hit. Course they are dead if they get touched. 
---
I’m level 220 something and I honestly think no power armor sneak builds are the deadliest. I run a full set of sentinel armor and my weapons hit hard as fuck.
---
See, I wish they would let you booby trap your base now
---
Yes
---
Since I am usually the tank on SBQ fights, your point is moot.
---
Ah! You guys are awesome! I didn't even know this was a thing!
---
I love the Appalachia setting. I would really like to see fallout content set in a New Orleans/Texas map or a south GA okefenokee and Florida map.
---
Haven't seen this one yet. Thank You!
---
IEATASS
---
Depends on what frustrated you enough to stop playing.

Just found a little camp along the north western edge of the mountain in the Savage Divide. Two person camp where the inhabitants, (a woman and a soldier) were using homemade rope and lumber, "elevators" to get up to the safety of their camp. You can find them at the bottom of the cliffs. Rope broke...:`-(
---
Stealth. It’s very powerful.

I was pleasantly surprised when I did an event and found this out, promptly finished the rest of the challenge and unlocked my first backpack mod!
---
i got a lot of vanguard and bolstering armour for sale in my shop but doesnt seem to sell very quick atm.
---
so i would say unyeilding as its what i use :).

You're right except for legendary items. Your teammates still need to tag the enemy.

Lettuce pray.

---
Haven'y seen thus one yet. Thank you for the tip. Going hunting for it tonight!
---
The hilarious part is that simply picking up wet kindling spawns 3-4 insects per kindling.
---
Well you can’t bulk gold forks and aluminum canisters if that’s what you mean ;)
---
Stimpacks are a chem
---
I've always gone with melee. It's been good since the beginning and it's a simple build for someone like me who doesn't understand all this two-shot explosive dragon and flux ammunition stuff
---
It's not actually that different in terms of new content. A lot of it change in lighting &amp; paths block to direct you through differently.
---
Play though with a new character is great. Not a lot of changes but it feels very different. Like the story additions too.
---
I would just like to be able to remove the two ramps I laid down, after I had laid foundations and removed them, but couldn't remove the ramps because supposedly, they're dependent on one another.
---
I spent too much time building up my new camp.  I am not moving it now.
---
Just south of whitespring on the golf course.
---
Mind you, it works because the map is attempting to replicate an entire state rather than a specific area (Boston, D.C.). If Fallout 4 tried this I think it would be goofy. The humongous map goes well with the diverse biomes.
---
I’ve tested everything, It’s a red ryder bb gun melee. 😿
---
Which is so silly imo , bloodied builds are the epitome of what you would call a glass cannon right . So you have all these glass cannons bouncing around , creating these 2 second long “pvp” fights .  I just wish everyone used Melee builds :( . I kill those fools all day
---
Its easy to get in watoga
---
You made my night , my friends are still laughing
---
Sounds like they are in need of an IRS audit.
---
As much of a solo player that I am, I love the teamwork this game has brought during events and such.
---
Let me see , you’re doing gods work
---
Player vending. Aside from a few minor glitches I think they’ve really nailed it. There were so many things they could’ve done from a design/mechanics perspective to screw it up but they didn’t do any of them.
---
The Encryptid event. 
---
It spawns a legendary imposter sheepsquash that doesn’t take damage unless people activate 3 pylons that give damage over time. If you activate 1, you need to use stimpacks so you don’t die. If you activate all the pylons yourself, you need to use A LOT of stimpacks, unless you do what I do. If you die while being a conduit, it needs to be activated again to damage the sheepsquash imposter. 
---
So pretty much, you can do what most do and activate them and spam stimpacks and die, then someone will come and grab your lootbag. OR buy the chameleon and healing factor mutation, activate all of the pylons and sneak and you don’t die and no one steals your loot.
---
You are a trendsetter of the wasteland sir....now go kill the Scorchbeast!! 😁
---
My game doesn't even allow me to pick up wet kindling for some reason
---
I think people have just been using more things that drain thirst than they did when they were new players. A lot more fast travel. A lot more chem use, or other stuff like that. Either that or they're just busier not paying attention to how long they've really been doing something. There's a lot more to do in the game than before, especially with crafting and building and other "oh shit how long have I been cooking I'm starving to death" type stuff.
---
Saw the prompt to milk the wandering brahmin in flat woods but i didnt get anything... Do i need milk bottles?
---
Did you find someone? I need it too
---
Went back to my goul slayer anti armour 90% reduced weight 45
---
That would be awesome, if the game will do it. I'm on PS4. My psn is raf0485.
---
You know, lol.
---
It's great for new players. Cheaper plans. Few low level legendaries. Also handy to fast track getting into places like whitesprings with less danger.
---
GOOD!
---
Not yet. Also do you know a good spot we can jump off a cliff into shallow water?
---
As people said, you can place those blueprints, however anything biger than a 3x2 will be a nightmare to be placed.
---
Most flat place I guess is the golf area, good place to experiment with the system, so then you can expect when if the problem is ground based, or just structure/CAMP/bug issues.
---
I use to CAMP near the overseer camp, and never had too much trouble placing  with my old house (a 2x3, 2 floors compact house) + 2 aditional concrete ramps.
---
Not far from this one, in another crevasse, you can find the skeleton's if two adults, along with a single mini nuke, box of ammo,  and a hunting knife. I always picture it as two unsung hero's - local yokals who figures out what the BoS did and died trying to seal off the fissure site nearby. Hell, could be a couple thieves what got their just desserts, but I like my version better lol
---
“Yay caps”?
---
My gt is Most Dubious. Send invite. I might know a place
---
Some of the people I see with high end stealth chameleon builds do very well. It’s imo much harder of a style of play to master but it is the most powerful if done right.
---
I guess I really gotta hit that place up then, do you have any tips for gears, and screws? Thanks for your advice so far btw!
---
Yea i was thinking sniper
---
I seem to be missing out haha, but nice workaround!
---
I dont have a problem with it and i have seen it max 3 times a day
---
I'm fairly sure I read that this is something they're working on.
---
Unfortunately not really. The charleston world hereld has a few typewriters thats where i get screws thats about it. Watoga is a bit easier if you do the mayor for the day quest :)
---
I have never used them after they ducked so bad in FO4. It’s a freakin laser beam damnit! It should burn holes in sh@@ quick.
---
I warped to a radrat horde event recently. When the loading screen cleared I thought my game had bugged out, everything was blurry and I couldn't move right. Turns out I was loaded in underwater at Kerwood Mine(I believe it was). The rats were chilling out hiding in a section of submerged tunnel which is where I loaded in.
---
Yup definitely. Someone already wrote something up for that purpose. Unfortunately it hasn't been made a pinned post. So for now, i just share the link anytime i see posts asking questions

---
I would recommend fixer, people laugh at the gun but it’s pretty powerful in a stealth build.
---
I get them on a regular basis killing deathclaws(?)
---
Blegh I hate this kind of online game condescension
---
I just downvote them all. The honest answer to their questions is "Are you, the person asking, interested in playing again or buying the game? Shit or get off the pot."
---
I went with the weight one first and underestimated what impact that drop in Dr would really mean
---
Thanks for the advice!

What ammo does it use
---
.45
---
Haven't had any problems after just explaining how it works to new players.
---
Is looting teammates' kills not already a thing?
---
I was leading someone around trying to get them 50 crossbow kills the other night and the enemies were those lvl 1 communist robots. I obviously couldn't take shots at them, being level 100, so I didn't touch them. But when he killed them, I was able to loot.
---
I jist hit the join team when a guy was clearing an area i wandered into.. He went down.. I ran up stim packed him then ran back. He finished killing the enemies in the quest. Quest won. Player saved. Thumbs up emote
---
Read my post I made 10 mins ago
---
Yes.
---
Seems fair to me. I think it’s over 900 caps at vendor
---
0 in storage.
---
Thats what I thought of too but sadly none are there.
---
This is free when you hit level 25 and complete the excavator question or generally sell for around 900 caps from a vendor, so you could wait for 500 is not a bad price.
---
If you do the excavator power armor quest you learn the plan for free I believe
---
I've getting server not responding all day and before that my CAMP loaded in so slowly. I'm on the Xbox too, but this crap is pissing me off.
---
We must have stopped by the same place. I actually laughed out loud when I saw the price for inert flux. Stopped by another and they wanted 1000 caps per stable flux...... waste of caps on FT agreed.
---
Caps, not coins. This is a true free market scenario in which items are valued as to what a particular player is willing to pay. There are only rough guidelines, such as generally a purified water wont sell for hundreds of caps and nobody would sell a double shot explosive combat shotgun for 100 caps.
---
The plan for the station can be acquired from completing the excavator power armor mission, so if you don't plan on completing that mission then I guess it's worth it.
---
You get that plans for free when you complete the quest "Miner Miracles" you're right around the level to start that quest as well.
---
i guess those caps disappearing would... sort of rebalance the economy
---
From data mining, the perk and legendary effect are entirely separate and so will have multiplicative stacking. The perk stacks up to -40% with multiple players or hits, but the legendary effect is fixed at -20%.
---
Wow. My fallout hiatus has turned me ashamed. Caps. My bad
---
And of course auto correct gets me in title trouble :(

🎵 **THEY’RE OUTNUMBERED 15 TO ONE**
---
Meaning I'm not the only one who thinks their bad and am not being unreasonable
---
It depends on your play style and built. If you grind to level, then you don't really need it because you will get the plans by doing quests. If you have reached lvl 50, just hop to Watoga. Some players leave lots of plans there to grab.
---
Yeah man I can sell you 80. IGN is the same as here. 
---
I honestly just loot most everything I come across and I end up with a ton. Junk extractor doesn’t hurt.
---
On the way.. hold em for me please
---
First time I did the event it took me and some others awhile to find the missing stuff. We looked everywhere and checked our compass for the diamond shape objective. It finally spawned in so I guess it was just being buggy or lagging. At the end of the event we got the three waves and sure we were keeping up with the fire and holy moly there was a lot of bugs. We completed it but none of us got any awards from it.  We stayed there for a few minutes thinking it was just the severs catching up but never did get anything. Oh and a side note the magazine that spawns in Camp Adams is outside behind the cabin where you take the test on the terminal. Saw it there two times and I just thought it’s a weird place to spawn.
---
Why has this subreddit become so toxic
---
Apparently any plan you pick up you auto learn without actually using it.
---
So is breach and clear. You get around 50 or less lead ore, but with SD you can end up with 200+ lead scraps. Oh and those u mine it maps give free resources at the cost of caps
---
Pc
---
I offered 12k yesterday for the full plan and ended up paying 3k for borrowing fee.

If I have the plan, I will let people borrow it for free :)

Is that a bug or feature?

---
For some reason the location of "SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2" is important.
---
Bug, only occurs with the scout stuff
---
A lot of scrap is directly sellable to vendors. For what isn’t, you just bulk it and sell the bulk. 
---
As for plans and ammo, if you put them in your vending machines, they’ll sell—aside from really rarely used calibers. 
---
I sell plans at half face value and they go fast, ammo at 1 cap per bullet and it goes fast too.
---
Solo it took me 5 deaths to finally kill him as I'm running around screaming like a little girl
---
The BOS is a mod for combat armor pieces, you can buy the plans now from the vendor at Grafton train station. I got the unyielding pieces from the Scorchedbeast Queen but you have to the event a lot of times to get them. I'm still missing one piece for the full set
---
I'd upvote this more if I could.
---
If the Scout Leader bots are programmed to play reveille they should also be programmed the proper in-game time to play it (and Retreat).
---
Weird I didn't have that happen with the armored plan
---
Omg this was my issue!!!!!! Tyvm
---
He just freaked out and vanished sorry mate
---
Honestly, it just shouldn't be asked at all. I get asking people who play the game and all that, but you're basing your choice on feedback that means absolutely nothing to you. The people who are still playing are fundamentally different from you if you stopped playing and did not come back, since they enjoy the game in a different way. Just look at the fucking patch notes, there are only like one or two sets of them per month
---
This is the only part of the event that I have no idea about...what is a kindle &amp; how to pick one up? I usually just do question mark emotes from that stage :(
---
I love that idea, but wonder if we’d see a lot of bots like ESO.  I know they’re gunning for crafting resources, not XP though.
---
You should have been here around december
---
I own and operate Hrothmar's Power Armor Emporium and I empathize with your plight. I like being able to sell each part individually, but my stash limit is crippled for it. I sucked it up as the cost of running a powerarmor shop. I guess I sorta knew what I was getting myself into when I started but dang
---
I had only three people come to my camp today and yesterday I had 20+ people
---
You will get one the further you get in the game...I wouldn't buy that plan.   It's worth what you'll pay,  obviously,  but some things will be a steal,  the more you play the more you'll get a feel for what is a deal or what you may even over pay for.   You can find power armor stations to use in the world until you get to a higher level... really focus on your plan for your specials and your perks...power armor has different level requirements,  I think at 20 you can only use raider... if you have more questions keep asking... when you are at a camp, and you wonder what something is worth,  if you are looking at buying more of something you have you can look at your inventory for the in game value,  things generally go for less than that but it depends on how rare things are.   There are rare outfits that the game says are worth 17 caps,  but the drop at such a low rate after events that people (like me) are willing to spend thousands of caps on them...
---
Yeah it sometimes multiply by itself.
---
Yup that's why people are playing this game less and less
---
Bladed commie whacker berserker!!!
---
Was gone from from the game a that time,but am i wrong i thought this was a subreddit where you could literally ask anything you wanted to know as long as it fallout 76 related
---
Think your slick? I jump around you fuckers while things go explody explody explody lmao

Wow, the flaming poop bag.... not THAT brings back memories!! LOL

I’m the slickiest of slick

There are tiny sticks on the ground around the big tree in each objective area

Or you can just you know... play the game and not worry about it.. once you lvl you can be any 'build'

We need this I can't move 10mm at 1cap per round. It would give a better pricing range across the different ammo types.

I hear you. I (and my wife) raised our son differently than the guys of my generation. Kept all the good "masculine" values and just renamed them human values.

I'd be down for legendary drills tho.
---
I just don’t get why they don’t redownload it and see for themselves..
---
Some things make a return
---
Xbox
---
It is, but this kind of question is so pointless that it doesn't really belong here. Add on to the fact that in the past few weeks it's been clogging up the sub every few hours at minimum. Of course people are going to get sick of seeing it. The answer is always the same: we don't know whether you will like it, either go spend an hour trying it out or read through the patch notes and see if you like what's there
---
What mutation do you want?
---
[Oh I’m sorry, I though this was America ](https://imgur.com/gallery/TPMZ6aj)

Its purely luck based, ive stayed 4hrs in the game with 4-5 workshops with 2 friends and he never show up. I think it should be a weekly challenge not a daily.

There ya go. I have 4 kids and was raised by a successive line of independent women. I may still hold onto some latent passivity in some situations - but my son &amp; daughters seem more advanced than I am. (It’s great!)

Really? Very cool.  Thanks buddy

works ok for .308, .45, and 5.56mm, not so much for smaller rounds used in bullet hose type weapons

I have them at my vendor. Join my server. GT Muddogs09
---
I'm having this same issue. Plus I can't see other player vendors I teleport there and I don't see them and usually the 2nd floor is missing.
---
Should be easy now that they had a massive dupe going on
---
I did, I think you can't post usernames here
---
Thank you so much.
---
Ah that makes sense! Hopefully they’ll do something about it then, thanks for doing it! I really can’t wrap my mind around how they did that in the first place.
---
I just put a TSE Assault Rifle in my vendor but someone already got it. It was my first TSE drop in 208 levels.
---
Step one: acquire 3-500 caps
---
Step two: Visit CAMPs with a high number of meds in their inventory on the off chance they'll be selling cheap serums of the type you're looking for. Server hop and repeat as necessary.
---
This ain't your granddaddy's Appalachia. No need to expose yourself to godawful amounts of radiation and rolling the dice on a mutation you might not like when you can just but the discount designer serum of your choosing.
---
I have the plan. I'm planning on selling it but I'm not sure.
---
I bet you’re great at parties
---
Well currently im low on caps i have about 1500 on me.
---
who would have thought that something called challenges would be challenging.
---
First,I keep seeing the word ´´clogging`` i dont think 3 or 4 posts is ´´clogging``.Second the whole point of the question is to get different viewpoints of the game from people.Third if people are so sick of seeing it just ignore scroll past you dont have to dignify it with an answer everybody acts like as soon as they see it they have to answer it
---
Yeah, it works great, I saw someone on here mention it and I was skeptical, but it works great
---
Nobody has been banned for using mods yet, and they are pretty popular. This is what Bethesda said on the matter: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/\~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F)
---
Notice how they never mentioned that they would ban people who use mods.
---
It will trivialize leveling and people are going to start to sell power level. Now if it only works on level 50+ maybe it can work
---
I've seen this happen 3 times.
---
This explains why sometimes I could inspect and sometimes I couldn't. Thanks
---
I had 5 I didn't even know about
---
200 a piece
---
there is no money in caring..
---
there has never been a consequence for not caring.. people throw money at them anyway...
---
If it ever happens that drugs are sold infomercial-style, you'd better seize the opportunity and get yourself in front of a camera.
---
Caps translate to cents pretty well. Makes that plan $5, sure, worth it. A tse is $180, or 18000 caps. Made it easier for me at least.
---
I have a 3* rolling pin lol
---
I clicked expecting the most rad 76 video ever.

I was not let down.
---
Can you invite me ill send you a msg
---
The standard receiver did slightly more damage pre-patch too.
---
The way it works generally is that each modifier has "solo" and "dual" templates. The dual template is used when a weapon mod buffs two different params, while the solo template is used when it heavily buffs a single param.
---
The standard .50 receiver uses the solo 50cal template, while the Refined .50 receiver uses the dual 50cal template and the dual damage template. They add up to the same value numerically, but using two templates apparently suffers more from rounding.
---
If Bethesda wanted the Standard .50 receiver to deal less damage then they'd just use the dual 50cal template for it. Would make sense if the plan was a lot cheaper than the other .50 receivers.
---
Man you're one cool customer

I'd eat bobbleheads but they give me stomachaches. Magazines are not so bad tho.

I literally don't. I'm all for constructive criticism backed by facts, but come on man you can look at my channel and easily see what you're saying isn't true.

It's a relative term. People browse here at different times of day, for varying amounts of time, so their new and top feeds will be different than others'. People post many pictures of "look at this silly pose I found" or "check out this cool item" or "here's an interesting unmarked location" per day, but the average person will not see many of them. These "is the game good now" posts are recurring often enough that everybody sees them on a regular basis. Even if it's only one or two posts per page, it starts wearing you down over weeks
---
And for the record, I just skip past those posts. But the backlash against people posting them doesn't give them a positive image of the game either. I just don't get why they have to keep being posted so often. There are search features here, even if it isn't already common sense to somebody to at least do some research yourself first
---
They either need compatibility with armor penetration or higher damage to offset it (or a universal nerf to energy resistance). And as someone who has low strength and uses the beam splitter, making them use shotgun perks would suck (unless you're talking specifically about enforcer and skeet shooter and even then they already benefit from tormentor and other rifle perks), and doesn't address their major issues regardless. Agree about durability though, even after the buff, they still break way too fast.
---
I think serums are under "misc" in the map screen
---

I was just wondering that’s all. I’ll play how I want to play thanks

One guy I'm sure was a griefer. His house was all locked up and you could see the vending machine, it logged you onto a ledge on the side of a cliff.
---
It'd be super cool but it's impractical (from a developers perspective).  You'd have to steam the audio in real time, whereas assets currently are stored on your machine (pc, ps4 xb1).

We can barely walk through whitesprings without breaking. Not complaining, merely making a statement.

If you vats with the grenade launcher the grenade rounds wont miss even if its a flying target. If the rounds miss they will literally turn around and go back to the target.

This is how I felt when I got a 2 shot ultracite laser rifle. I made it into the full auto laser shotgun, but could only use it for 30-40sec tops before it broke.

The game needs more caps sinks and you asking for cheap trave cost lol. Bethesda us never doing it.
---
One week if you read what he linked.
---
&gt; Speaking of future updates, we’re adding Patch 9.5 to our Wild  Appalachia line-up in order to bring a new repeatable event to the game,  called Project Paradise, and fix a few more bugs. We’re currently  planning to release this update on **May 21**, and we will have more details  about the new event in next week’s Inside the Vault.
---
Haven’t seen a legendary one yet...but have you ever face a godly one? I was out doing something  in the wasteland when my buddy alerted me to fast travel to him. Usually when he alerts me it’s an event we been grinding on or he has some items to give away. I pop out my pip boy and notice he was down by the lake where you take your swimming test and I thought hey he’s probably doing that test and doesn’t know about the Queen in that lake so I figured I come and help him out. Got there and he was on the roof shooting at some mirelurk kings and so I hopped on top and started blasting away. After an intensive fight with the queen and all I’ve noticed this one king that would not die at all. We were able to to see and bring his health down to zero but it’ll quickly go back up. He wasn’t able to do the test because of the god being in our presence so I just lure him away from the lake long enough for him to finish the test. Funny how we tend to follow gods but this one wanted to follow and rip me a new asshole for just poking his face with my bullets!
---
Hey. I’m usually on most days and willing to accompany you through situations. I get the anxiety aspect, though it doesn’t show with my level 100+ character. jgc15903 is me.
---
All I do is set down wet kindle
---
Would also be nice for the caps received to last as long as looting ones, for me by the time I register caps coming in, the amount has disappeared...
---
Guestimating my money coming in isn't how I like to do business.
---
Ultracite jetpack doesn't exist. The Calibrated Shocks plan goes for way more than that, often trade-only. Emergency Protocols should be a bit cheaper.
---
The plans for the pieces are a reward from the BoS questline now, so they'd only sell to people who don't know that.
---
Fallout New Orleans with rad storm hurricanes. Would be awesome

What plan glitch?   Never heard of it.

I get why some people dont like it but making posts saying put a pinned comment isnt going to stop it at all or being mean and saying im tired of seeing this post or do your own research isnt going to help but not you but other people have such concern over seeing a comment from somebody that just wants help or somebodys opinion makes my stomach turn because you dont know that person i have met my fair share of special needs people or kids on fallout 76 and im not saying everyone who posts it is special needs but someone that generally wants help and is greeted with hate this is a subreddit where people come to show there love thoughts and opinions on this game and it is ruined by people who are being negative just because of a group of people ask the same question multiple times a day
---
I had something like this happen to me yesterday. Was herding in some cattle and was hit by several high level ghouls, a level 50 3 star Sheepnightmarefuel, and a deathclaw. At level 11. No one could hear my screams. I died along side of Earl; RIP Earl, my poor lost cattle.
---
I will add you. Thank you! It's super frustrating leveling up one level a day and watching my bf level like 3 times a day.
---
Yeah, the numbers are pretty silly. Level 51 Deathclaw: 1150 hp. Level 50 Mirelurk King: 2200 hp. Deathclaws are much easier to hit too.
---
I did like 9 camp eventos. 0 badges :(
---
It's terrible isn't it? Feral Ghouls have a habit of coming out of nowhere and being twice my size and it's terrifying
---
If you play on PC, when you hit T to go to Repair, hit R to repair using your materials. :)
---
Wow I’m level 120 and didn’t even know that. Bought the plan forever ago for probably way too many caps 😂 never crafted the excavator just cuz I run ultracite T51b and didn’t see a use to waste my precious scrap
---
I just love all the fallout locations. there isn't one that i dislike. that's the thing about the games is that they do a great job at making you feel the atmosphere of the location.
---
Really regretting not picking up the Plague Rider Skin, hope it comes back so I can complete the set
---
I can add you and if we can make the emotes work or figure out a system (like, jump once for no, twice for yes) then I can have you talk to me. I just don't have a mic myself.
---
If anyone has the extra rad resistance I'll pay 1k caps to borrow it then give it back if it has the same bug where you auto learn PS4
---
I was talking about a *slight* discount for the sake of encouraging visiting other folks camps, not some game changing wholesale price slash. 
---
I think I’m in the wrong sub, I feel like people here tend to forget most players aren’t min-maxing Fallout ballers with three character builds that are constantly bouncing off the cap limit.
---
This, it would make building so much better.
---
Also, make the slanted walls snap to other walls.
---
All of the crits. Get a legendary gun with VATS bonuses, build high luck character with all the crit/VATS perks, add in some stealth, and spam crit headshots all day long.
---
My discord is different, it's ClareSaphire408.
---
Ik musician and the frog tadpole one ive heard is bugged, but for chemist I think its killing it with a syringer
---
Most people who are playing the game aren't listening to the controversies. Plus, different strokes for different folks. I mean hell, there's a market out there for race car and football video games. People enjoy what they enjoy.
---
Abandon bog town tall building roof elevator... fall down it.. about 20 typewriters.
---
Like say a Gatorclaw?
---
Oh i get it and for my normal character that works, but i actually have 2 accounts that i have been using since about december, i switched from ps4 to xbox one x, so i have a ton of stuff i have saved in the hopes they will just allow me to one day sell it to a vendor.  I just don’t feel like leaving my other game logged in doing nothing waiting to sell stuff.
---
I would just like to see everything be available to vendors is all.  I don’t see what the point of making ammunition and plans unavailable for that.
---
I feel like they're auto generated from an incredibly not-tested script.   Do #RANDOM with #RANDOM in/while/with #RANDOM.  With no output sanity checks.
---
NEXT:  "Take a picture of the SBQ cooking grilled radstag inside of a Vault during a radstorm"
---
I have 200 or give you
---
How long does Flora stay irradiated for after the Nuke Zone disappears?
---
I have some bubblegum for 5000.
---
Nobody says this. Lol
---
If anything, they like borderlands 2 more than fallout.
---
Fallout is the poor man's Borderlands with no vehicles and no multiplayer. 76 is a joke.
---
Sorry for not specifying
---
Yeah. Otherwise I would just invite random people to the team, go to bed in game then go to bed irl
---
False on chemist unfortunately. Shot and killed a Yao Gui today with one 😔
---
Yeah, Sunnytop especially was pretty fun. I liked all the gnomes there that helped cheer me on lol
---
If you are on in about an hour, I can give you the plans
---
Start scrapping cans.  They give aluminum and lead.
---
Probably Can do that
---
Whoops didn't comment
---
Wanted to revisit this and say thanks! Ran it since I needed stuff for Excavator + caps, netted a good several hundred caps for such little amount of work lol.  Thank you again!
---
survival should get a restart and be a closed system..
---
you can leave to play in adventure.. but once you do you cant go back...
---
Anywhere with radiation to get random ones. But buying them is a better option. 
---
And don't forget to use Starched Genes after you get what you want or you'll cry.
---
After seeing someone else saying they got it to work, I tried:
---
- Building a snare drum, acoustic guitar, etc, and playing them in my camp.
---
- Building them at a workshop instead
---
- Going to Watoga, Rusty Pick, etc, and playing every instrument
---
- Trying all of the above and playing until Well Tuned triggered
---
Nothing ever registered. :(
---
First question does it have a beam splitter on it?
---
It's not really a bug, just poor design choices (that may or may not be fixed in in the future).  First they did buff semi auto energy weapon durability, but I don't think that carried over to auto.  So they are kind of flimsy to begin with (before patch 7) and if you have a beam splitter the game calculates each beam as a separate shot so when you hit a shot with all beams you essentially just took however many shots your beam splits.
---
So poor durability, plus poor design on beam splitter leads to paper auto energy weapons. 
---
If anyone has any different info regarding auto energy weapons please correct me.
---
They recently buffed plasma rifles so if you get a chance to get one of those.
---
They're in Aid.
---
Good question, didn’t even think about that. I tried putting one in my vending machine, but it doesn’t show up in my inventory. 
---
I can store it in a stash container, so maybe that’s one way to give them away?
---
I ended up finding another one, so now I have 3 total.
---
Easier to kill Betsie and butcher her for her meat
---
Most likely can do that
---
Game is perfectly playable with or without duping.
---
voice chat has never worked for me.. ive never been able to hear any other players on pc
---
That makes a lot more sense! Thanks.
---
It was sarcastic... partially
---
Bash with it, as well as shooting everything. I smacked the queen with mine as well as level 1s near vault 76
---
Bash your enemies....
---
250 per
---
Impossible to implement with this game mechanic.
---
Don't over repair it, so take off weapon artisan. You only need to damage it a little bit to repair it. Just shoot one or two things and you should be able to repair it again. Also you need to shoot and damage mobs in order for it to cost durability.
---
I've not even seen wet kindling lol
---
I’d make a build around a 3*** bloodied ss +str drill
---
Bash and make sure you don't have weapon durability cards equipped
---
How about a challenge that says ***find*** Grahm. JFC, haven't come across him in weeks.
---
Gamertag?
---
I'm in Scandinavia, haven't recieved a survey email.
---
Bash it. Remove Gunsmith. Ballistic bock. Once you get it to like 99%, repair it to 100, then bash again. Getting it down from over &gt;100 first time around is the hardest
---
CHA? Damn that explains a lot - I would have thought the LUCK stat would have played a part
---
Explains why my son seems to get better rewards than me (he has a much higher CHA)
---
I can confirm i am also having the same issue with chemist.
---
Yes please. I know it's silly but it's not something I can control; I have severe social anxiety getting on voice chat with strangers. A text chat option that can be toggled on and off would be absolutely amazing and appreciated. I tried the mod but without the ability to properly block or report players to easily switch to just local / private / party chats, it's not the same.
---
Ahhh, I see.
---
You don't seem to understand basic logic.
---
Do you also have the problem that not all of the item images in the atom workshop load?
---
The whole site near the nuka cola factory
---
They fixed it the next day, then another method was found and they hotfixed it same day. They couldn't possibly be faster. What are you complaining about?
---
How do you even know the other team were using duped stuff? I get there's a current exploit but just because you got out geared doesn't mean they had to be dupers, or bought duped stuff. Some of us actually grinded and traded our way up there.
---
Reverse would just heal the enemy...
---
I just want a fallout set in Louisiana and there’s a cult of Huey long, everyone eats gumbo and people blast Dixie land on their pip boy while saying looziana
---
Nah. People would obviously just go around leaving poor reviews for petty reasons. If you like the camp, leave them a little goodie on their door step or buy a cheapo item in their vending machine. No need for ratings in a game like this.
---
That's true.  Next time I'm on, I'll look you up.  Just have to make room in my stash.  😉
---
Ok so they definitely are bugged for the time being. Kinda annoying but good to know its bugged for everyone. Hopefully Bethesda get a fix out soon.
---
There are sooooooooooooo many things I wish they'd do a little differently, and the ground around our CAMPs is one. I'm glad it sort of takes things away now, cause before grass and bushes sticking through the floor was ridiculous. I wish they'd give us the plants in our circle, so we could place them where we want them. That way I could keep the cute little trees, but put them in front, instead of halfway through the bathroom wall.
---
nah it’s just an automatic laser rifle
---
I hope so! I wasn't able to be around for the holidays so I missed the really cute Antler set. :c
---
Same as here QuakeSumo
---
I keep meaning to go in there. Maybe I'll look at it tonight.
---
That would be interesting.
---
And these are all possible currently? Not stuff they've patched out?
---
In that case it's probably due to them not receiving the same durability buff that semi auto laser weapons got for some reason.
---
How does this have no upvotes?!
---
not really. Seeing a level 45 player with God roll weapons and armour and level 200 without... they should increase the levels for some weapons to like level 100 instead of 45 or 50.
---
Since everyone nukes further north of prime lately the flooded train station is completely filled with super mutants who all have miniguns. My character is built to tank and deal damage but holt shit they shred me
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we were older? 
---
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long 
---
And wouldn't it be nice to live together 
---
In the kind of world where we belong.
---
I guess he's upset he's not the only one with good gear? Because nobody else should be allowed to have them but him.... duh
---
No they care more about turning the game into fortnight... sike no I hope not...
---
is there a perk that makes automatic weapons break slower? i have the regular weapon one
---
There are still several dupes that I know about and I'm sure more that I haven't heard of. The ones they fixed were just stupidly easy ones they 
---
 stupidly didn't figure out before releasing an update.
---
Ok thanks
---
I actually had that bug happen during a SQB fight a  few months ago..couple other players were using them...and no one could damage her...she just kept flying around, not landing. And there were a good 12-15 players..
---
I've  wanted to like and use the Tesla but, same reason as you for not using it.
---
Server hop feature? Either this is sarcasm or I missed something.
---
i made these videos today
---
Just loaded up FO76 to check and I do have that same issue too
---
So at what point did you open up a trade window with the other players and see the god roll they had?
---
Nope, I have no mods at all...and I had about 10 mods this morning.
---
No we didn't get out geared, we were all evenly matched...that's what I'm saying. We all had a chat when we all realised it was just a big circle jerk going on as we were just spawning in to kill one person then die to spawn in again and kill one person and die due to the mechanics of it. both teams were big fans of PvP and it was fun for a while but it just became pointless and both teams realised it. (oh and they were asking if we wanted and duped weapons) that's a bit of a give away
---
No worries bud, I’ll sell them below market value as well. Cheers, just shoot me a FR when you’re ready
---
I get this VERY often. I've noticed I see the issue less if I'm standing on solid ground.  Trying to fast travel while standing in a building often results in no travel.
---
He's a communist. He thinks everyone should have the same thing.
---
They better not. keep hearing rumours of a battle royal mode
---
Yeah, you're full of Sh**.
---
Yeah, this alone should be worth no less than 500 atoms
---
You don't need a window when the guy runs in front of you and one-shots every enemy in the dungeon you were about to clear
---
or in pvp, where this probably matters the most, when you get one shot by every other player
---
Emmet mountain waste disposal has a decontamination shower 30 steps away from some barrels you can get irradiated by. It's right inside the entrance
---
Lol I’m on an OG PS4 and worst case scenario for me when I’m in Whitesprings is a but of lag that eventually fixes itself
---
That can be done with simple 1* weapons with the correct build.
---
Shared XP only within a certain distance would work fine.
---
GRATS!  I just got mine too and feel very similarly.  I think I really would see a quality of life improvement from the refrigerated backpack mod.  I also think I am not going anywhere near the chores required for the 8 possum badges I need.
---
Its so you can't give everyone on your team lv3 hacking or lock picking (by perk sharing).
---
Get your Battle royal out of my game and go play fortnite with all the little kids!
---
:(
---
Not likely
---
I'm at the super mutant right now. Does someone want me to buy orb for them? Hurry up. I'm not gonna follow him for long.
---
Perhaps you should have stated that in the OP, because it sounded like you were just salty because you lost at PvP. Also report them!
---
It's not that bad.
---
It's got decent damage with the multi shot cannister, and seams to do bonus damage to limbs, often tearing of both legs from enemies and crippling them all over otherwise.
---
And the ammo is on the cheap side honestly, 2 acid and 4 ore = 2-5 shots, and lead ore is attainable in huge quantities relatively easily if you know where to go. But it is very heavy.
---
If the weapon got a durability buff, and multi shot was easier to get it could actually be quite a nice weapon. I carry 2, and have great success until they both break.
---
What about fusion cores? I've been selling them for 1c per %, so 100c for a fully charged one. The prices I've seen at other vendors are all over the place though, and since I don't use them for anything, it's kinda tough to gauge how valuable they actually are.
---
When a team all have explosive auto laser rifles it's pretty obvious. When you have spent as much time trading and playing as we have you can tell a god roll or legacy dupe a mile away. 
---
The point I am making is that if everyone has pretty much either the same weapon or a choice of about 3 or 4 massively duped weapons then what's the point, wheres the variation, Bethesda went to great length to put in the ability to have hundreds of different perk card builds and dozens of weapon and armour builds but everyone either has a AA faster fire rate, AAE, or explosive laser.
---
The point was supposed to be that if you put in the time and effort you were rewarded with good stuff, not anymore.
---
No
---
Honestly didn’t even know that, assumed once your knocked the pylon goes too.
---
Get battle royal out of here nobody but a very small but loud part of the game community wants pvp stuff.
---
We want pve mass hoard stuff 5 player vs 10,000 scorched. We want new place to explore and new loot to grind for.
---
Then get off your ass and trade for better gear.
---
Nailed it. Thank you. I’m a sucker for outfits so I’m sure I’ll be spending some unnecessary amount of caps on them. That and CAMP plans
---
I can see it now I'm looking for it, I'd never have noticed that that and now I waaaant it
---
No problem. Glad you liked it. It's my go to for easy caps.
---
I don't think it's a patch.. I think (and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong) that it will work the same way when the real Sheepsquach showed up... She'll just appear.
---
Report them for what? it was a good match and no one was salty at all. and I didn't sound like it at all? If I loose in PvP then that's fine, it's just a game.
---
Craft 3 low level 1's and run through point pleasant and Morgan Town Airport. Took me 15 minutes to damage all 3 to point of repair.
---
Since you have to kill 50 things with it, pretty easy, take of gunsmith &amp; it degrades pretty quick
---
This was one of the few I attempted before I just started grinding the campfire tales event instead, and it didn’t work for me either. Three different servers and I couldn’t get it to register.
---
I wish I could track FT costs...I've probably spent 4k hopping between all player camps, in the last few days. At least the CAMPs near Vault 76 and my own save me a few each time.
---
Nevermind that two of the dailys now are a 'photograph a friend' and 'hunter/hunted' almost every day.
---
But do you use power armor? Just wondering cause I’m working on a 2H Solo Power Armor build
---
As far as I know gunsmith does work on all weapons, the auto laser weapons just happen to break so quickly it doesn't really matter.
---
It's possible the perk isn't effecting them, but I think it's more than likely that it's just very poor design on Bethesda's part on those particular weapons.  Hopefully it gets fixed.  There is some reason for hope as they have made adjustments to energy weapons in two of the last 3 patches.
---
I wanna have it as a radio, for my CAMP where my shop is.
---
What?! Did I say that? read what I put before making silly comments
---
Exactly. Why would I pay 1000 caps for something an NPC vendor sells for 250? Why would anyone even pay the same price for something a vendor typically has? 
---
I'm always looking for PA mods of any type, and I willingly pay 1000 caps for people's extra. Heck, I even paid someone 2000 for a missing ultracite leg plan I didn't have because it was worth not having to wait around for someone to nuke the queen. But those are pricey at the Bos vendor and Ultracite is only from queen drops.
---
People will soon learn that charging too much yields no caps and just clutters up your base weight. If it is on sale from me, I'm trying to get rid of it and not turn a profit. Need missiles? 5 caps each. Want a nuke? 10 caps. They move fast. 
---
As a general rule, I typically sell stuff valued at 20 caps or lower at half price, and I sell stuff valued at 21 - 200 for about a quarter, depending on the item.
---
The only things I sell at a higher price is hard to make stuff, like PA torsos with the jet pack mod and I do that as a community service to those who can't fly.
---
Basic supply and demand in effect here.
---
Explosive laser weapons are a novelty, and not anymore 'god roll' than any other explosive weapon. With respect, even if they were duped weapons, that wasn't why you kept dying.
---
That is game changing for me. Holy shit.
---
How many people do you have in your friends list? Too many has been known to cause crashing and hiccups
---
I'll take level up and the camera generally over having a hunter/hunted and photo a friend almost every day.
---
Rounded foundation and walls would be nice too.
---
How else can I build Thunder dome?
---
Same... I've probably tried Watoga a dozen times. No ticks for the Watoga specific or even instrument specific requirements. I have not completed "Kill things with a musical instrument" or Sons of Dane, but I don't see why you would have to do the requirements in order - none of the others required that.
---
Grinding the event is definitely easier than these challenges. Don't forget to swap Frig/High-Cap with your friend if you want both - there's a cooler under the picnic area you can use to swap. They'll show up as "(Known) Plan: High Capacity Backpack Mod" or similar. Remember that it will be (Known) as soon as you get it.
---
I'm use ps4 pro and I get so many blue screens especially when logging in after this most recent update
---
Based on context it looks like the guy started PvP with OP and lost, then invited him to a party. Which based on the weird shenanigans you hear about “why you being all buddy buddy” is a legitimate question.
---
Read the post. It was a complete circle jerk, no one in both teams could get more than 1 kill each due to the mechanics of survival and we all had 1 shot weapons
---
I was wondering the same thing.  Or at least a way to "ping" our location if something interesting is going on.  Or if you need help.  I got trapped in a damn house on Aaronholt Homestead due to being unprepared for a sheepsquatch.  Was able to take it down after a long time but it would have been nice to have informed others of my predicament.  https://youtu.be/yaaA_KIGRbY
---
That as well, it's getting insanely frustrating and I feel like this sub isn't complaining enough about it
---
Report them for duping. Ya know, the thing you're here whining that Bethesda isn't doing anything about?
---
1) Normal
---
2) F1 pit gun
---
3) reverse
---
It's more of that there is only a handful of challenges we get ALL the time...
---
I used to be fanatical about getting all the challenges, if anything this has made it a lot easier to not bother with them. I'm not going through all the trouble for 10-20 cents worth of atoms. Its not fun running around trying to take pictures of chickens and squirrels let alone this "take a picture of Graham frowning on the toilet during a full moon while wearing a full clownsuit and hopping on one leg and drunk on nukashine, starving and diseased with rad worms specifically and addicted to buffout during a rad storm" type stuff. 
---
Also I've pretty much got what I need for my character's appearance (Bethesda prove me wrong) and don't have the camp budget to even use all the cool stuff I already have let alone buy more. (Why they made vending items use camp budget in addition to stash space who knows)
---
Darryl Fraer?
---
Try the new quests.
---
That the whole point!! God I wish people would read the post. Reporting does nothing because Bethesda aren't doing anything about it. That's what I'm annoyed about.
---
Either they pulled them from the loot tables or I have really bad luck - cannot find tent plans anywhere. Repeated hopping.
---
hot tip to any low levels reading this.  try and grab the pylons instead of the high levels.  
---
i had a low level buddy go down while holding all three charges.  we had a solid 20s of open damage, then we revived him and he died.  
---
repeat.   
---
it worked out great.
---
Yeah I finally got that high capacity mod today and was hella confused as to why I had already somehow learned it until I read up on it. Is it only those two plans or is it all of them?
---
“This is your host /u/supermagicalcookie just letting your know, that harpers ferry is the best nuke spot. Up next: Dixie land”
---
I think it’s Thursday...
---
The night vision lens costs 5 merit badges at the camp Adams Possum vending machine
---
Only High Cap and Refrigerator afaik. They're the only ones that cost 8.
---
The Armor mod was a consumable plan and I could not craft it without consuming the plan.
---
Stick to the Forrest region of the map (left side of map) as the creatures and critters are levelled to your lower level until you have some half decent weapons and armour to venture eastwards and more experience.  I made the mistake of going east too soon and died a lot.  Or found myself just constantly running away from everything.
---
Love this. Please do a video on Biv!
---
That's me
---
Go get the crossbow at Palace of the Winding Path, go to point pleasant at the weapons workbench behind the Mothman museum, do a repair without weapon artisan, kill a few scorched with the crossbow, repair, kill a few more scorched, repair.
---
What are all the steps? It's funny because the first one is similar to the last nuke step lmao.
---
Inside the Vault used the word "activate", so I don't think there'll be a patch or server maintenance. Next announced patch is on May 21st. 
---
also, the Purveyor comes on thursday, not tomorrow.
---
You are not a dipshit. This is the reddit equivalent of forgetting to attach a file to an email and if that makes you a dipshit then so am I. And I don’t want to be so neither are you.
---
‘Tis!
---
Yep been happening a while. If you join event though it takes you to the right place.
---
Nice thanks
---
Be on. In a second
---
Melee seems to break it faster and remove gunsmith.
---
You could call it Y.E.L.P.
---
Which armor mod?
---
Most materials and ingredients are easy to get somewhere. 
---
I struggled to farm plastic before I realized I can just server hop grafting steel and kill low level super mutants. They drop a ton of laser rifles, which give me 10 plastic each (15 Int, scrapper perk). Killing enemies is a good way to get easy materials in general. I don’t know if there’s an enemy that drops aluminum regularly though.
---
The Armor Plate one. I haven't unlocked insulated or leaded.
---
Yup It is the Pvp sever so it is not like you didn't know what you where getting into i dunno if its a griefing issue or whatever from Bethsaida eyes but if it is due to people having to pay repair costs for stuff that got wrecked while they had no recourse to prevent i guess you just alter the number of resources it takes to repair most camp deployables and walls so they only use the main common materials if they where broken while you where away from the camp by x number of yards that would take the worst of the "sting" out of that happening.
---
Not a woman, but I’ve played with a few women since I started and I haven’t seen anything bad. They’re just other players as far as most people seem concerned.
---
I just encountered a second Deathclaw Hide in a random container. This one was definitely in a metal box between the Armor Crafting Station and the PA Crafting Station at Camp Venture. Kind of doubt it's a location worth farming specifically for this, but it may be a useful data point nonetheless.
---
What do you want? That report button to insta-ban anyone you use it on? It's a process and a tool to help Bethesda to identify exploiters. If you're not going to use it and claim Bethesda simply doesn't care your just doing it to yourself at that point.
---
Or maybe you are a legendary enemy
---
Ah understood. I was reading that way wrong.
---
Sunnytop by far was the most fun to run.
---
I got my 2nd tadpole back last night and will have my 3rd Tuesday morning. Not even remotely motivated to do more than that honestly. Meh. Grats to you for having the drive i doubt I'll get.
---
A guy dressed like this wouldn't last 5 minutes in the wasteland I knew from previous games. This is the outfit of some character that died in a horrible way for a really humorously dumb reason, and I read about it from notes before finding the remains and his last holo tape.
---
Will do.
---
Lol
---
In the pipboy yes. But I just checked (all I sell is serums) and in the MAP screen where you can view items people are selling via category, serums are in misc. So you can find them quickly without having to fast travel everywhere.
---
I’ve bought everything I’ve ever used so don’t feel bad
---
"Soup, stew, **and even more soup.***" 
---
He's so right. If only I wasn't a carnivore, I could have all the soup.
---
Update to my other post above. I just found a deathclaw pelt in a toolbox at Drop Site V9.
---
Oh ok
---
I don’t see much banding either
---
Msg When you're on
---
I don't know about chemist but I killed a Yao Guai with a Syringa and was given credit for Hunter. I might have used my handmade to drop it's health down a bit first because the Syringa was barely doing any damage... but I'll take it.
---
Dead humans are all over the map. You’ll even find some dead vault dwellers.
---
Additionally, you can only make text posts to this sub. You can upload to imgur and post a link in your text post body.
---
You'd think New Vegas launched with free massages and Raid, given how much love it gets these days. But no, I've read about the criticism it got at launch for being buggy. I guess I'm used to bugs and some wonkiness, coming from 7 Days to Die. Or maybe I'm too lenient. Either way, these games are great. I'll shush now.
---
seriously dude? sorry i was at work i tought they didn't that is a great new thanks :D
---
Have you opened tickets with Bethesda's support team and explicitly detailed out these duping methods you speak of?
---
True. They shouldn't thought. Nothing in the atom shop is even worth it anymore.
---
Thanks, me Lord. :)
---
It should be if you send screenshots of somones inventory on trade and they have dozens of the same weapon. I have reported loads of Dupers with screenshots of their inventory and videos of them openly discussing duping and yet i still See them on Facebook and in the game days and weeks later. I could send you screenshots of allsorts of people's dupe lists.....one guy had nearly 40 AA faster fire rate handmade with him amd openly advertising online to sell for real money...reported 3 times....still See him every day with new stuff....
---
Bad luck friend, I've spent about 10 minutes total hopping the lighthouse between 4 characters. Maybe consider you passed one that was there. Give it a bit to load in.
---
Are you on PC? I'll make you a camera.
---
Check Scorchbeasts guano piles, as well as toolboxes and similar containers in the cranberry bog area. I just found one today at Drop Site V9.
---
It wasn't a typical dessicated corpse.  It was a person that looked like they had been alive moments before.  I'll try to post to imgur to show you.
---
Yes some are bugged... Read here https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/46454/~/the-order-of-the-tadpole-quest---fallout-76
---
Wouldn't the simplest thing to do is disable the ability to take damage from someone invulnerable. It gives you precious seconds to reposition before actual combat starts after the invulnerability is lifted.
---
Might give people with lower pings an advantage but no system is going to cover every case.
---
Where are you building that you have to fix it that often?
---
Okay cool. I’m intrigued.
---
Go hit the ski lodge and collect all the ski poles It’s a decent source of aluminum
---
I don’t even really believe those posts. I think most just like the attention.
---
Yes that would be a massive improvement
---
I understand 99% of the time people are civil normal human beings. I was asking if there were any extreme 1% of the time cases that people wanted to share.
---
Im so thankful classical exists. If I hear that lady scream in my ear clucking again, im going mad. Theres a lot of Appalachian folk music locked in the library of congress that could just be put in. Copyright free.

---
I wish.
---
Also, don't over repair the weapon, just normal to 100%, then you can fix it after like 3 hits and fix it again, don't have to break the weapon fully.
---
think I'm gonna hold out till we get the spawn point floor mat, I took the 'Notice' sign and wrote 'shop downstairs' over the words under Notice.... hopefully that works for now lol.
---
Took a picture of a guy's camp I visited.  Over his vending machines, he had placed on a wall with the light bulb lettering with two arrows pointing down "Buy my shit".
---
So I did.  Got a nice lever action rifle.  😉
---
Yeah man.
---
Yeah same here. I sell things like psycho and mentats at 10 while I sell the combined ones like psychobuff at 20. No takers yet

They get what they’re doing. The whole point is to cut off earning atoms in game practically, while it still being technically possible (to technically not go back in the premise of in game earning).
---
It’s juat typical shitty corporate behavior that Beth has gone full in on.
---
You got any +str left arms?
---
I just kept farming Brahmin for the archer challenges. Lol
---
I did read it. Your post read more like a rant about how duping evened the playing field so now you can't easily win like you used to. 
---
If that wasn't your intent, you need to write it better. I'd say it was just me who misunderstood, but everyone is giving you crap, not just me.. So this tells me it's poorly written. Either that or we're all out to get you....which is more likely?
---
indeed it can and I love nothing more than playing people who put thought and effort into their build. There just a much higher class of player and always less aggressive  and usually friendly when/if they loose. 
---
We get messages all the time from kids with a fully duped set of weapons and armour but who can't play at all..and when they loose they get salty.
---
I think like destiny and the division it should be within a certain range of you squad to get xp
---
Server hopped for 4 hours at Willard’s and Whitespring, nothing.
---
It’s galling to think people get paid money to design shit like this.
---
Can't shoot if you are popping a stimpak to heal your friend who has no concept of mortality
---
Haha, duuude so true. 🤣 Every third post is "be honest guys, should I buy this game?", "is it good now?", "been thinking about trying it out", "is it fun yet?" etc. The game is dirt cheap now, just give it a shot. Think of it like buying a case of beer. You may regret it later, but it might end up being a good time. ☺
---
FOUND THE LARGE TENT PLAN. Responder bot in Whitespring. Just had to keep hopping. Thx all.
---
It is worth it for the backpack, who wouldn't want an extra 60 carry weight?  I'm enjoying it because it is forcing me to use weapons I've never used before (crossbow) and I found that incredibly fun to use.  I now want to find a legendary crossbow (if it exists).  It's taking me to areas of the map I usually avoid or visited early on and missed a lot of what is actually there.  I never noticed the whale skeleton in the Toxic Valley before, and now I have to take a pic of it.  I've cooked recipes I've never cooked before, which has meant gathering ingredients that I've never bothered to get before.  Yes some of it is tedious, and there are definitely bugs that need to be sorted, but it's not something that can be, nor should be, completed easily and quickly.  You actually feel a sense of achievement when you complete a badge.  The Campfire Tales event can drop plans for more cool mounted critters for your camp (I got a Stingwing!) and I've picked up some low level legendary armour and weapons, which I won't use but will turn into scrip.
---
I think we could do with something more like a jury rigged gatling laser that does this. Would definitely have to use a new ammo type. Maybe you can make damaged fusion cores to use in it?
---
As long as it's entirely optional, I'd be okay with this. Personally, I *love* the flora, and I've recently revamped my CAMP's garden to make sure as much of it shows as possible, as opposed to being despawned by crops. Not an easy feat, given that things seem to be deleted in a wide circle around most things you place. It'd be nice if we could get rocks, trees or grass that we can place ourselves to control where it all goes, and to have the option to scrap naturally-spawned trees/rocks without having to have an object sit in the spot. 
---
I've got a rock that keeps spawning in front of my house's stairs, and I've only managed to get it to stop by carefully placing a gourd plant near enough to make it despawn. Even then, it was difficult to do because only tatos seemed to make it go away in the first place. I had to move a tato plant over, despawn the rock, then move the gourd into place while trying to remember where the "despawn" zone is.
---
Anyways, yeah! More CAMP customisation would *always* be good, as long as changes like removal of flora is optional.
---
Any interesting heavy weapons?
---
Oh sweet summer child....

I'm gonna pretend you didnt mean to type that.

You thought Tadpole was tedious.....😂 Wait till you see what you have to do for possum badges just so you can add a mod.....
---
I saw the lists and immediately got bummed out and closed the game... Needed a break after that grind. Tomorrow is another day for those possum badges
---
I've seen that body too it was at the dried up lake near the mansion where the order of the mysteries. She had a black hat and a white dress and I thought it  was a dead player but I was able to loot it. I was a bit surprised because it was a fresh kill. There were scorched near by. I found it to be a bit interesting.
---
Apparently there is a way to farm the campfire but uts a 1 in 10 success chance... According to the youtuber: InnovSurvivalist
---
Can we ditch plans that we've already read ( learned ) with out losing the ability to do said plan.  
---
They eat up tons of stash space
---
Lol today is Bethesda day of making 30 atoms pretty hard.
---
I think I found the same thing by the fire station. It was one of the random spawns a bunch of super mutants a tent and a decapitated lady?
---
Ah hell, I'll give you some credit I guess. You actually play this game, and comment here knowing you're going to receive plenty of negativity. Tell you what, if you can link me just the audio files in question I'll listen to them, form my own opinion and then watch your video and see if we match up on theories.
---
I can help
---
What is your GT and I will join you
---
If you're still willing, absolutely. PM me your PSN if so

Thank you much
---
Survival mechanics causing frustration. Concludes duping is the problem. Got it
---
Well only a few people are being assholes so that tells me thet they are just assholes who like to be assholes on reddit who make no constructive points and just insult you. That's not a coherent argument...i made no reference to duping evening the playing field, that's you bias not mine. leveling the playing field is one thing but making everyone almost identical means it's impossible to play. The whole point is that each build has it's own advantages and disadvantages, It means that theres variation. 
---
That was the whole point of the game, but with everyone having the same weapon and same armour then it's just a game of quick draw.  You clearly don't understand the point of this post at all.  either that or your a duper who feels he has to defend his position, or more likely somone who doesn't want to work for anything and just get time good (I'm sure you will say your not and you traded and farms everything you have just like everyone else who has legacy weapons)
---
Mine was very similar except the lady wasn't decapitated.  Maybe Bethesda is going to introduce human NPCs and this is foreshadowing.
---
You need level 3 Wasteland Whisperer
---
Yes - somethings have come back thru
---
I’ve always wanted to nuke the water park, never launched a nuke. Too lazy.
---
How interesting. I wonder why they did that. Good to know, though. Thanks :)
---
Do we know what level the Purveyor's generated legendary items will be? 
---
They make no mention of it here: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor
---
Occam’s razor.
---
The devs who gated a fundamental
---
Mechanic behind random tourist spawns players can spend hours server hopping and come up with nothing, couldn’t balance damage/armor, shit the bed with a lack of NPC’s, always on voice chat, and have made innumerable other bad to absurd design choices have staked out a good but unfun game design (which is an oxymoron really)
---
-or-
---
Are just trying to boost atom sales.
---
Just pick all three, get downed and stay downed for whole time, do it two times 100% succes.
---
Read it properly. The survival mechanics just highlighted the problem.  The mechanics just turn it in to a game of of who can be arsed to stay the longest. If I spawn in then I can kill you but you can't do any damage to me, then you spawn in and you can kill me but I can't do any damage to you and it just goes round and round. If we didn't all have 1 shot weapons then it might just be interesting
---
Make it a priority and you will never run out, I made it a priority from the start because I learnt from fallout 4, that and adhesive, and I’ve got 300+ of each at all times, now I just need to make leather, asbestos and ballistic fibre a priority, fuck.
---
Just watched both, and I see you're using the regular floor trick. And you still need a foundation to start your wall thing. Was hoping for some new stuff. Still cool, though.
---
Thank you!
---
If you’re on Xbox I can carry you through it
---
If you're maxed on vendor caps for the day, hunt for some legendary enemies and just sell what they drop in your shop for a few hundred caps. Someone will usually buy them. I've sold a couple weapons this way.
---
Hi. I am a woman. Been playing about 750 hours, always with a mic. I team up with guys all the time and have a pretty regular crew of about 10 or so dudes that I met on FO76 and can play with (not usually all at once), but we're always taking on strangers and noobs. I'm also a pretty active trader. In all that time, I've had two experiences that got weird because I'm a girl. One was a guy I regularly played with that got possessive and weird and had to be tossed, and the other was a creepster that honey, baby, sugared me from the get-go despite my protestations. Block. 
---
The rest of the harassment was from douchecanoes that didn't care if I was a guy or a girl they just wanted to fuck with someone. There have been a handful of those losers. 
---
For the record, I'm sure being on a team insulates me from the worst of the misogynists, but I trade solo, and those guys are always expecting another guy. No weirdness there though, just subtle surprise. 
---
We need to be good about reporting the harassers to Bethesda and following up so they can suspend or ban them. I don't want that in my game.
---
Hell, I'd settle for a weed whacker that allows me to knock down the aforementioned tall grass.
---
So are you on
---
On now
---
No problem at all
---
Let me get on I'll be there in a second
---
To trigger the bug ending youd have to continuously pick up wet kindling while dry triggers the wendigo ending.
---
The one that prompts you upon log in- if another camp is in place of your camp, you can choose to try a different server that isn’t occupied.
---
Ah, gotcha.  Thanks
---
Yeah saw one last night. Right by someones camp some guy in a tub with a guitar. Idr seeing one before that though outside of the dead vault people.
---
This would make it way more fun with friends as well instead of having to wait for them to get some pot shots in on a legendary you've found
---
Anyone know why Thursday? Isn't Tuesday the normal day for new stuff to unlock?
---
I've never had the Imposter outfit drop for me, but I've got about 5 full sets  the Mascot outfit and 10+ White Wolf Fedoras...and 2 Imposter helmets and Fixer Plan dupes..
---
 I actually got lucky teh other day and bought an imposter outfit off a player vendor for 250caps or something silly...I ended up buying some ammo from him as well, just to show my thanks. I usually see them for over 1k caps...
---
25% it’s an easy grind if you server hop
---
So much of 76 is random chance, it really does make me miss the single player games where you have goals and work your way down a path to achieve it rather than do this, do it again, not quite do it again, one more time maybe, ok probably just one more time now, same dialog like the first time but one more try...
---
Ah yes you're right my good man. I was thinking tomorrow because all the new content usually drops on Tuesdays.
---
I traded off all my AAE and BE shotguns for BE Gatling,50 Cal and LMG.  The shotgun nerf (rebalance?) was insane.  The pellet drop off damage now requires you to be incredibly close to the target.  I can one shot 68 super mutants from across Wes Tek parking lot with 1 shot of a BE Prime Gatling gun.. 1 5 mm round... I’m so glad I swapped to heavy guns from shotguns after the nerf.  Couple the efficiency of the prime Gatling with the sustained dps of the BE 50 cal for killing the queen,  you will be incredibly satisfied.  I have a feeling Bloody builds are gonna get that nerf bat soon.
---
Idk it sort of makes sense to me that they break far more quickly. There should be a reason not every yahoo in the wasteland is able to sling laser weapons around before they break. I'd like to see them do more damage though.
---
Found a Grahm....but he despawned before I even fully load in.. :( need more luck
---
I genuinely did.
---
Today it was 3 out of 5 that I skipped
---
I leveled up in Watoga wearing power armor wielding a guitar sword, and then made 10 booze
---
I just got mine tonight at the Colonel Kelly monument on my second server hop. Was in the process of creating a post about it to have people join me if they wanted it, and then the server crashed haha.
---
That monkey at the end scared me and I got startled and accidentally shot it up close with an explosive weapon! I died but completed the course! 😂
---
Well that's unfortunate. Sounds like it's been that way for a long time.
---
Sorry, hadn't checked reddit for some hours. Friend request sent but logging off for tonight. Let's try tomorrow.
---
You can find a dead vault dweller in harpers ferry in one of the houses
---
I’ll be sure to check it out, thanks!
---
I always be the one picking the kindling when everyone's killing the Nia happily, so I think not just the group, events should be consider 'doing together' and having some certain percentage of the loots as well, might as well highlight your loots too, it's not fun to check every single meat piles and see if there's things belong to me lol
---
Spoken about the meat piles, meat piles should gather up and being meat ball just like how super mutants storage their foods, it will be super on the looting QoL, since sometime you just can't found the piles, and sometime they stacked up and you missed what you've earned, I don't think the game was targeted to be a 'looting is challenging game' right, since you can just tag enemies once and get things, this change should be OK following that logic I think
---
And if they do the crazy weird challenges, it should be a monthly challenge and be worth like 500+
---
If they have crappy stuff for crazy prices, I jump on top and leave a bag of fertilizer and a toilet paper roll.
---
Is the Purveyor going to be in the unused train station or.... What? The preview image looks like a train station, I think.
---
Anyone know?
---
Damn right I do
---
I confirm, but people say they have completed Musician. I can't.
---
Aw damn.. I JUST sold one!!!!
---
This needs to happen. Also I made a post about this awhile back. Since it didn't work out that well, I decided to make this a gold post. Hope it helps this get noticed.
---
Hey, noob question, how do you get those titles next to your name?
---
I shot and killed two Yao Gaui with Bleedout and nothing happened.
---
I just bought them in white springs, then repaired it when I was done killing things.  Should be easier.  Don’t over repair with weapon artisan either!
---
I managed to get a LOT of them during one SBQ. Dead ones count, so all you have to do is run and take pics.
---
Edit your flair on the right side of the page where your name is you'll see a edit flair option
---
Hell, I like the idea.  But in the meantime, I'm using the travel agent perk.  😃
---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, entirely optional should always be the way to go when possible. I've even gone so far as to plant the upward-facing power connectors on the ground to get a big tree or rock to disappear. Looks stupid, but not as annoying as an intruding tree branch forcing its way through the wall of my workshop.
---
I don't think it's asking for an awful lot, but I don't know how it works, to be fair. Just seems reasonable that we could cull the overabundant weeds that creep everywhere possible, as we nuke each other left and right. Surely we could pluck some errant flowers.
---
Your'e funny. Not once did i defend or condone duping. I guess if i don't agree with you I'm automatically a duper. It couldn't possibly be that you did a piss poor job at expressing your concerns. You make some decent explanations in your comments, had they been in your original post, i might have even agreed with you. 
---
Anyway I'm done here, say what you will. I've already wasted enough of my time. Good luck and good day to your sir.
---
I did cub scouts the. Webelo scouts. After that I skipped boy scouts as I moved and didn't want to join a different troop. Instead I joined an explorer scout group for fire explorers. So far I have answered about half within the first 2 times. Sometimes they have a stupid way of asking something. Like in the first aid, there is a question about tourniquets, and as a retired EMT, the only time I applied a tourniquet was to temporarily cut blood supply to get an artery clamped, or because a patient lost an arm, and I just wanted to keep him from bleeding out. I am not counting starting IVs, as that is a luxury, not always available.
---
Quite frequently, at random spawn locations.
---
Capitalism wins again!
---
Yeah some effort like what effort? Shouldn't i know how to find him after 600hours? he doesn't have just one spawn.....
---
You can still craft it. Both fridge and High Cap are learned when you buy them. You'll have a plan (Known) High Cap Backpack Mod in your inventory.....
---
.... and you can pass that to another player by dropping or placing it in a container. They'll also learn it once they pick it up. Pass it around along with the fridge mod if your whole team wants that.
---
_Does not_ work with the cheaper mods.
---
That is a fantastic question.
---
Doesn't work with the cheaper mods.
---
just a simple white plaster interior wall please!
---
Anytime buddy
---
Theres fresh vault dwellers. I think one is in the portopotty at the fair. You can shoot their head off just like a living creature.
---
And it should share the skin that you unlocked with atom, it always bother me a bit when I put full floor it had skin, but when it's the half or the 1/4 one, it's wooden or iron bars, think they should add glass/metal skin on the floor as well, it don't needed to always being 'painted' right, glass looks pretty, and you can use glass on your cliff camp to scare people as well, metal just cool
---
They should make the floor being able to snap on the side of the foundations as well btw, that's what floor for right?
---
They buffed plasma pistols/rifles recently. It's no longer the absolute worst.
---
Laser is still pretty lame.
---
Programming...not so much
---
Hahahahah!
---
When shit gets wacky, Try unplugging your console and plugging it back in.
---
I no longer visit camps near there. Almost everyone one is extremely common recipes and plans with one star legendaries from the ghouls there. Maybe some .38
---
Pointless. :\
---
Power Plants and industrial locations are good for gears and screws.  Also, you can select them as items that you want to find and items containing them will be marked when looting or picking up items.
---
Yeah but sometimes when i ding not prepared i don't have chance to grind whole level in that day.
---
Yup right between two camps at a lake in the middle of nowhere.
---
Take a picture of someone dress as something in somewhere held something is a bit annoying when you don't have friend.......(playing the game), I know it's challenge, but judge on half of the challenge it don't seems designed to be 'that hard' though
---
Thanks for the offer! But I can’t get on tonight unfortunately, sorry.
---
16 times a day? Lol
---
I’ll go check it out, thanks for the location!
---
rip
---
I’ve selected them in the past and its helpful, thanks for the location and advice!
---
In preview I read short message like "ni-" and I was wrong
---
i wish i could but its on PC and i did restart anyway lol
---
I didn’t know ski poles gave aluminum, thanks for the tip!
---
Arktos pharma has at least 3 level 3 computers and a couple lower ones too.
---
Nope, you can be anywhere as long as you're on a team.
---
Armor bags are +30 carry, +90 (tech. 91) ER or DR or RR.
---
High Cap is 120 carry, -60 ER, -60 RR
---
Refrig is +30 Carry
---
Does intelligence really increase earning that much?! I might have to rethink my horribly planned build haha, thanks for the advice!
---
Ahhh thank you so much! I want to level a melee alt, and this will be incredibly handy. 
---
Thank you :)
---
Have you tried unplugging your xbox and plugging it back in?
---
I guess you could use RadShield for a few more seconds of life. Though you're still gonna have to be quick and you're still gonna die post-photo.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
Here's a few more for the list. I got all of these today at these locations:
---
* Angler's can spawn at the Cranberry Glade.
---
* Bloodbugs can spawn at the Bootlegger's Shack.
---
* Gulpers can spawn at the NAR Repair Yard.
---
I feel like new vegas really took a page from the first and second fallout in having a huge selection of guns. Maybe not even all terr8bly useful or practical, but they were all fun to mess around with at the very least.
---
Thanks I'm putting together a weightless set. And then that thought hit me. I might just get the chameleon mutation and try it out
---
Tesla rifle comes from Robobrains.
---
Railway and Handmade are both at vendors. Watoga and Grafton? I don't remember.
---
Ah nice. I ignored that one because I was thinking that would take sooooo long
---
Thank you
---
Atlas Observatory has a few terminals!
---
posiden going into the reactor room
---
In vault tec university, down in the vault simulator on the wall as you fist go down the stairs
---
Try the water park. He spawns next to a car you can see from the fast travel point. Five seconds tops to see if he's there, then hop.
---
Before some patches we were hunting SBQ hard style. 7Minutes silo 3minutes to kill SBQ. 600caps in 30minutes just from event, server hop another guy go silo. This whole day for weeks. If there was not that ugly bottlecap cap i would have so much caps now.
---
also abbies bunker i think
---
It used to be glitched and worked without being on a team. You could test it by crafting something, toggle, repeat. I would think it was fixed by now but worth checking....
---
Yes at middle mountain cabins also check for royal jelly behind cabin near the grave 👍
---
Kates grindhouse. NW of uncanny caverns
---
Sugar grove for screws and springs. Grab all the fans and clipboards.
---
I like the idea of being able to look what sells the best for me and take advantage of that.
---
posiden abbies bunker
---
I know how and where to get mats lol
---
I've just been spam making gauss rifles trying to get the suppressor unlocked, I've made like 15 so far, using super duper too obv.
---
Why should someone get experience for not contributing, especially given that a teammate can be on the other side of the map? Instead, exp could be awarded for support activities, ie, reviving teammates, etc. It breaks immersion to pretend an enemy is carrying specific loot for everyone in the party. If you're supporting your party, your party should support you. Make em pony up.
---
The buff to Plasma recently was nice, but needs another 20% at the least.  
---
Ammo for Plasma is a pain, NOTHING drops it, and it's super expensive to craft.  
---
Meanwhile nearly every robot drops Fusion Cells and since I can't use my Laser Rifle while it's broken for the 20,000,000th time that stacks up fairly nicely.  
---
But when I can use it, there's still the problem that energy resistance and low damage make it pretty pathetic.
---
I'm not sure you would get the quest but I will give you one if you're on PS4
---
Not sure how to post a link, but if you go Google nukes the dragon fallout 76 you should be able to find a build creator
---
Yeah, it's great. That plus foods and sleep are pretty handy.
---
I think teams are bugged now. Check the bottom left of your screen and make sure you see their name. If not, break the team and try again.
---
This doesn't happen to me (so far) as long as I see their name.
---
If you're on PC and selling disease cures, you can have all my caps. 
---
Nobody ever sells disease cures.
---
I never once used the word "everyone".
---
The very fact that you are so deeply, personally offended by this is the most millenial thing you could have done. Pure irony.
---
There is also a buttload of fresh food lying around. (Hot dogs, produce, etc.. Stuff that rots in a week) Still fresh looking fish at a grillplace.. etc.. Our vault obviously opened right after the scorched breakout. And now everything is frozen in time. It kinda bugs me that all that careful worldbuilding took place but the continuity of events fell off the edge.
---
For some people it's clearly also a looting pvp feast, they will hit the bomb when it's close to others, and rush to downed person, grab all loots or wait 20 secs until that person died, then grab the junks, it was really something gold too see on the humanity
---
So I always grab all loot on the squash and rush like something was on fire, it basically the same though, my carry weight can be sort later
---
I’d say 80-100 for a full one is reasonable, unless you have a lot of them and can sell them for cheaper, maybe 50 lowest. I like your idea of 1%=1c
---
Wrong in every way, even. I never said it insulted me. At all. Develop better reading comprehension.
---
LOL just before I left work this happened. I was telling my wife "I hate going to whitesprings Fn ghouls, diseases, glitches." arrivre they all start sliding at me on the floor ""see Fn whitesprings." I know players that have spent 500 or more hours there farming and power leveling. I cant stand more than one trip in usually.
---
"Suckers."
---
Actually, I have a small amount of Meds in my store and a lot of plans, mods, and recipies \[PS4\].  My money maker tends to be the couple of serums that I can make (Speed Demon &amp; Marsupial) , 100% fusion cores, and Nuka Grenades.  My CAMP is in the Mire next to Thunder Mountain Power Plant.  I only put a few of each serum up because of the weight but refill them as they sell out.
---
It just keeps getting better  lol
---
I experimented with that, didn’t help. Still [Needs Support], even when green.
---
I get so much food because I’ve been protecting my resource camps, I don’t worry too much about cost, it’s more the weight.  they need refrigerators and coolers to pack some of the fancier stuff around though. That would be the best way to make a market for the specialty foods.

Now I really want a cryolator xD
---
If they are doing one third the damage if ballistic weapons with a higher ammo cost indont see any reason that they break faster, especially when lasers are just light and ballistic is confined explosions. It would logically make more since that ballistic break faster.
---
As long as it shows what parts are actually on it. The way it shows attachments/mods on gear would be perfect.
---
Lasers need some TLC
---
Hopefully it’ll be a mailing system, you can send/receive items from friends. Or it could be a LFG sort of system
---
Have you tried going to the penitentiary near the water park? Decent amount of enemies
---
I got like a 1000 aluminum in a day once just go raid some workshops
---
alright now we're talking
---
Lemme know when u do get on and ill get ya them if u want. I dont use most of my junk lol
---
I misread your edit as "this sub sucks ass" and was like but everyone was helpful...and then re-read it lol.
---
True I hope it aint something wack
---
It was full of diseased protectrons my last visit.
---
2 in the new Morgantown airport
---
 Anyone who wants to borrow any plan/mod on PS4? 
---
I’m not looking especially for free, but i wouldn’t mind! 
---
 Add me: @booddha666! 
---
 Thank you so much for posting this, seeing this one made my morning and my coffee taste better!
---
What are you gonna do with your atoms?
---
600+ hrs and i still find plans i don't know at players vending machines.
---
I'm NOT buying your bullshit monopoly money, Bethesda.
---
In this game builds are pretty dependent on what weapons you have, and can be highly customized. Save for a few must have perks there's no real standardized builds. It would help if you had an endgame vision in mind so we can offer advice on how to maximize it.
---
No it is because of no anti armor
---
Let me make it clear, NOT the Firebreather gear
---
I had to take three barrels to prevent contamination in a lake. I’m out here getting +7 rads and someone is concerned with picking up three barrels of radiation that does absolutely nothing.
---
It should also do that for events, just like dungeons in WoW and other online RPGs
---
My partner and I tested this tonight, and I can confirm that you do indeed get legendary items when a teammate downs a legendary without you tagging the creature. We found that the player not doing damage still needed to be in close proximity to the kill. This was the case for creatures that dropped legendaries but weren't marked as legendary as well.
---
Try hooking up a terminal. Makes it so much easier!
---
It’s worth a lot more than that, I sold a full set for 10k caps last month.
---
I hope so - it would be nice. Even if we could just use it as a guest book sort of thing, when visiting other camps.
---
The backpack grinding plus camera grinding is too much. Theyve got to make more content instead of recycling like this. The campfire was a step in the right direction
---
I saw him earlier today.  Chally too!  No where near any workshops of course.
---
Dang. I got some farming to do.
---
Anyone have tips for the Toxic Valley critters?
---
I would too! But unfortunately I do not have a choice :D
---
And add 'don't scrap something' function as well, I'm worried it will expand just like those things that I just packaged up lol
---
This. As long as the terminal is on the same circuit as the lights you can cycle them all at once.
---
You got me there chief👉👉
---
For badges is  best to server hop and grind event: campfire tales. It have 25% chance to give badge as reward, same percentage works for both pioneers daily quests.
---
You are basicaly right.
---
Basic backpack have +60lbs
---
carry capacity have +60lbs
---
rest have +30lbs
---
Insulated +90enery resist
---
Lead +90rad rezist
---
refrigrator +60% slower spoinling don't stack with something with salt perk (which is 90%)
---
armored +90 ~~all resist~~ Balistic rezist
---
improved carry -60energy -60rad resist
---
I never get things like this.
---
&gt;. If it’s not your card and your money then the least you can do is use a few stim packs while being conduit. ( I thought the rate of people willing to take a pylon would increase as it is part of the opossum challenge) you’re already there getting a free legendary kill, show some effort.
---
Not everyone has a ton of stimpacks, especially low level characters, who might still be struggling to keep enough for themselves
---
&gt;Finally for the love of god, please, please, please, stop running away from the sheepsquatch, it’s going to kill you. You’re better off side stepping in a circle, you’ll stay alive longer, and the real high dps melee people won’t have to waste so much time trying to chase it down because you’re scared of respawning
---
No, its not going to kill you if you run fast enough.  Its easy enough to even get it to lose you if you're a stealth build as long as you put some distance on it. Melee are always going to have to chase their targets, that's the trade off for doing damage with no ammo cost, get over it. The whole idea of "I do more damage than you, my life is worth more" is really distasteful IMO.  Also, telling people to let themselves die to benefit you is a bizarre thing to me, I don't know how it would make sense to be playing an rpg and have your character throw their life away so some ass hat who doesn't want to run around can have an easier time.
---
&gt;Honestly, if you’re not going to at least take a pylon, don’t show up.
---
Get over yourself man. I don't get this type of entitlement. Its a public event, not only do you have no right to tell people how to play, but even less of one to tell them where to go. I get it, you spent caps and time spawning the event, you and your friends builds are so good that you don't need the help of more casual players, and its harder when other people show up. However, its disgusting that you're so self centered as to tell people to not join  a public even  because you don't think they're "Good enough" or "contributing enough"
---
The top post in this thread is about how these events make the community are a bunch of assholes. I have a different take. Posts like this show how *some* players so violently hate having to help others that the idea of having to "carry" less talented or knowledgeable players is so upsetting their willing to make posts on reddit and act like they're a victim and its a really bad look for the community.
---
Finally, a gentle reminder that a majority of players are very casual, 1-4 hours per day is the average play session length. While you know the ins and outs of how events like this work, many may not, and not understand that their presence is negatively effecting the outcome of the event. Lots of casual players don't understand that in some events, the number of players increases the difficulty, damage + energy resist, and **THE GAME NEVER TELLS YOU THIS OR HOW IT WORKS.** That same very casual demographic, the majority of players, never come to reddit, so you're really just chastising people who already probably help properly.
---
Edit: Grammar
---
Now do them all again on an alt since it's not account wide. 😉
---
Normally people stop with the “my uncle works at Nintendo” thing by the time they hit double digits, fyi.
---
lol I'm dumb did the same mistaken
---
Yeah, ask on the trading subreddits you’ll have a better chance at buying it there. It’s well worth the cap investment though it was my main outfit for a good few months.
---
They are from last week.
---
Did it end up being the tactical helmet?
---
True  to get rude nessages daily
---
Which one would you recommend? I’m new to reddit lol
---
This is great info thank you!  Where does the event usually show up at?
---
False advertising applies to a very narrow and specific band of failures to deliver.
---
So no. That doesn’t mean they did not lie and deceive, it just means they did not do so in the very few ways that are civilly liable.
---
This. If she doesnt take you all the way out dont respawn immediately when holding any pylons, little extra time for the team
---
I’m on PS4 and interested in these achievements: @booddha666! 
---
Help me help you!
---
sorry man I didnt had a chance to look RL got on the way, but I havent forgot you. I got you today. and if I do have it its yours.
---
I think the first cranberry one is a default one, but the higher % is from a recipe I think? Either way, good advice. It all helps!
---
I'll have to check it out. Just wanna get this character up quickly hehe
---
I heard it's a glitch hopefully they dont fix anytime soon! Haha haha but i did it like 10 times today and it didn't give me any badges .. Heard it has a 25% drop rate..????
---
Should’ve mentioned that I do have that. So I’m guessing they just take a lot of budget, then.
---
You get hands regularly.  You don't get hides because they aren't in the loot table for Deathclaws.
---
Cooking station anyone?
---
Yes. I have seen him once each of the past 2 days at WS.
---
armor plated is just +90DR, not all resists.
---
Easy enough to combat the switching: bobblehead is destroyed when unequipped. That mechanic already exists for mods.
---
We've dubbed them "snakybois".
---
CHALLENGES NOT CHORES!
---
It’s at Camp Adams at night.
---
Same. I'll never understand this kind of thinking. Unfortunately, a lot of the most active players have this sort of mentality. It's just children who weren't taught decent manners IMO.
---
Its fair, the game doesn't tell you most of the important bits.
---
Such a heartbreaking moment...
---
I almost never feel proud of myself, but when I got all 5 questions right in both quizzes related to my field of study on the first try, I was prancing around cocky as hell. I finally feel like my degrees are good for something. Thank you for showing me the way.
---
After serverhop i can kill wind and get XP. I can fight ghouls before they render, then i have to wait atleast minute for them to load. Original PS4 can be funny sometimes.
---
duping is bad but the ability to one shot each other is worse. need to nerf player damage to each other. also need to remove free trade and allow trading through vendors only, peeps complain about bethesda going pay to win with repair kits but we have dupers posting weps and armor for irl money . as long as players can trade with each other players are always going to sell stuff for real cash. I have been gaming since 1996 devs have been making the same screw ups since 1996, gold farming destroys any game economy and all games are pay to win if players are allowed to trade with each other. Guild wars 2 is the only one I have seen get it right. that being said I dont get upset it only matters if you try to be competitive.I get a lil cranky when I try to run a workbench and get one shot but I dont go out of my way to pvp. its too expensive.
---
Yeah it's a really low chance, I don't know the exact drop rate but it took me a while to farm them for the backpack mod.
---
You sure? There is writen 90dmg, not DR.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/nVGLrF3](https://imgur.com/a/nVGLrF3)
---
As someone who’s currently hurting for caps, I wouldn’t be complaining lol
---
It’s an amazing feeling when you actually get all of them right but good job glad to hear it went smooth for you!
---
Just because you're better geared than everyone else, doesn't entitle you to excluding those who aren't. You might want this, but no dev in their right mind would start letting players exclude each other in a game where the only new content are these events.
---
You was trying to dry snitch huh? You was mad lol
---
I don't see how it could be a bug. Event rewards have to be individually coded in so I doubt it. I have been getting one about every 6 or so events. Still easier than the dumba** challenges.
---
Today, at level 93, I learned that if you have the audio for effects turned up and are repairing a power plant at a workshop, you can hear the broken pipes hissing. 
---
I suspect I've missed many things in the game because I always listen to streaming music and have most audio settings turned down.
---
You click the report button. That's how that works.
---
Yet you are here..?
---
Yes, from the data files:
---
  EDID - Editor ID: mod\_BackPack\_Effect\_ArmorPlated
---
  FULL - Name: Armor-Plated
---
  DESC - Description: Lowered carry capacity. Increased damage resistance.
---
And in-game:

---
They need to change the tagging system. Everyone at the event should share the tag and that might slow down the frenetic running and gunning to get that tag before someone else one hits the mob.
---
Our Camp gun turrets share their mob tag with the Camp owner, so it should be  possible?
---
Much easier than the challenges, did one and said screw it and went to farming.
---
While it's possible, maybe even likely that they duped... it's just as likely that they killed a duper and picked that up or even found it after a duper dropped it at whitesprings. Nothing will happen unless you report them with real evidence of them in the act.
---
Will check it out thanks!
---
If i ever fast travel to camp and fall down from this thing, i will be mad.
---
Awesome thank you.
---
So 7 players with (statistically likely) duped weapons decided to shoot it out against each other and the match was eventually declared a draw...
---
...I find it amusingly ironic that you, one of the players from that match (with statistically likely duped weapons), has decided it necessary to come on here and bitch out Bethesda because they won't "do something" about the vast population of duped weapons. How about the person who choose to dupe the weapons and/or the player who chose to acquire said weapons shoulder a majority of the responsibility???
---
...nah... better to blame the corporation for their inability to "do something" rather than take even a sliver of personal responsibility for creating the situation in which the game currently resides.
---
Thx, good to know this.
---
OK so it's not just me. I always found them on Deathclaws before the update and exactly 0 since. Thanks Bethesda! The only reason I have 1/5 is I found one in the world somewhere but I have no clue where.
---
I get a a lot of screws off of super mutants it’s not guaranteed but it’s worth a shot
---
I haven't done the third yet and frankly ot doesn't look anywhere near as fun as the others.
---
is this legit?  I've only read luck as a contributing factor.  I'm only trying to learn, thanks.
---
Enclave bunker sells the recipe. Bring lots of caps
---
They are Aid
---
each bulk spring is 1 pound, meaning they can only have 800 in their stash legit. vending machines link directly to stash weight. so they are dramatically exceeding the normal limit
---
Works for me!
---
The only possible way to get recipes is to buy them from the enclave bunker. They used to rarely drop from the Scorchbeast Queen but they removed them from the loot table.
---
I read a few of them, thought to myself "why the f*** would I do that?" and just went to farming.
---
Ramps too.  I have a pair I can't scrap and remove.
---
Thanks for the reply! Since I don't know people that play fo76 I would mostly play alone. I do not like power armor and in the previous play I had some success with a rifle, for most fights, and shotgun for things that got too close. It would be great to be self sufficient. Is this enough to advise me?
---
In a perfect fallout game, taking workshops with pads like grafton and poseidon would let you own and fly a vertibird. Finally a real use for workshops and a fair way to balance vertibirds.
---
That explains why I haven't got them . Thanks for the response
---
Landview Lighthouse!
---
Bud, when you know a plan you no longer actually need the copy of the plan. Same goes for recipes and mods.
---
You realize that when you read a plan, it is consumed, and removed from your inventory right?
---
What?  Plans/recipes must be used to be learn. You can then get duplicates that are marked by having "(Known)" in front of name. Mods are one use thing that don't request plan or material to be placed on thing.
---
Speaking of NukaShine, I've got six ready to go when they reactivate punch bowls.  😉
---
It's going to be the train station near Berkeley Springs.
---
https://youtu.be/e9uCoF6O9fs
---
I tested this with my mule.
---
Didn't work.  The Broken ones can't be stored into a world container :(
---
Best thing I could do was find the tourist (found at the 4th location, teapot) and have my mule chars re-join onto my main to loot Ansel.
---
Hmmm. I didn't really think about that however is a stash box weight bug what you are angry about then? Why on earth would anyone care that someone else is holding more stuff in their stash? I understand hating duplication but someone else holding a ton in their stash doesnt affect you or anyone else at all, and dont try to make the arguement that it affect server stability because the servers have had about the same performance as when people had infinite stashes.
---
While were here, has anyone noticed not getting the right amount of caps when someone buys your 1 cap ammo?
---
I'm not 100% sure,  but someone thinks that only 10% goes to you and 90% gets cut. I feel like the numbers don't add up when I make an ammo sale, but I'm not sure what's going on exactly.
---
I like that idea but I also like the workbenches there because it looks so cool!
---
Pure dmg mitigation perks are more important
---
Grafton steel, shoot mutants, loot, check for rare plan at the spawn. Repair, server hop, repeat.
---
Na.... I've not played fallout since the first one 10 years ago.  I had no idea.  🤦
---
It's Skyrim apocalypse not Ghost Recon
---
Shepard's staff. There's an electric mod and plan I believe.
---
Or the Chinese officer sword.
---
Selling them all for 1 cap.  !!!
---
Other people have equal gear now I’m not winning all the time. Boohoo! Come on buddy you had me until you started the whine-fest.
---
Well we usually have a guy with axe in front and 20 people with tesla, as soon as the bloted show up everyone shots, the tesla sparks and we get loot. Exceptions are the 3 star where we all wait with the kill being imortant. Tesla will give you about 80% hit rate in a large cluster, a double shot tesla will give about 90%, you miss 1 in 10 but hey it's pretty good
---
 I have the perk for vendor price fully ranked and still they asked for 18500 caps! 
---
 Spent some time, but i got the marsupial for free!
---
Yes that’s exactly what your post is! Now other people have good gear. Oh no the game isn’t fun anymore!!
---
I'm not sure there's anything that you can do with no points in Makeshift Warrior. IIRC the Baton's pretty easy (and Electrified is a scrap mod), but you still need a couple of points.
---
Yeah, that's the one I mentioned. That's definitely where they will be?
---
And dupe em! :D /j
---
It's not lore friendly
---
What makes you say that?
---
In nearly 500hrs I've never come across dogwood, until now I didn't even know it was an item in the game lol
---
I think it’s because people want “realism” in the sense that you can only speak out loud or express yourself with actions, if that’s the case its a stupid reason because consoles already have it and it just limits the game, severely. I just want a local or private chat option, not global.
---
Also if people want realism, they’re playing the wrong game lol.
---
Given how the game is going (like the upcoming battle royal) I expect it to be a wasteland tinder
---
So then why does every camp have so many Plans for sale so soon after the PvP vending update. 
---
You'd think with the stash crunch they'd have gotten rid of the weight.  
---
Also I visited like 50 camps to find the brick walls plan to no avail.  Like nobody wants to sell this valuable weight. ?????
---
Removed, I just noticed the player name scribbled out, lol
---
Robot was in the background, assumed a vendy bot
---
There's no real reason NOT to have such a chat. I use such a chat in ESO and I like it. It's a quality of life improvement that will actually make hearing impaired players enjoy the game a lot more 😃
---
Oh. Got ya.
---
Do you have any way currently of telling if any of those are exclusive to choosing "Mama's Picks" as your buy option vs 3\*ranged or 3\* armor etc?
---
Ill get naked for caps ;)
---
Guess I'll buy the plan at a vendor just thought to keep the wealth in the community
---
Yeah I just remembered the baton one. Looks like I’ll have to level up a few times
---
Gah, didn’t even think about that. I know it does that for fallout 4 but I question if it does it for 76 cause I have a few figurines I’ve collected for when we can display stuff that haven’t been autoscrapped and I think they are steel which I run out of a lot. But maybe I’m wrong on that. I’ll have to check.
---
I believe it’s the ski poles if not it’s something to do with the sling items
---
It’s happening, don’t let losers get to you. Nothing can stop it, we will have them by 3rd dlc wave
---
I sell legendary weapons, armor, and ammo cheap. I still have a bunch of players that come up to my camp to buy stuff. I'm on ps4 Idk how the other systems are
---
you can play and use whatever you want, it doesnt have to be the meta.
---
300+ hours and im still using my all rise.
---
So my mega sloth finally died and OMG you can't tame them ever again?! WHY??
---
Said to bring lots of caps ;)
---
If it's "consumed and removed from my inventory" how can I sell a plan that's been eaten
---
Deathclaw are still tameable right?
---
it is performing exploits, having that many spring bulks could mean someone is performing one of the many dupe glitches as well as bypassing stash limits to make them all fit. 
---
personally i'm not angry about it. i'm just stating its a bit of a red flag for a potential exploiter.
---
Most likely, people have glitched inside the building and the shop is already set up, just without the Purveyor herself.
---
I want them. I would like to see each faction bos enclave etc, get reinforcements from elsewhere. then you could get quests helping the newcomers find out what happened to their people, also you could set up legitimate faction based pvp and contested zones. would also be a good excuse to add maps, ie BOS roll in ask for help scuffling with raiders and get on a vertibird and go past appallachia to a new map. that sort of thing. I mean At 900 hours I would totally be down with a new maps and scenerio.
---
If the weight is .25 why the he'll would any one keep the plan in their inventory if the ability to build it is permanent
---
You’ve got to be kidding?! So alllllllll this time I’ve been running around getting dry kindling and failing the quest, THATS why? D’oh!
---
Edit: just done the quest.... aaaaaand COMPLETED! Thanks so much for the tip!
---
It’s worth it. The base one you get is ok.  It you can just craft  next best one after. My current one is 60 pounds no mods.
---
That was fixed in a previous patch so those shouldn't be buildable any more.
---
National Radio Array and and National Radio Research both have a lot of fans and typewriters, I can usually pull 19-23  screws per run from each of those places and about half that many gears
---
Yeah! 
---
More like bring the caps!
---
If your on PS4 I'll take them from you.
---
20 extra carry weight at level 20, 60 at level 50. With no mods, just the base version.
---
Aaaand the Music badge. I've tried playing CAMP and world instruments, even in the locations they tell you to go, and no Badge progress at all. I just discovered that DC's weren't dropping hides tonight as I was doing all other objectives and thought this would be easily left for the end. I'm at 6/8 Possum badges with only 1 objective left in Leather and Metal worker left and I was feeling so close... But then Silver Extractors are giving me Scrap instead of Ore and now this. Bethesda Please! lol
---
when you bring new content bug free and fix your current bugs then maybe we can talk about paying for DLCs but right now is a NO.
---
Oh can you upgrade the weight via mods?
---
Yes, but you buy the mods with Tadpole/Possum points.
---
 I got the +60 carry weight too. It’s worth it as long as you want this extra carry weight, right?! 
---
 Depending on the Tadpole you’re doing, but i had some fun!
---
I chose to get 30 carry 90 damage resistance mod.
---
Personally, I’m hoping for a legendary flare gun...
---
I solo as well. My build consists have lots of strength, perception, intelligence and agility for the most part. If you're into rifles than stealth is viable and fun. You'll want to use your agility for stealth and adrenaline. Perception for either rifleman or commando, depending on if you want automatic or sniper. Lots of strength and intelligence will help you your carry weight and spec'ing into power armor for nuke zones. I know you said you don't like PA, but having the option open for SBQ fights and nuke zone stuff is really nice. For non-PA gear Unyielding works good for rifles, but Bolstering, Chameleon or Vanguard armor are all viable. It's just a matter of figuring out what style you like the most, and you can mix and match all these types. Personally I use a mixture Unyielding and Chameleon. If you're like me you'll want to hoard ammo, so Bandolier and Batteries Included are a must. Radicool if you are using Bloodied weapons and as much Adrenaline as you can afford. You'll want Marsupial, Adrenal Reaction, Speed Demon and Bird Bones at the very least, and Starched Genes with Class Freak in luck for mutations. 
---
This is just all my suggestions based on what my build turned into. I encourage you to adapt your build as you see fit.
---
Oh fair enough sounds pretty easyish does the backpack still show with armor like the trapper that has a backpack in it already?
---
Get a mic ya bum
---
If your outfit has a backpack it overrides the pioneer scout skin ... except BoS engineer.
---
This won’t adress to the human NPC topic, but hopefully to your last sentence: 
---
 Do you know about Nuclear Winter patch? 
---
 I heard they prepared a whole new set of quests, like a new scenario! 
---
 https://www.gamesradar.com/amp/fallout-76-roadmap-reveals-prestiging-nuclear-winter-mode-and-more-all-coming-this-year/
---
I have concrete for sale right next to a concrete extractor... people always go for the free shit because a small bounty is nothing compared to what they'd have to pay. It's too bad you can't place your vending machine outside of your camp
---
 New Morgantown airport upstairs.  Keycard is downstairs in the dead chicks right hand.
---
I have one...
---
I might be miss remembering but I thought that a "Bulldoze" feature was suppose to come with that CAMP update a while ago. So you could remove trees rocks and bushes to clean up your land, because for some reason there are still random rocks and trees that dont move when placing CAMPS.
---
It was planned for next week and they got it done early, so Thursday it is.
---
Mega Sloths are untameable... I have 3 points in both perks and that was my fave pet. My last one just died and I tried to tame a new one and nope. I also couldn't pacify a mirelurk king, wtf?
---
Baton, Chinese Sword, Revolutionary Sword. Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, Assaultron Blade and hatchet from the top of my head. You can find these mods in Vendors now so you won't need perks to equip
---
&gt;on't believe you can tame albino deathclaws
---
Can someone confirm that you can still tame deathclaws?
---
This guy didnt make the comment. I did. But this confirms that youre a brainlet
---
Place the rug on level'ish dirt, place purifier so it overlaps the rug. Then try to pickup the rug.
---
If the purifier also gets picked up, it's working!
---
Then you can blueprint them for future use.
---
Fiddle with it until you have a blueprint where the purifier doesn't stick out below the rug, otherwise it won't fit on flat surfaces like foundations, floors etc.
---
This works with anything, really: food crops, windmills, etc.
---
When you go to place the blueprint you have to place it in dirt, then afterwards you can pickup the rug and place it anywhere.
---
Easiest with the small square rug, but it works with any of them.
---
You can also build a staircase on a foundation and an iron pillar on the staircase. Then you blueprint the staircase and pillar, but not the foundations.
---
Now you can place the blueprint anywhere in the air, like literally floating 100ft up and build from there.
---
I like to use it for aligning to other buildings, and then building down to the ground from there as it's much easier to align it that way.
---
No, you're wrong you most definitely can stack foundations now that all they need is to be snapped to other foundations. I have a bunker built this way post patch.
---
It's worth it. It is so good to have that extra carry weight.
---
I was once excited for this game and subscribed.. forgot to unsubscribe to be honest. Then I saw this post and LOL'd because 76 is such a bad game compared to even fortnite.
---
Borderlands 2 is better than 76, and BL3 is what you should all be excited for.
---
Like I said I was once excited for 76.. but let's be real. It was a disappointment to say the least. After playing BL2 all the way through, fallout feels like a cheap knockoff.
---
Oh ok cool
---
Oh ok I might work on the challenges whilst helping my noob friend traverse Appalachia
---
It’s possible to gain multiples of the same plan/recipe
---
Btw i think the youtuber Oxhorn Sells loads of stuff like this: pillows Tshirts etc etc
---
Which one was that?
---
So Betheada still has terrible weapon balance in FO76? I'm also guessing the perk system is also just as jacked up. Yea that's the reason I stopped playing...
---
Just put the foundations back, then you can delete the ramps
---
They're pretty much 180'ing everything they told us before launch so far which is fine by me. "No pvp servers until November 2019", "no battle royale" "no human npcs" etc etc.
---
Good times.
---
It's too bad there aren't many xbox gamers. I have 2 .50 cal LMG's. 4 'The Dragon' black powder rifles, 1 Alien Blaster, and about 500 of nearly every material available for sale. Oh and like 20 fusion cores. A few bobbleheads, a few supply requisitions, 36 missiles, a bucket load of straight jackets, and too many maps to count.
---
My Explosive Double Capacity LMG does fine with my pre-TSE nerf build, since they gave heavy weapons a buff. 89 damage per shot with such a ridiculous fire rate means you can still melt practically anything in less than two seconds (except Scorchbeasts). Rank 3 Tenderizer helps a lot too.
---
Yup same. I don't mind the difficulty at all.
---
Idk I thought it kinda sucked, they need to put in a lot more effort for Halloween than have some robots walk around in costumes while I fight ghouls and pick up candy from plastic pumpkins.
---
And a set of interior walls? I'd like the plain white side of the brick set in both sides.
---
I have 4/5 vanguard pieces of bos heavy combat armor, armored backpack (+91), prisoner collar, helmet, outfit, max barbarian (+40dr), evasive perk 30/45 possible dr im working on. 
---
Im at 629, 494, 4. Once im done itll be higher. I like feeling tanky and i think bloodied mechanics are exploitive so this feels nice.
---
Rifles break, but my gatling laser lasts for a week
---
its just a weekend's worth of content in a game that needs more mechanisms to put players together more than anything else. 
---
I think they could work well as components of a fleshed out faction system tho, as a lot of folks mention. It just seems like a natural way for 76 to develop.
---
120 carry weight at max (-60 rad and energy rezistance as balance thing, but i have tones radaways anyway a energy damage is super weak, that's why BoS is dead)
---
Easy to get, I don’t dupe
---
it's a proximity thing, and a really small one at that.
---
As a melee character I often end up blocking the shots of people who are in party and are actively contributing, they shouldn't be punished because I have a big hit box.
---
Battle royale? Wtf
---
 So use that. I am generous to those that have their ears on. I will not deal with those that don't.
---
Yup. There are a lot of "SUREFIRE" tips that just...aren't.
---
I've been playing since BETA, using mods since launch. No bans yet
---
Yes.  People who, unlike almost every person in this thread, have a sense of humour.
---
Hey. I’m late to the party. When you shut down the power and it gives you a 2:00 countdown. Where do you go? The only door I can’t get through asks for a terminal but I can’t find a computer to open it. I’ve been everywhere! Seen the two computers in the reactor room too but they are not it. I’m 55lvl and have no problem clearing the bots. Just where to go. 🤔
---
theres also a castle at berkley sprongs, a legite whitesprings, and even the temple of the winding path. most of the map is based off of real world locations just like the commonwealth in fallout 4,
---
Personally, I liked Southern California, the setting for the first Fallout game, the most.
---
As for locations that haven't been games yet, I wouldn't mind a Fallout: New York. It's a big state, and even New York City itself is quite large with all of its boroughs, so even if there were nuclear strikes there (and they've only been mentioned in the Bible, and not in games as far as I know, so it's arguable how canon that information even is), I'm sure it could still make for an interesting zone to explore.
---
Fallout: Maine might also be fun, with some Stephen King horror elements.
---
Nah, it just means someone was in that map cell recently and did it. Keep trying, you'll get a fresh one eventually
---
Cool! I'll let you know once I've had the chance to map them out
---
Tried that, but it didn't work.
---
However, I'll give it another try, see if I can't get them to disappear.
---
If I understand you correctly, your argument is that because some enemies have lower ER than DR, energy weapon's don't need ER penetration from perks. But the opposite also holds true - some enemies have more DR than ER. So why do ballistic weapons get DR penetration but energy weapons don't? If you wanted to use that argument - that we should memorize all the enemy DR / ER values, or use the awareness perk card to see them,  and always pull out the appropriate weapon for the appropriate enemy, then no weapon should have armor penetration and we should all just carry multiple weapons - at least 1 weapon that deals each type of damage (even melee, could carry a shishkebab I suppose which does high amounts of energy damage).
---
I'm really not a fan of the 'rock paper scissors' approach to enemy resistances. It's OK for RP purposes, but it completely craps on balance and it's not fun IMO. Look at WoW - in vanilla, the first big raid (Molten Core) most of the mobs were heavily resistant to fire, making any class that did fire damage as a main part of their build useless. If you wanted to go as a mage, you went as ice or arcane. That isn't good game design in my opinion. It's also very punishing to rifle users since they'd have to carry several heavy rifle weapons with on weapon weight reduction perk.
---
I'm not gonna lie, it also just irks me that these supposedly "most advanced weapons" that our military could create, were in fact inferior to the tried and true standard weapons.
---
Well, makes sense
---
I feel like this is how the participation trophy idea started...

Laser rifles should be the quintessential sci-fi weapon. Yet nobody uses them. In the original Fallout, laser and plasma weapons were some of the end-all, be-all weapons, yet they've never been great in Bethesda's game. Plasma only recently got a buff that makes it fairly decent, but even then, it's still not quite great. 
---
I feel like Bethesda decided laser and plasma were too futuristic for their games and nerfed to focus on the more retro feel of the series. They're not worthless, but they're really just not great.
---
shhh... don't give them ideas.
---
Yea the whole map is based on west virginia pretty similar actually, scaled down of course. I got to walk through my grandmothers home town on there. Unfortunately they dont have my town but hey whatll you do lol
---
Grabbed a few tonight, thanks. Any chance you have a AA lever rifle?
---
If it makes you feel any better, I bought an AA 25% Gatling Laser for 10K caps like 3 months ago, been holding onto it forever in the hopes that some day it's worthwhile.
---
Why wouldn't NPCs be lore friendly?
---
I want human npc's. One of the main reason I like fallout is there is an underlying hope to it all, you see people building their lives. We are rebuilding Appalachia, if they were to introduce them I think it would help show the progress we've made. That's just my two cents.
---
There is a dead policeman behind a crack in the wall...it seems to me he is holding something in the hand...
---
Cheers! Great advice! I'll look into the perks you mentioned and see where the roads take me!
---
On PS4 I get a lot of reactions to my camp. I built it on an in-game underground bunker type thing in the Mire. 
---
People often chill out on the couches for awhile or play an instrument. 
---
It also sometimes seems like they're buying something more to give a tip vs actually needing it
---
The patch came out a week ago, so that's 2 weeks it's broken instead of 3.
---
Also if you come across the flatwoods monster, a wendigo, or the sheepsquatch stuff. Thats all real life stuff as well.
---
If you have a friend go to the swimming test area and a little further down is a cave in the water with one of the pointy floor traps that you can build in your camp, but it's in shallow water. Walk over it till you go down, rinse and repeat with friend.
---
The story of fallout 76 is everyone died to the bombs except vault 76 residents.
---
Dang. lol. Idk why it can't just negate ER 😂
---
There are quite a few weapons that are viable end game. I wouldn't even say energy weapons are unusable, but you have to accept a pretty severe dps penalty with no real benefit. Pistols are the only class of weapons that just don't really cut it.
---
I actually like the perks system. It's a lot closer to Fallout 3 / New Vegas than what Fallout 4 is, and it allows you to swap out perk cards when needed. I've been able to work out good builds for melee, heavy weapons, rifles, and shotguns, and they're all fun viable end game builds. In all fairness though, nothing really comes close to my Bloodied Heavy Weapons .50 cal build for sustained dps.
---
Mine is +30 carry weight, but it’s +90 DR. Inventory management hasn’t been a problem for me, so I went for the armor mod. Definitely worth it. Just need more skins now.
---
Why not ask for both.?  Anything the merchandising section does isn't going to delay the Devs from thinking up more ways of unintentionally adding more bugs to the game.
---
Sorry, wrong forum.

Who is this commie scum that's selling this tool of propaganda? Trying to humanise the Red Menace and install their listening devices throughout Appalachia. 
---
All these propapanda bears should be round up and destroyed. That's the patriotic thing to do!
---
Yes...... hence the ( quantity )  notations.  
---
But the question is does it count towards your weight budget. That I will have to look at. 
---
Still I have to ask why have we all been running around with 20+ points of weight this whole time if we could drop the plan once it's been "read". 
---
 I just read a post that a player had been ( previous to the new vending update ) droping his "read" ( learned ) plans at the 1st overseers stash box .. That's awesome wish I would have found that!!!!

I really want to make a crazy wendigo build and I probably will in the summer

---
This phenomenon happens in every single game though. Head over to the regular Fallout sub and you'll see "Is Fallout 1/2/3/4/New Vegas worth playing?" posts quite a bit. Every single gaming sub has these posts, sadly.
---
There are many Power Armor stations all over the map. Especially now with player-vending - most player shops have all crafting stations available.
---
I wouldn’t recommend spending 500 caps on this plan if it’s 1/3 of your capital.  You will likely do the excavator armor quest and get it for free.
---
Terra forming would be great
---
It's not that I don't want them, it's that I don't really think it matters. They're all synths anyway.
---
No, I don't, sorry.
---
Don't think, just consume product.
---
Fallout: Chicago
---
Specifically bos heavy combat armor ones.
---
What about people who made their own successful bunkers though? The ones that possibly got mutated but not killed by the bombs?
---
Uhh yeah nah mate. Many, many people survived outside of the vaults. How else would any of the factions form by the time our vault opened??
---
I found the coat! It was in the prison
---
Yeah your right I found it in prison
---
How is calling a box mysterious hinting at a dlc?
---
I can never get those, but the ones at the Free Range seem to work.
---
What I meant is that all the people not in vaults died when the bombs came and the rest of the survivors underground emerged, created factions and got consumed by the scorched plague years later.
---
I specifically hate the battle royal genre an all that it stands for. Of course its probably because i usually play gamemodes like deathmatch with preset loadouts. It pretty much cuts out the "looting for weapon" time and the potential for trash RnG, and puts more focus on hunting players. Though that's my opinion.  If fo76 did add a battle royal mode it would probably make sense only if it was something the raider faction did for fun and end up more like a pvp arena at best. That's if bethesda wanted to stick to the theme of fo76 since it's whole plot is rebuilding america and defeating the hostile mutants of the wasteland like the scorched. The Survival mode was implemented in a weird way because at first it was more of a poorly balanced leaderboard centered deathmatch full of people wanting to steal everyones caps to, most likely, spend on overpriced god level legendaries. Now it looks to be a harsher adventure mode where you hope that your buddy Steve from the vault hasn't gone crazy for some reason and tries kill you. As for fo76 having any parts of itself f2p its most likely going to be a VERY long time before that happens unless its a last resort to get more people playing.
---
Nah, this is when you think it could be easier to start a whole new character than to respec to get your points sorted correctly.

Usually he spawns at thunder mountain but look out for brotherhood chapters as it was under brotherhood control

Ad Victoriam
---
The only solution is perma ban and completely deleting all duped items. Until then it will continue to be a mess and all their hard work put into improving the game get eaten by parasites immediately.
---
Clipboards in the army camp thing with obsticle course.  Tons of them there, like 40.  I think they are springs though?
---
That was class :p
---
Or use vampire gun go far away and aim robots
---
Wow, I actually finished the nuke one. I think this player crashed or something while in power armor and was just standing there naked and idle without dying forever for me. Another player I talked to on voice wasn't able to see her. Anyways I took her pic and it worked :v

Thanks bugged [stranger](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/330511405264535552/577744768122224651/unknown.png).
---
I'm not sure how you came to that, but it's one theory on what people want.
---
Because you might have different ones than other people, so you list the ones you have that are more rare, so people can buy them if they don't already know them.
---
Nah, that workshop is essential for after a nuke run and you're over encumbered, scrap, make flux, make ammo, cook all the glowing meat, etc.
---
SPOILERS
---
There’s quite a few references in game that suggest a bunch of people evacuated rather than died. I suppose at the very least those people could return. 
---
BOS died to the last soldier but could in theory be reinforced by external branches though this would be far fetched.
---
Enclave completely wiped out by their own computers. Other branches already hunkered down or living large on the oil rig.
---
It may be the only survivors were responders and/or raiders that had folks actually get out who could return. All the big hitter characters are dead as we can find their bodies, so it’d be new characters.
---
Edit: just re-read and you said they died to the bombs, but there were loads of survivors. They were subsequently wiped out by the ‘scorched plague’.
---
Robots.
---
It might get balance with energy dlc or sth.
---
It's another distraction. The only reason I would want a text chat is to make it more accessible to players who are deaf or partially deaf, or those who can't communicate with the microphone. Many games have captions so deaf players don't miss out on the dialogue so why not have text chat?
---
I am ok with chat if it comes with proximity restriction. A global chat will be nothing but a cesspool.
---
But not everybody died. Nukes are surprisingly survivable within the fallout universe according to lore, such as the survivalist from New Vegas. It's like a solid week you've gotta wait for the radiation levels to dip, especially in an area such as the Appalachia where they didn't get hit as hard. Also if we look back to Fallout 3 we can see the nukes weren't of the strongest power, as the buildings around the white house are still standing, while the whitehouse itself is not.
---
Blue prints NEVER work. Well they do but they cannot be complicated.

I have 50 weapons and 50 bits of armor in my shop. If i sometimes go afk while people shop I have no clue whats being bought/sold. I want to know whats popular without having to manually try track sales.

I'm playing at 4k and the game does look pretty nice, but the long range rendering is pap. If you stand on Seneca Rocks and look around the stuff on the ground is drawn in low poly mode!
---
I’ll be your guys’ power leveler. 120 melee Assassin at your service, oh great clean leader. What’s our guild’s name ?
---
Pretty simple fallout player have been single player gamer before 76 meaning they don't care for multiplayer and pvp. And if you go on survival it lacking in player only a couple servers.
---
Not saying pvp should get no love but this games player base is not into pvp. The big focus should be into making the pve and endgame better not giving us another mode that few will play.
---
Pretty sure that Personal Terminals are instanced. The Atomic Shop’s description does say that the terminal is able to “Connect with other Wastelanders”, so I guess we’ll see that type of feature in a future update.
---
Uh, no one does this. We drop junk plans, we only keep rare plans in case someone wants to buy it.

Not everybody can put a 5 hour session in every day.

Go to Blackwater mine for gears,mike miners drop suit scrap which contain a gear each and from one trip u can rack up about 30 steel and also a good source of aluminium. And for screws maybe check Lower level areas aswell, maybe the herald and the hornwright hq
---
I was unable to even pacify a mirelurk king today have you tried since the patch?

Bro I would pay good money to have a pet rock.

Oh hello   .. So you guys all play in a team ?

It’s at camp venture, it’s a very bare bones course as you have a minute to complete it and can finish with 15 seconds remaining.

That's awesome, i need to test this! 
---
Heat seaking 40mm grenades xD
---
Flip lighters are a really good resource for screws and are often dropped by Ghouls. I regularly farm Whitesprings and have found myself with far more than I need!
---
As for gears and further screws the best place to farm is Sugar Grove in the savage divide. The place is abundant with clipboards, typewriters, office desk fans and antique globes. Also the national satellite array nearby is pretty decent for farming these resources.
---
I hope this helps and happy hunting!

---
The fact you need a specialized build just for the weapon to simply *exist* is the very issue, and then even when it exists its damage is significantly smaller than regular ballistics. Secondly, those solutions don't answer the problem at all. I could literally still use a completely different gun and get the same benefits and significantly moreso.
---
[My Furious Laser Rifle does 55](https://puu.sh/Ds5mA/370bc5e791.png) to my [nonlegendary handmade's 86.](https://puu.sh/Ds5ng/f18ca1844f.png)
---
The difference is its a bigger pain in the ass to repair the laser, the laser rifle breaks sooner, the laser rifle has no defense penetration properties whatsoever, has no damage enhancing receiver, and there's more difficulty feeding it ammunition.
---
Even after the durability buff there is almost 0 incentive to use Laser Weapons.
---
On the plus side, Plasma weapons at least feel decent, but that's almost assuredly because they do split damage and energy resist of any value in this game completely shuts down energy, so Plasma at least deals some physical damage. Even then, Plasma still feels outdone by ballistics as well.
---
As far as rifles go energy is a complete waste of time.
---
EDIT : I swapped builds mid way through. Laser rifle actually does 69, which is still such a downgrade, especially when considering the lack of penetrative properties.
---
If they could go up to level 50 that would be interesting to see
---
All I have in my CAMP vendor is mutation serums. I think I've sold 2. O.o
---
It’d bring more people into the game so I think they should do it—- but it should also coincide with a real Shake up in the game; there are still more problems to be addressed besides just NpCs
---
Even if it brings in new players we still need to keep them
---
You clearly have no idea how radios work.
---
They fixed it. Only the first opening of the safe yields the quest rewards. And let's be honest, it was an exploit, that should've been fixed sooner.
---
That. Was. Amazing.
---
Previously the perk I wanted fucking most was not to have to click FT 164849394726 times because there is a fucking molerat somewhere else. I've been posting things like let level 200 people FT while theres a level 3 bloatfly nearby. I've been writing posts like please remove all fucking rats because by now I hate em so much I singlehandedly turned the forest into glowing sea to get rid of them.
---
I find the current solution infinitely less infuriating than previous one.
---
The base one is worth it for sure. I'm not really worried about grinding the mods.
---
It repeats every night just like Sons of Dane, Winding Path, etc.
---
You can grind the quest, keep your CAMP shop open, and even complete challenges all without hopping. Unless you really want to hop.
---
For screws I recommend running through the 5 bunkers in the mire (Abbie, Ella, abandoned, Carson and Raleigh clay), the shops in Wavy Willard’s (lots of toy cars), sugar grove obviously and WV lumber co sometimes has a few. I don’t really know where to look for gears since I’ve always had an excess of them sorry :(
---
If it's not f2p then yes I agree with you, if it is f2p then no, the player base will not be split. Save the world players (of Fortnite) would likely say the same thing about not wanting a br mode and if epic made you p2p it would have failed. but allowing people customization of characters In a f2p br mode it brings in good $. It'would be a less serious more profitable route for them IMO.
---
Do you still earn perk cards after 50?
---
😂😂😂
---
on the pipboy they are under aid, but if you're looking at a camp on the map they're under misc(saw somebody else saying this here)
---
if you're on xbox i have some serums in my shop, gt renawana
---
Open fallout76.ini and look for the somethingarchieve2something which you all gotta copy and paste into fallout76custom.ini
---
You should do that after each update, or else stop using mods - pretty much it'll break each time there is new content
---
I still dislike how I can accidentally damage players when when I'm on Pacifist mode and that I can still be murdered by someone slapping me with their rifle. 🙄
---
*BIG IRON ON HIS HIIIIIIIIIIIIP*
---
I still haven't got camera, any tips on how you get one?
---
you dont need a foundation. you can use a perimeter wall frame. If you start your camp from scratch, you can not place any walls at all, they are all blocked off unless you have a foundation or perimeter wall frame.
---
 If you were expecting something like the place anywhere mods of fallout 4... you're just stupid.
---
Lol!!!
---
I didn't know it was an exploit.  I thought that getting daily stimpaks was the reward for completing the quest.  That's too bad, but at least now I know to quit going back there.
---
to give them to others
---
There’s zero reason a Pipboy couldn’t receive RDS data.
---
Not sure, havent hit 51 yet. I think you get the choice of a card or moving a stat.
---
No, I already have a pet Mirelurk Hunter, so I don’t have a reason to attempt to tame anything. 
---
Are you using Wasteland Whisperer instead of Animal Friend?
---
Intelligence increasing damage is a really good idea actually.
---
Sure it can but it would mess with the old school radio vibe. It's like a brand thing for Fallout games now, something they really don't want to change.
---
Pass.. its just a lvl 35
---
I have 3 points in both and both equipped. I don't mean tame, can you even pacify any was my question. I tried but nope. That makes me think you won't be able to tame them anymore.
---
So hazmat = naked ?
---
If power armour is your thing, then it's probably worth it. Or you could head south east and do the quest. It gives you the plans for excavation armour.
---
Spawn protection sucks. I'm okay with it being given to a player for the first time they enter given respawn point with a 30 min cooldown.
---
But the whole fucking idea to be able to respawn and get onto better position to define moment at which you retaliate is even more stupid than people who keep respawning on contested station and complain they die, which by itself is almost infinitely stupid. 
---
Each mechanic that makes player cease doing damage end up same way - as a fucking abuse. I'm enemy of each of those mechanics and think that besides maybe Encryptid and SBQ events should not give you any protection too.
---
I thought it suited the content ;D
---
no it doesnt work like that , max skill points are at LVL 50, after that every time you lvl up you will have the choice to either pick a perk card or move a skill point.
---
after lvl 50 everyone has the same amount off skill points, I would suggest to work towards the build you want be becuase after lvl 50 it will take you twice as long to fix youe build.
---
If you’re on Xbox somehow I got another broken cam so I can craft you one if you’d like.

Scummy all caps moron.

I was in Power Armor, so I don't think it matters. Just take a pic of the deathclaw after a queen nuke and you are good!
---
You know we can see your post history and it's votes right?
---
No these are all very fine points and I neglect people who disagree with those as potential opponents in discussion, and in PvP they are meat too, super stupid.
---
But I love survival and calling it broken is how you get hunted. Its beta still.
---
you can still send text to someone in game it just uses xbox live message system but it still works the same.
---
Sometime the boss can wander to the very different spot, like I had once attend to an horde event to kill Yao Guai on the north of Watoga near the substation, but when I fast travel and arrived the event, nothing was on the compass, I wandered for a bit and found nothing, confused and opened my map, in the end the enemies are at the NAR Repair Yard, which is south-east to the Watoga, I fast traveled to NAR since the event marker is on the north, killed the boss, I was surprise the event didn't said I was leaving though, although I'm not sure if the horde event even have such mechanism also

I kind of liked the colours of 3 and nv, gave the game a grim look to it. fallout 4 and 76 doesn’t really feel like a wasteland to me. All of them are super fun games though. That’s not enough to make me not wanna play just enough to make me want to go back and play those older games again every once in a while. I have them all installed on Xbox rn
---
No problem. I did the same exact thing when I installed my vending machine. 😆

Oh crap! Was that me? I'm so sorry if that was me. You can have an abraxo, 2x beers on the house and if you fancy, I'll even pop a vintage nukashine. Sorry!
---
Right now in PvP the recon scope mark is one of greatest possible advantages. If it also showed up for targets that are actively gaming, good bye using your eyes to locate your frags.
---
all you need is to be in a team.
---
Because you are a tank that means you should be just as much an ass as the person you're complaining about? Alrighty then
---
Baught 3 just now
---
Yeah but, do you use any of the perks that increase durability?
---
Also, the rate of fire on a laser rifle seems a lot higher than that of a home made rifle. Thats something that also should be factored in.

I do agree that laser weapons need a look at, but my question was about the durability perks being the issue.
---
no these are the new ones that were solved tonight.
---
Okay thank you!
---
Only you see the renaming. It’s to prevent abuse, ie racism, sexism, etc.
---
I don’t keep either card equipped unless I am trying to tame.
---
You don’t always get the option to pacify, even on animals that are covered on the cards, and the patch notes explicitly state that Mirelurks are now covered under Wasteland Whisperer, so they can definitely be pacified at least. There is nothing I saw that said they can no longer be tamed.
---
You can repeat them, the dude even says how you're defending your title. Think you can do each once per day for rewards. Sure like the athletics guy a lot more than the swim instructor.
---
Interesting. I've always gotten the pacify option...
---
I think you’re confusing medium with media. 
---
In the FO universe, they lost the servers and network, but kept the IoT devices. Practically speaking, they have the iPhone, but no mp3’s or YouTube.
---
In other words, the reason all the music sounds like it came from the 50’s isn’t because culture or tech stopped in the 50’s. It’s that the only formats that survived the global EMP were the songs recorded and preserved in physical mediums prior to the digital revolution.
---
try serving hopping near the tables near the giant teapot, only took one hop to find the tourist there.
---
You're calling me stupid, and yet you've got 20+ minute videos "teaching" people how to do stuff that's been well known since beta.
---
This is amazing. Would you mind if I posted the maps on The Vault Fallout Wiki? It'd help a great deal, especially with hunting down the rarer items. 
---
I'm also wondering, is it possible for you to create spawn maps? Not the precise chances, but general locations where X might spawn, some of the weekly and daily challenges are, well, challenging because of that.
---
Check some of the data mining stuff on YouTube, like juice head etc
---
Every gun breaks so fast now. Bethesda just want you to buy repair kits now.
---
Oh yeah, that one.
---
Should stop Super Mutants from calling you names.
---
And when you fall through the ground for the fifth time in an hour, you get to go to unknown territory too.
---
Could easily see a lot of ni- you get it
---
Would be too easy to level new characters
---
I have all of those perks, it doesn't suddenly magically fix the gun, it still breaks far more frequently than a regular rifle, and with the regular handmade, I also don't even *need* to run those specific nuanced perks just to have the gun in my hands, so I was even able to reallocate the points to make the guns damage *even higher*.
---
There's a reason I named the weapon "Breaky McGee", and it revolves around the fact that the weapon is so bad it doesn't even *want* to exist.
---
Ahhh I gotcha. Makes sense I guess. It'd be nice if they could just censor certain words to get around that but its whatever. Thanks man 😂
---
What's a serum supposed to go for now? 750 was average and 500 was cheap uh.... a month or two ago...
---
Is this a challenge needed for a badge?
---
This would be really important for any event and temporarery event mates.
---
Plasmas are ok until you meet enemy with high resists... Then you put your legendary plasma  back to stash and pray to Todd that devs buff them. Lasers are hot trash. You need to take 5 days off work just to kill one supermutant.
---
Last thing we need is someone to change the prisoner collar to "African Necklace" 😂
---
I totally support you! I want this since the beginning of the game.
---
But is this game worth getting back into tho?
---
Jesus h christ
---
Agreed.
---
I'll keep that in mind
---
How do you find enough cores to feed it?
---
Oh wow. I actually love that
---
Never had that happen.
---
Do pioneers dailies and you will have them as reward
---
Pemmican recipe is not available however it (the pemmican itself) is a reward from the repeatables.
---
Trust me, I know. ;)
---
Plasma Flamer is fun, though. Plasma Rifle is definitely better than it used to be.
---
I can't believe the handmade is still the defacto ranged weapon. Why does it have no recoil and an energy weapon sends you to the roof? I guess they did that to make a reasonable firing rate? I don't get it.
---
dupe is a huge problem, but to say that the game is unplayble its just not true.
---
i see what you are trying to say, but it really comes a cross like you are mad becuase your OP weapons are every where and now you dont have to upper hand. in all you do have good points but you sound salty that you didnt win with your op weapons.
---
I would love to see a redo of the New Vegas environment. Maybe not the same game redone, but another shot of the region. The areas around the Grand Canyon offer some of the most diverse scenery in the country. 
---
Not just in vegetation, mind you. Every dozen mules or so the geology completely changes. In the Pariah region, just north of the Grand Canyon, the rocks dramatically change within a few hundred feet of each other. It’s nuts.
---
Here are a [few photos](https://puptrait.com/dog-photographer/rescue-pup-desert-adventure-at-white-pocket/) I took out west where New Vegas was held. Most of these shots were captured within 100meters of each other (except the first two, but those locations were still in New Vegas).
---
You don't need a plan for the brahmin, you just need whatever it takes to place, it razorgrain and whatever.
---
Dolly Sods bug quest. Do Campfire Tales first, collect all the big parts, turn in at Dolly Sods. Repeat.
---
It’s also possible things are just glitched. 
---
I’ll try to see if I can get it to work.
---
Haha I dont mind being hunted. The survival aspect is definitely broken, mainly the changes to PvP. I stand by the title.
---
   
---
I am asked in the archeology badge to prepare pemmican so the recipe must be in the game
---
Yeah I'd totally never do something so horrendously racist... Even though I'm black 😂
---
Finally, a reasonable person! Thank you!
---
Decimal pricing is better than bulking, because bulking requires plastic.
---
Same thing happened to me. I took pic of a honey beast with another power armored player in it and it popped.
---
Calling other people “amateur” implies the opposite of a paid professional. There are adults playing 76 who have real responsibilities more pressing that knowing exactly what to do when playing some minutia in a video game.
---
Let’s calm down a little, Captain Elite Video Game Bad Ass.
---
I would understand that plasma has recoil because it  actually shots matter. But laser? Its as stupid as if flashlight had recoil.
---
Merci je vais faire sa
---
Did you attack him back? Because if you don't, he can't kill you
---
It's called pipe gun.
---
Well the thing is you share the titling aesthetic with people responsible for posts like "I took worst possible tool against enemy whose build was made in order to negate this particular tool and it didn't worked, I have zero idea about how this game works but its broken" and this is the worst type of noob this community has.
---
Did you notice the holotape in the box? Maybe that has something to do with it? I hope I haven't blown your mind with space-time confusion
---
you apparently missed the memo cause none of these techniques arent used in your cliffside camp. I also found a post of yours where you roleplay someone who lost their memory and doesnt know how to make perfectly square foundations, and want walls without the use of foundations. 
---
take a look at those 20 min videos one more time and learn how to build your self standing walls.
---
however your cliffside camp contradicts your roleplay.
---
looking at your past post actually, you seem like the type of person that likes to complain about things instead of find a solution. A person like that, I call stupid.
---
He needs to be it needs to be unlocked in the C.A.M.P. menu under resources and it takes one razor grain and one steel
---
That looks like a pic straight out of doom. Lol.
---
unyielding is the way to go.
---
Enclave bunker for screw too. In room before command centre can be around 10 fans there, also a great place for technical data from all cabinets and desks.
---
Um..no. It looks 50's because that's what it looked like pre-war, as is evident from Fallout 4. Every decade had their "look and feel" in our world, and in the FO-verse the 50's look sorta persisted. Proof: the TV advertisements we see playing in the intros of Fallout 1 where there are ads for a Mr. Handy which most definitely was not a 50's technology, because why would a robot from the 50's be playing on a TV in a house in 2077? General Atomics and RobCo didn't exist in the 50's, so the advertisement must be from later. Same for the car and Super-Duper Mart ads. Yet these ads are in black and white and have WW2 era songs playing in the background. We see this in the Fallout 3 trailer as well. Also, we find physical holotapes and a B&amp;W TV in the house of the Sole Survivor on Oct 23, 2077. So clearly, a 50's era style was prevalent in the universe. While I really like your interpretation of the lore, it is most likely that the 50's style was created to give the game an Atom-punk look and therefore, technology is deliberately made to look old school.
---
I'm still receiving xp from cooking, few hours ago I lved up from it actually lol
---
The difference is, it doesnt matter who you are. Literally any person will suffer because of these exploits, therefore it is actually broken. I know how the game works, and some of these are new exploits discovered by some clever people.
---
How do you explain the popularity of the 10mm round?
---
Oh good!!! That's my bread and butter. Cook and sell.
---
yeah I have seen that, I go to camps if im close, but I think it has to do with the new content, everyone is trying to get that backpack, and if your are like me then you  are trying to get it before the next update. so my time is mainly doing the backpack and selling stuff. 
---
but even tho it has slowed down I still sell a few things here and there.
---
Where did you cook? I remember a patch changed how public unowned/not yours workshop crafting no longer giving XP.
---
He had workshops at level 30.
---
"Me know they gun add loot crates. No proof but me gun shout from rooftops anyways." That's you, that's what you're doing.
---
Same for me on the waterpark. Some of us probably are hitting the same servers over and over because the game population isnt high enough in our region.
---
I should admit, I never played FO 4. Everything I’m taking from the franchise is from playing FO, FO2, FO Tactics, FO3 and NV.
---
Mine, randoms, stations and another player's. And zip, zilch, nothing in any.
---
I thought they fixed that? I could've sworn it was mentioned in the patch notes
---
everytime I have done/seen the event is in the mire region closer to watoga.
---
If you were a die hard fallout fan you would be playing...
---
I'd pay Atoms for the pets rock.
---
Actually, I think it should not just you can inspect, it should just display outside without inspect just like this though: https://i.imgur.com/wnKb6B2.png
---
I had a mid-air floating half wall the stubbornly would not store or deconstruct. On a wild hunch I finally had my husband leave our team and shoot it until it was destroyed, which for some reason let me finally get rid of it. Try that.
---
If you have workshops, expect to get killed. There is no toxicity in this, it is the only viable means of PvP in the game right now outside of survival mode. When you take a workshop, you clearly get a message and you consent to PvP, so prepare for the consequences.
---
Also, this post breaks r/FO76 rules; no witch-hunting allowed. Not like the mods would notice anyway.
---
Eeeehhhh arguable....
---
Search for it onlinem thats what I do
---
Ballistic fibre can get 1-2 from every forward station around wataga also all army camps like McLintock by scrapping ammo bags and military duct tape. Think it was innosurvival that did a good farming guide on you tube worth a look.
---
Nah I know how to farm it, it’s just get annoying because early game I wasn’t looking out for it and now in end game I’m in need of it constantly, and I never made it a priority, ugh.
---
Well your analysis definitely put yourself in the position of being the most correct person that says survivals broken, as I said I think they all need to be fixed
---
I have a full time job *and* I don't just leach at boss events. Fuck me, right?
---
So much this. I ditched Hard Bargain and picked up 5 pieces of +1 charisma armour and the military fatigues with +1 charisma, and I'm getting 90% of the pricing of 2 points of hard bargain.  
---
BUT I keep forgetting to swap out my under armour and getting meh prices.
---
Go for it, they have the sub and my reddit on the watermark. I'm just concerned there is potential for errors still.
---
Mobs can't be mapped yet sadly
---
No its not. Its what 4 should have been. No weak ass story... No pointless dialog wheel. 
---
It is the meat and potatos of 4 to put it simply. No people are not griefing you (guessing your new to multiplayer games) in fact 95 out of 100 players you ignore you. You wave or call for help and they might come over to see you.
---
Its like dayz or gta but in the fallout universe. Still things to be hammerd out.. Sure but the updates keep coming and its fun as fuck. You decide.
---
Here's what happened he hit me and as he did his buddy took over our workshop and he was able to attack me and since his buddy was taking my workshop he continued to kill me
---
Broken ProSnap cameras rarely spawn in toolboxes now.
---
I need to be able to manually invert my walls. If I want the inside on the outside or the outside on the inside i should be able to do it.
---
Im not the OP, just some guy bored stuck on midnight shifts curiously following this thread if its actually ingame for consoles lol
---
No really since the game is trash and all Bethesda wanted was a cheap cash grab from there fanbase as they knew they had a large fan following. But this can be debated another time. 76 just made me lose all respect for Betheda and I feel sorry for all people that pre-ordered and sadly i was one of the people that pre-ordered. The reason I am not playing is because the only way we can combat this against devs like Bethesda is by simply not picking the game up/not playing it. I just wanted to be informed if the game has been improved or not since its launch as I seem to not be finding anything online to support this claim. I am not the only  1 who has stopped playing and is a die hard fan. You should know this my guy
---
Im not reading your wall of hate. If you dont want to play then dont.
---
Can we also get some stair variants, specifically full block stairs for nice stairwells, as well as corner stairs, and maybe even a spiral staircase. I find the logic for the default stairs to be quite stupid and placement is awkward
---
I genuinely didn't think that far into it to be fair I saw the milk button pop up and hit it repeatedly with no result. I will try this though and see if I have any success.
---
I don't know very well myself, but I have heard from other players that 10 mm was distributed as standard issue weapons in all Vaults, which is why we as Vault Dwellers always see that a lot. I have not read any written evidence of this but the clues are clear: the Vault Dweller in Fallout 1 starts with one, in Vault 101 all the guards have 10 mm weapons; same in Fallout 4. In Vault 11 the four survivors commit suicide with 10 mm pistols. In Fallout 4, we find only 10 mm lying around in Vault 111 and also, Vault 81 residents carry 10 mm pistols. Interestingly, the wandering merchant from Vault 81 also only sells 10 mm ammo and pistol. It's possible that this is the reason, we, as Vault Dwellers, encounter more of these in early game, and it's easily possible that the ones we see in the game were mostly looted from the Vaults.
---
Were you in adventure or survival mode?
---
Yeah agreed. 
---
When my healing stops because I shoot first enemy from (any random) group, and they start searchin for me. I can still continue to do sneak crits on other enemies in the group, that I didn't shoot prior, but the super fast healing only works when completely "hidden".
---
Then messaged me and said "Lol just wanted your junk and all your caps"
---
Think your gears and spring are slightly overpriced, but you lead and aluminium are under prices you can sell to vendor more than 1cap each.
---
They are extra S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and not in a good way. I wish I paid attention to these challenges in the B.E.T.A. period *before* they became more thematical for DLC releases and grindy more recently.
---
Xbox player.
---
The community is still quite divided on this topic, but everyone is slowly getting back together, thanks to Bethesda working hard and trying their best to fix the game.
---
The game has DRASTICALLY improved. 
---
I was one of the unlucky ones to purchase the power armoured Edition (bag still hasn’t arrived yet but whatever) so this soured my taste a little for Bethesda.
---
I played the game a while ago, 2 months, and have recently been getting back into it.
---
The game is in a better state then it was on launch. There are actual interesting side quests, new areas and buildings to explore, new crafting (BEERS AND BOOZE!!!!!!), player vending (a lot of people have started to role-play/act like shop keepers which I personally love), survival is more new player friendly then before.
---
While Survival/PVP is for those that want a more hardcore/intense experience.
---
Honestly I would suggest giving it a try, and I was one of the few that hated it at launch.
---
Never wanted to get killed so many times I go from 1000 caps to 650 and I clearly didn't want to fight I stood still and he still kills me over and over again. He's toxic no doubt about it.
---
It is not a wall of hate young sir. I am just trying to prove a point to you by being the most respectful I can
---
I think so, game feels more “alive” now with the amount if quests and events going on at any one time and player vending has made the “rebuild Appalachia” sentiment more meaningful. Only thing I would suggest to them is perhaps increase the players per server limit a little
---
It is more in line with the game. But I would highly prefer decimals, at least for the below 5 prices, because to sell a ton of ammo, you'd need a ton of plastic. Ain't going to happen.
---
I want that lead.
---
Just would like someone who's ever been bullied by a high level when all your trying to do is level up and enjoy the game it's annoying
---
And that's not true after he killed me I ignored him and spawned far away and he tp'd and hit me 4 times and the 5th did 95% of my health
---
Heroetologist and Medic are not completable as well
---
Every one of you people yell and scream like children about big gov ruining your lifes. Every time i say hey been playing much much longer then 4 cause i hated 4 i get told im wrong. You child should stop listening to youtube and give it a try. You will hate it then you can move on. I fucking love this game and keeps my fallout itch scrached.
---
Ignore it, it’s false. You can re-craft all the unique rewards up to 45.
---
Its not exactly PvP though if only one P wants to V... it’s more like Player vs Unwilling Participant. Although, gonna take a workshop you better be ready to defend it, so OP had it coming I guess
---
If Armour Plated is +60 Damage -30 carry weight
---
I would extrapolate:
---
Insulated is +60 Energy Resist -30 carry weight
---
Lead Lined is +60 Rad Resist -30 carry weight.
---
I don't know for sure .... earning the badges is a beast and the Campfire Tales is hit and miss ... finished it twice today successfully with absolutely NO reward. .....
---
The fusion didn’t work for me so I just built one of those small generators in my camp and took a pic of that
---
Yes, after 50 you have the choice to either take a perk card or move a special point. Every 5 levels after 50 you'll get a card pack, too.
---
give it to friends, sell it to other users...
---
You're right but I only stick around because I'm hoping they release content that makes the current meta less relevant.
---
Look for Brahmin pen plans. Smelting spoiled fruit/meat/vegetables works for the possum challenge as well.
---
Anglers near Grafton. Beavers can spawn near the Toxic Dried Lakebed in a clearing. Glowing creatures can spawn on radstags to radroaches. Grafton Monster from Grafton Day event or can spawn south of Hemlock Holes. Mirelurk queen can spawn at the Toxic Dried Lakebed. To the northeast where the Alien Blaster is found. Radroaches south of Hemlock Holes. Radscorpions can attack Grafton Steel workshop. Super mutants can attack Grafton Steel workshop commonly and are located in the city of Grafton itself. There's some tips for ya for at least ten from my experience.
---
TSE shotguns recently got nerfed, I've heard.
---
It's most rewarding to get it on your own however.
---
That’s your opinion and that’s great that you can find constant enjoyment over the game. I seriously wish I was in your shoes.
---
I like the gameplay, building, meeting new people. But at the same time it seems like a multiplayer mod slapped onto fallout 4 with little effort (at least at first). 
---
I will admit it has DRASTICALLY IMPROVED since launch, and I’m actually getting back into it. Thus I joined this community and have been stalking around looking at what people are occasionally doing or what builds they are making.
---
But again, some people hate this game and people should be open to criticism about something they love.
---
Ex:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8
---
I've already done it, but if you still need help you can add me. Bgriff91
---
Technically you can but the chances those 40 items are worth more than my 4k items is pretty close to 0%. I'm not sure how else to help you understand this... Maybe you're just a visual learner or something.
---
for example?
---
This is getting looked at. Check the official known bugs list
---
:0
---
Re craft?
---
So the sunset pistol (or something like that) can be remade at 25? Or is that different because it’s a legendary?
---
It's not witch hunting. Hes just looking to hire some mercs. Don't see anything wrong with that
---
Well then you have sold your self haven't you? Its a multiplayer game with fallout slaped on. Thats what they are hammering out. You have got it backwards. The world is amazing and i forget other people are even there most of the time. I wish we had decitated servers so i could always roam with the same people... Someday. Just play the game ffs. You already own it. If you hate it then... Go on playing fo4 or something idk or care.
---
Did...did you just quote RLM?
---
Congrats! I have too as of yesterday.
---
Mirelurk Queens can also spawn often near Sunrise Farm.
---
Congrats to you too
---
Confused about “sold yourself haven’t you?”.
---
Because I can accept something I like, isn’t for everyone?
---
The original post literally says “it’s been months, have they fixed anything and should I give it a try?”.
---
I was answering his question and arguing against the “Yes it was always great and your not a diehard fan because you hate/disliked it”.
---
I'm typically taking 2-3 pylons whenever I join the event and going through stimpacks because of it. Tha and the darned boss disappearing is why I've stopped doing it.
---
Yeah I'll pay 25 screws and 300 caps to kill him
---
Well thats true. Die hard kinda means one thing. Not "i waffle cause its popular"
---
sheepsquatch is the same
---
Look in your event logs and see which program actually caused this error so you can fix the correct issue.  Also might try using the in-game repair functionality before anything else
---
+1 for "Breaky McGee"
---
The hardest part for me will be reviving another player. I normally go solo.
---
TSE was nerfed a lot a long time ago. they also recently "fixed" shotguns doing too much damage per shot
---
The workshop had nothing to do with it! He just took it to engage in PvP to kill me miles away from my workshop
---
no one would waste time duping aluminum.
---
I just need the head piece to complete mine.
---
I believe some of the last patch notes mentioned a steady increase. They want to test server stability with each increase.
---
I'm guessing the one you found was the drifter outfit? I forgot about that one. It's not the one I was on about but it's cool you got something you like.
---
No, it's just for weapons and armor.
---
Plastic feels pretty easy to come by to me.
---
That's a brilliant solution, love it.
---
Keep leveling and you can get every perk card you could want! Gives you the chance for multiple builds, solo/group and crafting options.
---
Someone who demonstrably conflates their opinions as fact and logic is a poor source for either.
---
[](/ce10)Really late to this post, but I don't see cultist blade. I see the cultist dagger tho. That sucks if it's not on the list, one of my dream weapons is a junkies swing speed cultist blade. Guess I'll have to keep hitting up the player vendors, farming, and hoping.
---
I just got jumped by a ton of mole rats and got xp for cooking them up. Server could be giving you the curse
---
I can't understand my mother in law I've told her many times not to go out without a scarf.😀.
---
Did you ask what gender the Brahmin identify as first? Lol
---
Yes. This would be much better than the way we have to build interior walls now, with double walls.
---
Yes but someone can be a die-hard fan of a series but hate 1 game, book or movie can’t they?
---
Also I didn’t want to cause a whole fight over this. My post above your OG one is praise for the game and how far it’s come. I do enjoy it, but I think people can be die-hard fans and still hate 1 game.
---
People hate Star Wars The Last Jedi, or the Prequels but does that not make them a die-hard fan?
---
What are you talking about? I said I thought your videos were still cool, but now you're attacking me because your ego was hurt?
---
You can't do your wall tricks without first building a foundation. I want to be able to build in areas where it's not possible to place even 1 foundation. I had hoped you found something new. Not finding anything new isn't bad. Just not what I was hoping for.
---
And what role-play are you talking about? A person that likes building bases? My very few videos aren't educational, they're just base tours. They're not fancy videos, because I'm not trying to be a "YouTube personality", they're for my amusement. Other people ask to see my bases, so I post them. Dogging on them makes you look petty.
---
Better not give wooden armor as well or I'll burn her down.
---
i sell bulk of gears and springs for 16 caps each (8%\~ more than i would get by selling to vendor)
---
they got buffed a little while ago, the Mini-gun and LMG got the best buffs of the batch. but across the board the automatic big guns got buffs to damage and durability. but i have noticed a small boost in per shot damage to some of my heavy guns when they "fixed" shotgun damage.
---
Technically, they just did with vending machines.
---
Ill agree on the prequels... You have me there. In the future it would help if you asked a more complete question. You are 1 of 15ish today and they all have the same flat wording. "Is this better?" Well what did you not like? Your a fan so what exactly is your question?
---
Xbox? I can build it for you tomorrow
---
I literally just wrapped up this merit badge. Good write-up!
---
Super Mutants are also a good source of bones. Their lairs usually have bone charms strewn about, meat bags have a chance at spawning bones, and the Mutants themselves frequently have a bone in their inventory. I made a jaunt between Huntersville and the exterior of West-Tek and got all the bones I needed there.
---
If your on PS4 I’ll come to your store and maybe buy the bear?

"Find a 3\* enemy that actually gives a 3\* item"
---
&gt; Time for some Children of Atom roleplay! 
---
In all seriousness, it's not that hard with a little preparedness. If both players have the level 3 "Rad Sponge" perk, or one of them does and shares it with a team-mate so that they're both negating each other's radiation, it should be a breeze. And that's one of those "must-have" perks that everyone should get sooner or later anyway.
---
It is a suggestion, not a question :)
---
This is a stupid response. An idioltic response. Taking a workshop isn't a license for an imbecile player to bully somone.
---
The bully full deserves to incessantly by high level players to get a taste of his own medicine.
---
Well this fucking sucks to hear.  
---
Just sold my quad auto Tesla rifle, (absolute monster for room clearance) because I got an AA Tesla drop, thought I was upgrading my damage ability.
---
It might have been easy for you but that doesnt mean its the case for everyone else. I server hopped at the water park about 20 times - nothing. Then I started doing a tour from waterpark - colonel memorial - civil war graveyard and hopped about another 20 times checking those 3 spots and got nothing.
---
Scrapper is very useful, but intelligence does help a lot. However, most weapons or armor you scrap don’t actually give very good returns... usually just steel and wood. Plastic from laser rifles/pistols is the biggest thing, at least for me. I use a shotgun, so I burn through a lot of plastic just making ammo. 
---
It’s pretty easy to temporarily raise any SPECIAL stat, one way or another. Whiskey with rank 3 party boy/girl gives you 6 strength, for example. However, you’ll make use of some stats more than others. Strength affects carry weight, which you always use. Perception affects VATS accuracy, which you’ll use constantly if you use guns. Intelligence increases gains from scrapping gear, increases durability of stuff you craft, and helps you learn mods faster. Even if you craft a lot of gear, you’ll still only make use of high intelligence every once in awhile. 
---
Of course, this depends on your build and playstyle, but my point is that you shouldn’t raise intelligence just for the passive effect. You can just eat some berry mentats and brain fungus soup before you scrap or craft. High intelligence will help early on when you don’t have easy access to consumables, but late game it will likely be wasted points. 
---
What you really want to do is set your SPECIAL stats up so you can equip one or two sets of weapon damage perks (for example I went shotguns+explosives) and max them out. No matter what build you go for, you’ll probably want to be able to kill stuff. Then you want to spend the rest of your points shaping your playstyle with utility/survivability perks, always keeping in mind that you can swap perks on the fly. For example, you can equip any relevant crafting perk combo with just 5 Intelligence. So for most builds, there’s not much reason to go higher than that.
---
Are they static spawns or more random event spawns?
---
Huh.... good point.
---
You know what I’m sorry for causing this argument that didn’t have to happen. It’s totally on me for starting it. Sorry
---
My problem with the game currently is some bugs with the enemies, you hit them and they take 0 damage (at least on Xbox),
---
Scorched Queen is almost too hard (I’m fine with this but have only been able to defeat her once, maybe make her health and everything based on the amount of people at the event),
---
Some small bugs with the camp’s building,
---
Certain weapons that need to be nerfed (this was just recently patched from what I saw),
---
The advertisement/hype for the game made me believe I was receiving something completely different (which is on me and only me). 
---
Currently I’m enjoying and loving the game. 
---
But i did really hate it when it launched and can see why people did.
---
Your also right about asking complete questions, I’ll keep that in mind for next time I post something.
---
How so? I thought your inventory and camp budget were separate?
---
How are you hitting at 1300 without legendary effects? Mine hits at around 400 with the rifle perks
---
Oh wow, 3 coin slots
---
How can you be excited for what is on its way very quickly to being abandonware?
---
Report him
---
lol hope Bethesda gives me one of their legendary “fixes”
---
Are you sure is asking you to make it?
---
Because my challenge - now complete - asked me to 'consume' it, not to 'cook' it.
---
yeah everybody else sucks! We're gonna lead appafellatio to some thing great cause narcotics keeps our men angry and our females fertile! 
---
Just you wait nothing can go wrong!
---
tse shotgun were nerfed on the last patch.
---
I'd like to see it something like that but keep crafting corner.
---
Also have it so we can have the vending machines in our base but the inventory is mirrored there. Let us keep out 120 slots across 4 machines. But also have a vendor representation at whitesprins at the same time.
---
Don't know if its possible from a technical standpoint but I hope so.
---
&gt;I'd also like to be able to create DU ammo (anti armour) but I can't.
---
You want anti armor ammo for game that has AA legendary effect, armor piercing magazines, even perks giving weapons anti-armor effect.
---
Why don''t you want a death ray gun that one shots anything? Enough is enough.
---
Its damn creepy when they are laying on the ground but float towards you
---
Replace insanely broken with wonky 😂
---
Thanks for the write up though, I picked up either the battered or crumpled fedora assuming it would work so il double check next time I'm on and use your guide.
---
Ever upwards!
---
Funny thing, the power armor editions are still for sale, out of stock, as new at a number of retail stores.  
---
And they wont take in new replacement tickets. They just refuse to. So anyone buying the edition after may 3rd is just fucked, how about that.  
---
I didnt even know about the replacement bag since a couple of days ago, I got my edition about 3 weeks back, hadnt opened it yet for I was too busy, found out about the crappy bag 3 days ago, was disappointed, googled, found that they were replaced, send in ticket, got refused as their "deadline" is over.
---
And while at it, explosive lasers with splitter as so OP now. Weapons are so flat out bad or OP.
---
They aren't even moderately tried to have some decent scaling like that.
---
It is typically the people lvl 50-100 that behave like dicks. they have there first good weapon and want to show off.... I will put in the instigating DCG and steal all legendaries from them. Normally a low damage rifle for tagging is fine.
---
I have two Xboxes and unlimited mule accounts. But I can't imagine what it would be like without that
---
30 years from now the items wouldnt be sold new out of stock in retail stores. They are however still being sold new, out of stock, right now. They should replace all of the bags, in all of the editions. They know how many went out, so they know how many they should make to be able to satify all buyers.
---
Some of them I ignore because they are ridiculously specific and it's not worth the little bit of atoms. What would be really nice is if they could fix the challenges that won't complete. Oh? I got credit for taking a picture of the light at Valley Galleria, but it still isn't credited as discovered in my other challenged, so it won't finish. Same with some other locations. They've credited on new challenges, but not old.
---
I think maybe a better idea than a timer would be coloured markers for how much time is left or maybe just yellow for un-started quests and turning green when activated by someone
---
Be like Bill &amp; Melinda, help others by sharing and giving away....
---
Stop duping then.

The 10mm is a relatively new ammo type. Invented just a decade prior to the first Fallout release and was put into service by the FBI in 1989. It was taken out of service shortly after, for what many perceived as title ix concerns, as the kick on a 10mm is unnecessarily harsh and it is more difficult to load 10mm rounds with smaller hands.
---
Maybe I’m wrong, but I always saw the popularity of the 10mm in FO as a significant point of divergence from the RL timeline. Either as a point of culture just stopping (essentially in the early 90’s - just prior to the release of FO 1) or a signal of a future not influenced by gender equality and / or assault weapon bans.
---
lvl 1 and lvl 3 terminals in atlas observatory, lvl 2 clarksburg ammo station.

 look at the challenge of archeology, prepared pemmican 0/15
---
Toxic valley gets plenty of visitors from all levels. It's fairly close to Vault 76 and there's few important places even high levels like to go, like the acid workshop.
---
Bog and eastern side of it in particular, that's a lot less populated.
---
Better them than the Liberators I keep running into
---
purchased with $$$? Or just with caps?
---
Y'know, I tried that, you figure you put a bunch of legendary items up for free, and people would take all they could carry right? Strangly even right next to the legendary grinder, people were very courteous just taking one, as tho it was a Halloween candy bowl left out on the honor system.
---
Dual input for item selection in the menu is really annoying. I hope they fix that or limit the mouse cursor function to only switch between player inventory and container/vendor/another player.
---
I have been dumping leather and asbestos to vendor as no-one seems to be buying it, what do you use it for?
---
That there are over a billion people in China? That's census information. To be completely honest, I got it from Google.  I don't think anyone records the number of video game exploiters and cheaters across-the-board per a single country. Most of what I was arguing was based off hearsay, so if you want to invalidate my argument based on that, go ahead. I can't say I've done extensive research on the subject, but a little bit of googling brought me these:

---
Good night, internet stranger who said I was racist.
---
I get your frustration, but people some slack.. A lot of people are still doing the event for the first time. It took me a while to get what we have to do too.
---
Yeah what were u on about?
---
Scorched can be gotten but you need to really follow the nerfs/buffs to min max. Id say if your just roaming its best to take on a boss when your 10 lvls higher. Or with friends or randoms much sooner. If your a grind out all the best things type its not hard to find ppl. Me i just wander and slow roll games like this. Who knows when we get the next one.
---
Sometimes i get server lags. Happens in every game ever thats online. This is still my biggest grip with the game. You dont brag about not seeing a server screen... Thats the best part! I can choose full servers or low ping or anything in between. But im guessing thats a console compromise. So ya somedays it can be unlucky (more so for console players lately)
---
Iv been ok with my camp so far. If it puts me in a world tge space is occupied i have a copy to put down somewhere else. The outside things like manual water pump i put down myself and i only have a few things out there so its not the ned of the world for me.
---
Ya i waited for a while before i jumped in too. But not out of hate for changing the formula up. I wait cause i like mp games as well as single player. With sp ill get more bang for my buck if i wait and with mp.. Well its patch city most of the time.
---
On the whole many things i could see happening but they have a good last update and 2 more to come this year.
---
Survival is in beta( im a dayz kinda player so lvl people makes me angry in pvp) hope they can knock out some harder/fairer rules for that soon. I just spen my time in adventure mode roaming the wastes looking for Duct tape and aluminium to make repairs and the next upgrade.
---
Quests you stumble on are ok... Some are fun some are tedious but its all much better with randoms to give gifts to when its over.
---
Personnally I never understand people who ask this type of question.
---
It's all a matter of subjectivity. How can we know what other people like.
---
I think it's just people who want to troll, because this make no sense at all: Just take a look at a current stream and make your own idea.
---
If it hasn’t been said already, does literally anyone in any situation actually care at all that someone is opening locks without rick of snapping a lock pick? IMHO, after level 10, LO’s exist singularly as a low weight caps currency alternative.
---
I assure you friend, my only crime is near limitless free time at a golf course... Also might be why I had such a hard time giving the stuff away. Not many people really want an assassins pitchfork, or stalkers shotguns.
---
trade in weapons and special cards for scrip, use scrip to buy weapons or perk cards.
---
This would be a good way to reduce the special cost for some of the annoying cards that take multiple special points
---
* Lockpick 3
---
* Hacker 3
---
* Hard bargain 3
---
* Gunsmith 5
---
I am sure there are a few more cards that could be combined or created as legendary special perks
---
Imposter sheepsquatch came out 35 days ago.

&gt;I mean they are supposed to be CHALLENGES NOT CHORES... and yes I am going to put a post up every single day till it changes.. thank you

Don't look them. Find something else to do. Those silly little atoms you are trying to "grind" are never going to make you really happy.
---
I got to agree with you there
---
hahahaha, the ignorant rule...
---
Whitespring sentrybots. I can get like 5 per server. Only takes 10 minutes tops to collect em all too
---
You clearly have a hoarding problem
---
I was thinking the same, a list of responses would be best to stop the greifers as I'm sure it would get out of hand otherwise.
---
So many possibilities with the personal terminals I hope they expand on them
---
Alaska was in Fallout 3. but not fleshed out enough.
---
lvl 30 3\* drill

Vanilla Fo3, nv and skyrim were really bad for that tbh
---
Captainnoob proved the drill is actually a viable weapon though.

Leather coat or travelling leather coat. They're the ones raiders wear.

T-51b has higher ballistic and energy defense values, but lower radiation protection than X-01.

Modding T-51b is easy now that the vendor is selling plans for every mod.

I don't know, I forgot about this, since someone datamined this and haven't found anything interesting, just generic rng loot, if I remember correctly.

Said that the 'local' copy of the esm does not have any provision whatsoever to obtain that recipe, is not in any levelled list so unless this is something they 'activate' server side you are SoL.

junk walls, a valid desire. i want that too. however wanting walls you can place without foundation, i show in my video. if its something people knew since beta, why didnt you just build a self standing wall between some rocks, or the junkie looking guard wall made of wall? Instead you build a full metal camp on the side of a cliff. nice roleplay.
---
i didnt attack your camp and say it looks ugly or anything. all i said is that any of the techniques werent being used.
---
your logic is stupid. thats why i called you stupid.
---
Makes sense. 
---
But I totally agree with you. 
---
It’s kinda breaking the immersion
---
I think you’re taking the piss, but honestly, can’t fault a thing you said. 👍🏻

Chaage Caad.
---
While were at it my camp could use a clean toilet aswell, so my cleanliness is godliness poster doesn't look ironic lol
---
also if you cant get your camp down on the login and stay in that world next time you are able to put you camp down your vending machines will a  be empty aswell
---
If you're on Xbox and have a Mr Fuzzy head you desperately need to get rid of I wouldn't say no... Lol

Ah, cheers dude!

Me too lol. Ive placed camp near the water tester thing outside Sunshine Industrial over the bridge, turrets are set up on the edge of camp and my beast will prowl near the front porch lol

They actually respawn daily, I go and get 8 everyday. I go through stimpak like crazy, it's a good source to keep me going.

I assume you meant Change Card.....and it just takes too much effort to load into the screen, select that i dont want to open a new perk card pack, select that i dont want to get a new perk card or move a perk point, then scroll to the card I want to swap to etc.
---
Only to repeat the process to select my 'main loadout' again.
---
take last night for example - im level 287, there was a level 127 and a level 36.  I shot the first legendary once, gave a thumbs up for the other two and the mid level guy just melee kills the supervisor in like two/three hits.  not waiting, no courtesy, no respect.  He then killed the second supervisor without the rest of us getting a shot.  Nearly did the same for the third.
---
What pisses me off is, what do they have to gain by killing it quickly?  selfish barstewards
---
i think they drop from the new event, at camp adams
---
Yea ive had trouble. Wandererd and few about lvl 60 Deathclaws I cant tame. Don't know if this is a charisma thing or not since im at least double their level as needed and it still wouldn't tame :/
---
Ive seen refined, standard and one more, but no hardened. Still well worth to use one.
---
Their specific way of an open world game. It feels like a unique mentality was held when coding. I'm thinking Fallout 3, where the theme seems to be every object in the game is coded to have an impact in the surrounding world. Not in a complex way. More like, this cup is coded to physically behave the same way in the world as that enemy I just shot down. They made an environment, and designed the combat coding on that environment. It doesn't feel like somebody fine tuned a shooter module and slammed it into ten thousand other modules. Just, okay, this gun will fire a bullet that coding wise exists in the environment the second you shoot it.
---
I'm sure I'm completely failing to describe my point. They weren't scared to let their way of coding the physics of the world take precedence over any other priority in coding. They forced dialog, combat and all else under physics as secondary but part of the environment all the same.

---
I think that all players receiving XP should be actively doing something to earn it.
---
If you can just log in, join a team and let someone else get xp for you, I think it opens a lot of potential for abuse.
---
All of the encryptids are realnlife local folklore, including the grafton monster.
---
Easy but not cheap, just grabbing plans for emergency protocols and shocks is well over 10k caps and then there's all the Flux to craft. If you're avoiding plans the pre-made 51 mods seem to be the rarest ones to pop, meanwhile the enclave is always selling X-01 mods so it's just a matter of server hopping enough.
---
Yup I usually pay them a visit when I log off or server hop anyway.
---
If I'm in for a longer session I'll grab all of the power stations, they spit out a core every 10min or so, and they're 100/100 compared to some random charge on the bots.
---
Also get the power user and energy ammo perks, gives you 1000 shots on a core.
---
That weapon has two primary prefixes, it cannot exist
---
If you’re not melee. Nope. If you are. It’s a decent weapon.
---
i’m PS4 &amp; usually have a butt ton of supplies &amp; may have some marine armor laying around. down side tho i just got to work. drop me a FR. moonadamt. i’ll help you out.
---
Nice buy if caps to spare
---
Well one problem with the Horde Events, which may of contributed to that, is the game FOR SOME REASON always spawns horde bosses horribly underleveled even in the Mire surrounded by 68+ enemies with 0 low level players anywhere nearby. Because of this the boss will spawn in and get killed by a random enemy. Earlier today I fast traveled to horde spot and the boss popped up as a Lv.22 and was surrounded by Lv.78 Super Mutants and died instantly before I could reach it.
---
max lvl? only if you have melee build for unarmed..
---
Really not the best, but yeah, you meet a Legendary sometimes. AWOL Armament is a 3* Legendary (almost) guaranteed, the Bots on Parade events have a Legendary like 3/10 times, same as the Meditation event in the Wind Palace.  
---
More [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5yzrl/lvl_40_legendary_farming_locations_and_events/).
---
Bloatflies can spawn at the Bootlegger's Shack, as well.
---
...and NO PEWPEWPEW SOUND WHEN TRIGGER!1!!
---
No but serious - you're right. The durability balance is off the pace somewhat but also the overall balance.
---
I would like to see for ALL weapon types up and downs balances - including everything from crafting, repair, ammo (craft/cost), durability, weight, damage, perks etc.
---
(got another example - rifle/heavy weapon in case of the weight. To me it makes no sense that with the right perks 1-2 heavies can be easily carried while weight the same/less than a rifle.)
---
Have my up!
---
I disagree.  Sure, these particular challenges suck, but lately they've been really easy to do.  Scrap skulls, craft/drink alcohol, take pictures of a deathclaw, go to scenic view... These ones suck, but overall I disgaree that they've been getting more and more grindy.  I actually thought to myself last week how simple they've become.  Swings and roundabouts!
---
So why doesn’t my take pics of fossils check off?
---
Sure—it’s what happened to the mole miners.
---
Because pistol builds aren't great compared to other ones i think it should only apply to pistols.
---
They may increase scrip limit once they are confident the duped items are gone. Otherwise the market could get flooded with the newly-rolled items bought with scrip generated from the duped items.
---
Wait. People dupe on console too? I had thought that was a PC issue exclusively. Fucking dupers man.
---
Itd have been good for my build but thats just me lol If you think you missed out i wouldnt worry, theres rediculous deals all over. Ive bought weapons and armor that ive seen go for thousands on reddit, for less that 1500 in game
---
Server hoping? You may have to do it 1000 times to get both calibrated shocks + jetpack. I'd much rather farm the nuked zone for the flux needed and craft those myself.
---
Do you have Thru-Hiker perk card on? It's in Agility tree
---
The when to far with the last patch as it's not right as the op says they do little or no damage at times its like shooting blanks.
---
Than happened to me before too. I was so confused and thought game bugged and put me in noclip mode with glitched graphics till I realized I was underwater. I posted the [clip](https://streamable.com/wpbhk) a while back.
---
The absence of a medal says it all.
---
If someone doesn't, I will be surprised.
---
Then again, the game seems to have different code for the exactly same thing in, when it's used in another place. So there is a decent chance drills will continue to pester us with looting, while with purveyor it can work fine.
---
Inventory sorting seems a prime example. I was trying to get all my good armor in inventory and stash to fit into one screenshot, using different sorting for each and picking up/stashing all the rest in the armor tab.
---
When sorted by damage, the armor I was wearing, was in bottom, below all glasses and other cosmetics, when I had the stash box view open. The non-weared armor in inventory was high, above all non-armor, as supposed. While looking at the inventory from pipboy, it was all sorted correctly. It makes no sense why different views have different order for the same nominal sort. I didn't bother to check but I would be expecting it that on the vendor bot the sort by damage might not be 100% same as either of the two other.
---
Would've been great if it were either AA or Instigator
---
I'm butt hurt about shotguns... I'm fully pve and it was nice being able to quickly run through my usual grinding places using minimum shells. I've gone through nearly 2k shells in a few days since nerf. Why not nerf the effects when you're on survival and leave it as it is on adventure?
---
first time is free after that is 2k to get the recall key card and it has a 3 hour cooldown period.
---
Thanks
---
What do you mean wood armor? It should be 1 star and it should not show up with the 3 star option which is what everyone will use?
---
By walking to his vending?
---
May as well since blocking doesn’t work half the time.
---
Some say he is a curse, a native spirit summoned from chief cornstalks murder.
---
You don't need to craft it just consume 3 of them by doing the daily quest where you have to collect the bug parts
---
True.
---
But wouldn't it be a slightly better way, instead of raising challenges to a level which can't be done without server hopping, hope for luck and force the exact encounter etc., to balance Atom Shop prices and items?
---
I mean - i bet there are overall two main groups:
---
PA styler - which hunger for everything that looks badass, shiny and what not.
---
The Campsters - which love do build, decorate, theme their camp from a big Mansion to a tiny clean shack.
---
Offer them what they want, for reasonable prices and they going to pay in the long run.
---
I usually sell one piece of ammo for the total (ammo*1/2 cap) price and then give away the rest of that makes sense.
---
Thanks, I'll have to keep looking...
---
Yeah nobody revives, the first time i played people just cannibalized me while i was taking a knee, and ever event since. I’m low endurance(1) in my main though, so i just gotta up the E on another character to fare semibetter lolol
---
Just a heads up. The production enclave vendor has the PLANS for the x01 mods. ALL PA has mod plans for sale at a vendor.
---
No you didn't now eat my asshole, lol best poster ever
---
Obviously player level. It's silly to think it would be something else.
---
As no one really answered your question, here's my builds:  
---
[Before](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4547d8&amp;d=pc2c72ic1ib4a72a40as2l71lu2sb2sd0su0s01so0sp0sw2sg2s71a12pq0eh1eo2a00lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=Combat&amp;m=)

---
Not saying it's the best build or anything, just my way to boost damage. My shotguns have now 300 base damage, and up to 466 with Psychobuff and 2 points in Adrenaline. Bloodied people will laugh, but that's enough to 2-4 shots almost everything.  
---
Also, with a dense Chest mod, 2 points in Fireproof and 3 in Adamantium Skeleton, you will never die from your own shots.
---
Awesome bro, I’ll drop you an FR as soon as I jump on next! 
---
Trust me I’m on that full time work like yourself man, fit in as much time for my PS4 as I can
---
Indeed they do
---
I knew my ex-wife was up to something. Oh wait...
---
Not sure who downvoted you. But you're correct that the badge only requires for you to eat pemmican to give credit. Events at Camp Adams and daily quest at Dolly Sods can reward you with those.
---
This thread tho.......
---
And a free state protectron.
---
Wait until Thursday and get rid of your legendaries. Drop the rest of your junk on the floor, you don't need that. I reapeat YOU DONT NEED THAT YOU MESSY
---
Food build or you’re doing it wrong.
---
im not sure but I have seen some post that only the first bullet does full damage and the other ones only do a % off the damage. not sure what the % are or if really works like that. im sure someone will know how it really works.
---
It's the same if you go to a restaurant and ask the owner and guests if it taste good/better now.
---
By the love of Atom - sit down, order the food and try it, if you like it come back and if still not, that there are other restaurants which suit you better. Plain and simple.
---
Could it be a mod or cache issue?
---
Pretty much every other post is a repost. I just saw some big ones about making region world bosses that got tons of votes a couple months ago. 
---
The sub goes through a weird cycle where there are good new ideas, then something controversial happens and there are tons of posts about it and mods start curating, then there’s a lull where everything is a repost until new content comes out and there are new unique ideas again. 
---
I wish people would take like 30 seconds to just search the sub before posting.
---
Fridge doesn't work. I tested it. Armor also doesn't,but it's a 5 reward.
---
I think Deathclaws may not be tameable anymore. Mirelurks should be though.
---
You only ever need 3 charisma to tame. Just enough to equip one fully maxed card.
---
So far only the carry weight one.
---
If you're on PC I can craft you X-01 jetpack, shocks and Targeting hud, but you need fluxes and mats - if you'll have I'll charge only 500 caps per piece.
---
Thru-Hiker only affects your inventory, not your stash. The number will always show the Thru-Hiker value in the description however
---
What would human NPCs really bring to the game? This is something I can't quite get my head around.
---
Literally all NPCs do in any game is stand around the same places saying the same five or six lines of dialogue over and over again or interacting with the same objects over and over again. You know what makes more sense? **Robots** doing that; which is what we have now.
---
Why is having a human NPC any different to having a robotic NPC?
---
As much as it might bring a little life to a camp or workshop, I don't even want Settlers or Companions because they are *dumb as fecking rocks* in Fallout 4. They too spout the same four or five lines of horseshit repeatedly but they follow you around while doing it!!
---
Personally I'd like the Robotics Workbench added so we could build robot sentries, Sales-bots and Mule-bots to tag along with us on resource gathering runs :)
---
As an archaeologist I love seeing archaeology in game. Can’t wait to try this challenge!
---
Nah man that's just the game. If I log off in whitespring, when I get back on the ghouls are invisible and the lag is serious. I'll be running around looking for stuff to kill and all of a sudden I'm dead and surrounded by ten ghouls that took lessons from weeping angels.
---
&gt;and the radium rifle lacks mods to make them really viable weapons.
---
What mods? It has pretty much all mods that other rifles have.
---
Perk cards don't affect your stash. Anything you place into stash will revert back to its base weight. It can be confusing since weight on item isn't automatically updated when switching between stash and your character.
---
its a hit off luck, i have done it solo where only the sheepsquatch spwans and i have also gotten recked with a mob off bugs and 2 sheepsqautches spawn. I dont do them alone anymore, I just send text to ppl in my server and wait for few to show up.
---
I just bought a trash one with 90% reduced weight and just use it to cripple big enemies.
---
Nah man, [I'm giving it all away](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/577788349608230933/Photo_2019-05-14-042247.png)! Gotta find good homes for all this crap.
---
One that we actually used.
---
And I'm just waiting for more serious outfits. What's up with all this Fortnite stuff?
---
Anyone sharing the high capacity mod right now please
---
Thanks everyone. My buddy agreed to help me with it tonight.
---
Cannonballs are heavy, lol no?
---
Yup.
---
Or there are people that exaggerate how bad something is to make a point. When the other people on a discussion all say x, and you swear its y. Well... you know.
---
And - if you got banned in the restaurant for take everything at the all you can loot or behave like a whatnot overall - don't stand on the porch and cry "i'm banned, others did the same but i'm unguilty..."
---
That's pathetic for you and awkward for other guests.
---
Does it come with any side effect? like reduced defence stats?
---
Just only 30 pounds carry weight instead of the standard 60
---
Awww that's a shame :(
---
it wont change a thing if ppl can keep dopping, first the dopping needs to be patched and then bring new tier weapons/gear.
---
Like nothing should be more then ten bucks unless is a bundle. I would probably buy alot more if things were cheaper. Also ever since repair kits I've kinda boycotted the shop but if something actually worth it comes out I'll grab it.
---
Hahahaha
---
See you soon when the keg arrives buddy! Looking forward to it
---
I think about something to bring with for the grand opening
---
Why is collector bugged? I did it last night easy. I've had all magazine beside the one not in the game( not needed for the challenge)
---
Silver ore can be obtained with the event breach and clear. Man i'm correcting pretty much every post. You guys need to know the game more tho, not everything is a bug.
---
"Hey buddy, make sure you tag this for the xp!!!" is something I never thought I'd hate so much. It breaks up EVERYTHING we do.
---
I got you, fam:
---
https://i.imgur.com/exgXlHi.jpg
---
It happened when I was taking a picture of a bug corpse (in a nuked zone) for one of the other challenges, and it gave it to me.  Fuck it, a win's a win! xD
---
My X-01 has served me from the day I got it and ive never looked back from it. Using the grounded mutation can make up for lower energy defence.
---
The only thing you need to worry about are the Colonel Gutsy who's bullets seem to rip through the Armor, everything else it tanks extremely well
---
When you all say container, which one do you mean? food? Ammo? Chems? Because there are specific perks that could help.
---
Nope you can get any of these
---
Im not really butthurt about it but not happy either when a BE combat shotgun hitting for 1200 can’t reliably one hit a level 62 ghoul and barely denting a supermutant warlord
---
helping low lvl player is one off my things to do ingame, i just want everyone to start on the right foot. im glad you are enjoying the game, hope to see you in the field.
---
How do i upvote twice?
---
Then i am glad, you have this problem too :D
---
This is a pretty batshit crazy couple of paragraphs
---
does that include the ultracite ?
---
I can't find by drop or for sale, ever, over 60 levels
---
bos vendor- never , all 45/50/60, but not the ultracite.
---
if yes, do you know which vendor, if its specific
---
I've seen them. I saw one on phonix. And try the bos vendor in WS. I've also seen them for sale in player vendors. I've sold a few but those were duplicate drops from bos events.
---
near Helvetia?
---
Yup, I read the post, and comments, stop whining that other people have the same weapons and armor you do and you and your team can't come up with a strategy that works.
---
Wow man, you gave me waaay to much credit with that response, lol. Thanks though. I agree this is a frustration, and a way to dispose of the unwanted cards would be good.
---
I'll give it a look!
---
Challenges should give people a reason to login and play the game, not scare them away.
---
I am very much at the point where i see the challenges as useless as I will never really get them done, so why bother loggin in?
---
You complain like A LOT about Bethesda judging from your post history.  I get what you’re trying to say but this had nothing to do with dupers and more so about the fight you got in.  And don’t worry, they do care, and they read everything despite what people think.  I’ve been calling another ban wave this past week to show up soon.  But this time inventories get wiped.
---
It’s been suggested hundreds of times, only a few hours of playing the game shows the perk card system to be poorly thought out and designed. I gave up bothering with picking locks around level 20. 
---
Just have all camp based cards active when you’re in your camp, all work bench cards when using a work bench, lock pick and hack when doing these... swapping out these situational cards just when you need them is the definition of tedious, how this system got the green light from bethesda in house testing, before the beta,  is mind boggling.
---
Yup you took plasma weapon, you shoot a guy and you looted piece of ash.
---
You are out of fusion cores.
---
Yeah...I see many complaints but no solution ideas, so thought I would put one forward that was it just the usual ‘The SPECIAL system is rubbish blablabla’
---
A mod for the deathclaw gantlet, mole glove, and knuckles where you get a left arm it takes up the mod slot but can swing faster because you use both arms (and the unarmed animation) the mod costs the same as building a new verion of the weapon
---
or if you want to be insane let us put another weapon in our offhand and let legendary effects stack 2 bloodied deathclaw gauntlets with double bonus swing speed and the martial artist cards punching people like your in JoJo.
---
Have you been getting them this week?  I'm not getting any, and the only other person that commented said you don't get them anymore.
---
putting a limit to something forces you to come back every day to grind if you want that item bad enough. just like when an new update comes out everyone comes and play and soon the get what they want to,  the amount off ppl that login comes down. its the natural circle of the game.
---
I usually fast travel there if is getting darker at my server and i can trigger the event. 
---
If i'm hopping servers and is daytime i won't botter. Other times, if it is nighttime already the even may have already started so is worth your while to fast travel there. I've done it countless times but only got 2 possum medals from it :(
---
I’ve noticed super mutants drop loose screws.
---
What you get from the machine:
---
1 star armor = 3 scrip  
---
2 star armor = 9 scrip  
---
3 star armor = 24 scrip  
---
1 star melee = 5 scrip  
---
2 star melee = 15 scrip  
---
3 star melee = *don't know*  
---
1 star ranged = 5 scrip  
---
2 star ranged = 15 scrip  
---
3 star ranged = 40 scrip  
---
Consistent with your datamining.
---
Hard bargain has no effect on the "prices".  Nobody bargains in a scrip economy, you'd get beaten up by the Pinkertons.
---
Go to the Encryptid event when you see someone pop it,or pop it yourself. People die like bloatflies there.
---
Tbh a 35dmg furious drill would be decent
---
Just use a tesla gun and have your buddies use it. Guarantee hit on every mob around
---
White springs bunker.. FT there then head toward the main entrance of the bunker over that hill.. usually 2-4 spawn there
---
Yea I hate that too. I actually died twice to a legendary super mutant because I get ‘ghost hitting’
---
Again it's more about hopping the right location. You can hop at the lighthouse significantly faster than other locations because you can literally see the tourist corpse from where you spawn in. If its not there, simply move to the next one. You still have to make lots of hops, but the time each hop takes is significantly reduced.
---
If you try the lighthouse, I recommend giving the corpse a few seconds to spawn in and make sure you get close enough for your view distance to have it load as well.
---
I was trying to do it but the page wouldn't load so I deleted the email and 30 minutes later I had cleared the backlog of emails since 2011 and forgot what I was doing
---
Good timing I was just about to look for someone, adding you now
---
Thx for sharing your opinion ! I do agree some parts of the challenges are not that hard to complete as you mentioned. However I there's a few things they've changed about the daily / weekly challenges. Here's a few things I noticed.
---
1. The level up daily challenges used to be without any additional requirements. meaning we can simply just level up a character. But now we have more restrictions on how do you level up like wearing certain outfits, at specific locations, below or beyond x level....etc.  I've missed the level up timing for multiple times 
---
2. Collect woods / scarp stuff challenges. The system used to count how many wood scraps have you collected / junk materials did you get from scrapping them . Now they're only counting how many objects did you actually interact with. ex. before you only need to collect 100 wood scraps. but now you have to collect/interact with the wood piles for 100 times.
---
3. take a few daily challenges from 2018 as an example. 
---
Level up: 10 Atoms
---
Boil 10 Water: 10 Atoms
---
Collect 100 wood: 20 Atoms
---
Kill a Scorched: 10 Atoms
---
Cook 5 soup: 10 Atoms
---
Revive an Ally: 10 Atoms
---
Harvest 5 Bloodleaf Plants: 10 Atoms
---
Kill 10 Feral Ghouls: 20 Atoms
---
In most of the cases, old challenges have no RNG things involved. And I noticed that I'm spending huge amounts of time and works to just complete 1 challenge with 10 atoms or server hopping like crazy just to find something to spawn.
---
Don't forget the stupid "hunter/hunted win while in a group" challenge that pops up every day now.
---
Oh, thanks! I'm from Russia and in our translation it says to cook it, probably mistake.
---
Thank you. :)
---
yeah shes prob in the files already her shop has been in for the game a while just boarded up
---
cheers ,I'll continue to search
---
juat as a bye the bye, wotoga vendor had t60 calibrated shocks for 250 caps...........normally 4.5k.   if I can get hardened mass,(major headache for me), then I might go back to that, but the ulrtacite is dam close to being indestructable.
---
1. Horders hord. Vendors stock. And marketing marks up. Yes it's common knowledge that you don't need a plan after it's "known" but for some of us it's an easy way to make caps.
---
2. Weight. A few patches ago plans had 0.0 weight. Yes they "fixed" this issue last patch. But with mules friends and multiple accounts it's easy to get past the 800 stash space limit. I have 2 accounts both with 4 characters. Main account 2 playable toons 2 mules. Second account 4 mules.
---
Primary
---
1. Hvy weapons/PA build (lvl 160)
---
2. Beserkers Build ( lvl 65)
---
3. Wepaons mule 768/800 only 2\* and 3\*
---
4. Armor mule 700/800 2\* and 3\*
---
Secondary
---
1. Plan/mod mule 790/800
---
2. Ammo mule 800/800
---
3. Crafting mats mule 1 800/800
---
4. Crafting mule 2 800/800
---
  
---
All my mules have at least 10k caps and 100 free weight to fast travel.
---
That's what I started with when player vendors hit.
---
I haven't don't much inventory management this week due to IRL issues. But last week made a good 15k caps selling extra plans and mats.
---
So yes some are Altoholics and some plan ahead. Other just say F@\#$ it and head into the wilds to see what's available.
---
Hope this helps
---

---
On my PA hvy/shotgun toon. I haven't repaired my t51 or my x01( rarely used). In over a month. And yes I repair to 200% with fix it good.
---
I've got yesterday a 2 shot laser rifle of level 35. Was really excited and maxed whatever I could from it. It ended having around 71 damage with the quad mean splitter thing, took it for a test run on some maxed scorched and I was utterly dissapointed. Even with all 4 beams hitting the enemis took like 8 to 9 hit to go down. 
---
Not sure what perk may benefit this gun the best, but i have all 3 non aouto rifle perks maxed, and equipped and it was just a let down to use
---
No. They fixed it. The old calculation was wrong.
---
Rabbits spawn pretty much anywhere you let them.  They breed like rabbits.
---
I spent a few hours looking for a good place to try to improvise one but had no luck.
---
I honestly thought that's how they were supposed to be... I thought the one shot power was to compensate for the poor range, fire rate and reload times. It was balanced! What's the point of an explosive shotgun if enemies are getting so close that you blow yourself up because you've had to put 3 shells into them? 
---
Good job it's easy to switch from shotgun to melee...
---
I just want a wall that's the same on both sides, like a concrete wall.
---
No more of this "one side is just supports where your decor look like crap" garbage.  And not the brick wall with one side brick and one side white.
---
Just a regular, old grey concrete wall.
---
I actually haven't been this week, when I get home tonight I'll make a run there. It is possible that maybe something was done with it in patch 9,but 2 weeks ago I made daily runs as I was diluting heavy to get my stock back up.
---
They don't exactly have a good track record
---
Да нет проблем, братуха. Удачи!
---
I'd halve everything, especially the Power Armor paints, which are completely ridiculous.
---
Depends on the primary effect. If bloodied or instigating then yes you messed up. A Bloodied swing speed max lvl powerfist is a 12-15k cap weapon. If something less useful then it was a good price but not a screaming deal.
---
Ok nice. Just need to decide which I want more. +90 dmg resist or +90 rad resist. 
---
I suspect the dmg resist is more efficient, as you cant stack enough rad resist to compare to hazmat/PA anyway. Decisions decisions.
---
I tryed, even wanted to spend real money on it... but the Shop didnt work for a solid week for me...
---
I have killed every type of creature in the game; legendary, scorched, diseased, you name it.
---
I have done this several times over.
---
I still haven't gotten  credit for all of them for the challenge for killing them.
---
I have given up on challenges completely because they never seem to track properly.
---
If I *happen* to complete one randomly, good.
---
But I won't chase them or even open the menu for them anymore.
---
Then you need another post for all the people asking “We need to be able to build X in our camp right now”
---
Things in the atomic shop used to be even more expensive (a single Christmas bundle can cost you 2000 atoms, there were 3 btw) but the atoms were way easier to earn.
---
just take a glimpse at last year's daily challenges:
---
Claim an owned Workshop: 40 Atoms
---
Consume 10 raw meat: 20 Atoms
---
Scrap a human skull: 10 Atoms
---
Take a photo while only wearing a hat: 20 Atoms
---
Level up!: 10 Atoms
---
got he ultracite at around l50. now l104.... only 4 times has a piece dropped below 100%....45,50,60 never did that
---
calibrate shock would make life just so much better,even the torso mods to increase carry weight by 10, but I can find ....nothing.
---
yeah it sucks.
---
Oh... I have a melee character that is like that. It's with a Anti-Armor, 40% swing speed combat dagger (knife). But with martial arts I do those 10 stabs in a second or two. It's great for large mobs and single big enemies. One stab and move on to tag or loads to take something down.
---
When they buffed heavy weapons they forgot about explosive heavy weapons and they still break way too fast.
---
They don't even code the physics themselves, they use the Havoc engine which was outdated already when FO3 came out. Bethesda is definitely not strong at tech.
---
i'd be also interested in just hardened mass.
---
Max caps is 25,000
---
Max scrip is 1,000
---
So I'd say 25 caps per scrip.
---
Purchase prices from Murmrgh:
---
1 * weapon = 25 scrip = 625  
---
2 * weapon = 50 scrip = 1250  
---
3 * weapon = 100 scrip = 2500  
---
1 * armor = 15 scrip = 375  
---
2 * armor = 30 scrip = 750  
---
3 * armor = 60 scrip = 1500  
---
Sale prices to the machines:
---
1 * weapon = 5 scrip = 125 caps (20%)  
---
2 * weapon = 15 scrip = 275 caps (30%)  
---
3 * weapon = 40 scrip = 1000 caps (40%)  
---
1 * armor = 3 scrip = 75 caps (20%)  
---
2 * armor = 9 scrip = 225 caps (30%)  
---
3 * armor = 24 scrip = 600 caps (40%)
---
The water park is the same though. Only have to run forward for a few seconds. And what you're saying about waiting kind of defeats your point about it being fast lol. But anyway, all of this is ignoring the fact that you shouldn't even have to play a stupid game of server hopping. It's simply bad game design and anti-fun.
---
I have a single 1 start bloodied Power fist and is still ok. I changed to a 3 star troubleshoter with 40% extra damage and some other attribute, i think is 1+perception or strength. This one is great but the bloodied one hits hard. 
---
Since i go melee a lot lately, i usually go with my bloodied mole miner, sadly 1 star. Hopefully the purveyor will give me today some better melee weapons.
---
Their record is what? Repair kits? Cosmetic items. That's a pretty good list compared to some games
---
That's awesome, In some of the suitcases outside a train station someone has filled a suitcase with all sorts of good stuff, I took about 600 5.56 incase anyone else needed
---
That is one guy who really gets it!
---
I found as mods 5 shocks and 2 jetpacks. That was before the vendor patch. Now I have the plans to make both for t45,51,60 and x01. Slowly getting all the plans for all the PA
---
Mine is just explosive, and hits 450 with all 3 rifle perks maxed at 9
---
They don't happen much but I got my revive at the fake sheepsquatch event
---
people should really stop speaking about ban when using mod...
---
I did receive the survey and also filled it in. Here's hoping Bethesda will actually consider our answers.
---
Honestly the only huge step forward for you will be a bloodied swing speed weapon. However, they are extremely popular if on a popular weapon base. Hence the very large step up in value between a 1.5k bloodied power fist and a 12k bloodied swing speed power fist. Swing speed is a straight up 40% increase in dps. Add a third star with a +Str and you have a god roll weapon that is trade only and usually worth more than 25k caps. The full combo is very very very rare and a lot of people want it.
---
I found exactly 10 in a random encounter - the Ms Nanny that wants you to tag wildlife 'for science'.
---
So, I tagged them with my Pearly Peepers then proceeded to butcher every single one of them - the 'compass pip' remained even though I swapped weapons.
---
Such a wholesome thing to do for science and badges.
---
Okay so it's not just me, got a 3 star lvl 50 gatling gun with a bunch of aiming related bonuses, 103 per 5mm bullet and then if I aim it's 10 more damage. Compare this to my lvl 50 rifle that does 112 damage per 308, it's insane
---
First time I found a sheepsquatch I had to make a squad of mutants divert it's attention while I slapped it tf up with 3 melee weapons
---
I used the silver wolf fedora from the fake sheepsquatch event and worked wonders. I haven't bottered yet with the maps things
---
Awesome costume, love the poster, yes the sheepsqauch ate my butthole aswell.
---
You have no idea how much games cost and to maintain
---
You are not wrong!  I don't agree with RNG reliant challenges (finding Grahm at a workshop or radstorm related stuff), but anything else can be done with a bit of determination.  The amount of effort required isn't all that much really, in the big picture.
---
Personally I'd prefer just having ability to save different perk loadouts. So instead of swapping 5 or 6 different perks depending on what I'm doing, i can easily swap between my "camp" or "crafting" loadout to "Power Armor" or "Non Power Armor" etc etc... PC is lucky in that sense, as mods have been created that do exactly that. It's those of us on console that are at bugthesda's mercy, since we'd require something official via patch.
---
Is this game worth getting back into? I haven't played in 13 hours.
---
/s
---
Not anymore, thanks for the heads up though.
---
Repair kits post secret nerfs...
---
A few of these are well intentioned mechanics that didn't land as intended.  Push to talk is one of them; I imagine this was intended to encourage players to talk to each other but hit issues when applied to the real world.  
---
The random tourist is an attempt to slow people down on content. Armor and damage is always an ongoing battle between keeping casuals interested and min-maxers satisfied.  And the npc issue has been done to death.
---
However, the core issue is where you think good but unfun game design is an oxymoron.  Sometimes games are designed to have unfun elements for various reasons.  Spending hours in Morrowind looking for the 2nd dead tree east of Balmora and then heading 20 paces north was not fun, until I found what I was looking for and got my payoff. Bully's detention mechanic was unpleasant from game play to sound design. (To this day that music gives me shivers.)  Grinds are often boring.  Sometimes you have to introduce unfun intentionally into a game to push towards certain behaviors, or to increase the satisfaction and payoff for completing something.
---
And yes, they are probably trying to sell more Atoms.  That's also fine. It can be multiple things.
---
I have 2 peices of legendary gear with -50% fall damage and I do this everywhere I go without your fancy power armor
---
Good place to check is the riverbed of New Gad near Lakeside Cabin and another a bit north towards the bridge.
---
Also, Twin Lakes in Savage Divide has a spawn on the northern side of one of the lakes.
---
Those places can spawn any type of critters (radstags, frogs, beavers, etc), so just keep server-hoping until you get rabbits
---
I wish all would be as nice.
---
I also realize that even though I want to save a weightless boxing glove to give to a one shotting asshole as a way to teach him the right path, he would just scrap it for the scrip.
---
They're wrong, there is one badge that requires you to eat 3 pieces and it can be completed normally.
---
The possum badge requires you to cook it. I just ate 2 pieces and it still shows 0/15 so we have to keep trying to get the recipe.
---
Take my upvote good sir!
---
Should be a challenge -- "blacklist a player: 40 caps".
---
So I'm not really gonna give any suggestions to the build because I think you're too low level. Just keep going and level up to 50, and once you get there you can start thinking about build proper. Aim to have high endurance and Strength, low perception, and perhaps high agility for AP.
---
What I will say, is make sure you are searching containers for pharma. A button will come up that just says search, I wasn't doing this until I was level 60/70, which meant that all my "Search" perks were dead weight, butcher's bounty, can do, etc.
---
OH one suggestion is no to upgrade the Gladiator card just yet. If you get expert gladiator it stacks for +20%, whereas Gladiator (2\*) is +15%, also something that was pointed out to me later on! 
---
Hope this advice helps!
---
&gt;Hopefully the purveyor will give me today some better melee weapons.
---
She's coming on the 16th you got 1 more day. I'm hoping she treats us well.
---
I've picked up so many extra ones and fixed them up to give away, but I can't give them to people! They just get destroyed when dropped...
---
I like it.. In fact id take it a step further. You only get 4 cards total for pacifist and then any leftover you get for a loss of some value. A trade in od sorts.  And add more unique cards ffs.  and negative effects to everything.
---
 There is only the choice by the latest patch. 
---
Make everything have a downside on top of not choosing something else.
---
Want to eat the dead... 75% less food from non fresh human like meat. Other negatives need to apply.
---
 Its all buffs in this game as far as character progression gos. No down side to not picking something.. And no unique bonus either.
---
Are they really selling JUNK items for real money?
---
I think static.
---
Simple thing: ps4 and xbox users can easily send instant messages to users. PC users can't, thus no arguments are valid, it's not a fair or equal scenario. give us text chat already!
---
Is this crying or rant? O.o
---
Could be a reward for a daily you did. Not sure, as I haven't seen any badges on my reward list from either dailies or Camp Adams' event
---
Last time i was counting my skins vaulue i got to 13k atoms. Just by playing. I don't want change prices, they are gooooooood. BUT STOP FUKCING CHALLENGES THAT ARE IMPOSUBRUUUU.
---
“Retahd”
---
Rant lol.  Though in survival I seem to die to people with TSE weapons pretty often.
---
How do you give them away? Every time I try to drop one, it gets destroyed, and I can't sell them to other players directly or put them in my vending machine. I've tried with just the pure broken ones and with ones I've repaired.
---
Rabbits seemed to only spawn around Helvetia when the Fasnacht event was running. I go through there sometimes and never see any now. 
---
Hill above the Whitesprings Bunker is more reliable.
---
Comeon you will die to everything on survival, damage is balance fairly, so you die in two shots from most weapons. As i sai milion times here, When i was level 200 i was killed by two shots from 8lvl guy using pump shotgun.
---
Nah, by the looks of it, it wasn't going to last much longer anyway.
---
They can
---
South of Whitesprings a bit
---
Oh, i though duping methods were gone, my bad. :D
---
AND THE BATTLE’S BEGUN
---
#THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED
---
My backyard.
---
Jerks keep eating my flowers.
---
Anyone can come with their flamer and roast those bastards.
---
And can I finally have pet snallygaster?
---
I normally target their thrusters. It seems to be their weak point and lets me drop them in 1 or 2 shots. I just think they have a lot of armor shred compared to other npcs.
---
How much are you burning it though? Have you seen any plastic sold on vending for reasonable price?

I'm on pc and don't use or even have a microphone.
---
Pick up every fan you see.
---
Well, that makes sense but also doesn’t for me atleast. I like to play a lot at a time so it gets frustrating.
---
whitespring, west tek, maybe events like one violent night that spawn a lot of ghouls and such
---
equip the f'lame proof' perk care in endurance to negate the Explosion damage
---
lol!
---
Still waiting on that proof from the other person. They went radio silence after claiming they'd take video to prove it wrong. Wonder why he was such bjg talk then went silent after saying he would prove it isn't true? Oh right, because it is true.
---
Yeah thanks. Ive waited till they respawned and now ive got 6/10 gonna try server hopping to see if theyll be there.
---
I completely agree. I thought it was all busy work. I am very happy with the backpack itself though!
---
The higher your charisma the better the chance you have of getting the rarer rewards for events.
---
Ah! Thanks for the heads up.
---
Speed V-Fast w/ constantant stagger w/ furious, bloodied, and vampire legendary effects at level 50.  Can you imagine the utter carnage?
---
20% damage buff to lazers, 15% to plasma, lessen recoil, make one shot take a tenth of what it does now
---
So fire rate is good, magazine size is good?
---
Any problems you are having with .38 pipe gun would be shared by any other fast rate of fire .38.
---
It’s a mess atm. And with no pre-sets if cards it takes forever to change cards (on console at least)
---
I could see the use of this if implemented correctly!
---
Lucky thing to happen!
---
Get disconnected from server 5 times. 10 caps
---
To get so much damage he may be using adrenal perks and other mutations/ buffs to get that damage, if it was bloodied that’d be easy

COMING DOWN THE MOUNTAINSIDE
---
🎵 **THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED**
---
You could before, you can’t now.
---
My first (and only) tse was a black powder pistol and it droped from a lvl 42 ghoul at the whitespring golf course.
---
I depends on what your idea of a *healthy economy* and *fun game* is. For some this is great. They just love getting those weapons for cheap. For others it takes all the sense of accomplishment out of the game and totally ruins the fun. We've had great dupes before and the economy did get back to something more "normal" eventually. Hard to say how long it will take this time. 
---
We will ofc never have the game the way Bethesda envisioned it. The damage is done. I just hope there's no new duping methods in the future or at least for a loooong time.
---
why are they doing this to me? :(
---
I did have one before the update but didn't like the look of him
---
This was... horrific experience. Thanks for the help, got the badge.
---
get tesla and send nuke on prime fisure site, there will be tones of mobs, tag everything and kill SBQ as bonus.
---
Big difference between consoles and pc's. Consoles come with screen capture software built in. I don't know about windows 10 but 7 and every OS before it never came with capture software.
---
They could do a “redo” of sorts, such as the idea of a Prestige System, but only if they were confident that they wouldn’t be duped, hopefully they find a way around it (fingers crossed)
---
When was this a thing? There was once a post which listed all pets yet no snallygaster. And if so why was it changed?
---
Lasers are lame until you try to PVP against the now insanely duped TSE lasers. Or watch them one shot 3* minions before anyone gets a shot in.
---
Well i do have a tesla
---
glad to help, i wasn't as lucky in getting it this time around, maybe next time
---
Yeah, I was really hoping they’d be invulnerable as well :(
---
I hate all the picture challenges. Give me something to kill dangit.
---
Not really, they're pretty balanced
---
I was not enough deep in the water? We can retry it when you want.
---
Any many cases the boss gets killed by other creatures before you arrive.
---
If you already bought it, not playing it is the best thing Bethesda could ask for. You've already given them the money, now you're now costing them the money to maintain server side. Congratz, you've played yourself
---
If legendary items were more balanced, people would be vending and trading more than pvp armor and bloodied. I think duping just pushed the flaws to the forefront. Theres not many good builds for end game players to buy, and duping sped that process up.
---
Yes. And even at level 200 they sometimes give useful cards. Getting multiple levels of perk cards takes quite a lot.
---
Yeah, I used to check in daily to complete some dailies and have a go at the weekly, but I've barely touched it after the ridiculously complex and time consuming challenges started appearing. Fuck that
---
Yes laying on the ground and moving around and can’t kill them (but they can kill you!) 
---
This morning I got a 3 star quad assaultron head and a 3 star assassins/sentinel marine leg. And a 2 star stalkers minigun. I’ve probably farmed WS hundreds of times and not gotten two 3 star drops in one sitting and two today in one trip lol.
---
TSE got nerfed hard - two shot now does something like 25% bonus on base damage, explosive now also does only 25% bonus, and I think the benefits from Demolition Expert were nerfed either across the board or just in relation to Explosive legendary effects.
---
No longer the absolute beasts they used to be, which is a shame. I get it was impossible to deal with in PvP but it made the bullet spongey PvE enemies a non-issue.
---
Where did you find it???
---
Too bad you can't get the regular backpack that way uuurgh
---
Nice. Got my TSE double barrel ages ago and since then I've got no other two shot or explosive weapons at all.
---
It's kinda like shooting a wet paper towel at the enemy now, compared to how it used to be, but it's 100% legit and for that I doubt I'll ever let it out of my hands.
---
I'll work on luring a single melee enemy to the pool and you can join me then
---
Doesn't work through walls, I tried it to get out.
---
Did it work?
---
I think the cost of atoms should be reduced, say 50%. I have so many times considered bying but then realizing how expensive those are. For example, power armor paint 18€. I paid 14€ for Fo3 GOTY and 10€ for Fallout New Vegas including all DLC. So with the price of paint I could get an entire game. Twice. But 5€ for power armor paint and I'd buy them all. So would thousands of other. Not to mention how huuuuge wasted potential atomic shop has when it comes to cosmetic (and P2W like repair kits) :(
---
Snallygasters were tameable off of Wasteland Whisperer only. I’ve tamed several myself.
---
They just changed taming with this latest patch. A bunch of creatures were removed from the tameable animals pool, and some were moved from Animal Friend to Wasteland Whisperer.
---
1 weight each is very heavy for ammo.
---
Can't do that without capture software running the entire time. He already supplied a video. The burden of proof is on you to disprove his video with your own.
---
It seems you already know exactly what to do so shouldn't take you long to disprove it, right?
---
I honestly think it's just the opposite. High prices on some of these god roll items pushes the desire to dupe. If the marketplace stopped raising the value of these weapons to insane amounts, there'd be less reason to dupe and the problem would mostly solve itself. 
---
At launch, before everyone easily had access to cap max, God rolls were closer to 2-3k. Then they were hitting 5-7. Now some people are trying to get &gt;25k which means you need a mule even to just get paid, and that's just insane for an item that the game says has a value at most of like 1500. 
---
I think the new legendary vendor is going to help with it a bit as many dupers are likely to scrap much of their excess stock trying to get the ultrarares that are only available through the vendor (non drop rolls) which will become the next target of duping. 
---
The response needed though isn't from Bethesda, the solution comes from the people unwilling to buy from someone you even suspect is a duper. If the person has dozens of similar weapons for sale, just decline to buy or say you'll only buy at bulk available prices so now that they have 30 you can offer 4-5k instead of 15-25+. 
---
There's a few legitimate vendors this will negatively affect but those that are running legitimate business can adjust their sales accordingly, dupers are generally lazy and won't accommodate marketplace rules so it's easier to identify them. 
---
But so long as people are continuing to be willing to buy from dupers they can't then turn around and complain about them as you've now become the problem yourself as mass duping wouldn't affect the game without people buying those duped goods. No one really cares as much about someone doing something like duping gold scrap to max their cap stash, it's about flooding the market with cap grabs. 
---
The only thing Bethesda can do is to keep working to patch exploits as soon as they find them and continuing to add new items that didn't exist previously that likely have not yet been affected by duping. I think adding a weapon tier for weapons lvl 100 would be an ideal option, but maybe tie it to scrip or a mission making it a time wall or less devalued currency required. (Currently Scrip can't be traded so it requires earning it character specific)
---
my camp still gets grass through it, had to move 6 times before it stopped
---
Thank you for all this helpful info! I’ll definitely keep all of that in mind. 
---
Much appreciated.
---
They are making challenges impossible so that players like you would instead of getting free 13000 atom should buy them, costing... 130€
---
What are People willing to pay for 1 star unyielding armor? I have 10 pieces in my stach of variing types of armor.
---
The no build buffer between camps is quite large, actually about the size of another whole camp. That is enough that if you just look around you don't see the other person camp but if you walk around a little then it appears. Had that problem quite often unfortunately.... Bethesda doesn't like you to have neighbours!
---
I have five end game characters so have had to do this five times now absolutely awful grindy experience cant even bring my self to look at the  possum challenges yet
---
Yup, got the UI visual bug and this bug on top of it. It is crazy how many bugs they can add to such small additions. Such as the emote teleport from the camera, how they still have impossible to complete challenges every week. The server stability is back to patch 2 levels of instability, added in dupes, still have dupes from patch 5 in the game. Etc.
---
Btw the missile launcher has a mod you can buy that will allow the missile to track the target, mod is called Targeting Computer, as mentioned earlier, there is a quest reward launcher legendary called Bunker Buster that has that installed by default.
---
Just because you suck at the game, does not mean others are cheating.
---
I don't much care for the battle royal idea, but i do think there should be another game mode along with adventure and survival.   
---
Maybe like a horde mode, you use your ingame characters but it throws you into a small server with 4 players at a random workshop which you have to defend.  
---
Would be a good way to introduce new defense plans, game modifiers etc, they could also introduce other game modes with it.
---
I did this last month and wasted 60gb of a capped connection just to realize fo76 is still shit.
---
I have found several. I'm not sure if you can trade them with other people though, I'd give you it if I can. What platform are you on?
---
Add me on Xbox @Frostyyy3 let's make it happen boys
---
Allright, I'll join you in a minute.
---
They did. This was over a single gun. It ks either bought or not. No way the visual bug could cause an issue on a single gun or armor. The UI bug only effects items in stacks.
---
Fixed aka just nerfed it. Exp shotguns are worthless now.
---
Walk the road all the way from Watoga to thunder mountain, but especially Robco/generals to the Dam. Clear each of the location spawns. Log off, reconnect, walk back. 
---
As a side benefit also some of the best legendary spawns currently in the game.
---
I was hoping to become a PA seller but that didn't happen... Don't sell much at all on my main character now.
---
i havent tried it after the hotfix, but after patch 9 you could still kill pets on camps-
---
How is it ruined? You see people complain that guns go for over the 25k cap limit then when people dupe the guns are affordable. People will never be happy
---
The technology is obviously there, they've had it for years now what with Skyrim. I think the way it worked in that was pretty alright, too - potentially double your damage output but lose the ability to block. And if it applied to pistols, you could double damage output but also double reload time and lose the ability to aim down sights. Not to mention using ammo twice as much and needing to repair two guns instead of one.
---
I think it would be pretty cool.
---
I'd settle for boxcars in general - one of my favourite items in FO4.
---
Yeah but remember it says "revive an ally" meaning you have to be in a group?
---
Fixed as in I cannot make them, but if I never moved that base, I can keep it!
---
Why would you have PA on anyway
---
If it does actually need to be crafted, my best guess would be scout-related events and quests like the Campfire Tales event at Camp Adams, or the repeatable quests in the Toxic Valley and Mire.
---
Lol has more larger updates than fo76 as does path of exile. Neither of which have had anywhere close to the number of bugs this game has had. I honestly can't remember the last time either released a patch that had major bugs in it. But they both actually use "test servers" before any patch goes live to ensure no bugs get released with the patches.
---
I would love to see that. Just have a radius where your teammates need to be for the XP gain and loot drops count.
---
Sadly as it takes a lot of budget.
---
Nawh, this was first game ever in my fucking nerd life i pre-ordered for full price, only because i wanted to be part of beta players. They won't get single peny from me anymore :D
---
From the way I've heard it T-51 is better for general use, and I think it's cheaper to repair, too. X-01 would be better for nuke zones on account of its radiation protection.
---
Of course, both will suit you just fine in most situations anyway. Personally, I just use whichever one looks best to me at the time.
---
Maybe its because gunpowder technology has been around for 800 years or so and it is mature while that for energy weapons has exited for barely a century?
---
There were too many occurrences of accidental damage and becoming wanted
---
They pander to those that shout loudest, typically that's the vocal minority. Reddit, as large as the community is, isn't a true reflection of the playerbase as a whole, but these communities drive the changes unfortunately....
---
On PC? I'm looking for players to play with. I'm a low level and haven't played since the first week
---
I think Bethesda only lets you have just one TSE drop lol
---
Because of the player vendoring.  Also when you destroy a camp the owner loses materials to fix it.
---
boohoo
---
Can you please do a server hop? In your world, my camp place is occupied and I do not want to close it up, I like it where it is now.
---
Nerf is when something is above the FAIR line. Fix is for broken things. The damage calc from explosive shots were BROKEN. explosive add +20% damage to your total damage, not for every pellet like it was before.
---
Maybe just charge less for concrete?

Sunshine industrial has a junk deposit where you can get screws and an aluminum deposit. Pro is you can also get nonperishable food here too.
---
There's a few badges where you can't complete like this, there's also a couple where parts of the requirements aren't in the game yet
---
Deathclaws for gears, wendigo for screws, ghouls for mix of everything, super mutants for steel, wood, gun powder. I have a bit violent approach for junk farming 😅😈
---
Just do the daily quests, and then Campfire Tales when it pops up.. Easy and not mind-numbing.
---
This is too good
---
I know of a couple of bunkers that you can camp in, although they're both a bit messy inside.
---
Farm ticks for blood it's actually quicker to make stimpaks. Butchers bounty almost always gets extra blood. And if your not already doing it use chemist to get 2 stimpaks when you craft them and 4 when you dilute them. Throw in a max level super duper and you'll be sitting on 200+ stimpaks at all times.
---
It worked for me. I have the badge.
---
You’re right with that but might as well call it an unnecessary nerf. Exp shotguns were doing just well before and now they’re literally trash even with BE
---
There is only 3 people claiming this isn't happening, and that includes you. There are far more people in here claiming it also happened to them over items you couldpbe confused over, such as a single gun. That either sells or it doesn't, there is no way the UI bug could cause an issue on a single item, it only is an issue on stacked items.
---
because .01 % of the population run around at level 200 plus demolishing low level bases just to piss people off. that means many new players are like F this I am out. 
---
  combine that with one shot pointless pvp and camp destruction was nothing more that a way for people to grief each other
---
   the more toxic and griefy the player pop is the less people play, the less money in bethesdas pocket.
---
Lol how do you know what I know. You should never assume.
---
If they do need money they are going at it the wrong way. They would have made more money from me with a monthly fee and paid dlcs.
---
I still have over 3k atoms. There is nothing I want on the atom shop. Maybe some base items but I would never pay real money for any of that crap.
---
... you brought up my videos. 
---
And the post you're bringing up is talking about my scavver alt, not my main. And as I said, I wanted junk walls because I think a scavenger would be more haphazard with their building and not have perfectly square, perfect structures. This has nothing to do with all characters in the other videos, or my play style with each character. I fully enjoy building all kinds of things; just because I want to be able to do certain things, doesn't mean I can't also like building in other ways.
---
There are all kinds of tricks I haven't used, and there are builds I didn't record. I started with the Seneca Rocks video because I loved it and knew I was going to miss it, as I miss other CAMPs I'd previously moved from. Then my brother convinced me to upload the video. Just because something isn't on my channel doesn't mean I didn't know it existed.
---
You don't have to attack everyone that doesn't give you glowing praise. Calling me stupid is unnecessary.
---
Seems to be bugged for some players. I was able to earn musician over the weekend on ps4
---
Bugged
---
thought camps were invulnerable ??
---
I was just thinking this. I remember reading post after post of "How am I ever supposed to get that gun I want when no one will take caps! If they do it's over 25k" now everyone is upset cuz they are too cheap. I get it, it does ruin the value of the weapons that were once super prized but there are still a couple and armor is still high value.
---
Mine wasn't. RIP my decon arch :(
---
Old trick.  Any member of your team initiates PvP, you get sucked in.  
---
Also, use this as a FYI and pull their names.  You don’t want to be accused of witch-hunting.
---
I am still looking my anti-armor drill.
---
I tried playing instruments in Watoga High.

I tried in my CAMP.

I tried in a workshop.

I tried in the 'One Violent Night' barn.
---
Nada.

Might try the speakeasy and the Fraternity House because why not but I am not holding my breath.
---
17600 with the right perks/aid items
---
Whitesprings is depressing. Its the lowest effort and grindiest. Heres some fun alternatives to shake things up, so you’re not playing on auto pilot:
---
 Grafton steel (tons of super mutants, rare plans spawn by armor bench)
---
Atlas observatory (challenging col gutsys, several legendaries.)
---
Events, still a good xp maker. Breaks up the grind. 
---
Blackwater mine: uranium fever event, lots of moleminers to shoot regardless.
---
West tech: super mutants, legendaries.
---
Watoga high school. Ghouls, plastic, legendaries. The candy event increases spawns but audio can get annoying.
---
What a struggle that was, thanks for sticking it out
---
I like to Google how to find x material. There's some good articles about where to hit up
---
I find 1* loot sells if it's cheap. 69c is my go to price for most everything that isn't rare. Ammo, scrap, skill mags, etc. I sell for much cheaper than 69 caps. Tip: shotgun shells at 1c sell well. Most people default at the 2c.
---
Yes please, I’m tired of seeing posts like this on every game I play and I’d love to knock one down.
---
I think there is 10% chance to get it from dailies and 25% from new event.
---
Same on Xbox. I just check back after awhile and its back. Just really slow loading
---
The 'bulldoze' feature does work, but it is limited. Like, it works by replacing a stone with an item, but it only works on bigger things like that. It would be nice if you could remove all of the weeds and small shrubs, so that you could have a nice, open area to plant crops.
---
Nah, I thank you for your help :)
---
This was a very stupid badge :)
---
Selling loot from WS ghouls (drugs, gold, and silver) is easy money too. I'm amazed at people who don't pick up all the gold and silver. No bulking required.
---
if you move your camp everything will be repaired and in storage . just fyi,
---
They have survival mode where you can destroy camps with people who want to pvp
---
Pesky squatters!
---
Well the chrome one has already gone for sale and is now gone after it's timed sale, but the Fire fighter ones, a fully red and yellow one and a red and white one have not come onto the atomic shop yet
---
They made them balanced around the core concept that they get around armor so their base damage is lower. Then gave enemies tremendous energy resistance, nullifying the advantages.
---
It's all because the way beth scales enemies sucks.
---
armor/energy resistance looks like this, scaling every 10 levels or so
---
10. 15/0
---
20. 50/25
---
30. 100/75
---
40. 150/125
---
50. 200-175
---
The way resistance works is based on **proportion**, so the level 20 enemy has 50% less defense against lasers, thus making lasers workable. But then higher level enemies the margin shrinks and lasers become equally effected by resistances as normal guns, but unlike guns can't benefit from armor piercing, meaning as enemies get higher leveled energy weapons become trash.
---
What kind of ”non drop rolls” is the legendary trader going to give? I’ve missed that part completely :D
---
Today I bet
---
People should just learn to think for themselves. The last couple generation of kids weren't taught how to do that.
---
They watch you tube kiddies and treat those opinions like it's the only opinion to have.
---
The world is full of sheeple.
---
Don't be a sheep.
---
Just ask someone to craft it for you people are doing it for free if you provide materials, sometimes small amount of caps for trouble.
---
I just hope that visitors will be friendly then :(
---
I just hope its something that's updated along the way to include them since they are part of the camp after all
---
The idea is very good but probably not gonna happen when looking at how slow even little updates are.
---
Nylon "canvas" bags
---
Do you have to do the kindling to get badges? Cause I've done that event at least 10 times now and haven't gotten a single badge. But I've never bothered to do kindling because normally it's done by someone else as I cover them.
---
Might have gotten sucked into a workshop through that random team invite.
---
We need like an ingame Instagram
---
I've submitted quite a few suggestion tickets about atomic shop items improvement (Silver Shroud included).. But so far I haven't seen any changes being made.
---
This isnt a farm these things out eight now type quest. It's a longevity quest as you play the game. I wish we had this scout stuff and vending from the start, as it would have been a lot better for the game in general.
---
It's better than 60k for a BE Lever ya know. I'm glad they duped honestly. We all have duped stuff. If it wasn't for duped stuff we wouldn't have shit. I just got my first TSE in 208 levels. I say dupe away.
---
‘If you don’t ask...’ and all that
---
My bloodied double barrel can't kill bugs 😂, non explosive shotguns are doing more dmg now it's like explosive effect reducing shotgun dmg.
---
Pretty much every farm and location has wind chimes which is aluminum
---
Yep, but it's only Weapon plan.
---
Indeed, nice balancing🌚
---
"Thank you for contacting the Bethesda Support Team!
---
We appreciate your report of this incident and will hand the details off to the development team for review." as always. :P
---
Ski poles give 2 aluminum each.
---
You can officially get a new set of military green paint for the X-01 from modus.
---
Did you play the instruments while in a group or as a solo player?
---
And another one for: Die and revive in water
---
Can confirm; I used the White Wolf fedora for the challenge and it worked.
---
Don't forget take a picture of mothman fighting flatwoods monster in a santa suit in a nuke zone at night.
---
Unless there was another gun that didn't kick as hard, used an actual reflex site and fired as fast as a minigun. Hell, just a .38 receiver for the minigun would be cool. A reason to use the rounds.
---
I’d have the first one 50 times over.
---
First of all, AN EPIC picture! Secondly, Bethesda should fix clipping with other clothes also, for example Vault-Tec Jumpsuit clips over hair which looks awful.
---
Sounds good but with only 24 players I doubt it would end up being a major issue
---
Wish we could take the pictures and hang them up in our house :(
---
Love the idea! All the duplicate cards can get annoying also. I thought there could be this system where once you've completely ranked up a card it turns into a foiled version where you can directly change what star the card it is. Once you've foiled a card you wont obtain any more duplicates of the same card from perk packs and all duplicates of the card you've foiled that are already in your perk stash will vanish.
---
If someone can convert this spreadsheet to JSON format I can make a more user friendly web-applet for this
---
People actually have weapons now they never thought they'd get to own, and honestly TSEs aren't that OP they're more of a QoL improvement as enemies are less bullet spongey.
---
Steam has nice thing going with their screenshot system. I can't wait to get Fo76 on steam
---
Pc users have made a mod that lets you have card profiles that you can just swap thru.
---
I don't know about that when I moved my camp the stuff was repaired, but I think it used my stored junk.
---
So, did they add you then do a team invite, but you declined the team invite and somehow able to kill you and destroy your camp cause of the invite?
---
Grounded mutation for energy resistance
---
I wish it would say if they had legendary items or not
---
I suppose, just my only counter statement is some of this misc challenges for it would work if we completed them as we just played the game, as opposed to go to a location and do something, which some of them have. I'm gonna give it a shot tonight and see if I can just get them as I play, not focusing on the quests.
---
Where do you get it in Watoga?
---
But you probably have to take a Screenshots of the photo like on Xbox. That's really pointless.
---
I never saw those duped stuff, just overprice 1 star weapons and 3 star junk weapons. Barely see buyable items.
---
Alright, I'll give it another shot. Thank you.
---
They offered a whole lot of potential, I do miss them. They've been used pretty well in 76, too. There was one place in the Mire under an electrical tower where two boxcars were buried in the ground side by side (with a gap between them) and covered with planks and such. Made for a very cool makeshift bunker of sorts, and I think the place might have been camp-able. Definitely inspired a couple of designs for when I get back on FO4.
---
Not to sure about it, however I'm sure people will accept you in their team over there. If lucky enough, one of them dies in the little water pool and you'll also get the swimmer badge part done.
---
There’s a location in the mire with two boxcars sunken into the ground and made out to be a home, it was to finicky for me and I also discovered almost nobody goes to the mire to buy things so I moved back to whitesprings, profits went up immediately. But regardless you might have better luck with the train bunker then me since I wanted an entire house on top of it which the pylon just wouldn’t allow
---
Thanks for the heads up, but if people want to go out of their way and be like that, it's more like douche-dar than a witch hunt.
---
The glitch was fixed, however all you need is a steep hill/cliff and you can stack them. My survival sniper has an impenetrable camp made this way post patch 9. 6 foundations tall, top two layers are solid foundations that even artillery fire doesn’t penetrate.
---
Take pictures?

On a related note, is said rock appearing invisible for anyone else? When it's a required part of the Campfire Tales event I can never complete that objective, I even ran into someone else today who had the same issue interacting with it. It was just a floating quest marker over where the rock should be.
---
Being able to place small decorative items would make sure a difference

Morgantown High School is a surprisingly good source of materials. Tons of plastic and some TV dinner trays/aluminum cans in the cafeteria, kitchens, and gym; cake pans (AL), hot plates, and kitchen scales in the home ec classroom; microscopes and surgical trays (more AL I think?) in the science room, and some desk fans, globes, etc in the various classrooms. It's not a huge haul all at once, but if you do it every day those things really add up fast. I also grab all the burnt books to sell for a cap each. If you go to see Biv once a day, walk there after you hit the school. Lots of ghouls (always good junk) and some good loot at that protest site on the road (the one with all the tents).
---
Monongah Power Plant - 3 typewriters sitting in a military tent in the parking lot. Easy pit stop on your way to somewhere else. Vault Tec Agricultural Center (yes, the noob zone in Flatwoods) has some typewriters, desk fans, scales, and a good number of pencils (lead).
---
Those are just the easy ones I can think of off the top of my head. You can also stick your camp on a spot with a junk node, hook up a collector, and rake in the screws and gears. It's the ballistic fiber you'll have to watch out for 😅
---
I agree it’s a douchebag move, but you don’t need any more grief due to them.  :)
---
One of them added me. Then I was using prox chat to talk to them, and he shot my a team inv. I was like ok, a nuke is coming in maybe they want to team up to go do it. Nope. They wanted to nuke my princess castle bed :(
---
So many posts in here at zero points... whats going on?
---
Spawn at the whitesprings service entrance then instead of heading forwards through the door to the bunker veer left up the slope towards the trees, when your at the top of the slope use the vats button to spot them there will be 2 plus a squirrel
---
Problem with dupers is they hoard their items and become the 60k sellers or sell for real $.
---
Watoga high school is a great place to farm plastic
---
It's the Bethesda tax. You want one bug fixed, you get another back.

^seriously ^please ^do ^QA ^and ^regression ^testing ^it's ^getting ^ridiculous
---
Wish I could post a photo here on Reddit cause I took one of the exact location you described 🤔
---
why don;t you kill the ones you find, jump servers, and kill the respawned ones?
---
Not sure either, maybe 4 or 5 star legendary rolls?
---
I found it! But when I fast traveled to it (or tried to) it wouldn’t let me, so I fast traveled near it and ran. Never started :( wtf
---
Harper's ferry and the burrows, try some events like one violet night, scorched earth, camp fire tales, free range, heart of the swamp, they all have a mass ammt of enemies to kill and there's always a few legendaries in each area good luck plus look for luck and leader bobble heads use them during the events. Luck will help with legendary drops and leader grants a boost to xp. Also look for armor that has +1 luck. 
---
Good luck!
---
I hope you named your dweller Jack the Ripper!
---
Aww, that's dissapointing. Oh well, thank you too! 
---
There are only two places I could think of - third floor of house with display cases in Harpers Farry where different recipes spawn or cook protectron in Whitespring, it sells recipes too. I never found it though.
---
The worst thing is after stimpak diffusor I don't even sure that recipe is implemented in game.
---
also, if you have a piece of armor that reduces weight of food/drink/chems, that doesnt effect our stash either
---
Yeah lol, or maybe 1 every 180-200 levels. Got mine at 180, im 277 now so only 80-100 to go ;)
---

For gears and screws, build your camp on a junk pile. It helps keep a steady flow. Since I've done this, I rarely run out.
---
You can't focus on your job if you're busy thing to tag everything in a swarm of ghouls, scorched, mirelurks, etc.  You also can't pop stimpaks while you're in an attack animation.
---
It's in the camp. You've heard it. You just didnt realize what it is.
---
Dick
---
Ah yes that’s a bug I’ve noticed. It will sometimes stay on the map and it won’t let you fast travel to it reason is because it’s not actually active but it persists on the map sadly.
---
Haven't got any of the mods but the backpack does offer a pretty nice boost to carry weight - overall it's pretty useful if you're not a Power Armor user.
---
Well slap me with a baby wipe and call me an asshole. That’s some bullshit!
---
That really is such an excellent idea by its simplicity, this could make our walls so much more interesting for visitors.
---
Check Super Mutant Blood Bags too
---
I think he only sold 1-3 star weapons and armor but could it be effects overlapping like antiarmor bloodied etc? Those would be the new god tier😄
---
Got one from a yao gaoi....  and didn't know it was worth anything...  %#^#^!$@
---
It does but it gives you a warning that you are at Max scrip.
---
Wow that’s upsetting I bought it yesterday and didn’t try and use it yet lol... totally thought it was for decoration
---
What system are you on?  Need a fixer plan to upgrade mine.  :)
---
They are fairly common though just need to check your map often. You could always server hop a few times to see if another one spawns for you.
---
Nah I don’t think so, could you image an Instigating Bloodied Two Shot Shotgun, that would be ridiculous..
---
Everyone wants them - if anything, I can only assume your post could have been downvoted cause we already know we want it and there's no need for posts to keep being made about it at this point.
---
I'm not a betting man but I think it'll eventually happen sometime along the game's lifespan.
---
The last rider comes today I think. The pale rider one.
---
Yes!
---
Cool, if one were to server hop should I stay in a certain place to start/activate it? Or just server hop until I see it’s already active and then fast travel? I really appreciate your help btw
---
dromedary + slow metabolism
---
I didn't notice the warning
---
Thats true but like if it could have 2 effects overlapping and then the minor one🤔just speculation
---
i know they don't affect the stash, but i guess i never noticed that the item weight in the stash still reflected the weight it would be if it was in your inventory.
---
The whole reason I went out and got one was simply to have something to fight back against those who keep grieving against me. Ever since I've got mine, the people who try to ambush me in my workshops have found a nasty surprise 😏
---
Just used the one at Watoga it was round the side facing the nuke zone so East.
---
I can make some. Level 5 snipers with all attachments on it, Level 30 harpoon guns..
---
I was thinking this myself the other day, there are done amazing camps out there now.
---
The infamous BE laser is the best sniper in game.. low damage?? LOL
---
That's awesome. Glad there are dupers out there or we would all be screwed
---
They take minutes to load sometimes.. The last patch messed everything.
---
Hm, maybe, it would ruin the duped weapons less valuable with much better weapons but they might just get duped again, wouldn’t mind a Two Shot Anti Armour Explosive Handmade. Like the idea though
---
A legendary fat man, that "resolute veteran" for 500 caps. Some others. Might wanna have a look
---
I’ve tried server hopping at each location, getting on here and elsewhere to see if people are holding the tourist, fast traveling, etc. Nothing. When you have roughly 2 hours twice a week to relax and enjoy the world (my escape), there’s better things to do. But being a 100% completion type, it’s a bit conflicting to just say to hell with it.
---
I hear you still can't in survial unless you attack the player so you can be trapped inside a camp
---
In game where every gun have ability to kill you in two shots you need exactly TSE to counter TSE? lol
---
Btw: Tse are weak for few weeks or months. Idk why you guys keep crying.
---
That seems fair to be honest, I just hate the sound.
---
I am Pavlov's glowing mutant puppy.
---
Dataminers pulled the list and there's a number of items that aren't currently on the legendary drop list. 
---
It's also been mentioned that the possibility of legendary PA and 4 and 5* legendaries could be possible through the mama grab bag as they appear to be in the code for potential pulls, though that also could be dormant and unused old code but there's always the possibility that it could still theoretically pull from those lists providing pieces that otherwise don't exist anywhere but the dev rooms.
---
You get a lot or ore from the Ash Heap Event "Breach and Clear"
---
It plays over the PA system right behind the scout leader.  Do you have world radios turned off?  If so, that might be it.  I like the world radios, and to a lesser extent, jukeboxes so I leave it turned up.
---
The miners have found an upcoming workshop object for "mailboxes" so this is definitely possible
---
Yeah I got one.. GT DrWattzo
---
If they stay gone you have to update a file IDK which one I'm on PS4 but I see this a lot on here
---
I joined a team with a random and fast traveled to their camp and I spawned inside it. It was all locked up and build out of foundations. I just fast traveled to get back out of it.
---
Why would you even want 60k. I have two mules at max caps and I don't even know what to do with it. It's not like it's collecting interest. Selling something for 60k would take 20min of switching characters. That's just dumb. 
---
As for real money, if someone else is dumb enough to do that then go ahead. Doesn't affect me one bit.
---
Those would 4-5 stars would be nice since they would maybe come with new legendary effects🤔
---
Oh man, THANK YOU!  I was actually debating skipping the Scouts on other characters because of this!
---
Forgot how time zones work?
---
Just hop until you see it active because it has many start locations throughout the bog it shouldn’t take too long to find one that’s going on. Also you’re welcome happy to help. I’m always doing Census Violence myself for the chance at more ultracite gatling lasers and assault rifle plans since they fetch a nice amount of caps with other players.
---
Also have some already made
---
Would be easy to compile a duped items list.
---
I know more than 30.
---
I just hit the Max limit last night. I had 6 more scrip left for the day and had 2 1* armors left to salvage.
---
 I hadn't noticed I was at 1000 scrip yet and went to scrap them. A giant message popped up warning me about it. I scrapped them anyway.  I need more stash space lol.
---
I thought with this legendary scrip machine and the player vending I would free up space. It seems I have more weight than before. I even sold ~40,000 caps worth of stuff and am still full.
---
Move your camp from the inventory screen. LB on xbox.
---
Ill give you one for 3 pemmican or 3 hotdogs. 
---
Honestly if you go to camp McAdams around 8pm in game and do the campfire stories its like a 50/50 you'll get the s'mores recipe.
---
I'm sure I do, but don't keep an inventory outside the game, my dedicated armor character currently has around 1500 lbs. of mainly 2\* armor, and most of it being Combat, Marine, &amp; Metal.
---
Don't know if they have new effects or just new potential combinations. (Multiple tier one effects for instance) 🤷‍♂️
---
But we should start finding out Thursday.
---
Ws.
---
Ah, yes, of course,  I always forget that distinction! I'll keep an eye out for a good gatling gun to add to my arsenal.
---
They've changed the button?
---
Right. I don't know why i though it was today
---
I’ve done it 7 times without getting the recipe lol
---
The Pip-Boy skins... 400-500? Did they not learn from Creation Club about appropriate pricing?
---
Yeah, i hope it would be like that so effects from same tier could overlap😄
---
I did stop selling legendaries to the vendor. Been collecting weapons from Wes Tek to sell also this golf outfits from WS. They sell for a pretty penny
---
on xbox has always be LB on the pip boy menu
---
Oh how I dislike people crying that everyone is crying. I'm not crying just making a post on r / FO76
---
It's all good.
---
It's a visual bug, and an annoying one.
---
Excelling then I can do it while I server hop and grind westech! I need those sweet sweet marine wetsuit mods
---
It was always that for me. Go to where you want Cosmo, open inventory, hit lb and your c.a.m.p. comes up. Place it down, open it up, ho to stored tab, place your assembled camo.
---
My uncle doesn't work at Nintendo though so Im not sure where that comes from... Believe me, I wish I had an uncle who worked at Nintendo though, considering Nintendo has the best video game developers in the world
---
Thats a graphikal glitch.
---
I mean I feel they should have some niche but they don't really bypass armor since hp creatures are so tanky they don't do durability or cheap ammo there really is no upside and then add in plasma weapons and wow theres a whole thing
---
I use Martial Artist Perk Card. Supoosely that card increases the swing speed. I can only dream about how fast the power fist would hit. But now I'm not sure if it is useful. I know you need bare fists perks to increase it's damage, so I don't know martial artist works on any melee weapon or only on one handed/two handed weapons?
---
Cool thanks. Dunno why but I always thought it was the other button. Shows you how many times I've moved my camp lol
---
No it’s not supposed to look like that. From what I can see your operative underarmor is clipping through the long coat unequip the underarmor and your issue should be resolved.
---
got my owl mask for around 250 and several of the build plans for 50-100 but saw some upwards of 10k
---
That is a serious run of bad luck.
---
 I'm serious about the pemmican by the way. Ill be on around 7:30 est. If you don't have pemmican its in my vending machine for like 100 caps.
---
Gt Plausiblewhale
---
Such a shame, I hope they sort it out, thanks for the heads up
---
You have sad emoji on end of post, thats crying! Don't get me bad, i just want to tell you very aggresively, that i can kill you with any weapon. So you don't need to dislike TSE weapons for this reason, they are not meta anymore.
---
Thx 👍
---
If you seriously are going to complain, go play something else, the majority of community enjoys the game, and welcomes change.
---
As I play 'min' I get one shot killed by these explosive guns either on purpose or by someone hitting something I'm fighting through area of effect.
---
No idea what you’re talking about.
---
If you see a good deal, buy it even if you can’t use it yourself, and flip it.
---
Manage you weight. I used sell the Mole miner weapons at Welch so I wouldn't have to FT while over encoumbered.
---
You can't move your camp from within the existing build area, go to the new location where you want your CAMP, open the PIP boy, and then Left Bumper.
---
I'm very happy with the game, take a breath.
---
Ah right, il so that, thx 👍
---
OP downvoting every coment that not support him
---
Plz mods plzzzzzzzz
---
I see him regulary on roar from Hopewell Cave to top of the wolrd !
---
This makes me think of hunting small birds in RDR2 and I don't think I can make myself do that again, I still have nightmares.
---
I usually sell serum for about 350. Allows me to make a profit and the buyer to use of sell to vendor to make a few caps.
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve gotten all the rewards for census but never received the shielded marine wetsuit mod I traded for that with someone else so it might be the rarest plan from census I’m not too sure.
---
No one is duping frag grenades.
---
I was cursed with a random encounter about 3 times now where 5 of them spawn at once and come at you full force, they weren't legendary but still was not a fun time.
---
everything would be 5 bucks or less...
---
I have a bloodied build, and I can say one pylon is sustainable with 20% hp, the correct perk setup, a medX and not many stimpaks.
---
I ve done this numerous times.
---
The duping exploits were just re-introduced last week, and I'm sure they will do another ban wave VERY shortly... and do that thing where they wipe the excess items in peoples inventories, just like last time. they already have the system in place, they are probably just seeing who is going to abuse the exploit.
---
try "the Fixer" I carry two one is a .38 small scope the other is a .45 medium NV scope. the .38 is the best best thing ever almost no sound and found a guy the other day selling over 4000 rounds for "0" caps. like thank you
---
I’ll be sure to let you know how it goes, I don’t have shit to do today
---
Oh OK, you were answering LoneWolf820B, but that   😏   is not a sad emoji.
---
Have you done the exam first?
---
I've tried to do the event twice and both times the pet rock didn't actually show up for me to loot so I couldn't finish it.  The yellow marker was there but not the item.  Only way I know what is actually supposed to be there are all the posts asking for one for our C.A.M.P.s.  Has anyone else had this happen?
---
Yes. It’s got a pile of updates and a lot of fixed bugs since the beginning. So much more content.
---
&gt; Wow that’s upsetting I bought it yesterday and didn’t try and use it yet lol... totally thought it was for decoration
---
I got caught too!
---
Before last patch it was possible to trade cams or transfer them by putting into containers. Not anymore =\\
---
You on Xbox?
---
That's my experience as well. These people just are not willing to mitigate their play style for the situation. If anything, they accelerate. It really smacks of, "if I can keep others down, I'm making myself even higher in relative terms". Or, as they'd probably say it, "git gud".
---
Alright.
---
SO even the lowly excavator comes in at 240 damage resistance. (300 with frame) 
---
Now 90% of all enemies in this game deal absolutely pittance amounts of damage. We're talking no perks no mods weapons here, so even high level enemies are doing around 50 damage per shot. Meaning the good old excavator is reducing it all by around 75%
---
The 454 (514) damage reduction of the t-51 is going to yield a grand amount of around 78%
---
a 3% increase in resistance, now this is a lot better than 3%, as it takes you damage received from 25% to 22%. A 12% reduction in the amount of overall damage you will be taking.
---
So in general against any enemy with a gun the difference between power armors isn't significant. 
---
What about something a little bigger.
---
The scorchbeast queen wallops on you for 220 base damage per hit in melee
---
Excavator will reduce her damage by a healthy \~55%
---
T-51 is distinctly better reducing it by \~63%
---
Offering an \~18% increase in damage protection.
---
Overall the difference between the very best and absolute worst power armor is not particularly significant, about 15% overall increase in protective properties. 
---
The margins between the X-01 and the T-51 is smaller than that of course. The question largely comes down to repair costs.
---
Ranked
---
Raider &gt; T-60 &gt;&gt;&gt; T-45 &gt; T-51 &gt; Exc &gt; X-01 &gt; Ult

---
It's really up to you what you want. The only power armor that doesn't justify itself is T-45, which is mediocre in defense, and on the costly side to maintain. The only possible saving grace is if you hunt treasure maps relentlessly you can get the upgrade plans for it free more easily than other T-series (meaning jetpack)
---
Perk: the swashbuckler. Equip a one hand blade and pistol with reduced accuracy.
---
I want to hang them up in my house goshdarnit!
---
Thanks! I'm glad I'm not crazy!
---
I really dont care if you buy anything or not. The vending is just a cute little dynamic to this game and no where near the core experience... It sure as hell is not important enough for me to rearrange my camp so that it is easier for the lazy.
---
Again, my vending machines are not that hard to find and if you cant/dont want to find them, then thats your loss, not mine. Ill be missing out on a measly 300 caps, you'll be missing out on extremely cheap goods.
---
If you cant take an extra few seconds to open your eyes, then thats your loss, simple as that
---
You’re wrong, sorry. Anyone holding more weight than Bethesda has allowed, is causing stress to the servers. The limit exists to limit the amount of items that the servers need to load at any given time. This server likely performs worse than a different server without any exploiters on it. I was on frequently when duping and infinite stash started a while ago, and I would crash when going near people’s camps, especially if they were in it. Bethesda has done the math and is slowly increasing stash size to see how much stress the servers can take. There’s a reason stash size has remained the same for a while now.
---
Did you by chance hit the sell limit? You can only sell 30 different stacks at once(any gun/armour is one stack but 10k bullets count as 1 stack also)
---
My machines are empty
---
Does drop from the new event? I know s'mores recipe does.
---
Yeah he’s talking early fallout 76 damage scales. Or he’s on crack.
---
+karma
---
'The Fixer' I'll have a search for one.
---
If you stash is not full then delete one thing while in build mode and it should work
---
Ohhhhhh buddy I like that idea!!
---
Never going to happen.  Consider all the nerfing to balance that took place.  Why would they turn around and instigate another OP issue on purpose.
---
You can do it this way, yeah. That's how I completed "photo of player wearing sunglasses in the nukezone" challenges. I stood at the edge of the zone and my friend entered it and died quite fast, but I still got the atoms. I think it might work with the current challenge too, you might not need to be IN the nukezone yourself so you won't even die in the process.
---
Not sure about the build. Swing speed is honestly the second best effect behind bloodied in terms of increases in dps.
---
A TSE would only be 25% more that, at most.
---
Explore, gather, craft.
---
Same. The event is super bugged. My teammate was able to collect kindling, I was not, and then when it came time to add kindling to the fire, he was given the bug parts collection task instead, and didn't know to add the kindling. (It was his first event, not sure if he COULD have added it, he didn't know it try.)
---
Yesterday I showed up to the event, everyone had already given up and left. It was stuck at finding the last item the camper left behind. There was a quest marker, but no item.
---
That's not a bad idea!
---
I could get on board with this - especially for Ammo
---
Yeah I know, but some change (in my opinion) needs to happen to reduce the worth of these duped guns, and I know I’m part to blame but I have an AAE RW that I don’t use as it just makes the game too easy, anyway I can only hope.
---
They added an entire basement
---
I think it's either a bug or your loading time is really looong. I checked these stations on PC and they show up for me.
---
They did not. I had to scrap items in my camp to build vending machines.
---
I would like to have more than 50....
---
Tesla Rifles. Tag an enemy and continue to the next. A whole squad doing this has easy killing potential, is efficient, and everyone gets loot.
---
Gotta think outside the box lol
---
I actually deleted a missile turret and it still didnt work. My stash is full but im pricing things from my stash box into the machine, not my character.
---
Do the events in the forest to grind out stimpaks and radaway.  You can highlight junk you need so it will have a magnifying glass beside it if it has the components you want.  Your best bet for doing damage is to use melee.
---
usually when this happens to me is becuase my stash is full or the cap limit for the vending machine is at 30 already. i hope it helps
---
You're right, it is getting better. Tully can tell most of us have been through the experience of protecting those bovines all the way to the end only to have them ravaged by bloat flies and sting wings while the sheepsquanch (as I like to call it) serves as a powerful distraction. 
---
I'm pretty sure the squatch is paid for its services with the tears of those wanderers who were denied event rewards!
---
Your stash is full
---
If your on PC look me up I'll be on most of the day I'll hook you up with new gear. and fix your heath problems.... mattola69
---
But im pricing items from my stash box.
---
Not sure then, i had that happen and i just deleted like a poster or something and it worked just fine
---
Now that I would like to have.
---
So many good looking CAMPs I found... and I hope, others like mine too. This would be nice. Even if my Personal Computer is in my living quater, not for visitors, I do not lock the doors... :)
---
ah the grind, are you on xbox ?
---
im willing to help you out.
---
I agree
---
BGS must have invested in the medical appliance and pharmaceutical industries that specialise in therapy for RSI sufferers.
---
hang in house would be cool. also I think having them shared on social media by players and such would help attract more people to the game or back if they saw new fun stuff. 
---
wild Appalachia was really cool now please let us broadcast it to everyone. or atleatt share to Bethesda so you have the additional collateral for sharing.
---
Usually every 2 weeks on a Tues, so not this week.  
---
However, the Legendary Purveyor is meant to be coming on Thurs this week, although no one is sure if that is just a "switch it on" thing as the location has been built for a while or whether it requires an update.
---
No, thanks. I'd rather do it one item at a time for that sweet sweet proc of Super Duper.
---
They want us to be "satisfied" until the next content drop in the summer with tedious repeatable grindy quests with little reward to them.
---
I want more raider like stuff, the raider outfits from New Vegas for example
---
Sure thing, I hope you get the plans you need :)
---
Yah the decapitated part made it feel very eerie.
---
HELL NO! lol
---
Remember all those drunk/naked challenges? Oooouuuf... Those snaps still give me nightmares.
---
All kidding aside - would be a nice feature. Have my up.
---
WTF are you talking about? Show me the statistics if your going to quite them....None of mine are duped and before you say how do i know...I know because no one would bother to dupe my weapons.
---
I do blame the Dupers but there nothing I can do about them, that's Bethesda job
---
K
---
Let’s all unite and downvote... everyone game?
---
Aw, nice. I'm pretty sure I've never seen one of those drop (also, I'm mutated grounded) but I'll keep an eye out!
---
If you reed it I never mentioned not winning. God please read it properly!!
---
Cool
---
I didn't know this. I will have to try it out
---
Okay after 40+ runs I finally got two one after the other. I think it's just a really low chance @\_\_\_\_@
---
It hasn't been disabled yet.
---
Thats your dad.
---
Won't know till we try, then! thank so much!
---
I also had this, moved some items from my stash on to character, and I could then price up the items I wanted to put in the vending machine.
---
No it isn't. it's just a few of you put you own bias on it instead of reading it properly
---
Go back to forrest and learn to farm aid+junk there. If you keep playing you will be coming back there wery often. I still have camp next to flatwoods, because it is great area.
---
Lets start with ammo. If you go from overseers camp south, u will arrive to some motel just before flatwoods, if you are looking on it from road, in right corner you can find gym. Inside are some dumbels, loot them all, you will have lead. Now you need steel, loot every damn item that you find. Steel is in most things. Last thing you need is gunpowder, which drops from super mutants or you can craft it from cloth+acid. If you are picking every shit you come across, you will have some of these. Now you can craft some ammo to survive next hour of playtime. 
---
Remember in forrest u can use melee weapons because there are mobs 1-10level.
---
Aid. There are plenty of aid boxes in flatwoods. If thats not egouth, run around river and pick glowing shrooms, from them you can make radaways. For another stimpacks go south from vault 76, there is one shack with tickles in it and lumbermill with tickles in it, those drop some item, 2 of this items = 1stimpak.
---
Remember to do events you come across too. This will give you aid, caps and maybe some gear. I was doing lots of workshop claiming and defending when i was low level.
---
Yeah I read that after I posted lol. I've only seen that when my stash was full. Try re.oving items from your stash and listing it from your character
---
while this can be a hastle, they are things you can do to fix this, why would you ask for something like this. you post is ah me me me post. next thing you will ask is for you to be able to sell stuff from anyplace in the map bacuse you dont want to FT.
---
I would be happy with that. very happy. even if it turned out some of mine were duped (which hopefully there not)
---
Ill do that
---
There are some crashed planes, one is in mire on trees, cool area.
---
Ill try this tonight!
---
The terminals should also have a log of things you sold in your vending machine. Very often I see/hear something sold but before I've read it the pop-up message is gone.
---
Anyone know the reload rate of the script, after using it all how soon till you can sell more legendaries?
---
THIS! SO MUCH...
---
Alternative solution: accept team invite and enjoy team-wide loot. even if there are more than 4 ppl teaming up makes tagging significantly easier for everyone involved.
---
TSE? Peasant ;)
---
I think this game has a pretty good tutorial that takes you from Vault 76 to Flatwoods and shows you the ropes.
---
From last inside vault you can asume Purveyor is already in our files. Just need to be activated like faschnat or sheepsquatch.
---
THANK THE LORD! someone who actually played survival commenting and understanding what the post it about. Thank you sir, you have restored my faith that There are some intelligent people out there
---
That's great to hear, man! It really does work well a lot of the time. We have an 80% great community imo.
---
While naked
---
Thank you! I kinda figured mods were the reason why I couldn't see the pet rock, but it was the only item I couldn't see so I wasn't sure.
---
Holy shit! I didn’t know that! I’m definitely moving camp next time I get on!
---
i dont atk anyone that doesnt give me praise. i dont care if they do or not. im actually eager to help people build camps and get ideas from other people. if i release things ive figured out, someone may experiment and figure out how to do it better. Same way i looked at a tutorial for stacking stairs, amd figured out a better system for it. 
---
I want to see cool structures people build to spark new ideas in me.
---
someone cant play raider anymore, lol
---
Thanks for the help / direction guys. I'll have to give it a try tonight.
---
I’m sorry for the False info :( lol the plan was right next to the pool table plan I didn’t even think about it!
---
Since last patch legendary drops have gone through the roof. Mostly 1 star but  still a good few 2 and 3 star drops.
---
They are dropping from all ghouls though not just ones marked as legendary. I'm nearly maxed out on scrip already. Hurry up vendor!
---
OMG I never made it about winning it loosing. It doesn't say anything like that. NO ONE WON...THATS THE POINT. IT WAS AN IMPOSSIABLE SITUATION and if people can't use deductive reasoning to see what the problems are then that's fine but please move aside for the people who can so we can fix things.
---
I think this is an awesome idea, aside from the Scorchbeast king one. If we already have a Scorchbeast Boss enemy, we don't need a new one. I think instead we could have hordes of SBs attack us as we venture in, killing as many as possible, which would also be more lore friendly. After killing the queen, wed obviously want to eradicate the remaining scorchbeasts. Good ideas though and I'd love to see this happen!
---
Yes sir
---
Theyre all good boys :(. Even that...thing.
---
You can sell that items for more to vendors, is there a catch here?
---
Other than the obvious pun :)
---
Suuuuuck. And there's just no reason for it. They're basically preventing spawning of more potentially awesome weapons...
---
For armor it's different, I am getting 3 scrips for 1 star armor pieces for example.
---
Turn pacifist on n it will not do any damage to other players
---
Mmm, assaultron 'assistant' in maid outfit...
---
Yeah I was trying to base it off that one idea he had. Hordes of strong scorchbeast would be nice and it’s offsprings as well. I would wanna see it happen but I feel like we gotta ask this. Is Bethesda really as ambitious and are willing to make something awesome?
---
Bone Clubs, Scout Armor at least.
---
It is area on map tho, so you wont be able to build there, but there are another cool places you can build on, someone said for example there is array dish in which you can build if you climb there. I have seen few ingame houses that were changet to camp, while i was traveling to buy something from vending machines.
---
Maybe it's kind of my fault but i always imagine what it's the worth in real money for what i get in the end and... Well. 
---
I said it in an other post - the balance between, keep playing daily and get rewarded in a small amount and even if you do that after a week you won't get a simple emote/frame. Thats a little bit off...
---
You can put on pacifist mode if you don’t want to activate pvp
---
This
---
Fuck Sake. you clearly haven't read it. I give up with all you people who put word in my mouth when I haven't said anything about whining about not being able to win!! I can win in exactly the same way as everyone else. That's the fu king problem. Dear God please save me from these truly stupid people
---
Ooooh, and how do I do this? I’m on ps4
---
Must have missed it
---
Agreed! This is the kind of playstyle I was hoping to inspire in others with this post!
---
Course I do I paid £160 for the power armour edition and have been screwed over since day 1
---
I thought it was me and my bad connection xD
---
There's a big crashed plane due east of Helvetia. Super mutants and Scorched are usually there, but it's a pretty neat area.
---
It’s done now. With a couple of my characters we shot our explosive rifles at our own feet until we died.
---
Alternative: make the rock tamable and watch him roll his way to your camp
---
Options, gameplay
---
Can confirm. Swim instructor is an asshole
---
It also counts for camps. He walked right through the middle of mine while I was there. Snapped a quick pic and popped the daily.
---
Yeah there is a tax for player vendor transactions
---
i wish they released some kind of hardcore mode, with no legendary weapons! and everyone had a fresh start, for those who want to have  more difficult expierence. i would play both
---
Tesla is bitch and can trigger pvp even after. I had somehow triggered pvp with guy in middle of event!! scorched earth, with pacifist on. Probably because we both used tesla and he had no yellow icon. 
---
So with fews bugs you can end up dead after using tesla.
---
Yeah as the others said, pacifist is the way to go with the tesla. I used to run into the same issue a lot when I was lower leveled. The arc likes to jump to anything it wants which unfortunately providers all the reasons for someone to get some free premium junk.
---
I can't really go lower than 2 caps per really because the tax will swallow up my only profit.
---
Yeah, love to have the Bloody boys on the field!! My teammate is bloodied and between him and my big iron, we can usually get close to that.  If there is a good group, then it's not uncommon to get around 3 minutes or so.
---
I think the +25 rad resist is bugged atm. Had a piece of armor that didn't add to the resistances. Can't confirm it after the last patch because I sold it.
---
Eey. Thanks man!
---
Just went and checked out the Bethesda site.  The legendary vender will sell 1 to 3 star armour, ranged, melee, or a 3* mystery item.  All you get to pick is the number of stars and category, after that it falls to RNGesus.  I think Bethesda is using it as a way to get rid of inventories full of misc legendary items.
---
I hate the perk card system it's so cumbersome and unorganized. Menus difficult to navigate have hated it since day one.
---
Aah yes. I found out just now. Thanks for the quick response!
---
Not exactly sure to the minute, but for at least :30 minutes or so
---
Nope. They don’t learn, and don’t care to, as long as *someone* buys into it they’ll always be scummy with MTX.
---
I agree, on the other hand i prefer stable servers.
---
Very cool! I hope your event mates appreciate it and return the favor!
---
Unlike in some other games (Dark Souls, for instance), there are no gameplay elements governed by armor weight other than the obvious: the defense rating and the weight.
---
The downside to heavier armor is that it's, well, heavy. The downside to lighter armor is that the defense rating is lower. You have to decide what the right balance is, but...
---
To a large extent, this choice will be dictated by how lucky you are--you'll end up wearing the best armor you find in the world, especially when legendaries become a factor. 
---
Add to this consideration the fact that the vast majority of the armor pieces you find will *not* be labeled as light/sturdy/heavy (the player is forced to guess based on the weight and defense together with any mods or legendaries), and I think you'll realize that this is just not a major decision. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Seriously, Flatwoods has so much good loot and scrap. Even at level 90 I still go there a lot.
---
If they did that I want my tse damage back to how it used to be. I would be back on a lot more than my 2 to 3 times a week now
---
Those that they introduced  back in by mistake are a big issues and has caused big issues but there are still active dupes. Reported to Bethesda  before the patch and not fixed
---
I'd also add a link in the description, since that helps tremendously. For mapping mobs, I figured as much, as the encounter management system (I think it's called) is a lot more involved than just mapping plants. Well, time to look around more. :)
---
I'm pc player so I guess Options &gt; Gameplay must be there.
---
All that would end up resulting in is everyone equipping whatever Bobble/Magazine that improved their primary damage as that's most important.  All the others would sit around unused.
---
While as a consumable, it might be fine to once in a while use an item that does something like double the amount of meat you gain from an animal, or reduce the damage from robots by 25% - as a permanent item, you are going to be best served with one that does something like +20% melee damage, one that helps you in the most dire of situations, at all times.
---
While it may seem like it's easy to simply combat the issue, it simply creates new issues.  It really seems like the big hang up is that these are bobbleheads and in past games bobbleheads were permanent.  If in FO76 they had been presented as anything else they would have been more palatable.
---
Maybe it was yours i bought the other day, payed 999 caps in a vendor machine, lol
---
Will check they stats later, hope it works, if not i still want them, they would have to fix the bug at some point :)
---
Yeah it didn’t make much sense to me as I never do any harm to other players. So it has been stashed for a good while now. 
---
Imma pick it up and start using some FC’s!
---
If this is thing, can i unlock every mod by scraping? I can scrap tones of things and get no new mod even tho i don't have everything.
---
This sub a week ago, why are caps so worthless, why cant i buy a god roll for 3k
---
 This sub this week, reee why can i buy a god roll for 5k, i miss legacy weapons being 50k
---
lol, yeah it was. if you would had kicked theirs ass would you wrote this post? chances are you wouldnt.
---
what is the point off playing pvp if is not to win the fights you get on?
---
and how are you going to fix it, again if you could fix the problem you wouldnt be writting this post. 
---
then ppl disagree with you or call you out and you get all hostile, I can use deductive reasons enough to know that you are just bitching about something you can't do shit about but to wait for someone else to fix it.
---
bye felicia.
---
I did it ten times yesterday and never got a badge. Is there a prerequisite. Do I have to earn a possum badge through a challenge first, before they can drop there. The character I want the back pack on is not my crafter. He can't craft anything but chems and ammo. Too many possum challenges are crafting . So I'm either forced to get perks I otherwise don't need to get badges . Or can I eventually get them from this event. I've done it a lot now and it's getting annoying. At least it's a good acid source.
---
That was a long time ago...
---
Click one of the posters in any train station
---
Ah okay I see. 
---
Thanks for noticing!
---
I checked.  Nope.  No correlation.
---
If you still need the revive I should be free later today around 21:00 (cest).
---
pn: Zephon85
---
I know about this game much more than you can imagine. You don't even know me, but tell me i suck. Problems in family, and you're looking person on whom you can release your anger? That's not how you do internet
---
Lol if you're still playing this game then you didn't get screwed over.
---
No trading posts
---
Looks to me like you're wearing Enclave underarmor. You'll have similar issues with other outfits, including the Silver Shroud trench coat and the Bomber Jacket.
---
Not mine, I'm on PS4 haha. I hope they fixed it, charred ghouls are a pain w/o rad resist
---
“Reading is hard” -thewonkiestdonkey
---
I checked.  It is not related to hunger or thirst levels
---
I do.  If I had the option, to at any time switch in an ability so I don't break lockpicks, before trying a lock I would. But that's part of the issue, there is a wide variety of magazines and bobbleheads combined. More likely at lower levels (assuming the idea that OP has put in place) I would have used the one that let's me pick a higher level lock so I don't have to have that extra point of Perception if I don't want, or to unlock locks at a level earlier than I can get the 2nd or 3rd rank of lock picking. 
---
As a consumable - when I find something that does that it's basically "Neat" and I use it next time I'm getting low on lock picks (and I'm notorious for being bad with the lock picks - never having more than like 7 on me at a time), so it would be very nice and something I would like.
---
Scorchbeast Queen
---
And, it happened IN my camp inside of a room with no windows.
---
Is this an attempt at trolling? It's gotta be..
---
They could incorporate a text chat into Pip-Boys and terminals
---
Hmm, that's interesting. In Uranium Fever (btw, would people get it if I just called it UF?), I'm almost always in a 3 man team. It seems like I get to loot every single mob, but maybe my team's just really good at hitting everything? More testing required, I guess.
---
You are looking up at the top of the lighthouse right? it will be on the balcony.
---
Very very true.   
---
I think it's people hoping that Bethesda somehow fixed the major gameplay design choices that drove so many people off. 
---
But yeah, the answer is always going to be "NO". If you didn't like the lack of NPCs or compelling quests driven by story-telling and interaction with NPCs. Then you're not going to ever like this game. Same goes for people who didn't like the immense grind required to upgrade ANY weapons or armor. Same goes for anyone who didn't like a lack of mods, or the fact that nothing you do actually persists in the game world longer then an hour or after you log out.
---
No, I read it, you're whining that other people matched you, and that you're just part of the same crowd of meta users, that is exactly what you're whining about. You and all of your friends want to be elite and you met another crowd of elite, you fell in line, get over it. Imma hit you with an up vote tho, just because you actually have yourself convinced you aren't whining.
---
not just you.  Happens to every PS4 player I 've talked to.
---
Bingo.   
---
That's a long damn download for many.
---
I've scrapped something like 500 marine various pieces over my countless hours since beta and have only ever unlocked like 2 mods for them. I didn't even know there was more mods.
---
Big mistake. Buy it and put it up for sale at a mark-up. That is a damn good melee weapon.
---
I'm not so sure right now if the latest Duping Exploit was a true Bug, or if Bethesda re-enabled the exploit intentionally, but whatever the case, the introduction of Player vending, along with the influx of newly Duped weapons, and the recent rise of Energy weapons has had a significant affect on the overall game economy.
---
I have been running dedicated Vendor Characters since around Mid-January, I have always kept my prices reasonable, and would only sell the most rare weapons and Armor for high prices (3000-5000), or more when they were offered up willingly.
---
The new availability of Items via player vending has helped bring down prices to a more reasonable level, along with many players having spent most of their caps in the first couple of days, this has helped even more.
---
I believe the introduction of the Legendary Vendor will have the added affect of most players cashing in the bulk of their 1\*-2\* stuff, and only holding the best stuff for sale to other players, this should in turn also help to normalize the economy.
---
I was able to purchase a very specific rifle from someone last night for 7500 caps, that I had not previously seen available for less than 20k.
---
Yeah that place is cool!
---
I heard selling items takes up camp space so if your at max budget building wise you can’t sell anything
---
you get the plans doing the sqatchgoat event or i can build you one if you are on pc and dont feel like working for it
---
Please don’t breed Douglas.
---
Yep it’s the Enclave underarmour, I like the +3 strength but I might swap it out for BOS shielded later if it gets rid of the issue
---
Constantly see it in /r/animesuggest too. 
---
Always something like : "Is [extremely popular high-rated show] worth watching?".
---
And yet it keeps happening with every release
---
Let me guess, another quest granted by a robot that doesn't change the game world in any way. Maybe it has an emoji inside
---
Yes the breakdancing ghouls are my favourite things right now
---
The vendor bots inside stations are taking a wee bit to load in too.
---
See armor sets
---
No prob
---
PM me your name in game. I'm about the same level but very fallout experienced. I'll join you on some of your missions and show you how to dillute your stims to last longer
---
Edit: PC
---
I have demolition perk and bloody mess stacked too
---
Heeeeeeeeres JOHNNY!
---
^ this LOL
---
Nah man, I think that's definitely not into a-hole realm. I'm 192 now, it's my preference to just wound and move, but in the end trash is trash. However, in my altruistic fantasies, the joy of the lvl 35 who leveled up because they got to hit a mob I chose not to obliterate keeps me on my knee-capping ways.
---
Hopping is for people who want to grind it out. If you wait for night over and over on the same server it wont be anywhere near as efficient.
---
It honestly makes no difference, as legendary armor perks trump armor type. The benefits of heavy vs light don't matter as much when it's a useful 3* piece.
---
1. It definately stresses the server.
---
2. it definately detroys the any economy for springs. The more of these duped springs that are sold into the economy, the more inflated springs become, the less valuable they are. 
---
3. If they have springs in this quantity, it's highly likley it's not just springs. This player is potentially inflating the amount of multiple items available to the economy and ruin any sentiment of supply and demand Bethesda had set up. 
---
4. Its mindsets like yours, "they aren't hurting anything" that lead to letting exploiters like this ruin online games. Its hard to go back. It needs to stop.
---
Truth
---
Wait wait wait....power user changes shot/core ratio???????
---
I ran into one at the model home. Let me tell you how happy i was to get that syringer........smh
---
It's called floating foundations glitch, and it was patched a long time ago
---
Not the gatling plasma
---
If you need tips for this event, you should just uninstall now. Its not cryptic or confusing at all.
---
Anyone else think it could be easier to read the things? Maybe make the color adjustable also?
---
Well if the only reason you're playing is to get easy Atoms then the game probably isn't for you, anyway.
---
Not really true, most sell for 5-10k
---
Luck of the Draw helps a bit. I finally started using the one I've had back around the launch. It's a TSE I got for dirt cheap before the energy buff (hell it was before people discovered the insane damage that was Bloodied). Putting the mod that switches the one beam into 4 makes it devastating. That being said I could see a non-legacy one being underwhelming. I have toyed with a full energy build (currently centered around Plasma Gatlings and this Laser Rifle) and I wish they had some more variety with perk cards centered on energy. It would be cool if we set enemies on fire like Perfect Storm does, or have a directed particle beam weapon (sustained laser looking effect).
---
Yup, max rank doubles the duration of the core, this also translates into double ammo capacity
---
Wouldn't this encourage boosting where a group of people carry a low level one? Maybe even for payment.
---
I did for marine armor and guns so i think so. .... 1600 bro i thought it was bugged so when you say tons not sure you've scrapped 500 straight w no mod then 500 more w 1 mod but it's grueling
---
Yeah. I know that. But it was long enough ago that I can’t imagine this guy has the SAME camp. But... maybe he does.
---
I luv u
---
This brings up another point for me. I run in a 3 man team, and we chat in a private group. Not because we don't want to talk to the population at large, but because we can stay in touch during crashes, character and/or server changes. I do wish I could hear my event mates too, though...
---
No. If you can complete it before the fire goes out without feeding itnkindling you can still get a badge. It's just a rare dop.
---
Maybe you put your camp in a place that random encounters can spawn?
---
Those people are ok, but sometimes they get on your nerves
---
How about under arnour? Is there 9ne which has the best avg stats?
---
I scrapped several hundred shepherds crooks without unlocking jack.
---
There has to be one foundation piece somewhere and stairs linking floors to that - the rest of the Base can hover though...
---
...the above impossible base approach can be a successful tactic for those of you trying to build your base into terrain like a cliff or something, as you can "hang" a wall off of an upper floor embedded in a cliff that wouldn't be placeable if there was already a foundation underneath it...you can add the foundation later.
---
Yes please, akimbo revolvers, and add the deagle so I can have duel deagle
---
Making then viewable as an in game item (like a photo album to place in our camps that anyone can click on to open the gallery) might be the easiest solution.
---
Seems to be down right now.
---
That's good new!
---
awww
---
I think I have that outfit, what’s it worth?
---
You are talking about a bloodied weapon. Total different story and even so its damage IS low when compared to other bloodied weapons.
---
Report them.
---
Yeah certain ammo types will sell, others like 5mm since you can craft 100 per a single craft, wouldn't make sense to buy it at a cap a piece.
---
shop
---
Could be worse.  
---
Mine spawn in 40 feet in the air and fall - occasionally to their death.  I had to add platforms for them to land on. (My camp device is in a tree limb.)
---
Jup that's it. Got my camp in the mire for month and 10 months in front of it was an random encounter :) I had supply drops and Lil side quests from it.
---
Ok buddy. If you really think the world is empty, go to a location with enemies. :)
---
There isn't always a pet rock. There are 2 different versions of the event and the camper supplies are in different places.
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
If you don't\didn't have the magazines already it's way, way too hard to complete it as you can't just buy the magazines off of someone, they don't count that way so you have to find them in the wild with less then a 1% chance of getting one.
---
I haven't found anything unlockable through scrapping for the free range items. I think they're found plan only. :(
---
There quite fast at least. They mop up Mole Rats and Liberators quickly :)
---
Heavy guns, are probably the best other than melee, that why I run them
---
That's a good point, man. We all have to be aware that, for whatever reason, not everybody can speak in the game. I like to think that the gamer group mind will gel for us and, via our emotes and actions, we can all help each other to a better post- apocalypse. 
---
Or at least not rage quit.
---
think i unlocked a total of 30 nearly.  Since they're labs labeled exactly the same but can either be for legs arms or chest hard to tell unless you know what you can and can't do prior then go confirm under mod
---
If you've never moved your camp device, you (the owner) will spawn in at the edge of the build circle.  For me it is always due north of the camp device.
---
r/asablackman
---
As far as I know there isn't a perk that will help you find hides.  Since hides are junk they don't fall into any of the search perks.
---
I would love a bunker or underground buildings. I could have sworn the latter was in Fallout 4.
---
Can confirm. The Purveyor is in the game files, ready to be activated.
---
Yep, i noticed it too, a lot of legendaries on WS, maybe preparation for the todays update.
---
Amen! Not visually impaired at all and I find it hard to read all the time. Most times I have to adjust player position or look at the ground just to open pipboy or see quest rewards cause they’ll blend in with the environment/sky.
---
You are comparing energy damage with regular damage. My BE Lever is like garbage compared to that laser. The Lever shows around 600 damage and the laser around 200.
---
Good job! This is the only Marine plan (chest) I don't know yet.
---
Only prerequisite is that you must already be possum rank. You just got unlucky. I would say I get about one every 6 or 7 events.
---
I really wish we could use our terminals in camps to check local trader for their wares without having to visit each and every one only to find out they sell useless crap or super-expensive items.
---
I think I spend on average 500 caps a day travelling around looking for good deals. It's becoming less and less attractive.
---
That is the only way to solve this problem, you would see tons of people complaining they lost their sent/cav armor, tse, aae weapons, but it would solve all their problems.
---
Alternatively, you could upgrade it to ultracite and superduper your other mostly depleted fusion cores. Then it wouldn't eat your fusion cores for your PA, and when your PA fusion cores get low you could give them a second and possibly third life as newly minted ultracite cores.
---
If you join a team and someone on that team is not on pacifist, you will go hot on pvp if they attack a non party person also with pvp active.
---
Update: Another one has appeared on the cliff overlooking the place. https://imgur.com/gallery/Sfh562c
---
LOL salty bullshit. People HATE pvp and never wanted it. I bet survival mode is 1/1000 what adventure mode is as far as traffic is concerned.

The 60 carry weight is nice. There are different mods with it to. One is refrigeration so your food doesn't spoil as fast
---
Yeh I'm a possum now I think, I crafted my +60 back pack.?
---
Sure they do I sold one this morning for over that it is all about the plan and how hard or how expensive it is and don’t forget the tax gotta make up for that
---
I think the Mojave and The Capital Wasteland we're the best, both of which are only held back by age/lack of detail. But the tone they set is so distinct. But I really love Appalachia as well.
---
But The Commonwealth sucked balls
---
Dude, if you dont have a point then why comment? You just admitted it has lower damage. The only difference is that it does energy damage.
---
Ah, ok.
---
Rngesus has no mercy for me it seems then.
---
Right. I’ve built a bunch of fairly inventive camps. I’m always trying to build seamlessly and neat.  I thought there was a glitch (like stacking foundations, now fixed) I didn’t know about.
---
Did you try putting it in a container and taking it back out?
---
If the plan says (known) you already know that plan.
---
You're accusing OP of selling duped gear, which is enough evidence to me that you don't know as much about the game as you think. Fo76 was released exactly 6 months ago, let's call it even and say that's 180 days. OP consistently made less than 1.2k caps per day on average, and somehow you conclude he made money off duped items? Where are you pulling this BS from? Anyone with half a brain can easily make at least that much in a day.
---
P.s. I don't have family problems, thanks for asking. It's vocal morons such as yourself who are getting on my nerves.
---
Oh damn I didn’t think about that... if something is for sale at 1 cap, do we just get nothing and the tax gets the 1 cap?
---
Me too, but even worse.  I can't even come back in because I keep getting the Disconnected from server....  day 3 and counting!!!  So frustrating.
---
Thats not how you become a possum...
---
If you have electrically charged and something hits you you'll damage nearby robots, then it's game over.
---
The max capacity one is so nice
---
Exactly I’m glad I’m not the only one. It’s especially bad at the enclave bunker trying to buy items from the vendor.
---
Re log when this happens
---
Too bad ... another missed opportunity ...
---
What else do I need to do to be one
---
I am happy for people to disagree that how a discussion works. What I don't want is insults as they serve no purpose...such as you
---
I’m close too! 47!
---
I have my level 50 power armors and guns ready!
---
I have a frog jar...2 in fact, I captured a frog, but it didn't put it in the jar, it's in Junk, whereas my jar is in misc, so how do I do this!
---
I'd like to Be able to, for a cap value transform out camps into settlements, bigger budget and bigger size, and allows us to get npcs to guard our base
---
Lol, I'm not bothered by it, I don't care either way, I don't like PVP myself. I'm stating a fact, I never said people love PVP, people complaining on forums drive the changes, right or wrong for the masses...
---
Nuclear winter seems to be a battle Royale mode, but there seems to be new quests coming with it too
---
You’re right, when everyone is equal it’s about skill not armor. Everyone was used to meta armor and mostly never die standing still, one shorting people. There was no problem. Now that people have to use strategy and not just standing in a train station they arent having fun. Maybe not op, but I would assume a lot of them.
---
They are a joke. I sell all the plans for 500.
---
Could be cool to get a bunch of faction stuff for our camps. Free States, Enclave, Brotherhood, Responder and Raider flags, plus waving variants of those (and the standard US flags, of course). Why stop there? Give us banners, posters, crates, barricades and whatnot with our factions' logos on them.
---
Let us show our colors with pride!
---
It's fascinating to find people find this game to be difficult early game. Nothing against the OP. Just never saw it as a hard game given it's mean to be a "softcore survival".
---
I finished the first mission that wants me to do the tadpole challenges. Revived a player , killed bugs , collected yellow waste . I thought that was mission to be possum. And I got the three required tadpole badges .
---
Our pip boys literally have a radio, these people are bonkers
---
this!.  thanks!  i was trying to do a quest where i had to find a way into the dam and im just. screwed where i have my camp. wasnt prepared to go this way i guess.  i started playing at release with my brother and just rushed through the first couple of areas and missions. he refuses to play now so ive been goin solo cuz im an akward loner. trying to play again after a long hiatus i guess i didnt pay enough attention on how to.. fallout 76 correctly and forgot key factors to surviving . its an extremely misleading game tbh.  lmao.  im also not completley used to the mmo playstyle. 
---
so. ill go back to vault 76 and starting areas and just reexplore and stash everything.  get my character healthy and stable. keep.. grinding... and stashing.. crafting and prepare to do more storyline quests. or.. something lol.  
---
is that the entire game though?? does it open up a little more? idk what im really even expecting.
---
Great capture!
---
I have to upvote this just for the weeping angels comment!!
---
I can sell for 9k with the hat
---
Just complete the main pioneer quest. The one where you show pioneer values, deal with pests at dolly sods, and 2 other things.
---
The Gatling plasma isn’t an explosive heavy weapon. I.E. not a grenade launcher, missile launcher, or fat man.
---
I've collected a few pages.  There should be a quest to find and assemble them into the book.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/lQmYzrU](https://imgur.com/a/lQmYzrU)
---
Anything less than the rarest of plans is 25c 75c or 100c at my camp. Selling like crazy and making a good amount of caps along the way!
---
Which makes it much stronger than any other non energy weapon. Which means that OP is just wrong. Energy weapon do not need any buff.
---
I did that, that's how I unlocked ability to craft the backpack
---
I have a full mixed sentinal assassins set, it's really great but as a pvp guy I wish I got a vanguard Sentinals set instesd
---
I can tell you know nothing about business if you think charging a monthly fee would be in any way be good and would go over well with fans
---
um... He needs access to the bunker to get the stimpack recipie... What he needs to do are more events in the forrest area or toxic valley. You get them as rewards all the time. Morgan Town airport also has a lot of meds. The responders quest that has you go through the airport restocking things gives you lots of meds. Or he can make healing salves.
---
There are plenty of dead humans, but yes I have also found a dead "Civilian" wearing Ranger attire with a note about joining the Responders.
---
Always found it odd that some corpses, like a bunch of the Brotherhood personnel around the crashed Vertibirds in Watoga are completely decayed skeletons but others seem like they're relatively fresh, such as the Responders in Flatwoods or the former Raiders living in Big Bend Tunnel.
---
Building an underground bunker would save a lot of hassle of finding a relatively flat area to build in
---
I just think survival mode should be straight grifieng camp and all if youre a low level and are in survivAl. Mode then you should get out . people complain to much about an in game camp like if it was that hard to rebuild it them again it was their choice to join survival just put survival mode back to bow it was and leave the little cry baby's in adventure mode so There camp wont be broken
---
got some peeps to play with now its just hard leading them into the game when i have no clue myself.  lol.   finally a direction to aim for.
---
This has been my experience as well.
---
I have the same problem. It says "prepare 15 pemmican". But it seems there is no recipe in game.
---
ALL plans 20c ALL recipes 10c. I know em, you don’t. Learn some shit homie. If my vendors are full I’ll even drop them beside the vendor for free IDGAF. this is a giving world and unfortunately I’m poor irl to help others but I can do it here.
---
I've got a couple &gt;1k cap plans. I'm lazy and go with MSRP.  Some of my power armor mod plans are around 2k and people have paid; still less than half robot vendors' prices.
---
The Forest 100%. 
---
Plenty of rolling green hills to plant your crops. Low level creatures that you can easily defend against with a turret or two. If you're not into setting up your own farm, there are several established ones you can farm to your heart's content.
---
You are alone in that opinion.
---
People dont hate PvP its cry baby's like you who cant do a PvP build thats what it is adventure mode is for you and survival should bebleft alone and if don't like it dobt join in the server simple why join then complain
---
You ranting about plans, weapons or people locking doors? The title is about the first, while the rest is about something else. No one force you to buy anything - you can argue, that they shouldn't sale those items in the first place, but that's how it works - some people can properly evaluate items, some have no idea what treasures they're selling for fraction of market value and other just don't have anything valuable, so put to the machine anything, hoping someone will buy it. You don't want to buy, so just leave and go find another one's offer. And for your information, there are a lot of plans I won't put to the machine, since they're extremely rare and valuable (Tomahawk, Dense Combat armor, Shielded Casual or Raider etc.)
---
I didn't do all the tadpole
---
You can only find the extra ones to make them at the tickets bench if you’ve found the tourist I believe .
---
Some of the same creatures you have to kill for one badge are also needed for the photography badge
---
I never said I was using tse. Just explosive. Lol
---
I get 1k for my jet pack plans. T-60/T-51b/T-40....some days they are hot sellers, others not so much.
---
You should be a possum then
---
I only did the three required
---
I'm sure they have plenty of good ideas for new skins and such that are ready to go live any day, but they can't implement them all at once as to not overwhelm us with choice. Adding half a dozen new skins a week is what appears to be their way of doing it.
---
Don't get the fridge mod it's pointless unfortunately... i was planning on becoming a chef in the game, there are 3-4 stackable food exp boosters if I'm not mistaken and with the new dungeon crawl coming up i was hoping to heavily grind (lvl 300 goal current 220) 
---
I did 1 challenge and campfire event the rest (yes a little bit of a grind but to was easier than trying to find my pet deathclaw (got him before patch✊)  
---
Lvl 50 backpack fridge mod - "lowered carrying capacity decrease food spoilage rate does not stack with good with salt perk"
---
Here's the icing.... ONLY 30 PLUS CARRY
---
😥 why Bethesda Atleast let me stack good with salt or change the name to "Cooler Mod" broke ass mini fridge more like it.
---
Main point to much grind for that mod .
---
now high capacity is a little bit better plus 120 carry however the drawback is reduced energy and rad resistance
---
Everything that isn't an emote or icon. Everything else is way over-priced.
---
Okay, but if you are smart you wouldn't pick up **and then sell** dumped items you found. 
---
I also really doubt that is what happened.
---
I can second this. I found extras in containers, but I couldn't drop them either. bummer
---
Thanks! I found all 3 meats up there! 
---
Level 231 &amp; I don’t have or want butchers bounty so this was an awesome tip!
---
I'm going to guess closer to 10%, but probably a bit more than that, based on the (perceived) number of times I ran it to get the 8 badges for my capacity mod.  Finished it up last night after doing little more than server hopping to get the event since it started.
---
Melee gets better as you level up.
---
My level 100 is set up as a bloodied build with 9 cards of gladiator, 3 of iron fist, 3 of incisor, 3 bloody mess, 3 ninja, talons mutation, twisted muscles mutation plus the bloodied stuff (nerd rage, radicool, adrenal reaction mutation).
---
That switchblade would do about 300 per swing for me at 15% health.  A plain meat hook with extra hooks mod does 1000 damage.  A bloodied meathook will do 2500-2700 damage and if I sneak and VATs, that is tripled due to the Ninja perk.
---
The key to melee is to get the strength up.  My strength is currently 36.
---
I can confirm that the White Wolf Fedora works (it was the only one I ever tried), and that another good place to collect bones is the spot where the daily with Treadly sends you to get a bloat fly gland (upper area of the mire) since the area is littered with bones and meat.  
---
A couple of the shops in the Whitespring also have magnfying glasses in them too.
---
All I have left is the maps, so thanks for the link to make that a bit easier. =)
---
Ghosts
---
Hey guys, can I get in on this action too? I still need to Revive an ally as well, and no one has a Mic or wants to group in the last few servers.
---
i was doing ok when i first started playing but my bro quit playing on me and it killed the vibe idk. i took a lomg break from it then was just lost tryimg to.. advance. idk. lol. no caps. keep dying. stuffs broken. 
---
didnt occur to me to just go back to vault 76 and essentially. start over.
---
Glad to help!
---
That's mad creepy. I would move my camp... Maybe even hop a server or two.
---
What are you playing on?
---
so much. How about under armour? Is there one which has the best avg stats or just stand out above the rest?
---
* Take a picture of the bulk junk scrap bug in a fixed state
---
* Take a picture of the Atom Store only selling cosmetic items
---
Actually no. I haven't done the "river gorge" one if that's correct, the huge bridge one.  I liked venture. A fair amount of obstacles and the narrow beams seemed easier to stay on than McClintock's.
---
I have a 3* power fist that does fairly well against the prone ghouls
---
Cool! I don't mind waiting or anything. I just couldn't find any info and I've been away from the game for a few months. Wasn't sure if maybe I missed something. Thank you!
---
In b4 poster comments.... oops... way too late.
---
You're a legend.
---
basically ive ventured into an area im not ready to be in and have my camp there.
---
Everyone doing the event is on a "team", it still counts.
---
I killed a bear sorry
---
Not even close to an easy solution I’m afraid. You’re now talking about creating a system to share client-unique textures with other clients. There’s nothing remotely like that in game currently (and very very few games at all allow anything like it). Every single texture/model you see in game is stored in the .bsa archive files, and everyone has the same ones. Adding photos means setting up a whole new system for users to upload their photos to whatever server they join, and them to be streamed to whatever players join that server. Aside from the potential for offensive content to now be uploaded instead (oldschool counterstrike sprays, anyone?), the technical complications are not insignificant.
---
The Pulowski Shelters idea is dumb, it's in the story that they just dont work lol and that's why there are are so many dead bodies in and around them.
---
I feel that the only thing is guaranteed is the item type and the amount of stars (effects) that item will have based on the price. Everything else is a speculation at this point. Wouldn't be surprised if we will get random item levels factored in.
---
I believe there are some mods that can change that. Check out Nexus mods.
---
I didn't actually, next time I see one I've not had I'll try that.
---
It was that way for 2 weeks last cycle, and the servers were populated due to it. This cycle is a terrible mess, I despise being headhunted by joeblow stealthboi with a Bloodied TSE Handmade every. .  fucking. .  30 minutes.
---
That's where your imagination ends?
---
Take a picture while lagging through the floor multiple times 5 atoms

only other mmos ive played is destiny.

and diablo 2 battle net.
---
Adjustable color would be amazing. I miss my white light pipboy
---
Nah brah, they are just trying to balance their chakras with a little yoga.  Not a great down dog, but they will get there someday.  They always all seem so angry so I definitely advise they get their friends out to the studio too.
---
yeah and somehow all over this post is nothing but you insulting ppl, and and you end this convo with and insult.
---
its all good I hope it makes you feel better thats the only thing you can have a discussion with ppl is by insulting someone. 
---
and if having a discussion is what you wanted then why not respond to my questions, but wait I get it you lack reasoning and as a last result you go to insulting ppl. 
---
good try bud, but lets see, ah yes you got your ass kicked and now you are bitching like what you are a bitch, nothing more nothing less. 
---
and we all know you are not smart enough to understand what im saying so maybe you can ask someone here to translate what im trying to say.
---
I will go slow for the speds (you)
---
but when I go (roof) like the dobermann said, I still think the (roof) would go over your head
---
lol.
---
Harpers Ferry Nuke
---
Yeah I’m on ps4.
---
It completed the event 30 times. No pemmican recipe. I think the pemmican recipe is yet not in the game, like the stimpack diffuser.
---
The nuke runs in WS have gotten really sketchy.  You go in there now and it’s a free for all so I tend to avoid it and server hop and do another WS run with much less or no other players around.  
---
I don’t need the goods off the glowing ones and if I snipe normal enemies it’s 2.15x the XP.  That’s good enough for me.
---
I sell all recipes for 0 caps and plans for 5caps and any unwanted ammo for 0. I used to drop the at the train station anyways
---
SO I have to give up 13DR just so that I don't have to see Bethesda's bad coding?
---
(then promptly grinds 20 hours to give up 30 ER/RR for 60 carry weight)
---
Really?  I may have to do a cleansing...
---
THere is not a regular keyboard on the ps4, just the on screen one.  
---
I imagine XB has the same problem.
---
Its a time consuming/tedious PITA to use the controller and on-screen keyboard to type anything.
---
Under the current construct: 
---
Options, R1, social, click, click, click...to an individual. X to select that person,  cursor to "send message" from the contextual menu. Already at 10 clicks, and haven't even started the message yet.
---
(Granted, the above series can be somewhat mitigated by aim dot at user, then on the the menu that allows you to invite to team or trade, add an option to "send text message"   but that only works if the person you want to text is in sight.  Out of sight, need to use a different method)
---
Then for every letter you select to create the message, gotta hit the cursor directonal buttons an average of 5 times.....  15 or more clicks to type a 3 letter word.  Plus 2 more clicks to exit edit mode, then another click to send.   Then 2 more clicks to get back to the main game screen.  
---
30+ clicks to send a 3 letter word.  
---
No thanks.
---
Good question, if is based on level, it will be a lot of work to move the items from my mule to my main in  order got the good level items.
---
Agreed. But is the thread for that?
---
There are some skull totem things coming though. It's something
---
Check nukacrypt.com
---
Or try putting it in a container, have your friend get them see if it counts for them.    
---
Or put in container, log off and have your friend take them, see if it counts then.    
---
Maybe it has something to do with being attached to a player so maybe if you put in a container, then log off your buddy can get the challenge.     
---
Then do the other way around so you can get it. If you're on PC I can help all this. I'm really trying to get all those mags.    
---
Even if it won't ever count right, I still want them all just to have the collection.
---
Scrap them for better lense mods
---
I use 3 pieces of vanguard and 2 pieces of bolstering, as I try to stay at 85-100% health. I don't like Unyielding bc I don't benefit from it at my health range and even then I don't think the buffs are worth for my heavy guns build
---
Agreed some asshat was selling a tinfoil hat for 100000 caps...
---
Fuck that guy...
---
I have a TSE Lever myself and it's great for PVE but with the campfire tales event I almost kill myself everytime. I never do PVP but I can imagine why you hate it
---
Yeah there’s videos on YouTube about it.
---
Perhaps it’s just stuff leftover from fallout 4. If not it’ll be in the atom store no doubt
---
I will start investigating, thank you!
---
he farts in your general direction
---
Ah makes sense, ye that is why I'm ignoring randoms inviting me to team, because afraid they will mess with my camp like remove stuff or move stuff around etc. Never really though of the initiate pvp bs.
---
The plans are sold at Watoga
---
I sell mine for 850 and am seeing the same.  Same for Serums at 175.  I think everyone will do better on the weekends.
---
Never said it would go over with the fans but that's the only way they're getting any more money out of me.
---
 There is not one single item I would pay real money for on that Atom shop. In fact I still have around 3000 atoms that I haven't spent that I got in game.
---
Perhaps try using BoS underarmor? I’m pretty sure it’s thinner than the operative underarmor and might not clip I cannot say for sure it won’t as I haven’t used it with the long coat but it’s worth a shot.
---
Seething
---
Please learn to read you little boy
---
What timezone are you in where there is a 2 day difference?
---
At one camp I visited the terminal was locked, lol
---
Aw crap.
---
Hah. I don’t even bother selling one star, I just toss them in for scrip
---
No way I would sell an antiarmor handmade for under 400 caps. 6000 caps is crazy though.
---
No, as a matter of fact, I don't want to tell you what's great about it ...  because no matter what I say, you just won't get it anyway.    
---
Done 8 of the possum challenges so far, and loving every minute of it. :)
---
A one star bloody supersledge is absolutely worth 6000 caps, pony up
---
You forget about server stability. Imagine how much worse the servers would be if Bethesda had to continuously change the map between a destroyed and regular version of buildings, and how they would just fix themselves. It doesn't make sense and would hurt the game play.
---
The sentinel paint does indeed exist but it’s currently unobtainable like the initiate paint. I’m guessing it’s probably bugged the same as how the initiate paint is right now.
---
whitesprings bunker, try every hour or so.
---
And each time you login to the game.
---
That's not possible... You have to have it on your character to price it and put in in vending. Remove 10lbs from your stash and try again.
---
Definitely not my bear since I haven't been on since yesterday lol
---
That's not true. The error message is confusing, but it's ONLY related to stash weight.
---
If we're gonna lose deathclaws at least give us a rock
---
already found a player in' piper' outfit. that was piper down to a tee. attire, hair ,face , all bang on. gob-smacked.
---
There's a ton in nuclear silos- which you need to launch anyway
---
Take camera photo of  3\* legendary that actually has a 3\* item
---
Oh thats disappointing
---
I hate reading notes, it gives me a headache!
---
Only a small level 50 boi, that's only 800000 bullets
---
Shielded BOS or enclave have the highest DR/ER, and +'s to STR and END, but I prefer the shielded 76 suit for the 1 STR, 2 END, 2 INT, and 2 LCK. 
---
It's more about personal preference, none of them make or break a build.
---
Yeah, I had a quad automatic laser rifle, it was really cool for 2 magazines before it broke
---
Take over workshops, or look for player vendors that are selling them
---
Also how do u get the faction thing by your name
---
It is... One of the posts or notes mentioned it was.
---
I haven't noticed an increase in weapon degradation, but this is what I was scared of about Repair Kits.  From now on you can't be sure. 
---
Did they adjust condition rates? Was it for balance? Did they just make the more popular weapons degrade faster so that some people won't notice?
---
Honestly, I haven't looked at the under armor I have on since I crafted it (probably 50 levels ago), so I wouldn't even guess which one I have.  I do know I 'suffer' from the same clipping issue, but short of saying to myself 'I wonder when they'll fix that' every few days, I don't give it much thought.
---
I really should look into that, just like I should probably look at wearing all that Sentinel's gear I've been saving up since I was in my 50's :P
---
I would pay some caps for a borrowing fee just saying.
---
It is disappointing yes, it’s the last paint I need to finish all my BoS paints.
---
Alright I'm at relief I am the person that murders people pets though
---
Most expensive plan I sell is 30c. It’s known to me so I sell everything in my camp dirt cheap
---
Sorry I'm on ps4
---
I just started to do this. What if I takeover a workshop I’ve already taken over before? Will I still get “quest rewards”?
---
Can anyone use the crosshairs on a lr rifle’s scope?
---
When I move my camp without storing everything manually half of the items are just gone
---
Exactly this! I can't believe that we play a game that we need to downgrade to be able to be fair to our teammates!
---
There’s a tall ridge by the monorail elevator that has a very nice view, can’t say it’s the best but definitely worth checking out!
---
I've seen the coat twice, but what I really want is that shiny goodness clean spacesuit I've only heard whispers about.
---
Get the Fireproof perk at rank 2. Little to no damage from your own explosives.
---
If you’re on a pc you can click “Edit Flair” on the right hand side of the page.
---
I list my 1stars for \[110c weapons\] \[95c armor\] \[50c lego 40 or under\]. 3-5 of 30 sell the rest end up as script the following day on reset.
---
Farm the hell out of the cave with the 2-3 deathclaws
---
If you are selling dense combat armor on PS4, drop me a line please!
---
You do not need to be possum rank for this to work.  A friend of mine who plays a lot less than most has joined me on this event many times.  He's done NONE of the pioneer scout questline, yet he gets a possum badge every few times he does the event with me.
---
It's one of those events that occurs in a bunch of different places. There are certain locations that have a decent chance to spawn 3 star legendaries. Others not so much. I'm not gonna say which ones, folks gonna have to figure that out on their own.
---
Everything breaks quicker/expires faster now with repair kits/refrigerated backpacks.
---
I've been finding and buying them for 250-300 and don't bother with ones much higher. 350 is actually still a decent price in my opinion and if I find one I want I'd buy it for that price. I got suuper lucky the other day and got the electrically charged Serum Plan for 1,500c!
---
You can also help other people defend their workshops.   You still get a reward for completing the event.
---
Any time you complete a defend event it’ll give you one from that places drop pool. For example at hemlock I would get the office couches a lot. Try to take different ones if you find yourself getting the same plan as a reward every time
---
You can still tame Deathclaws.
---
This is also my experience. My guess is you need to be at roughly the distance that some of the perk cards proc at (like rad sponge).
---
Agreed. Depending upon the effect, I'll usually go between 50-250 caps. Excluding a few rare cases.
---
What's even the point of over pricing one stars in the first place? You could either scrap the item for a small amount of scrip, sell it at an in-game vendor for dirt cheap, or leave it on sale for eternity taking up space in your stash. Making any profit upwards of what an in-game vendor would pay is a pretty sweet victory - especially when you can always go get more legendary items.
---
Personally I always try to price items higher than what I could sell them for at an in-game vendor, but lower than the amount that I'd have to pay to buy it back from the vendor. I think players should consider what they'd pay for each item they sell before pricing it. Hopefully the market levels out soon, but I'm sure there'll always be a select few over pricing.
---
Just got high capacity mod.. yes. very worth it.
---
Oh. Where is that? I only know of the cave with one deathclaw but his hide never drops.
---
Don’t fall asleep at your camp and move ASAP just look at what they are doing to these poor robots http://imgur.com/eogBCrr
---
The current level of the character at the time of purchase will likely be what matters, scrip is just the currency to buy, what level scrip is acquired should be irrelevant.
---
You’re right though you shouldn’t have to sacrifice DR Bethesda should look into it. It’d be a very easy fix as well probably. But I’m guessing it’s not high on their priority list right now with all these dupe glitches creeping back into the game.
---
Has this been proven?
---
Id also like to know
---
Nuke at Whitespring, do it inside the building?
---
Isn't it amazing! It's so expansive that you could be lost in there for literally seconds.
---
Now you will for sure. :-)
---
Nah I have world radios on. I’ll try to listen for it next time I’m there, maybe I’m just tuning it out.
---
Upvoted ... and ... "in before" the 973rd post about this, because it won't be changing.  lol
---
It probably has the chameleon mutation.
---
Yeah, doubt they will, they won't even add text chat for deaf or hard of hearing. So if you can't use voice chat you are stuck playing solo. It is ridiculous and pretty sure illegal in the EU to not offer text for people who can't hear.
---
YES!!! PLEASE!! 
---
The vertical half walls would be a godsend to fill in gaps
---
I built a big maze but at certain pints there is no option but to leave the vertical half walls slots empty, i would love the vertical half walls
---
we already have horizontal half walls, so please add vertical half walls
---
 /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
It sure is the most varied, at least visually, it's just that a lot of the locations are very lacking in content.
---
I got from 47 to 60 in the last 2 days, only farming nuked whitesprings. And i didn't even played that long, maybe 2-3 hours sessions only doing it with one friend. If you know exactly where to go and the respawn helps, you're looking to make a lot of levels fast.
---
As I understand certain armours have varying levels of different damage protection.
---
Leather Armour has great energy resistance and will keep you safe from most low-level robots and mid-high level supermuntans which use laser-based weapons, but Against enemies that use conventional bullets or non-energy base melee (most low-level melee weapons), you'll lack defence.
---
On the other side of the Coin, there's heavy metal armour. It will stop bullets but energy attacks will rip right through you.
---
Right down the queens crack is combat armour it is pretty good at protecting both types but it is very heavy, It is a happy middle balance between metal and leather but not as good in raw defensive power. 
---
**your question is answered here**
---
Anyways in a game that revolves around collecting junk, weight management is crucial. so while a full suite of heavy combat armour will net you the overall greatest defence. after your guns, ammo for them, and chems. you won't have any weight left to pick up the junk your trying to get. you'll survive but that one desk fan won't of made your trip worth it.
---
Power armor is a nice workaround, and now that backpacks are in the game is alittle better. but my scout ranger is my favorite way of dealing with the wight system. I wear weight-reduced/shadowed study/light leather and metal armor depending on the place I'm going. combine that with perks that increase sneak and vats crits, plus junk shield and weight reducing perks, and I can runs where I can easily bring back 190 pounds of raw material. but excavator power armor is still objectively better
---
tl;dr The game is about collecting junk to upgrade your shit, better armor is heavy. Better Armour = Heavier armor = less junk.
---
I believe but could be wrong on this but the wood, trapper, raider, robot, and scout, armours. are just either beefier/lighter versions or remodels of the base three types. For example, the robot armour is heavier and has better protection than metal and as well as some decent energy resistant.
---
Bethesda's website?
---
I'd triple their durability but make their repair materials more rare.  Maybe even require Assaultron circuit boards (In game reason:  since they are the only boards available with the right capacitors.)
---
I wish they'd stop futzing around with weapons and balance armor.  Armor should be good at Ballistic Or melee Or Energy, or OK but not at all great against all 3.
---
The cave where you starry the brotherhood mission I think
---
I had a camp up that way before it’s a pretty cool view. I was at a camp yesterday at the top of a cliff south east of harpers ferry it was pretty nice overlook of the town. Another place that’s nice is towards the top of the map, south of the winding wind palace (sorry if that’s the wrong name) it overlooks like half the map, super nice green area
---
Whiners gotta whine about something.
---
There is a robot raider faction. You just don't get to join them. 
---
Should Bethesda really have reused an idea in 2 separate dlc?
---
They are instanced so people scavenging for them won't make them less rare. Yeah just keep an eye out. It's unfortunate you can't sell them, I have four or five now.
---
the weapons I use do better damage than the enemy specific ones. Hunter's or Zealots would be a downgrade.
---
I don't recall it if was on their forum or here or in the notes about the vendor. But Valseek said it was leveled. By time I'd find the info, it'll be the 16th and you'll know for sure.
---
Marine under armour has lining upgrades that are pretty good, Other than that Enclave or the shielded vault suit.
---
hmmm strange... i wonder how that can happen? but, im glad its better for you!
---
I’m dumb. I didn’t think about 0c. My only fear is some asshole who knows them will buy them to resell even at 10c. I’ll server hop small low level camps and drop junk, ammo, and sometimes low lvl guns for them to sale or part out of Iv hit my cap limit for the day.  I’m lvl 87 and did so on my own since beta. Id Atleast like to help some of the lows out so it’s not a constant grind. I remember I spent 1 entire weekend trying to get adhesive. I don’t want them to have to do that. Go out and explore my man/woman
---
I found out that you need empty milk bottles to be able to get the milking part of that badge last night.
---
Thanks for telling me, didn't know that. I'm still converting from a PA Melee to a Sneak Rifle build. Also heard that Demolition Expert works for the explosive weapons but I'm not sure if it's still like that
---
I’ll give ya 25 or so camp plans for 500 caps. Really just want the weight reduction.
---
I thought The Pack was the best of the 3. 
---
And there already was a robot raider faction. Were they supposed to reuse ideas in separate dlc?
---
The hundreds of plans I had in my stash, are still in my stash.
---
Thanks heaps, BGS, for making the plans I've spent months accumulating for vending useless, by making them all available at vendor bots for 100c.
---
I love it. I ran around yesterday just checking out peoples camps and taking photos of things. One dude had his machine full of captured frogs. Haha
---
Serums aren't selling well for you at 175 caps? That's crazy. I don't have the plans myself, but I'm always happy seeing serums at &gt;300.
---
Update is coming on Thursday, we should get an atom shop update today though.
---
I think it’s been the best thing added to the game. Maxed caps so much quicker and after around an hour I switch servers for new business. Absolutely brilliant in my opinion.
---
The going price for mutation serum recipes is 3500. I would also charge a high price on any extra prime .50 or gatling gun plans I receive. Those can help a lower level (50-80) player contribute meaningfully to the SBQ fight and perhaps even complete it for the first time.
---
What system are you on?
---
Not as bad as a few months ago, but a notable increase in server disconnects lately...
---
I'm drawing a blank here. What faction was that, and which two DLC are we talking about again?
---
I'm selling a single action revolver ivory grip for 25k. One day someone will accidentally buy it. One day
---
Everything you're selling *is* in storage. It never leaves your stash.
---
I’m on Xbox, I contacted support and they said there’s nothing they can do :’(
---
I second this, would be nice to see more detail on what people are selling, see if it's worth the caps to fast travel over there.
---
Well after hopping on for the first time in months, I get on and notice a players home on the railroad in Harper's ferry, I walk inside and it's basically a mega grow room and to my surprise there were vending machines with plans that I never heard of. I bought them all and now I'm hyped.
---
Yeah dude it’s funny but getting kinda irritating lmao
---
It took me way more time, I like exploring, I don’t really like Whitesprings, it’s too crowded and too clean.
---
I just go on a road trip exploring, looting, killing and doing quests.
---
But I have to be honest, I want to use my camo PA! xD
---
yeah, that's the worst problem, i dont care in a nuke zone, always use my PA then, but those "normal" charred ghouls are a pain when in armor :)
---
In some way yes, but the good stuff is overpriced on “thirds party places”
---
nope nope nope
---
I don't think you need to be possum rank unless they changed something with that server downtime they had on Friday or whenever.  I had 4 possum badges before I had gotten my second tadpole badge for doing the 3 world tadpole badges.  I was of course then an idiot and bought the possum backpack not realizing it was a skin.
---
i would also like to change the color. not to take away from you suggestion.
---
Didn’t know it was possible with a 25k cap to sell for 4x that 🙃
---
Yup. Happened to me on PS4. Had some internet issues on my end, and got disconnected...came back and everything was in storage. Just had to reassign everything. Nothing got lost, so no biggie in the long run...just annoying.
---
The player vending itself is great, the bugs that came with it not so much. It got delayed but still has some serious bugs. We can't inspect items which makes selling and buying 3* gear basically impossible. I spawn very often inside the walls snd cannot move at all and there's also a visual bug when you sell something
---
The defensive stats are so low that I don't think they're worth taking into account; you should choose your underarmor based on the SPECIAL stat boosts. Each underarmor can be improved to increase the stat bonuses; in increasing order of effectiveness, the improvements are Treated, Resistant, Protective, and Shielded.
---
Your options are the following, with the stats given for the Shielded upgrade:
---
Enclave (Urban/Forest Operative): 3 Str, 2 Per
---
Vault (Vault Suit, VTU suit): 2 Str, 2 End, 2 Int, 1 Lck
---
Marine (Marine Wetsuit): 2 Str, 2 End, 2 Per
---
Raider (Harness, Raider Leathers, Road Leathers): 3 Per, 3 Agi, 1 Lck
---
Brotherhood (Brotherhood Knight/Officer/Soldier, Brotherhood Fatigues): 2 Str, 3 End
---
Casual underarmor (Military Fatigues, T-Shirt and Jeans, etc.) is also in the game, but the two highest tiers, Protecting and Shielded, are inobtainable because ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Bethesda.
---
To obtain the plans fo the underarmors...
---
Enclave: sold by the bunker vendors; purchase one tier to make the next one available.
---
Vault: given as quest rewards as the player follows the Overseer's journey. 
---
Marine: potential event reward for Census Violence (and possibly other Bog events)
---
Raider: potential event reward for Uranium Fever (and possibly other events)
---
Brotherhood: possible reward or turning in Technical Data.
---
Marine and Raider don't need to be obtained in order.
---
You need to unequip and equip it again for the numbers to be updated.  I notice this too earlier
---
This is what the 10% tax is for a the postal system. I just imagine a super mutant with a canvas messenger bag running up and handing you a desk fan.
---
Lol.
---
Same here. And then scrapped more decorations just to be able to stock the machine.
---
This 100% !!!
---
It's only x16 times the detail!!
---
He means it becomes unassigned from the vending machines.
---
Interesting idea...... probably not feasible but just had a random thought. Make the Carry weight perk cards mod-able into the backpack. The stronger the pack, the more "perk Mods" you can add. Up to 3. Make it locked behind a difficult challenge too.
---
Apparently they either got re-introduced (old fixes got overwritten), or a new version has been found.  But yes, there seems to be a working dupe method going on right now.  I haven't verified (duh), but I'm aware of the method, and it rings true from the descriptions I've seen.
---
SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL
---
make their repair materials rare then sell repair kits for real money
---
Oh,I had no idea it was like that before. Wonder why they changed it then
---
I was under impression that deathclaws don't drop deathclaw hides. You have to find them randomly on gulper bodies, footlockers and meatbags. Anybody get a deathclaw hide drop from a deathclaw corpse?
---
Just use the ones that are beneficial to you
---
WHY ARE WE YELLING
---
PS4
---
I’d rather have a way to raise the volume on holotapes, they’re so hard to hear
---
Damn, maybe someday they will get rid of those for good🤟
---
I think what people don’t realize is that CHARISMA is what determines your drop chance for the badge just like other “end game” loot. I was getting a badge in like one in ten events (I had a cha score of 5) and then started stacking charisma consumables and it went a little better.
---
They are timed correct?
---
I was just posting in another reply related to this.  It's an interesting mechanic, and I'm not sure what the accurate description actually is, tbh.
---
In my case, I'm typically in a team of 3 when we go into Uranium Fever.  When the even starts, everybody is visually labelled as 'team', i.e. their names change to yellow.
---
My experience has been that the event treats all attendees as team members in regards to loot/xp.  That is to say, if anybody in the event kills a mob, I can go loot it.  However, I have to damage a mob to get xp.
---
Another /u/ states that this is not the case.  Somebody on your 1-4 man team has to hit the mob for you to get looting rights.
---
But, I don't loot during UF, only after.  And it is my recollection that I am able to loot every corpse.  So, unless my team is exceptionally good at tagging every mob that spawns, I'm pretty sure the game mechanics treat all players in the event at team members while the event is on.
---
This is supported by the fact that sometimes a wave of mole miners comes in after the event is done, the event 'team' is disbanded, and if I or mine are not there for that fight, I can't loot those mobs.
---
Successful in my opinion. Some people need to learn how to price and what they should actually sell to be successful but ive made some great finds! Alot of things ive never been able to find before. 
---
One thing that bothers me is the lack of patience of some people. Cutting lines and stabbing people because they are impatient. I actually had someone stab me over and over simply because i was trading with someone else. Then he picked a fight with everyone at my camp because i refused to trade with him. People need to chill out and be respectful. I wish there was a way to kick people out of your camp.
---
You just built vending machines and added them to your camp. That's an item that's more complex than turrets being added to every camp in the game. It's a huge undertaking in terms of the likely strain on the databases.
---
Because it isn’t
---
I'm not the biggest fan. Overpricing and camp hopping just isn't fun.
---
I sell loads of serums and I have the price at 650. I sell them at that price because it makes no difference if they sell or not, I’ll get 500 at the vendor
---
Don't forget Flatwoods Monster and the Wendigo.
---
Each one is an hour I think
---
Your not understanding everthing wasn't for sale anymore and camp not showing on map
---
Hmm. OK. Though I was at the max budget already before I added mine.
---
I found someone selling a ton of chems/aid/nades for 1 cap/item...
---
Literally bought everything for a cap and immediately flipped it at WS Station for a healthy profit.
---
Yea about 90% of my plans sell at 25c with a few rarer or more expensive ones at 50c. Then i sell the ultracite power armor and recievers at 100+.
---
Seriously? I still see plans for thousands of cops everywhere. We playing the same game? Man I suck at this game.
---
Sell them for 50, you’ll literally make thousands
---
Spawn and inspect are my biggest issues with vending.
---
ohhhhhh... you know I've done that for other bugged gear, didn't think to do it this time. Duh.
---
I mean I get racial slurs, but banning those is fine, we should be free to comment
---
I really enjoy it but think some people are out of their mind with prices. Going straight off of what the value says and not what people will pay. And some just asking ridiculous prices for some things. Like 25k for a dog helmet, 200 for pastor vestments and straight jackets.
---
Sell them for less than 100c? 
---
I mean...you almost HAVE to undercut bot vendors for any chance of someone buying crap
---
Idk I’ve only ever seen 3 ACBs. That might be a little too rare. I’d be ok with it taking more materials per repair as long as you can get through an entire excursion without them breaking.
---
Use them if you care for Atom challenges. You need to use 20 different ones for one challenge and then another unlocks for you to use 76 total bobbleheads for even more atoms.
---
Ya if this happens and you have 120 things for sale Ohhh boy that would be game changing who wants to keep putting that many things up for sale I would just stop selling
---
I'm on pc but I appreciate it
---
I'm on pc
---
I wonder if by play they mean get the well tuned effect.  I'll have to test this when I get a chance to.
---
Server hopped for 3 hours 3 nights ago found 3 deathclaws (lvl 21) which I couldn't tame and suspect a bug with the untagging of animal disallowing taming even with wasteland wanderer. [More detail  here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blra0h/fallout_76_wild_appalachia_patch_9_notes_may_7/en0mqav/?context=3)
---
spooky. as. fuck.
---
Yes I know this.. doesn’t seem like the above does
---
Fallout Wheeping Angels.
---
Don't blink
---
bad wolf... this guy doctor who's!
---
Nope.  But it is worth 1500.
---
I also have tons of cheap plans for camp on PS4. If interested.
---
This is exactly what I hate about the repair kits.  Now every discussion about repair turns into a revenue discussion.  And rightly so.
---
I've posted it over and over since they were announced:  I don't care that they are so cheap, that you can earn better ones in game, now you can't adjust anything condition related without it being tainted by the thought, "Was the shop not hitting revenue targets this month?"
---
Yeah that’s my point he’s one *those* people
---
This is brilliant. Allows you to really tweak your build, wants you to search for something else to become more versatile, but doesn't make anybody OP.
---
Eating magazines should and bobbleheads should unlock something to fill this slot, et voila, they now finally have any value besides being duped and stacked, I suppose this made em usefull at least to some dimwits who can't win the legit fight. 
---
Fallout consumables were to be food aid and drugs. Bobbleheads were supposed to give you potential advantage upon unlocking.
---
This happened to me last night, it looked like a carpet off ghouls rolling toward me lol
---
I expect the item to match the player level.
---
I think I have, and junk extractors?
---
This already happens in 76 regardless of this request. Basically we are all suffering to prevent something that is happening anyway.
---
Nope
---
Oh I know.. but they say the look at this thing all the time..  so I am going to put something every single day they do.. well I dont care if it get downvoted... but if they do really care about the people who play this game.. and if nothing is done then they are only hurting themselves
---
Ha! I reckon I’d need the top hat for that!
---
I based him on characters like Dr Decker from Nightbreed, Leatherface and The Strangers.
---
I actually make short videos from footage I capture in-game and dub with audio from horror/thriller movies...
---

---
"... I'm not going to pay ..."
---
And you don't have to. Freedom is great, isn't it?
---
Depends on the location, I've made quite a bit of caps out there. It helps to have a camp near an event location
---
yeah i agree, i bet Bethesda would make MORE atom sales if they just lowered the prices...no way im gonna pay $12 for a PA skin
---
You can find a broken ProSnap camera in toolboxes rarely now.
---
I have been seeing this happen on a ton of posts. Jt is pretty strange.
---
By the way if you are ever in NY and need some tile work done you can look up my business. Custom Tile Solutions.
---
I actually have no idea how much it's worth but I know it's valuable. Mine got gifted to me by a duper so...
---
I only have a few things that are really up there in price, 7k for a serum recipe and 17K for a quad explosive radium rifle  everything else is pretty much under in game market value (besides legendaries, they are typically under player market value)
---
Happened to me on xbox
---
As a temporary buff they are something I neglected from day one and day one was before the beta for me. This idea would finally make me remotely interested in bobbleheads and magazines.
---
Ah shit sorry added an extra zero by mistake, my bad.... point still stands though.
---
We also need a viable builds thread, Id love to get back in the game but have no idea what builds work and which are nerfed to all hell.
---
Thanks... love the original Photo Mode!
---
It's under the Effects audio setting
---
Haha
---
I got both outfit parts from someone who sold them to the whitesprings vendor
---
I sell mine at 299 and it's gotten to a point they are hard to keep in stock.
---
We need Fallout 76 to be like a Facebook or Instagram. End game is already only taking selfies so why not.
---
Set aside instigating, bloodied, AA levers and handmades.  Those are worthwhile to others.
---
i just don’t understand why they f people shoot, swing, chase, and bite so much at the INVINCIBLE laser face !
---
like it’s fing invisible and impervious 
---
yet they sit and die over and over and over again 
---
i always wondered who could be that dense to just show up to be fodder ..
---
like obviously the person knows how to access events and has survived thus long leveling up, being part of the community, but what the f gives them the impression of damage 😓
---
(and they don’t even realize it til the real OG DPS crew capitalizes)
---
I have stood there and let a legendary Yaoguai beat on me for 10 minutes while waiting for a teammate to head over and hit it. It is so dumb.
---
After level 45 they don't do nothing to me
---
Just scrolled through 20ish posts, only one I saw on the topic was this one.
---
So with that in mind... is this game worth coming back to? I haven't played since yesterday, what's changed?
---
Same as me
---
Broken camera can be found as rare loot in toolboxes now, at least.
---
Yeah but that also controls every other effect including the gunshots which are loud to begin with, so holotapes still get drowned out. They need to be isolated
---
Yep
---
That might be able to help, but idk.
---
As nice as that time is me and my group wait till there about 3 mins left then actually do the pylons and kill it. Always trying to get the wxtra legendary star spawns and that extra junk is always nice.
---
There are a couple videos on YouTube which show you how to build a bit more of a rounded camp, could make a very nice arena with their help
---
Yeah the price for serums is kinda crazy! I saw a guy selling them for 100c and a few selling for 1k up to the base 3200 value
---
2 caps each at my store
---
Check toolboxes, as they're now rare loot in them. Otherwise you can try checking tourist attractions around the map.
---
I'm on PS4 as well and have some plans and interested in getting more plans that I don't know. :)
---
I'm on PC and I'm looking for it also...
---
To throw the pvp'rs a bone, they WANT players to hunt other players. I just don't know why in the current fuckery that is the current meta.
---
And if you turn on subtitling, the text is very small and hard to see against most backgrounds...as previously noted, have to look at the sky or a 'distraction free' background to read it....and why doesn't it show up while Pip-Boy is open?
---
No, your veiled hint that I shoot and hide in an SBQ fight is invalidated.
---
I've never seen a legendary scorchbeast outside of the queen
---
I just sell mine at 299 because it's a price most can afford.  Then if they don't sell, I can always make more of a profit off a couple by selling them to the NPC vendors.
---
Did you notice if the lead mod is like the added capacity in that you learn it automatically just by having it without reading it?
---
Exactly
---
Its nice too my group loves to find that extra bleed time mag and uae that as well.
---
Yes but you're missing the fact that RT was a dictator-like god entity ruling over the poor workers in the cave. We'd need a true god to rule over the builders.
---
There is a proximity for loot but it is way too close. As a melee build I am often killing things my sneaky ranged friends cant loot because it died too far away and I blocked their shots. Hardly seems fair. It cost them a bullet and cost me nothing yet I get the reward.
---
for me it's been: 
---
* hulking megasloths scattered around the fissure sites to the south 
---
* gulpers in the cranberry forests 
---
* snallygasters in the trainyard 
---
* giant ants around bootlegger's shack
---
Might be because of Fireproof, have not heard anything about nerfing them
---
Freaked me out when I first saw this lol
---
Dense mod on the torso for sure, it has saved my bacon countless times.  I personally run a bloodied melee build and I find that the damage boost from being low hp is enough to warrant running a full set of bolstering/cavalier/+strength set.  I mod my limbs with ultralight for so boost.
---
Can we also get subtitles or larger font for the notes we pick up?
---
I end up not being able to read have of them because of it.
---
Not visually impaired but I second this!
---
Also, tone down the PA spotlight, it washes out everything that you're facing!
---
Yep. I made and sold a couple non legendary handmades
---
Yeah only because Watch Dogs made it boring. God, was that a dissapointment. 
---
Just think of the fallout that would happen if one of the highest crime rate cities in the US had to deal with the aftermath. And the skyscrapers would be awesome to see after the destruction. Kinda how they did Fallout 4 but bigger I guess.
---
Same.  It makes it so frustrating that it limits my desire to visit camps unless they have a lot of weapons or armor up for sale
---
PANDER
---
SHOUT the Loudest
---
Vocal MINORITY
---
Unfortunately...
---
"I dont care either way"
---
I mean, from an accessibility point of view this should be included in settings so people can adjust everything to suit their needs 
---
Hopefully try implement customisable setting in the future! :)
---
Do you have a shrubbery?
---
I never learned how to play caravan so i guess I'll have to stick to bum fights
---
Turn down everything except the holotape, then turn up your tv. The holotapes will be louder and everything else the same as before.
---
This has been happening to me only if I load items into my vending machine before I log out at my camp. 
---
One way I got around the freezing was to quickly fast travel away from my Camp before it loads in.
---
I’m sure there are other situations where the game freezes, but this is the only one I’ve experienced consistently since the latest patch.
---
To take a picture naked in nuke zone, wear a hazard suit. It counts, ezpz
---
I keep all of my one stars at 100-250, unless it's a really great prefix like ts, aa or bloodied. Then I will price it at 500 caps. That's less than half of what a vendor run is daily and a one star, level 50 weapon with the right prefix for your build can get you far in this game.
---
JOHN, where is my lasagna, JOHN!
---
Well there are data mines of mailbox skins in the shop
---
agreed on the PA spotlight, it went from barely visible to jesus lights, isn't there a middle ground?
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Only 200 caps!
---
If you crafted the backpack then you are a Possum.
---
Great find buddy
---
Not anymore than it already is.
---
Same thing happened to me. They told me they couldn't do anything about it
---
Armor weight has an effect on stealth. But there are much more important effects to think about, and perks &gt; armor.
---
There are a couple critical thresholds to take note of, 50, 100, and 250
---
If your armor is in excess of these values it gives significant advantage over having it below them. 
---
50 represents having enough armor to impact semi and fully automatic weapons used by enemies, as well as fast melee like knives. 
---
100 is the approximate threshold to negate slower fire attacks, like high level hunting rifles, sledgehammers, and most spit attacks.
---
250 is the amount needed to really deal with the heavier hitters, things like deathclaws, fog crawlers, and scorchbeasts.
---
Aim for these thresholds at a minimum and you will get about as much resistance as you need, relatively.
---
Even basic power armor get to 300 armor rather easily, which will take most of the fight out of most enemies, and going beyond this doesn't yield as much gain compared to before this point.
---
The real question as far as normal armor goes is whether you can get decent armor with decent legendary effects, as getting flat damage reduction % is stronger than getting marginal increases in armor value.
---
going from 150 to 200 armor isn't particularly impactful against most enemies, so taking a slight hit to armor values in exchange for better effects is worthwhile. As long as you don't drop below those general thresholds.
---
Do you have the brick building set or any of the resort items?
---
Yeah it was probably that.
---
I just want a flat roof piece that has the white border on the edge of it for the red barn walls, is that too much to ask?
---
Like a gernade? I like it
---
Yup visit my shop I have like 30 for sale for all
---
Under 100 caps 
---
Or claim and defend workshops, those always give camp plans
---
where did he complain?
---
I prefer people visiting my camp cuz I spent a lot of time on it and it's in an odd location in the Mire that not as many would stumble across
---
yeah fallout has always had its jokes but a lot of cartoony shit has come out lately
---
I think that'll come with the new terminals.
---
Reminds me of the Sophie Ellis Bextor video for Get Over You - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r72Sbmj2OrM
---
Its easier to melee the ones on the ground, where any intervening dead bodies don't block the attack.
---
If not made viewable in game via framed photos or something at C.A.M.P., then they should really just copy what Bungie did in Halo 3:
---
Every person's profile had 6 pictures that could be pinned for viewing whenever their in-game profile was selected. The pictures are downloadable, so the ones they have pinned might not be their own but rather ones they liked or found funny, and the most downloaded/shared pictures were rotated weekly/monthly for everyone to view each week on their website or something.
---
shoot you know I forgot to pay attention. Ah but when I went into my inventory the plans did not say (known). I'm pretty sure. I'll have to check.
---
That's why i asked. You finally said it's junk containers.thx
---
Good point, idk why they couldn't put in human npcs, thinking about it when people glitches into the second room a while back, there was a human NPR in it.
---
he didn't complain about anything, he is skeptical of your fake method
---
obviously you cant reproduce it, graham just happened to be walking by when you finished your 2nd defense, you just got lucky being in the right place at the right time
---
Miami is basically going to be a tropical vacation dlc... I'm looking forward to it
---
I already am. I have 4 vending machines pull of nothing but uncommon plans. The problem is all my rarer plans sold, and the rest just seem to be gathering dust.
---
So many of the plans I had planned on selling for 100-200 caps are not even worth the stash space now. It's to the point I think I'm going to dump them all at flatwoods, and start over as a mutation vendor.
---
I've seen camps there so it is Campable.
---
This is a great example of the sorts of ridiculous suggestions you get when the poster wants to have their cake and eat it too.  If you want experience, participate in the fight.  If you want to share exp and your asshole teammate keeps one-shotting enemies, tell them to switch to a less OP weapon.  Otherwise, I'd be pretty lame for higher-levels to power level some newbies while they do literally nothing but stand there.  This isn't a QoL suggestion for players.  This is a QoL suggestion for miles and people who don't want to play the game, just like the tools near release who were whining about fact travel costs.
---
Mods for 76?
---
I can't read half of the notes.
---
Sounds like you blew it. You need to manufacture a new access card or whatever, will cost you about 2k caps.
---
By buying atoms and not doing the challenge... or at least that's what it seems they are doing.. making them near impossible
---
Tie pre fab bunker structures to Free States quests that’ll be cool
---
This is the biggest reason I don't play with a friend. I tend to do high power low ROF builds, and I have to deliberately not shoot anything before he does.
---
huh
---
Yes, there are some client side mods.
---
The only thing I could see/ like to see is if we can add them as frames to our camp. We have all the paintings and photos we can add already, would be cool to use the edit with one of ours
---
Not that its impossible to do that... just a pain in the ass.. not a challenge
---
LOL
---
Just did it for twentieth time, still no badges
---
It is
---
I’ve been getting a bug recently where I can’t remove certain items (usually walls) but can remove everything around them leaving them floating, when I encountered this bug I was able to build onto the floating pieces (I didn’t really experiment much because I just wanted the floating walls gone), maybe this dude has found a way to exploit that and build a ‘floating’ base?
---
i got a buddy on board to play and going to go through all the starting quests with him.  it should be a nice refresher. 
---
i was just lost and getting raped in a higher lvl area. didnt know how to go about the situation i was in was getting frustrated lol.  
---
have a sense of direction now.
---
Just kill them if they shot back
---
One of today's atom challenges required being nude in nuke zone
---
Ah thanks. This is madness. The game explained it really bad and it's not in line with the rest of the game.
---
Oh nice! Good to know!
---
who cares?  I guess you do.
---
My wife lost all of hers as well, super sorry to hear that.  Sucks since you can't recreate some of them if they were from Fasnatch.
---
That's a terrible argument. It's like saying that crimes happen anyhow so why bother with laws and courts. It's exactly this friction you have an issue with that makes it less rampant.
---
Could they improve on it? Sure. However, if someone kills something before you do, seems fair that they get the XP. 
---
Maybe we should look at why killing even high level creatures can be near instantaneous with some weapons and builds. Look into balancing weapons and builds so there's enough time for people to contribute to a kill without feeling bad for the players involved like it's a mega bullet sponge.
---
I say let them sell their 1 star for 6000 caps. I'll just keep undercutting them with my 600 cap goods.
---
Did you read the body of the post? Seems it's not that impossible thank god
---
Exactly. I guess I was just wondering if people knew of a (possibly) repeatable glitch that allows this to happen. It doesn’t sound like a very reliable glitch though.
---
Yeah i do to, i only did this run twice. From 0 - 47 i took almost 1 month.
---
team members can only add stuff to your camp, not remove or move stuff around
---
Yes! This happens to me in VATS. If I'm not in VATS they are invisible. It happened with 2 scorched.
---
The cave where you start the Enclave quest has two nests, one either side of the entrance  (not sure if there are more outside) and two inside the cave itself.
---
I have found a deathclaw hide in a deathclaw nest before - although this was a random encounter nest, one of those deathclaw vs supermutant ones - so I'm assuming all deathclaw nests can have them.
---
There is also a nest in Hopewell Cave but this spot looks much better for this purpose.
---
That sucks, I have only done it 4 or 5 times with no badges.  Someone had mentioned the chance was like 25% so maybe RNG is just hitting you hard.
---
Personally some of the Possum challenges don't seem that bad so I will just be doing both.  Campfire at night, tedious tasks at day.
---
I already am for a lot of them. I might just drop all the prices to the bottom and clearance out my entire inventory of plans.
---
I have the engineer outfit. Does the back pack show over the tank or does the tank show?
---
i know i'll ask a lot, but do you have a map with the route ?
---
In fact I'm going around amd buying 1 star legendaries so I can trade them for scrip. Nothing over 50 caps for weapons and maybe 40 for armor. Like OP mentioned, there are a lot of people who are trying their luck with ridiculous 1000+ caps prices... vast majority are low level players that probably don't know any better though.
---
Being hard is not a bug nontheless.  Watoga as many spawns for them.
---
I'm sorry you dont care to explore, especially in an exploration game. That doesnt dismiss the fact that more was added and its lovely and fun to explore and see. Exploring every corner to see what was new was exciting and it is unfortunate that you seem to be deadened to that wonder.
---
The Rust Devils from the Automatron dlc. 
---
You couldn't join them which I thought was always kinda sad. Did a sort of splinter faction of them though in one of my settlements for my Raider playthrough.
---
I have two trap builds, one has fours flamethrowers behind a wall that when you lay in a bed a trip wire locks you in the room (1x1) and a pressure plate turns on the traps, it’s very hard to kill people with the four traps only. My other build has 8 radiation emitters and 12 flamethrowers in a 1x3 between two powered gates (trip wires to close the doors and trigger the traps), it kills people almost instantly :)
---
Only happened once but yes quite annoying
---
Ok. Cool. I’ll check it out. I might have encountered a hide drop before. But since they are not consistent I probably forgot.
---
hazmat = naked, PA = naked
---
This... its like the explosive makes the gun do 90% less damage.  Surly must be a bug.
---
Adrenaline maybe had kicked in
---
IIFFFF I RECALL...
---
Someone posted a screenshot of the Photo Gallery all bugged out and one of the buttons that appeared was "Post to Twitter" kind of like how WoW does it, I know it's not much, but that would be better than nothin', I'll try and find the screenshot of it.
---
Can confirm this. I am a lowly tadpole, yet that event has given me 1 possum badge. :)
---
Sometimes added content like this, the scout vendor machines, the door to enter the Nukashine, and when it was active, a lot of the Fasnacht decorations, will just fail to load in. It’s normal for them to take a few minutes but sometimes no amount of waiting will help. 
---
Usually server hopping will take care of it but it may take a couple minutes after loading back in for them to pop into existence.
---
I... I didn't even know radiaton traps existed!
---
it's the encryptid event, people do it all the time so you can wait for a notification to appear that the event is starting and tag along if you don't wanna lose the caps
---
lol yea.. i realized when i got back on i domt have the stimpack recipe.  i was just buyimg them before but the caps go fast because i was fast traveling alot. 
---
what i really need. is radaway.   i guess im just gonna have to stop beimg antisocial and ask people for a lil help
---
Good to know for the future with that hazmat suit (challenges sometimes repeats), but it's perfectly doable normal way - yesterday I went with my friend near blast zone, full health, both ate 1 rad shield and went inside the zone completely naked. We took photos of each other and exit with more than 1/2 of health left.
---
I know this but they are...  broken now.  They waaaay less damage.  Like less than just a standard shotgun should do.
---
Drink Ballistic Bock while using it.
---
Um...you aren't on PS4 by any chance are you?
---
They should have included the "Bulldoze" feature from FO4 where you can just scrap highlighted items and turn them into materials like wood, concrete, rubber, etc.  I'm sure its still in the game files somewhere all they need to do is turn it back on.  That would be incredibly helpful when placing CAMPs.
---
I don’t. I’ve got 2 kids. I play for around an hour every night. Usually enough to level up once every session.
---
It’s mastered the ability to stand so still it’s invisible.
---
You don't need to be possum rank. I did the event yesterday as a lowly tadpole and still got a possum badge.
---
I use the news that are useful to me and put the other in my vending machine for 100 caps. They usually sell fairly quick.
---
Think is... its not even doing 100% damage yet alone 150% damage.  IT feels like its negative damage modifier.
---
Feels like it was broken more than nerfed.
---
The bug is that you can only get them from world spawns.  Watoga has 7 spawn points with a less then 1% chance and they aren't instanced.  The math is pretty simple in that the magazine part is just about impossible the way things spawn right now.
---
I'd agree.  I'd say the only caveat to that is if you run the Scorchbeast Queen as Bloodied, you may opt for something like Lead Lined instead, because you'll need to get your Rad Resist up to about 100 in order to cancel out her constant Rads, which in turn deplete Dodgy and prevent you from Power Attacking.
---
You want recoil? I've got a full auto railway rifle you need to meet
---
Go to Fort Defiance and collect surgical trays.  They are aluminum and scattered all over.
---
It just sucks, I didn’t think I would be so attached but I’m really gonna miss seeing them. I messaged support back suggesting that they change the way the photos are saved, I doubt they’ll do anything buuuttt it’s worth a shot.
---
It's a single room. A very small one with one lore note. Expansive content.
---
I went through all of it. VERY little has changed. The feel is very different, that I already said. In terms of actual content, it's mostly blocked passages to rooms that already existed. Storage cupboard moved. An added security door to force you into the only piece of actual new content. 
---
Tell me. What of substance has changed?
---
I was on a team, but was alone in the high school
---
It’s a Grahm only plan. I sell them on PS4 if you need one :) 
---
I used to lock a bloatfly somewhere in my camp so people couldn’t fast travel out but with this new patch you can now fast travel even if an enemy is near by, so using a Radiation emitter can do enough damage to stop them from fast travelling :)
---
Theres 10 machine gun turrets firing at you and a very angry person running at you in Death Rider power armor if you do it at my camp lol
---
itsGRAVE, add me and I'll give you one when I'm online
---
I was a tadpole and I was getting possum badges lol
---
I'm hoping for a level 5,  3-star rolling pin.
---
Create coding for when this happens and it really messed with their gear. I would enjoy dupers suffering with this issue until they drop their goods. If they grab any of it afterwards, then it would be far worst.
---
I still remember hearing other players killing dupers and stealing their stuff. They would server hop and drop it in water before server hopping again. This makes me proud of those players everyday for their sacrifices to keep our servers clean.
---
Ok, if by chance it works like that and you learn it just by holding the plans, I would give a 1k caps to "borrow it" and give it back haha. I want the rad resistance,  but the scout quests are just sooo boring to me.
---
If Bethesda could accurately diagnose duped items to do this (which would require them knowing how exactly the duping mechanisms work internally), they could simply patch the method or just insta-ban dupers.
---
👎
---
I know it’s a bit long but I just wanted to clam my ideas more than get views but if you want to see some traps...

Is it higher rank than elder? I've got all the ranks up to elder learned and I thought it's all...
---
Thanks! I think I'm starting to get interested in this kind of thing.
---
I think reaction to offered items should be added to vending machines, like in trade between players. These reactions should be logged and you can read them. Like: Purified water, Noobmaster69 reacted: Items is too expensive! This will help to set right prices and will be more interactive after all
---
I sold my 3star spiked rolling pin for 500,
---
Where did you get the s'mores plans at?
---
It’s a 25% chance to get the Possum badges from the dailies and event It’s not Garuanteed but it’s there
---
It would also place a lot of strain on the servers.
---
And how should they ban all those do you think?
---
Collect them for display.
---
Use the rest until you don't need them.
---
Sell the rest in a vending machine for a few caps.
---
This and notes in game.  Those of us that suffer from diagonal screen impairment agree.  My TV is only a 37".  :(
---
A+ for time and effort, unfortunately for you I can say what ever I’d like, just the same as I can’t stop anyone from showing up to these events.  The intro dialog tell you it cannot be injured without first being made vulnerable.  Other than that everything else you said was purely emotional and mostly confirmed most of what I said, just gave excuses to it with a ton of emotional language.
---
Campfire Tales quest
---
So it’s fair, for all reddit users to have OP duped BE lasers or whatever and those who don’t to just manage on what they get. If you like that then you do you
---
would be very nice to look at though
---
Would love to use 2 10mm pistols
---
I ended up making a "Freebies" vending machine for plans like those.  Plans ultimately take up a surprising amount of weight, so if it doesn't move, it goes in the Freebie machine.
---
The pioneer event at camp Adams.
---
Whitesprings Resort vendors
---
I am fairly certain that the only 'creatures' that can 'drop' deathclaw hides are Gulpers and SM Behemoths.
---
I haven’t had that experience personally, I found a BE 50 cal for 5k and multiple pieces of unyielding/sentinel pieces for 2-3k.  Try offering 5k for any BE weapon in the fallout markets/discord chats.
---
I think if you hit select when you have the pip boy out it changes to an easier to read screen.
---
Just North of Harper's Ferry.
---
suggestion only,and others may disagree. There are perk cards that limit or negate rads in food / water. food and water is health and you can cook to make better.
---
flatwoods has a wee quest that teaches you how to craft disease cures
---
perk card to gain more from aid boxes and you can always swap them out when needed
---
 pick up and scrap every weapon you can find,save the ones you are using, that learns you to craft better ones.
---
scrap is EVERYWHERE, get used to finding a workbench and turning your junk to scrap at EVERY oppertunity.
---
personally, don't bother to much about main quest lines, they will always be there waiting. I like to explore.
---
I went from flatwoods up to the bridge and just kept going. didn't put my first camp down until i'de been all the way thru the ash heap and thru the tunnel. (still in the same spot from levl 25)
---
its not that hard if you use a little common sense, and run away from scorchbeast
---
Tbh I’m going to be sooooo happy the first time someone traps me! Haha :) I never take anyone’s bag unless they don’t come back for it but mostly people return and give me a thumbs up haha
---
Nice idee !
---
Just because you decided to ignore temporary buffs doesn't mean the game was incorrectly designed and now needs to be remodified.  From a design perspective, their temporary nature means they have less of an impact to the game as a whole. If for some reason one of them is overpowered - you don't even necessarily need to nerf it, you simply reduce the RNG for it showing up.
---
I went and tried to complete the Metalworker challenge, and god damn...getting that ore was straight up hell.
---
No it’s below elder so it’d be Paladin, Sentinel and Elder.
---
I post any duplicates for 0 caps.  Spread the good.
---
Weighted on Limbs should add an amount of "Armour Penetration" on you Unarmed/ Melee Attacks
---
Custom Fitted for less AP drain on Sprinting (Combined with Marathoner you can run for DAYS\*)

Leadlined is always useful

There’s a video that should help :)
---
Workshops, if you want generator plans take over the power plants. Also the power plants give power to other workshops so work in tandem with that. E.g. Monogah and the munitions factory, or Thunder Mountain and Berkley springs. There are more but these are just some options. The power plants also power substations. 
---
Happy hunting :P
---
Sounds like me then! xD
---
Seriously. I fucking hate duppers.
---
I was practically giving the jet pack plans away.
---
If you run the SBQ with any frequency, you'll have a ton of them.  Must have had 4-6 copies of each.
---
wait did they nerf it so if you over repair it will not increase the damage?
---
Sounds good to me!  Will upvote.
---
Absolutely!
---
The feel as fresh vault dweller entering. Seeing the planning for the attack, how many responders fell prey to disease before learning about it from the overseer, the rushed feeling and the danger they must have experienced as they prepared for a battle. Finding the officer and the note while looking for a way to continue past giving more depth to those that lived there before. The airport didnt carry as much sentimental value and effect as it does with this update. There is a broader sense of organization and the dire situation Appalachia has fallen into. That is content.
---
This may not be a good fit for your expectations, but in a story driven game, more story IS more content.
---
Plasma Corona or something like that, so fun. :)
---
Not only do they not cater to the visually impaired, but they don't give as shit about deaf people. This is why they need a chat system.
---
Hahahah, with KL-E-0's voice? xD
---
Bethesda doesn't care. This complaint has been bwing made since launch. Sorry.
---
Why would it make sense that ballistic weapons break faster? Maintaining guns in the real world is fairly simple. But energy weapons aren't real. We don't know how they work, how fragile they are or how maintaining them is handled. What we do know is how the older games treated them. I think there's a reason that in the Fallout games, only factions with the capability to repair and maintain energy weapons were shown to field them or sell them in large numbers. The Gun runners, the brotherhood and the enclave to name a few. Could you run across raiders or other enemies using energy guns? Sure you could. But unless the faction is technologically advanced enough or has a solid infrastructure they have not been shown to use energy weapons over ballistic weapons.  I could've sworn that there was something about this mentioned in the earlier games, let me check up on that real quick.
---
Mixed bag.
---
For a new character, player vending can be awesome. Cheap plans earlier and more readily available in a lot of cases. Useful as extra fast travel spots, especially to key locations that you may otherwise find it harder or longer to do. This can feel a little exploity though.
---
Without the ability to preview a store before fast travelling really limits shopping for me to places that are nearby. Too much of a waste of craps for what can be a real crap shoot.
---
Also, more often than not adhesive and purified water are no longer an issue in terms of scarcity. I don't know how much impact that'll have with the game but I imagine it messes with balance somewhat.
---
Not to mention that you get Fo3 or NV with all dlcs for that.
---
*...but thats none of my business...*
---
It makes me weep when retail advice comes in the form of ‘be like Walmart’. :(
---
I use ultra-light limbs for the reduced weight and 40 extra AP, with a dense chest mod for explosive protection.
---
Implement server managers easy
---
You aren’t talking about the value that the gun says right
---
Also, I found 4 already in ghouls, randomly around the map.
---
The first was the tourist in the mouintain, in the parking lot of that palace with the hanging gardens. But still, I found 4 more.
---
Maybe it's just because I have a friend's CAMP that always spawns me halfway in the foundation, but I pretty much never fast travel *directly* to CAMPs because of this.
---
Basically, in the past they could have a weapon that was very strong but had the trade off of needing expensive designs. IN the base game that is fine game design. Now it's just a way to introduce pay to win.
---
thanks man, its weird that my Antivirus doesnt notify me about something like this ...
---
Ooohhh... depends what kind of a view you're looking for and in what region. I must have had more than 100 different camp locations now - any criteria for what you'd ideally like? :)
---
Sorry, to clarify... was it a fat clown staring at you through the window? (not sure if you meant to answer me or the guy directly above)
---
In that case I doubt we'll ever have it - when you craft Paladin is BoS V and Elder is BoS VI, so either they'll change it or never use the sentinel (I bet on the second, since BGS is lazy).
---
Im guessing it would scale to ur level. They wouldnt make the levels be random would they?
---
Want to make waaaaay more money than you do selling in game at your vendor station? go to the reddit fo76 m arketplace or fo76 b azaar subs and post your items, say you are "accepting offers" then let people post offers, usually you will get stuff about 100-200 % more than selling in game
---
small stuff like recipes and plans and ammo can be sold at vendors, but those 3 star weapons will go for faaar more here on reddit
---
The map takes a while to populate.
---
If you are server hopping a lot in one spot - as opposed to checking a few spots in the same server before hopping again - it may never populate for you.
---
if it wasn't for dupers, fighting the queen with crafted weapons would still be the norm. 1\* legendaries at best. and few people would know what a tse is.
---
people underestimate the prevalence of duped items in the market.
---
I want something that can make you look on the bright side of the apocalypse. Whether it be landscapes or a good view of structures still in tact
---
Agreed! For example, when ‘crafting’ cooked meat products - simple ‘craft all’ option would make life so much easier!
---
Same. When I join the event I get on area chat and start belching orders. Most people just can't be bothered to read the notes/holo tapes, but if you teach them how to Douglas, they will dance.
---
Are u wanted?
---
You can keep the dense chest, and either run lead lined limbs, or pieces with rad resists. I have +75 rad resists from armor pieces, it makes the extra rads from the queen less noticeable as a bloody build.
---
I am. Is there something you can suggest. Because I don't see why a hard to find item should cost 4 figures unless it's got a legendary effect or two. If it's a common item you find then sell it less but many players won't go for something that they can find but it's a hard common item to find then sell it.
---
It already has the route in the game. Stay on the 65. 
---
I usually skip Harper's unless I have stuff to sell, and go straight across the water from Valley Galleria to Southern Belle, that route also usually starts the Shepard's quest which has a Sheepsquatch spawn.
---
He's like: Here comes the new contents! xD
---
You can buy mods as a tadpole but they will not do anything until you unlock the backpack by becoming a possum scout
---
True it would cost plastic but in that aspect I enjoy the grind of having to go look for more plastic it’s not exactly hard to come by and it gives me something to do and a reason to explore other than just to go do events
---
You're acting as if I didn't want to return the game after like 1-2 hours of playing.

Increase the font on the notes!

Can't stand top 3 markers. Total distraction from actual game play. They should have just made a separate deathmatch / BR mode and then released a proper survival mode.

You forgot to include unpublished content.

Take a picture of legendary player with Purveyor while it's radstorm, while wearing full clown suit and drunk and Grahm trading with Mothman on background, whatever, it's impossible anyway, but FYI nuke zone counts as radstorm - 10 atoms
---
i get it i'm just like... huh.
---
Not me. I don't wear the clown costume. I just found it really funny because I ran up on someones base CAMP that day and they where sleeping in there bed and I had the Camera in my hand. So I thought by some chance it could of been me.

2 shot fully modded combat rifle 1 \* 
---
im sure for alot of you this is a bad weapon lol
---
but its been my main gun for sniping and general use for alot of levels, when adrenaline procs i can 1 shot anything in the burrows, minus the bots
---
for bosses i use a 
---
instigating black powder (bought at WS)
---
2 shot the dragon (bought at WS)
---
then switch the combat rifle and finish him off
---
Nah. 
---
I sell everything according to "character". The things my character isn't interested in... are super cheap. The things he likes... are super expensive. And the things he doesn't want to get rid of... are ridiculously priced.
---
I use my vendors to try and "tell a story" in my camp... .I don't know if it works, but I like to think it does.
---
&gt;or does it have to do with being wanted?
---
yes
---
Wastelands advisor rating: 5/5
---
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
---
If you’re searching for s’mores then this is the place in the wasteland to visit. Quick and polite service, great food, excellent value for caps and conveniently located too. 
---
Would definitely recommend!
---
yeah it would REALLY REALLY suck to get a god tier 3 star only to have it be ruined by only being 30th level. I think I would set my copy of fallout 76 on fire if that happened to me.
---
I really want too do it now stop teasing
---
This is a common thing but some players want to use the vending machines. I mean, that's why we have them and many players new to the game don't know about Reddit or the bazaar.
---
This is why it's a good idea to sell less instead of just sitting on stuff for awhile.
---
I thought you could sell those items to vendor bots. Just your vending machine.
---
Everyone's getting food at the whitespring to dupe items
---
59 comments and most of them “read” it wrong. Maybe they read it right and you are whining...
---
I am yes first time and it was accidental
---
So we basically agree that it feels different. Bravo. I also mentioned the story (lore additions).
---
What other actual new content was there again? I'm sorry, got a little lost in you not answering the question.
---
People don't show up on the map if ur wanted
---
My more precious pics were some random encounters with players and a few perfectly timed shots, I’m considering trying to remake some of the photos I took solely for loading screens but I know they just won’t be the same. It’s really sad to see that this seems to be (semi)common problem.
---
My character makes it easier for others since I don't like to over price items. But I do like to give a helping hand to citizens.
---
PRICES ARE SET BY THE MARKET NOT YOUR DESIRE TO RIP PEOPLE OFF
---
Setting prices to the default would have you ripping yourself off. I'm not charging the default price for my assassins sentinel marine leg. I'm not setting the default price for plans either, I sell them for 1 cap each - you are doing me a favor by taking them. Some relatively rare ones I might sell for a little more, like SMG plans.
---
Can confirm. Did the story event and received a possum badge but still currently trying to finish tadpole badges.
---
I did not know that, thanks!
---
Not so much a cost reduction - but I think that every piece of clothing classified as Underarmor should come with a free Outfit variant that you can wear over armor.
---
I think Power Armor skins are massively overpriced, but I don't use Power Armor much so 🤷‍♂️.
---
Lmao at people who sell serums for anything more than 300, ive seen prices in the thousands. Or thousands for low tier stuff like 1* bloodied
---
I’m hoping it’s just a bugged drop right now but you may be right it’s probably not very high on their priority list with all these dupe glitches creeping back into the game.
---
If I remember correctly, the patch that buffed energy weapon durability did NOT include the Laser Rifle/Pistol for whatever reason, it's literally the only energy weapon that has the original crap durability.  There was a slight uproar in this sub at the time that shouldn't be hard to search for.
---
It hasn't been answered. We'll find out soon. Most speculate that it will be based upon character-level, since any other approach would be a hot mess.
---
My general rule of thumb for all my characters (with the exception of one) is to sell everything at 50% of the in-game vendor pricing.
---
I think people have said radroach but I could be wrong.
---
Nylon*
---
Wait wait wait wait wait. Your defending dupers?
---
the white wolf fedora counts for me at least im farming supermutants to get some skeletons i found like 9 xd
---
3real
---
It seems it's been taking much longer to load the server/maps in than it used to. Like 5 -10 minutes more than it used to pre hot fix last week.
---
The character pips on the maps are the last things to show in the load order, so you may have actually been in a populated server?
---
Ok thank you I will wait for some confirm
---
And drunk
---
If i want to sell dirty water for 1000 caps each I can !
---
From my experience yes, I have a Hunter's SS death Tambo that does more damage to it than my AA deathclaw gauntlet so from that I would definitely say it counts
---
I'll simplify it for you, in a story driven game more story is more content. 
---
Trolling to put something nice down doesnt change that.
---
 Content is something added to the game. You keep trying to say 'expansive' which was never mentioned. Something was added to the game. That was actual new content.
---
I can one shot everything except the larger, tankier enemies but I get one shorted by lvl 10 super mutants lol.
---
I mean if you've done \*any\* research at all on one of these places you will have an idea of what things are worth and it has virtually nothing to do with the default prices in the game.
---
It's hilarious. I've even seen some people state that the going rate for serums is 700+.
---
If people want to pay those prices, more power to them. They're just way over paying.
---
Yes! I am visually impaired/blind and I always have to ask friends to help me with quest or finding items as I can't see them! Changing the colour of the "diamond" to help wyou find items would be awesome something bold like bright purple would be so much easier for me or other people please upvote this so they can change it for disabled people!!!
---
Caravan was so breakable. Fill your with 6s, 8s, 9s, and 10s, with Kings added. When you have enough cards, cut it down to only 6s, 10s and kings, or only 8s, 9s and kings.
---
It's how I made all my money in NV.
---
I'm simply stating a fact.
---
Still trying to find the camera haha
---
Bruh
---
I just hide in a dark corner
---
Is that bug still going? Didn't they fix it?
---
I personally think it's cool if level based say 1-10, 11-20, 21-30 and so on.
---
Well, if nothing else, it's useful for weight reduction I guess.
---
Rank 3 Martial Artist + Swing Speed Combat Knife is a ridiculous thing to watch because you stab almost 1:1 with mashing the button.
---
Have you checked the market place recently
---
No, I mean I was wearing the clown costume.
---
You are aware that it's been over six months and that 'investigation' hasn't had a single update, or any signs from the firm they have anything they can so much as put forward?
---
I would sell them for around 150.
---
The white fedora you get from the imposter does work for the challenge.
---
Those hand written notes can blow sand!
---
😭😂
---
Right click while in the Pip Boy menu and it makes it full screen with a black background.
---
you can do some trickery with door frames, will explain later i'm at work can't talk lol
---
No he was naked
---
This. It's not that simple. If it were, we wouldn't have bugs or exploits that allow for duping.
---
Dont look down when you shoot a fatman
---
thanks ! =)
---
How so? I have quick key "C" on steam and literally all and every game on steam takes screenshot which is saved into own folder on my computer, which I can then do whatever I want with it, for example share it on my steam profile screenshot showcase.
---
But that doesn't mean the glitch couldn't been fixed.
---
I have recently been doing a heavy character, (Heavy Gunner Perk- 2 full cards and 1 - 2*ed; Stabilizer Perk at full) and I am surprised how a regular mini-gun will chew up a SB, I would like to find a good Legendary Mini to see how much more faster it will go thru them.
---
I would love this to be added in at some point. The pre-written messages are a definite must. Allows a range of expression while preventing anyone from being rude (also makes it easy for console-players who may not have a keyboard).
---
Yup.  Over repairing no longer increases melee damage or defensive stats on both weapons and armor.  Swear they just made the best way to repair worse to make their worst way to repair look better.  Maxes out at 4 damage now.  So now its literally just a toy and 13 lbs of worthless in battle.
---
Pretty sure its only the 5 insects from the quest, so youd only be missing radroach
---
Ah. Damn.
---
Ok thank you I was suspecting it was like that but I wasn't sure
---
classic
---
Yes. It was in the patch notes
---
Ban the speaifiic word with a filter, you fool
---
That was really easy for me. I just stalked a level 5 for 20 minutes, until he went to the prison up north, and died to the mutants, and I revived him. Then proceed to steal all his kills
---
But now that I think throughly, I got the firefly one and it isn't in the quest
---
Makes it easier to put bags of poop in peoples bases.
---
I've never read that about any end game event anywhere. Do you have a source?
---
None of those locations worked for me.
---
I think bethesda said that you may choose a specific, but its attributes will be random.
---
we'll soon find out. Not holding my breath.
---
Thanks! After your post I saw the cryptid event pop up and killed the imposter! Also I was the conduit for a while too. Cheers!
---
I'm getting a feeling I'm not the first person to make a post like this.
---
Wow and i remember people were selling bloodied My Handys for thousands of caps. I guess no real reason to have mine anymore when my bloodied 10mm can do the job faster.
---
I just use a 1\* Bloodied Power Fist too and it's perfectly capable, even despite being Lv. 40.
---
I have a Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet too, but while it's very good, I'm not sure MMGs have any natural armor penetration capabilities, whereas Power Fists have the Puncturing mod.
---
It reminds me of the lovely soundbite from BioShock;
---
&gt;WELCOME to the CIRCUS of VALUE *!*
---
Since I have had numerous back lash with this post, I'm going to delete now.
---
It's pretty obvious. Some things don't really need proof.
---
Nobody had proof that the RNG was weighted so that the better gear/perks were less likely to drop.......but it was pretty obvious......and then in the most recent patch notes Bethesda admitted that the RNG was weighted when they stated that they would be adjusting the drop rate of the Cryolator and the Gatling.
---
Pretty sure your only missing the radroach. Are all the head mounts in the game now?
---
I have been thinking of getting this mod, how much rad resist does it add?
---
please this too!  the game isn't very mindful for those that have vision or hearing issues (just to skin the surface) but little things could easily be adjusted to help everyone.
---
Actually lasers really do exists and they don't have any friction and the parts used are made to handle the light passing through without melting. They need replacement parts once every 3 years or so on average.
---
"noob friend" and you're L26 asking if more carry weight is worth it... IDK, maybe you're the noob!! ;)
---
There are subtitles, it's enough already.
---
If EU had such a law forbidding any online games that don't support text chat, half of the games wouldn't be released then. 
---
IIRC, when the new Spyro trilogy was released there it didn't have any subtitles at first and it was fine.
---
yes!!!
---
I'm excited
---
Can confirm mounted radroach
---
Not that I’ve seen at all
---
Nah I have a lvl 98 just needed something fresh after a long break and I’ve never really had a trouble with carry weight so I was just curious how significant the difference was
---
this here - accessibility is lackluster but really wouldn't take much to adjust got ALL people to enjoy the game.
---
I don't think they added some mounted insects
---
Pretty sure Bethesda fucked them up and so you can somehow craft them without actually reading the plan. I’ve seen a lot of posts on the market subs about wanting to hold the plan so they can craft the mod, then return said plan.
---
Ok thank you I miss it for sure then
---
He gets it.
---
Psn is brm138
---
They could probably bring it in as a friendly game, but you would not be able to bet in the game, that would cause all sorts of problems with the ESRB (not sure how it would impact PEGI).  
---
I don't disagree that some in game minigames (Caravan or another) would be nice though.
---
I had this happen just last night! I'd seen it happen to maybe one Ghoul in a horde before, but last night it was a whole gang of greased up ghoulies sliding after me!
---
Alright I’m looking for the scorchbeast, yoh gui, and deathclaw heads but I don’t think they’re out yet
---
I want to have faith that Bethesda wants all their customers to enjoy basic functionality in their game without having to use mods.
---
I mean, future game purchases are likely not happening from me personally. I may love fallout but I'm on the fence hard about anything coming later...
---
I made all my money by maxing out luck and getting kicked out of every casino, then stealing all the gold bars from dead money :D
---
My friend also did this and realised what he did and began screaming.
---
The gratuitous DE nerf did NOT help...
---
Overall, I love it. 
---
I get a sense of “I wonder what this guy has” and I get to see a lot more camps. Even though my camp is unlocked and open, I’m more apprehensive about approaching other folks’ camps. With vending, it’s an invitation and I can appreciate designs and walk around. 
---
Practically, I’ve been able to find great deals on things I can use, especially for crafting. I’ve picked up plans that I’m missing at reasonable prices. I’ve used other camps to FT. 
---
Selling has been great as well. I’ve been able to move a lot of stale inventory with player vending and legendary scrapping. That frees us space for me to hold onto the extra junk that I’ve bought for crafting. It’s also nice to see three folks shuffling around to get to each machine. It’s refreshing to see something a bunch of items sell as I go about my business. 
---
Yes, the spawning and inspecting issues are annoying, but it has been a big net positive for me. A transaction log would be really nice.
---
Think for yourself. Don't just follow other people's opinions like sheep.
---
Those plans are bugged. Anyone else you let hold the plans can learn them without consuming the plan item. 
---
People will steal it, so be careful who you pass it along to.
---
Haha.
---
I just tried using the battered fedora to get bones. And its not counting.
---
I don't really care if they do sell them for more. I just kinda want them gone and if there is a chance some young player finds them then the better I guess.
---
Perhaps they meant 'unarmored'....?
---
Awesome. Good to know. I bashed a few things to death with the syringer for that other challenge
---
Thats pretty good. A pink in that short time is pretty damn good. Dont rly know after the Patch but when i used to farm the Fort i always found atleast a Green/Blue/Brown daily. 
---
Maybe the drop chance did increase, maybe not many people farm it anymore. If u manage to get Forest Green/Yellow/Red in the next days then it definitly increased :D
---
I found mines after 3x server hops @ the Big Tea place on the benches in front of the building
---
The fact this isn’t an option still baffles me. Fallout 101.
---
You griefer  scum. Stand by for a doxxing!!!
---
it's very exclusionary and isn't nice... but I still can't imagine a game not offering *basic functionality* for all consumers. any future purchases will probably not be top of my list - unless of course they want to actually listen to their customers and make it accessible for all.
---
XB1 - I sell my weapon and armor plans for near half and camp plans for 25-100. No reason to screw players over. I did notice a lvl2 "player" by up some items so those will most likely be over priced somewhere else.
---
Stabilized arms completely eliminate scope sway, which is nice for stealth sniping.
---
Yao guai is in the game, the other ones not yet
---
Looks like Jack the Ripper from AC Syndicate
---
you're probably the only person in this sub that would get angry at cute little critters populating your camp on their own accord
---
I only get super mutants
---
If you're on ps4 this might help.
---
[How to enable zoom](https://youtu.be/JFhjsITKo-0)
---
Alright thanks wasn’t sure since the last update
---
Dont feed the Yao Guai!
---
Where’s the right click on ps4
---
That pharma farma has a seperate key press to use it when searching med containers.
---
You beautiful human shaped animal!
---
Thanks again!
---
Found one of the easiest ways is make your way to the Mr. Gutsy that's near the shopping mall in the swamp, he'll give you a mission to find someone near a power pylon who has a level scaled hazmat suit, after you get the suit, try to start mass producing molotovs and follow high levels when WS has been nuked.  You get loot, levels, legendaries and Loot.
---
He had in storage, so he took the extra claw off to save weight.
---
That was against computers. I'm sure theres a counter strategy.
---
Are you still meant to be able to destroy them in survival mode? I thought it changed when player vending began?
---
I could be wrong of course.
---
Since I am a casual player. I’ve decided to make anything and everything I sell 69 caps.
---
Is the dog helmet rare?
---
Is it marked on the map like a nuclear bomb? I have seen the event but never seen it marked on the map.
---
Wheres that quest start?
---
because it reflects the changes made to adventure.
---
I mean, it's obvious at this point they're going back on the original idea for Fo76. the "tense" gameplay. so at least do both adventure and survival servers right, don't half-ass it.
---
Didn't shoot it, though I wanted to. :(
---
I got 5 glowing deatclaws that spawn every time
---
*spoiled meat
---
It’d be awesome if while reading them we could press a button and go to computer text, cause I wanna read this stuff but can’t lol
---
Are you sure it’s not your real cat on an alt account?
---
Well... the character is a hunter/trapper that makes his money by rebuilding rifles and making leather goods... so the radstag are fine... but unless those Tabbys are gonna have valuable hides (this *IS* Appalachia, and cat skin makes the best Banjo heads, after all) they're a nuisance. All they do is make me think I'm about to be attacked, since I constantly have a red dot on my HUD, and when I try and hide, I'm always in "danger".
---
It was a recent update to deter Greifing
---
Hmmmm... not sure about the bright side, but for views of structures:
---
1. Start at Gorge Junkyard and head North West towards the observation tower. You'll come across a couple of ledges, one of which has harvestable copper and steel nodes and a cliff view all the way down into the valley below. You can see Top of the World in the distance and the junkyard below.
---
2. Grafton Steel Mill: From the highway beside Grafton Steel, look for a power pylon raised up on a ledge above the road. Follow the power lines back up towards another pylon higher up the cliff. Big, flat build area at the base of the pylon and a view over the steel mill and down towards the reservoir.
---
3. Harper's Ferry Dam: Build right on top of the concrete dam just outside Harper's Ferry. Placing the C.A.M.P. here allows you to build a small, raised base on the pillars and also right down to the water below if you want to put a few water purifiers there. The view across the reservoir is of Harper's Ferry and the rail bridge, which can actually be really lovely in the Mire's odd light. This one comes with an advisory - Rad Toads, Mega Sloths, Hermit Crabs, Super Mutants and the occasional Scorch Beast will take an interest in your camp.
---
4. Site Bravo: Just slightly to the North and East of Site Bravo there are a series of ledges on incredibly high cliffs. You're probably better approaching from the local train station - Sunnytop, I think! The ledges here are huge and oddly free of rocks, trees and things like that. A base here looks down into the forest and pretty much as far across the map as your draw distance allows! This is where I have my current camp :)
---
Hope some of these were of use! If you have any level specific requirements, I'd be happy to give another couple of suggestions :)
---
The gulpers drop them, but it is a rare drop, i have probably killed around 30 or more and have only gotten 1, you can go to gulper lagoon and server hop it would be easier.
---
They only changed it in adventure
---
"BETHESDA OUT OF IDEAS. NOW STEALING FROM NEW VEGAS IN DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO REVIVE THEIR DEAD GAME???"
---
I can see the YouTube titles already.
---
Thats fucking stupid, its pvp mode...
---
I seen things at the Bethesda Vendors for 0 caps before and when I went to get it, an error popped up stating it could not complete the trade and booted me out to the main screen.
---
You, uh, might be in the wrong place if you're looking for raider/survival sympathizers.
---
That being said, they need to remove the restrictions they've placed in survival to take it back to the free for all.
---
Yeah, it relies on a deck heavy in Jacks and Jokers... problem with that strategy is that  is leaves your own deck weak in cards that get you to a winning hand.
---
Awesome, I didn’t imagine my public gripe session would be of benefit to anyone, but I’m stoked that it was.
---
You didn't play Falout 4, did you? ;)
---
I was selling at 1 cap a pop earlier. Was sold out pretty quick tho
---
A roll of toilet paper and a couple raw fertilizer lol
---
Luck will improve the durability bar of looted weapons.  I have a 16 luck and most of what I pick up is already over-repaired.  I still seem to get the same level of end rewards even if I'm at full health or getting +6 from a couple unyielding pieces.
---
When you get the recipe and craft them don’t sell them in your vendor for 150, you can get 500-600 by selling them to a venderbot with hard bargain 3, grape mentats and sweeteoll. Bethesda are also taking 10% vending machine sales tax so just sell them for what you could get at a venderbot dependent of your charisma, perks, food and chem buffs and add 10% sales tax otherwise your just basically just giving them away. Fair play to those that sell them cheap but it’s a useful way to drain the venderbot of their 1400 caps per day and therefore definitely worth more that 150.
---
You can cook cat meat
---
For who?  All the lower-level game content is interesting, but way less fun at higher levels.  You all are suggesting that power-leveling newbies straight past a lot of that content without even really contributing aside from just being there.  It's lame and it makes the game look lame if people can just take a back seat to it and still progress.
---
500 1000
---
not like the blast zone, like an event, on the pylon ambush site. but it notifies you whenever it becomes on
---
Learning new stuff every day from the reddit/fo76 community. TY.
---
I do the same thing. Buy the cheapest one star armor and weapons and turn it in for scrip. I'm almost at the max of 1000 scrip.
---
I have seen1* Legendries go for 6000, 2* - 10000 and 3* - 15000+, non-legendries for 5x the amount (rounded up) and serums for 200
---
brown-chicken-brown-cow!
---
I just want it to have all the daily missions, not just the most recent 3...
---
Dolly sods
---
So...walmart isn't the best example. Walmart is able to sell items for less than their competitors because they do things like keep their costs down for employees, selling products that are made more cheaply, as well as making deals with distributors.  So it's not a fair comparison since there are a lot of factors that don't even matter in FO76
---
As long as your price is more than what you can sell it to a vendor for (otherwise why not just sell to a vendor) and lower than what you can buy it from a vendor for (otherwise people would just by from the vendor) - you'll be fine.
---
A bigger issue is Supply.  If you had 60+ Radaways on you that you decided to sell, you have to consider that most other players have 60+ too, even at the lowest logical price for you, people won't buy it since they don't need it.
---
I pick up 2-3 during the scorch queen event all the time. So not 25k rare. And you cant even wear it or use it for anything.
---
You mean the endless battles at train stations? That was not fun either. If that’s that bethesda wants, they can make a deathmatch arena mode. Survival should be more than that.
---
Not talking about subtitles. Talking about communicating with other players. There is literally zero way for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with other players due to only having voice chat.
---
Also the subtitles are a joke. Half the holotapes have subtitles like "radio drama plays". for any of the mothman stories.
---
You are welcome
---
What platform are you on?
---
&gt;Can't do that without capture software running the entire time. 
---
What are you even talking about? He doesn't have to wait and record 24/7 til he gets lucky and someone buys something, just get a friend to buy something. We know he has the ability to record and upload, and apparently had no problem running capture software to make random videos of picking perks, he just needs to record something that actually proves what he claims is happening is happening.
---
&gt;He already supplied a video. The burden of proof is on you to disprove his video with your own.
---
That's not how burden of proof works. He is the one making the claim that the system is broken.
---
The video he provided doesn't prove anything. If *he* wants to prove *his* claim, he needs to provide a video that shows the relevant details. Even if I do make a video, he can still claim that it happens *to him.* Even if there really is a bug where players aren't getting the right amount of caps, we already know it can't be happening to everybody, or there would be a million posts about it. If it's a bug that only affects certain players, it can only be proved to exist or not exist by the players that it allegedly happens to.
---
I had a vengeful Mothman spawn at the bottom of the first section at Sunnytop. So that was a fun surprise.
---
Yeah it is :/
---
You can make healing salve for when you don't have stimpaks. I can't remember the recipe -- blood leaf and soot flower I think, but you can collect those and look in the cooking station under healing to see what other ingredients, if any.  I think you should be able to make disease cure as well to easily get rid of your diseases. If you have pharma pharma perk in Luck, use that to search aid boxes for healing items.
---
Start taking workshops and do the defend events, also some of the Forest events (like the one at Morgantown airport) will get you stimpaks. Also search for loot up there, there are a lot of aid boxes and other useful loot as well.
---
Workshops will get you camp plans. Most of the events reward you with stimpaks. Now that there is player vending, check some of the vendors (especially near the overseer's camp and Flatwoods). They probably have stimpaks and meds for sale. I sell mine cheap at about 10-15 caps. I sell antibiotics for about 10, etc.
---
Food and purified water will build your health. Anything with HP is good to ingest to raise your health if you don't have stimpaks. Save your stimpaks for your hotkey in combat. When not in combat, eat food and drink water. 
---
Do the wolf hoard event near the fairgrounds in the NW. You can get lots of wolf meat and cook up for lots of ribs. Wood is easy to find for cooking. You can also get low level legendary armor and weapons from this event, which should help you. Sell any that you don't want to keep.
---
Feral ghouls tend to carry Radaway --a lot. Again, Morgantown is good. You can also collect their weapons -- scrap some to learn mods. Sell the rest to the vendor. The train station is right nearby. 
---
Sell everything you can get your hands on to bring in the caps. Invest in the Green Thumb perk in Perception. Pick vegetables with it slotted to get double. Sell the veggies to the vendor. If you go to Billings Homestead or Aaronholt farm, you could end up with 100-200 plants in a short amount of time. That's 100-200 caps. 
---
Bulk any of your excess junk and sell to the vendor. Drink a beer before you sell to get +1 Charisma for better prices. If you come across any grape mentats, sweet rolls, or day tripper, take them before selling or buying from the vendor for even better prices. Also have Hard Bargain perk on if you have it. All of this will help you build up your caps. 
---
Also, walk from place to place instead of paying to fast travel. You'll have an opportunity to build more XP by killing more stuff and you'll save caps.
---
Pick cranberries at Aaronholt farm in the NW and make cranberry cobbler for +5% XP. If you can find gourds and sugar, you can make cranberry relish for +10% XP. This will help you level up faster and get better gear.
---
When your weapons and armor break, just get a new one from another enemy, unless it's a legendary you want to keep. Then grind for the materials. Or you can craft new ones if you have the plans. Always check to see if you can further mod up your weapons and armor. Sometimes you might have gotten a good mod from scrapping.
---
Build in a routine. Most people have certain looting / resource runs that they do. And always start your session by sleeping in a bed until well rested. And play a musical instrument until well tuned. You can find these in the wild if you don't have them in your camp. And most players who have vending in the Forest probably have them.
---
So pretty much like WoW. We mail items to ourselves when our stash was full. Just have to remember to take the items before the mail expires.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Just let us make ammo boxes.
---
I played until Well Tuned at Nukashine and Rusty Pick. No dice. :(
---
Agreed, I have radroach. I think that’s all of them from that quest.
---
I got it last night but if you need it I can help you out. IGN is Zulu38
---
They don't exist in the same capacity and certainly not in the way the games have explained them...
---
But guns work exactly the same.
---
I'm saying that if we're going to change the way the laser rifle behaves we should go by what the games have established so far for the sake of consistency. Let's up the damage and keep the durability low. Or up the damage, keep the durability high and make the repair cost an arm and a leg. Whatever is more consistent with the the way the AER9 is portrayed throughout the series.
---
Yes but you can use the curator perk in Luck to prolong the duration of bobbleheads and magazines too
---
I've never used one.  I just collect them. When I have more than 1, I sell it. Eventually we will be able to display them. Honestly, just looking at them in my stash does not spark joy. We need displays.
---
Thank you. Do you think the quest can drop the bloatfly one too?
---
thanks for the tip, you've definitely helped clear that up for me
---
IIRC, up by Monaghan power plant is a house that starts a Daily quest, wehere you have to syringer animals to understand what they say - IIRC, it gives you makers to chase down a Squirrel.
---
I had that problem. I believe it was related to me having an outdated fallout76custom.ini, updating it seems to have solved the issue for me. Are you on PC?
---
Or a photo album for the coffee tables we need in our CAMPs.
---
no,I did not.
---
Starfox was a flight simulator, is that all it was?
---
It was an issue they said they fixed in an earlier patch but was brought back recently.
---
I think they will use them in new BR
---
"Don't dash through the main questline... wander, take your time... finish the main quest after lvl 50"
---
Damnb i did it like 10 times yesterday and didnt get any.. But shit i will keep trying till i do ! 🚣🎯🔫
---
Im on xbox and the exact same happened to me. Sucks but got plenty photos since.
---
That's, like, just your opinion, man.
---
Whitesprings. Always have them spawn in the little area before the giant parking lot
---
Try by the Whitesprings service entrance and just a little to the north of it past the small parking lot. Usually see rabbits and squirrels there. Near Vault 76 if you head down the path to the east has them.
---
Press the touchpad in the pipboy menu.
---
Lulz
---
Oh so you mean whitesprimgs and the initial game play of FO76?
---
Their is a difference between power levelling someone and wanting to make sure your party members receive their rewards are two different things
---
Even now my level 100-300 friends have the same issue so it effects every one across the board.
---
So yeah I would find it useful? I go as far as having multiple level characters so I can play with my friends. People are going to exploit, find ways to power level etc but does that mean everybody else should get blamed for the same thing I remember when they introduced aoe Looking in World of Warcraft people thought that was going to break the game and it didn't.
---
are you implying that 3* legendaries are only sourced from duping? Because all of my 3* items have come from natural drops as I don’t have anything from the marketplace anymore.
---
Thank you!!
---
It's still there dude lmao
---
Oh you’re so trendyyyyyyyyy.
---
Just sent you a request! 😊
---
I got bloatfly from this quest last night.
---
The spot where you server hop in Charleston for the hunters longcoat helps too. As soon as you spawn in look to left and press vats. Wide array of animals from rabbits, squirrels, frogs , etc.
---
I found out the hard way that the flamer mod for the plasma rifle doesn't count as a flamer to use against robot for this task
---
Oh perfect thank you very much, so I miss radroach and bloatfly
---
Exactly, is PvP, not PvBuildings XD
---
I can confirm that the white wolf fedora does work.
---
Imo it's a gun that shoots fricking lasers so it makes sense it breaks a fair amount.
---
I used the White Wolf Fedora and collected bones at Braxton's Quality Medical Supplies. Worked like a charm for me.
---
I hope it did. I’ve always wanted the red one. I’m going to go back to server hopping like I used to. Thanks for making this post and sharing your experience with it though. I appreciate it
---
This is a genuinely good video which presents the facts about the launch of the game, and is also pretty funny.
---
I wish there was some warning, something that gave people in the top 3 a chance, something you could do other than hole up and wait for the inevitable stealth sniper/beserker to come charging at you so fast that by the time you have any idea they are around you are already dead.
---
Ultimately the problem from my point of view is that people don't render until they are on top of you. You can extend the render range by looking through a sniper scope, but that only works if you already know where to be looking, which means it's not hard for people to start shooting you from a range where you can't even see them unless you look back at them through a high power scope and wait for the game to catch up. 
---
That and the markers update in real time and are always pinpoint accurate to your location. Meaning they don't have to search for you, just look at the map and go. The only way to hide is by going into a building or cave area, which isn't conductive to playing the game as something other than a storm the fort simulator.
---
&gt;It really seems like the big hang up is that these are bobbleheads and in past games bobbleheads were permanent.  If in FO76 they had been presented as anything else they would have been more palatable.
---
Agreed. If it was SPECIAL bubblegum or something, it wouldn't be an issue. But I like my bobbleheads and really don't like the idea of shoving them into my body en masse.
---
I wouldnt be fighting the queen with 1* weapons...that dosent even make sence. Ive farmed some god roll weapons myself. My "queen fighting weapon" is actually a 3* ,Bloodied, 40% power attack, weight reduced super sledge that i found myself......it wrecks shit. 
---
   Maybe i missunderstod you?
---
&gt;What are you even talking about? He doesn't have to wait and record 24/7 til he gets lucky and someone buys something, just get a friend to buy something. We know he has the ability to record and upload, and apparently had no problem running capture software to make random videos of picking perks, he just needs to record something that actually proves what he claims is happening is happening.
---
Most people who play this game play solo, because most people friends quit playing due to the bugs and shitty things bethesda has done. So might not be possible to have just someone buy something from you if you don't have people you play with. Like I play solo because I don't have a microphone, my sennheiser headset doesn't have a microphone and I prefer to use my surround sound with my pc and couldn't use a microphone due to feedback through my sound system. So since they don't have text chat, have zero way to communicate with people to play with.
---
&gt;That's not how burden of proof works. He is the one making the claim that the system is broken. The video he provided doesn't prove anything.
---
He already offered more proof than anyone claiming it isn't happening. So actually the burden of proof is on the people claiming he is wrong. Since he at least offered video of it happening and the dozen other people in this thread also corroborating that it happened to them as well.
---
&gt;Even if there really is a bug where players aren't getting the right amount of caps, we already know it can't be happening to everybody, or there would be a million posts about it. If it's a bug that only affects certain players, it can only be proved to exist or not exist by the players that it allegedly happens to.
---
There are tons of posts about this on "new" the mods are just deleting them. That is the point. Not to mention I had someone claiming "oh I'll take video and prove you wrong" and then he went completely radio silent after he claimed he would take video to prove it isn't happening. Because it is and he can't disprove it with his video.
---
It is insane to act like you have to have video proof of a bug or it isn't a bug. This is literally the only game I've ever seen people make this claim. Which is crazy seeing as how many bugs are in this game to begin with. I'd be more surprised if they released something and it WASN'T full of bugs.
---
Where do you get the plans for lead lined combat limbs?
---
To the west of the Lakeside Cabins in the dry lake bed is a location where pretty much any random animal can spawn.
---
Thanks for letting me know.
---
Congrats mate, I hope you kept all your treasure maps cos now they're worth getting 😄
---
No. That is most definately not what I mean. That got old quickly, and was the main reason I stopped going. There shouldn't be pacifist and camp restrictions in Survival. They need to change the cap penalties back to be more rewarding, but it needs to be more balanced for 50+ level players.
---
There shouldn't be anything indestructable in survival. If you want to keep a base, defend it.
---
of course not. but the odds of rolling a 3\* with **specific mods** are astronomically low, lower than most people here realize.
---
let's put it this way: out of a 1000 listings for a TSE with faster reload weapon, maybe 10 would be real and not duped. probably less.
---
Nice, coming now
---
PC
---
It definitely works on the player vendor stations.
---
wtf, on pc?
---
Hahaha, thank you!! 😄
---
Cool news, will keep an eye out for them!
---
It's not an "official" list if you don't work for Bethesda, just saying.
---
Also tagging users in the body of a text post doesn't do anything. You have to tag them in a comment, and even then, if you tag more that 3 users, none of them get notified.
---
LOUD NOISES
---
Survival mode is a pvp server, there should be no restrictions, people know what they're getting into
---
Where do I find the personal terminal?  I've looked everywhere in my build menu and don't see it.  Do I have to buy the plan for it somewhere?
---
Coming on the 16th.
---
I think they should add duel weapons soon. 1 handed melee and pistols suck. Add in new perk cards for these. I wanna see duel western revolvers. Would be badass and add more viable weapons to farm. 
---
Also add in new mutations and vendors with more expensive loot to buy.
---
Will be after update today
---
A Bethesda fanatic got angry and downvoted because of the title. Lol
---
PC here. But I appreciate the offer.
---
Scrapping, or find someone who can add it. I don't know if lead lined is available via plans for CA.
---
Coming ! !
---
Some mods like scorched killer add an extra star, but there's no natural 4 of 5 star drops yet.
---
"Is Caravan introducing Pay to Win to 76?  New cards available in Atom Shop?"
---
"Bethesda caught Plagiarizing game mechanics developed by another  Company!  New Card game in 76 brings Predatory Card based Microtransactions."
---
"Bethesda out of Ideas?  Possible remaster of New Vegas brings Microtransactions to the Mojave."
---
Yeah just fast travel around player vendors, most are for sale for nice prices.
---
I've completed a fair few:
---
* Archaeologist
---
* Atomics Fan
---
* Backpacker
---
* Electrician
---
* Gardener
---
* Metalworker
---
* Miner
---
* Photographer
---
* Rail Enthusiast
---
You can complete build around level 70 and collect important situational craft perks in 90.
---
LOL yes.  It's crazy.  I think it has something to do with an old server that's constantly having to populate this cell non-stop.
---
Loads of your own posts are questions where people suggest ideas that contribute to you figuring them out. I don’t see what’s wrong with me doing the same.
---
No. They dont exist and Betheada has yet to say that they ever will
---
Of course they did
---
That would be awesome I’d love to see dual wielding
---
Pictures not getting credit towards tadpole challenges case in point for me the mamalogist
---
I'm a little paye to this but regarding the backpack, you have to unlock it via Tadpole challenges. You'll be allowed to craft backpacks at that point. I wanted to mostly note that the atom store backpack is NOT a skin/mod for existing backpacks tho. It made me craft it separately.
---
Yeah, I should caveat my caveat - I meant Lead Lined on the limbs, not the chest.  The chest is the only thing you can apply Dense to.
---
I mean, if you learn the plan by holding it is it any loss to lose it when someone else takes it opposed to destroying the plan on learning it.
---
Super helpful!
---
Underground building would open up so many cool new possibilities and solve alot of problems with unremovable foilage, rocks etc
---
Shhh
---
Thanks a lot!
---
All photos or specific ones? Can you list which ones.
---
So acting like AAE shotguns?
---
Also to add to that, add in shields too. One handed weapon with shield would CHANGE PVP a lot
---
too late :(
---
Ima Coming!!
---
I’ve got a lv 35 3 star baton worth 40. Level doesn’t matter
---
no, you understood me right. what you don't realize is that you're part of a tine minority that beat the real final boss of Fo76: the RNG.
---
ignoring the fact that rolling godly melees is easier than ranged ones, I've played for well over a 1000 hours and have only gotten the ranged equivalent to your 40% power attack, explosive, 3 times. and they were all junk prefixes (zealot's, mutant's and junkie's) and 2 out of the 3 were junk weapons (10mm and 10mm SMG).
---
Yes!! Those seem to be absolutely pointless right now.
---
So speaking of Syringers, one of the hunting ones is to shoot a yao guai with one. I sold my old one awhile back from the quest you are referring to, and the one I can make fires blanks. Do you know if there’s a different type of syringer, or is this one just a pain in the ass? I’m just confused on this one, thanks!
---
That would make things very interesting
---
Spawn at enclave bunker then go up the hill above it there’s a rabbit and squirrel spawn
---
It's clearly not the same.  As it is, the newbie has to get **at least one shot in**.  It can be with anything, even a pipe rifle, but you're kind of already a bad teammate if you don't outfit your newbie with at least a pimped-out hunting rifle for all that early-game .308.  To clarify, that's already a super-lenient and easy-to-understand rule.  They have to at least try.
---
With what you're suggesting, they can just do nothing.  We'll be seeing a lot of boosting teams with a bait newbie, ideally with a Marsupial mutation after level 5.  It's not game-breakingly difficult to power level newbies.  If you just want them to hover around like flies instead of expecting them to be teammates, I guess that's your cup of tea, but that's not mine.
---
Official doesnt mean only that you work for Bethesda. I have gathered the most frequently commented on glitches from all the threads in this forum in the Hope's of helping the community get some attention for the issues in game. But thanks for the downvote. Just trying to help.
---
Yes, she is, but she needs one more day of sleep, after that she needs one day on makeup, after all she is a mole miner :D
---
15 minutes to go, be quick, get Atoms :)
---
Excellent! Thank you.
---
I used to have my camp here. It kinda has a nice view.
---
The silo-thing where the nuke itself is launched out of is very close, so if you're lucky you can see it being launched. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/UP2IVZT
---
lol people don't want to be harassed in-game.
---
Great! Thank you!
---
Np
---
Just a thought - maybe have something similar to Diablo 3 where the XP scales once the player(s) hit max level (50), then shared XP goes to only a fraction of what it was pre-max level. You would still receive the normal XP for kills and quest after reaching level 50, but the amount of shared XP between the one doing the action and the one leeching XP becomes only a fraction of what it was prior to reaching level 50...if that makes sense.  This would help players power leveling alt characters.
---
Yes but I think the damage is higher some how.
---
Real life lasers that melt steel only need replacement parts about once every 3 years or so while guns used in combat need replacement parts multiple times a year....
---
Had trouble with Brahmin particularly the only fix I found was to max out photo list then would get credit , happened with Radstag and you gai as well
---
They really need to remove syringers and drills from the loot pool.
---
Maybe add the bone and sheepsquatch melee weapons to the loot tables while they're at it.
---
Update today ? where did you read that ?
---
Explore. Plenty of named locations that are visually awesome.
---
If they dont want to receive it then theyre not gonna wanna receive one through the game itself lmao
---
It doesn't show up by itself, you have to walk by the camp fire to cause it to trigger, so when night falls, just go to the camp fire and it'll show up and start.
---
It's awesome. I use it as a "Storytelling/Character" device, not as a "make money" device.
---
I can't put out things to decorate my camp, so I use the vendors to paint that picture.
---
They're all there to set the "tone" about my CAMP and my character. All pieced together, with my CAMP build, they're designed to tell a story about who and what this character is. 
---
I price the "first" vendor you see when you enter, just a *BIT* higher than it should be (so nobody is likely to buy anything out of it)... it's strictly there to show "what kind of guy" lives here. The second is priced stupidly low... not saying what's in it, but the prices are upside down... supposed to deepen the profile pic, and pique curiosity. The third is "My stuff", and the prices are set in what I guess would seem haphazard... but they're priced according to "personal value to me".
---
Add in the design of the CAMP, the way it's set up, the flow, etc... and it's all *supposed* to be a little vignette in the wilderness.
---
I don't know if it works... but I sure hope it does. I'd like to think it creates some sort of "ooh neat" reaction in people when they chance across it.
---
So, to me, I love the vendors. I like visiting camps and finding others that are selling "in character". I find it adds so much to the game.
---
No it is a reward for a cold case quest
---
It actually tells you during the quest.. it tells you to put the kindling on the fire.
---
Chainsaws are still super busted. No legendaries, don't drop as loot, locked at level 20, most mods don't work, absurdly low damage. The Buzzblade is the best auto melee and that is just a bummer. Chainsaw is the most fun weapon in the game and you can't even glitch it into being halfway decent now that they fixed the over repair bug
---
Maintinence* either its in the game already and Will be activated after or and update Dyring maintinence. Didnt read it, but thats prob how its goin to be
---
ask dave to leave the server for you xD he is still waiting here
---
nicely done :)
---
I do events for the loot drops, not enemy XP.
---
if someone blasting away with a TSE helps win an event?  I don't give a fuck if I get zero shots in...
---
Just put it in your vending machine for 0 caps. I’ve done that with a few plans after I saw another player had stimpaks and disease cure for 0 caps. I took a disease cure and bought something for caps as a thank you.
---
Yeah, but I manually added this update's .ba2 to the archive and hadn't noticed any other issues so I thought it might be something else, especially after I saw someone else having the same problem. You're probably right though.
---
It's still unofficial. Official as in "authorized or issued authoritatively" or "appointed or authorized to act in a designated capacity."
---
Every post on every subreddit gets at least some downvotes. I didn't downvote yours, I just disagree with your wording. Relax.
---
Yeah i agree with u there. Ive gotten a few Really good ones, but im lvl 250 and spent 175 of those levels farming legendarys for my own use.  And any tse i found wanst lvl 50....which is annoying as hell.
---
Thank u so much ! !
---
You're the best 😀
---
Didnt they change that in the last update, same with sacrifical mod to machete, wont add star anymore
---
The assault rifle is still a good gun.  The recoil on it is very stable.  Two shot is considerably more accurate when actually aiming.
---
then add a blocking system. this isn't rocket science.
---
There isnt even a need to use stimpacks for the event. Just bring zero junk, cola nut and a ton of nuka colas. If you die, either get someone else to revive or die of and respawn.
---
 I once wasted 20 stimpaks on this one event XD
---
Thanks. Havent seen this one before. I know some of the location photos are also glitched. The name would come up in the view finder but I would not get credit for the photo. I had to relog and take the exact same photo for it to work. These may be related.
---
Thank you!  I was wondering why I hadn’t seen it. You rock!
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
i have a 4 star combat rifle. verry rare
---
I really hope it's not a battle royal, there's already enough BR ...
---
there are other reasons.
---
let me add something to this that i \*think\* might add some clarity. 
---
Survival and Adventure modes are accidentally triggering eachothers exceptions. Let me explain:
---
if you've been playing Adventure mode, took a Workshop, then put up some turrets. Bam, you'd get the Legendary Gatling Gun that's up for SURVIVAL mode only. 
---
I think Bethesda may have let a bit of code slip between games, and some exceptions aren't where they are supposed to be in this particular patch. I got 2 of those gatling guns before i realized. "wait,... this isnt survival mode. "
---
As an fyi, the asbestos chest mod really deals with the after affect burning damage from explosions. You might be better off with padded/dense for the initial explosive protection. The asbestos description can be a bit misleading.
---
Unfortunately, I have used them on 2 occasions, Rose and teh Daily I mentioned, outside that I nothing other than they Full under Licenced Plumber
---
Yes, the High capacity mod is glitched. So people are cheating and passing around the broken plan so they can all learn it without doing any work.
---
No Problem :D
---
*Laughs in no friends*
---
Always the way, I’d noticed almost every reply in every thread has been downvoted this afternoon 😂 
---
I absolutely love the franchise but it shouldn’t be beyond criticism.
---
Yup, they're garbage now for sure.
---
that's what I said. they need to turn adventure into the happy-go loving mode most people want it to be, with no griefing and maybe no real penalty to dying, and remove the bs limitations to pvp on survival.
---
and, imo, losing aid items. nobody plays survival for aid. all it does is make pvp harder because nobody has enough stims. it's like Bethesda doesn't want to alienate one playerbase from the other when it's obvious they don't want to coexist.
---
Really? I love seeing other players CAMPS. Even if they have nothing for sale. There are some truly creative folks out there.
---
Not sure, I don't run either Scorched killer or sacrificial, so it very well may have changed recently.
---
There is no update, there is no maintenance. she is already in game and simply needs to be turned on, just like the fasnacht event
---
I’d like to be able to play Pip-Boy games on them. Was surprised that you couldn’t.
---
No settlements need your help.
---
I see what you did there
---
“Do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing, and you’ll never be criticized.“
---
Okay
---
… spoiled Bio Fluid on the bed.
---
Do you honestly believe bethesda didn't screw up on any of the bans? Seriously? Because that would be the first time they did something without screwing up something in the process.
---
I mean I've seen plenty of people that were just traders and didn't dupe (they were far too poor to have duped) and yet they were banned during the first big ban wave for "having too much" of rare items, all because they used ultracite ammo as a currency because the cap limit of 25k is way too low.
---
lol :)
---
Subtitles seem to be getting worse and worse across gaming in general. Game developers seem to forget that that the average person will be playing on a relatively small TV across a room, not two feet away from a giant monitor. I am this close to going out of my way to personally send thank you cards to game studios that make UI actually readable from a couch 6-7 feet away on a 32-40 inch TV.
---
You sure? I wanted to offer it to the wonderful people of reddit before I put it in my machine.
---
Explosive delivery. A perk like that would be deadly in survival XD
---
Yea, i saw one at a Trading post with that machete mod, no extra star
---
i bet he's hoping a player with max caps will come and use it as a cap sink
---
I also put "joke" items for tons of case, i sold a 5,000 cap roll of toilet paper yesterday
---
While I dont disagree with you, I'm not sure if this is a bug or an intentional design. I was under the impression, the drill and chainsaw were supposed to be joke weapons. I dont understand the purpose of them either if they arent even minimally viable.
---
I actually con't recall seeing anyone use a Laser weapon in this game. Fusion Cells are pretty rare as well. Why not make them very comparable to their mechanic equivalents? It would make things so interesting. 
---
Laser Rifle comparable to a Handmade and Lever Action. They should also make a Laser Shotgun. I want TSE and Bloodied variants.
---
I saw a new Vault Dweller from that vault, impaled on a pike i think at the Raider Slopes? at the base camp. Spawn in, take a few steps, hanging on the left side near the main entrance. I thought it was peculiar, and wondered with my wife if it was indeed something new. Seems like a lot of the raider area is changing-- i noticed the railway station near there has also changed its interior.
---
need to find someone good on xbox filing system. 10 - 1 there still there waiting to be recovered unless that directory has been over - written.
---
Deep pocket mods can help with carry weight. +10 pound carry weight on limbs. +20 on chest (though I have asbestos on my marine chest piece, so gave this one up). I also have marsupial for another +20 carry weight.
---
I use it because it one shot things even at lesser events
---
They are all still the same. The nerfs barely did anything to TSE's.
---
Exactly man
---
Nope, but I noticed a large tree in the middle of my house that wasn’t there before.
---
"I largely stopped playing because Bethesda made it more difficult to earn free stuff. I don't care that it's free.... It should be easy to get too. And it's ruining the rest of the game for me....... Somehow"
---
You just made me hate people a little bit more.
---
Kinda wrong, kinda not. If you get a 3\* machete and put sacrificial blade on it it becomes 4\*. And i think there was some other weapon like this too.
---
They're there since day one
---
I'm X Kalomn btw
---
...while Grahm sings the best of Burt Bacharach!
---
Thanks do you know which one?
---
Some q star items give 3 and some five 5. Not sure why tho. All 2 star five 15 and all 3 star five 40 tho.
---
Just do what I did take over someone’s workshop, so they will kill you
---
Yeah, i read it was already inn and probably just activates by date, but was just wondering if you had read somewhere that we would get an hot fix / small patch today :)
---
I GUESS ONE CHANGE IS THAT PEOPLE POST THREAD TITLES IN ALL CAPS
---
Yeah, seriously... I saw one Plan at a vendor-bot for 12,000 caps yesterday.
---
I've sold a few different instigating rifles, an anti-armor combat rifle, instigating, vampiric and anti-armor melee weapons for 499 caps.  They fly off the shelf.  I'm just happy that newer/less geared up players are getting nice weapons that will help them farm their own legendary stuff.
---
I use a hybrid of X-01 and T-60. I have an X-01 torso w jet pack and helmet. The legs are calibrated T-60 and my arms are T-60. The shocks are easier to get and cheaper for T-60, and they’re way cheaper to repair.
---
i always thought they were just spawning like crazy-- pre patch, i made one run and got all of the outfits and the hats. musta been stupid lucky or something...
---
Dysentery + electrically charged? 😂
---
Nah, just that the purveyor will arrive 🤟
---
I try to get 10-20 for them. Unless I know they're super common, at which point, they're just free.
---
Okay, going to try if being in a team is the key here as I'm always solo.
---
That’s awesome. There should be a karma system for stuff like that in the game, because I’m always doing nice stuff. I’m just not sure how that programming algorithm would go. :)
---
I’m sure lots of people will want it. Just giving you a quick option without having to add someone. I’ve had 3 extra s’mores plan and just did that. But then I don’t want to add a random stranger. I’m weird like that.😆
---
Very unique and different approach and different is good.  I like the "tell a story" aspect of it all and hope your customers can see what you are trying to do.  I think your location as you describe it will point them there.  Good Luck!
---
They've always been there.
---
And in refrigerators, outhouses, etc...
---
hard bargain three, grape mentats, sweetroll, got it ty!
---
Exactly, I'm fine with some weird ass costumes and masks. Because it is what Fallout has always had. But it feels like too much this time. I want to decorate my camp with some barrels and crates and stuffs. But instead we get princess beds. Cant wait for the patch that will give us the option to decorate our camps with looted objects.
---
Unless its a horde of enemies or difficult, I always go melee regardless of event.
---
Campfire tales, free range are the latest I always go melee. Though I do keep a gun incase a scorhbeast shows up.
---
Things like Encryptide though I always take my TSE Gatling Gun though. Mainly I use it to try and thin the herd of the robots while the others are working on the sheepsquatch. 
---
Sometimes its just required though I agree a bit overkill for casual events that don't need it.
---
What I ended up doing is fill my photos  gallery then delete 2 , then I would take 3 pictures of said animal, when the “too many photo “ prompt would come up I would get credit
---
I don't care what you call me because it's amusing that you seem to think there's like one or two possible variations of racial slurs. 
---
Do you even know the shit people can come up with? Please take a real thinker, it doesn't even have to be racism. Bullying is a broad term.
---
I highly doubt that, as the lasers don't get damage boosts from the shotgun perks, enforcer, or skeet shooter. The TSE shotguns still out damage pretty much everything except for possibly Bloodied explosive shotguns at really low health.
---
sounds like your machine lost power
---
Yep common sense of the people playing this game is non existent. I mean how would you keep a fire going in real life. Pray It doesn't go out ? put some wood on it.... dumbasses
---
I think that all of the mannequins in the game are all synth robots in disguise. I've said it since fallout 4
---
There was a house somewhere in FO4 where 4 mannequins were all holding knives in a bathroom with a skeleton in the bath. I know the synth mannequins exist, I just need more evidence
---
Because that’s the gun I have? Who brings extra lower level weapons just in case you do an event with other people?
---
I actually built a camp last night, kept getting jumped by super mutants every 15 minutes or so. Ended up moving a couple of times until I settled down somewhere only to be pestered by stray cats. I'm ashamed to say this, but they made good stress relief when you've just spent the past 4 hours in a turf war with the super mutants who lived next to you.
---
Bringing back the previous customization sliders would go along way towards that probably
---
60 iirc
---
Sure, a screenshot on Xbox is also easy. But its still a screenshot of a screenshot.
---
The same happened to me, I have my Camp just  1 mile away from Watoga, I thought that I can get there whitout PA (without it I have the resistance of wet paper), I'm walking next to the overgrown ping things than the Sheepsquatch jumps on me, I died 3 seconds later.
---
Yes, right after the game officially released and attributed it to the random spawn spot. It was a nice surprise when it happened the first time.
---
I tried this for quite a while last night with no luck, but logged in once more this morning and found the camera. 
---
Thanks everyone for your input. 
---
I think the strategy of checking the cemetery and the monument, then switching servers was a good one.
---
i suggested using the personal terminals as a way to text chat.
---
Bloodied does more damage than fancy two or three stars, yes including explosive bullets. Only noobs count stars.
---
But we have drugs for that, and they do their purpose as you can work to craft them, and on the other hand the edge you get from magazines is so situatuonal that ignoring it is the most effective time mamagement method around them. They bring little value, they could be unique and cool mechanics, I support unique and fun not unreliable and boring.
---
I agree there. There should just be a huge bounty for camp destroyers.
---
True and i get along with that too.
---
If I don't get a drill from the purveyor I am going to be pissed.
---
Life is Strange does it that way and it's great.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about the bloatfly, it’s just a head though. No body.
---
Well, they're scattered throughout the CAMP, too... so you have to go deeper into the building to get the full pic. That's the goal. I like to hide and creep on visitors, some just beam in, check the first and beam out. 
---
Others explore, and I love watching it. I have little hidden things in the CAMP &amp; little setups of CAMP items designed to create an overall "tone".
---
I dunno. I hope I'm getting the point across. it's fun to try though.
---
Exactly what i mean - cause Encrypted is more endgame and it is more than valid to use it there imo
---
Its over, new Dailys \^\^
---
Actually, players sell serum recipes for 20000-25000 caps...
---
Well, theoretically the weeping angels are in the Fallout universe, since the Tardis was in the first Fallout game.
---
Add it to our CAMP's personal terminal.
---
I want it so bad 😔
---
Ok thank you for the confirmation
---
I’m down. I would totally roll for a legendary drill / shovel
---
Ok thx
---
TSEs are terrible at this point. and a proper specced build can oneshot most mobs.
---
I mean, it's my only gun. when making my builds, I don't think "oh, if I equip this card I'll be too strong and may oneshot something, better think of McBrainFungus!"
---
I *want* to oneshot everything.
---
C.A.M.P Collision detection issue, kind of hard to describe but here goes.
---
Platform: PS4, possibly all of them.
---
Pre Patch: It was possible to place oil lamps inside the windowed area of the steepled roof variant piece, as seen in the below video.
---
Post Patch 9, this is no longer possible as the oil lamps now jump to the top area of the steeple and are impossible to place inside. Placement is no longer possible.
---
Another bug:
---
Platform PS4, possibly all.
---
Mole Rats seem to have gained a few seconds of invincibility, they can be hit over and over and take no damage.
---
Also as to Mole Rats, they shouldn't be able to magically teleport far away from the player when they burrow. This doesn't make sense.
---
People can ask whatever they like.  Whether anyone will pay that price is left to be seen.  It doesn't really bother me.
---
Could you imagine if it uses the same pool as legendary drops, and you buy a 3* Weapon, roll a 1 and get a drill.
---
This game needs a slingshot.
---
I think a cool camp update would be fossil displays that require specific sorts of bones to craft.  Like a Sheepsquach skeleton display would require a Sheepsqich skull, spine, etc.
---
I'm set up near the monorail elevator. Up on a cliff, great view, built into the structure there so there's barely anything enemies can attack.
---
If this rock isn't in the atomic shop later.... RIOT!!
---
TBH-- the backpack quests are the worst in the game. Literally the worst. My wife and I played all day yesterday, and we knew EXACTLY how to power grind it out in less than 2 hours. When it came to the fucking "milk 10 brahmin" shit, the game stopped recognizing my wife had the plan for the brahmin pen, and so she picked up her pen once, and it poofed, never to be seen again. not even in the menu. I go and place one for her at her home, she tries it again, and it just gets stored as razorgrain. 
---
About there, we lost out patience for the game. We'd tolerated the ridiculous challenges, the unnecessary platforming, the inability to even complete some badge challenges AT ALL. but this was too much.
---
Fix your FUCKING GAME bethesda.
---
I got mine from the scorchbeast Queen, but I don’t think she drops them anymore :/
---
I will say that initially when I did this quest solo, I was annoyed that you couldn't just go and get wood from a fallen log, you had to specifically find the 'kindling' spawns.  I've only found two spawn points for them so just go back and forth between those.
---
Also, the Camp Counselor tells you that you shouldn't get the wet kindling, and if you collect any that spawns some ticks/bugs that attack.  So just don't collect the wet kindling to avoid extra mobs.
---
I'm just wanting something other than a legendary 1* crappy piece of wood armor or switch blade to drop from a 3* Enemy
---
i just built a small generator at my camp and took a pic of then scrapped it
---
Then I gues you don’t know anything about business in gaming as you would know sub based games fail horribly world of Warcraft and final fantasy realm reborn are like the only sub based games ever that are sucusssful
---
I wanted to make a slanted up bow for a boat camp I made.  I want to put them under floors to look like they are support slats, to make the one foundation camps look more sturdy. But for some reason they only snap to roof pieces even though the regular ones snap right to walls like nothing.
---
They patched that. It no longer adds a 4th star. So there are absolutely no 4 or 5 stars in the game.
---
At this point everything I’ve got is explosive, I tend to go melee for WS nukes or things like Campfire tales. 
---
 There does come a point where I can only tank so much, while waiting for people to get their tags in.
---
That first issue used to occur a couple patches ago with the power armor station and a few decor pieces. They would snap to the next level of where you were attempting to place them. So I know what you mean. 
---
I've also noticed my mutfruit trees place halfway into the ground now, and most crops struggle to be placed too. Something in the camps was altered definitely. 
---
And the mole rat issue I believe it the no damage bug I listed. Happens with wolves, and mongrels as well.
---
Yikes.  Thanks!
---
Wow, that's as expensive as the Sealed Specimen Jar I'm selling for 24900...
---
I love them. They are responsible for the anti-scorched serum or whatever. Really the good guys of the game.
---
I haven’t read any because I can’t see them.
---
Yeah i see your point. Thx for the heads up!
---
You don’t get upvotes for that dumdum.
---
The text on team invites etc. needs to be enlarged also.  I'm currently playing on a 60" TV 'only' at 1080p resolution and it's hard to read.  And I have 20/10 vision with my glasses on.
---
is THAT what the milk is for? I've just been drinking it for the nutrition
---
looooool at the passive aggressive post.
---
If youre Xbox I can make you a new one if you provide the mats.
---
I have practically every ammo type except shotgun and 556(that's what I use) listed for 1c a piece and haven't sold a single piece. Gonna have to just start dropping them on the ground again.
---
You have to get it in the atom shop, but it's free/costs 0 atoms (and according to Bethesda, should remain that way). After that it's in the last build menu under "misc. structures" I think.
---
Thanks everyone, super helpful information.
---
I did it with RadShield, very easy
---
Ahh, I see. Now that they do not seem to be in the SBQ loot pool that is pretty steep. Damn inflation.
---
My tse handmade is the only weapon I carry that isn’t a heavy.  I do also have a stealth sniper load out but that uses an instigating gauss rifle, but that’s just ridiculous in lower level areas lol.
---
Where are you getting your adhesive? I feel like I am always out of that and screws.
---
Sadly, because my INT is 15, it's getting crafted at 200% without any perks at all enabled.  Ugh
---
It depends on the event for me. 
---
Free range? I'm blasting everything around my cows into atoms (legendaries excluded) before they can get a hit in. Same thing with campfire tales, if you're that desperate for lvl6 stingwing experience, you're doing it wrong.
---
But events with a set boss, set legendary spawns, or like One Violent Night with lots of ghouls or potential spawns, I'll pull out the handmade and run it at 30-40% health so others can tag mobs.
---
I used to 1-shot the suicider mutants at the Fasnacht events, just because you can't trust a group of randos to take them out. I was there for a reason, and wasn't willing to rely on others knowing what to do.
---
I play solo 95% of the time. I only really join other people’s events for the big ones. SBQ, sheepsquatch. You can’t one shot those anyway.
---
Heavily seconded!!!
---
hi, i run a sneak rifle build, please post your build stats and perk cards, im not sure how you are getting such high numbers
---
i have all the rifleman perks, anti tank, and concentrated fire, all the sneak cards and mr sandman, bloodied mess, tenderizer etc etc
---
im sure i havent missed any cards that can boost damage...
---
Where in WS? I couldn't find one in the stores
---
Yeah something is stirring and the vaults are making a big appearance. Seems like 94 must have recently opened. I read the terminals there and apparently 94 was opened by its overseer to help the outside world.
---
You okay bro?
---
They were literal communists but maybe that isn't such a bad way to rebuild
---
Unfortunately my INT is high, so they get crafted at 200% condition :(
---
I don’t think Bethesda wants us to choose. 
---
More choice means we get the weapons we want faster  which equals less play time. 
---
Big data probably tells them less play time is a no-no for their micro transactions
---
Do you all not view it in your pip boy or am I missing the point here?
---
There is already an unofficial list:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm96og/unofficial\_but\_comprehensive\_bug\_roundup\_patch\_90/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm96og/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_90/)
---
And an official list:
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback)
---
So at most this is 'yet another unofficial list'.
---
They very well could be but I've been past this point loads of times and have never noticed them. Since the sheepsquatch update I've found three with no effort
---
Where is this crossbow?
---
Overpricing items does not make you a scammer, it makes you a terrible merchant.  I have stumbled upon many people selling things that are not particularly good for ridiculous prices.  
---
My rule of thumb is to sell an item based on its main effect.  To me, that determines its worth.  The other affects work the same way.  Generally I never go over 500 Caps on a 1 Star with a valued effect like Bloodied, Anti-Armor, and Two Shot.  If the second effect for a weapon is Explosive for guns or Swing Speed or Power Attack, the weapon also factors.  If they are good combos, I raise the price to about 2500 to 5000 Caps.  I would never spend like 10k Caps for something and I expect no one else to.  As for 3 Stars, I could care less for them.  Do you really need a point in a special stat?
---
And I have been to CAMPS were people we selling weapons that were not Legendary.  They were farmed at WestTek if I had to guess.  It sucks worse when you waste your Caps to fast travel to a CAMP with garbage.
---
Yes that sounds brilliant, beth should definitely consider this as it brings back value to these items again.
---
Hi Drax!
---
I did too, and had the problem anyway. What I did to fix was copy the entire [archive] section directly from Fallout76.ini
---
Never noticed them but glad to know!
---
Well the question was why. The intention. That it is a one shot wonder i think we know lol
---
Lol.  I'll put that down as a positive experience for you. See the headline!! 
---
 "Mad Pooper Enjoys Bethesda's Newest Update". Open bag for more details.
---
Case in point 😂 this is why we dont have nice things
---
This is actually in game already iirc, or at least it works in the dirt track workshop as I've scrapped those large tyres and the cars lying around for junk - just pop into Modify mode and the option is there when you target the item (Xbox btw).
---
Don't really build workshops much other than to grab one for plans then move on so not sure if it works elsewhere, but it 100% works at this particular site.
---
Bloodied explosive
---
Sometimes players sell them for 3-5k
---
Circle the airport getting chems. Try to unlock rank 3 or pharma farma. Will do wonders my man.
---
Or if your PC I'd be glad to help.
---
I am, does it require one or can you make it from scratch too?
---
Drugs are bad....mmmkay
---
Holotapes are in the effects category, they don't have their own category. This means that things in the effects category (like gunshots) will also be max volume and it will still be difficult to hear the holotape over them.
---
you two should go get a room and fight it out under the sheets
---
Curiosity makes you a commie?
---
Commie Whacker
---
Fasnacht and campfire mobs are so low level that it's impossible not to one hit them, and I use a basic gun for those, not a good legendary. Things like AWOL I'll certainly not one hit things if other players are there.
---
https://youtu.be/K1paTIGxOd0
---
That's expensive. I'm only asking 20420 for my toxic mutagenic waste.
---
Don't delay it
---
Oh, yeah, those guys. I mean, they did have a robot theme but they weren't actually robots so they weren't exactly the first thing that came to mind.
---
Would have been neat if Automatron and Nuka World could cross over like that. Just have, idunno, an optional compatibility patch or something.
---
for some reason i keep hearing useless shit from people who haven't reached endgame yet. my friend and I have each made over 100k playing pvp, its now down to zero. but then again why am i talking to you , go level up and reach endgame then maybe you can comment
---
Seems like in the world of fallout post nuke communism would work really well. Especially in small groups of 50-100 or whatever. Harder for the corruption to be out of control when everyone from the top down has to contribute.
---
Just the sharing that’s implied.
---
Don't you see how many posts there are daily about how hard the daily challenges are now?
---
 Do you know what that tells me ? Every single one of those people will never spend a dime on Atoms.  Their only concern is how to get free ones easy in game.
---
Then you have people like myself who have no interest at all in outfits ,skins or anything like that.  I would never spend a dime on any that stuff. Mot because I don't have money because none of that shit interests me.
---
 I'm sure there are no simple fixes because every single player is different. All I was saying is if they ever want more money out of me they're going to have to charge me subscription fee or charge me for downloadable content. Otherwise the $60 I spent on  preordering is all they will ever get out me with this game.
---
 Maybe my opening statement was wrong and they do need money but since I've been watching this game from release they have made it harder and harder for anybody to get anything free thats worthwhile in this game. 
---
 I know they said they would never do it but it would not surprise me if they started charging Atom's for 3 star legendaries on the atom shop.
---
Have they said anything about improving this feature in the future? Id kill for some sort of transaction log connected to the new vending machines
---
Its the opposite for me. One legendary out of three complete runs on the same server last night. Just have crappy RNG
---
I agree, the enemies collapse from sheer terror when you come at them with 2 DPS.
---
&gt;No mods needed, just looking for the base gun.
---
Glad you pointed that out...that would have been a deal breaker...not the fact that your very specific request can take about 400 hours to fulfill.
---
Yes, ever since I shot suzie the mannequin in the frat house. She had a physics bug out and was vibrating up and down really hard then suddenly stopped. So I pooped myself and then went back to my camp. Bam, mannequins.
---
I'm not sure but I just tried a tse plasma Gatling against the sbq yesterday and it's still seems pretty OP
---
Boosting teams already happen. This changes nothing
---
I think it would be a good idea, i just think if they were to do it they would need to tweak some of the bobble heads. For example with the caps one, it could be similar to that luck based skill in fallout 4 where enemies killed would blow up into caps or something (i cant remember the skill fully). I do get what you mean though, if they did do this, some of the bobbleheads and mags would become irrelevant so i can understand your perspective.
---
Yes yes all of the yes
---
I can add a bladed mod for 75,000c to make it even more overpowered.
---
well, mine is filled with Scorchedbeast King semen, so....
---
Many players have had no experience with trading before, in either world I imagine.  I think they will figure it out before long.  I have had to reassess my prices on some things and make adjustments too, and it hasn't always been to lower them.
---
Set up as in camp? Id be interested to see it lol
---
Is boosting a crime? The comparison is off in my opinion
---
Everything in your vending machine will automatically unlist if the machine gets stored in your camp. If you remodel your camp, dont store your machines, just move them around. If you move camp locations...ya, it'll all go into storage.
---
It's electrically charged.
---
Nope can make them from scratch. My GT is Xwolfpackleader
---
Idk. I have asbestos and can stand on top of a car, blow it up and not lose any health. I do have one point in Fireproof and I also have healing factor. So it could be those things.
---
But true about the burning, asbestos makes you invulnerable to fire. You can stand in the middle of it with no effect.
---
I'd also really like to have the half/quarter upper floors be available in the atom shop styles I've purchased.
---
Nope.. it is just ridiculous at this point... the same daily challenges and the weekly 3 of the 5 are picture things... I get the want people to buy atoms but this is just to much of a chore
---
I wouldn't even turn up to a 'defend x workshop' event with a gun lol.
---
Unless its the ammunition factory with a scorchbeast again lol
---
Didn't your mommy ever tell you if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it at all. This is a positive post aimed towards helping people and raising awareness of issues. So leave or ill throw my prince frog jar at you.
---
Yeah it was all sort of washed out white and green. Made the game pretty bland. They did better with 4 but this one seems like stuff might actually live here.
---
Interesting.  I'll have to give it a go tonight!
---
I would like to see this feature added as well. I play on Xbox too and have been dealing with the cut off since the beta..
---
"tell them to switch to a less OP weapon"
---
So people should nerf themselves? That suggestion is the most ridiculous argument in my opinion
---
40, 15 and 5 for 3, 2 and 1 star weapons, respectively. 24, 9 and 3 for 3, 2 and 1 star armors, respectively.
---
Guess it depends on what kinda build you’re going for, but nonetheless the following weapons are awesome. 
---
Furious explosive Gatling gun, vampire super sledge with 40% faster swing, anti armor explosive lever action rifle
---
Yeah, it would be difficult with consoles though. On pc it would be insanely helpful though!
---
Map &gt; Challenges &gt; World, they're listed there. Agreed it's not very intuitive.
---
I got a fixer from sheepsquatch quest but it’s only level 30 and I didn’t see a plan in my inventory. Does that mean I already learned it and can craft a level 50 version?
---
Since i'm the least honorable i'll be the one saying surprise buttsex. I don't think the stealthboys will save him :(
---
Alright thanks
---
If you are not running the controller wired. Check and make sure there is nothing between your ps4 and the controller that could cause interference. Bluetooth speakers, routers, and stuff like that
---
They do not bring little value.  A 30 minute buff that gives you a 20% chance to avoid damage from scorched may be situational, but it's a good buff - way too good to have as a permanent effect.  A 30 minute buff that gives you a 30% chance to avoid melee damage is also very good, as there are a large number of enemies that have at least some melee damage.  A 30 minute buff that reduces all robot damage by 25% is very good and too good to have as a permanent benefit, especially if you stack it with 5 pieces of Troubleshooters and lone wanderer (on top of damage reduction  from ballistic and energy) and I can think of at least one Baaaa-d assaultron that reducing the damage by 25% has helped me in the fight.  Even a 30 minute buff that does something as simple as -10% damage from players without the 75% chance of it working like we now have with Assassins is nice and reliable. 
---
If they were made permanent, people would gravitate to the few that were Meta and it would be boring and cookie cutter again. As I said, they currently fit roles that don't make sense as chems or alcohol, and they are able to stack with them. They are also more powerful than chems, where chems at best just give you a bonus flat number to your damage resist, the magazines give a % bonus to your damage resistance.
---
I had to do it fifteen times before i finally got a badge, it's either a very low chance or we just have bad luck
---
Not necessarily the problem you are having, but I read that the controllers are known for this issue.  Mine tends to drift left.  To get it to stop, I move the right stick to the right and blow into the left side of the stick.  Can of air would probably work better though.
---
I know it wasnt their intent with the game but I would like some friendly NPCs. I like the idea of making my camp into a small town, it was a fun idea in FO4 that was done really badly. Would be a neat addition if it was done right.
---
Yeah it's getting a little out of hand. There is just so many better things they could do as challenges
---
I wish I had an easy way of sending photos to players that are in my photos. For example, a friend aggro'd the bots inside Whitespring and I took some pretty hilarious photos of him and the carnage that ensued. It would be nice if the game automagically shared the photos of him with him. Same goes for a SBQ I took photos at last night while trying to complete weekly challenges. Got a lot of players in my photos of the battlefield carnage.
---
Oh, and the object/player/enemy recognition distance needs to be increased significantly. It should be at least as far as the rage when you point with a gun and the name pops up on screen.
---
Well if you do one I’ll take it
---
Between my gaming seat and my ps is nothing but air.
---
Oh sod off this is like the hundredth time it's been posted
---
Can confirm... Tried upgrading my legendaries for the Purveyor 😅
---
Did it fifteen myself until the first one, it's rough
---
I shit i figured they would have grouped it together with pip boy radio, sorry for my misinformation.
---
You cant find a gun that melts enemies for just 1000 caps
---
Don't be a dick. That holotape means nothing to me as well. If you want to be nice instead of mouthing off, I'll be happy to hear what makes it relevant.
---
Nice! Where is this and are you able to snag their vault suits? Would love to have a vault suit from another vault so I’m just wondering if there’s any way to get them
---
You know it's bad if a Raider is asking if you're ok
---
but yeah the challenges are loopy at times
---
What is B25?
---
Pics? 🙃
---
It will be a unique legendary Dragon called "WTF"
---
It will be a Furious, faster fire rate, +1 strength
---
Well it gives you the objective to complete World Challenges, so if you go into the World Challenges menu you will find a whole new set of tadpole challenges
---
tesla rifle, but not all the time. plasma, laser
---
For under 1k your best best is an anti armor, or bloodied weapon. Mods are very important as well
---
The radstag hide outfit has clipping issues with any under armor so I feel your pain.
---
sure, i’ll send you them when i’m on later
---
I use a AA switchblade for low to mid level events, I believe that the damage is 92 in my build.  Enough to cause damage but not enough to one shot.  
---
For endgame events, TSE shotgun or TSE handmade is the choice.
---
It really depends on how you plan on playing, whether or not you're going to be solo or grouped, power armor or regular armor, melee or ranged, stealthy or not worried about stealth, Vats or manual aiming, etc.
---
I can't promise these are the best builds as ive not looked at them all but they are all good starting points for any build you want to make for yourself.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9w1sjj/fo76_builds_compilation/
---
The camera viewfinder lists specific actors and landmarks currently in frame before you take a picture.  These sorts of challenges can't be completed with Photomode.
---
I mean you can get an SMG but then you'll need about 10,000 caps worth of .308
---
Right? I have no idea what's going on.
---
Not for that price. Maybe 7 to 15 times that price though.
---
For weight and hotkey reasons, many players simply don't bother carrying a weak  weapon. I carry a trash lever rifle to save on shotgun ammo but it'll still easily one-shot common Forest mobs.
---
Right.. it's to bad there is no real way to start a in game boycott... haha
---
Interesting that we get less because of armor but they cost the same to purchase new items from purveyor regardless of weapon or armor. I’ll be saving all my weapons going forward since they carry higher value.
---
Just take over a workshop and wait
---
Will do, thanks
---
Take a picture of another player taking a picture of another player taking a picture of Graham taking a picture of the tourist in a C.A.M.P. in a nuke zone while everybody is naked dancing around a campfire.
---
I think some people just use the weapons they always use, and then they carelessly one shot enemies without considering other players’ potential XP or loot. 
---
This drives me crazy at uranium fever. Pretty much everyone is there for the legendary item, and then someone one shot kills the legendary enemy.
---
Please explain how I was mean to the poor OP (who has deleted this post already). Stating facts isn't being mean.
---
Shh soon they'll nerf it
---
Supposedly you can use a flamer to bash enemies and it counts.
---
*gathers Raiders and Responders in front of Whitesprings and gives them "Jobs" signs*
---
These are the same people who are always barging into my space and firing explosive shells right next to me to steal kills, I end up with no loot but mostly with the choice of ReSpawn or calling for help. I just respawn at my camp then carry on doing something else somewhere else.
---
These weapons are available so if people use them I can't complain, I still hate them.
---
Trust me, I'm also bloodied but if you have healing factor and stay hidden you should outheal the damage
---
ps4 as well, in some screens,like social, I only have half the screen names
---
That will be worth 10 atoms
---
To add to this maybe highlight your dropped bag of junk? I always have to ask a friend to find it for me.
---
Buffout pls, I have so many mentats but can rarely make bufftats
---
Their unveiling of the battle Royale game mode is already going to restart the hate machine for fallout 76. 
---
They really should be doing everything they can to KEEP PUBLIC OPINION EITHER NEUTRAL OR MAKE IT POSITIVE.
---
Taking aspects from new vegas will do nothing but anger the new vegas diehard fanboys and start more YouTube clickbait.
---
They're already gonna get enough hate for battle Royale.
---
Ah, thank you. It says I've done 3 out of 4 Demonstrate Values on the side quests.. No idea how I got those, what do you do for that?
---
Also what's with people on the terminals doing the exams, do they get you anything.
---
Sorry for all questions and thank u.
---
My stance is thus: I will happily buy atoms, but only to cover half the cost of what I want from the store. So, if I want that 1400 atom PA skin, I'll need to earn 700 doing dailies/etc. The harder Beth makes it to hit that number, the longer it will be before I pay them. 
---
I feel a lot of people are going to operate similarly, even if they don't have strict rules they've set for themselves. At the end of the day, Beth is just shooting itself in the foot making up these absurd challenges.
---
Got two of the mods personally. Wouldn't advise them if carry weight is your priority
---
seriously craft a serum? Those recipes are like 17k
---
Go to the website that shall not be named that rhymes with parket and get a serum recipe there for 3500
---
In the purveyor screenshot I saw, armor was cheaper than weapons for the same star count. Was that changed?
---
Other threads are saying bashing counts as melting as long as you have the flamer just equipped- don't have to use up fuel.
---
Yea I've had a ps controller die like that but this is on 3 and 2 are new, like I bought one of the 2 last week
---
Yes sir, the Electrician badge
---
Why are you on the reddit page and actively commenting on a game you don't play...?
---
I even don't know there was a RE and my first encounter were also those maniacs. After some server hops a dead raider with side quest.... So ever start in the game with a RE in front of the door is really funny
---
I’d have to check but pretty sure Psychotats are available as I role play a raider and craft that. I might be mistaken or buff tats but pretty sure one not
---
The drifter outfit collar has clipped through longer hairstyles since FO4... 
---
I know I’m being optimistic but I’d love for my character’s creepy look to be fixed!
---
Thank you, will have to get that next time I see the event live.
---
The exams are part of the world challenges, you need to pass them to get the badges. Not sure about your other question, sorry.
---
You XBOX?
---
It’s Psychobuff that’s available as a recipe.
---
I don't think it would be much different than all the racing games that have custom livery you can create for your cars in those games, and everyone can see them and some games you can even buy them off other players.
---
I'm usually down to about 25 HP.  I'd have to lose a lot of Rads.
---
its part server lag. also likes to turn the controller OFF.
---
Lol. OP just needs a flamer, laser or plasma weapon. Doesn't even need to be legendary.
---
or dumped every other possible weapon to keep carry weight below 200
---
Are you serious? Because if so I need your location.
---
Hey man, in the apocalypse optimism is all you can have
---
I think -- SWAG -- that the unlockable toggle will show/hide those things that you might know, but do/don't have the applicable perks to build, respectively.
---
Oops you’re right. It was ranged and melee weapons that were both 100. Armor is 60. Thanks!
---
So the patch notes specifically said they were increasing spoilage and breakage rates? I didn't see it. It seems like paranoid speculation.
---
And I guess backpacks are clipping through chairs now too (not so much my electric chair, mind...)
---
Yes, more efficient, especially with 5xweapon weigh reduction gear on a mule. You can perk down 50% for armor weight and then ultra-light all pieces but that is for crazy people. And you need all the plans for each armor type.
---
Because there is no content where you would need buffs.
---
I wasn't necessarily replying to you, but the poster above. 
---
I must've missed your GT in the video, and description. 
---
The only GT I saw was the degraw one. But I was being serious about testing this for you, because I haven't had this issue at all, so if it is happening to you and can be captured on both the buyers and sellers side, then I think you could raise a bit of hell with Bethesda.
---
My response was more geared towards the people refuting the possible explanation, then swearing that it was wrong and all bethesda's fault, when you were away and not providing any additional info.
---
I understand that.
---
Had it happen a few times yes but not so often anymore sorry
---
It kind of figured that I'd try the one fedora that doesn't work and not remember about my White Wolf Fedora.
---
This was sunny ski top but I have found two more in various other places. Unfortunately you can't take their suits or loot their body
---
Everyone should just put on passive mode and chuck grenades everywhere
---
Just got a max level tse gatling on my level 28 alt this morning. From a super mutant at red rocket near the galleria. Only those two stars but pretty good.
---
It worked. Thanks man
---
Either give energy weapons inherent armor piercing capabilities for nearly every receiver, or drastically reduce the energy resistances of most enemies using metal as armor, or enemies made of metal. Robots should be very weak to energy weapons, but most of them have near-equal defense to both ballistic, and energy defense.
---
The only enemies that have a right to be strong against energy weapons are wildlife, and targets with thick leather hides, or leather-like armor.  So, ghouls, animals, and maybe scorched.
---
Grenadier effects thrown explosives, not the grenade launcher or explosive guns.
---
That is a good way to go about it... but I refuse to give to game any money other then what I bought the game for... if REAL dlc stuff came out I'd buy it... I mean I've bought all the DLC for every other Bethesda title there is but I wouldn't buy that horse armor haha
---
Thank you for the quick response
---
It's too late, and also it's a bad idea.
---
Don't shoot at all. It's super bugged. 9/10 the nuke blows up in your face, no matter where you are and where you were aiming. Not to mention mini nukes deal like same amount of damage than lvl 20 rifle... That's why I sold my mini nukes for 10 caps each
---
Fair enough, I was tired, I completely agree I was being a dick. I shouldn't have and I regret it. In my tired state I thought they were being a jerk about it, but now I realize it was probably genuine confusion and I'm the asshole lmao.
---
I should have explained that the holotapes are recordings from survivors, so far they lead to a few of these crates with different stories in them, and hopefully will lead into some crazy questline.
---
Yeah, it will show what you're able to craft with the resources and cards you have.
---
Magazines, in my opinion, should no matter what stay as temporary buffs.  There are quite a few of them, and as magazines we already had this precedence set as temporary buffs in Fallout NV 
---
I have no problem with them adding new permanent perks like we got from things like Companions - shoot that could be an addition if they ever implement a faction where something like "BoS faction get bonus to fusion cores" and "Raiders get bonus from Chem use", 
---
I just get hesitant when people don't think of the big picture, it "seems" easy to just make this change, but there's coding, balance, gameplay, and other considerations.  I mean, for example, what would people be doing the day after a change was made do? Is it REALLY that big of an issue to have them as consumables rather than them use the resources to work on a different QoL issue?
---
13.5% chance for three cards. 10.5% and 7.5% for two or one.
---
I would guess that it fills the bar completely, but I don't use VATS unless I'm shooting bugs.
---
same problem with one of mine.need to try that.
---
the sensors are hall effect tho,so shouldn't be affected by dirt, note I said shouldn't.
---
This would be a great change.
---
I cannot access that spreadsheet you have linked but you are welcome to use the ones I made for myself.
---
They are not fancy or anything but I think they are complete:

Weapons:

Armor (it is possible that the errors listed in the Robot armor may have been fixed, not sure, been a while):

---
Thats a pretty good drop
---
I realized that, sorry Todd Howard
---
Haha everyone we are going to have to ask you to lay down your arms and join us for... a sit down... and then everyone throw your camera down in the middle and we will NUKE THE DAMN THINGS!!!! haha
---
Thank you. Tbh I'm always an asshole.
---
Yea that's what I'm thinking too
---
This! I wish if you had pacifist on, your bullets would travel through other players instead of hitting them. Trying to tag ghouls at WS when all the melee players clog up the door by the staircase is next to impossible. I shouldn't be forced to use tesla to get my tags. I'm thankful the SBQ is so big or else I'd have the same problem, but it still does negatively affect my DPS as some of my shots still do hit melee players.
---
There are ways to participate in combat without killing things. The game needs to recognize that. If you're healing everyone or acting as a conduit only at Encryptid, then you helped. You shouldn't have to worry about tagging the imposter. I'd be fine with reduced XP. Likewise if I'm focused on taking out the adds at SBQ, then I should still get all her loot and some xp as I did contribute to the battle by allowing other players to focus on her. I've had times where I was the one doing the most damage and people keeping the freaking bugs and scorched off me was invaluable. Having to switch from my exploding weapon to kill something that's right on top of me when no one is helping with adds ticks me off to no end.
---
With the recent issue with glitching/duping, I'm surprised we don't see more for reasonable prices. I have healing factor and adrenal reaction recipes for sale in my vending for the rock bottom prices of 4k, and 6k. 
---
I received them as part of a trade deal, but didn't question how the last guy got them.
---
Other people want that loot too.
---
I've run enough campfire events now that it's starting to become an issue.  If there is a lower level there and hoping for a decent drop from the final 'boss', and you 1 shot it, *you* get a crappy 5 scrip trash item, and the level 20 person gets nothing.  Ran into the same issue with the Fasnacht event.  On the sheepsquatch or SBQ fights, it's a non-issue.
---
It's not that hard to have a plinker on you for things like that.  I have a 2-shot western revolver for dealing with low level scorched or for easy bosses, since wasting .50 cal on them seems pointless (and I never seem to drop below 1000 ammo for that thing somehow).  It' s common courtesy to give everyone else a chance at loot.
---
I thought it wouldn't be for me either in the beginning, but I am really starting to enjoy it.  I'm not addicted to trying to see everyone's camp though.  I usually try to look around at the ones that are close to wherever I'm at and walk to them.  Some players are very, very proud of what they are selling, I agree.  I have found some really great items that were right for the price though.  Good thing is, you can always say , "No, thanks."  I hope it all grows on you over time.
---
Can you not trade them anymore? When they went live I gave 2 away, guess they changed it.
---
You're lucky. I've never even found the kindling.  xD. I just run around the trees where i've seen other people go during this part of the quest, spam e, and pretend like I'm bringing something back.
---
I'm 100% hoping for this - being able to post stuff to my other character would be appreciated, plus it would be nice to send people gifts/weird stuff.
---
Grenadier does seem to affect the m79 and AGL in my experience. I have noticeably smaller kill radius with those weapons when I swap to utility perks and forget to swap grenadier back in.
---
Up, Je chercher cette recette moi aussi
---
This is where we're at. We're demanding to know if aluminum is duped. Witch hunting isn't just for gear anymore ;)
---
I know it works, I was trying to say I thought it was suppose to be a tool by itself where you could just click on environmental objects and remove them without having to place an object.
---
Probably sell- that’s a pretty solid roll for pve
---
Yep. Mine seem to clear out on a regular basis. If I had to guess, I'd say it's some mechanic they introduced when they put in that personal terminal, since that's clearly where they want you to go to organize your dailies.
---
It's true.  I have the plan for the hi-cap backpack, but I've already made it.  I'm sure that will get patched out eventually.
---
I clearly wasn't the only one to downvote you, but okay
---
It’s not solved yet
---
I did for the 30 achievement. Just get as many 10, 9, and 7 as possible. Perfect 26
---
Bulking ammo should be made to use cloth or wood since they are normally packed in boxes.
---
Yeah that’d be cool too. What I don’t want to see is what some are suggesting an making it a huge deal within the game. There are groups for things like that on instagram and Facebook. They should keep focus on playable and QoL things like they’ve been doing.
---
Cheap plans and useful junk seem to do the best for me. I had bobbles in there for several without selling before I reduced them to 75 and someone bought a bunch. Stimpacks if you have a reliable farm system will do well if they are also cheap (&lt;10c). 
---
I also look for cheap legendaries as well. I don’t necessarily have time to farm for them anymore so if I can pick up garbage rolls for sub 200 caps I can then recycle for the script, I do that.
---
Arable land.
---
Just in case you’re actually butt hurt

How is this not adding something to the “world” for everyone to enjoy and experience something rare and new in game? I have a working electric chair in my trading camp that shoots sparks but doesn’t hurt you, don’t you want to see that? Don’t you want to someone shoot you off a cliff “Jug” style? I know I do :)
---
I eventually got 3x Yao Guai in the flooded trainyard after serving hopping. Could swear i got bloatflys there before also but could never get them this time.
---
For all my gambling needs a just got loads of lucky clothing and implants
---
Lol.  Sorry if that bothered you there Frito.  I"m and old man and quite deaf and I just want everyone to hear me.
---
I ran into a legendary toxic sheepsquatch in front of Haven Church in the Mire.  Just about crapped my pants while I was running to a broken bus to hide in with this thing howling and chasing me.  I put 3 magazines of gatling plasma into it before it finally went down.
---
You can get the Scorched receiver plans at the Firebreather fire department from the chiefs pc at the first floor :)
---
Sell it for caps mate, that's a 2-3k piece all day.
---
Do you know how easy it is to legitimately fill up multiple accounts with legitimate gameplay? Less than 1% of the population dupes. This is from Bethesda. Cut it with the witch hunt. You're unlikely to find an actual witch.
---
Pretty good roll. Definitely sell for caps or trade.
---
Thank you for doing this!
---
Seems like player vending has recalibrated ammo going rates. Used to be 1c per shotgun shell. Now those have moved up to 5 or more each to accommodate 1c/each on fusion cells, 38, or 10mm.
---
Internally it calls "Mod Player Explosion Scale", which I'd have expected to apply to all explosions ("Mod Player Explosion Damage" apparently does), but then Fallout 76 is spaghetti code so you really would need a test.
---
I mean it makes sense, what we find out in the wasteland is what our homes should also look like. Almost every base i come across is some nice looking brightly lit colorful thing and then you go out in the wasteland and it sticks out like a sore thumb lol
---
My laser turns then into Ash piles regular, does that count?
---
At least it's not raining
---
Yeah, put it up for caps, unless you're at/near the hard limit. If you're going to use the camp vendor, remember that people can't inspect legendaries unless you're actually at your camp -- can make it hard to move anything higher than one star.
---
&gt; And what you're saying about waiting kind of defeats your point about it being fast lol. But anyway, all of this is ignoring the fact that you shouldn't even have to play a stupid game of server hopping. It's simply bad game design and anti-fun.
---
Meh not really to the first sentence, and absolutely 100% to the rest. The problem is the game was designed for single player and then they used that platform for a multiplayer game and a lot of the things that were just fine for a single player game were a tremendous issue with multiplayer. 
---
Mob spawning, for instance, is garbage for a multiplayer game. It's obviously the exact same mechanic as the singleplayer fo. Then when people started abusing the respawn mechanics (because they're fucking horrendous and counter intuitive) Bethesda patched them up. Cmon beth, we need more spawn in nuke zones. You shouldn't get like 1/4 of a clear then have to leave for 30 minutes because someone else cleared a building. It's far more profitable to server hop for end game farming these days. So in essence, they're not only not fixing the server hop issues, they're making it more necessary.
---
wait, so our houses CANT be destroyed in survival?
---
well that makes me almost want to try survival for the first time, i just knew that if i tried survival my house would get destroyed super fast
---
I'd expect insulated to give energy resistance.
---
If u r on ps4 I'm interested
---
What platform?  If ps4 I’ll give you 2k caps
---
I thought buffout and med-x were craftable? I'me pretty sure I have those recipes.
---
I use psychotats too, so it's a pain finding them without pharma farma.
---
Yeah, cuz the Responders help them all by themselves.
---
If it's a serum recipe, that's what they go for on market. It's around 16,100 at the enclave vendor with buffs, so you save \~4k
---
Thanks for that.
---
There is also a lvl 3 terminal at the Garrahan State first floor; unlocks the door to the first true dissapointment on my FO76 'careeer': a Minigun with a sweet paintjob that becomes a regular Minigun as soon as you pick it up :D
---
I have roughly 100 magazines I'd sell you for 7k caps =)
---
I would keep your eye out for 1* instigating melee weapons, if I had one to sell I wouldn’t expect anyone to pay anywhere near 1000 caps, that will do double damage if target is full heath so as long as your not mutated with plague walker etc you would be able to 1 hit a lot of things, you may be lucky enough to find multi purpose axe, fire axe or even a sledge at a fair price if it’s only 1*. I’ve seen 1* bloodied melee weapons going for a couple of hundred caps which I’ve bought to scrap for scrip so they are definitely out there too if you’re tempted to use a low health build but perks and weapon mods are very important too to maximise your damage output. Personally I love instigating and have been using a lvl 35 instigating fire axe for the longest time even though I’m lvl 205 lol, with a glowing merat steak, adrenal reaction and lvl 1 of each slugger, martial artist and incisor perk I can 1 hit the charred ghouls at whitesprings and the wendigo is 2 swipes, so basically check as many vending machines as you can because most folk have max scrip now and will be popping their 1 and 2 star items in their vending machines I would think.
---
You're mistaken. There's no Psychotats recipe in the game's data, only Psychobuff and Bufftats.
---
thats good for a stealth build. double times 3.5.
---
Defend your statement. I'd love to hear why you think that, as that's not the impression I got at all.
---
Bethesda took the fun legendary grind from Fallout 4 and turned it into a money making mechanism.
---
You won't get good loot. Your odds of getting a handmade or lever gun aren't 1 in 44 because they have the RNG heavily weighted towards you getting a single action revolver. Your odds of rolling anti armor aren't 1 in 23 because they have the RNG weighted towards you getting a Nocturnal. There won't be any buffs to crappy legendary effects because they are intended to be crappy so that you will keep playing until you get a good legendary.
---
Grinding for legendaries is the endgame content and they intend to keep you doing it for as long as possible.
---
That's a hard no
---
Stop camping spawn locations and respawn elsewhere
---
So literally nothing today?
---
That is such a crappy drop rate though. That's like.. 1 badge every 1.5 hours? Uuuugh.
---
Did you get any other good drops to make it worth it?
---
I’m thinking about spamming vats crits for pvp. And wondering which would be better with a faster fire rate handmade. Four leaf clover or crit savvy since I only have room for one or the other. Also wondering wether 25% vats cost would be better than crit meter refill for vats “up time”
---
Or you can have a teammate make 4 locked terminals in their CAMP and get them all in one place.
---
My feeling as well, got a bunch of explosive weapons through farming and won’t let any of them go even though the dupers ruined their effectiveness.
---
Claiming workshops, defending your own workshops, and also defending other people’s workshops all give plans as rewards.
---
Honestly, I like the Responders a lot, which makes me angry that every NPC is dead. Their origins make a lot of sense, as typically in Fallout games and wasteland games all law and order just disappear with no thoughts to what the fairly well armed and trained men and women of first responders would do. I feel like that the ones in my area would do the same in a catastrophic situation.
---
They all are, you can buy the plans (recipe) in the medical wing in the enclave bunker.
---
That is worth waaaaaayyyyyy more than 2000 caps people here are offering. I would say 10k+. Really good effects.
---
It sometimes can, sometimes can't. Haven't figured it out yet.
---
Purveyors comes Thursday 🤷‍♂️
---
I don't think so, apart from the new wave of weekly challenges. The nearest DLC comes out this Thursday. The following one is going to be released next Tuesday.
---
Fridge didn't work for you? Interesting.
---
This is a list of recipes in game composed by this reddit user. Unfortunately they are not in the game database.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9kw47/fallout_76_recipe_check_list_unfinished/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Ok, they do not bring little value as long as your build sucks, if it doesn't suck, they don't bring any, and time and intellectual capabilities spent for bobblehead management is wasted.
---
When you're still leveling up (at least until 50, if not much longer), treat your camp like a mobile home.  You'll move on to far-away parts of the map frequently, and the cost of moving your camp is small compared to constantly fast-traveling back and forth.  A simple camp that can easily be placed somewhere convenient will make your life a lot easier.
---
After you're into end-game stuff, you'll have all the time in the world to make a castle, but they're a lot harder to pack up and move if you suddenly find the location inconvenient.
---
Yep, and Lode Bearing as well.
---
Haha classic!
---
Yep, I experienced it, too.  VATS and All Rise is what I used to take care of them.
---
I've since gone back a couple times and they acted normally.  Oh, Bethesda, you never change.
---
Bullshit
---
Could you do a a Cans map? Aluminum, Tin, Chimes?
---
Ah but there is alas the classic bit of palaeontology thrown into the archaeology to keep the public perception they are the same thing! /s
---
Thanks for making this list of locations. I just finished this challenge by retracing the BOS questline. This will make it less of a grind for others.
---
The best weapons are no longer tse they are:
---
For PVE:
---
Bloodied Explosive for semi auto
---
Bloodied 25% Fire rate for automatics
---
Bloodied 40% swing speed for melee
---
For PVP:
---
Anti-Armor explosive or 25% fire rate
---
Also since TSEs are not the best now you can use VATS builds with bloodied weapons for extremely OP results combined with Unyielding Sentinel armor to have insane stats and invincibility
---
Base damage at 100 or so. 
---
+60% adrenaline, 
---
+50% adrenal reaction, 
---
+250% during daylight or +350% at night
---
I’m not sure how it stacks in but the numbers are high normally. 
---
Prime receivers, commando, expert commando and master commando all at +3
---
The explosive handmade is at 126 base
---
The instigating handmade is at 96 base
---
Fixer is at 98 base damage
---
Truthfully, I was too busy helping settlements or avoiding Preston to get to know any of them. :D
---
That I could agree to much better.
---
Based on how Grindy it is, I feel like the lead lined mod should give as much rad resist as a hazmat.
---
I mean the event completion loot - plans/recipes/etc.
---
Solid piece of advice! Thank you!
---
All of my armor i start with "AR" so they are grouped together. Then name them whatever after that.
---
Atom shop will get a new inventory but other than that, no
---
I expect the 4-5 star items will come out when we get more content like the "High Level Vault Raids"
---
I guess my question is which would produce consistent vats crits faster assuming I have a weapon with 25% reduced vats cost, crit savvy or four leaf clover.
---
Same here. Going in my ps4 setting and trying to fix it doesn’t seem to do anything.
---
Throwing a railway spike seems like it should have recoil.
---
Electrically pushing a ball of plasma or a laser beam seems like it should probably have the same recoil that the handmade has (that is, almost none....). :)
---
Agreed.  I saw nothing of the sort.  They did suggest if anyone had survival materials they didn't need they donate it to those who did need it, but they didn't mandate it be taken from someone and given to someone else.  Altruism would be a more accurate 'ism' for them.
---
Considering communism has always failed and people always die and suffer, probably not.
---
Armor plate is +91 damage resist and only 30 carry weight
---
Lead lined is +91 rad resist and only 30 carry weight 
---
Insulated is +91 energy resist and only 30 carry weight 
---
The carry weight one is 120 weight but -60 energy and -60 rad resist
---
I renamed my PA frames to reflect what armor sets they're rocking, but I hadn't considered doing the same for my, admittedly pretty shitty, regular armor. Good pointer; thanks!
---
Yes. Inert flux, raw meat. Randomly on PC. No rhyme or reason.
---
Have you gotten a lens mod to pop by scrapping?
---
It happens to me as well. Last time yesterday. The item is activated and the game freezes without the item being consumed. It got the point where I would sometimes hotkey a consumable, just to be on the safe side 😪
---
On what grounds are you calling bs? Or are you just trolling?
---
Well, a mailbox is coming.  I gotta think that means mail is coming too in some manner.
---
Swing Speed on a weapon like that is highly desirable. Don't know if it would go for 10k, but definitely more than 2k!
---
One probability is that people are testing the market.  A vast majority of players don't use reeddit.
---
I know I price my items to see what the demand is a simple economic tactic in sales.
---
Platform? If PC then this game consumes a lot of RAM and also need write a lot of information on the drive. Run the game on a SSD and use the Windows's page file system to increase you space on RAM. Reducing the quality of graphics and the distance of drawing can help a lot.
---
A console normally don't have this issues because they are optimized. On PC the user need optimize. Bethesda need improve on this seriously.
---
Don’t worry terribly much about what cards you unlock, get a base point system down and experiment. Once you get around 140ish you will have a pretty good build with unlocked cards and the basic SPECIAL points. Passing 150 you’re going to have so many unused levels adding up. You can either move the points for new builds or just keep taking random cards. I’m level 210 and my SPECIAL points are set up pretty decent where I can play almost any build with good damage.
---
Just need more Pipers' to plaster the towns wall with the truth before the raiders come.
---
t-minus 12 minutes I think
---
I'm giggling like a little girl for pale rider
---
Well I read it on a similar post here about the campfire event. I just did a little research and couldn’t find anything definitive. But in my experience it helped... maybe just coincidence
---
12 minutes until the horsemen armor drops off, so then?
---
If they add this you just know it will ignore super duper, tis the 76 way.
---
Passive mode should be on automatically for everyone during events
---
I'm on PS4. It happens quite often
---
well im on ps4 pro and most of the time i have to look on the floor since the subtitle blend with the background (ear problem)
---
Combat Knife. They do take a little getting into though. ;)
---
I modded a 3\* walking cane and it became a 4\* last week
---
I put a dash in front of the stuff I name. It pushes everything to the top of the list and greatly improved visibility and organization.
---
Im over level 200 and ive had level 50 dudes just come in and one shot the boss without letting me get a hit. If im alone ill one or two shot the boss, if there is other ppl i always tag. I usually hit em with the 'what the fuck are you doing' question emote when they kill it quick.
---
Ohhh. Thanks, will check that out tomorrow and update the list. Thank-you for the input.
---
I'm just hoping for a backpack that goes with my longcoat
---
Price probably. Most people here seem to agree they should br 500c or less.
---
If i still played melee i would give 20k in a heartbeat.
---
It isn't fun. Ash Heap quests for lode bearing, mother lode, or even running around in Excavator in the various mines is probably best.
---
You can sit on extractors at workshops, but Silver doesn't produce ore - you get scrap from the extractor so.... Actually mining is the way to do it. :\
---
Cool, not necessarily pointing at you there, just making the point.

I always try to get a hit on the end boss (lots of useful stuff even if the legendary is 120 levels below me), but I'm also just farming event loot and badges now, so the only time I go to town is if there's only 1 or so low levels with me, and only then after I'm sure they've some damage.  Then I open up with my handmade and get the job done.  If it's a bigger group, even all 50+, I put a .45 into the boss and then either clean up small mobs or sit on my hands.
---
Nope. It was in the same patch notes as the white knight nerf.
---
‘Toggle unlockable” doesn’t seem to do anything on my weapon workbench but when I use it on the armour bench it shows atom shop outfits that are greyed out and locked because I haven’t bought them. This was how folk found out the reward for collecting all the deathclaw eggs was the Easter bunny head so I do check occasionally to see if that button brings up anything interesting lol
---
Exactly so, it reminded me a lot of the "give back to the community" initiatives a lot of Sheriff's Offices and Police Departments do.
---
They are 500c. :P
---
Someone in another thread said they expected 350. Hm.
---
Yup, or maybe the "science" perks.
---
That sounds cool! Man, I can never get them to snap to a roof piece. I can only get them to snap to the bottom triangle piece, thus making it pointless cause I would just use a normal half wall if that is what I wanted.
---
No update planned afaik, they'll just activate it on the 16th. Not today.
---
People , regardless of level, need to realize what the objective of quests really are.   
---
It's really tiresome to see people forget about feeding the campfire kindling because they're preoccupied with goddamn bugs...Or attacking the sheepsquatch instead of protecting the brahmin...
---
All the times I've done the Fasnacht event I never once saw the megasloth go down with one shot, and I definitely saw plenty of explosive rounds going off.
---
Plenty of tent and s'more plans. It took me about 3 and half hour to get 8 badges. Still faster than than challneges.
---
I want that sweet backpack with a cute baby Mothman 😍
---
I was thinking that but I think giving the option to the player of individually crafting and getting the super duper to proc or bulk craft and no chance of proc is better than nothing.
---
Personally I have Super Duper L3 but sometimes I just haven’t got the patience and don’t mind about getting that double craft sometimes.
---
I've been close to mac caps for so long i'm reallly enjoying the new player vending just to buy cheap crap legendaries to turn to scrip. Be interesting to see if peeps will still sell 2-3\* garbage for a few hundred caps after the vendor goes live.
---
It just takes patience. I've been looking for a tameable deathclaw for a very long time now, and just yesterday is the first time I ever found one. Just keep server hopping, you'll get a tameable one eventually
---
Mines been doing it too, thought it might be the controller but it's fairly new.
---
If are in any way into min/maxing and being as effective as possible, then the magazines add value.  A 1 in 5 chance in damage avoidance is better than 0 in 5 chance of damage avoidance. Period. 
---
If you want to continue to avoid them, then by all means continue to avoid picking them up or throwing them in your shop for the minuscule amount you think they are worth and i will continue to buy them and enjoy the benefits they offer.
---
You're more than welcome.
---
Same ! ! !
---
Yeah, just tamed one a day ago.
---
Ye
---
Ii have q paralyser flamer with about 20 k flame fuel.
---
Psst.  Maybe they don't expect borderline OCD completionists to complete all of them every single day for maximum Atoms...
---
Literaly 5 topics down same question
---
I gave away like 5 1* for just like 50-100 caps just crappy weapons but decent lvl.
---
Refrigrator +60% slower spoiling (dont stack with perks) and only 30carry weight
---
Sadly idk if we will get that, it was not in the last datamine
---
I do the same with a +
---
Magnifying glass can also be found inside one of The whitespring shops, across the hall from Artisan's Corner (the shop with all the crafting benches).
---
Easy to find enough bones behind Whitespring, in the dumpster area where the Mr Handy is sweeping, next to the bunker service entrance. No combat required.
---
Remember to check player vendors, I've found several selling maps for fairly cheap.
---
How old it is? I would think the HDD is having age problems. Of course, the game need a lot of optimization in all the platforms. A console user don't must've to check his hardware frequently just for a game.
---
Killed it! 😄
---
Oh yes, I'm hoping so. Congrats on finishing off the challenge.
---
The green looks awesome with my camo combat armour but other options would to match outfits be great!
---
ok.
---
Now all you need is a little dog. Looks great
---
That's most likely
---
My biggest concern with the current system is that we cannot break up merged cards. 
---
This is a major flaw imo wich makes it impossible to adapt the perks to their full potential. 
---
Learning how to choose the right build is hard and we learn as we go along how we want to play and build our SPECIAL's.
---
That's the truth.. Man.
---
You wanna sell any of those smores or tent plans :)
---
nope, can hand it to anyone, they learn it on pickup. and can give it right back.
---
Yea I should hotkey stuff but for some reason I never use hotkeys lol
---
&gt;bam ba lam
---
Whoa black betty?
---
It's in your "camp build". Under floor plans.
---
Good tip!
---
Well it's pretty old. But i've never really had problems with the console so far
---
I'm not a fan of the current system. Feels like I'm being punished for actually leveling up a character from scratch just because I'm doing quests. And once you're on the leaderboard, the only way to get off is to die, so you either survive as long as you can, or you suicide. 
---
IMO any game mechanic that encourages or 'rewards' players to kill themselves is badly designed. 
---
It also feels awful for anyone trying to sell shit on survival, which is already enough of a challenge with the brain dead turret AI and trap bases. The second I'm on the leaderboard, one guy can tag me while his team travels to and levels my base for no reason other than griefing. So I can either run back, hope to get my turrets back on, and then hope they do any damage before getting wrecked, leave the server, or let them lay waste to shit. 
---
Survival is still in beta, so I'll cut them some slack, but this mode definitely needs some changes before it's ready.
---
Paddleball for eyeball pleasing fun
---
For me it's doing it on those and stimpacks and spoiled stuff.  
---
A friend had the issue but it fixed it for them on the last patch. Not sure why it's still happening
---
Lol Thanks.
---
There is a dark gray one with a canteen, shovel, and flashlight in the last datamine that I think would work perfectly.
---
I also want the nukashine cooler for reasons
---
Technical term is a valley. But yes, we really need those.
---
I agree, I come from the YouTube channel. Even tho I’m on Xbox I still want some PvP. So instead they focus on nerfing a bunch of stuff then actually fixing the bugs in the game. It’s time to stop food builds from what they always get. I’m tired of seeing all the tears from the food builds, lets stop them. 
---
And also........The Devil Is here
---
Lure a mutant hound into the pic.
---
I'm not looking for raiders, I just think its stupid that people can have invincible turrets in survival.
---
I would choose Crit Savvy since there is no guess work and no random chance involved. Otherwise, you could expend your entire AP bar and not proc Four Leaf Clover. Additionally, in PvP, try to pair Crit Savvy with a weapon that has the +15% Faster Critical legendary effect. Depending upon the weapon, you may find yourself hitting a Crit every other shot.
---
Good idea lol
---
Good drop! That's worth sticking in your vending machines. Or even using it.
---
What perk cards do you have on?
---
Ooh.. not seen those yet. Will google (other search engines are available 😂) it now!
---
Do it with the dog by Harpers Ferry!
---
I'm fucking vibrating in anticipation.
---
Search some more in the Emote section of the Atomic Shop.
---
Chill down
---
Thanks for downvote, thar helped so much. Wow. My life is better now....
---
I don't see why shooting enemies on film is not as fun for some people as shooting enemies with guns.  Unless it's a legendary, I've already been there, done that.  It's part of the everyday grind.  In my opinion, the camera challenges are fresh and new and I hope they release more.  I think it also has room for adding more challenge, like taking pictures while remaining undetected.
---
If you want to minmax you gotta have character thats reliable and that does the same thing exactly the same every time. The more variables, the more random bonuses, the less control you have over your character, because you get wrong impression about how fast will you kill or how long can you sustain fire. Everything thats unreliable has no place in minmaxing reality, its a noise, misinformation. This is how I see bobbleheads and magazines. Unreliable misinformation about what my character can and what he cannot do. Change suggested from OP changes these consumables from time-wasting trap for lower levels into another field to customise your character, another interesting tweak. Its infonitely more cool that current system.
---
I wear the engineer outfit and can confirm that the backpack indeed shows with this outfit. Minor amount of clipping at the top with the tank.
---
U mad, bro?
---
It only happens at night
---
Due to insanely overwhelming player requests, in patch 9 they made every item/creature/item/location the same shade of black. 
---
So FO76 is now like playing a text based game, only without the noob crutch of having text. Just a player screaming, scorchbeast screaming, ghoul screaming, blackout death orgy, as you try to sprint from unseen event, to unseen location. I'm pretty sure they like, quadrupled the number of fissures, because I have spent the last 25+ hours of gameplay doing nothing but falling into one. 
---
The best part is not really knowing if you actually still have your weapon equipped, if you still have ammo, or if you still even have clothes on. I have to say it's made survival mode really stand out (or at least I think it has? I don't really know which one I'm in anymore).
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our mime and shadow puppet role playing group. We meet every Tuesday at the nearest fissure, or at least everyone says that's where we meet, I haven't been able to confirm.
---
Spoken like a true Raider!

---
Thought I'd save you some time
---
Hahaha xD. Im jealous anyway, as Ive yet to see it, only killed fake robot one from event.
---
Know if its a random encounter? is it a part of the brahmin quest that spawns somewhere?
---
Is it soloable, unlike the robot one?
---
I am completly chilly, so now, does someone know, how to trigger thar event? Serverhoping at place where it happens don't work.
---
You don't need to, that's the point.
---
where is your camp? i want cats...
---
Have you tried the "repair all" function from the CAMP unit?
---
Hell, yeah.
---
You don’t trigger it. It triggers you.
---
I second this. Not impaired, I just ware some glasses for far away, but nothing major. I sometimes can't read the menus, notes etc, and then I skip them because I can do without them quest-wise, but I do miss out on the content and that's a shame. This game is very playable without all the notes and letters, but it would be awesome WITH them. Thnx Beth, if you're gonna fix this! A simple solution would be to just raise the contrast.
---
I thankfully, or at least to my knowledge since I didn't catalog everything, didn't lose any Legendary items in the "Missing Items" plague that struck so many players... but I did lose the Left leg of my T-60 PA. Granted, it could've been somehow lost in a sale to a Vendor Bot, but I usually would've been wearing my Excavator at a vendor since I'd have been in need of its extra carry capacity. *(I chalked it up to Karma as a day prior someone posted a pic they had taken in a Rad Storm and I brought to light the comedic fact he was missing the R-Leg on his PA... lol)*
---
That being said, there may indeed be something to that. Where items are lost because of a database hiccup where there's not an additional flag set. So when an inventory item vanishes, the database is just "Inventory: &lt;list of items&gt;". 
---
Whereas with mutations *(and again, this is speculation)*, there's "Is Mutated: Yes", "Mutations Count: 3", "Mutations: A, E, M". 
---
\*cue database hiccup\* 
---
[Kovac-Muldoon voice] "ERROR-ERROR: MUTATION 'A' UNKNOWN. PLAYER MUTATIONS COUNT: 3 - INITIATING CONTINGENCY PLAN - APPLY MUTATION **B**. CRISIS AVERTED, HAVE A NICE DAY." [/Kovac-Muldoon voice]
---
But yea... in the case of our inventory, there's nothing to "compare against" that you even HAD something in your inventory, so whatever is 'left' it assumes is correct, just 'shrugs' at you and everyone continues to pretend "It Just Work™! :D"... :( heh
---
U can take photo at me at rose, i will be naked tho, because i have no fucking interest in getting some raider paper trash armor for some stupid "challenge" how is that challenging?
---
It should have now, all they added was an existing bed on sale, it's like they don't even want money.
---
Is that new? I don't think I've done the One Violent Shit event. Does it start in a porta toilet?
---
We all have endless food and water supply now! XD
---
Thanks, atleast you try to help. I was on three servers where were night, but event wont start when i run inside of that houss, do you know where is triggering place?
---
Think thats why they removed it, since u could make Another star to earn more script
---
Nice
---
Yeah but there's in-game evidence of creepy haunted mannequins pre-war. There is an instance of a synth posing as a mannequin though
---
i made sure to pass mine around before that happened.
---
Sharing the love with someone who has completed 14 campfire tales and got 0 badges from it.

Yeah, and you have to push vendigo thru your @$$hole. It is kinda pain, thats why i am so mad

There are, like, thirty Ray's Pizzas. They all claim to be the original. But the real one's on 11th."
---
Brilliant! Many thanks!
---
I need to do it, because i want that fancy dress and you know i am broke!
---
Yea im scared to drink boiled water now
---
Flex?
---
Most melee weapon with instigating is highly effective, add the right perks you can one shot most enemies with them. Plus swing and endurance it’s god roll. 40 scrip is too cheap, save that for your junkie’s pipegun with extra bashing.
---
Leader of the pack event. Most of the time you get them on free range event also.
---
YEPPERS!
---
I believe if you go to the Farris wheel there is an event there that spawns a bunch
---
Old thread and late to the party. Is it a skin or a whole different weapon. Like the BOS sniper rifle and hunting rifle.
---
I've been trying to get leader of the pack, but it hasn't been showing up. I'll keep an eye out for Free Range too. Thanks
---
I got mine for 3k. Think it depends on the console. I use the market here on Reddit.
---
Just keep your ears open when the sons of dane broadcasts comes over your pipboy it on. It is one of the few events that has server  wide notification
---
It's the best update imo. I've ran into all kinds of buyers, burned up a few guys (not kids) who yell in the mic. One guy yelled he was going to report me but he was in his 20's at least. I didn't catch the rant (was on team audio) but my buddy said it was bad. Said college kid because he was using big words and had the iq of a dog xD. You don't even need a bait bag anymore.
---
I dunno how much I've sold exactly but it's over 40k, more towards 50. The easy sales are marsupial serums and the old fach event plans (surprised biv plans sell well too). Lead and steel sell right away. You have to adjust prices a lot to get players to bite. Sold a lot of outfits from the brotherhood cache. Some 3 star weapons but on the cheap, had to be in camp so players could see the stats :| Give away magazines like promotional.
---
Great thing is it allows you to farm/events and make money. The 10% isn't a issue as it saves time. The one thing you pretty much have to have is another account. I couldn't do it without dumping the caps onto those characters. 25k comes up fast sometimes when you get a buyer who wants everything. If you go over, the caps don't rollover, they're gone.
---
tldr; Best update hands down. The grindy backpacks and mods are something I liked too.
---
Uncanny Caverns
---
Everybody else too. Enjoy the weapon!
---
If you do leader of the pack it may be smart to kill one of the wolves with a knife to check that one off too
---
They both make sense. You can see how they arrive; the issue I have is that the minute men failed to really feel like minute men before modding.  They were like non-existent until you fired a flare.  They didn't have a base, wouldn't be in settlements, and would rarely patrol.  The responders at least seem to be entrenched in the world, they're just all dead.  They have more personality because their better fleshed out, even though they're wiped out.
---
Only if it had some sort of proximity mechanic. A very short distance. I don't think you should be able to sit in your camp and earn xp by being on a team.
---
Backpack with shovel on atom store now. Bought it already! 👍
---
I'm middle age and my eyesight keeps getting worse.    I've been playing video games all my life and don't plan on quitting.   It would be very helpful if gaming companies considered that not all their customers have 20/20 vision.
---
Thanks, you are the best wendigo i met.
---
If levels not scaled to player I'm gonna die
---
How much?
---
It does affect the explosive weapon ammo though: Rockets, mini nukes, and m79 grenades get reduced weight.
---
The new event isn't as big a deal, you can hop servers if you somehow manage to fail.  But for the sheepsquatch, and the imposter one, it's harder to find the event (and costly too), not to mention a lot *easier* to fail if people aren't paying attention.
---
I've seen a couple *seriously* overpowered people take out the sloth in a few seconds, long before most people could even get a hit in (including me, and I was focusing on getting one hit in before turning to the adds).  Totally inappropriate and thoughtless.
---
Hell, to your point, I was watching a streamer last night, doing the camp event with a few other people.  First, bragging about how OP his gear was, then hopped up on a roof screwing around and talking shit...as the event failed in the background.  People are often too self-absorbed to care about what other people are experiencing.
---
Where does he spawn at Whitesprings?
---
TAKE ALL MY ATOMS I'LL STEAL MORE LATER!!!! 
---
bone totems + warhawk where have you been all my life
---
prepare yourselves for a whole new level of sexy
---
Investigators cabin spawns them often
---
Its a unique weapon, but you can still modify it a bit.
---
&gt; I'm fucking vibrating in anticipation.
---
You should probably get that checked out
---
I've been listing ammo at 1 cap each and have mixed results. Someone bought all of my 45 and some of my shotgun shells, but no takers yet on the 308 or 2mm. Cheap plans sell as well. I generally only sell items i can't sell to the vendors, so let it go cheap.
---
I heard you can't have sequential crits anymore, so Crit Savvy should be significantly superior on DPM.
---
When I buy or sell items from the enclave bunker I have to position myself so my viewpoint is facing the darkest area of my screen. Those stupid terminals don't need a damn spotlight on them in the first place. It's a computer with its own light source.
---
I don't know why it would be a joke weapon. It has more mods than the Buzzblade which is a fundamentally more absurd weapon. They obviously put a ton of work into the design. 
---
Also I'm not sure what a joke weapon is. I've heard that used as an excuse for why this weapon wouldn't work but I never actually understood it. The Buzzblade works, there foundation is in place and with a minimum of effort the Chainsaw could be a fully functional, top of class weapon.
---
In the future!
---
Thanks for putting this together. There’s also a lvl 3 terminal outside of Poseidon Energy
---
Berkley springs on thursday
---
Great drop, def not a script.
---
2 days from now at Berkeley station, its not showing on the map yet
---
Message me on XBL, I will be on around 5pm CST
---
GT= Medieval Paul
---
Nope. This was "Signs &amp;... Somethin'Somethin'"
---
I'm a melee build, so if I need the power to finish off, I put on my super sledge. If I just want a hit that doesn't do too much damage so everyone can get a hit, my handmade is out. It's just good manners and a lot of people do the same, like you. It's the ones that come in partway and start one hitting everything after I've already been sharing hits eith others that just upsets me more than anything. I've left Uranium Fever for this exact reason. Is it really do hard to be considerate? I'm just glad that there seems to be more and more players with this one for all mindset.
---
I use ZZ = Type Effect
---
I also always put Leg Left instead of Left Leg so the legs are together and the arms together.
---
True that! Agreed!
---
Ty
---
Don't get me wrong... I **DO** agree that it would add a very interesting mechanic, and I won't lie that the exact same thing went through my head initially. I actually took a few minutes to decide whether or not this was any sort of 'intended' occurrence, as it'd certainly add a whole new mechanic to the game. Plus, it would make Serums far more valuable/necessary. 
---
Starched Genes could perhaps either be "re-written" at its current 2-rank capability, changing/appending to the end "...won't gain any new mutations; however, current mutations have a 5% chance to themselves mutate."
---
OR - That, but then also include a Rank 3 which then delivers the same functionality that current Rank 2 offers of no-mutations; period. 
---
Neverthelress, took the majority of the day yesterday to even come across a Player Vendor that was offering Adrenal Reaction, nevermind Marsupial. Once I did, despite the vastly higher pricing (1000 and 750, respectively), I just bought 'em.
---
*(Thankfully, business has been booming for my own vendor, to the point I reached max caps and had to power them down for a few hours! Also gave my friend another 5K heh)*
---
Preston was the only companion I never traveled with in 4. Nice guy, but way too reliant on me to be the Minutemen for him.
---
No idea what's fair. 500 each?
---
It sounds like OP is talking about vendor/trade screens that have that silly translucent yellow color.
---
Since the last datamine I've been super excited for a bunch of new atom shop stuff! Every week it's the same. Really disappointed with the selection of backpacks and camp items again. Where are the flowers? The Nuka Cola coolers and cacti? The only thing I like is the Mole Miner stash, but since nothing I wanted came out and it's not limited time I'll just wait to spend any money, again. Cool, there's new hairstyles but they all look the same and aren't interesting.
---
I appreciate this post,  but it's hard as fuck to read
---
There's a mighty global army of us in the dozens.
---
I think the best to do is let us save loadouts so he change on the fly.
---
This. But for every video game ever. I need bigger text too! I always find that the bigger screens make the game larger but sort of stretch it. Nothing ever seems actually bigger.
---
Is the raider stuff out already?
---
All the quest rewards can be recrafted up to level 45 (I don't know why they don't go all the way to 50).
---
Chill down. Of course this is a problem. But like problems IRL, just rant off doesn't help. The designers wanna create a community around the game (I know... ludicrous, bad design, a insult to the lone player, stupid forced things, etc).
---
The best option is joint a hub on your platform (Discord for example). Then participate on that and share information. The challenges are easy when a lot of people search the oddities. And when someone find out he can call all the community on that server.
---
This also have problems. For example PS4 players have problems with large list of friends, but find solutions is part of the fun of gaming. However, Bethesda really need find a better way to do it and clear the main issues.
---
Sounds like you are making a killing with the machines. I guess we are all going to run into rude people more often now in our camps.  One person replied about a player stabbing another one because they were taking too long at the machine and was using the camp to try and promote PVP I guess.  Glad you are enjoying it.
---
I'm sure some people during those events are rolling with Gun Fu as well...easy as hell to snap 5-6 in a matter of 2-3 seconds
---
Berkeley springs. If you run towards the station you can get there before it loads up so you will be inside and you can check out the shop.
---
It was before those modes even existed.
---
Bless you!
---
One place that's a guaranteed spot which I'll often suggest in chat if someone asks is this: 
---
If you have the hunterville fast travel unlocked go there. Now turn around--on the left hand side you'll see a graveyard with 3 wolves
---
Wolves live and hunt in groups called a pack. A pack can range from two wolves to as many as 20 wolves depending on such factors as habitat and food supply. Most packs have one breeding pair of wolves, called the alpha pair, who lead the hunt.
---
I have no clue what this is for yet but thank you!
---
I think swing speed gets listed above the stat box, so in this case it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Instigating tesla is probably sellable too, especially if the other stars are any good.
---
Oh damn. I didn’t know we’d loose carry weight with these. I better think on this. Thank you.
---
I tried dropping a camera and got the message it would be destroyed but maybe you can give the bucket list note to start the quest. If anyone tries that and it works please let me know
---
You can sometimes trigger it by fast traveling to the radio tower below the sons of Dane also The way events work is a new one pops up when an old one ends so finish a small one and then travel there and sometimes it works
---
*loads 50. Cal with patriotic intent*
---
Yea, Kaisers Curse
---
Serum aren't worth as much as it use to be,I can easily buy them for under 500 caps and mark them up at my base for 750.
---
"Leeching" implies that you believe everyone (or nearly everyone) knows exactly what to do, but deliberately chooses not to do it. No other possibilities exist.
---
What's it like having bifurcated, almost child-like world view?
---
There's a visual bug from what I hear when people buy part of your stack. It says they buy the whole thing when they don't.
---
Shutup and take my upvote!  That made my day, thanks for that mate.
---
In case of mobs at those events a good point. It was more what i want to get behind if there is something i missed to understand depending on event bosses.
---
I can read exactly half of the notes, because the rest is illegible.
---
Encounter a CTD with at least 200 pounds of junk on the ground within 100 feet of you - 20 atoms
---
Fail a scorched earth event with the queen not taking any damage for the last 15 minutes - 30 atoms
---
Fail an encryptid event with no pylons ever being picked up - 10 atoms
---
Finish a broken tadpole or possum challenge five times - 20 atoms
---
Sell 20 3* legendary items in your camp while you are on the other side of the map - 10 atoms
---
30 more items per machine
---
Did you look all around your wheel? The extra emotes have to be selected before you can use them--they replace the default ones (i.e. if you had the tricentennial salute, it would be in a mini menu when you select the hello emote on the wheel)
---
isnt there one skirt and one shorts?
---
Yeah well I don’t wanna start that “fuck-you, no fuck you” death log haha. But true
---
Mutants, Ghouls and Yao Guai, oh my!!
---
Looks like we’re getting closer to those faction atomic shop items. Starting with Raider and mole miner, datamined showed some fire breather stuff around the corner. Just want my BoS stuff now.
---
Some people have more than 30 things they wanna sell and have up to 120. I personally have 60 3* weapons. Maybe I could scrounge up some armors too
---
Np and for people who dont like to play low health builds TSE and Anti Armor are the way to go
---
You get 30 slots per machine, and can build 4 of them in your camp. That's the only practical benefit other then keeping things organized for easy shopping for your patrons.
---
I’m solo af haha
---
I use [ brackets to push all my gear to the bottom of the list. 
---
A 3 star Unyielding AP Refresh weapon weight combat left leg would be: [A][LL][U](AP){WW} Combat. 
---
A 3 star Anti armor explosion 90% reduced weight gatling gun would be [5mm][AA](E){RW} Gatling
---
Yep. For me I split my items into different machines. One for weapon, armor, chems/clothing/plans, and one for ammo/mods.
---
Berkeley springs look where the train rail ends on the map
---
On PC, still happens from time to time. It's any consumable - usually I crash from eating food or flux to heal, but I once had a crash from trying to learn a plan. Seems like it only happens from the pip boy though, I do a lot of healing through dog food and nuka cherries on my favorites bar and that never caused a crash yet
---
A little formatting would go a long way...
---
Yes. I had hoarded several sacrifical mods and ended up selling them instead since they no longer add the star.
---
I'll do that
---
Organization as well. Put armor &amp; weapons in one, junk &amp; notes in another etc
---
Let him have his moment
---
Using three levels for the cards is definitely worth it imo, no matter the weapon.
---
This is like 7k

Nice. Thanks
---
ahah Glad to have been of service! :P "Teh Moar U Noe! ∼≈**✰**"

Why not just use the original screenshot?

Tadpole vendor says skirt or shorts, possum vendor says shorts or uniform (I feel like I already knew it was a skirt by the process of elimination but I was expecting a spiffy scout uniform to be unrealistically optimistic) lol
---
New hairstyles! :D
---
I hope it’s like when you craft stuff, you get to choose the level of the legendary. That way you can always choose a legendary for the character you’re building.
---
I have not. Didn't know that was a thing. Lol
---
oh well thanks for the head up guess ill be a Drag-Scout aswell.

Me and the billion of guys who bought that laser think like me. I can insta shot anything. Noobs like you especially.

Yesterday was my second day playing. I set up a Camp near the Morgantown Airport. Out of nowhere, a level 50 Mr Gutsy came into my camp. Pretty sure I died like 5 times, but I finally got him. Asshole destroyed all of my turrets and plants though.
---
It would be cool if the Atom shop had it's own Twitter page, so we can see the items. :)
---
120 slots vs 30, is the primary benefit.
---
You can also split them into category for faster/easier browsing, ie: armor / weapons / plans.
---
We did locked personal terminals in sets of 3 at a camp.  Just put them in a locked room so your buddy doesn't get murdered by a random passerby.
---
It often happens to me whenever I try to drink purified water.

Head to Big Maw and jump into the shallow puddle from the top.

Kill 2 birds with one stone
---
30 items per machine.
---
Plus... multiple vendors allows for a variety of uses. I have another post on how I use mine in my CAMPs.
---
Really? Sorry, I apologize for my comment. I genuinely assumed everyone was just swimming in lock picks.
---
I have 3 perception (mainly for the glowing one damage bonus perk) and I rarely dip below 99 picks. And, that’s with me selling everything beyond 101 at shops. The rest is essentially my emergency caps stash.
---
Besides the initial meeting of the Minute Men, the regular settlements needing defending, and the final selection of a faction in F4 there really was no personality or development of them at all.  In fact, the constant annoying requests from Preston turned me off from them for the most part.
---
The Responders are SO much better, but I think mostly because they were developed by all the holotapes and developments of them as a faction.  I wish all the factions still existed in one form or another.  I personally hope that some Responders survived and have been in hiding somewhere all this time after they realized they couldn't beat the Scorched, and hope they return somehow.  But they probably won't.
---
There’s a whole list of things wrong with your source using a .com and you didnt provide any other articles to further back up your claim 1 arrival then a Reddit echo chamber post that’s beside the point buddy, arguments based off “hear say” are completely anecdotal and don’t hold any weight but good on ya for trying
---
There are some notes from parents around that seems to indicate this happened post war.
---
I see so you don't rely on them exclusivley. Thx for the feedback!
---
You are on Xbox? I should have asked lol.
---
I think they do expect that
---
Yeah man I have 20/20 vision and that shits still hard to see sometimes...the light just washes everything out.
---
I've recently started finding mannequins in the wild a lot more aswell, usually four of them surrounding a government aid drop, sometimes with small accesories like a potted plant. Creepy for sure.
---
It's tied to stash space, not camp budget even though that's what it says
---
Lol! Love it.
---
1st of all, no you cant. Refractor and full BoS makes it not as great as you think, and I have one too kiddo. Second, I think you're a but to young to be on reddit if you're going around calling people "noobs" and flexing that you are Sooo strong. Your parents should keep an eye on your internet usage, there are some pretty adult things on here.
---
I think they are intentionally not craftable to maintain the economy. Otherwise, it would be possible via super duper and chemist to make a huge profit from a few raw materials.
---
Custom as in users are uploading their own textures? Because combining built-in textures is SUPER simple to “share” with other players. Uploading your own is a different ballgame.
---
I’m not saying it’s impossible, I’m just saying it’s a much bigger thing to do.
---
What was the price you set on the ammo
---
This is cool As Hell!!!!
---
It's a bug, yes. Relog or rejoin the server.
---
Thanks! I just realized I forgot I found those notes. I just didn't had the chance to read em because I was trying to find the missing kid items and was panic searching

How much did you have it listed for? There is a 10% tax on the sales.
---
Ohh, awesome. Will check this out tomorrow, thanks for the information friend.
---
Just a guess here, but I think you need to have learned the first 2 linings and at least 1 Raider under-armor before you can learn/get the shielded lining drop off of Uranium Fever... it's worth having them anyway, besides that you CAN/MIGHT get it from doing the Raider Quest line given by Rose at the top of the world.
---
The atom shop might have the new atom shop items maybe
---
Indeed.
---
And that’s only when you try to sell something that isn’t already in your stash...
---
You're more than welcome. I hope it helped. :)
---
BoS for energy weapon? Isnt leather better noob?
---
Tax?
---
I agree that’s the case but still doesn’t explain why Psychotats aren’t a recipe.
---
May the RNG gods smile upon you!
---
It's the Apocalypse... wear what you want. Seems like gender norms wouldn't really apply, ya know?
---
I get a glowing Yao Guia. Between my TSE Gatling and my rocket turrets it doesn't stand a chance.  I'm covered up in springs and waste acid.
---
At first I was like duh its an ammo type for a weapon slot item... but then I realized that some people may not have found that as obvious. Good share. Can confirm, ammo smith and super duper save loads of mats for the film.
---
I noticed it with' high' price items had an 1500c tesla in my shop, someone bought it an I got only 900 caps a bit then 10%tax I my eyes
---
Not an exploit I believe, but a bug, they will have paid the price you set but for 1c items there seems to be a bug where instead of 90% to you and 10% tax it is reversed, 10% to you and 90% caps lost to the ether... I’ve not experienced it myself as such (not kept a close enough eye on sales) but was mentioned in the sub by others... maybe others can add more info..?

power the machines, if the screen does not glow, no one will know

Besides Ronnie Shaw there weren't any actual Minutemen to get to know, they were just pure cutnpaste wastelanders labelled as 'Minuteman'.
---
The historical tie in was neat but underdeveloped, easily the most boring faction out of any of the games. Not hating on 4 like I've learned to love that game a lot but I do have an intense dislike of the MM.
---
Hides don’t drop from the beasts themselves for some reason, but they are rare loot in some containers. I’ve found them in random boxes and tool chests; some people have reported (or suggested...) checking deathclaw nests, scorchbeasts nests/guano piles, and supermutant meat piles. I didn’t have much luck with the last two.
---
They are powered, all 4 of them have power and are lit up
---
Well...glad to made you smile a bit then? :)
---
In order to apear on map you should energize the vending machine.
---
I put a Z in front so everything is at the bottom so I can easily see my new stuff or quickly sell/scrap what I don't want and a capital Z is easy to spot when spamming the sell/scrap buttons so I stop b4 I lose them
---
that IS pretty expensive but hey it's not real money so who cares eh? most serums I see go in the 200-300 range.
---
My vending has not been going so well. I've probably priced things too high for such mediocre items.
---
take care out there!
---
Fix the fonts! It's barely readable to me because it meshes with the paper color.
---
Thx for the insight! Appreciate!
---
The accuracy of the marker is a good point. Turning it into a search area instead would help somewhat with the system we have now.
---
I am
---
did you turn them off and on again?
---
Bruuuhhhh. Thank you!
---
All these people in here calling you a duper clearly have no sense in running a business and haven't noticed all the rubes selling Two-Shot and Anti-Armor legendaries for cheap just to free up some stash space.  Like you said, once you have some good items, it's pretty easy to sustain a very profitable business.  I'm a solo player, only play one character, and run 4 vending machines in my camp about a third full with legendaries.  I've been making so many caps since the vending update that I bought a serum recipe yesterday from an NPC vendor because I was worried about hitting the cap limit.  And i've bought and resold various legendaries that others priced ridiculously low.  Really, the shadiest part of this is the possibility that those legendaries were unintentionally put on sale, so I usually stick around for a minute or two to see if the owner shows up.
---
Very helpful thanks for the tip :)
---
&gt;I hope this makes your hacking life ... a little easier.
---
I couldn't help but read this in MODUS's voice. Thanks so much for this guide!
---
4 bone totems and three haircuts
---
And some other stuff
---
Demolition does work, it boosts the explosion's damage, however, not the bullet's
---
Ha! Nice try, you just want my stuff!
---
Does it use ultracite?
---
I hope they are. We need better content drops with more endgame additions.
---
I'M NOT YELLING THIS IS THE WAY THAT I TALK
---
Lol...add an f'ing 0 to the end of that number. Mole Miner gauntlet are a popular and this is a god roll.
---
I gotta be honest dude... your sad attempt at being a troll is coming off kind of pathetic.
---
First thing I done
---
I didn't think of this, but you're right - there's a lot of holotape/notes backstory to flesh them out. It also helps the world building was so well done, from the encampments in Morgantown to the Capitol. Their origin makes so much sense, too, organically growing from emergency services.
---
The minutemen always felt a bit arbitrary, if a group of people looking to help others were looking for an image/symbol, why use a long dead militia. Obvious, it was done bc Boston/colonial history, but it never made that much sense to me. However, the best part of the minutemen was the Castle, that I felt was well done.
---
Got a GF Gutotito? She won't mind investigating 😉

So, going back my original question, is anybody able to complete the leatherworkers badge requirements since finding these is so uncommon? I’ve completed all req’s for this badge, but this one still lingers. Thank you for responding btw.
---
Twice, in the first try. Missed it by a second. Second try was much better.
---
If you’ve spent any time on the market subreddits, these aren’t at all crazy prices there. It’s all about market reach though; it’s easier to hit those prices on the subreddits because 10,000 people at once can see your stuff and the people who want it and can afford it will buy it. It’s MUCH harder to reach the full market in-game. 
---
Someone was selling 2-3 star items for 30-150 caps in their camp. I make 3k+ caps a day just from vendoring to robots. If I see those prices I’m buying them just for legendary scrip. 
---
Supply and demand works both ways.
---
Its a 20-30k weapon. It's a god roll. Could also trade it for a nice god roll rifle or minigun.
---
This happened to me... I logged in one day and noticed my vending icon had disappeared. My thought was that maybe something was destroyed at my camp supplying power, but nothing was. Whatever caused it, completely reset all four machines, and I had to reprice everything all over again.
---
How did someone trash your camp?
---
Wow I need to read through the comments better. I didn’t even know people were accusing me of duping. Lol. This is going to be an interesting journey.
---
Higher than the current lvl 22 wendigo, would be nice, too.

* Buy 2000 Atoms with real money - 10 Atoms  
---
* Acquire 3000 Atoms worth of stuff from the Atom Shop - 10 Atoms  
---
* Take a camera picture of a player who just bought 2000 Atoms - 10 Atoms
---
Ahh I see that’s kinda annoying
---
7s, Jack's and king's would be effective. But also getting the "optimal deck" could be throttled by drop rate.
---
are there any items you have for sale in your machines?
---
Considering the Responders were in full operation and had all their main characters (even if they're all dead) in 76 then probably. It's not really a fair comparison when the minutemen you see in fallout 4 are **literally** just in the first stages of reforming throughout the game.
---
And on top of that, there's some lore about the past minutemen in their prime that makes them sound pretty cool. And Preston himself is actually quite fleshed out, it's just nobody bothered to talk to him and find out his story because everyone makes memes about settlement quests.
---
shortsighted parasites, and when caught none had the balls to admit it, instead try to lie their asses out just like typical no class criminals. come to think of it if they had any balls they wouldn’t need a bunch of tse and one million caps to boost their self esteem in the first place.
---
Appreciate it!
---
Well... fuck. I know what I’m doing when get back in game.
---
Wow got 4 costumes and no head yet. Spent 30k-40k on recall card. I refuse to just buy one.
---
Incorrect, bloodied, swing speed and +1 strength is a god roll.
---
Thank you for my LIFE
---
Did the items get removed? I notice that even when powered up, you still aha to have at least one item for sale for it to show.
---
Im just trying to let you understand that lasers with good mods good perks and good rolls do not need any buff. But you just don’t listen.
---
Not as such. There are the beer ones, gas station sign and that's as much as I remember. I just use the neon tube letters which are expensive plans to buy but I love them so much and went halves on the cost with a friend so anytime he needs neon signs put up I do it for him.
---
That’s the last one I’m waiting on. It’s obviously completeable, as I’m at 2/5 now, but I’m sure as help not grinding for it, I’m just going to let it come naturally. If you just want to grind badges, do the camp tales event every in-game night, and the two dailies.
---
Better yet how about a log in the Pip boy that provides a written transcript to look at for quests and rewards so when rewards are spammed in 5 seconds and you miss it you can get back to the log instead of going through your inventory to figure out what's new.
---
You can buy serum recipes from the Enclave vendor at Whitesprongs and I think it's also a rare reward from the Scorchbeast Queen event
---
There was plenty of time. Didnt rush it and didnt fall.
---
Please don't listen to these people. That is a god roll weapon. It does not get better. Mole mine gauntlet is a popular weapon base similar to meat hooks in builds. Instigating swing speed is one of the 2 top combos. The other being bloodied swing speed. Endurance is equally popular with Str as a tertiary. The weapon is 25k+ weapon or could be traded for what ever you want instead.
---
I didn’t mean to be mean, I was just making sure, I apologize if it may seem to you that I was being disrespectful, however I can say with confidence I was just staying safe. I didn’t demand if it was duped, I simply asked and he denied it, no one got upset so I don’t see a problem with it.
---
You can only damage a player's base in survival if you're in active PvP with them. If they aren't at the base, you might as well keep moving.
---
Wow that’s pretty good! The tin man got a real upgrade.
---
Bloodied at the moment.  Lots of synergistic perks and adrenal mutation.
---
Melee still very synergistic but a bit tougher to manage the low health build.
---
Demolition expert no longer mandatory for Max damage unless you need the int points.  Works out to 4% damage a point so the specific weapon pump actually higher (10% then 5% per point).
---
Stealth vats is not bad, but slower.
---
Yeah I had to screen shot them to open up out of game to mess with zoom, and contrast
---
No doubt. I don’t have access at work that I know of. Hence the question. Thanks though!
---
This is a very good point. I have never crashed from a favorites wheel consumable, only pipboy.
---
Upvote if you like the guide.
---
What Platform?
---
I will give you 3500 caps if it's on Xbox, or trade you some other nice weapon, I'm collecting 3\* Instigating weapons &amp; want it for my collection.
---
CaptJohnHWatson About to go to the movies, but I'll be on later. Can't wait to see your place!
---
He's at work
---
No one is saying that there is no such thing as a God roll energy weapon that is good if you have a build for it. The problem is that in comparison to ballistic and melee, energy weapons are generally weak
---
Only a single player can access a vendor at any time. Multiple vendors mean multiple people can shop at once. Plus it's nice to split everything up into categories.
---
Yup. Happened to me on xbox on the second day.
---
Spooky — what's up with the single Snaptail spawn way out West of Point Pleasant?? Like wayyy outside the playable area
---
There is more than one god roll for melee. What the fuck good is bloodied if an ISS weapon one hits the enemy. In some cases ISS is better than BSS. Same effect of one hitting without having to run low health. ISS is more saught after in pvp as well.
---
Just like alcohol and Biv.  Wonder if we will have scrap legendaries next.
---
lol. Thats where i was going with the take a pic of you and your friend in Black Rider Power Armor skin bs lol.
---
I have to sit close to the TV when wearing Weightless armor with chameleon
---
It triggers automatically. I always get a notification for it.
---
Oh cool. So you found two already. Did you find those since the quest or before?? Like, sometimes it counts things we have in stash. Also, camp fires tales doesn’t count toward badges, does it?
---
I'm sorry I didn't realise he was your boyfriend
---
😂 You just showed how little you know about this game.... Instigating is absolutely useless in pvp because 99% of players have atleast 1 rad. Meaning instigating won't activate.
---
...you have no idea what you're talking about do you?
---
Just invited you
---
I'm not far off myself, I'll definitely have 1000 by the type the Purveyor comes on line. Based on one of the images from the [Inside the Valult](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor) article, we'll be able to get 3-star legendary weapons for around 100 scrip - so each week should give us 10 chances to get at least one decent weapon. If they are all terrible, at least we can recycle them back for around 400 script.
---
I always see one north of Hemlock Holes, one by the Charleston area, and one in the sunken area by Poseidon Energy.
---
Is the skull mask the same as the Halloween mask or different? I am not able to log in at the moment. Looking forward to seeing everything this evening though.
---
You had to close the game?  You people are such special snowflakes.
---
Is it nighttime when you found it?
---
So.. I shouldn't make a laser shotgun. Damn.
---
1 time
---
Thank you for realizing it! 😘
---
Yes I had to close the game.. It's called taking a break princess
---
Yes, Grenadier absolutely affects Explosive Shotguns, Rifles, Pistols, &amp; Energy weapons, and it's easy to see when dealing with mobs, shoot 1 and kill several if they are in close proximity.
---
One word: immersion
---
The first three items are pretty easy to accomplish, so you didn’t even notice them.
---
You may have remembered it wrong, that combinations of effects isn't possible.  40% SS is a Tier 2 effect, higher power attack damage is also Tier 2, DR while power attacking is Tier 3 and you can't have more than one effect from each tier.
---
If the primary effect was Bloodied, Instigating, or maybe Vampire's, then yes you should have bought it.  If not, no since +SS weapons aren't that uncommon.
---
No, they're static spawns and always there unless someone has killed them already.
---
Alright I’ll try there. Thanks
---
okay...
---
He literally states that in the text of his post but you're so dead set on being an asshole that you didn't read it or just don't care.
---
I do the same, but with armor sets, I put a 1 or a 2 or 3.  So my troubleshooter suit will look like "2 TS RA", or Troubleshooter right arm.
---
The benefits of the magazines and bobbleheads last for long enough to make it through any event. If you consistently search for and pick them up and buy them from other players, then you will consistently have a bonus.  At that point you could consider it part of your build.  It's a lot less random at that point than knowing how the battles going to go based on all the other people you can't control jumping into the fight. 
---
The bonuses they grant, if permanent, would be too strong.  A 20% bonus to melee is the same as having both Gladiator and/or Slugger cards equipped as 3*, and it stacks on top of the bonus of Normal/Expert/Master - as well as any other perks like Bloody Mess.  As it is, most people can 1-shot, at worst 2-shot most enemies.  You don't *need* the bonus from the bobbleheads/magazines during your normal activities (shoot, you don't need them really for SBQ or Cryptid)
---
It's no different than any other MMO where players buy their potions pop them off before a raid boss.  It's been years, but in games like Evequest or World of Warcraft, you were expected to have your specific potions/food before you jumped into a raid fight.  That was part of your expected stats as of your character.  I see it as the same thing here.  You don't walk into a nuke zone without ample radiation protection - you could also say you shouldn't walk into a nuke zone to fight the SBQ without Grognak the Barbarian #5 because that will give you an additional 15% damage on top of everything else you already had against the scorched there.  
---
And like I replied to another person, I'm not opposed to having new ways to customize our characters - the backpack was a neat way to give additional carry capacity, damage resistance, or even a perk-free version of "good with salt", it's just people are way over simplifying the "just make bobbleheads or magazines permanent".
---
I like the idea of actually doing something to trigger an event, instead of just by being in the area.
---
Yeah... That's why I find my "winning" deck works so well... double (king) 10s and a 6, double (king) 8s and a 10. So few cards results in a good drop rate... and adding anything else to the deck just slows it down, and allows the opponent to start getting their jacks and jokers in.
---
Having a counter deck relies on having so many "counter" cards, that getting a winning hand becomes harder to do.
---
I'm within range of AWOL Armaments (just south of Robco) and I rarely get visitors, especially the last couple days. It seems like most players center around whitespring and the watoga area. I realize that's still in the bog as opposed to the mire, but it's pretty close either way.
---
Idk. It was all broken when I got there. Like 100% of it.
---
That build relied heavily on the fact that melee weapons did significantly more damage when over repaired. Now that that has been eliminated it's back to being mediocre at best.
---
This. People already do XP farming and carries. Yes, it would be \*slightly\* easier if group XP was a thing, but the gains outweigh the losses.
---
Wait isn’t that where the Grafton monster spawns?
---
Lol poor scarecrow got a major downgrade though.
---
I've already completed this, level 0 were the hardest to get for me. One I've used to complete level 0 ones is located in a house in "Landview Lighthouse". 
---
Still cheers!
---
I think that guy just came to wave his dick around, but I can't see anything. You got a microscope so we can find it maybe?
---
I've gotten quite a few visitors and sold half of my 90 item storefront. But I'm right by Thunder Mountain as well
---
An example of my renaming schema:

I’ve found one dweller on a roof at the megastop.
---
Are they connected to switches? There's a bug where switches will turn themselves off but still show green when you leave the area and come back
---
Oh shit, my bad. Read it wrong. Flatwoods is *much* harder to find and I don't know of any static spawns. My bad.
---
Beats me! There's a silt bean near it too
---
Nope. You've become the reluctant owner of two deer and two cats. You eventually make loving jokes about, "Oh, you do that again and I'll skin you! Haha!" You'll never admit it out loud, but these are four animals that will only get stuffed after a natural death.
---
Maybe your version. Mine looks as manly as manly can manly look manly.
---
It's a shame the conspiracy outfit released in the Atom shop today, would've been hilarious for the Tin Man!
---
Loving it though :D
---
Scrap 25 melee, armor, ranged... I can see it now
---
I blame that most of my playtime is through remote play, and I feel that the control sensitivity leaves something to be desired, since I often can find myself going through multiple picks on Rank 3 locks (usually no problem on rank 2 and never any on rank 1 or 0). 
---
I'm also old so I'm sure that has something to do with it as well, lol
---
That happened to me on sunday. I had to work and when I got home it still wouldn't show. I checked the machines and all the inventory went back in my stash somehow.  Maybe check that??
---
This would be amazing
---
I mean the game literally lists out exactly what to do. It has visual and audio cues, and massive giant bold text.
---
Well... we're gonna see if these things respawn I guess. *finger guns*
---
I havent run it yet but im setting the over at two...
---
You can put kings on your opponents cards. Use your kings to make them bust, Jack's if they try to do it back.
---
Yeah I think that person is confused. The Flatwoods Monster is a rare random encounter and not a static spawn. I've seen maybe 5 or 6 of them since the beta, mostly in the Savage Divide though I'm not sure if location matters or not.
---
You sir or mam, are a legend.
---
You can go to the bethesda website and they have a post on there that shows the items, that is updated every week.
---
Did you do this? If so it’s wonderful.
---
1800\* + two virgin sacrifices
---
I'm actually being sincere here. I can easily collect junk that will exceed my stash limit, but can't do much with it. So I just sell it for 1 cap each instead of just dumping it somewhere. I get like 2-3k extra caps per day from that and I know that someone who bought it can either use it for crafting/repairs or sell it to vendor for profit.
---
You can do that now.  Just find some like minded players who are interested in a roleplay and you can offer some rewards (maybe something you can craft or something) as a reward.
---
Iv heard it's a ui bug, as in your getting the money you should but the amount it reports back is false.
---
Haha! That would be perfect!
---
I do it with numbers instead as they come before letters in the list, and I just "00", so it's not only grouped together, but also all my pieces are at the top of the list.
---
Ive seen them 2 or 3 times on the rocks as you head down from Vault 76 towards the small ponds near the lumber mill there. This isn't guaranteed, but a possible spawn point.
---
You have to scrap them, and i sure wasn’t storing them. Yes, found them in tool chest and box.
---
And camp fire tales has a small chance (I’ve heard 10-25% of rewarding a possum badge. I’ve gotten 1 from the quests, I’m *pretty* sure it was the campfire.
---
Spawned at the end of brahmin quest/event for me. It was in Mire, kinda close to Watoga. Maybe just south of Harpers? Forget name of area.
---
I always see players by thunder mountain. I would love to move, honestly, but my camp location is 90% flat, with plenty of space. Plus I've got the lead deposit. It's hard to leave that
---
I don't think food/aid items stack with each other. They can stack with the other bonuses though (sleep, wise mothman, etc)
---
I've killed two, both only at night. One in the Savage Divide and one in the Mire.
---
Something like within 200 yards if on the same team would be perfect. 
---
I'm running around with a bowie knife shanking things so that my wife can get a couple hits in before I kill things lol
---
I heard running through the glass caverns is a good way to get them. I think there’s a change at grenade plans at the end.
---
I have been selling the plan for about 125 when i get it. 
---
Goes pretty quick. (PC)
---
Run East/West between R&amp;G station and Watoga along the tracks, and W/NW of Watoga. They're always around wooded areas for me, but the E/W run has spawned 4 for me so far, and the NW of Watoga has spawned 2.
---
When you fast travel to the Whitespring entrance (not the bunker or the train station), there's a red car just before you get to the building, just a few steps towards WS.  It will be on the hood of the car (assuing it's spawned at all).
---
Sadly, not without mods. I always had to use the concrete set as a 'basement' of sorts and have the main level on the second floor.
---
Your story will be told for years to come. Someone will record it on a holotape and it will get passed around until it's worn out. This is your legacy.
---
All joking aside, I'm super jealous. I just get wolves, super mutants, scorched, and feral ghouls at my camp. They are nowhere near as chill.
---
Oh right. SCRAP. Duh. Didn’t know that about camp fire tales. Thank you.
---
*"You cannot go that way"* 
---
Since you're the map guy, do you know if there's a map with an accurate outline of the playable area? That could be interesting.
---
As a self confessed junk hording addict, I'd love to sell some but it doesn't fit in my stash.
---
Think only the flamer counts as far as I know.
---
Bashing with the flamer counts, plasma rifle flamer mod doesn't count as I've tried that and it doesn't work
---
I did - I was told that it was under the same category as Trade.  I checked that but no luck.
---
As for the Atom Shop - I've looked through it one by one about five times and it's not even available for purchase let alone (Owned).
---
I guess I'll never understand why people think crying on reddit is okay but me making fun of them for it is unacceptable
---
I actually use everything I pick up. The only things I have a lot of are glass, rubber and plastic so I can mass craft marine tactical helmets to sell daily. Maybe I’ll sell them for 12 each so people can do the same without farming the junk themselves.
---
I already buy low level two shots etc to give to low levels.
---
There are little ones that say ammo, aid, armor, etc. I think its the metal sign plan but I'm not sure.
---
Yep, totally misread that. I've seen two since beta myself, not counting that one close to Flatwoods that disappears when you get too close.
---
That's right I forgot, thanks!
---
My favorite thing about these packs is that they only weigh 1 pound. Craft and carry 3-4 different modded packs to swap out as the situation warrants.
---
I'll try that.
---
How often can you do it? I've been away for a while and last I remember no one knew when/how plans refresh.
---
People that purposefully break the rules can and most likely will find themselves banned. Dupers are priority targets for sure.
---
I am making a comic book (with zip-o-tone) for one of my characters. I post them to the "Club" (Xbone) so my buddies can see them.
---
I came in here thinking you were talking about how they sometimes still stay laying on the ground as you kill them.
---
I did it with help with my friend Erin. Her work can be seen at erinmccomics.tumblr.com
---
I've had a similar issue with my camp. Some objects can not be selected again in their placement, so it sucks if i decided to delete said objects. I can still repair through the CAMP device, but yeah, bug with camp placement I guess.
---
I've also heard that it's reporting that you've sold X ammo, but X is really the amount of that ammo the buyer has in inventory after the sale.
---
Either or both should be easy enough to test with a friend.
---
Surprisingly, not once but, I fell off the obstacle course several times.
---
I lowkey just farm hoard events and other events and hop from westech to where AWOL armaments spawns and across like a 100 meters from AWOL area to I believe east
---
You don't find him. He finds you.   Sounds like you haven't found him yet and you should be grateful.   It's terrifying and you'd better not be playing solo when you encounter him.
---
Slaps forehead, forgot about searching the corpse when using butcher's bounty...
---
Or good at all 3 but heavy AF. (Aka basically power armor)
---
All of my weapons are W-##, all of my armor pieces are Y-##, and all of my power armors are Z-## (plus brief descriptions, obviously).  Then everything else I collect during a day's raiding gets renamed either "sell me" or "scrap me."
---
Aha that was what I thought at least, just wanted to make sure. Thanks
---
Have you bought the skull mask? If so, can you confirm whether or not you can wear hats with it on? Thank you in advance!
---
This actually would prove useful. I favorited my hazmat so that in case I decided to be a dumbass again and get out of my PA in a nuke zone, I can get in my hazmat and survive. This would be incredibly handy when it was time to get my armor back on.
---
Totally. And they’re super neat looking. I don’t like the atom shop skin though. The boxy one. Yikes. Lol
---
I wish my CAMP was darker inside... seems like any light source just bleeds into every other place inside, through walls, etc.
---
I want it dark, and dingy and freaky.  Hard to do when it looks like it's 3 in the afternoon all the time.
---
Who is crying?
---
He asked a simple question.
---
The quest was actually ended when you looked at the terminal, the fight is just a bonus and is not necessary for the quest.  When someone activates it everyone on the server will have a notification pop up that a "Rogue Encryptid is terrorizing Appalachia." That creates an event marker at the pylon ambush site that you can join.
---
You should be able to stack at least one food and one drink, but I have to admit I've never tried both cranberry types at once.
---
Don't you dare forget photos! Photograph another player scrapping a legendary. Bah! 🤣
---
Maybe a scorchbeast? Camps are immune to player damage now unless you're in pvp. I remember reading that a orbital strike can do it though, not sure how true that is.
---
Level 1, 2 and 3 terminals can be found at atlas observatory. Level 0 at Landview (Mothman) lighthouse
---
fallout shouldnt have a store..... for irl cash
---
Did the liberators tell you to do that?
---
No they wont... neither would the squeril (mispelled) stew
---
id love to have night vision goggles for my power armor, id replace the bright head lamp in a heart beat. make the eyes glow a dim green when active
---
You can auto a railway rifle...?
---
It's a shame we can't display the power armor sets, considering you can only wear 1 at a time.
---
I have an adrenal recipe up for 10k.  Seems like a reasonable price to me but no bites yet.  Have not seen too many in vendors.
---
Contact support, not Reddit. I'm sure they'll refund you the atoms.
---
That’s what a friend was recommending, and I have one of those.  But I’m trying to plan ahead for nuclear winter or situations where it’s 1 v many so I was considering the 25% reduced for sustained vats time. Ideally I’m shooting for 1 crit every 2-3 shots. And am trying to think of the best way since there is no more crit bank.
---
Well that's just sad... But hey at least I don't need to waste any more time farming badges, because the upgrades all suck.
---
Sounds like you hit the lottery. I want to move near kiddie corner for the snallygasters. So. Much. Acid.
---
My CAMP still gets a random tree that pops up in the middle of it, sometimes it goes away on its own.
---
Bulldozer feature needs to be better, actually level or grade the ground in an area your CAMP is located.
---
What I thought kingdom come deliverance did so well. I miss that game, haven't played in while.
---
Well the will probably change the photo ones to the scrap thing... still have to do the lvl up thing everyday still though... remember 3 out 5 of them has to be a chore not a challenge
---
I haven’t played the DLC for it yet, maybe I should give it a try again. The main story was amazing and god damn that game is under rated
---
Also Bethesda if you're reading this we need a colorblind mode. Or at least let us change our HUD color
---
Like the Mothman, you dont find the Flatwoods monster. It finds you. 
---
Usually when you least need it!
---
I've never seen another in a vending machine. I'll probably just offer then in the r/ markets to see get rid of them.
---
Wow. You've got a serious system bro!!!
---
There's a great overlook for the fallen space station by my camp north of the cemetery  I've taken some awesome photos of it during sunset.
---
You gotta hide it under a carpet to make sure people dont see it.
---
Lol if i finde a cat i will kill it and eat it this is something i have been doing since release 
---
food is food
---
You bought a skin, didn't you?
---
Yes it is. It’s tied to both. It only uses a small amount of budget but it adds up.
---
...that frequently glitch out and don't appear at all. I have yet to ever see them appear.
---
Then  again, my husband an I literally spent half the day yesterday jumping from one spawn location to another trying to find the camera corpse. Still haven't.
---
But yeah, everyone is a moron or lazy. Sure.
---
There won't be very packed. Think about how all new content locations are.
---
We got a really great high level enemy spawn up here. Wendigos, Grafton Monsters, Legendary Super Mutants, Sheepsquatchs, etc. 
---
Its pretty exciting really. Log in, walk down the road and heyo there's Mothman swooping down to give me a pamphlet on his religion.
---
It's a bad mechanic. I placed my camp on top of cliff so that whenever I got on the leaderboard, I could just jump off and reset. I'm not sure what the solution is, but when I've got an incentive to routinely commit suicide, it feels like poor design.
---
Did you buy skins for something you didn't already know how to craft? For example, the red stove that you need to already know the kitchen stove plan in game to use, or a backpack skin for a backpack you haven't completed the quest for yet?   
---
What it is you can't craft?
---
At the very least show up on teammates loading screens.
---
When i get too much steel ill sell for 0 caps. People usually buy other things because they’re thankful
---
is any part of this game without bugs or exploits?
---
I’m thinking in nuclear winter mobility is going to be super important (sprinting) and already have a full ap refresh armor set+ action boy and wanted to take advantage of the ap refresh.
---
Come to my shop in North, i sell most of my plans for 5-20 caps each (shameless plug!)
---
Good to know what but that is not what is happening here.
---
I hope so. It seems a previously fixed glitch was reopened with patch 9. I don't have faith that BGS would do it purposely as a honeypot, so it was most likely unintentional.
---
You need to add someone in the witch costume too!
---
I love both groups! But I really enjoy how fleshed out the the Responders are in this setting considering there's just the momentos left behind that we Vault Dwellers have to go by haha. It's neat!
---
I fell twice 😂. Cleared it on my second attempt though!
---
Same here! 😄
---
Yeah
---
Does the possum version look different than the tadpole version?
---
1 cap, but over 500 5mm was gone once the transaction was made.
---
This. Good for pve though.
---

---
Yeah, I'm curious to see what kind of 3 star weapons and armor the Purveyor dishes out.
---
Thanks for the comments guys. Much appreciated.
---
I mean it's pretty great, but 90% WR would be godly. those mole miner mitts are heavy AF
---
I'm sorry I couldn't personally hook you up. I may be the map guy, but in terms of data mining and understanding what's what in the game's databases - there are many others on this sub who could help more
---
The Pale Rider represents more than glitz and glamour.
---
when you equip a mutant's weapon the damage bonus is instantly applied to the pip boy menu. it also applies to any grenades you are using
---
If you are doing an Event like Uranium Fever, One Violent night, or even Fasnacht, it's best for everyone to team up, that way all can loot the enemies, even if you don't get a shot on them.
---
It's important in most events to protect something in order to successfully Complete the Event, so killing enemies quickly can be essential, also keep in mind that in the lower level areas like Fasnacht, High level players are going to "One Shot" everything no matter what they are using. 
---
Many High level players, myself included (220+) try to follow behind and finish things off for lower leveled players when we can, but if you're running around in PA bashing everything with a Super Sledge, it can be difficult to get a shot in for us, so the consideration goes both ways, just switch to a high ROF weapon and Tag everything and keep moving when you're at WS, you can circle back and loot everything afterwards.
---
Gave it a listen and really enjoy it, although i think the last minute or so sounds off.
---
Yeah your probably right might have to wait behind 3 or 4 guys at worst, I’m just saying I’m very excited.
---
I go into survival for aid... lol
---
You attacked me when I said you had cool videos, but the knowledge about these things existed. You called me stupid for no reason. Hell, you stalked me to find my youtube. And you don't consider all this an attack? Come on dude, get real. It was creepy and unnecessary.
---
Absolutely, instigating lever action and hunting rifles are incredible
---
Even in death the Responders have more life then the Minutemen...
---
Oh and I do have legendary effects, it’s a Two shot explosive
---
Great idea!! Upvote
---
This is my problem.  I would sell far more stuff if it didn't take up both stash and camp budget.
---
"You picked the wrong house, fool!"
---
Exactly! I want the transition between night and day to be very obvious and realistic. I shouldn't be able to walk into the middle of the woods at night in WV and still see everything perfectly. It should be so dark that glowing radiated bits are the only things you can see sprinkled around you when your flashlight is off.
---
So your argument is the symbolism behind the idea of the Pale Rider is what makes it bad-to-the-bone?
---
I mean, it states its a skin, the atom shop usually doesnt sell the actual item plan
---
Still no caged armor :(
---
Scripping legendary gear should be saved for garbage rolls.. like suppressor's rolling pins
---
It was the survival beta.
---
I agree, I missed out on the first, but War and Pestilence looked very unique.  Death just kinda looks like regular power armor painted white (as you stated).  I find it very underwhelming.  I don't feel bad missing out on this one.
---
squirrel
---
I don’t know. I didn’t get the plan. I wish there was a preview of how it would look.
---
I wish it was easy to get people naked in real life like this....
---
And hell follow with him.
---
Any idea how Furious works? What the stats might be?
---
If teammates are nearby they can already loot. XP would be nice, though. Even reduced XP would be cool.
---
take a photo of your friend while they are scrapping a 3\* legendary item as you are being revived 5 times! Lol
---
Thank you...
---
I hadn't thought about it, but that would be the balance of power armor they need right there.  Everything else sucks at some resistance except PA. And then you can balance the PAs, making 45 a little more vulnerable to energy  and stronger to ballistic but still a lot better than metal armor against energy.
---
haha, good idea, ''Nothing to see here, move along"  
---

It's still the most powerful defense you can get for PvP
---
Thx all.. launched my first nuke.... Have a nice day
---
Have them all at once, the helmet, arms, legs and torso all different paints.
---
Well.. I live *really* rurally... on a moonlit, starry, cloudless night, the woods are crazy bright. *SHADOWS* however are black as pitch.
---
Any obvious signs to look after to recognize dupers in action? ..I just took some cute pics with my prosnap of some weird mix of sub-ten level players and 200++ levels around some container. They started blasting me, thumbs down, puking etc etc
---
Thanks :)
---
That's how I'm beginning to feel about the badges, I've done all the repeatable quests, and the Campfire Tales all together probably 20 times, and haven't gotten a single badge.
---
tried that myself a long while back and no dice. Tried to abuse it while doing a Morgantown Nuke.
---
I would love to see npc leaders of all the factions show back up to Appalachia.  Imagine all the new quests and faction content.
---
Do you know if there’s gonna be a maintence?
---
I want good looking handrails to put around stairwells or at least walls that look the same on both sides.
---
I agree.  This would tear through PvE, but so would almost any Instigating Unarmed weapon.  Against something with more HP, like the SBQ, I would think Bloodied and Anti-Armor are vastly superior.
---
Well they don't take a lot of stash space, my idea was this - keep as much ammo as you're willing to sacrifice stash space (say 1 pound).
---
.308 ammo weighs 0.006 - you could have 166 rounds for sale. Even if they sit for awhile, one pound is not that much stash space.
---
Basically it's subjective based on how much available space you have in your stash and shop. If you are sitting at close to 800 in your stash and you find you don't sell the bullets - obviously don't include them and just drop them. 
---
Shop success will vary from person to person - so many random variables - what players are on your current server for example.
---
Basically the same as cap vendors.
---
i agree. i deliberately saved my points up thinking that the death rider skin would be the coolest. he has always been my favorite rider but i was utterly disappointed with the look of this skin. i don't think i'm going to get it... unless it has some unique hidden feature.
---
Makes sense. I'd really love for my camp to darken to pitch black so I can turn it into a strobe light seizure-causing shitfest lmao
---
I'll try it when i get home. I know that the people usually had to be nearby their vending units, but if this helps, then great!
---
Turn the brightness down on your tv/monitor.  On my home tv it's pretty bright at night but when I'm away playing on my other tv where I have to keep the brightness down it's super dark.
---
"Hey I just some mushroom clouds over where Whitespring use to be."
---
"How many?"
---
"Too many to count."
---
Orange sponge carpet.
---
Bethesda:"We've added vending machines."
---
BlakThumb: "I heard 'cabinets'."
---
See before this I was just grinding the same 3-4 spots. That is tedium right there.
---
These are certainly not the best as far as quests go, but it did break my daily routine &amp; has given a much needed breath of fresh air. Decided I'd shun fast travel for most of it as well, once I got found how easy it is to clear 1400 caps / day I've been fast travelling everywhere. Good way to miss what I consider one of the stronger aspects: roaming the Wastes.
---
Yeah I know, that means that they are moving the duped stuff to mule accounts to keep them there and then probably sell them.
---
I got bass/snares credit by playing the ones in my camp, but i couldn’t get credit for playing anything in nukashine or rusty pick
---
Take picture while fast traveling backwards next to an alien and A GRAHM
---
It’s a little stringy
---
Totally worth it, friend of mine did some test and said the ‘nerf’ was a joke.
---
*daddy
---
Don't forget "Take a picture of the dude who things everything is duped next to 10 shakers of salt: 10 Atoms"
---
No thanks, I want to see what I'm playing.
---
The CRAFTING message...
---
Now I actually wanna see some scorched doing a yoga class, hahahaha
---
Uugghh...I completely forgot about the 30 item limit! It all makes perfect sense now...
---
Nice! I work hard to incorporate my extractors as part of my main structure and workshop. It's so satisfying when you get it looking right
---
Is it like an alien looking thing that crawls around kinda? I killed one by Charleston where the Grafton monster often appears
---
Heeeey! Looks like you found my buddies!

Server hop at that same location. It’s one of the most reliable.

You can't just assume there was wrong doing they may have been trying to move items from one account to another.
---
Yeah. You should see him as you spawn in, if you fast travel to the resort itself. He'll be to your right.
---
Super sledge modded with heating coils gives shock damage
---
This is awesome! Really hope it works for everyone
---
Sweet! I appreciate it!
---
Just mod a weapon with electric
---
As someone who suffers from mild colorblindness they need to bring back the way to change all of the marker/pipboy/text colors like they were in FO3 &amp; FO4. This will help us visually impaired dwellers explore the wasteland a little easier.
---
I tried that first of course. Support requires logging in on bethesda.net, which never takes my saved and viewable password.
---
The way this series work, if I get the pale raider I will look look like t51b even though I’m in X01, is that correct?
---
never used my favorites bar might have to check into using it.
---
Aaaalright, hmm.. The prosnap pics saves gamertags above peoples heads right?
---
Just once: the real agility course was parkouring my way up the legs and arches of the bridge to find the random crossbar I died on
---
Ok have been on the leaderboard within 15mins of doing nothing. 
---
Was in a server where all 3 of the top 3 had 0 points or whatever. Multiple times I’ve been in 3rd with 0. Quit going in survival after that.
---
I believe so, yes.
---
I did, can't log in.
---
Did you have to trick them into placing there?
---
Skyrim was the worst about this. I could not read some of the notes/books/journals...
---
A backpack
---
I can help this evening. My gamertag is ebolahash. I need the water revive as well. 
---
Mic is lost but I'm game
---
I know, thats why I haven’t judged anyone because they might as well just transferred some caps.
---
 I can BekBekk94 :)
---
Off the top of my head I know these can be modded to deal electrified damage: Chinese officer sword, assaultron blade, Mr. Hand buzzblade.
---
Get a good Zealots Primed 50cal (if you aren’t a low-health build; bloodied if you are, obviously) and make that your scorched-anything killer. Ammo is pricey (keep an eye out for queen nukes, that’s your ammo source) but it *melts* scorchbeasts.
---
Shepherd staff, assualtron blade, baton, chinese sword, hatchet, and mr. Handy buzzblade all have electrical mods.
---
The answers for the swimmers exam questions 16 and 20 are incorrect. The answers listed don’t even show up as possible responses for me.
---
I have to try again and equip the weapon - thanks for the tip!
---
ah ok you are factoring in adrenaline boosts and bloodied modifier for adrenal reaction
---
commando shouldnt affect the fixer though right?
---
stalked? lol sure. you have a post on reddit showing off your camps. not really stalking if you put the information out there. you even put the link. I dont consider it attacking, but if you do, why you keep coming back to my post? why come back to the person attacking you?
---
The 1000 scrip cap is truly annoying. My play time is down to a bare minimum because i have no more mules to carry my stuff and can’t unload them because of the limit. Same with the 25k caps limit. Does Bethesda want people to play the game or not? 🤮
---
I don’t know I haven’t even checked that thing out jet hahah
---
You have to have the underlying item unlocked for crafting before you can use the skin. I believe it mentions that in the item text below the pictures.
---
You can probably still get a refund if you ask.
---
Buy the assaultron blade electrified mod from a venderbot and attach to an assault on blade or the electric fusion hatchet mod and attach, there’s an electric mod for the mr handy buzz blade and one or more of the swords.
---
The color ones are too dim and the bright ones are too bright. I wish we could adjust the brightness iurselves.
---
It can be made automatic, then commando is the perk. My fixer has tweaked automatic I think
---
Consideration goes a real long way. I run bloodied with a bloodied SS and full unyeilding armor, q hit pretty much everything in the game. I do carry a modded out Tse 10mm pistol with tri paint on it that I use for events and such. During nuke zones I almost always end up with 1-2 lower levels that see that damage I do and try to sneak in front of me, I let them get their licks and they will move and let me finish them off. It's actually kinda fun doing that too.
---
How far away are you? Shotguns have short range, modded shotguns have VERY short range. Damage dropoff is extreme on them; way back when it didn’t matter because they did absurd damage, so even with range dropoff it still killed things. After the last two, they should be “proper” if you are in appropriate range for them.
---
Sorry not egouth atoms for that. But those bone totems ROCK!
---
Not once I was super surprised. Passed on the first go.
---
I have the heavy backpack plan, if you just hold it you learn it
---
but but but another settlement needs our help!
---
This is a horrible issue. I don't think it gives you your budget back when you take objects out of the machine either.
---
I haven't bought it but seen it at the event.
---
It should be like pa paint when you go to modify a crafted backpack (or even the level 20 one they give you)
---
Maybe a dumb question... What bag is this, and it works like a world container instead of stash? First I've seen it.
---
I still have it installed, am still subscribed here, and might come back to it sometime. I still have opinions that are just as valid as anyone else's and hope that Bethesda starts making better choices.
---
How do you place a bag? For me, it says dropping it destroys it.
---
Never had the need for a night vision scope because it’s essentially a green scope when everything is already so clearly visible lol. If you remove the stars the night looks the same as day.
---
I just want my mother lovin BOS flag and flag pole.
---
It lets you wear hats and helmets
---
 No face items or glasses. Beware of clipping and it also removes facial hair
---
Do let us know what you think when you meet her today!
---
Good bot...oh wait nvm
---
Yeh could well be, I just don’t react as I’m rubbish at PVP it would be a waste of caps.
---
I second that I’m slightly confused, if it ain’t a brown bag you lost me
---
I've always who on earth would be able to run out of stims, radaways or rad-xs.
---
I didnt fall off during the challenge, but i did fall off one time before. Wasnt in power armor and somehow survived the fall. Didnt even cripple a leg.
---
PS4 unfortunately but thanks
---
It consumes a large chunk of my life to say the least
---
These ridiculous challenges make the game fun.  pretty sure this lead for some side splitting HILARITY in my fo76 team. "quick get out of your PA!" *picture click * "quick get back in!"
---
Skull mask works with hats and helms (though some clip) Great!
---
It also removes facial hair... not so great.
---
Girl you trendy playing your fallout 76 and all
---
Lol must be nice
---
yea like...whats the story with this?

I love my instigating Mole Miner gauntlet 1\* for PVE. The +1E is decent the swing speed is A huge bonus!

If you are on Xbox and don't want to keep it how many caps would ya take for it? I'll offer 8,500caps if you cant find a better offer.
---
Doesn't the gamma wave receiver cause burning damage?
---
Buyer beware you must buy haircut for your sex. Wtf bethesda?
---
Only you can decide that.
---
I see.  I mean that could have been it but I do not think I was that far away.  Hard to give a distance in game.  About 10 feet would be my guess so pretty close but out of melee range
---
Thanks for the info. Was holding out until I found out
---
oh cool i didnt realize if could be automatic as well

---
Take a photo of a player scrapping 3* legendaries while naked apart from a tin foil hat riding chally the moo moo while Graham looks on in disgust, all during a rad storm, all with a night vision lens that you need 5 possom scout badges to buy lol
---
I think you failed to see the point of the minutemen, just because Bethesda didn't give them too much life does not mean they're not good. If you follow through with their whole story and history you will realize they have much more depth and history then the responders. The responders are all of the emergency services personal that survived the great war. They have their own story, but other the holotapes theres nothing else to them, they're gone, dead. The minutemen however rose from the ashes and are still alive 200 Years after the bombs dropped. The responders literally only survived what 20 years or so?
---
You can get away with low energy resistances in game. About the only one that’s a real threat are scorchbeast sonic blasts (oh and Assaultron laser) Most other nasty attacks are melee hits or armor piercing mr gutsy ballistic damage.
---
No it's frustrating 😭
---
correct. she no longer drops them.
---
originally I was planning to just build around it, to my surprise, they just snapped into place straight on top of the extractor, The location is the one way up north, above Freddy fears house of scares, just before the mountains.  [https://imgur.com/a/xEV9rgF](https://imgur.com/a/xEV9rgF)

Any word on a fix for this u/valseek or am  i better of getting a refund?
---
After the Brahmin are milked they take time to refill, just like real cows. :)
---
I hit a few that were dry, but kept hopping from Brahmin to Brahmin and found a few that were ready. Just keep at tit.
---
Last night i finally got all the Ghoul Golfers! They did seem to be doing less damage to me than other Ghouls but then again i dont farm the Clubhouse so i have no idea what their normal behavior is.
---
Shouldn't be an issue when the legendary vendor is in. You're limited to 150 a day, cashing it in it's plenty.
---
Not sure, but I wish I had a perk card that let any of them do what Perfect Storm does. Energy Weapons have no love in perk card land :(

It's a brown bag with a remodel :)

ok, what is the deal with all the downvotes on this? this guy is offering to make delicious smores! who doesnt like that?
---
what magic is this
---
Find some level 0 terminals, then go run a nuke silo. Nuke silo is required anyway, and has enough level 2-3 terminals to get you there. Maybe even level 1 terminals as well.
---
If you are on PC I'd be interested in it.
---
Me too but I want also it with the ability to pee on a circular rug as well.... so then I can scold it, remind it we do that outside and chuck it outside of the camp. Afterwards it’ll learn its lesson so I’ll retrieve it and coddle it before setting it on the Rug once more. :)
---
I kinda agree. the theme they went with is "cleanness", "cleanse the wasteland with the pale rider".
---
not saying it's my favorite skin, I do think it's a tad under-designed, but it's fitting.
---
Nice, I'm on the iron deposit just outside of Flatwoods, I'm going to have to try this out today.
---
Just because they're all bloggers that record every worthless conversations doesn't give them more depths than the Minutemen.
---
aka they're both shallow but don't really need to be much more.
---
Yes but the Appalachian flying monkeys are HUGE.
---
Nope, but cat meat = agility so eat your fill.

id kind of rather just have more camp budget IMO. my home is under decorated due to having my Scrap Shack mini store outside of my house

I wouldn't call them rare, but they are more expensive to craft since you need plastic. I have over 3,000 fusion cells just from playing, more than any other ammo type. It just depends what you spend time doing.
---
Thanks for the great post! Helps a lot since I can't pull up Bethesdas site where Im at.
---
move your camp...
---
Ehh… it's a bit like the dogs in The Division 1&amp; 2...
---
yeah, I *caaaannnnn* kill them... but I feel like an ass for doing it.
---
My handy blade with electrical mod is still my go-to for golfer farming. Just kinda grinds through the things.
---
ps4 here, its been like this for me since i started playing, alot of the screen is cut off for me
---
Think you meant to reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/boa8k1/tariffs_have_hit_appalachia_hard/ene0sj9/) ;)
---
Yeah, wish I'd seen this before forking $20 to pick up a new skin for myself and (more importantly) my kid whose power armor I trashed because I didn't read the 'destroy' warning fast enough..  
---
I get it, my mistake in not reading the warning but doesn't take away from the fact that this is a total dick move on Bethesda's part.  
---
It quickly turned what could have been a positive, a way to encourage me to spend more into a negative.
---
He means the diseased tag overwrites the legendary tag on ghouls pretty often, so many of the ghouls you might not even bother to loot (because it doesnt say legendary) probably has a legendary. Only happens to 1 stars though.
---
With the SBQ flying in the background at less than 10% hp.....
---
Exactly. Wastelands gunna waste
---
People missing Dogmeat so much we're ready to pay cash for a clickable rock. Lol
---
There's multiple level 3 terminals at Poseidon. All the entrances and exits that get locked down when the Power Up quest is active are. The entrance by the Core Processor and the entrance to the west are the easy ones to find.
---
Nobody else sees the remodel unless they have the mod too, right?
---
If it works, you're a hero OP. Let's find out.
---
I tested this a couple days ago (Saturday), and the Sacrificial Mod does still add a 4th Star to a 3\* Machete, but the legendary Scrip machine does not recognize them as being any more than a 3\*.
---
I'm not being unreasonable.
---
Thank you, Legend. I have to admit I was too dense to consider the Bethesda website.
---
When majority play more than hundred hours of this game, i think you can invest without any fear.
---
The Flatwoods monster floats and has a purple head. I think your describing a snallygaster
---
If this works then I'll put a stash box by my vending machine.
---
Yup they just get the sad old brown bag
---
I knew about the Diseased bug and always loot anything, get those sweet sweet caps. I must have just had a crap server, usually at the minimum I get two or three legendaries
---
There is a billboard by 98 NAR Regional that has multiple cats that you can build a camp near. Problem is they are flagged hostile. So no fast travel and turrets kill them.
---
I also want a TENT, as well as increased build budget. I don't know how many times I've been so close to what I think perfect will be, when I run out of budget lol. Plus they keep adding new items for your CAMP, so you have to delete old things to add new, and it kinda sucks. 
---
But a TENT would be great, because sometimes you're in the middle of exploring a neat area, but need to make more bullets, or just want to chill for a minute, and maybe cook some dinner.
---
Good luck :) oh and where I place the marker is a neat cave.
---
I have a quad laser rifle I was using as a tagging/danger close weapon (since my two mains are explosive), it was decent with everything maxed out and beam splitter. It does break way too easily, though. I ended up finding a vampire 10mm SMG in my last play session that gives me heals while also being better in every regard. Time to retire the old laser until they get a significant buff.
---
It is a hell of a lot easier farming the event for the badges, but personally I have really enjoyed the world challenge badges. I found myself venturing into the wendigo cave with a camera in hand, picking up as many bones as I could find while wearing a fedora. The challenge badges made me go out and experience a lot of what the game has to offer again.
---
why did you build where sb ghouls and sm live
---
It’s really not, constantly washing and rinsing Legendaries would be horrible for the game, cap limit right now is damage control for inflation and ppl valuing things at exorbitant prices, at least vendors aren’t 200 a day anymore!
---
Haha I'm just trying to emulate the outrage you get on here when anyone mentions anything slightly naughty!
---
Yes ^ 100%
---
Yeah, that happens too sometimes.
---
Another lvl 2 terminal: Sons of Dane compound, inside the pre-war house, upper floor.
---
I have just a TS handmade and didn't notice the actual number but quickly realized after going up against a few mobs that somehow I was very noticeably dealing more damage.  I switched to a rifle build simply because i love the way the handmade shoots and finally that switch has paid off.
---
I'm already at 1000, when I tried to drop more in, it gave me a warning says 'you will get 0 scrip from this legendary because you've reached the 1000 limit'
---
When the vendor comes out it won't make it any easier. Three star legendaries worth 40, assuming it won't be what we need and will go right back, that leaves us 110 per day to grind, if you're lucky and got three 3-star legendary rolling pins, stop playing because you're at 120 already.
---
Yep, my kid and I went and scrounged up the nuka paint job but in the end, only I wound up with the plan. - I painted his stuff and we both sport it around.  
---
I bought the black rider skin thinking (correctly) that he'd want it fiercely and before I knew it, I'd toasted his X-01 because I blew past the 'destroy' warning.
---
They weren't there when I arrived, also it's a ridiculously cool location.
---
You are, actually.
---
No one naturally finds fusion cells more often than .38 or etc. I have 1,500 fusion cells collected. Considering I haven't used any thats a pretty low number. They're in fact rarer than any ammo I find besides Gamma or Cyro. By definition they are rare.
---
This is where my mind goes. 
---
I want a permanent CAMP.. .and then a teeny-tiny budget mobile CAMP. 
---
I get that we *can* make it happen with blueprints... but that means my permanent CAMP vanishes, and I don't want that.
---
I sell serums for 250c you can sell them to vendors for almost twice that you're welcome
---
Lol oh gosh. Scorched flying monkeys
---
My camp is located in the area that there are no native scorched or super mutants live. Yet they do spawn sometimes to attack my camp. I don't think it has anything to do with the location you're in.
---
Can we also apply this to the Tadpole exam area. Every time I take a test someone fast travels and spawns a bunch of ghouls that are up my ass while I’m in the terminal.
---
That's awesome, thank you for this, kind person.
---
What time you have in mind?
---
I'm looking forward to this on Thursday but...I know I will be disappointed as it's rng and that's the fun of it, if this is to become and remain a permanent part of the game then it's an excellent addition, gives every little man a chance too. Everyone will want scout armour lol
---
How ?
---
It was tested I believe by a twitch stream I watch, Battlestations I think and it was determined to not effect explosive weapons
---
Thanks for letting people know! It's appreciated. Your character looks great, btw! :D
---
I’ve never seen a definitive answer but the most commonly suggested values are +5% per hit with a cap of either 30% or 50%.
---
It’s extremely hard to measure and test though. But those are the most common values that I’ve seen people suggest over the past few months
---
until you realize they count as enemies in the dark zone and you can just farm those instead of players? Friend just shot the dogs for no reason to trigger me whenever we came across one.
---
Yes please
---
I don't want messages from random strangers, thanks.  Also, servers aren't static, what happens if I am server hoping or if you leave the server - I'm not going to know who the hell you were.
---
If you haven’t done this I’m up for it. GT Mr W S0bchak .
---
you should scout your location first. hang out there a while to see if random encounters happen there. i found a nice spot. i left to store important camp items to move my camp. when i came back there was a team of 60+ supermutants with miniguns and a hoard of 60+ ghouls. another time there was an assultron dominator, and another a sentry bot.
---
all of them, everything is overpriced
---
some things are seriously ridiculous
---
they could reduce the actual cost of atoms to help, or lower in store prices
---
I only get stuff in game if it goes on sale
---
Don't forget to hit up the water fountain to get a free disease cure when you kill em all.

There was a glitch a while ago with traps you could infinitely disable for xp and scrap, I would go there and kill people doing it for aluminum them break the trap
---
Happens to me too lately. Twice yesterday. I'm on PC like (most?) posters in this thread. Could it be related to mods?
---
They affect gameplay when you accidentally destroy your kids power armor.....  
---
Dude is doing a public service by warning people but you waste time/photons on calling him troll?  Step off, tool.
---
That's odd, I got credit for bones disarming bone chimes at west tek.
---
Still though I'll update my post as there's plenty of other options for finding bones.er
---
I'd also suggest buying an Electrified mod for an Assaultron Blade, as that blade is needed for another badge (Roboticist?)
---
Shagadelic.
---
Just add in game chat... 100x better solution than this.
---
right now, join on me lol
---
Stalker's Golf Clubs.
---
I have somehow managed to find 2 of them in 3 days.
---
It would be cool if everyone could kind of choose to join a faction or something
---
That's what the C.A.M.P. was for originally.
---
But if you could offload that Scrapshack to a TENT, that would free up some budget for your CAMP decor...
---
I used the teapot event took 3 goes to spawn but worked.
---
Anyone have a pick of the new pack skin?
---
LOL, so very true.
---
To be fair, they didn't have to fight infinite gigantic bats with wall hacking poison attacks.
---
is it a new floor or just a floor decoration? Either way it sounds neat i'm just curious. Gonna look dope with my astroturf.
---
♥️
---
where is the mod found
---
Thanks! I’ll have to check later. Good thing I put a stash next to my machines.
---
Oh I need this.
---
Exorbitant price is fine, that's how capitalism works. If people can't afford them, price will come down. I can't demand a cap on car prices because my jobless uncle can't afford an expensive model.  That's old style socialism and it kills people's motivation to work.
---
Regardless I like the location. I would be fine with the timed period spawns but when you have respawns every time someone fast travels you can have full wave respawns 3 times in a minute. That's a flawed system.
---
I have never entered the Dark Zone. Dozens of hours in The Div1, and not once did I go in.
---
I haven't really dug too deep into The Div 2 yet, FO76 is meeting all my video game needs right now.
---
1*?
---
Happened to me too, but it went back to the original amount after a server hop. I think it's just a display bug.
---
1☆ 300-500 each
---
2☆ 400-1000
---
3☆ 1000+ depending on 2nd and 3rd perks
---
Reading this post makes me want to build my camp in one of these places on purpose for that sweet XP.
---
Now imagine you just trashed your kids power armor over it.....
---
Very logical to nerf an armor set that can be countered by any nog legendary gamma gun with a deep disch and signal repeater. 
---
They actually gave into the bullys complaining they could not one shot all their victims.
---
Shall we now spam bethesda to remove legendarys from the game so i can make a new character and be just as powerfull as a level 400 who spent weeks in the game getting what he wanted?
---
Also the NV scope. I am colorblind and can barely see the crosshairs.
---
Ah yeah I know what you mean about the 3 star 40 scrip not going into 150. Leave 30 scrip to fill with 1 and 2 stars.
---
At least skyrim had mods
---
There is a tin foil outfit coming to the atomic shop.  That with the tin foil hat might look more traditional to the Tin Man.  Plus the tin foil man pun.  Don't forget his ax ;)
---
New floor option.
---
Not sure why, but this reminds me of the basement areas in Hearthfire from Skyrim. I would love this.
---
Truly subjective. I used a quad laser rifle as my main for quite a while (about 15 levels), and up until my last session it was a backup/close range weapon. I've never crafted any cells, and I currently have over 3,000 in my vending machine. I've been playing a little under 120 hours. Take from that what you will.
---
Now, to be fair, I wasn't exactly farming the cells, but I do spend a good amount of time at Sugar Grove (springs), General's Steakhouse (it's near my camp, and muties drop gunpowder), Harper's Ferry (legendaries), and 98 NAR (cores). All of those locations have either exclusively robot spawns, or lots of muties (and muties just love carrying their charging laser sniper rifles). 
---
TL;DR - I fight a lot of robots, and I get a lot of cells.
---
Ye baby yeah.... Thanks for heads up
---
yeah i agree, i ve said it multiple times but for some reason soooo many people on this sub instantly downvote this.... i honestly dont understand why...
---
the perks for night eyes and the mods for night vision are worthless in 90% of the game, only the Mire is nice and dark
---
we go to do the campfire tales event and even in the middle of the night it looks like day time
---
honestly the only way i can tell if its night is if i look up and see stars
---
Coming
---
at night time? hes not talking about everything being made darker, just...you know...night time...
---
Ty, and Oooohhhhh..will have to check it out
---
On PC here.  I have had it happen on Purified Water, Ribeye Steak, RadAway, and a few other aid items.  I think it can potentially happen from consuming any aid item from the pip-boy.  Has never happened consuming aid items assigned to favorites keys.  This has been around for at least 2 patches, maybe 3.  I saw u/LadyDevann acknowledge a post about it back then, and she said she was passing it along to the team.  But no word on it since, and no fix yet.
---
2\* Weapons (all the real good stuff is in the first two stars
---
3\* armor (weight reduction FTW)
---
Check various vendors. I think one in Watoga is a good start
---
is this a joke post?
---
#Main Armor Chest Piece.  
---
#Main Armor Right Arm.

#Main Armor Right Leg.....
---
Furious... plasma... flamer...
---
That is all :)
---
Amen!! I don't even try any more! 🙌
---
&gt;Everyone had pretty much 1 shot weapons and super armour so we were all completely evenly matched
---
If this is accurate, then either the seven players (including yourself) acquired the "1 shot weapons and super armor) honestly through grinding gameplay, or they were duped/received from someone who had duped them.
---
If the "1 shot weapons and armor" were acquired honestly, then your rant about the preponderance of duped weapons is pointless. If they were either duped or acquired from someone who had duped them, then the participants in this seven player "circle jerk"  bear a much greater burden of the blame for there being an overabundance of duped weapons than does Bethesda.
---
because bethesda doesnt want them, so people get so blindly fan boy crazy they downvote anything that they think might be ragging on the game or bethesda
---
besides, i bet we will get npcs soon with the new dlc
---
Why would you think it was a joke?
---
Send them to me too, I'd like to see how sharp your Photoshop skills are :)
---
PSA to others: No, he doesn't :)
---
Console? I need to purge one character. Need 10 different
---
You should anyway, I'm usually at max weight so I appreciate if I can put my new toys away before I changed my gear. Speaking of over carry. If youre on ps4, I can gift you a lot of crap. Did the mule thing to delete 2 old characters and now im sitting at 1000/180 in flatwoods right now.
---
wow, back off fanboy, we all like the game or else we wouldnt be on this sub
---
you dont have to be so defensive, this is a discussion
---
I think you nailed it on the remote play. I can’t imagine doing that on a delay. Are you on Xbox? You can have my hoard of picks  if you want it.
---
All I get are mole rats and scorchbeasts. So I hear turrets and I either run out to find mole rats eating my fences, or SBs leveling my camp. I didn't realize when I dropped anchor there that I was between two fissure sites.
---
Just got my first badge on attempt 27 woohoo!
---
"Beth plz move spawns since i camped in a tactically unsound place"
---
Oh dear please kind God let this work.
---
PLEASE.
---
Not worth. You have to repair decorations at least once a day
---
Nice write up Sly, both informative and entertaining!  Thanks for taking the time to contribute.  I'm working on this badge now, so good timing.
---
I also hate killing a fox.  Swore I wouldn't do it.  A badge is a badge though.
---
On using the camera to take pics....at first I thought the camera was gimiky, maybe even dumb.  But since using it for quests like this I've been framing up some really neat shots that look great as screen savers, pics I never would have taken without the challenge.
---
objective survive
---
You monster!!
---
I'd like a TENT, even if it pulled from the same budget as the CAMP.
---
Going to try this later myself. Will place a my stash box near my vendors. If this works..... I just want you to know I love you, you are special, have a wonderful life.  
---
Take all of the upvotes!
---
omg hope it works
---
I never said that. Stop being willfully ignorant. I'm fine with the timed period spawns but when you have respawns everytime someone fast travels to your camp you can literally have 3 respawns in one minute.
---
Ikr im protanopia color blind and i cannot always see the super mutants that are hiding in the bushes or the ones that are blended in
---
I was mostly joking. Building a simple concrete block camp might be worth it though.
---
Red Dead Redemption 2 does it as well. Can try and decipher Arthur's (or whoever's) shoddy printing or just read the plain text, it's nice.
---
I got a 3 star bloodied super sledge with like 40% faster swing. Best drop I have ever gotten. Though I never use it, I prefer my unarmed DCG. I have debated selling it, but I could never pull the trigger.
---
nah.  it's fine as-is.
---
I am not trying to be funny when I say this, but what answer do you realistically expect to get when you visit /r/fo76 and ask this question?
---
Of course we're all going to say yes.
---
Might be worth asking on /r/fallout. You can balance the negative you get there with the positive you get here and decide yourself.
---
Same here. Glad they added this.
---
The worst thing is that you can take things out of, and other people can purchase your vending merchandise, decreasing the amount you have in it while at max budget, but you won't be able to replace them.
---
Saw a guy yesterday that had one of each on and a random 4th, didn’t look too bad I gotta say.
---
If it's not Scottish, it's CRAP!
---
Decided it would be fun to race my friend, didn't use my power armor because we die like men.  Missed a step, fell 50ft and went full lawnchair after hitting the cross section of one of the bridge uprights when I then began to slowly slide down it like Wiley Coyote running into a pole only to free fall ragdoll style through the air to do a perfect lawn dart landing into the ground below.  Was not my most graceful moment but I did stick the landing.
---
If you do the tadpole swimming test, the instructions over the speaker. It's no surprise
---
they need to focus on re-doing the challenges and the atom store prices.  I just simply refuse to spend that much money on those skins unless its priced appropriately. and no, 18 dollars for a PA paint is not appropriately priced.  it should be 7-10 at best
---
Also if this works then someone give this man an award.
---
If you look at my screenshot in my OP in the upper right corner you see the word "Fossils" in the viewfinder.  You have to be using the prosnap camera AND make sure it's displaying the word "fossils" to get credit.  
---
It takes some wrangling to get the word to appear, I had to move around quite a bit.
---
You don't need to tag for legendaries in a group. Event groups you do, but if you formed a party yourself no, you don't need to tag for legendaries.
---
And while 3 Brahmins, 4 Deathclaws and 1 Scorchedbeast queen are watching you from exactly 15 meters away
---
I also don't think you also can get your budget back from it.
---
15 meters is 16.4 yards
---
"They too spout the same four or five lines of horseshit repeatedly"
---
protect and serve
---
how may i help you maaaaaaaa'aaam
---
Yep agreed. I love to play fallout for the immersive environments and settings. Nothing rips me out of that immersion worse than perfectly clear vision in the middle of the night
---
happened to me 5 minutes ago (PC)
---
was on another player's camp, CTD; then infinite load screen, so I had to terminate it
---
log in and everything is unlisted &gt;:/
---
The best way I've found is to pick a spot in Savage Divide and start walking.  I normally land at the East Ridge Lookout, as it has a chance to spawn there, and then just walk south through the Divide until I find out. If you have a friend in the Divide, try FT to their base, because that can trigger a spawn, too. Granted you're gonna probably get a lot more scorched than FWM, but it's worth a shot.
---
I had three legendary spawns at Harper's Ferry the other night, all of whom were three star. I got three one star items, including (of course) a nocturnal wood chest piece. Thanks game. Thanks.
---
Because it's a skin and not a paint. So far this has been only for the Rider skins. And i believe from now on they will be paints like they were before.
---
Got some values for a level 25 cryolator for you... not ideal but it’s a start lol once I have numbers for a 45 I’ll respond again
---
Note I had 30% heavy gunner and 15% bloody mess on at the time. Forgot to take them off...
---
Standard barrel = 36 Energy dmg with my perks (same as what your calculator is giving me right now)
---
Crystallizing barrel = 57 Ballistic &amp; 28 Energy dmg with my perks. Some reverse math would give us approx 38 &amp; 19.
---
Hopefully this is useful. When I get some materials to spare I can craft a level 35 and 45 with the barrel and get true values without perks
---
Even a 1* explosive mini gun is fun. Given the wild aiming I believe TS is perfect for the heavy. 
---
I run 3 full heavy gunner and full stabilized with my TS *** Gatling with a * in faster fire rate. It’s fast, loud and hits 191 a shot.
---
Exactly. I only get a limited time to play and having to fumble around in the dark and possibly miss something is not fun. If they made it optional, I wouldn't care.
---
people want darker nights in game and you suggest turning down your tv brightness, if that is not a joke then.... im worried about you
---
I put a Alien Blaster for like 7575c, and then found the recipe for the fusion cell mags for it and will probably put it for some ridiculous amount. Will it sell, probably not. but I think everyone should have that one joke item in their machine.
---
There should be one at there shooting range on the table found it twice there
---
Just a Craft and Craft Max would be fine even.
---
Not once... and I made it even more difficult by only using throwing knives (long story, basically I ended up with over 300 of them thinking I could sell them 🤦‍♂️)
---
Just call me an Apocalyptic American Ninja Warrior 🤺
---
What he said.
---
I named my four different sets of power armor and put a # at the beginning so I dont have to:
---
1. Scroll around looking for the differently named sets
---
2. Dont have to pull out all four chassis to figure out which one is which
---
Then we need a settlement that we can have permanently so we can move our camp around
---
Love the Responders!
---
You are the best.
---
If only we could place garden gnomes as decoration, you could have your lollipop guild!
---
Last night they were all lying down outside by the golf carts and didn't mind me walking all over them. However once I shot them they got teleported to wherever they were supposed to be and then ran at me aggro'd
---
Which was kinda funny as i had no idea how many i had aggro'd and they were still running up to me about give minutes later.
---
I've been playing 120 hours and I never knew this. Most diseases, I just let them run their course since I rarely find disease cures, and most of the debuffs I can live with. This changes everything!
---
Haven't encountered it lately but for a while, my game would crash if I dropped something (usually spoiled food) and ate something without closing my pipboy inbetween (allow bag spawn to initiate).  Now, I generally make a conscious effort to either drop stuff or use consumables but not both at the same time.
---
I favorite my main ones.
---
And if it is scottish its crap
---
dude. :drools:
---
That would be my backup when I absolutely have to wear PA for whatever reason.
---
i know we dont really need them much since its never really dark, but we do have pip boy flashlights as well as PA headlights, and also miner hats, that illuminate the dark
---
not sure why we even have day-night cycle, its more of a day-day cycle
---
I'm thinking like the large tent with designated areas around the inside you can choose from 2-3 things to put in each spot - like how you choose what version of a wall to place, you select a spot and swipe through the elements you can place there. 
---
Maybe no power, so lighting is limited to fire pits and lanterns. And the vending machine could be a smaller version that shows up on the map but not as a fast-travel spot since it doesn't have full power.
---
They could be different mods to the new backpack system - trading storage space for a crafting tent or portable store.
---
I think so, I mean. I've never liked shotguns. But wxosive is pretty bad now
---
The drops have become bothersome. I literally sell out of caps and scrip each day and have to drop everything i can't sell at my camp in hopes someone will come grab them before they vanish.
---
I definitely would not draw dickbutts in people’s guest book.
---
It’s obvious once you figure it out lol I had trouble figuring out what they wanted initially as well.
---
Yeah that guy hated his job lol
---
find the shooting targets, it's right there
---
I should start farming them myself and selling them
---
Backpack. For sale. In the Atomic Shop. Not related to any event or paint.
---
If you know you're gonna be gone awhile they ignore camps with no power. Worth putting a flamer on switch to destroy the fusion reactor.
---
Hoo boy, they've really improved the realism in the latest patch. I've spent the last 30+ hours being "raised" by a scorch beast queen who adopted me. Who knew that wearing the witch costume and fasnacht soldier mask would make ol' momma scorchy think I was a baby scorch beasty! I can't believe that BGS was able to make this game so immersive! I can actually smell the momma beast and scorchies! Who'da thunk it!
---
I do have to say, I haven't been able to spend much time adventuring, as she won't let me out of the nest. And spending 4 hours a day of play time being kept warm by cuddling a scorched beast anus isn't the most pleasant way to spend my day, but I guess it's part of the game. I'm still kind of wondering what my SBQM (Scorched Beast Queen Momma) gets out of this, or why Bethesda would spend time adding it to the game, but I have to say, it's been an interesting week of play.
---
I do wish my character was given more to eat than left over noobs, they're kind of bland, and not really good eating. 
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our scorched role playing group. We meet every Tuesday  in Fissure prime, you should just jump in and join us (never alone)!
---
I've played for 280 hours and I haven't even began to use Energy weapons for the most part. Ballistic ammo is cheaper to make, usually and the damage per shot is superior. It should not be that way.
---
Did similar with water purifiers for indoor plumbing.  There some good points to the recent foundation changes.
---
&gt;permanently reduced price on some items
---
&gt;Aviator fatman
---
Me, who spent the atoms to get that 3 weeks ago: ***(deep inhale)*** FUCK
---
It says that it changes the appearance of it, has an extra warning than the other paints in the atom shop
---
Not gonna lie, this post made me feel better about my travels lol. Only level 60ish, started in beta, stepped away for a month or so around Jan/Feb. Have never ever come across one of these for myself, kept wondering if I either just had \*really\* bad RNG, or if I was doing something "wrong" lol.
---
The short scope has always been pure garbage. The crosshairs are like actual hairs on the screen; they're so thin. Totally useless at night, only of use against pure white backgrounds
---
The way that they put in the tax seems to be per item instead of taxing the entire sale.  For example If you were to sell 1000 ammo for 1 cap each and they taxed 10% on the entire sale, they would remove 100 caps and give you 900 caps.  With them taxing per item this would be .9 per item owed to you.  There are no fractional caps so their tax of .1 cap per item is rounded up to 1 cap leaving you with 0 caps for that item x 1000 still leaving you with 0 caps.
---
Lol yep
---
I'm with you.  I enjoy doing the challenges.  Exploring and discovering is SO much more fun than grinding the same old Event over and over.  Almost gives purpose to the game....
---
You have no idea the things that have happened on this carpet.  The events forever soaked into it.  Ah, memories.
---
It was my main for the longest time. Then I got my DCG and switched. and when I have to run PA I use a furious Gornaks Axe. I have a hard time letting it go. Incase I ever decide to run a bloodied build. Even put the heating coil mod on it.
---
Not really, they break real fast
---
I use a Railway rifle as my main weapons. Every few days I have to craft 2000 spikes and it's so damn tedious to spam craft spikes and smelt steel.
---
So retexture the suicider and change the sound so you don't shoot the messenger
---
Shhh, don't tell them!  Those who shall not be named doesn't need to know we have that which we do not speak of.
---
Really? guess im blind lol
---
i dont seem to have the ability to track challenges at all :( is this a bug on PC. 
---
I know where it should be but my UI dose not show (T to Track).
---
am i missing something or is there a setting i need to change?
---
Awesome, picked up the shovel backback!
---
Awesome! I haven't seen tge movie in a long tme so those small details eluded me lol
---
Yup, guess a weird pvp mode bug thing that occurred since when you take a workshop you are in pvp mode even though you weren't in survival mode?  That was my guess anyway.
---
I'll try and stop by later tonight, hopefully there's stuff left.
---
100% spawn guarantee, Solomon's pond
---
That's why I bought Plague Rider as it fits my X0-1. It was one of my 2 favourites, but after finding out about the skin thing I bought Plague Rider. I like it a lot. ;)
---
im a str melee build but used tse for ranged when needed.
---
Trying to find a decent ranged option.  Its looking like gatling gun.
---
No you don't, I price stuff from my stash all the time for my vending machine, On Xbox (I am sure it is similar on PC and PS4) you push "X" and it will allow you to price directly from the stash.
---
That would work really well!
---
I suggest gatling gun or if you can get your hand on it, a explosive laser, insane accuracy
---
Stop drinking the nukashine and you won't wake up wearing that costume
---
&gt;average person will be playing on a relatively small TV across a room
---
yes for console games, no for pc games. given that fallout 76 was released on console as well...
---
100% The minutemen had no personality, all of the responders (well their corpses) I met seemed like genuinely interesting people with stories. Which is why I want npcs added, because they deserve better. 🥺
---
Non legendary gamma guns with a deep disch and signal repeater could kill a sentinel. In fact I think their only purpose in the game is to kill players. 
---
Lets nerf m too better yet nerf anything that makes kids smash controllers. 
---
Save the world less controllers less plastic.
---
Some of us have other uses for plastic, such as crafting the only ammo type we use. I hate wasting plastic bulking junk to sell.
---
According to some she arrives tomorrow 
---
...
---
I WAS IN ARTILLERY
---
If you obtained item from atom shop or painted it with paint purchased form atom shop, you cannot drop or trade. Otherwise nobody would invest in atoms as you'd be able to spread everything for free.
---
Why my camps now in the forest. My lowly turrets take care of everything with ease.
---
cant you? is the standard color white?
---
This was how I killed 76 Scorched with a heavy weapon. Went to the airport and just beat them to death with a minigun.
---
Ohhhhh. I gots Atoms to spend when I get home today. WOOT!
---
No other way, gotta get both account weight under 1500 I think it is, so you gotta pretty much destroy 500 worth of weight
---
Oh no I completely agree on the balance. It blew my mind the first time I made a batch of .50 ammo with the ammosmith perk how much I got from one batch. Then I made 5mm for the first time. I feel like 5.56 is a little more expensive, but I haven't used a handmade in ages. Either way, you get a ton of ammo. 
---
I just remember the first time I picked up a laser pistol in FO3, getting so excited before realizing that I was better off with my 10mm. In every way.
---
Fyi ,this experiment was done like a month plus ago with zero results.
---
Could've saved yourself a headache and 9 hours with a Google search.
---
Start destroying stuff.
---
If someone was there before you, and picked them up, you'll have to server hop
---
Think he means the normal backpack. You cant sell or drop them.
---
Well, the 75% chance might seem like it's still good, but I'm assuming every piece has its own individual chance. This means that there is only a 5.6% chance that all of the effects will work at the same time.
---
Start with 1 stars OP. Nothing to do with them anyway
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but if I recall correctly all wows potions were craftable, hence, reliable. This is the case for F76s drugs. Magazines and bobbleheads on the other hand were supposed to make you excited. They aren't, and there is no reason to collect em all besides, you know, collecting.
---
I also think you are overemphasing the balance changes or the "one true meta" that would enuse. Having choice between unique situational bonus or a single additional special point wouldn't make the game bonkers. It'd make it more interesting and would bring life to a feature that's otherwise dull.
---
I can certainly see the benefits of that AP refresh load-out— I sometimes wonder if I’m wasting a quickslot with my quantums, hah. I know this all depends on your Perk build, of course, but I’d be interested to hear how well it works. Experience has taught me that whenever I’ve paired my AP perks the benefits were diminished. For example, Lone Wanderer &amp; Action Boy together will refresh a full bar of AP (standing still and at 15 AGL) in about 11 seconds. But, Lone Wanderer alone refills that same bar in about 13 seconds. 
---
Now, I obviously don’t fully know how the AP refresh effect stacks, but (if it acts the same as other armor effects) there might be a ceiling to those benefits. For example, if I have level 2 Traveling Pharmacy + 1 piece of drugs-reducing armor, that’s the same as having level 3 Traveling Pharmacy. No additional armor or perk cards will further reduce those weights.
---
If you haven’t already done so, I’d recommend timing your AP refresh with all your perks and then just take one piece away at a time and try to calculate the changes. I’d definitely like to know if there’s a hard-cap to refresh speed.
---
And what exactly made you all think that anything else would happen?
---
I actually I have the 2nd one lol
---
nice, now all we need is some raider related camp items like Junk walls and spike poles and we can go full raider
---
Nope PS4.  I probably should just move the PS4 out of the family room to my office/game room, since I don't often get "the good TV" but that might cause more problems than it's worth lol.
---
 It was on some patch notes from the past updates, if you go up you absolute weight (1500+ your player base carry) you cant tranfer or drop, just destroy the items till you reach the weight.
---
There's a hard cap of 1500 lbs over your max weight, so unless you can get your carry weight up to 525, you're gonna have to destroy something.
---
You won't be able to pick anything up, so your best bet is to have a friend/teammate/team share weight reducing perks with your mule to try to raise that max, and reduce overall weights
---
Congrats, you're part of the problem as to why there's a hard cap on weight limit.
---
Start destroying things until you get down to 1500.
---
That's why i stopped doing the Imposter event. Seems that people don't bother listening to what you're being told in the game. Downvote me all you want but bethesda knew something when they decided not to add NPC. Players do not care about dialogue/ tapes/ any writings in their games.
---
Have not sold anything, but bought a little, it was painless.  I think it's a great workaround for the abysmal player to player trading system.
---
The damage you see is the damage you put out. There’s no x4.
---
What about if you're at Whitesprings? Can you just go inside the resort and that still counts as a nuke zone?
---
The game was a lot different a month ago, a lot of new content has been put into the game since then. We just wanted to see if anything happened now.
---
Not sure if challenge or lottery.
---
i was visiting a camp outside whitesprings station..
---
they had good stuff but mobs were a problem..
---
I FTd to the station not the camp...
---
" bSAOenable" - I set this to 0 and it fixed (disbaled) AO. Thank you so much for this, I was about to vomit on my screen because of the weird, Bethesda styled AO. Whenever I moved my camera, AO would visually "build up" or "move" for a second or two - which just drove me sick. I didn't touch the game for a few months, and in the initial period after the release, I did not notice this effect. I get the feeling, that this was somehow implemented in a previous patch. Anyway, thanks again.
---
During the BETA, nighttime was pretty dark and people complained. So now we have lighter nights. But yeah, it used to be so you couldn't go very far without a light being necessary.
---
The Ammosmith Perkcard is essential. I make 36 5.56 at a time or 180 5mm at a time.
---
Thank you! That must be what I keep running into.
---
Zero. . .
---
I had to lock the door to my private room as that’s where the rad shower is. You would not believe how many messages I got from players that lost their mutations.  I built my base not far from a landmark so you would walk up opposite of the building. Still have curious bastards leave messages as they pick it and walked right into the shower.
---
Looking back, it was a bit stupid of us to assume that something would happen, but with all that’s changed in the game, we thought it wouldn’t hurt to try.
---
So I logged on and it’s exactly 1344, is that including all 4 bullets, since it’s quad barrel, does that exist? Lol an ddoes it include .25% for one bullet or is there .25% on all 4 lol
---
Did you sell some items through your vending machine? Apparently items being sold count towards camp budget as well. Or so I've read...
---
God bless you sir
---
They added skull decorations. Spikes i think.
---
Yeah, i've seen players like you. And when i see them, i go to the computer and start the possum tests. Then the event will  fail and i'll have a good laugh.
---
Yea, sucks that it is like this. Aaand this was already done by one discord group weeks ago.
---
Shitting on the parade, is that something you do irl?
---
I find them there all the time, but it won't let me pick them up.
---
https://www.dvidshub.net/image/14145/monster-garage
---
There are a couple of items in the atom store now that might work well for that.
---
They’re totem type thingies..
---
 (technical term lol)
---
1500 + max carry weight.
---
240 carry weight = 1740 hard weight cap
---
... not with words.
---
Agreed - but on the other hand, sometimes Bethesda's bugs work in our favor.  Last night I was at Whitespring and someone had already nuked the area. I took a pic of the Sentry for the Robotics quest but also triggered the "(something like) take a picture of another player while naked in a nuked zone".  But my avatar was clothed and in PA.
---
Unless they hacked my webcam...
---
Anyone tested it?
---
Thats right my bad
---
laser Gatling?
---
You bought a skin for an item you can't craft. There is no need be so abrupt with the replies you are getting - it's your own fault, sorry this makes you mad.
---
With regard to your account, and the fact that you can't log in.....RESET THE DAMN PASSWORD LIKE EVERY OTHER HUMAN BEING ON EARTH WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION.
---
*ahem*
---
Anyhow, happy crafting.
---
And how do you server hop? Nobody on my friends list plays, so I end up returning to the same empty server more often than not.
---
This is a complete lie. Charisma doesn't affect drops. I run a bloodied build and i have more than 20 charisma and it's still very low drop.
---
I mean, he is not wrong.
---
Why don't they use Starched Genes? Curious.
---
It was all going super awesome til that Staff Sergeant blew the transmission up.  I knew guys who were there and they said that Jessie James was PISSED!
---
If you want to use heavys, I suggest a normal Lazer because your strgnth perks are being used for melee
---
That's true. I check the challenges just about every day so it didn't take me long, but I can see how it could be tough to figure out at first. I don't think there's been a quest that requires challenge tracking outside of the pipboy before this.
---
It's BS, don't help spreading  it.
---
10/10
---
Start selling serums on your machines.  Win/win!
---
Does it need to be "viable"?
---
Always struck me as a fun novelty, not useful.
---
I have my camp set up in (for today, maybe even this week) the perfect location, but it's boxed into a small canyon and *very* shoehorned into the space.  Even if I had a successful blueprint of the place, I'd be really surprised if I could get it back in and lined up in a way that allowed me to place it again.  And the only way to know would be to destroy it and take a chance.
---
For as much time as I spend in game (not all that much), I still get a decent number of shoppers considering how far out into the boonies I am, so I'm not really willing to take that risk right now.
---
Still, seems a bit cold and heartless, but guess you're right :/
---
I understand that. I think if anything as bit as that was ever added, they would advertise it as a new event or something like that. Because not many people decide to risk wasting their time for the possibility of something changing.
---
Do you ever use superduper? Does it proc enough to matter? I only have one level of it so far, it hit once in 15 batches last time I made ammo.
---
LOL. Whatever works, right?  I wasn’t crazy about crafting a metric ton of fuel when it took 20 units to down a level one Mr. Handy.  That’s when I tested the bashing theory with the flamer in hand.  This might be useful for anything that requires a certain item in hand; not just weapons.
---
As far as tadpole challenges go, I found athlete, Archer, and hunting to be the easiest. I got them done in two 2-4 hour play sessions
---
One evening, focusing my eyes on hand written note, triggered my migraine. I couldnt play for two days.
---
The person will fast travel to where the C.A.M.P unit was initially placed at the site.
---
Not sure. I wondered the same thing
---
Think of shotguns for example. If a shotgun deals 300dmg, that’s not per projectile. That’d be 300x7. I can guarantee my combat shotty does not deal anywhere near 2100 dmg/shot. 
---
One weird thing though, is my TSE Harpoon gun. I have flechettes on it (makes it kinda like a shotgun) and the damage on it is 2458. 
---
However, a normal explosive flechette harpoon gun (just one less projectile) deals about 1800. That’s almost 700 damage difference for a single projectile. I have no idea how that all works. Something is broken for sure
---
$14.00 USD for a Skin for your PA. Am I just getting old here, that seems like a lot of money.
---
Then MOVE
---
Which badge requires you to MAKE pemmican? Are you playing non-English version of the game, cause that could be just incorrect translation?
---
Yeah in that case of Fasnacht event i can relate because thats what i did either back then, in mind that there is a danger for the event to fail on a matter of protection and i think the for all it is more than appreciated doing so.
---
All in all thx for your time to break it down!
---
Be ready for the Bethesda nut huggers to down votes you.  This company is a joke putting out buggy software.  In the programming world,  they'd be jobless.
---
Mine has been stashed for ages because my 1* bloodied handmade by far outperformed it.
---
Might have to dust it off!
---
Actually A lot of people do not like PVP, and the mechanics were shit. I should not be killed all the way across the map because I own a workshop. People were abusing the shitty mechanics to be dicks. And with survival, there is no reason to have PVP outside of workshops in adventure.
---
Haven’t gotten to doing the serum thing as I don’t use mutations. I use my caps to buy every plan I don’t own at the moment.
---
u/jessBethesda
---
 This is because of your camps location, no doubt. They have to have some static encounter locations, it's just your luck to have chosen one to camp on. Move your camp. Bethesda is not going to change a static encounter location on a single player's complaint. The game is set to generate an encounter of some type when a player arrives in the area. My camp does the same thing, but with brahmin. Someone shows up, new brahmen. If they changed that mechanic, there would be far fewer enemies to fight.
---
They should seriously be using starched genes if they want to keep their mutations. As a courtesy for “those kinds of people” I’ve installed a switch for my shower and just turn it on when I’m de-radding and off when I’m done.
---
what is up with the stimpak diffuser? Is that a thing in the game?
---
you can't
---
If it wasn’t for the rng there would be no excitement to it just a bunch of 3* BE weapons
---
I spilled coffee down my shirt and I'm out of milk.
---
Well, at the very least, we got a shit-ton of flux out of it. The club is thinking of doing this every weekend as well, so all-in-all, the only problem I had with doing this was that I got a shitty receiver out of it.
---
PSA: you can scrap your unwanted legendary items and get scrip in return. You can find the machine at every train station.
---
I completely agree.
---
My camp is next to a high level spawn. I can get killed in a couple hits while I'm crafting out of my power armor, so I have my door locked. You want it unlocked? Let me craft in PA. I do leave it open when I leave, but anybody could come along and close it.
---
Did you add me on ps? I can’t remember.
---
oh riiiiiiiiiiiight
---
I used to be, but with every new addition, I have to scrap something elsein my base first.
---
Well tbh, if you play at peak hours (evening on a weekday) you'll have the best luck server hopping. There's a limit on your friends list so trying to use that to server hop would never work. Where you live might also be important, the game is dead af at 3 am because either there aren't a lot of international players or it's got me stuck to an NA server.
---
Actually just found out about this today so I have no idea. Maybe I could spend a couple days just farming steel and lead and fully level that up and my chemist perk
---
About half
---
Anyone in this thread planning to do a planned "Encryptid Event", we can discuss and define who gets to be a conduit and what weapons to use in order to complete the event faster.
---
I dont think everything is duped.  Just trying to think of shit that would be ridiculous for weekly and daily challenges is all.
---
I believe you can sell items to a vendor to get you under weight, which will allow you to trade items to a friend/other mule, then buy the items back. You’ll lose caps doing this, but it’s that or destroy things.
---
Yes :) 3 x 1000 scrips waiting for the vendor &lt;3
---
you all got the same loot?
---
I've got one more damage perk, then my build will be maxed. I'm going to test it after that, since I always need 5mm.
---
Yeah my base is already loaded down with like 8.6 billion succulents
---
I had a problem with finding magnifying glass, really hard to find. White fedora from encryptid event counts for everything. Bones i have farmed from supermutants. Almost all of them for some reason got some. Fossils pics- ive got that by Wavy Willards Water park, just a little south east of it.
---
Why? The equipment you use and the environment we are in plays a big role in this. I play in my living room and if it’s sunny it can be really hard to navigate at night or in dark caves. It’s hardly a joke to suggest some of the control is in your hands
---
Nope they included it in the challenge, but its not in the game yet. Coming in a future update lol
---
I'll have to try specifically at those times then. I just got back in the game two days ago after quitting the day patch 5 released, so I have a lot of catching up to do.
---
&gt; Harder for the corruption to be out of control when everyone from the top down has to contribute.
---
You mean like how Bernie Sanders was expelled from his commune because he never worked?
---
Way to meaningfully contribute to the discussion!
---
The truth hurts sometimes. It's called life and facts. Now take your hurt feelings and move on.
---
To answer your question though, I call it like I see it and your feelings don't factor into it for me.
---
The Enclave flair blends perfectly with that comment.
---
Anything new?
---
Plasma flamer is the highest dps rifle in the game, with bloodied effect it goes up to 300+300 dmg per tick with buffs up and the fire rate is about 10 per sec. It only suffers against sbq because of energy resistance double dipping with ballistic but that's about it, everything else it literally melts.
---
on the road right before you get into flatwoods if you are coming from the north.  It's random what the group will be, i've seen cats, rabbits, mole rats, mongrels and possums spawn there.  Another good place is the little pond by the lumber mill near vault 76, it'll either be rabbits or chickens.
---
It's the random pause... in speech where it... isn't always necessary.
---
Bloody MODUS
---
Bethesda being Bethesda i bet 10 caps that the decorative junks you put to your camp will be all over the place every time you fast travel there is even slightly touch them. Like it was in FO4 without mods.
---
I agree that the queen is the only real enemy boss we have and the rewards for killing her are very disappointing.
---
Yeah, it’s happened to us before. We once all got an automatic pipe prime receiver, if you can believe that.
---
Happens to me with any consumible from time to time, mostly with food though.
---
I set a hotkey for food/water, as it seems game will only crash if you consume them from the pip boy.
---
Install the ones you pick up so that different people have different games available??
---
Found this out a couple of days ago. Had to destroy my living quarters to sell more stuff.
---
I can totally craft that for you if you give me the mats, I make 180 at a time for my Gatlin Gun. Which is new to me I'm usually a rifle guy. I got a 3 star Bloodied from the Sheepsquatch event. My first event home run ever.
---
This is why our group power leveled every mule on every members account to be at least level 25 with excavator and calibrated shocks. Put every point into strength. So figure 400 plus 1500 is 1900. But with the reduction perks. Like say junk for example in reality junk was really 5000lbs but we could cram it down to let's say 1800. Its alot of work but you get better gear than most and the positives outweigh the negitives. But it's work. It's not fun. It's work.
---
Its to eat pemmican not make it for the challenge. The recipe doesnt exist
---
Few things, and a free carpet
---
I don't know, I hope it's like the OCDecorator mod from FO4 where all the junk you place is static
---
True.  I really need to get some fancy lettering.  😎
---
Scrap a 3* Legendary during a rad storm with an ally taking a picture 5 times.
---
AdventurE is fine keep y'alls rules but in survival leave it alone its a wasteland not a friendly place at all.. All fallout games have been about mostly robhimg killing and siding with some side I'm just aayimg survival mode should stay what it was
---
That's not how decoration will work. We are going to be limited to display stands and cases which interact with our stash just like the punch bowl, fermenter, vending machines etc.
---
I sell 12 of them at 500 caps each. I make 10k a day. Serums have finally turned into a goldmine.
---
Factual isn't abrupt. It's just short. The post isn't for you, it's for Bethesda. They read it daily. It's someone job to read it.
---
If I was able to do all the normal things people suggest, I would. I'm not a child. I didn't post here as a first resort. Who would?
---
PS resetting passwords requires them to send you an email, which they never do.
---
I don't raid but it does make it less exciting when people have to ask for me to unlock the door so they can attack me
---
it would have to be most likely, otherwise they would have to rework how the entire drop system works
---
Beautiful, beautiful.
---
You okay dude?
---
I was actually thinking about it. Really interesting idea.
---
Ohhh behave
---
Do people still have capped internet in 2019 ? That's such a 2005. I mean, my mobile network offers me 100 GB of internet traffic each month. I probably have more internet on my phone. How does that make sense?
---
Is it the *true* orange shag carpet?
---
Ah, gotcha.  With the current updates, I don't think your idea would do the trick sadly.  ☹
---
i would like to see a video
---
It's only $14 if you haven't saved up your free atoms.  Plus there are tons of challenges that you could quickly farm for some atoms.
---
Sure did: PSN Heirmes
---
I like the fluidity of products coming / going at any moment and at any price.  
---
What I don't like are the awkward moments when you and a couple other dudes all fast travel into someone's camp at the same moment just as they exit. - AKA: Impromptu unexpected pickle party..
---
I think a solution is switching it back to kills and only and have it reset when you die in PVP or if you pay a bounty of half the caps you earned from the kills. This way suicide does nothing and you can still get off the leaderboard if you want to.
---
Damn I didn't even think about that, I hope it's not like that lol
---
Dude. Couple points. You hunted down and replied to my  _month old_ post. And replied to it. To call me a liar. 
---
Fucking why, dude? One, why the fuck would I lie about my experiences with specific locations. What does that net me? Who the fuck besides YOU is going to hunt down a month old post?
---
And why the fuck are you replying to a month old post with bullshit to begin with?
---
what is max
---
If you folks are using the Save Everything mod, be sure to update it. It was causing crashes until the update three days ago.
---
I’m at 991. Rip.
---
I think those are people that can't form their own opinions and require other individuals to tell them what to like and what to hate. If you already OWN the game why would you waste time on a forum instead of starting and testing for yourself?
---
I'm at 700, had to leave town for my son's graduation
---
no
---
No. Unyielding and bolstering are both primary effects. That means only one can be on a certain piece of armor.
---
Not all the time. People spawn at 2 different locations at mine.
---
But why?  It serves to benefit no one.

I’m going to send you a ps message so I remember.

---
Yeah it's funny the C.A.M.P. is meant to be mobile (which is it) but I have the feeling a large portion of the player base (me included) finds a nice spot and never wants to leave. 
---
However, once you get familiar with most zones - you'll notice there is always a crafting table somewhere nearby. Sucks when you can't find it. 
---
Basically it sucks when you're in the field - full encumbered and can't find a damn crafting table. Having a TENT would be very convenient instead of having to either back-track, or fast-travel from my base back to the zone that I am in (at the cost of time and caps).
---
I always know when a customer is approaching my camp because the missile turrets start going off, shooting Ticks or Suoer mutants or whatever they spawned in.
---
No, they are both prefix modifiers, you can only have one.
---
I picked up a spare, if you still need it and on Xbox  I’ll give it to you for free.
---
Sub-PSA: you only get credit for the base recipe amount for crafting challenges, so if it says 50, you're going to have to do more than three batches.
---
Almost there:)
---
Rubbish lol... I whipped his ass at level 35 and then again at level 98. Yes it does seem to find you pursues you but with the right weapons..I had a grognak axe..I smashed him lol
---
Man, you are going to get so many Nocturnal Lead Pipes!
---
830 here
---
I thought so, thank you!!
---
Hope so
---
First things first.
---
The system is broken, not my camo location.
---
Nice 👍
---
Ps4
---
At some point, there were only " is the game worth now" and " can someone die in water plz" posts around here
---
I worked it out by setting up a more secure DNS connection, thanks for the help.
---
It is going to be like that.
---
The good: The compass pip for my CAMP is juuust within range of Encryptid, so it becomes a thriving (if short-lived) player hub after every event.
---
The bad: I've had visitors murder five tamed animals so far (RIP to two Deathclaws, a Snallygaster, a radtoad and a doggo). Now, any asswipe who eats my pets now gets eaten themselves.
---
I wanna become a raider after seeing this
---
I'm almost there but I'm also holding alot of 3* for when the vender comes and I can earn it and spend each day.
---
It might be more efficient to go for 2* weapons, but I honestly don't mind paying extra for 3*. Weight reduction, faster reload, resistance while aiming/reloading are all very helpful as far as I'm concerned. Especially if I can get a god roll on something like a pipe revolver that doesn't exist as a legendary yet
---
PS4? Invite :)
---
I feel like this is supposed to be a sarcastic way of saying that I am putting out info everyone knows but tons of people dont know this so maybe I'm wrong and you are actually trying to help people.
---
shiiit dawg
---
I'm betting on rolling pins
---
Thankfully you can use the quantum skin for free if you want to retain the x-01 looks
---
Dupers are the reason not simply playing the game.
---
I was a bit pissed off that one was only available for femme’s.
---
Yea that equals a couple of run in WS that's it. It will only take 20 years to get the 20 atoms for the 7600 hour challenge, sounds about right.
---
I'm on Xbox, I have 2 other characters stuffed to the gills with stuff, iv been buying cheap legendaries from vending machines to fill my daily scrip lol
---
This is outstanding; thank you!
---
Agreed. I prefer the standard look. As far as which to pick first? That was a far tougher choice. Took armor first cuz I run melee and am always looking for more ways to buff my DR
---
Very cool. Nice work
---
Nice store you have here, it's be a real shame if something were to happen to it...
---
Blaming the system. Typical.
---
are you for fucking real I JUST bought the Mothman Billboards at full price and NOW they go on sale? guys wtf come on
---
also we need a patch asap pioneer scouts messes up building hardcore
---
yea 3 more 1\* armors and you are ready for 16th :)
---
Seriously, why the fuck are you here dude? Information on the legendary vendor _didn't fucking exist_ at all when I made this post. What's broken in your head?
---
Yeah, really nice QOL addition.
---
r/76raiders
---
So good. I love how you worked it into the existing elements.
---
I completely agree. In fact before they changed it from player kills Bethesda created an official poll asking players what they thought the leaderboard should be based on, a strong majority responded with keep it as kills for very good reasons... I guess that wasn't the answer they wanted..
---
I've noticed a majority of the players have set-up elaborate defenses to combat these instances.
---
I've heard that when the vendor gets destroyed, you have to reprice every item - I FT'd to a guys shop with no defenses - I cleared out the hostiles before purchasing, but I'd imagine there are players who just beeline out of there without a care for buddies stuff. 
---
Yeah I don't think it should be as simple as a player FT to your shop. As a new player, I use people's shops as a way to traverse the map faster, so sometimes I'm not even interested in buying anything - and yet enemies automatically spawn.
---
Yes that makes sense to bring real world politics into our silly video game world. Turd wagon.
---
It's an online game that requires server upkeep and the funding of content updates.
---
What the fuck else should they do?
---
A few things is putting it lightly.  The pale Rider power armor skin, the blood raider excavator power armor skin, orange shag carpeting, tinfoil outfit, mole minor stash, skull face mask, three different raider decorations, The two thumbs up emoji is on sale, and the backpack with the shovel skin.
---
Ye, my feels even more when i noticed how bad it is shaped on bald head. It looks terrible. Gotta walk in dark.
---
Did you check electrical lines??? Squirrels love running on them!! If that dosent work try the trees. They love running up and down trees!! If that dont work well i guess your going to have to take a picture of some roadkill
---
It increases gains, but it does not count for challenges.  If you're only making film for challenges, not for pictures, don't use Ammosmith.
---
Not sure how well it works on consoles, but on PC I just press 5 for nuka cherry heals in the middle of a fight, 1 for superstims when everything goes bad, or 2 for diluted stims when I just need to heal crippled limbs but am not really hurt.
---
You're obviously just arguing for the sake of arguing, its pathetic.
---
Short and factual can also be perceived as pretty damn rude. Remember that we're the community here, and bear other people's perceptions in mind.
---
As to Bethesda having someone whose job it is to read Reddit....no. I previously worked at EA, and knew all of the community managers, and in no way shape or form did they have the bandwidth to scour every post - they looked at trends and reported back serious concern or dissatisfaction.
---
FYI, I have never had an issue with Bethesda resetting an account password. If you're not receiving the emails, it's likely you set up your account with an incorrect email address. Check that first, then when you log in, raise a ticket.
---
Op was part of them I guarantee it, now that he can't easily spawn kill he's upset. That's what it boils down too, "they have the same stuff I do because of the dupers and its not fair that I can't one shot them only".
---
Oh yeah that's not what I saw, must've been a snallygaster cuz that sounds familiar
---
Fuck me I just signed offfffffff
---
Yes, I is a n00b; this is for checking out 2+ \* legendaries that are up for sale?
---
We did have the information a month ago, it just wasn't widely circulated yet. Why are you so salty? If you don't want people to respond to what you say, don't post it online 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ Looks like something here is broken, and it's not me.
---
I wasnt in the game atm
---
so ican wear any other female hair but the one i bought RIP
---
Some random dude looked up a month old post to insult me for zero reason. Yeah, i'm a bit salty.
---
First come, first served.  It might take a bit of server hopping to actually find it.
---
I was able to pick it up on my first go, but a lot of people haven't been so lucky.
---
This is honestly the thing i want the most for this game. It'd make it so much better and shouldn't be too hard to implement
---
I like it!
---
Also, some indicator as to what kind of equipment they're selling.... at the very least I don't want to teleport across the map if the vendor in question has a bunch of non-legendary armor/weapons.
---
Yeah, what ever happened to color blind mode?
---
"Harvey being Harvey, though, is full of surprises! Wasn't a *month* gone by before he had ascended the ranks and was a proud Master Baiter!
---
Rose and I didn't have the heart to tell him that he really shouldn't continue telling everyone in town what his job title is..."
---
Or drills maybe!
---
At work, is there a timer nearing an end? I will leave...'sick' if need be.
---
It is and you're not wrong. I spent the $20 for the Tricentennial and then another $14 for the Nukashine paint just, [so I can slap as much golden shit on my PA](https://i.imgur.com/OyoXSpx.jpg). 
---
It costs a pretty penny, but damn I look good. Fuck it, it looks real good. 
---
Anyway, I don't think I will spend more money on Power Armor paints because I don't find the current Horsemen not to be appealing at their current price. I mean, I'd rather they have a bundle, where you can buy them now at a discount for the bundle, like 3 for the price of 4. I am not spending Atoms on them now, and I will not spend Atoms when the Horsemen return.
---
I think the current price structure for FO76 is poor value. I play a MOBA, Heroes of the Storm, and a new hero was released. You can unlock heroes with gold/crates or buy them. New heroes typically get released as a bundle with chroma skins + associated mount (bundle only), but 
---
You can reduce the price of the bundle by owning some pieces. For example, [my initial cost for the new bundle was reduced](https://i.imgur.com/oF8PA2f.jpg) because I already own his base character. My point being, I could swallow bundles more than buying pieces individually, but FO76 doesn't reduce price for owned pieces.
---
I'm hoping it's for data collection to see all the ways in which the current pvp is out of balance... The nerf to the armour effects that reduce player damage is a good start.
---
Hope you put up some defenses. That’s a spawn point for the sheepsquash
---
In all honesty, I agree that you have the right to not care about someone’s feelings, and I appreciate that you gave your opinion in the first place. I just don’t think it’s cool how you turned the situation into something it was not. Those nine hours were on a weekend, where the club had really nothing to do. You may think I feel otherwise because of how I worded it, but if anything, i just made it overly dramatic because I thought a bit more fun and easy to read. I just wanted to share a story, but you had to be an asshole.
---
Glad you liked it! Possibly, the instrumental was a pain to work with I had a few different ones I toyed with but aligning the vocals for the 2nd and 3rd hooks were becoming a challenge
---
In 4 the mounted animal bits required parts from the correct animal; I was kinda disappointed they changed the requirements for taxidermies in 76.
---
Do you not know how to run mules? With that much stuff you should have 10 mutation recipes just from cap dumps.
---
Yes. I picked that one too. It was tough between that and rad resist.
---
Why though? It seems like a waste not to use Super Duper and Ammosmith...
---
No part of what I said was insulting. I literally just said "hey, this is how this works". Your post showed up in my feed, probably because of the volume of responses, and it interested me so i also responded. That's how reddit works. If your skin is to thin, maybe don't post in public?
---
all night long no you need a rank or two of fireproof in endurance
---
About time :)
---
Scrap a 3* BE handmade and a set of ass/Sent combat armor, the one challenge that would never be done!
---
it does not say, but im sure it will be there for a couple days. I wouldn't wait tho haha once you get home get that sh*t!
---
Instance them, removing the server load and letting us make them as big or complex as we want. Above ground all you see is a door and stairs, or even a hatch.
---
we arent talking about if you are getting glare from your windows, we are talking about in game
---
you know what? nevermind, im over this pointlessness
---
Unfortunately It's still very common in a lot of places due to both lack of competition and regulation.
---
I tried just now and no dice :(
---
Mind you, the stash in question was a Whitesprings Trash Can style one if that makes any difference. I looked at the stash before going to the machine, couldn't inspect, exited, looked at stash again and back to the vend-0-tron... no worky
---
That's not the current duping scheme that I've heard about, though it's certainly possible that there is more than one active.
---
Literally just hit it. RIP.
---
Oh hell yes, I will speed the breakdown lane after work for sure! Thanks for the heads up!
---
The longer I play the sadder I am that the responders are a bigger deal to most people and the more I hope we get more out of them
---
I seriously had a great laugh today going through some people's stores and seeing the prices. It's as though they expect the wasteland to be filled with millionaires. 
---
But hats off to the guy with tge super cheap ammo and wastelad holo, you were my hero today.
---
scary thing is the carpet started out as white...
---
I do, because I use tons of film.  But if people ain't takin' pictures, it's more junk taking up space.
---
Honestly didn’t think that I would like player vending, it just seemed dumb. I have not been playing for a few months, just cause I had gotten tired of stability and other issues ( Motion Blur) cough cough. Moving right along this weekend I got to play a few times, and for some reason I actually was having fun traveling from player vendor to player vendor looking for good loot at a good price. It is something that’s very small that adds a whole to and fun element to the game.
---
i got a good spot that never gets taken at least for me. just south of sugar grove is a cliff next to a watch tower, it has a ark of rocks. it over looks the bog twords watoga. when a nuke drops on prime you get a good view, when it rains in the bog or mist settles in the whole land leading to watoga is filled like a bowl. its beutiful
---
I play the german version. Although not all texts are translated, this one is. It say "Bereite Pemmican zu (0/15)" which translates as: "Prepare (or cook) pemmican". Under no circumstances it translates as "Eat Pemmican" What is the text in the english version? Is it really a completely wrong translation?!
---
*Hilarious* poster edit aside...   
---
I have the outfit and I love it on my lady character. I lack the helm, do want it, but just wouldn't look as cool when wearing it as I do now :D 
---
I'm just not sure Bethesda has a firm grasp on what sort of stuff should be in game, and in the Atom Shop... Because that "Fanatics" costume should've been another drop alongside the current Mascot one, and THIS one be what was in the Atom Shop!   
---
*(Don't get me wrong, I'm super pleased it isn't the case, but if we want 76 to stick around, we gotta tell them how to entice people to buy Atoms! The new Black Plague power armor had gotten me to finally spend money, after having gotten everything else since December, through using only earned Atoms!)*
---
i giggled
---
As someone with a few mutations, I have absolutely NO idea why you wouldn't invest in both empowering them (class freak, possibly strange in numbers) and KEEPING them with Starched Genes! Seriously, is min-maxing your luck perks so important that you not only risk getting an unwanted mutation or losing a great one by accidentally walking through a decom?
---
Seriously, I bought the Welcome Friends Lit Sign and the Mothman Neon Billboards last night WTF
---
At 994 because armor doesn’t do multiples of 5.
---
If you're on PS4, I have about 10 spare hardened mass, selling at sticker price, and the same in glowing mass.
---
It used to be at launch than people complained. I liked it. Made me jump when you walk up on something. Made for better tension.
---
I'd make all hair, poses, and picture frames free. After all we use all these to post our pictures on line giving Bethesda free advertising. Least they could do is help us out to make them pretty.
---
They're in the programming world.  Don't know much about games do you?
---
This would be neither. It's just how the challenge is interpreted.
---
you can set the sale value to 0 in your vendor. I put treasure maps and a few other things in that way.
---
It's the patch, I have ran into the same problem as you trying to remodel my base. I was just unsure if u was able to do it I'n the past but thanks to you I know I could
---
It's not particularly useful even with those changes, but at least it's not annoying.
---
Some player vendors are selling the plans for the Nuka Quantum X-01 paint.
---
I agree with you about the objectivity in events. Yes it can be really frustrating when it's not possible that someone look on the right side of the screen.
---
Why not? I run it and I'm bloodied.
---
Nope all I really sell are plans and they weigh like nothing. And I have kept both my machines at capacity since they launched.
---
I’ll try it thanks
---
This game falls short in many ways in regards to accessibility. It is not friendly to the visually or hearing impaired, or to those sensitive to unreasonably loud, repetitive noises. Most of these kinds of accessibility options are industry standard and have been for over a decade. The fact that you can't alter colors for those who are colorblind, that there is no zoom feature for notes / terminals, and no text chat for those with hearing disabilities is embarrassing and honestly a huge drag. Some of my best gaming friends have been deaf, and right out of the gate this game essentially tells them to go and kick rocks.
---
Just spent 30 mins trying to do this, we tried him in waste deep water - couldn't revive, him on the shore me in water - could revive but didn't update, him in shallow water - couldn't revive, him a tiny bit in water - couldn't revive.  
---
Gave up, shame it is literally the last one for my tapole completion.
---
Ha, was gonna post and saw this one... yep... 1000, only realised when I got the message that I’d get 0 scrips for sale for the second time... bummer as I’m still at 1429/525 carryweight... ☹️
---
5.56 and ultracite rounds are the only ones that I personally sell for more than a cap a piece. Everything else is just a flat 1 cap per.
---
**"PERCEPTION** = 1 or 3 pts." 3 points so you can have all 3 lockpicking ranks
---
So once you buy one do they apply like skins and are not separate power armor pieces? So does it work if you have a torso with a jetpack?
---
Fair enough.
---
I played the mutation lottery and got a nice selection, no way do I want to spend anymore time sitting in a toxic pool :)
---
how do you return it if you learn it?
---
It’s kinda weird. Sometimes I don’t see it pop up at all, then a couple days ago it started 3 times in an hour. Each time no one else was there when it started, so I couldn’t tell you why it triggered.
---
I found out a way around it. It’s the foundation or floor under it. Remove hat and you can hang a half wall from a roof like before. Then just replace the foundation or floor
---
I also got attacked by a sheepsquatch too lazy to stand up last night. Really hard guessing where his hitboxes were without VATS.
---
Because it will kill you over and over, while doing basically slap damage to your enemies. It is not in the slightest worth it. Well, I notice more because I'm not in PA.
---
I use perk manager... so I can swap cards no problem.  Just cant swap points.
---
thanks will leave mine as is till patch then gah. this happends too often.
---
If it just goes in someone’s inventory they learn it it’s a glitch and it’s getting patched tomorrow I believe so I’d like to learn it ASAP
---
The better question is if anyone will buy whatever it is.
---
Why do they release semi decent updates then always have stupid restrictions. Is it because the engine can't handle it or something? What's the point in making stuff in your vendor go towards camp object limitations. I play 76, but what a joke. Fair enough in survival mode. Come on Bethesda, christ.
---
Sounds like you accidentally equipped your “Disney Princess” perk card.
---
Yeah, can try google or bethesda support site... found kb on it within 10 second google search.....
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44417/~/what-do-i-do-if-i-get-error-code-ce-34878-0-when-trying-to-play-fallout-76%3F
---
Just release that handmade skin already please take my money
---
Found it, but thank you so much for the offer! (PS4 here.)
---
It almost makes you think that a moderator is watching doesnt it? Although I am told there is no way that is possible on our servers it sure seems like it. Every time I am near the glassed cavern, I am swamped with scorched beasts. Not one or two but I end up killing like 10 of them by the time I am done...
---
Did someone kill your puppy when you were a child?
---
i have been debating to have all 3 lockpicking its so difficult to decide because most people say you dont get much benefit from it. As a vet player i loved having lockpicking maxed. Thank you for your input it helps alot. I think i will get it.
---
I've seen 10k as well...all i'm missing are a couple of the lanterns and the donut recipe, but I"m not paying the price of a 3\* legendary weapon for them, lol
---
TSEs now report in the pip-boy as if there are two +20% explosions added, or +32% with max Demo Expert. What it actually does is anyone's guess.
---
Don't tell me this is an atom shop purchase..
---
But 5 x bits of 1* armour @ 3 scrip each = 15 scrip so I scraped 1* armour in stacks of 5 to keep the numbers tidy lol. At 994 you’d only need to scrap 2 bits of 1* armour to have a nice round 1000 and the Whitespring ghouls drop plenty of 1* wood armour lol, and yes I do need to have the volume on my tv resting on an even number what can I say 😂😂😂
---
I just ate one pemmican and I'm still at 0/15 for the challenge... I had slow metabolizer active... might the be a bug with that?
---
IV never had it kill me, I do notice that it doesn't work very much when I'm not in PA tho. Maybe I'm missing something but i haven't had any issue running it.
---
 A rather huge hole in your Mutations. Twisted Muscles for +25% melee eh'. ;)
---
I've played 280 hours and I bet I've been rewarded a max of 2,500 - 3,000 atoms. The challenges are very tedious for their reward. You’re not going to change my mind and I’m not going to change yours so just leave it be.
---
having all slugger perks gives me a total of 60% dmg. Its makes sense as its a two handed melee build. no?
---
yep, every now and then PC
---
But then the Oompa-Loompa Nation attacked
---
That and it would be nice to be able to mail items to our other characters, again like WoW.
---
I ate one pemmican and it doesn\*t count. Still at 0/15. Is there a bug with slow metabolizer?!
---
Just happened to me today in fort defiance. Last mole rat before I got to the objective room. Got tired of wasting ammo and just let it kill me. I’m on level 19 so I try not to waste. Pretty annoying.
---
Go behind Grafton Steel, there’s a huge drop off on the back of the building then one stand in water below in the shallow end and the other takes off armor and jumps down next to you. That’s where I got it done. You both have to be in water.
---
Agreed. Slippy the second needs some breathing room.
---
Same dude if anyone is willing too I will pay 1k caps
---
Jesus,are you crybabies still whining in here? My god,get over it.
---
Obviously you've dug into the code and saw that no additional changes had taken place since a month ago.  Given that you're that familiar with the way the game operates, would you mind telling us why you feel justified in being an ass?
---
Just curious.
---
Yes. Very random. Sometimes I can play for hours and no crashes. Sometimes I've been playing 5 minutes and first consumed item = crash.

The potion was craftable, but only if RNG gave you the material you needed to craft the potion (or you bought it from the AH). You're just moving the reliability from one place to another, it was likely worse in EQ when mobs only had a chance to drop an item, and their spawn rates were atrocious, or on EQ2 where the rare materials for potions only had, at best a 2% chance of appearing off their nodes.   
---
And I agree, many of the benefits are minor and wouldn't make any difference in the long run.  A +2 in most stats won't make a difference, especially since many perks have built in caps to the benefit gained from your stat increase. I don't think people would use those though - Given the choice of a +20% damage to a weapon type your spec'd too, a +2 stat bonus, or +15 radiation resistance, which one would you choose?  Would you ever choose anything other than a straight +20% bonus to the weapon of your choice. 
---
I could be wrong, but from observation of the builds people have presented and what people focus on for weapons, I still strongly think that unless it was changed people would simply grab the +20% damage bonus, people MIGHT switch for some specific situations, but in general it would be easiest to just slot that damage bonus and be done with it. They would have to nerf them in order to balance them.  
---
it's all perspective I guess: for me, consumables have some freedom in being overpowered, since they are temporary.  Yes, some bobbleheads and magazines are disappointing to find and are simply used for the challenges, but other ones are nice to find.  For me when I get that magazine that does something like -25% damage from robots does feel exciting, since it's 60 minutes (with curator) of a boon against robots.  Finding the one that makes turrets deal an extra 50% damage is exciting since it could be that little extra edge if I need to defend my workshops.  
---
In any case, I'd rather they ADD features to the game than remove or dramatically change the ones we currently have.  We have magazines, but we don't have skill books - they could add those.  We could keep bobbleheads as consumables AND add functionality with the eventual display case so that your "prized poession" gives you a boon - so you can display one STR bobblehead and get a small bonus and extra STR bobbles can be consumed for their own benefit.  As long as they don't make the content too easy, and they plan for it - nothing says we can't have both.
---
Indeed, you get a point there i also think that some events is more about working together, help were help is needed and not blow it for all folks. Thats the worst what could happen.
---
Did I miss something? Do we get a trophy if we hit 1000 scrip? 😂😂😂
---
I never had turrets at my camp before vendors, and I had a spawn nearby.
---
Now I built three and not only are they taking up precious built budget they couldn’t hit an elephant from 10 paces.
---
Unless you're hoarding junk, in which case you have a real problem, you don't have alts carrying literally tons of equipment without dupers being in the equation somewhere. You may not do it, and you may not know who does, but some of that equipment, somewhere, somehow, involved duping.
---
I have a level 4 trader with 1k lbs worth of stuff. If you see low level characters who can only walk you should probably check out what they have. And you will never catch people duping unless you know how they do it.
---
Aid stuff I tend to sell for like 5-10c, depending on what it is. Ammo, I sell all types for 1c....had a guy buy out all my .44 the other day for 2k,
---
I've also sold other stuff, like Mothman wing(100c), teddy bears (5c) and other stuff for the Possum Badges...that stuff really goes.
---
so the shock damage you get back is mitigate from your PA and of course from Class Freak which theoretically if everything works correctly is peanuts compared to the actual damage out put from the effect but there is not telling as i haven't explored.
---
If youre on XBOX, I got ya GT Dookieinyourhat
---
No... you mad bro, seems you're getting all hot under the collar, or is it the strong drink?
---
The possum challenge only requires you to eat 3 pemmican.
---
I’m a child of the 70s. This ugly assed carpet = home.
---
GT Dookieinyourhat if on xbox
---
Damn. We went a step too far. We wore hazmats, waited til the person taking the pic was ready, unequipped snap equip. Maybe took a rad. Apparently we didn't even need to do that.
---
I sold mine for 12.000 caps. Respect for those that grind for hours and give it for free !
---
No. Enemies spawning on fast travel is how I destroy CAMPS.
---
Don't like it? Get good.
---
I'm happy, I've got a slew of communist posters.  
---
"Their war machine is mobilizing, let's prepare ours!" (comrades)
---
"Be vigilant, communism is coming!" (our day comes soon)
---
"Communism is at your door." (so put together a nice lunch, and we'll plan the defeat of our capitalist oppressors)
---
I'd suggest getting radicool in case you're going for a bloodied build. Also you don't need that much intelligence. You only need the perk which allows you to repair up to 200%. Power armor breaks very, very slowly and you can get fusion cores just by killing the sentry bots in whitesprings. And since melee weapons break very slowly as well you don't need rank 5 of makeshift warrior. I'd put at least one point into adrenaline the dmg boost you get just from one perk point is insane. Also why not get twisted muscles if you're a melee build?
---
Do ticks spawn as part of the attacks? That's interesting if so
---
Like our dude hasnt got the time to hoard 3 star legendaries, that is just suspicious, friking duper.
---
i actually forgot to add it lol thank you. i should add that now.
---
You're doing the lord's work - thank you for this.
---
Only if you hit 1000 while wearing a tin foil hat and otherwise naked, in a nuke zone accompanied by Graham 😂😂😂
---
This a million times.
---
It killed me once but I still like it cuz it staggers gouls when they sneak up from behind.
---
So many soft babies out there these days. Filling up my block list lol.
---
You guys are so......  TRIGGERED
---
HAHAHAHAHA!
---
Sorry should’ve mentioned PS4
---
 I've tried em' all and I just use Combat Knives as they are so much fun and can be so OP.
---
 Even Medium weapons are just so slow to get anything dead. All those long waits for another swing allow all kinds of stunning attacks that I seldom experience.
---
 Combat Knives FTW! Stabby stabby. ;)
---
Aww boo hoo did your vag get sand in it because I was questioning Bethesda's ability and responsibility to put out a bug free game.  I cant hear your reply with Bethesda's nuts so far in your mouth.
---
Yes, today it happened to me again after a long time. I think it is an extremely random crash because sometime it happens a lot and sometimes it does not for a long time.
---
I'd be so happy if they added in some men in black encounters or lore around Point Pleasant.
---
hey as long as you can keep your carry weight at 180 or lower go for it, otherwise you are just not going to be able to do this
---
Just so I understand correctly: When you say terminals do you mean the terminal that you can use to control lights / switches etc? I'm not sure I have an actual computer terminal in my build menu that can be locked with a password like you encounter while playing.
---
But hopefully not junk lol
---
If your on today send me a message! I’ll add you on PS. The last two days have been busy and I haven’t been on.
---
I beg to differ, I regularly team with a large group of mostly high level 150+ players, level 220+ myself, and we trade a lot of weapons among our group, we also do a lot of legendary Farming, and nearly everyone in our group has gotten multiple 3\* Explosive legendary weapons.
---
Several of my friends consider me very lucky with RNG, but I believe it's simply a numbers game, the more you loot, the better your chances of getting great gear, Sunday was a rainy day at my home so I got in about 12 hours of gameplay resulting in 2 great weapons, a 2\* TSE Handmade, and a 3\* Quad Explosive Double Barrel, this was from roughly 100 drops, and they were the first good weapon drops I had gotten in over a week, but the point is it happens, and the TSE handmade was the 4th one I have gotten from the game.
---
No it isn't, people keep saying it's eat but you eat them and stays 0/15. I play spanish version, changed to english just for this and it stays the same.
---
Maybe recipe is a low rate drop or it isn't in game yet but for sure you have to cook 15 of those for the possum badge to complete.
---
Uhm as far as I’m concerned your the only disrespectful person here
---
You may want to specify what type of build you're looking for?
---
You can also peruse [Fallout builds](www.falloutbuilds.com)
---
Wow. You must be super popular at your middle school.
---
Don't forget Glowing Steak for another 10%. ;)
---
Don’t forget Yao Guai for springs
---
I actually do write my own code, though not video games.  However I understand that if your code is shit, you don't have a job.
---
I think you can only stack one exp buff with sell rested.
---
That sounds like a typical weekly challenge to me. 😀
---
Any idea if this can clear camp budget like scrapping stuff did in FO4?
---
Do the raider decorations all look the same? Or are they different objects?
---
y guess is it's something that has to be "seen" by everyone on the sever, so it has to save the server space. Just a guess though?
---
Yes, I bet its very clean and tidy!
---
Cheer up, dude .
---
Whoa there nelly, calm down. He did NOT insult you, not even close, he said "Respect for those that grind for hours and give it [away] for free". Reading comprehension mate, it'll keep your feet out your mouth.
---
That's an awesome website, thank you for sharing. I guess I wasn't looking for anything in particular, was more curious to see how others play their characters and how they managed their perks. 
---
I know this sub doesn't like dealing with returning players who ask a lot of questions, I just haven't had much luck with finding good resources. Figured Reddit had the experts.
---
So the logic here is:
---
Iamborghinis are OP  because my ford cant keep up. 
---
Shall I work towards getting rich get myself a lambo? 
---
 Should  I stop challenging Lamborghini’s for a race?
---
Noo ...
---
Lets ban Lamborghini’s or nerf the engine
---
Valid response, carry on.
---
I'd like to see mods that let you convert energy weapons to use gamma rounds.
---
I use mainly a mole miner gauntlet, so I have rank 3 iron fist, rank 3 martial artist. When I use power armor, I use two-handed so I switch over to slugger 3 and keep martial artist. I have 15 points in strength and dedicate the rest to carry weight stuff cause I'm a hoarder
---
Items being sold count towards both stash weight and camp budget, so it's weight doesnt necessarily matter.
---
"At tit" -- nice.
---
 Gave a nice level 35 3* Unyielding bit to a level 37 guy at The Whitespring yesterday. Seemed too good to sell to the Legendary machine and so many people want them. He was very pleased. ;)
---
This is my current build (at lv221). See if it gives you ideas :) I had Action Boy earlier and didn't find it useful enough. Same as Power User, it's kinda meh (if you use Lone Wanderer)

It was a great story and it sounds like you played the game! The end result was not quite what you expected but it was the journey?

Okay thanks! I just have super low damage at level 71

Loved the sound of my little frog friend but couldn’t deal with his desperate pleading expression and gasping for air so I had to put him out of his misery and scrap him, poor little guy :(

PVE Heavy Weapons/Tank Build.  I only run Marsupial on this guy.  3 Points Perception for swapping out Picklock cards.  Drop Blocker and pick up 3 more points in Heavy Gunner cards for +50% damage instead of +35% if you want more DPS.  This guy destroys the SBQ.  I seriously think I could solo her alternating between my TSE 50 Cal Machine Gun, Quad Cryolator, and Anti-Armor Faster Fire Rate Gatling Gun (for when she's in the air).

---
There is not much in the way of variety.  It’s basically skulls on pikes.  Not like Nuka World decorations, if you’re into the raider look.  The canopies would have been nice at least.
---
I agree that something doesn’t seem right with the TSE shotgun. I have a level 45 TSE Pump and a level 25 Quad double barrel. TSE is around 350dps while the Quad is at 200dps. I can kill enemies much faster with the level 25 quad than the TSE. 
---
Also agree the damage feels like it has a negative effect. 
---
This is with all of the shotgunner perks too. It’s so bad, I put the TSE Pump back up on the mantle and have converted to and Auto-Rifle build.
---
Player vending has really brought the game to life now, I've met and chatted with so many people these last few days.
---
Inbox me your address or PO Box. No one has come to me so it’s yours. :)
---
Very nicely put. 
---
$14 for a PA skin? I feel like that's objectively expensive. Sure I can earn atoms but even if I devoted a couple hours a day toward it let's be reasonable here. It's just not doable. I really do enjoy this game but at the same time I just don't respect Bethesda anymore. I'm just too goddamn observant and honest with myself. I've spent $25-30 in the Atom Shop but that's stopping now. I'm not spending half of what a new game costs on a few in game skins for my power armor. I would to support them if I felt their motives were noble. Rant aside, objectively expensive. But that's all I'm saying because I don't want to spread my negativity. If everyone else is good with it then so be it.
---
Thanks. Starts game. ;)
---
You bought the skin for the item. That’s your own damn fault for not knowing you buy skins and not the object itself.
---
Actually the irony is... you seem like the triggered one. Look in the mirror sunshine.
---
Im not sure what the @\^\^@R#$ machine is doing? I sell things and my number is going down? but in my PIPBOY it is going up??? I am at 240 in my PIPBOY but the machine says 135 now?
---
It also has a build planner where you can play around with different builds.
---
Lots of questions are cool, as long as it's not another "tell me why I should play" post, lol
---
I can help with bloodied/sneak/VATS builds, as that's all I played extensively with.
---
All the time.
---
There is a ~~bug~~ feature of the vending machines that when you put an item for sale, it seems to duplicate the item in some way, so you have to have enough stash room for an identical item before you can list it for sale.
---
Yeah this is still happening. I just lost mine...
---
Is there a fix yet?
---
Well yeah but if my machine has been full this whole time why would I notice that I have more budget now as opposed to last week.
---
The things we do out of boredom...
---
Grahm would make a good mailman
---
I have crashed many times using radaway from the quick use wheel. Strange enough, I never crashed using anything else from the quick use wheel.
---
You never found the kindling? It pops up on your radar. There's about 4 spawn points. It's easier to see outside of power armor though. And also easier if you have other quest markers turned off.
---
im glad you are pointing all this  out because im relatively new to this fallout edition. I have debated on a few things and my initial build. involved a combination of what you mentioned but the increase damage and sacrifice in quality of life could make a difference? or does it really not matter all that much. if so ill go for the increased damage build.
---
No, that's the Tadpole one. Possum Archeology requires to PREPARE pemmican. As Kastrus2000 said...
---
They are all corpses though...
---
Boredom? I had a blast getting everything for this.
---
That looks bad ass, thank you for sharing. If you ever get footage of you soloing the SBQ i'm trying to see that!
---
Yeah. I though that the poster board thing that is a reward item would allow you to put pictures that you took into the board, and not the already static pictures of various locations.
---
wtf he is not a duper, he just got over zealous with his collecting, calm the f down calling people "part of the problem"
---
If you haven't sold anything, I've got nothin. 😕
---
Yeah, I only plan on keeping him around until the fix the bug.  I find the whole thing a bit disturbing, to be honest.
---
Might be coming from my end, as I still have low-tier weapons. A Vampire Swingspeed two hander or an aa explosive heavy gun would be nice. Once I get those, I might start going or three stars, try for a good VATS focused auto rifle.
---
its ok!!!! what you need to do is build a player vending machine, and then you can sell stuff until you get to your weight limit + 1500 pounds
---
There would be plenty of excitement if things were balanced so there was more than one good build.
---
The stagger effect has helped me alot with enemies behind me, especially scorched as they stagger pretty easy.
---
Exactly my point!
---
The Assaultron tape did mention 'mating rituals' 😥
---
Yeah, people aren't too nice to other peoples pets in this game.  Tames shouldn't be touched.  I can kind of understand the muties, but a doggo.  Chow down for sure.
---
I feel like they messed up on what horsemen they we're basing these armor skins on too.
---
Would do more Point into Agility to get the Adrenaline Skill. 1 Point in it is enough and it will still give u good DMG Boost after u kill a bunch of Enemies.
---
Pick up any Battered Clipboards, lockets, Toys, Toy cars, Typewriters, Phones, and Desk Fans.
---
It's really not that hard, just takes a little Google, tagging, etc. I have like 280 screws and I'm constantly selling a few Bulk gears/Springs to the Vendor for my daily caps.
---
&gt;radicool
---
wow totaly forgot about that.
---
They could even make individual perk cards for energy weapon damage that go in intelligence. There’s already pistols, rifles, heavy guns, shotguns and melee. I always thought it was weird no energy damage perks are in the game
---
I'M GOING WITH THIS ONE.
---
Character #2 - PVE/PVP Automatic Handmade Rifle Hybrid Build.  Very versatile.  Excellent DPS.  Put most of your food/drink/chems in your stash box and swap out Thru Hiker for Dodgy for additional damage reduction or Enforcer if you like to stagger players with an explosive shotgun.

Ok indeed it seems to be a translation issue. The thing is, on spanish, i don't have this line on the Archeology badge:
---
Acquire bones while wearing a fedora (0/15) 
---
And since it's the only with 0/15 and it makes more sense than eating pemmican i think that's the problem.
---
The thing I don't get is why after switching languages I still didn't see that line. Had to browse through a checklist that another redditor made.
---
999 here...the setup effectively limits you to 150 a day / 1 and a half weapon rolls a day...which isn’t a lot tbh...
---
Fark.  I was gonna buy it.  Not if it takes away my beard (which btw is a very poor substitute for my majestic lumberjack beard IRL - come on, Bethesda!).
---
This a great idea and is something we’ve been asking for since launch, it’s such a shame it hasn’t happened yet as it would be a massive QOL improvement. Upvoting for visibility and a hope Bethesda implements it soon.
---

I moved my camp for player vending. Now I have foxes. Two of them. They just chill in my camp. One stands and only even moves his head. The other wanders around, sniffs the ground, lays down... I'm absolutely waiting for the day when someone shows up and shoots them... Hopefully they'll respawn!

They switched up the buttons for regular workbench repairs.  In my opinion, it's super shady to mess with a UI that the users have become familiar with to promote in-game purchases.

The first Tabby, in my experience above, followed me a long enough distance that it *has* to be an intentional in-game behaviour.

I've defended many of Bethesda's more controversial changes because they at least made sense to balance the game.  This one exists simply to try and make money.  I don't want to use repair kits, even if they're given to me for free.  If I was able to, I'd disable them entirely in my game settings.
---
Not me at least. Good luck!
---
If you are trying to contribute to the scorchbeast queen fight as cheaply and easily as possible you should consider a bloodied build, bloodied weapons are reasonably common and there's a \*ton\* of perks, mutations, and PA mods that are aimed at making the bloodied build actually doable.
---
Another quick and easy build is the VATS-based rifleman.
---
The problem with sock puppets is when you trot them out to defend a claim, you are unable to determine that claim is absurd. As such, you reveal your sockpuppet status by supporting a position so absurd it is impossible for two sane people to hold that same position.
---
You know they won't. Remember how the camera dailies weren't fixed until the camera was introduced in the next scheduled patch? Something like two weeks? The purveyor is probably just a time-based trigger; no patch needed.
---
Now, if they'd only get rid of "gender based" hairstyles... open that stuff up for all characters, dammit. If Thag the Destroyer wishes to wear his hair in pigtails... he damn well should be able to.
---
Then play something else with a community that doesn’t think you’re acting like a dick for the sake of it then?

Quick tips for first-time pylon takers from a dedicated pylon god (am I the only one who thinks the handicap makes it more fun?): Lone Wanderer's damage reduction does apply to pylon damage, auto-stim effects from armour or Born Survivor are a literal lifesaver, and cooked Scorchbeast parts heal you faster than pylons hurt you for a good 30-45 seconds or so.

---
If you think this place is a circle jerk, you should check out /r/fo76filthycasuals.  They would probably ban you immediately just for calling it a looty shooty, no joke.
---
Well I cant find them but my point is why make it so deathclaws no longer drop them?
---
Man, I'm jealous of that. My Gatling Gun is a VE weightless I got from harpers ferry. I absolutely love the heals, even knowing I'm giving up some damage. I'm so survivable with it, though. Plus the weightless perk is a nice little bonus. 
---
And thanks for the offer! I actually have my camp on a lead deposit so I'm good on ammo crafting for now. I have a surplus of everything I need to make ballistic ammo.
---
I've been selling my one star armor pieces for 25-35 caps and weapons for 35-50 caps for people to buy and turn in for scripts.
---
Damn straight!
---
Yes i would, cuz thats how i play Melee. I have Maxed Bloody Mess, Radicool and 1 Point into Adrenaline. Still some points in Perception for Queen/Sheepquatch Fights.
---
 No Power Armor to get the Additional Perks from Regular Armor (like Cavalier or something cuz u sprint all the time from Enemy to Enemy). 
---
But thats just preference. PA is also pretty cool, especially with all those New Skins ;).
---
I expect it's a bug. Having the weight count toward your stash *and* the item count toward the camp budget doesn't seem like an intended mechanic -- one or the other makes more sense.
---
The numberless vault is fixed. It's vault 51.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5vmdc/new\_vault\_confirmed\_as\_vault\_51\_door\_is\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b5vmdc/new_vault_confirmed_as_vault_51_door_is_now/)
---
Look dude I'm all about raging against the machine here. The Atom Shop is expensive and they are forcing people to use money recently and it's really getting to me. 
---
But you can't equip a goddamn Hazmat suit and snap a picture for 40 caps? What do you want like? 
---
Daily Challenges:
---
Shoot the side of a building for - 40 caps
---
Jump over a fence - 30 caps 
---
Shoot anything with anything – 50 caps
---
Fast Travel to your camp – 40 camps
---
Wave at another player – 20 caps
---
Earn it, loser.
---
So... I just acquired my 8 Possum badges for the high capacity mod. Bought the plan, went to use it: (Known) Plan. 
---
Is that supposed to be the case? I crafted the mod on two backpacks so it isn't lying. Is this plan effectively 'soulbound', or did I hit a glitch?
---
Yeah that is weird, I found one in a mutant meat sack. So just go west tek, huntersville etc and keep checking the meat sacks.
---
Wooby is the only NPC in fo76 and hes locked in an inaccessible room by himself in case some people don't know.
---
Thats what I mean its weird and like its a noticeable amount of budget I have now I mean before there was no room to add.
---
Cool I see you've found that in the game code, would you mind posting it for the rest of us?
---
If anything, I think it works the other way: I've scrapped camp items that didn't return the same amount of budget they took to build. Moving your camp seems to clear things up, but damn... talk about a nuclear option.
---
Figured out how to place it using the roof tricks in the Reddit post below.
---

I saw another 1 star Bloodied one at a vendor last night for 1.5k. What a time to be alive!
---
Interestingly, the FCC had extended the requirement to meet ADA standards a few times, but the last time extended it to Jan 1 of 2019.  https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/28/fcc-extends-waiver-for-video-game-accessibility-for-the-last-tim/
---
Now, I'm assuming this only applies to new games, released after that date, but hopefully a better gaming world for you going forward!
---
The Purveyor will become available on Thursday.  It's unknown if there will be downtime or not, as she may have been fully added in the last patch and is just waiting to be enabled.
---
Not a bad idea, I think I would need some leverage in the trade like you trade 1k caps and a 3 star legendary for the plans, then we trade the plans and legendary back
---
that will be so cute
---
Yeah trolloloo, of course no one uses the ammo weight perk.
---
That was fixed long ago, and has been thoroughly tested, if you were in pacifist mode and able to be attacked then something else was also in play;
---
* If you are on a team, and a team mate is in PVP mode, once they initiate combat with someone, then you are also in combat with that person and anyone they are teamed with.
---
* If you had possession of a Public workshop, you were also automatically in PVP mode, this was recently changed so that you are only venerable while in the workshop area.
---
It's a bug. You can give it freinds, they can learn it, then give it back.
---
Much, much lower than 25% (or I've been incredibly unlucky) for the new event.  Honestly I'd place it at about 10% as well.
---
No, wooby is my dad
---
You were right pal, it's just that. 
---
They ask for pemmican when they should be asking to pick up bones, hilarious :)
---
I will stick with my commander chubs
---
It's 25% the fact that you were unlucky doesn't change the fact i already have 4 from event ;)
---
Even if they gave the option to zoom in on the text and move it around, that would help. Different color options for the HUD and reticle would be lovely, too. I really have terrible trouble finding that little dot.
---
I'm glad.
---
Got tired of seeing "kill a wendigo in a clown costume" popping up everytime I logged on even though I completed it a dozen times.
---
Why? So he can tell you the same thing a robot does and break the story of the game?
---
I spawned at someone's shop and was getting pegged by a super mutant while browsing. To my surprise it was a 3\* legendary. Luckily the camp only had a low level turret so I had time to get my shots in and get the drop. Nothing fantastic was dropped, but it's nice to have a random legendary show up.
---
The ability to save perk card sets and the select the set you need is one of the more requested items in the forum.  PC players have this through third party add-ons.   Console gamers, however, are at the mercy of Bethesda.
---
my only issue is that if quality of life sucks i may end up getting frustrated so intitalli i opt for INT points. however its hard to know as ive never reached max level. The increased dmg you listed is really making me interested. I may alter the build.
---
Only if you need that extra 60% damage.  If it's overkill most of the time, you don't need it.
---
The average enemy has maybe 500ish health tops at high levels.  If you can one shot that without wasting 6 perk slots, why waste 6 perk slots?
---
Lol. I’d built a janky trailer home under there once. Complete with a plant stuck in the concrete that I could do nothing to remove. 
---
I’ve seen some people find a way to build over the skeleton, but I couldn’t do it myself, so I just had a hallway down that part and I stashed my generator and wiring in there.
---
I started farming my adhesive. The perk that gives you double plant harvesting and then planted a bunch of corn, tatos, and mutfruit.
---
Made it a point to stop back at camp regularly to stock up and craft vegetable starch for several days.
---
"Or there are people that exaggerate how bad something is to make a point. When the other people on a discussion all say x, and you swear its y. Well... you know.". 
---
You came into a month old post. (and it's interesting that it showed up in your feed. I've _never_ had a month old post show up in my feed) You said "hey, you're wrong" and then when I said "no, that's my experience" you accused me of lying. That's an insult. If you don't _get_ why that's an insult, that's not my problem. 
---
On that note, just did YET ANOTHER full clear of the civic center (because it's a GREAT scrap run. 16 adhesive, 70 odd steal, 30 odd lead, 20ish screws, 20ish gears, etc) 
---
Guess how many legendary enemies. Zero.
---
I'd like get in on this too - 
---
I’ve killed 3 and they spawn with purple lightening. I freaked out as level 100 when my screen flashed purple and there was one breathing down my neck
---
Yes this is great. Should have the following:
---
Level floor
---
Cooking pot
---
Bed, sleeping bag or whatever
---
Camp fire
---
Stash
---
1 slot for a table, you can switch it out, but only room for 1. 
---
Maybe an instrument. 
---
Best idea is to have something to be able to drop, scrap, stash. Gets packed up if you leave the area.
---
I’d spend ten badges on one with 100% disease protection. At the end of the day I’ve used more disease cures than stims.
---
Awesome! There’s no place like camp, there’s no place like camp...
---
The fuck is a debuff gun
---
Did they ever fix that Welcome Friends sign, or is it still a piece of junk that's illegible because of so many lights being burned out on it?
---
Seriously, don't buy it until they do. You literally can't make out what it's supposed to say.
---
I don't think I have the recipe for stimpaks on this character yet. I'm also too low level to get super duper. I'll do that when I can though.
---
This is consistently going to happen on the business model that they've provided
---
Get 'em!
---
woah there buddy, you really need to have at least a very basic idea of the sort of character you are trying to build.
---
Perk setups for melee, ranged, heavy weapons, stealth etc are wildly different.  There's no single "ideal" setup it all depends on your play style and approach.
---
Thanks! I knew I saw them before and wasn't on deathclaws themselves.
---
I’ve already got a few mutation recipes from the SBQ drops. Don’t have them all yet but some aren’t very useful I think, like herbivore and herd mentality? I do have mules carrying stuff for me but now since I’m building a second character I’m down to three.
---
Thanks.  I'll try that next time.
---
Oh shit. That’s a brilliant idea. :)
---
now we need a majestic lumberjack beard in fo76
---
Bethesda special forces come out with your hands up!
---
Been like that for a few weeks. It’s like they aren’t resetting after the silo resets.
---
that is interesting point of view that i never thought about. it would open up to having better  quality of life in return. hmmm
---
Ah I need it too.  grimmwerks on PS4
---
Its obviously a joke.
---
It's a fair point and worth trying. Some people may have their monitor or TV brightness too high. It is a shame the game doesn't have its own slider
---
Just funny how they make a total RNG part of a challenge like that.
---
What was that?! 
---
Must be hearing things....
---
It's the easiest way to clear caps. Buy them and resell at half when you need caps. Or buy signs and letters anytime you need to clear room.
---
They're just salty.
---
Hint:  Do Campfire Tales every time it becomes night.  Just show up at the camp fire at night and it starts automatically.  You occasionally get a Badge token.  I was able to get the expanded backpack (cost 8 tokens) only completing I think 3 of the Possum badges.  I'll finish the rest from time to time.
---
i agree with you, not to mention a lot of these challenges are just out of the norm for everyday play. next challenge is like 'stay up till 4am and catch grahm raiding your fridge only to be suprised by spoiled brahmin milk'
---
Hahaha
---
Armor weight definitely has an impact on your stealth ability.
---
Added!
---
Level 3 Terminals are also located outside power plants, they are used for overriding the facility lockdowns.
---
I'm intrigued. Don't suppose if you know whether the Metal helmet is compatible/ if the clipping is too bad?
---
Hi intrigued, I'm dad!
---
Not saying where I camp because I dont want everyone there but I get deer cats squirrels chickens possums frogs and fireflies almost exclusively.  Only thing I have to worry about attacking my camp is bees.  Moved almost a dozen times and keep coming back to this spot because after fighting for hours in the wasteland it's nice to have a cozy safe spot to unwind before heading back out.
---
Congratulations to ZonkerBrainless Jr.!
---
That was the main reason (greater than farming legendaries) I built my camp on whitespring golf course. To be near that fountain.
---
[ danger ]
---
I’m not sure asking someone to realease their woody is appropriate behaviour! 😂
---
That Skull Mask reminds me, I'd love a Masquerade Mask!
---
I have no doubt that a lot of people know what they're doing. They know they're locking you inside and forcing you to either become wanted or eat the travel cost. It's a shitty troll, but some people are jerks.
---
*is secretly emptying your bank accounts*
---
Seems like it would be easier to have personality and confidence in your actions this close to when the bombs fell, with the memories of civilization fresh in everyone's minds. 
---
The Responders remembered what life could be like, and they fought to reclaim what they had lost. The Minutemen worked off of hope for anything better than what the last 200 hundred years were like. 
---
The Minutemen might have heard stories of peace, but they had never truly experienced it before. In a world ran by raiders and psychotic scientists, they operated with fear and trepidation, because that was the wise thing to do.
---
Fasnat witch mask
---
Ya, they've been there since release. Slated to be part of the vault raids coming later. 
---
I have a feeling we'll need to find a body that still has the vault access codes needed to get into vault 94.
---
Here's some info on the vault and it's contents:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_94
---
"Oh but it's meant to be seen at night" - at night, just looks like a scattering of dim lightbulbs.
---
&lt;3
---
I kinda thought it hadn't reset too but then the terminals should have the option to access the turrets but it would say 0 connected.  It didnt even have an option for turrets.  Weird.  Hopefully they put it back, this new setup or glitch if it is sucks.
---
Are you talking on the reddit market or in game? Not much has changed here but in game is what I was referring. The prices are nuts. I saw a guy charging 10c per 2mm. Most of the time people throw that away and I've never had to craft any.
---
Every time you do a silo it will spawn in one of a few different ways.  Heavy turrets and less robots, or no/few turrets and many robots.  One low turret run I had 3 assaultron dominators in just the pipe room.
---
It says wooby
---
Remove camp damage by NPC ,remove condition on items , give us back the saving to camp budgets.
---
Calm down I deleted my own comment cause I misread the other guys post relax
---
How did i miss that. Damn. Thanks
---
God damn I wish I was creative enough to do stuff like you did to the poster.
---
I was able to build a Tree House a few months back using the campfire method and mats partially clipped into the tree, you had to hop from mat to mat to get up to it, about 3 stories high in the tree, but a recent update has now left it permanently unable to place.
---
I hope so.. Or maybe it is part of it and that's why they're making camp limit bigger? Is there any release date for the camp limitation update.
---
Thank you!  Can't believe I didn't know about this before.  I may actually be able to read the notes now!
---
How do you borrow a plan?
---
No patch. Purveyor drops Thursday, simply needs to be turned on. No need for downtime.
---
We will have a patch on Tuesday May 21 however.
---
I want my camp and another camp where I can have a stash, vendor, and a bench
---
This makes sense and actually is kinda cool.  I've never seen it like this before then.  Rng must've been my friend always giving me a similar silo.  Last night No turrets till the launch room and I killed at least 10 assaultrons and 2 sentry bots.
---
I know its just funny not laughing at you its most of the community thats hot to argue!!!
---
Yea maybe camp-building is what I’ll do next and hopefully I won’t get bored too quickly lol
---
I mean it depends on what kind of build you're going for. If you really want a bloodied build you're gonna have to change a few more things. The only quality of life perk i use is travel agent. I don't really need it but it just hurts spending 40 caps just for fast travelling. The only active int perk you need is makeshift warrior (and nerd rage if bloody). Don't spend more than 5-7 points in int. Lock picking as an active perk is useless. Definitely get bloody mess and adrenaline (but only 1 perk point. There's a lot more you could do but it really depends on if you're going for bloody
---
The terminals don’t have an entry after you disable for me. May be a glitch.
---
I can only read German and Spanish so I have no idea what this post says.
---
Is there a reason you visit this sub?  Or is this it
---
Jeez you need to take a class on yoga or something you are so excited about literally nothing
---
Even waiting for it to go on sale isn't a safe bet.  
---
Bought something 50% off from the Fallout 4 creation club, was free the next week.
---
Still moderately salty
---
How is that ridiculous?  You don't **need** to go hard 100% of the time and you know it.  If you're planning to share experience, act like it.
---
And the 80+ times I've run the event to get my 8 says otherwise ;-)
---
Obviously there's no way to know for sure what the actual drop rate is, but for me it was ~10%, but even with a sample size of 80, it certainly could have been just plain bad luck.
---
We'll see what the next 80 runs gets me :P
---
Not excited just laughing at the comments
---
There’s really people out here doing God’s work
---
Yep, and you must like having your base destroyed since you can't seem to figure out how turrets work :3
---
Not that it'll save you anyway. We already know how to get around those. Enjoy adventure mode without a CAMP
---
Lo siento mucho.
---
Es tut mir wirklich leid.
---
Damn right we do.  It's set in WV!
---
Idk you seem to put three !!! Every time you comment I don’t really see the comedic value in the comments but sure whatever makes you laugh dude
---
I did that for a while. Built a new camp each week. It's fun. Good tip is do it the hard way and don't float anything. I learned so much stuff trying to build to the terrain. That and your buildings will always look unique.
---
Even though a recent datamine covered by Juicehead showed several other locations. Plus from those who have glitched in, they have seen there is a semi-blocked off tunnel system used by the Purveyor to move around Appalachia.
---
Swimming is pretty easy too. The hardest thing is finding someone to let you revive them in water.
---
No I love seeing the camps.  I just hate spawning into walls multiple times and when I finally get to the machines to see 2\* or 3\* but can't see what the bonus are so I don't know if I should spend the thousands of caps or not.  So the frustration is really on Bethesdas lack of testing this and not on creativity of the player camps.
---
wait there is a whale skeleton in the toxic valley ?
---
Be ready for the no-life's that hang out on subs for games they don't play so that they can bash the developer and the people that do play...oh shit I didn't get to warn them.
---
Since Betheada has said that mods aren't supported etc etc i would not consider any mod 100% safe to use. They will support mods in the future (atleast they said so..) but not yet, so technically speaking using a mod now could break the code of conduct and get you banned.
---
&gt; Now my question is, if my camp was at budget limit, and my stash was already full, what would have happened? Would these items have disappeared?
---
Probably not, because putting stuff up for sale doesn't remove them from your stash. They're still in there and count towards your stash total, they just get flagged for sale.
---
My mule has 1200 pounds between the stash box and my mule it's all junk legendary weapons and armor all farmed none is duped I would have more but I got lazy and I did not have a mule alt before I learned about legendary scrapper. Why would Bethesda give us alt's if we were not meant to use them? ( for hoarding)
---
To each is there own right??
---
Okay, so I'm still not seeing the issue.  Are higher level players whining about not getting exp for kills that they weren't there for?  What's your angle?
---
Don't feel bad, most people find this game unplayable.
---
Wait what xD? You just need to collect bones and dont grins for a fucking recipe?
---
I suppose
---
I place an * in front of all the gear I use regularly, that way it's at the top, nickname or not, that way I can easily requip them quickly if I need to!
---
They should turn the red reflector lenses into lights
---
Yes, after 50 you get no more park points.
---
&gt;onfirmed, picking the bones count as Pemmican cooked O\_o Super weird that it's wrongly translated in several 
---
Thank you, that should be it. Gonna test this as soon as i can find a fedora... Perhaps we should apply as translators at Bethesda... :)
---
Absolutely. I wanted to build onto one of the monorail cars in the bog but it already had a staircase going up. Two would’ve been redundant. :/
---
I did that. The sweet 10 atoms was well worth it
---
In the game for me. I have seen some people charge some RIDICULOUS prices at their vendors though, so I understand what you're saying. They just go with in game value, which if the economy was functional would be okay, but sadly it's not and our caps have a .... cap.
---
So the only reason to be “afraid” of super high level people is just the gear they have right?
---
Good luck. Itll never happen. You need to grow up kid.
---
I have 6 points in agility. 3 for action boy and 3 for sprinting. Lower cost for sprinting helps when you need to close the distance to an enemy to melee
---
That's been my suggestion for a while now.
---
Exactly.
---
Yes that and they probably have perfected their perks to be great at pvp
---
Awesome build for a heavy gunner, im pretty well rounded but have to ask, why don’t you use different cards for perception? I usually just swap mine out when needed
---
I'm still hoping that the theory about "Wastelanders" in Fall of 2019 is true.
---
The level 300 may have a cap loss disadvantage if they die but its capped at 50 caps now. That would be it given your scenario
---
Yeah MODUS is actually William Shatner.
---
Your main quest is to survive and build the world again...
---
For what it's worth on PC I was able to go clear out my Photos directory and then got credit for the Brahmin which I wasn't able to get previously.
---
Ooo that's a good idea I have a bunch of melons for their sweet covering both hunger and thirst but havent grown anything else.
---
Doubtful, I'd assume the display cases option is probably easiest for them to do, otherwise they'll have to tweak or remove camp items "intersects with another object" collision, which is already touchy
---
Crouch and aim at the ground before inspecting.
---
Oh there's a main storyline, it's just not spoon fed to you. And yeah, it's a highly enjoyable game.
---
Finally I have my answer. Lmao. My bud and I have always been avoiding high level people in survival because we think they have so much more health than us and whatnot.
---
There's a lot of difference between "hey, I've been gone a while, what's new in the game, some one spoon feed me information I can get from reading the official announcements in twenty minutes" which is, you know, "easily sourced information" and "hey, I just hit level 50, what perk cards are individuals running".  Which is asking for individual information from individual people. 
---
I mean, if we got 500 of these a week it'ed get old too, but at least it's not "hey someone copy paste the highlights for me again".
---
I can appreciate the effort here, and it came out pretty good. Are you a professional or just a side thing?
---
I use extra corn and carrots for that - soup hits both needs.
---
it happens if you spend the majority of your time farming. and only after hundreds of hours.
---
that's nor particularly enjoyable, at least for me. especially because I run solo.
---
Completely agree my friend! Sure it’s got some problems but a satisfying fallout experience. I recommend a melee power armor build FYI. It will save you ammo and if you can get a bloodied sledge/super sledge you’ll have a weapon that can take on any enemy in the game
---
Sweet!
---
I don’t get the negativity either. It’s not perfect but I enjoy it.
---
Very randomly and rarely. But it's always alcohol that does it for me.
---
I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore...
---
My cabin house has no doors so you're good stopping by!
---
At level 200 with decent gear i was killed by two shots from level 8 guy pump shotgun.
---
Thanks for the tip, sounds like a really cool way to spend time in the wasteland. I need to find a peaceful location first, my current camp is always attacked by crabs and super mutants, the non-stop repair made me not want to spend time on it.
---
Your a legend mate, this will hey so much
---
The initial backlash was because of all the bugs present at launch, some even from Fallout 4. Couple that with the stuff that has no connection to the actual gameplay (nylon bags, Nuka Dark etc) and you've got a massive shitstorm.
---
Also, it was extremely profitable as a youtuber to bash the game for views.
---
Many bugs have since been patched and the updates made the game a lot more enjoyable.
---
And all I get are Liberators &amp; mongrels...I'd take your cats any day!
---
Was only implemented in FO4, so I wouldn't go that far. But it would still be lovely to not have to deal with the .ini

Is it interesting that it showed up? I feel like that's really normal for Reddit. Happens to me all the time.
---
As for the civic center, I also mentioned other possibilities, but again you like to take things out of context to make yourself seem like the victim. There could have recently been a horde event that happened to have spawned in the civic center, and the legendary was a victim, because that has happened to me, or someone else could have just cleared it before you did and the legendary hadn't had time to respawn yet. You are the one who automatically jumped on the defensive about being accused of lying, and I just threw a hypothetical "this is why someone would lie about this" out there.
---
That sounds like it would seriously F them up. I need to do more grinding and HOPEFULLY can find something more then a 1* armor or knife
---
Doesn't matter if they're a duper or not, mule accounts way over the weight limit are the reason there is a hard cap on weight.  So yeah, someone in the position of needing to destroy stuff is totally "part of the problem".
---
Tadpole Questline&gt; Badges - World 
---
I am trying to earn the World Experience Badges. Here is my issue:
---
One requires me to find certain sites in each area. One of these sites is Grafton Dam. I "found" Grafton Dam months ago, it's lit up on my map, I can fast-travel to it. I did fast travel to it today, but it still shows up in my challenges as being un-found.  
---
The same thin for "Top of the World"  I did that entire questline ages ago, but in Challenges it doesn't show up as being "found."  I tried going there, it did not fix the issue.   
---
Am I misunderstanding what "found" means in terms of earning these badges, or is this a fatal glitch that will prevent me from ever completing these quests.  
---
Also, I hopped servers for 10-15 minutes at the Mothman monument area, visited both egg areas and never, ever got a dead tourist. I have yet to find a single dead tourist at any of the sites they are known to spawn. Very frustrating.
---
At the end of that, I just imagined you putting on sunglasses followed by a loud scream and a Who song playing.
---
They don't seem to have released a patch today (the cycle to do that with consoles is a bit long, so it takes some time).  It's unlikely that those will get fixed without a patch to fix them.
---
There actually is a main quest, and it's awesome. One of my favorite main story lines in a Fallout. There's obviously room for debate about how it's told, but it's a great story. You're experiencing bits of it now, but it picks up later on in the game.
---
It's a really cool game. Enjoy!
---
That's why you form your own opinion and not listen to everyone else. Ofcourse the game had and still has it's problems, but most of the negativity out there was a bit exaggerated and done for attention/views.
---
I lock my purifiers because I need the caps, other than that my door is always open
---
Yeah, to be honest I've never been good at debating, I'll admit the statement I made was racist, even if it wasn't my intention. I'll reciprocate the upvote.
---
Yes that’s 100% how it works
---
So only the Prime Reciever can take the ultrucite ammo?
---
no, nothing is obvious, this game is about as intuitive as a dead flannel
---
You could also just chuck it at a passerby them reprimand it as you smash someone's face in with it. That is one way to get around bounties.
---
"Was not me sir, was the rock"
---
I need larger font as well. And the notes to be more legible. My eyesight sucks. Especially the font on the dailies.
---
It was also in Fallout 3 and New Vegas.
---
Pick a different spot with different terrain and views. It helps keep everything fresh and you will surprise yourself a lot with the cool things you can come up with. If it wasn't for player vending I would still be doing it.
---
Very colorful story. Did the samr thing with paramedics suit.  Bought it for 3k. Thought it was rare..went back to my camp to stash it..swear to god there was a team of 3 lower levels there all had em on. I was PISSED
---
Mount and ride a Scorchbeast and use a Ski Sword to behead a Glowing Feral Ghoul in a Nukezone while naked.
---
I swap between Lock Pick perks and Glow Sight. But most of the time just have lock picking since i like opening everything i find. Not like there are much choice in perception for melee toon :)
---
It varies with your build, I use the Shielded Road leathers (Raider, +3 PER, +3 AGI) for my Stealth Sniper, but I also keep an Enclave Suit in my inventory (only weighs 0.1 lbs.) for the extra 15 lbs of carry weight when needed.
---
Yeah. And auto weapons don't have recoil in VATS (only way to use it, the recoil literally makes you aim at the sky after 2-3 shots)
---
15 lbs is 6.81 kg
---
Finally something with a little bit of Mojo yeah!
---
Yeah, I was confusing it with the Backpacker challenge. My archeology challenge has craft 5 fox jerky, no mention of pemmican whatsoever.
---
I was in the same boat, was put off by the negative reviews but found it in sale so cheap I couldn't say no and now I'm 100 hours in and completely hooked 👍
---
It's never happened to me, so that's (legitimately) interesting. Literally _every single_ other person who's done what you did, (show up in a month old post calling me a liar, or similar) was a stalker. So  yeah, there's "defensive" behaviors baked in to that. 
---
Your post wasn't "hypothetical". It was a directed statement that I would (for some unknown reason) lie about this. 
---
And, at this point for shits and grins, two more attempts. One full clear with a full group of enemies inside, no legendary. One where the server was cleared out. I think I'll do ten in a row. If I get a _single_ legendary I'll let you know.
---
just uploaded a video, cheers
---
Get the Vault Tec Bomber Jacket from the store. All black, and amazing.
---
thank you!
---
thank you for the compliment
---
You are right! I forgot about the presets. I think I only remembered FO4 because the sliders customized the color instead of just changing it. Bring back blue ui!
---
I've for sure seen that with my old camps. My latest one, I took my sweet time to keep my scrapping to a minimum.
---
The mole miner gear is on the nuka store already 👍
---
Fucking impossible!
---
Everything’s in the details.. those cables, the back is gorgeous... BUT THERE ARE SOME « TEXTURE PROBLEMS » the left knee is messed up, and something weird is clipping between the legs. I’ll write a post about it with some pictures to clarify this. And I seriously hope Bethesda will fix the skin because it’s worth 1400 atoms.
---
There are two very good reasons to have 3 perception so you can, if you so desire, swap out all your perception perks for picklock. 
---
1. Level 3 safes have a chance at rare plans, which is awesome
---
2. One particularly annoying section of the nuke silo can by bypassed entirely if you have level 3 lockpick
---
they're all paintjobs, yes. and they look the same regardless of the armor, so an excavator would be made to look like x01 if using the plague skin.
---
If you play on ps4 you can go into system settings under accessibility and turn on a zoom function.
---
Super helpful tip for anyone struggling to read the small fonts.
---
No, dupers are the reason there is a hard cap. Not people who play the game legit and use mules.
---
Ever see those trees in the bog that are all wires and piped up?  Ambient noise fake birds man
---
Many of the bugs from Fallout 4 are still in game.  76 was essentially a ported version of 4 with multiplayer.  Obviously some things were fixed, and new stuff (including bugs) were added, but with the small dev team assigned to 76, it's not terribly surprising that a number of things were missed.
---
So essentially, if you loved Fallout 4, with all it's warts, and weren't tied to human storytellers, there's little reason why you wouldn't love 76.  Much like you, I picked it up later so the shitstorm and patching would be over (as much as it will ever be), and I'm well over 400 hours in.  And I can't wait to get home to put in a few more.
---
Milk of human kindness not so fresh?
---
thank you...the spot was very forgiving when it came to placing down those foundations, once that was sorted everything else fell right into place.
---
More turrets! 
---
I get a deathclaws that spawns each time. Its fantastic. One time had 3 legendary deathclaws pummeling my defense walls.
---
Thank you for this. Was looking for this information before but realized no one bothered to really ask.
---
Got a meeting for about 30 minutes then I can log on
---
FYI, the skull mask removes the players beard for some reason. What a waste...
---
He was just asking a favor people like you is why 76 is dead
---
It certainly isn't part of any "free DLC forever".
---
I feel you for sure! I get annoyed swapping them out myself lol. All my strength cards (15) go to my melee and heavy guns. ’swap out for strong back when needed’  and I run 8 rifleman cards as well. Level 3 covert ops in agility.. soo I’m always ready for anything!
---
Theres more new stuff too
---
way over? they were talking about people with 100,000 of pounds, this guy is only like 375 pounds over the limit
---
you do realize that the "absolute  weight limit " threshold is character weight limit + 1500 pounds right?
---
Op is not that far off
---
Sounds awesome👍🏻 I’ll make sure visitors won’t be met with Free Fallin lol
---
So it's not just the same one from Freddy's? Because that one doesn't work with hats.
---
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I've seen others built up on the monorail towers, one required you to walk the rail between towers to get to it, but never asked how they did it.
---
Gotten 3 bomber jackets from turning in Tech plans.  I'll sell you another for 10 caps.  Not really, I had them for 100 in my vendor and they are gone.  It was a great story though and I can definitely relate.
---
haha i put up a few missile turrets, haven't run into a sheepsquatch right here yet. the events free range and the messenger show up occasionally up and down the road. I usually just get radtoads, anglers, for crawlers and ticks visiting me every now and then. other days its mutants and scorched. lol
---
i like it
---
I do get what you are saying. But War and Death  just felt to busy  Plague was really good though and it was not overmuch more complex than Famine.
---
This is a much needed addition to the game.
---
Um I don't know what you're doing here pal, but you're supposed to get your opinion from YouTube channels.  What are you doing playing it and deciding for yourself?  
---
How does it feel to be on report, lordraz0r?  Cause that's where you are.
---
thank you.. the mire has been bustling lately. would be cool to have a community all along the water
---
New stuff usually lasts a while, at worst (usually their flash sales) you have 24 hours.  I'd expect the free stuff will be there until tomorrow night at the very least.
---
To play the game! Jesus.
---
Curious myself on the discovery of already discovered locations, since I had the same issue/question
---
The government is controlling our minds man, the birds are just cameras and the noise is the static feed scrambled into a code so we can't understand it.
---
Welcome!
---
Just fwi, read everything... listen to everything...
---
There IS a story. It's just not told the same way as the previous titles. The whole thing is a series of flashbacks.
---
I go support with a DR syringer +exploding cryolator
---
Do you have to find the tourist to actually get the camera?  I have these spawning in red toolboxes all the time but I have completed that quest line. I don’t know if you have to complete one before the other
---
I haven’t found him yet and I think I’ll like it to stay that way because he would DESTROY my poor little character within 3 seconds
---
Yeah I did the same, makes it easy to get it out the stash.
---
I renamed my weapons/armour when I played Fallout 4, so as soon as I got the ability I renamed everything. Nice to have all your equipped items appear above everything else.
---
the two skeletons under there are awesome! they always have chems and a bottle of something whenever i pop up. lol i couldn't build over them either, so decided to just have chillin with an easter egg.
---
I am up for it, my IGN is brpst98889
---
The FW monster finds you. 
---
And will follow you.
---
And will corner you if able.
---
Didnt shoot at me while I was in the garage, but as soon as I tried to come out....
---
And it was full daylight when that happened to me.
---
Ecin
---
That's a good tip, acts as a barrier. Plus with all the XXX's it's pretty glaring so you'll notice it right away.
---
I use brackets around everyone of the items that I actually use and don’t want to stash or sell, because they all go down to the bottom of the inventory
---
I'm going to get downvoted and insulted for this but, ignoring the bugs which yes there are however they are very easy to ignore, many people who are major fans of the cities and are not used to playing survival multiplayer games. This is not a traditional single player bethesda game due to the multiplayer aspect and items indicative of that nature and they struggled and some are still struggling to deal with that.
---
Thanks. I'll send you a message when I get on later tonight. Need help with any of your challenges?
---
Username: asully102
---
I've heard if you make an alt, and go to those locations, it might unlock for you.  I haven't tried it (I really don't care that much about those things), but I tucked that tidbit back behind my other working brain cell just in case.
---
I need to log off in 15 minutes unfortunately.. maybe the next time?
---
I guess I didn’t explain it how I meant to, I was just hoping experienced players would share their builds to inspire players like me who aren’t sure what type of character they want to work towards
---
😂 Well at least I know I can get away with selling it for 100 caps!
---
Bethesda really needs to look into addressing their accessibility... The subtitles are inconsistent, not always available (like listening to a holotape while at a terminal), and the subtitle text itself is small/difficult to read and *not adjustable*. I regularly play with someone who is hard of hearing and I have to help him all the time.
---
 It should be embarrassing for a large company to have such a deficiency.
---
You should try teaming up sometimes, I still play solo now &amp; then, but spend more time on teams, we do lots of events, and launch lots of Nukes, sometimes we just work on quests together, but never pass up a chance to score some legendary kills. I used to Farm WS a lot, but it gets boring after a while, still if I notice it's empty, I will pop over and kill all the ghouls real quick, I've gotten a lot of great gear from there.
---
You know what else I noticed, it’s the same bird sounds used in DayZ. I haven’t played DayZ for a good year now but remember them clear as day. Makes me wanna play it again.
---
Doesn't change the fact that they do have way more history than the game makes it seem.
---
I read dead funnel and thought of a dead funnel cake so that was a good laugh but yeah I know it could have said “seek new assignments in world under challenges”

60+ Super Mutants
---
righttttttttt
---
Side thing really, my more serious songs are a different story completely
---
Isn't the damage scaled tho, so if your low level you do more damage PvP in survival.
---
you can go to C:\Users\...\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 and back them up, I do so occasionally just in case
---
This is my build

I use a bloodied death claw with full unyielding set of armor. My damage is around 1800 for the claw and my damage resist are around 500 for physical and energy. I have lead lining in all my armor so normal rads are not a big deal, but I need to use power armor in nuke zones
---
Im pretty sure it is bugged.  Does not seem to much care about it.  hah
---
When is this coming?
---
you never seen a super mutant about level 60?
---
They confirmed it in the patch notes.
---
*Loot: The legendary drop rates for the Gatling Gun and Cryolator have been adjusted to better match all other weapons.
---
Why in the world would a random number generator have different drop rates for different guns? There are roughly 45 ranged weapons......your chance of getting a Handmade should be 1 in 44.
---
None for me, I came across the course purely by chance walking the opposite direction, so by the time I got to the start line, I had it all memorized
---
that's kinda my point though, I hate playing in groups. I don't mind pvping but coop just isn't for me. I'd rather just not play the game at all. same with farming and rng rates.
---
after a few hundred hours farming WS you realize that yeah, this is not enjoyable at all. still it's the only way to get a remotely good weapon, to devote most your playtime farming. either for gear or mats to maximize your farming.
---
Thank you so much!
---
People keep asking for decorations and an increased camp budget, and I want that stuff too. But camp performance has been kind of... super bad (on my system at least) recently. 
---
So to answer your question, no... I don't think the game is quite ready for decorations yet. I hope they can get things running a bit smoother soon, cause decorations could be really cool.
---
This is great info, thank you for sharing
---
LOL I know.  I still have to kill 5 rabbits to get my Gardening badge.
---
Darker nights, stronger rainstorm and stronger foggy weather!
---
What I did is I  made 6 terminals on my camp and 6 terminals in a friends camp locked them up got off the team &amp; we did each others and took each others bounty times2  but it’s a lot of materials though not gonna lie
---
god damn it’s the Institute spying on us AGAIN
---
I’ve played a lot of survival, and it’s 90 percent exploits, and 10 percent build/gear.
---
Spawn protection. Lame, makes Combat essentially turn based, 1 kills 2, 2 kills 1. Being a higher level is punished by losing more caps here. Everyone abuses it to line themselves up with an enemy, weapons kill quickly anyhow so it’s a manner of slamming the trigger or VATS. They can really fix this by implementing a damage reduction in PvP generally.
---
Stealthboys. Lame, easy out for invisibility in Combat. Several minutes of cheese. Shouldn’t they deactivate when you shoot so they’re actual stealth devices and not just blocks of cheddar cheating cheese? I hate having to lug these around.
---
Level abuse (something I’ve tried myself). Level 5 explosive laser rifle with a mutation heavy level 7 character rips anything apart, and loses literally nothing. Lower levels absolutely trample others because of the poorly designed balancing system that places emphasis on 1 piece/set of gear instead of builds and classes of weapons.
---
Teams split profit (when the profit is already split tremendously). Lame, creates no incentive to join teams, creates leeches (if the caps were worth your
---
Here’s some ideas I’ve had about it:
---
Make cap gain on kill for each person. The killer receives caps. 150.  Killed loses 150-100 on death. It divides amongst the team when people die, so everyone loses caps. Yes it sounds terrible but there’s no reason at all to keep teammates alive, this would fix it. If the person is alone, he loses 50 and that’s it. This cap gain and loss would be universal, lower levels would lose 150-100 too.
---
Stealthboys deactivate when a gun is used or if the player runs/jumps. (This way, no snipes but also stealth melee can come back into play)
---
Spawn protection would be eradicated. What would happen instead is the player is given the map, and chooses a location to spawn in, with 76, camps, and train stations being free on entry (but not after)
---
Workshops would also be a choice for spawn (for caps), keeping workshops on the map and not hard to get to.
---
Also, Damage cap would be balanced per weapon. So like Hunting Rifle 2 shots, handmade 5 shots, cryolator 7, and whatnot.
---
Wooosh
---
Looks like we rob a vault and have robot buddies from the road map.
---
Uh, because they look nice when used with foundations?
---
A lot of people use mods.  More than you might think.  You're also the first person I've ever heard mention mods in relation to the bans before, I suspect that's just idle paranoia you were hearing.
---
IMO, a mod like that wouldn't be any different than marking up your monitor to show your sight location.  It's probably in a somewhat grey area, but I really doubt that something like that would be on the radar for Bethesda right now.
---
Bethesda's only comment published about mods (that I've seen) says they don't "support" the use, and that they can break the game.  No mention about disallowing them (or any punishment).
---
Use your head with mods...if you find an aimbot, or a mod that lets you see hidden players in PvP, avoid them.  For non-advantageous mods (most re-texturing mods, for example), I wouldn't be worried about it.
---
Or, just get a little sticker and put it on your monitor.  Let's see them ban you for that! ;-)
---
standard is green. i wish it was white and black like i had it set in fallout 4

It's not up to the quality I'd prefer but oh well. Feels positions a bit high and clippy. Works with my Hat (Antlers)

I like to pretend it's gargantuan flock of mutated chickens.
---
I’d also like to see a log file that we can view that contains all of the messages (quest rewards, team invites, and now vendor purchases) that we receive on screen. Too often they come and go and I’ve missed them. I’d like to look at a log and see what messages I’ve missed.
---
&gt; I'd much rather pay $20 every three months and get new stuff once in a while 
---
99% of general players would **not**, however. That's why models like this do better than models asking you to buy the latest DLC pack.
---
1. The game is doing better than ever. Servers are full on Tuesday night.(EU time)
---
2. Skipping content doesn't do the community any good. People can help you solve some tough challenges but you should bother at least trying them.
---
3. They skip content and then go and yell "gaem sucks, there's nothing to do, gaem is ded."
---
Big problem with CAMP mobility is the game charges 40 caps in increasing increments just to move the freaking thing.  So most people, like myself, just find a spot and stick with it.  The game already charges caps for just about anything you do.
---
keep doing the event you'll get the plans then make a lv50 or whatever
---
Mine is radstags and mole rats.  My turrets fucking go insane each time someone comes in or my base is dwindled down by constant spawning mobs.
---
Oof. 😫 I wouldn’t have been happy either, that’s a lot to spend.
---
Go to southern bell motel by Harper's ferry, you may or may not trigger the event. Same if you go to that BBQ place ( i fogot what its called ) it can also spawn as a random spawn. I always get these along with the mothman and the flatwoods monster every where at the wrong time and wrong place, always when im farming for materials and over encumbered. I once got 2 sheepsquatch's 4 glowing gulpers, 6 glowing mirelurk kings and 4 scorched beast all at once as i stepped out of a nuke zone farming for flux. While all the randoms trailing behind me just f'd the f off somewhere leaving me alone to deal with all f'ers...
---
Honestly, the robots make better NPCs than the humans in previous titles, with a few exceptions.  (I loved Moira Brown, No-Bark Noonan and KLE-O, except she was a robot that identified as a woman.)
---
I really enjoy listening to Pompy and Penny.  Great voice acting.  Insult Bot and Mr. Squeeze are also a welcome sight.
---
Not my post. Just courteous to upvote someone for posting helpful info.
---
IIRC there's a patch next Tuesday that'll add the Arktos Lab as well as bug fixes.
---
What?!?  I've scrapped over 50 of these before getting the BOS VII paint job.
---
I just picked up the starlet sniper outfit, but maybe I’ll get that next time! 😊
---
 Adrenaline is pretty good. I run 2 points now and my 3* Nocturnal Combat Knife gets into the 300+ range after a few ghouls. Its seriously OP anyway, as 'one shots' 4 times a sec, make any ghoul horde a joke. ;)

You need the tourist to get the Bucket List to start.

lets be honest even dead these npc's are more alive then 95% of fallout 4's 
---
now if you excuse me I have to hammer on this fan for the rest of the damn game......
---
thats a keeper.
---
I have seen the flat wood monster twice now normally i sneak up on it and it disappears but the mothman I RAN INTO HIM MORE TIME THAN I CAN COUNT randomly minding my own business BOOM either yellow or red eyes I got a freakin vengeful mothman on my ass once he found me 3 time in one server and I didn’t kill him I’m tiny
---
Same, normal mobs for my area is just radstags but sometimes MOTHER FUCKING SCREECH BAT comes out of no where making my customers leave
---
thats a good point people just juice dps but honestly im thinking quality of life and making things easier should be aded.
---
that is not the theory its the fact that one of the 2 people are in a vault suit and the other isn't and since every photo of every drawing has a vault suit except that one means its not a vault dweller 
---
that said I kind of suspect its either A a "npc" or B we will have a different game start where the players become the responders or raiders or bos or ect ect
---
This has happened to me a few times over about 30+  solo launches.   No turrets, too many of all types of robots, almost no robots, turrets shooting ballistic ammo ( that one was tough), locks glitched where they require a lvl. 4 lockpick skill (no such thing).  It can be very glitchy in the silo's sometimes.  Like everything else I guess.
---
go to the sheepsquach imposter event.  there's a lake there where people die  ALL THE TIME
---
Sell the extra then. I've bought some for 1cp a piece.
---
I won't be on until later but I would be willing to do it.
---
whats a nice bloodied build?
---
Not going to lie - unhappy is my default emotion when wearing a poncho.  To be fair, I only wear rain ponchos - in the rain - and if it's raining enough that I'm wearing a poncho it probably means that my feet are wet.  Terrible.
---
Personally, I'd rather pay diddly squat for the new story/gameplay content and only grab a smattering of the Atom Shop items with the Atoms I get just playing. I've missed out on some cool items I wouldn't have minded having, but I won't lose any sleep over it.
---
You should only build somewhere your defenses are capable of defending. Everytime the enemy spawns it's going to be in the same place, there may be a cycle of a few different enemies. Build a couple Machine gun turrets and you'll see how successful it is when the enemies spawn. It's inconvenient but surely easily fixed on your side. FFS I'll come build them for you.
---
My gawd...
---
This is why foundation castles are important to be able to make! Protect your facilities from the wasteland critters!
---
This post was about how the responders seemed to have more personality, nothing about history, than the minutemen.
---
But not Sloths :c
---
Yeah that's poor design, I think the cost should be static but based on two things, the total amount of budget consumed (larger bases cost more to move) and based it on level (max cost is at level 50, players greater than level 50 pay the same fee based on used budget). 
---
A level 10 player should only have to pay a small fee since presumably they won't have many caps yet. And the game at a low level encourages you to move your C.A.M.P. (as instructed by the Overseer).
---
You’re not wrong the prices on this game are stupid. I can somewhat see a decent price tag of 10 bucks on like the War Rider skin but don’t worry you’ll see it again in a different color. I bought the bone raider set with atoms I earned. Now there’s a blood raider? Why not release the blood one in game? Would’ve made for good content and give people a way to have the armor even though it’s now the original. I refuse to spend money on micro transactions after being addicted to the gamble of loot boxes. It’s all just dumb, like you said I’d really enjoy paying 20 bucks every few months or shit even 15 a month like WoW if they’ll just release content for me to earn and unlock. As a ftp atom wise fallout 76 player it’s near impossible to keep up with the atom shop releases. Not only that but as a player I feel like nothing more than a dollar sign when all of the camp items are being kept as paid instead of rewarding us for reaching the end of quest lines or for killing a hard boss. Nope, just spend your hard money so you can look cool.
---
I don’t mind micro transaction stores because I understand it’s a business, but I do dislike it when it’s money over content. We are being paygated for the best looking items. With minuscule content updates. After reaching endgame there’s nothing to do but do it all again. The content release schedules need to be faster and a lot more items being put into base game. It won’t happen though since game killer Zenimax is involved.
---
I enjoy this game and play it everyday with friends. But it’s turning into a mobile quality game pretty quick. Next thing you know you’ll be paying for “content updates” in the atom shop. Oh wait we already are..
---
The real question is, is it still bugged so you can complete the challenge in adventure mode?
---
Well, it's a bug one way or the other: either the challenge verbiage is off, or the game doesn't properly detect the hasmat suit as clothing. "Naked" is a pretty clear descriptor, and really isn't open to much in the way of interpretation.
---
it works like last weeks again ;)
---
the best place is in a swimming pool like the one at flatwoods hotel or WS
---
damn the people here must hate this thread, its getting downvoted so much...
---
Plus it makes my female characters butt look good (which I've learned from my wife is the most important feature of any outfit.
---
I think the point is that it forces you to have a chem that has to be found in the world. So having Buffout and Med-X as uncraftbale makes it so you can’t just go an a flora gathering run and make a tun of super-chems.
---
That’s also probably why you can’t make Psychotats. You can make Psycho and Mentats. Rather than take one of those away, they take away the super-chem.
---
Well that depends on whether you're using power armor. Non power armor builds are generally better but you need some really expensive armor
---
If it’s an official post, I hope that my message will have consequences. So, I have the Pale Rider Skin, and for 1400 atoms I’ve noticed unacceptable « texture imperfections » in my opinion. The left knee is messed up, I don’t think that I should be more specific because it’s obvious to the eye, especially when you’re not inside the PA. And the other one, is something clipping through the front of the torso, below the belt. It’s shaped like a triangle and it’s just weird looking. Please. Oh please, I’ve been waiting for this skin for so long. I really love it, and fixing those imperfections would make it marvelous. Fixing this is a need in my opinion, not so much for the “players” but also for Bethesda. This is a symbolic work, it’s a representation of the Pale Rider, one of the Four Horsemen. A lot of work as been put into this skin, I love the simplicity of it, and the really unique features such as the well thought/placed cables. Please take care of this skin, and give us the best final product, fix it please. 
---
Please, upvote this so that people like me can hope to see their Pale Rider Power Armor look exactly how it should, considering it’s an ephemeral and expensive skin.
---
TL;DR: Bethesda should fix the texture imperfections of the Pale Rider Skin: messed up left knee, clipping triangle in the front of the torso, below the belt.
---
but you can't stack foundations anymore.
---
River in flatwoods is awesome for this fyi
---
I was thinking Spruce Knob where the swim race challenge is. Wake up the Mirelark Queen and have her knock us out, and then once we Revive, down with the queen!
---
&gt;You're also the first person I've ever heard mention mods in relation to the bans before

Guess you weren't active at the time bans happened. There was a lot of talk about it, and youtubers making videos about suspicions of mods being one reason. But again who knows. And i know perfectly well that there are lots of people using mods. Those are the same people that come crying/posting after being banned "I did nuthin wrongz".

Wizard of Oz: hardcore addition

It actually looks really good with the brick building set.  Then again I'm a sucker for 60's-70's colors.  Burnt oranges and browns, pea greens, mustard yellows, brick reds....I love all of them.
---
I had a couple on my vendor for 200 caps. A guy bought them all and then sent me a message about how he was going to resell them for more and that I didn't realize what I had. I sent him a message back asking if he would like to buy 7 more.
---
Do we have any indication that this is the first stage in the story and the world will advance and change? Like it does in previous games
---
So would it be a nightmare to be in power armor in the middle of class?
---
do you know if he will spawn for you after you have completed the challenge?
---
Can I help a friend find the tourist?
---
The Minutemen definitely had a personality, they were just A-Holes. 
---
Both of them.
---
 Lazy Preston who wanted you to do everything, and that old bitchy general at the Castle. 
---
As much as people missed NPCs in 76, the holotape stories we got about the responders were superior to the minutemen characters we got in FO4.
---
Oh was it, it was so easy I just did it in survival
---
Open up mailbox it blows up.. good times in the wasteland!
---
My guess would be (taken from an archaeology website)
---
"The bones and teeth of animals are frequently collected in substantial quantities on archaeology excavation sites."
---
Which would also explain the fox part... Animals.
---
The t rex skull would be wrong though.
---
Do you think I could borrow the plan for a few seconds please? Would be greatly appreciated.
---
Done the exam question, doing the terminals is easier with the information now provided, but I don't see me launching a nuke any time this year, I can't ever get very far into the silo on my own, I don't join up with others easily, I play solo mostly because that's just how I am, so I think I'm just not going bother with some of these badges, I have my backpack now, the upgrades can wait for now.
---
Extra points if we can have a custom name for him
---
Bu...but my army of sheepsquach plushies I would have to replace some of them D:

This is hard to believe unless you had no health. A pump shotgun at level 5 must have around 50 damage
---
SCREW legendaries, get a drill.
---
YEAH, BABY! YEAH!
---
I'm probably not off by saying I've turned in over 200 tech data and I've yet to get the paint job.  I gave up and only turn them in if I'm in the area now.
---
Did you notice the texture imperfections of the Pale Rider? The left knee is messed up, and there’s a weird triangle shaped thing that clips through the front of the torso below the belt. Let me know if you see that, and help me get it fixed for the next update!
---
I just want it to be one set of cards while at my CAMP, Vendor, and then everything, Manually swapping them is killing me. 
---
Even it was easier to swap them.
---
Classy! I like it!
---
Hello, you are exactly me. I even bought the game yesterday.
---
With the update there I think there is a way to expose magazine and some other displaying item (like I think buble head?), but I don't have the recipe for now and I want to know if there is a way to expose scrap like teddy bears or else?
---
I mean, I think a lot of messages would be pretty um... colorful?
---
Don’t forget your Indiana Jones hat while you do your archaeology or whatever!
---
This confuses me, fallout 4 got rid of the gender-specific clothing and you can the exact same dresses, suits, etc as a male or female. The only example I can think of that differs is the grognak costume and that special 3ch outfit. Why is it still an issue with hair?
---
What's the weapon this week?
---
Wasn’t there a stage someone data mined? Any further details on that?
---
Don't forget, cat whiskers can be used to make high pitched twang noises, just add them to your banjo for additional meownd.
---
I sever hopped and checked a few different sites for quite awhile before I found the tourist
---
where have you been 2 days ago xD
---
That was me,Your Wecome.
---
This is the only game I know of where you have to play this way in online gaming. Every other MMO style game with group mechanics that I am familiar with shares XP and loot rights with the party. It is almost unthinkable to dumb down your own abilities to have to allow for this.
---
You're also asking people to carry extra weapons, that are quite literally ineffective, in a game where weight is extraordinarily important because people are so restrained. It is ridiculous.
---
Well, I did, but I started at 250 and marked them down and they sold over the weekend.  All to the same player.  You prolly bought one of them for 750
---
Glass-house bloodied isn't for everyone. Some people don't want to make 40 stimpacks a day. And I bet you could be wrong. A VATS Crit build rifle with Zealot's and Prime probably does more damage per minute.
---
Of course I have I was making a funny because it sounded like 60 Super Mutants not level 60+ Super Mutants.  Must have moved your CAMP by some water cause you saltyyyy.
---
There is a f*****g pet rock? No way this is awesome!!
---
There's also a Level 1 in Harper's Ferry in one of the buildings.
---
General's Steakhouse has a Level 0 if you feel like fast traveling.
---
The prison has a Level 3 and actually some decent loot if you hack it.
---
I tried to maximize my hacking around reward. Harper's and the Steakhouse has stuff to kill.
---
Probably an NPC out of those two options. I don't see it being a new game mode since they are doing Nuclear Winter.
---
I'm glad :)
---
Who said they weren't there? You don't get xp even if you are right next to someone that one hits anything.
---
Most, if not all, of the stuff under that badge is tongue-in-cheek references to Indiana Jones, a very, very fictional archeologist.
---
Last time I was there I had charred ghouls and no wolves.
---
black rider has clipping issues, too.
---
Can I take you up on that offer as well?
---
Eyyyy
---
Eh, I'd rather just get budget increase.
---
It does, I've had no steel but had junk with steel on me making repairs and they'll be auto-scrapped
---
Finished fedora bone task at the Bloatfly cave location while doing bug parts scout daily.

I’ll likely be available for another hour?
---
Yeah, I wonder that too.
---
Morrowind… wear what you wish. Bad ass Orc in a skirt? We got you.
---
Oblivion... that all goes away for some reason, and that carries over into FO3 and NV. In 4, the clothing opens up... but we still have the hairstyle thing.
---
Just open it up.
---
On PC also, never had this happen, did not realize it was a problem.
---
That would only be accurate if the Ski Sword wasn't actually in the game files. It's worse.
---
For example- Camera challenges predate THE ACTUAL CAMERA by what, 2 weeks?-
---
Well you're in luck.  I've got it 5 times and still have one in my inventory.  I'll be on at 5:30 pm PDT if you want it.
---
Same issue as me. Been asking since December for this! Can’t read into the story.
---
Could you perhaps share a link with add-on that does it? or even a site with add-ons would be really nice
---
I'm secretly hoping they are getting rid of the stupid survival mode requirement altogether and just forgot to edit the titles of the challenges
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Wait a second, that's not Nick Valetine!
---
Seriously though, looks great :)
---
All of my armor is named like \~Combat Torso and \~Metal L Arm, just so they all sort to the bottom of my list.  My unyielding vending gear is all named -Vend Torso and -Vend L Arm, which is all neatly sorted to the top of my stash.
---
I use the \~ with [silly weapon names](https://imgur.com/1jJKFN0) to keep them all sorted at the bottom of my list. ([the names](https://imgur.com/1jJKFN0) are in reference to the three guest rooms in Schrute Farms, from The American version of The Office.)
---
Save your breath man ... your arguing with the same people that quit last month because repair kits were "pay to win"
---
That’s unacceptable.. for such a “price”..
---
Thaaat’s right I forgot there was a difference!
---
A little go would formatting a long way...
---
Oh my gosh I hope so. To update: I sold it at 100 in about 5 minutes. 😊
---
i'm completely nude if i'm hanging around my camp and loot bags are bright yellow "so i can see them" BETH.... so go for it I say.
---
But you can elevate them somewhat. I have some concrete steps that go up about a PC's height to get from my crops to my main living level.
---
And in a workshop
---
I assume most of this is just for jokes. Considering how many of these exam questions are just humor, it's probably more intended to just fit a theme. I do agree they should have at least fit it to archeology properly
---
It’s true. Your wife is awesome.
---
I'd like to see the data on that 99% presumption. I’d wager they could make the same if not more money by offering the occasional bundles that include You Choice of a PA Skin, outfit, Camp Item, weapons skin, and emote for a $15.00 price tag or something. Regardless of what you personally prefer I don’t see why there can’t be an option for that. $20 for a season pass or something every 3-4 months.

If there is, it's above 240. That's about the level I got mine. Never spawned at the fair grounds for me (many server hops), two server hops and she appeared at Mothman.
---
All about positioning. Get high ground, let him toss crap at you all day, and just keep picking away at him.
---
Um look at the lid closely, there are air holes
---
I don't think a recipe exists for it. I've only seen it drop from the bug part collecting quest
---
Everyone on here except the banned dupers is enjoying 76 of course you're getting downvoted. It's how we remove trash.
---
I watched like 5 minutes it's the standard FO76 bashing video. Annoying and not funny worst off it exaggerated the problems. No wonder why this game gets so much undeserved hate. 
---
I've been playing since launch I love the game it was never as bad as that fucktard is trying to make it seem.
---
No longer a menu item, we have curdled scorn in its place now.
---
If we get mailboxes I'm totally setting up a weekly or monthly subscription box service.  Woth as many items as this game has, useful and otherwise, I think it would be a blast.

On a controller I press select in the pip boy to change the opacity. Maybe try that

I can meet up with you. What is your gamer tag?

Pictures for us working folk 😂?

did i miss anything? why is my badge without this fedora thingy? what u guys need to do without the visiting and exam stuff?
---
It’s weird that you managed to get that much over: shift your weight reducing perks around and offload on an alt
---
Thanks bro, I've been to a bunch, so far so wood 👌
---
+20 karma 🙌
---
So many awesome suggestions in this thread. I hope Bethesda is listening.
---
Go to treetops and choose a height to jump from that ... oh, you want the swim badge. Hm. Do you have an explosive weapon?
---
I think you really hit it on the head when you said you feel like a dollar sign. That's why I say give us the option for a one time DLC every 3-4 months and then we get this content. Instead of Nickeling' and diming' us to death.
---
Pics plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
---
I can't tell if you're just ranting, or if you genuinely don't understand how these things work.  No, it's not *totally* random, but no one here can tell you how it's done.  But it's not so heavily weighted against *fun* that gambling isn't ever going to result in a good item.
---
No one is saying that the best effects should drop as often as the worst .  It'd be great, but that's not how things work.  Likely (and I'm just guessing here, I haven't looked at that part of the game code), there are common, uncommon, and rare effects.  There are likely also different levels of weapon rarity.  Just like in pretty much every game, ever.  If handmades are on the rare list, you'll find fewer.
---
It also changes over time - all I ever got were pipe weapons and basic shotguns until I was well into my 30s.  I haven't seen either of those in a long time.  I see handmades pretty regularly now though, even though the first one I ever had was around level 40.  I haven't seen a single action revolver in a month either.
---
It's complicated.  You don't understand how it is designed any more than I do.
---
The issue for me is I've been roaming the wastes. Its what I do. Sure, I'll grind a legendary spot here and there but I don't do it daily. So this isn't sending me anywhere new for these quests, plus I've found myself in the same wide area anyway when doing these.
---
This event is not triggered enough. And when I trigger it, nobody comes anymore
---
Spikehawk Female Hairstyle 
---
Well, this is disappointing.
---
:( I bought this wanting a Deathhawk for my guy.
---
Boomer42649 175 per serum won't be on until later though
---
I used wavy Willard's wave pool, and quack dr. I distanced myself from the grenades so that i didn't take the full hit.
---
This! I also have a really hard time hitting people with scoped rifles because the reticule wires (on normal scopes not recon) are so thin that I can hardly see them.
---
I’ve complained a lot about contrast and especially text size. I have no idea why Bethesda makes things so difficult to read.
---
I can tell you that’s not true, at least in my case. I came back to my camp to see my vendor destroyed, I just rebuilt everyone from my camp and all my stuff for sale was still in there
---
^This
---
But it also means 5.6% chance of none working at all.
---
Still very good defense imo
---
I got a 3* lvl 50 drop for defending Sunshine meadow with a level 18 character last weekend.
---
That's awesome thank you. Don't expect you to change your schedule but I'll add you and keep an eye out for when you're on.
---
I’m on the PS4.   However, I believe that its called Perk Loadout Manager.   You should be able to find a link in Reddit or just google it.
---
I just look at like I'm trading in a bunch of crappy 1\* legendary loots for a chance at a less crappy 3\*. If I actually get something awesome, that's a bonus.
---
No, but you can have raised foundations and use them as the entryway stairs, that’s what I exclusively use them for.
---
Does it make you Randy, baby?!
---
I constantly have to look down at the ground in game or look at a wall just to see the sub titles i wish they would allow us to change the color of the text like they did in fo4 i think that would help a lot.
---
What exactly are you looking for?
---
true words. So can i kill you ? :)
---
I never imagined people with mutations they wanted to keep wouldn't be using Starched Genes.  (I personally waited until I had SG2 before even pursuing mutations.)  
---
...but that does explain the frowning emotes I've gotten from some players when they see my vendor is behind a running decontamination shower.
---
Is that really true?
---
Lol the only update we have after the patch is about the Atom Shop. Just in case you guys haven't noticed the first thing that pops up when you log in, we have new stuff you can spend a fortune on!
---
It's apparent to me some of this stuff isn't selling well so they're slashing prices.
---
I'd love marsupial but I also want to browse
---
Ideally Revive me, and let me retire the favor in water haha
---
PC?
---
I always kill what I spawn, and repair things that get destroyed while I'm there.  It's just being a good neighbor.
---
With hunting, you can find 2 Yao guis by the mountain bed and breakfast, and one at Philippine battlefield cemetery. There are black powder weapons at the cemetery as well, which is helpful for the other parts of the challenge. There is a farm south of the nuclear disposal ground workshop with 6 radstags that you can kill for the challenge. For wolves, wait until the leader of the pack event occurs in the forest. I found the challenge easier to complete than the archery challenge.
---
you don't have to kill someone, you just have to revive them
---
It takes place in the forest, where enemy levels are capped pretty low, so that's not happening. But a new version somewhere actually dreary like the mire (maybe dolly sods?) would be rightly terrifying.
---
Thanks bethesda for taking 6 months to release a feature in launch trailers!!!
---
It's a plans... so I can make you one if you have a normal combat helmet
---
i know but to revive someone he needs to die ?
---
I also have this deal of you bring your own stable flux I do it for 50caps
---
yep on pc ign is desertking187
---
At least they're better actors.
---
If*
---
Thanks all for helping me get my head out of my butt. I misread the announcement and thought it was happening today.
---
Yea I have a normal helmet are you on xbox
---
PC. Sorry man
---
Now understand I love this game, it's all I play right now, clocking in at over 700 hours. 
---
I agree that the majority of the hate came from lazy youtubers focusing on bugs and performance issues but that was at beta launch. 
---
There was many initial reasons people hated the concept at that beginning. 
---
Fallout players fear of multiplayers. Forever chanting "it's going to be like fortnite" (yeah yeah I'll wait until nuclear winter comes out before deciding it's a battle royale. I'm not going to trust any youtubers speculation)
---
Bethesda abandoning their "save single player" campaign. 
---
Multiplayers don't have strong stories like the fallout series is known for. 
---
Multiplayers aren't known for having significant consequences to one's actions or branching storylines. 
---
Lore breaking as they've shown brotherhood and supermutants on the east coast far earlier than logically possible. 
---
There may be others but they've slipped my mind. 
---
Once again I agree that youtubers then took the narrative of hate focusing on bugs and ramping that up x1000.
---
I doubt it. I got it with my level 10, level 30, and level 100.
---
I went athlete archer and hacker interesting point for hacker almost all required hacks are contained when launching a nuke so you can get your 1's 2 's and 3's in the same spot plus your complete the launch.  Wait till you see some of the possum challenges looks like an unmoded bag for a while :(
---
Pretty sure the caps are lost at that point. Nothing to prevent sales as far as i know.
---
It is considered a semi automatic  pistol, and benefits from pistol perks.
---
Put a few zzz's first - save yourself needing to go through garbage. Also rename any junk legendary to 1,2, or 3- depending on stars so u remember to throw them in the vending machine
---
You get 0 caps. If you’re at 24,000 and someone buys a 2000 cap item from your vending machine you’ll only get 1000 caps.
---
You want to die in water and revive there and vice versa ?
---
You lose those caps.
---
Dang sorry should have put that there thanks though
---
For reals...top 5 annoying thing at the moment.
---
I was in a three person team, and we had similar problems with the lighthouse.  We took turns quitting the server and rejoining, and that seemed to fix the problem.
---
I personally had no issues completing Hunter, Cook, Athlete, Archer and Swimmer.  The S'mores recipe drops during the Campfire Tales event.  I've already seen a few extra recipes for sale in vending machines.
---
Sending you an invite now
---
I think, more importantly, is the option to swap perk builds on the fly.
---
The game sold like shit, they're trying to recoup their losses.
---
I really want hardwood floors for my camp but $7.00 dude? come one! I wish they would half the prices of everything for one week and promo it. I bet it would do really well.
---
Do you craft the Talons serum?
---
Honestly the fact they attack inanimate objects at all is what annoys me.  Fix their prioritization of targets in camps to be living things.  Like yeah, I'm standing outside in full view  and the wolf takes a B line to munch on a brick wall instead of attack me.... right.
---
Oh, and for the love of baby Chally MooMoo please fix creatures opening locked doors.  I get the humanoids but an opossum shouldn't be opening a level 3 locked door.
---
Yup. Lesson to be learned, dont always trust game reviews these day, form your own opinions. Reviewers have a short amount of time to cram in game content and give their opinion. But games like Fallout 76 gets more and more charming the more you play and get used to everything. If you treat it as just an adventure, you’ll have lots of fun with it.
---
But it's fun when you get a pack of 30+ radstags to plow through! Great to keep me with enough food!
---
The point of the Minuet Men was for you to build them up and give them personality. 
---
Whether that worked well is debatable.
---
Poof!
---
Go to the small pool at the bottom of the serpent  slide in Wavy Willard’s. Take off all armor, agro some scorched, and stand in the pool while they kill you with your ally nearby.
---
Using grenades is a pain in the ass because most of the time they kill you outright.
---
Yeah but then people's camps would be messing up the good spawn points where a lot of 3 star mobs tend to spawn. I got two three star items last night from mobs that spawned next to player camps I FT'd to.
---
I don’t think it’s you. I’ve disconnected from the server twice in one hour doing events. Think there is a server issue.
---
u/Carmen_Willow
---
No,  prolly just 5.56 or whatever AP ammo the Gutseys shoot , I don't remember them dropping any ammo and I am melee and use a shotgun so I wouldn't have picked them up anyway, but it sucked for sure.  I didn't die, but I used a ton of stims.
---
I just kept transferring through the world box shared by my camps. TBH I am glad I caught this early because I could have kept going over.
---
Try to let low level AI enemies or someone with a very, very weak weapon/build do it. Usually they can get you critically injured instead of dead. That's what I did today but not for the swimming one -- concept is the same though. I removed all armor and a lvl 1 and a lvl 6 scorched took a minute or two to take me down. I almost felt bad because I had to follow and trap them in a cabin to get them to keep attacking me.
---
I'm not sure how we did it the other night. The one I was to revive left our team. Then I bashed her once, she bashed me back once. I bashed her one more time to where she was down but not dead. Somehow someone else was able to invite her back to our team and then I revived her in the shallow water. I didn't understand the team invite bit, but it worked.
---
I haven't heard them mention it in a while. Makes me nervous about it...
---
If you repair all or use the repair prompt it doesn't reset the contents, but if you use the store and place trick it was resetting the contents for me.
---
It doesn’t make it the right way to go about it. They’d make more money by respecting the player and putting in more content to the game. More copies would sell off if word of mouth. If you weren’t a fallout fan would you even touch this game? I’m here because I have faith that Bethesda can still be a good company and turn things around. The prices are too high the challenges don’t even matter after they reach do this again 7600 times for the same 20 atoms. If they’d release better content their sales would go up.
---
I don’t meany any disrespect out of this by the way.
---
youtube the combat helmet, there is a static spawn for one and you just gatta scrap them to get the plan for BOS combat helmet. i hope this helps you out
---
The new pale rider seems lack luster compared to the varied skins for the previous three I think it honestly needs a reskin. The rest I guess seemed easier to fit a theme to where as the pale rider give me a white canvas and cult like symbols but why not just make it more bone like and give it dismembered bones where it is anatomically correct.... I mean are we not talking about death himself here I'm not spending any atoms on this because they have released it already and their is no going back, but I would like Bethesda to please give us a Halloween cannibal Power Armor Skin with bones strewn about.
---
PS Bethesda before you go and message me..... Yes }:( you can take my idea and copyright it like all the mods you claimed and sold to us during fallout 4's creation club debauchery I just want to see more commitment and dedication to the community like you have been with these skins I love what is happening just a concerned gamer wanting to see the best from our favorite open world developers
---
Please upvote I want Bethesda to see these ideas and act upon them 
---
Love you all
---
Never had this happen to me.  I play on PC with a modest gaming rig.  
---
Maybe try re-validating your files and possibly re-install?  Sounds like there's a conflict occurring.
---
Yup, purchasing this cosmetic ensures you keep free dlc. No need to thank me.
---
Glad to hear it. All my characters are encumbered so it's goong to take me longer than most to complete. Especially running 4 of them consecutively. Lol
---
I think the CAMP desperately needs a path/sidewalk/driveway/parking lot functionality. We build these really cool houses, barns, stores, warehouses, etc, but they just exist by themselves in the middle of a field. It's kind of immersion breaking depending on what look you're going for.
---
I decided to do the archer quest and finally got the bag, and yeah the possum challenges look like a handful lmao
---
I didn’t mean to come across as cynical. I was just making an observation :)
---
Jump from the rope bridge at the Charleston Herald, landing in the small stream below. Instant death in shallow water; teammate can revive. Also make sure you have regular stims -- neither diluted nor super will work.
---
Yaaaaay!  As long as you are happy.
---
hmmm i've changed mine to white though. you're talking about text and HUD right? or what am i missing
---
Character looks great! Really mad max raider esque
---
10 1 star nocturnal  and 1 3 star Item. I think it is ok
---
Looking forward to that happening. Hey, variety! Lol
---
I’m a “CAMP Building Enthusiast” and I’ve rebuilt entirely my CAMP yesterday, and everything went fine. It’s actually better than a few weeks ago.
---
Still got that plan?
---
Or the Ranger Station down in Cranberry Bog.  There's already a little camp/picnic area across the dirt road from the main door that has no current use other than a good place to take pictures of beavers.
---
I just recently got mine, I’m level 45, I literally server hopped at the water park for about 30 minutes and he popped up!
---
Ah yeah, true. 
---
My main I purposely went around finding as many locales as I could. Didn't feel like doing it on the alt so I've been "rediscovering" quite a few.
---
np iv heard it could take a few of them to learn it but at least its a good way to get them constantly
---
Allow myself to introduce..... myself.
---
I've got 800+ hours in the game. I've found one 2* Handmade and less than a dozen 1* Handmade's. I found two 3* single action revolvers in less than 1 hour the other day.
---
I know exactly how the math works. Assuming a fair RNG there is roughly a 1 in 72,000 chance that you get the weapon that you're looking for. You can only spin for 10 weapons a week. So it could theoretically take you 720 weeks to find the legendary that you are looking for. I'd say that is enough......no need to make it even harder than a 1 in 72,000 chance.........a money hungry CEO apparently disagrees with me.
---
Melee build viable, heavy gun build viable, rifle build really really viable, but yeah wish I can be more creative with builds without sacrificing performance, hard to do when optimizing a certain skill set or being a “specialist” pay off so well
---
I’m having trouble finding robot armor plans, also. Elusive things.
---
Also completely unethical ways of doing his archaeology lol
---
Hey if your on ps4 i have the spawn held for the pro snap camera psn: Raulsegovia357
---
Right. But aren’t we hoping for something REALLY cool?
---
bashing enemies degrades it faster than shooting stuff
---
and you can repair it when it's at 99% condition, too, you don't have to wait until it's completely broken
---
I knew reddit could complain even about virtual frog in a bottle.
---
Oh no I had to use 1/100th of my materials to repair my camp so I didn't have to pay 50 caps to move it and use 1/300th of my caps balance to move my camp a few inches for a no materials rebuild. You have truly ruined me.
---
You should reevaluate how you spend your time because you're wasting it.
---
I've got a camp on a bridge on the river leading from morgantown, I popped some foundations under the bridge and bam. walls were a bit weird tho
---
Yeah, totally based on wez from road warrior. Except no feathers or hair dye, lol.
---
I don't think you get XP from enemies killed by turrets, but they did fix it recently so that you can still loot them.
---
Harley99c
---
Don't fix it to 200% and take off the weapon perk that increases the weapons durability.
---
Also bashing enemies with the crossbow damages it so you can fix it
---
I don’t use turrets at all.
---
In wavy willards parking lot.  Serverhopped twice and tourist was laying up against one of the only cars in the parking lot.  Two of my friends had the same experience.
---
Repair all works for me
---
My cabin already looks like a Wellington Hipster bar with white shag carpet, going to go full twee with this when I get home.
---
I'll add you I'd like to buy a couple marsupials if possible.
---
Could not find
---
I built a base once that was just all succulents, just wanted to see how many I could build, the answer is a disgusting amount. I soon deleted the camp due to it being entirely useless. But oddly soothing.
---
My guess it that they were moving around perk cards. My build requires me to swap cards to  do task like super duper, chemist  and ammo crafting. They probably just forgot, I know I do when I forget to switch to lone wander after using hard bargain.
---
look for the low condition one that spawns at the place
---
I wish I had a friend like you, I've been constantly struggling to have more than just 4,000 caps at any given time, much less the 11,500 I need for the neon.
---
Todd gets them instead...
---
Yeah, I'm starting to fear that item decoration will be limited to display cases.
---
I don’t mean any disrespect either. But, I believe in being honest and facts don’t care about your feelings. We are paying for their mistakes, literally. It’s not right and its upsetting to me. Me and my little brother were talking about it this weekend. He just said Bethesda man? I asked what about it.  He told me how disappointed he was because he felt like it was the last standing studio making games with the focus being on for the fans and this is the same reason he stopped playing Destiny. 
---
Fallout 4 had a less than great story. But, other than that it was so good man. Bethesda is going to end up like Bungie or EA. Honestly a lot of people have already jumped ship. 
---
If you're on Xbox mt Gt is NotBestButOk
---
I assume it will also work similar to how bookcases worked in Skyrim
---
When you scrap him, does the frog stay in your inventory so you can easily remake the habitat?
---
I've enjoyed the update overall, I've also had to rethink locks and such on some of my doors and containers in my CAMP, but that didn't take very long once I decided what I wanted people to be able to access - which is most things. 
---
I like people coming to my CAMP, shopping around a bit and then looking at what I spent hours on building. I also like seeing what other people have built and exploring their camps. I think Player Vending has been a great addition.
---
Not to be that guy, but i'm about to be that guy: i've seen one (1) ghoul at my C.A.M.P. I've played for a number of hours. I've had customers. No enemies. Also i've never spawned any at other C.A.M.P.s. Not bragging, just honestly surprised. Wouldn't have known this was an issue if i hadn't seen posts about it. I wonder why i'm S.P.E- er, different.
---
I'll look you up in about 20 minutes
---
and the can chimes for an easy 75 steel and lead.
---
Hopefully there will be a display case I can put my pies in.    
---
Also hope that weapon displays will properly show mods.
---
The problem was that it wasn't released in its current state. Technical issues, bad community engagement/ communication and patch implementation all contributed to the growing dumpster fire that was this game.
---
Now its definitely moved away from 'objectively shit' to 'it might just not be for you' territory.
---
And those saying people who dislike the story or its implementation do so because they need it spoon fed to them need to go play in traffic.
---
Oh... Very interesting
---
I don't know wheter to praise you or hate you.
---
Bash, repair, bash repair
---
Codebreaker was relatively painless as well, hardest part was finding the 0 difficulty terminals to hack.
---
Thanks bro 👍🏻
---
You can
---
And they also promised free DLC for life. That's not wrong, and I said nothing here about ditching microtransactions.
---
It didn't.  You couldn't give them personality, just go from settlement to settlement needing help.
---
ehhhhhh… not so sure. Just my $0.02, but I'd hate to see this become a "I ain't  getting outta bed for less than $10,000" kinda game. Where you need some sort of guarantee that you're gonna get what you want.
---
I get stuck at armor benches
---
anti armor + explosive is the current meta
---
or bloodied
---
I love the idea of an accompanying app, but not sure how practical this particular example would be. 
---
Me personally, i can't play with one hand. So i wouldn't be able to maintain control of my character and use the app simultaneously anyway. 
---
Not to mention taking my eyes off screen to look at phone. Currently you can adjust setting so pipboy is transparent even outside of Power Armor. This allows me to see enemies while i manage my inventory.
---
Witty little comment
---

---
Obviously you need the mutations already mentioned and the most important thing are the emergency protocols for the Power armor.
---
Use the rest of the perk points for whatever you like. But with these perks you're already doing pretty well. Maybe max out tenderizer or suppressor or some endurance perks like lifegiver or get some vats perks. It's up to you and your playstile. Do not use serendipity though since it doesn't work in PA.
---
Because with an MTX store they can bring new content updates out for *everyone*. Whereas if they had no MTX and made you pay for a DLC pack only a small percentage of people, especially for this game, would buy it and the playerbase would be split.
---
This model works best.
---
Not sure. I haven't completed the challenge myself.
---
You said "Possum uniform" and no one wants to know what i imagined.
---
The system isn't broken.  They're not saying that if you move, you'll never see mob spawns near your base again.  But if you move to a lower-level area with weaker mobs, they'll be inconsequential and probably can be dealt with exclusively by your turrets.
---
I might have to add some dirt and stuff to my raider characters. Been rocking the welder goggles for a while though!!
---
Hard Bargain perk card brings it down quite considerably if you have that one maxed out. Cost over 9k.
---
The lore about their history adds to their personality.
---
I had an idea but wasn't sure. Thanks.
---
I think they are trying to drive people to that game mode. Since it seems like they are scrapping a lot of pvp in adventure, I think they want to have a viable option for those interested
---
Craft the lowest level you can. Don’t have any cards that increase its condition or keep it from degrading at a normal rate. Go somewhere where there’s a lot of enemies to just smack down.  
---
Repair it once you can, don’t wait for it to be really low. Rinse and repeat.
---
#ad?
---
I can make you one, GT?
---
The perk!! Thank you I forgot about that!
---
Oh you can. It's just more like 76's environmental storytelling with your settlement building.
---
Tacogod2000
---
Great job! love seeing inventive C.A.M.Ps like this :) I've never really been around the Mire - is that purple light always there or did you build that from the workshop menu?
---
Crank down your gamma. ;P
---
Kk i'll join and team inv. Come to my camp!
---
Oh okay, another player claimed otherwise - I haven't confirmed for myself. Appreciate the clarification.
---
It’s risky considering the amount of time some people put into the game. I personally would wait until it’s actually supported. You aren’t just risking $15, you’re risking all the playtime you’ve accumulated and your personalised character. Also, developers of games don’t go through potential cheaters and pick and choose who deserves a ban, that’s done by software and it doesn’t care what you’re using a mod for or how innocent it is.
---
Are you being purposefully obtuse?
---
If one ammo weighs 1, and one ammo weighs 0.01 then one of them is objectively very heavy compared to the other. Everyone always complains about how heavy missiles are, and cannonballs are half their weight, which is still a significant amount heavier than common ammo types. Being the joint 4th heaviest ammo along side plasma cores, after missiles, fusion cores, and mini nukes.
---
Its lvl 10 mobs breaking my fences from 200 yards away
---
Plants work pretty well for me and produce around 17 per hour.
---
This is really close to mine
---
!LegL(STR/Sent)Met
---
Yeah 😂 happens all over the place. Looks absolutely hilarious
---
Make sure too if your are running unyielding, to be at full health when crafting a crossbow for this challenge. Make a regular x-bow kill one thing repair rinse and repeat 3x.
---
The possum badges for the world challenges are guaranteed, but the possum badges for dailies and the "Campfire Tales" event are like a 25% chance or some shit like that. Good luck!
---
Survival Mode reward. Enjoy!
---
Character #3 - PVP Bloodied/Unyielding (good for PVE damage too).  This is the guy with the Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, Bloodied Explosive Handmade, and Bloodied Explosive Combat Shotgun.  Lots of fun, but high risk to get the most out of it (requires you to be just under 30% health).  A lot of people use Nerd Rage, but I find it underwhelming and am not comfortable running at under 20% health.
---

Ur appearing offline
---
I like the idea, for people like you, or anyone, there should be an "opt in" to receive messages
---
While I'm in agreement that the responders while alive were very admirable, I still want a Laser Musket.
---
Haha what are you doing there. Get radiated and than do a high jump on the stairs in the water so you low on hp ;) 
---
I wanted to offer you the marsupial serum to speed this up.
---
Please tell me irrigation is a pipe weapon 😂😂😂
---
Thank you very much. I find building to be somewhat therapeutic lol
---
I put the light from the workshop myself, added that purple light by the chem vending machine and the orange one that turns on with the rad shower. 
---
All the power comes from one fusion generator (which i couldn’t show because of Betsy Boop) by conduit pipes
---
Sry about that should be fixed
---
I paid 3k for mine. I've yet to get it once from the event. Might want to raise your price. That's pretty low for a plan that only drops randomly from an event.
---
Couldn't remember off hand what it was called whilst I was on the bus lol
---
But the perk is gunsmith
---
Ugh! Wish I looked as t my phone! Haha
---
The Arktos Pharma will have the stimpack diffuser. I think it's the only one you can't complete right now.
---
Now only if there were raider armor plans (light, sturdy, heavy) available in the game or purchasable at Raider vendors.
---
{Chest
---
{RA
---
{RL
---
{LA
---
{LL
---
{Under
---
Puts everything at the end of the list
---
Holy shit how much has Bethesda screwed up with this update? Dupes, can’t learn some backpack plans, impossible challenges (the medical one), and this. I’m probably missing some still.
---
*Jesus.*
---
Then kill them irl. You have your right to defend yourself and have proof of them wanting to harm you. I'll happily kill someone in broad daylight if they threaten me first.
---
😂 nooooot sure why but still
---
Idk getting bent over kinda rules tho.
---
Yeah. I have plans for the chest and legs. I don't know where I got them though or how long I've had them. Lol
---
Conspiracy suit is underarmor
---
Wtffffff
---
Lol...all the bases covered.
---
And theyve really taken any point of survival mode by allowing these challenges to be completed in adventure mode....and the new vending, which is everyones focus right now.
---
And before anyone feels the need to tell me...yes i m sure its a bug...and yes, im sure u still play survival mode all day
---
I picked up a hide last night from Blackwater Mine inside a metal box in the area where Uranium Fever happens. It helps to have leather tagged for pick up as it will catch your eye better than without it being tagged.
---
On PS4, hold PS button and press square.
---
It’s a machete.
---
I have talons and marsupial.  B1SHOP11
---
I’ve got several available as well. B1SHOP11
---
And this is why I built my CAMP away from any places that spawn enemies.
---
25 caps each
---
I buy them at 25. But you may find higher. No one really buys forest maps tho.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
You're in the wrong sub. That's the one you want.
---
That sucks but why would you carry all that junk around. Rule #1, don't carry your junk. If you die, someone is gonna take that stuff. May want to start offloading all the weapons you don't use out of your stash. Dump all your ammo that you don't use, no sense in collecting it if your not going to use it. Just all around better stash management. Mine sits around 600 and is literally full of junk and whatever 60 items I'm putting in my vendor. I don't store any aid/food items cause they can weigh a ton in you stash. 
---
Sorry for your loss though
---
I mean it seems like proper progression. Now that the scorchplague is gone by killing the Queen hypothetically people can move back ^maybe ^in ^the ^wastelanders ^dlc ^please
---
Solos have been glitchy as f from day 1. Sometimes all the turrets are already destroyed and are just lying on the floor. Other times they’re destroyed but look like they aren’t, in perfect condition but on the floor. Other times they’re fine, and other times they’re fine until halfway through the silo when they all self destruct.
---
Robots are buggy too. Sometimes they all suicide right at the start, sometimes they barely spawn, sometimes they overspawn. At the end, after the prep is complete and you can enter your keycard, all the robots that are still alive are meant to instantly die but sometimes a few stay alive or respawn or something. It’s all random and Bethesda haven’t fixed it yet.
---
I sell them for 10 caps and they move quickly.
---
You misunderstand. That's the advice. Not telling you to think for yourself.
---
They don’t even mark settlements on my map. FAIL!
---
I normally buy them for anywhere between 25-40 caps, depending on region. I'll pay on the higher end of that scale for cranberry bog maps
---
BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I always forget how old skyrim is, coming up on a decade. The arrow in the knee joke seems older somehow. LMFAO had some dude limping around with a arrow in his knee in some shitty music video they made. That was around when scene kids made me feel old for the first time. Like, what the hell is wrong with these kids. Oh shit, I'm old now. And today you see adults post to blunderyears about what cringy scene kids they were.
---
You don't even have to do the challenges either. I got mine last week just by being at my camp. Did nothing special. Pretty sure a lot of people are just getting it by some random bug and they don't even realize they got it.
---
I love it. It’s harder than it should be to keep my store stocked. But I’ve picked up excellent weapons cheap and sold good (not god) weapons cheap that aren’t right for my build. I find magazines and bibbleheads go quickly. And I love picking up cheap plans. Finally got pianos yesterday for ten caps!
---
why do people lock water your not going to sell it and kinda nice feature of visiting a camp to look at your stuff for sale.  I leave mine unlocked and still have lots of water for my own use.
---
Bought 2 Serum Plans last night for 2400 each.
---
ghoul ghoul dolls
---
Awesome! You really have a great eye for detail and planning. Really good job, I hope you get lots of visitors that show appreciation with heart emotes ❤️
---
New back pack shovel skin looks great too
---
Still bugged
---
Some things you just can't get out of shag carpeting.
---
Try scrolling through the warning signs under floor decorations maybe?
---
well the last one the requirements were pretty minimal
---
Im in Harper's ferry right behind you on PC. I put up 30 mags for 25 caps each on Saturday and have only sold 1. Think i might have to go down to 20 or 18.
---
Don't. Carry. Your. Junk. This game is explicitly designed so you Can't. Hoard. All. Teh. Junk. Don't do it.
---
Any of them still available by chance?
---
You will never be able to go and pick 17 corn off one plant. Just like resource collectors, everything has a set max limit before production stops. You'd have to sit around your camp and collect your plants every 5 minutes or so, only then would it be possible to gain the 17/hr.
---
Can’t upvote this enough.  I paid close attention to the story on my second run and I think it’s really well done.  First run I got the outline/cliff notes but I felt it was well put together.
---
I believe it also unlists if your stash gets blown up by enemies when someone is there. I know I tend to fix things that get broken when visiting other people's camp and enemies spawn around me, so it's not impossible something like that happened to you. 
---
IDK, it is what it is.
---
Yea i didnt want to put them for too much because then nobody would want them
---
I’m fine with it. It keeps the challenge of finding legendaries, and helps out poleople who aren’t lucky enough to find 3 star legendaries on 3 star enemies.
---
Afraid not. Unless they've changed it in a recent patch, once it's seen that your camp is blocked it autostores it and will stay in storage until you place it again.
---
Haha :) No worries ;)
---
Gimmie a break, I dont remember the last time I crafted a stimpack or even farmed for them. 
---
If you take the same build and give it a prime bloody rifle and run around at 20% health it'll do more damage than a zealots will. And it will do it to any enemy you shoot. I just like using less ammo, but you do you.
---
Archery range at that pioneer camp, it was very glitchy for me though.  It would show it and I would select read, but it never went in.  Had to server hope a bunch of times.
---
Ty just looked but not there..
---
Thanks for this...
---
Nope not what happend never been destroyed but thx for feedback
---
Just found a kind stranger ingame, thanks though :)
---
I was so so so so so sad when I realized I couldn’t place my perfectly preserved pie on the table in my camp...
---
It will be there the next time. I've done it multiple times.
---
The best effects are now bloodied, anti armor, and furious for primaries, explosive, fire rate for secondaries, and weightless and DR for the minor effect.
---
Still selling that Marsupial Serum? And how much? Haha
---
No pick but my character has it and I like it more than the yellow box
---
haha you can have it for free if you tp to me
---
I rarely get that message and yesterday i press "Stay on this world".I had no camp.I didn't try to place it and just left. Then i joined a new server and my camp was in the right place. Not sure if it's intended or not, just wanted to share what i've noticed.
---
Looks like your machine can't handle it. Mine doesn't look like that
---
No problem
---
That is not true. I have done this several times and as soon as i changed server my camp was right where i left it
---
I suspect it's me, and not the content. Awhile back I posted a defense for using turret bases at Whitespring by labelling anyone who raged against the tactic as an a-hole (an opinion I still by, though I've never personally used that tactic); plus, anyone looking at my profile has a pretty good idea of where I stand on the political spectrum, and it's not exactly looked favorably upon by the Reddit thought police. 
---
I take that back, it's probably both; I had the audacity to also praise a Libertarian thinker.
---
also, its kinda hard to see him, the glass is so foggy
---
yeah my challenges completed themselves last week
---
Server hop and if the next world has the spot free it will appear.
---
I'm just thinking that they put in all the work to get that app working, it seems like a bit of a waste to not implement something similar into future games. 
---
I got the pip boy edition of 4, and had a lot of fun using it instead of the one in game.
---
I do not, I have only one charisma with my current build.
---
So are most of the Minutemen.
---
Yea it could be done accidently last week and again this week (if you play with friends alot). Because this week you need to be in a team and claim workshop, revive an ally, do a quest and kill scorchbeast..
---
I’d like to add you to get a Grounded serum. Might be a while before our timing sync up.
---
Yup i read the requirements and i never did them. In survival or adventure. So not sure how i triggered it, just know i got it.
---
But now all of the legendary items worthy even that shitty ones because you can use them for better item
---
How much does it increase carry weight by?
---
I mean, how would you know it got blown up if a super mutant with a missile launcher blew it up while you were away, and whoever was shopping fixed it before they left?
---
I believe you, I mean I don't know how closely you watch your camp, I can spend entire sessions never once going near mine.
---
Mmmmm cocoa powder
---
Platform?
---
my kingdom for card load outs I hear ya brother if I had a dime for every time I face a mob with my crafting perks armed.  hopefully load outs are coming in some future patch :)
---
It must have changed then. Good to know thanks, :)
---
Yes. As long as you don’t place it. It will be where you had it.
---
Mr sandman // please make me cream // slob on my knob // if you know what i mean. 
---
I'm sorry
---
Everywhere else was fine, but when i move to this spot it looks like this.

Sorry Raven. That has changed.  Cheers
---
just go to the penitentiary facility, it has all the levels of code breaking for terminals in there, do 0-3 then jump to a new server and repeat.
---
I feel like the pale rider is a huge let down I really wanted it to be more death designed like the grim reaper. The black rider looks like it got a hood kinda in the details I feel like they missed the mark a little. Tho I definitely got the war and black rider because I think they are cool regardless of fitting the look but it ultimately it is their artistic design. I just wanted the death to be bad ass like maybe even a spectre look, maybe smokey or an actual hood covering the face like ratty cloth really make it mysterious. Just bummed is all.
---
Right now right now lol  right now only
---
I think by 60.
---
   Backpack lvl 50+ High Capacity mod = 120 carry weight. But there's a huge downside ....  -60 defense against radiation and energy . Doesn't bother me much since i play a stealth sniper and i don't get hit that much but it might be a deal breaker for others.
---
I sit at my camp when people can fast travel to it and turn off the power when I leave so no one can fast travel to it
---
Alright for those of you who will ever find this and are in a similar position. Reinstalling did do the job but be aware, all stuff jn your vending machine has to be set on sale again.
---
Beat me to it, but yeah, it would be nice. But to avoid abuse I think a player should be able to set it so only friends can give items, otherwise dupers could off-load large quantities of duped items into random player's mail boxes and get them in trouble.
---
Thanks for this!!  
---
As someone who sucks at terminals (meaning that it takes way too long if I want to get through)- I hardly ever do them and still have not unlocked 32 of them since the b.e.t.a. so figured this would take forever...  
---
Thanks again
---
I always tell people "the only thing you get from forest maps is encumbered".
---
You're going to enjoy it, at least for awhile. 
---
Where I am, I still enjoy it...but. So, I'm done the main quest and most of the main parts of the rest. I haven't launched a nuke yet because I haven't found a party willing to do it with me in the small amounts of time I have to play, but, that's okay. 
---
So, what I am trying to do now is 1. Get some great legendary weapons and armor, which is hard, and 2. complete challenges and merit badges (new). But the grind is holding me back. Because of the need for repair, I have to carry multiple weapons. Because I chose shotguns, I have to grind plastic, which can take hours sometimes to really stock up, and it gets old. I'm trying to complete the merit badges, but some of them require things like collecting certain issues of a magazine.. which can randomly spawn almost anywhere in the world and are hard to find and if you do find it, it's a random magazine. Same with bobbleheads though I seem to have better luck finding those. So you kill hordes of bad guys in the hope that one spawns as a legendary, and hope it drops a legendary you can use, until you finally run out of ammo, then limp back, fix your guns, and grind for ammo for awhile, then maybe hit a bunch of places and hope to find a magazine or other collectable. 
---
It's still fun, I do still enjoy it, I just am not really pumped anymore. About half my sessions are wasted with at least somewhat boring grinding. And I don't have long to play.
---
ugh yeah i looked, and its pretty bad... i take back what i said earlier, you do seem to be a pretty bad person
---
agreed, we're 6 months into this game lifecycle and they really need a wake up call. Their is still a small chance they'll put all of their man power and energy into making this a playable game. The community hasn't given up and I don't think Bethesda will either
---
The power plant near Charleston has a level 3 terminal outside. Also some terminal around the flooded train yard near Watoga. The Atlas Observatory has some level 1 and 0 terminals I think.
---
I know one thing for sure if you could vendor backpacks you could sell them for 5k ezzzz i would have bought one for sure I ended up having to do the hacker cause I havn't got the camera yet on a postive note ended up with a metric tonne of circuits after that run and some flux after nuking white springs.  The possum challenges are some next lvl shit for sure
---
Yeah they need to do something about this. I’m literally repairing dozens of destroyed walls, generator, extractor, and plants every day.
---
I had a good laugh when it was announced that the legendary vender is female.  It turns I have been saving all my legendary wood for a female vender!  I know it is childish and immature, but the thought just popped into my head.  What are the odds I would be saving a specific item that I considered to be very low of value only to have circumstances like this occure?  I couldn't help it!
---
Definitely, i agree with you. It be nice to have an accompanying app. Even if it doesn't really improve functionality. It would still enhance the experience of some players. Especially if you enjoy role playing and immersing yourself further into the game. Adding additional functionality would just be a bonus!
---
I strongly disagree. The best cosmetic content in the game is only obtainable by paying additional money.  They’ll make money now but those profits will be offset and lost in the future because of the huge loss of respect for Bethesda in the gaming community. This sub are the one’s that stuck around. However the people who have a negative opinion of Bethesda FAR outweigh the ones who actually play the game. 
---
There's no point in us arguing this anymore. But, let's see where Bethesda is in 1-2 years.
---
commanders charge, its a civil war sword with 40% faster attack speed, furious, and 1 agility, comes with electric mod its pretty nice for a 3 pound sword
---
As I have heard t camps can not be destoryed in survial either without attacking the player leading to people setting up shops, locking the doors so you fast travel in to an empty vender, locked doors and a room full of turrets that kill you
---
agree
---
Just see better lol
---
That's what happened to me with the neverending stream of gutsys.  That little pea shooter they have tears me straight up right through my PA and I'm not one of those guys who thinks Excavator is PA.
---
I am wearing excavator armor with a bone helm and chest.
---
I’ll take them all. About to log on
---
found the dupers! they duped themselves!
---
You can wear a hat but no bandana.
---
They are yours
---
haha weird
---
But but... It's 16 times the detail!
---
Any xo1 mods?
---
Yeah, I really wish we had ammo types like New Vegas. Instead we have receivers and they just straight up change the ammo type. With a prime receiver that gun ONLY takes ultracite ammo. Thus the “dedicated” part of my statement.
---
This would be pretty fun. I know Darker Nights is one of my must have mods in FO4. Brings a whole new level to nighttime exploration. Sometimes pretty terrifying too.
---
You guys really have to stop spinning the narrative that youtubers somehow ruined the the games launch.                                                         The game released in an abysmal state that took many months of patches to get up to par, and accompanied by the shit show of the accidental doxxing, false advertising, tone deaf responses from the dev team, ect, it deserved every bit of hate it got. Yes, the game is better now and I've (mostly) enjoyed my 100ish hours, but those have still been marred by frequent frame drops, lag, disconnects, invincible enemies, and broken quests.                                                                                   Lying to late adopters doesn't do anyone any favors. They should know the actual story.
---
Bashing the Yao Guai with the Syringer also counts. I went to Phillipi Cemetery and did that with the low lvl one there.
---
I think you should they havent added any human npcs but lots of enemies and story
---
Yes, but all gone
---
You are a gentleman. I'll be on later tonight.
---
Nice carpet
---
I lost all progress in the BOS quest line this morning after my server dumped me. I was literally in the middle of the last step of the quest. It’s very frustrating. I don’t even have a prompt in my pipboy to start it over. Nor do I really WANT to start over.
---
im kinda scared they will not just let us place any junk we want, but make us choose from a limited list of things 
---
i just want tons of gnomes and teddy bears
---
Yeah i read a different post where someone said it can be triggered if your'e at someone elses camp when they log off. 
---
Don't know if that's true, but that wasn't the case for me as i was crafting chems at my own camp when i got it.
---
i just go and collect every time im in camp, and theres usually only 10% of plants that have anything on them. 
---
So 1/17th of a hour is 3.5 minutes, so everything should spawn if i spend that time in camp, but nothing or almost nothing grow, i will do a 10 minute test and see what happens.
---
Lol never seen those turret conditions but now that I really think about it I remember a couple of weeks back I hacked a terminal in a silo and thought it was bugged when it said 38 turrets connected.
---
... What?
---
Assumptions will take you nowhere, btw.
---
#for some reason i keep hearing useless shit from people who haven't reached endgame yet. my friend and I have each made over 100k playing pvp, its now down to zero. but then again why am i talking to you , go level up and reach endgame then maybe you can comment
---
Thanks, Bot.
---
If they make it so enemies don’t spawn near camps you can forget about farming in Whitesprings. They should just buff turrets or make them more reliable. I still don’t understand why we can only build low level turrets.
---
When you get here, be patient while I drop them.
---
They probably just spawn inside your house, no?
---
dont you also have to launch a nuke for that one?
---
I wish I got any of those. I built in a pond on the gold course at Whitesprings and I’m constantly getting attacked my Bloodrage Mirelurks.
---
I think the entire Mirelurk family is probably the biggest pain in the ass due to their tough shells and pretty hard hitting attacks.
---
As someone that suffers from migraines: no plz
---
Well if you get something you don't like you can at least trade it in for 40 more scrips. So you're only out 60 really.
---
My 2 shot beam splitting light em on fire laser sniper is perfect for tagging. Does minimal damage and I know they are tagged if burning.
---
I swear I thought you wrote "pure cuntpaste wastelanders" at first...which wouldn't have been any less accurate, really. 😆
---
Hmm you might just be bugged then. Some of my plants weren't producing a while back, even after 30  minutes. I ended up moving them, some i stored and placed them again.. some i even scrapped and replanted.... eventually they all produce now. You may want to run some tests and do the same.
---
They need a better texture, it's as bad as the white one, and looks like porous stone, or sponge.
---
Same, I lost all 4 vending machines and it remembered everything.
---
I dunno I shot pretty much every dog I came across in that game
---
Back when I was a very little kid, I caught a horned toad and put it in a jar.  My mom told me I needed to poke holes in the lid so it could breathe.  I tried to take the lid back off, but it was stuck fast.  I panicked because I knew the horned toad was going to die if it didn't get air, so I threw the jar against the side of the house and a piece of glass...well, you can probably surmise what happened to the toad. I never put anything alive in a jar again.
---
haha. but i have to sleep now. It's late in germany. Maybe tomorrow we can deal :)
---
I haven’t played in a few months but I do appreciate reading these posts that mention issues being fixed that people bring up and ask to be addressed.
---
Ill stop by once im done with my shop
---
Yes, there are people who buy them regularly. I've seen 25-50 caps for non-forest.
---
You don't get stuff from them?
---
I’ll stop by
---
You think that's bad try to read your menu using the chameleon mutation and weightless armor 😂🤣
---
Strategic placement is the name of the game. Up high and with a clear line of sight of where enemies are most likely to be. I am camped by the deathclaw and ant spawn north of Watoga. They've never made it past my turrets, even when I'm not helping to kill them.
---
I had SO MANY DAMN PLANS in my notes. I had NO IDEA you had to “activate them” thanks a bunch dude!
---
Gone
---
Is it straining your eyes that does it?
---
Lvl 3 Lead Belly eliminates rads from food and ingested water. So this would eliminate the rads when you cannibalize. It's also a big point investment. Fewer points in it mitigate less radiation.
---
Alternatively, if your level is high enough to have a point in Sun Kissed, for half the day, you will be virtually rad free. This would free up more points in Endurance vs lvl 3 Lead Belly.
---
Otherwise, maybe just take a radx before cannibalizing. Or just take Radaway after.
---

This is my "daily driver" bloodied gear build.  I'll also swap the shotgun cards out for 2h melee cards on occasion. I swap out picklock/butchers bounty/green thumb as needed in Perception. I wish there was a reasonable way to get rid of through-hiker to swap in Dodgy, but i use a lot of booze in my build, so If I don't have through hiker and traveling pharmacy, I'm over encumbered all the time anyway.   
---
As for "YOU MUST HAVE" minimums... Perception of 3, for level 3 lockpick. Int of 5, for max tier crafting cards. Everything else is "What works for you"
---
Definitely
---
haaaaaaaaaa. That's awesome.
---
Glad I could help.
---
I have a level 35 explosive,furious gatling laser I had it since the game came out. damage wise it isnt insane when you first start hitting an enemy but then furious kicks in and it melts whatever it hits I dont use it alot though because it takes about 3 cores before its dead
---
Well i get your point and sure take that in count that they could have screwed up in a few cases maybe also overreacted but... 
---
Nevertheless the excuse of using/having an (expected ultra-) rare item/ammo as "shadow currency" in such amounts which are heard is just not reasonable imo.
---
All in all - duper/traded with duped items/acted as mule for those purposes - support in any way by using/profit of exploits is not right.
---
How long does some one have to be dead before it’s called archaeology and not grave robbing.
---
nothing worthwhile, unless you are looking for weapons to scrap.
---
“Some more air holes” directly from the title.
---
Biggest problem for me lately, is that every time I move my camp, it breaks my house down into 15+ blueprints of 1 square each. So foundation square with a tinkers workbench, then another with a stove, and another for every single square of foundation or flooring.
---
Play fallout NV
---
you can create a 2nd character to use as a mule for your extra stuff
---
Confirmed. Bravo works.
---
The story is the same and no human npcs have been added so if you didn't like it then you probably won't like it now. They added a bit of content but not much and the bugs...every patch brings new bugs.
---
As far as I know it works the same as water, where your camp can produce a total of 17/hrs, regardless of the number of plants (so in theory, plant 17 of something and in an hour they should all be ready to harvest). However, also like water, it doesn't seem to produce nearly that much.
---
Please bear in mind that I do not in any way endorse this YouTube channel.

Is just the first of many results when I searched for 'Garrahan Estate Minigun':

---
Thats good to know
---
This would be way more taxing on server stability than a budget increase.  
---
Maybe give you an option of which to use when you log in so that your main camp remains in place- this is why i don't use the tiny shop I made back in December since it is almost impossible to replace my primary camp.  
---
I still think we need a "public market" on a separate instance server which allows for hundreds of vault dwellers to claim non-contestable store fronts- something like the top of the world, just with more "shop spaces"
---
Oh no, I'm having fun in an online video game. What a waste of time.
---
Should follow your own advice in that case.
---
I agree!
---
Everyone’s different try it for yourself I enjoy it myself started first day of beta.
---
love in the wasteland is hard to find
---
Pics! Pics! Pics!
---
Most people seem to sell them for between 20-50. I’ve sent a couple people sell them for 200. I put a few in my machine for 30 and they sold pretty quick.
---
You can also grab the one at the archery range at Palace of The Winding Path, that one's always trashed.
---
What do you use?  I’m at a ruined pylon near the monorail elevator.  I put them low and they don’t kill a thing.  Put them high and my junk extractor gets leveled.  I’ve tried machine guns and missile.
---
It will be OK, you will survive. Here, has some Dark Nuke-Cola, its what the wasteland plants crave!
---
I love the fact that the OP who made the list, is a responder...
---
Wish they would just spawn inside.  Where I camp I have all neutral spawns but every once in a while I get bees that attack.  No humanoids at all so I would just have frogs foxes chickens cats possums and squirrels running around inside my little castle and it would be amazing.
---
Right.  I hate those bastages the most.  Or maybe it's Mirelurk Kings I hate the most.  I don't know, it's a toss up for sur.
---
Not according to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnrwq3/so_if_we_have_max_caps_and_somebody_buys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
very cool of you!
---
Any and all letters/notes/words written in general I don't even bother reading. Too annoying to read.
---
From the guy who runs to find a solid colored surface to stare at every time he completes a quest, I feel this.
---
me too.
---
That is really good to know. Thanks.
---
I sell them for 25 caps and they get bought out constantly
---
Can it be decorative item in camp?
---
matching disco ball, 800 atoms
---
Can i ask how do you sustain the ammo cost of 1cap each? I finally got to start using my 3k 5.56 ammo stash and they went in no time.
---
I'm always stating at that sky so I can see what my quest rewards are  it's so annoying
---
400K in sales &amp; loving it, had to buy up all the serum recipes to dump cash I have so much.
---
U do realize there is a disco ball decoration
---
I find adhesive literally everywhere, wonderglue, sealed wonderglue, economy wonderglue, duct tape, pack of duct tape, military grade duct tape, I just make it a habit to always pick up while I’m scouring Appalachia, screws just pick up a lot of toys and baby rattles and also battered clipboards
---
Which is why I said it’s time to bust it out..
---
Mirror Ball Plan. No atoms
---
Im gonna have to check this out
---
If you hit R3 i think, to only show the stuff you can craft they might appear. had this happen with the easter eggs. wouldnt show up untill i filtered out everything else for some reason.
---
Is it in the locker, or outside it?  Meaning, can you actually see the hide and choose to pick it up, or is it inside the locker?  Everyone's container loot is different.
---
I’m sorry to say that that isn’t how you spell noir
---
or just ask your friend to lock his camp's terminal for you 12 times. Did that bage in 10 mins
---
It's interesting but .38 seems to be more expensive than 556 but isn't worth even half of it.
---
You can choose to rebuild the Minutemen  as their general and see them prospering. Responders teach you how to boil water.
---
Curses! That's what I get for posting before my morning coffee. Thanks for the comment
---
Could be, I won't deny that. I just figured after 633hrs of play time, I'd have a fair idea on run of the mill disconnects vs something that occurred a little too close to me doing something to be coincidence. Which, for as crappy as my internet is, I experience very few of. For that matter, I experience very few disconnects *in general,* compared to how everyone else makes it seem.
---
Todd and his sweet little lies
---
Keep in mind, the pickaxe skin is a bundle with 3 skins
---
I pre order it for 40 bucks from CDkeys. Honestly even though the first two months were hit or miss ive been having a good time. Logged about 230ish hours in. I don't think you have anything to lose just by giving it another go since you already own it.
---
Psychotats recipe totally exists, looks for it @ the enclave medical bay
---
Yeah I've had to re-buy my All Rise about 3 or 4 times. Most recently got it for 50 caps from a player vendor so that was cool. Shouldn't ever have to do that again. :-)
---
I've been playing an average of about 4 hours every day since the first BETA Thursday and don't have that plan.  It may not exist or be some unicorn like the shielded raider/casual underarmor plan.
---
My camp is Im a popular spot so every time I load in and I can't place my camp I stay in the world And look at the others person camp 
---
I've switched worlds 4 times before I could place my camp And have never had a issue.
---
 It's only when you move your camp it will be placed differently.
---
Yeah, but if you're used to running nukes it's not that hard of an ordeal. 
---
The first area is stealthable, the reactor area is almost stealthable, the mainframe area is much easier with an explosive weapon, storage is made much easier if you've got the cores on-hand or find them easily, and the final gauntlet is cheesable if you jump onto the railing up top to reduce spawns.
---
The only difficult part would be hunting for code pieces and solving the code if you want to avoid relying on Nukacrypt/EnclaveDB.
---
Just make a list of who you are and what you want
---
And make him glow, he glowed when I caught him.
---
I think it should be anyone but we can accept decline things there should be a cost depending on weight and if we decline it returns to sender.
---
Hopefully wastelanders picks up on some role playing by making some responders survive the scorched plague.
---
and even when you do being able to revive them is impossible for me, i spent half an hour with a friend continually dying in water, every time they did there was no option to revive them, if they died out of water i could.  
---
Sucks because that is the last one i needed and they can't play now till next week.
---
"That doesn't work for me brother, cry moar" ?
---
I like this change.
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch is the only thing I hate more than groups of gutsys.  Then mirelurk queens then kings.  Sad I will gladly attack 3 SBs but take great pains to go around a group of gutsys lol
---
Only 2 things have ever been worse than a group of gutsys.
---
The Trio of 78 ** legendary scorched glowing diseased moth men I met while fighting 2 SBs
---
And the pack of 4 scorched glowing Wendigo that had their way with me when I was like level 38.  2 *** legendary  backed by  2 kings... that each summoned 2 scorched mirelurk kings and a pair of mirelurk hunters.  I remember this one vividly cause I still search the Mire for revenge many,many levels later.
---
Hasn’t reset in 24hrs thought it reset after like 4 hrs for caps
---
Yeah I did notice that! I thought I was the only one but I guess not
---
Posted a pic lower on :) the twitter also has it showing with a hat
---
Well even if I stop carry anything at all it wont stop the game from crashing and freezing and a game support of being useless doesnt it?
---
It seems ok for me.  RNG is truly random.  Sometimes it takes a while to get a roll under 30.  If you've ever played Dungeons and Dragons or other tabletop RPG, this is actually pretty common.
---
Yeah. They are 50 atoms each and there is 4 of there. It’s a good start
---
I saw a guy selling 1 forest map for 800 caps. I was like i dont need to look at this inventory anymore.
---
They dont stack, the one that you used last will replace the effect of the one you used first
---
Do we have any confirmation if Super Duper is affected by Luck?  Or if that might have changed?
---
If you are on XB1, I can die for you. Just gotta load up some grenades and toss them far enough away to knock me down to nothing, but not so much that I can’t be revived.
---
I’m RhymingFezzik on Xbox.
---
Isn’t that the same locations as the event though? I think enemies are supposed to spawn there.
---
Doesn't work for me either ☹️
---
So after 10 minutes ( little more ) 5 plants had something on them
---
My farm: [https://i.imgur.com/9e0M03g.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/9e0M03g.jpg)
---
Some plants have bugged animation, they stay showing their fruits but arent harvestable.
---
Light wood laminate.
---
Light wood laminate
---
Good advice. I hadn't thought about Lead Belly. I wish the animation for the Cannibalism perk didn't take so long so that it was easier to use on the run.
---
Instead of editing my post, I'll just add it into a comment (for those of you who may not agree with me), then *it* can get fairly down-voted instead of the bug report.
---
Down-voting of Bug reports doesn't do **anyone** any favors, just so you know. If you disagree, I humbly welcome that, but do so with a comment and an explanation. You don't ahve to up-vote, but seriously, don't down-vote it unless your intent is for the game to *not* be improved. We can ALL agree that the servers crashing is no fun, so I would think we'd rather them at least look into it, instead of having it overlooked. 
---
\*shrug\* That's just my opinion I guess. Tis your own prerogative, in the end...
---
Been like this for weeks for me anyway, very few instances of the Perk firing, not  bothered posting as these types of post always get shot down as being purely in the overreacting mind of the player and 'no proof'. I don't craft much and I really don't care as this point whether they are stealth nerfing elements of the game.
---
I actually did but it just feels really weird at the moment.
---
It started working after 24 hours
---
I did archer, athlete, and swimming.
---
When you get your backpack, scrap it and craft a new one at an armor workbench.
---
I've been looking for wolves for three days...
---
It shouldn't effect it. If it would i would be even more frustrated because i'm running around with 34 luck.
---
Yeah I have an elaborate defence set up. The only problem is a Level 1 Mole Rat took out two Heavy Machine Gun Turrets no problem. Give me the ones from Harpers Ferry to put in my CAMP and then this becomes a non-issue.
---
Hi
---
Is that what that is?! Sometimes when I port to a shop it's just bombarded with armies of ghouls, mutants, scorched, I just figured they were always under attack or something LOL
---
I heard Paleoarchaeologist do it in the dirt!
---
Still doing this ?
---
Yea, dust off your old TSE/ BE weapons, Ass/Sent/Cav set and off you go into the survival.
---
  What's that? You don't have one of those? I've got bad news....
---
I'm not visually impaired but I have double vision and the small text is really hard to read and I refuse to sit right in front of my TV.
---
Sorry can't read have do defend another settlement
---
They are waiting for their big moment, their big server leak and loss of passwords and user data, then it will be damage control like so many companies after the inevitable.
---
I havent got to see one yet. Youre lucky and its lvl 50.
---
Hola!
---
It was on the locker.  Figured I've give y'all a heads up in case it spawns there again.  Also the prison tends to be a super mutant place
---
Cant right now, theres a variety of things...new power armour skins, emotes, hairstyles, backpack skin, free orange carpet
---
I’m gonna add you right now!
---
Cheers bud, i'm done for today and am on PC, but i appreciate it. So if they take too much damage they die outright and can't be revived? that was possibly the problem.
---
That would only be cool if we kept 100 percent of those caps but as someone calculated we get about 60 percent of each sale. I sold 500+ rounds @ 1 cap each and only got around 380 caps for it
---
I rarely post here and i'm not mad or something. Just wanted to know if ppl feel the same and seemingly they do.
---
Same with my blade of bastat
---
Absolutely saved my life. Was on some serious dehydration domination before hand XD
---
Cap vendors reset every ~20 hours. Legendary should have too. It’s been reset every day I’ve played.
---
The light sources on power armor were also 1/3 their current brightness so it made it impossible to see at times. I'd be willing to go back to the darker nights now since we have viable light sources instead of candle light.
---
Agree as well. Package ammo to realistic cou ts as if you bought from a store.
---
-25% VATS cost is underrated. It stacks with automatic weapons bonus for -75% vats cost. My combat rifle costs 7 AP per shot. It costs 10 to jump... It's cheaper to shoot than it is to jump.
---
I'm also a fan of 40% attack speed on melee weapons. I tend to focus on DPS numbers over big number.
---
i also wanted to know this, if it was face/glasses or head, because this would be nice to wear with a hat
---
yeah sorry, it was executioners
---
don't be sorry for thinking logically
---
I think that's the point. Jar is supposed to contain regular frog, but dumb vault dweller just can't see difference, or just don't care
---
I've noticed it procs but the animation doesn't appear. It started to really confuse me when the crafted amount of items ended up being different than the actual amount of items in my bag
---
Is under "Floor Decorations" on build mode.
---
Wait. What?
---
That's bullshit because Prime bonus is only against scorched. You gonna shoot ultracite ammo at regular mobs? Okie dokie
---
perk loadouts
---
text chat
---
larger stash
---
I constantly have to use the magnifier,  on the xbox home screen
---
oh thats good. i can get that every sunday. Please make it a weekly challenge for 40 atoms.
---
Hopefully that’s a static spawn.
---
I literally laughed out loud reading this.  Now everyone at work is looking..... \*slouches at desk\*
---
Thanks for this. There's also a level 3 terminal at Poseidon energy plant next to the fusion core generator. I'm sure there's a few inside too but can't remember their levels.
---
Need server stability first.
---
Ah, thanks, I don’t play very offen, no internet at home so it’s set up at work
---
I suppose this is only subjective, unless someone can actually test the system and make a graph, but then that would need to be compared with the same created before we started noticing this, so can't be done.
---
to add to this, you can do this on Xbox as well by just holding the guide and clicking magnifier
---
I have it at my camp, in be willing to help
---
another couple hundred would be a good start
---
Where is campfire tales at exactly?
---
Im on xbox,like rb button?
---
Let me get a different costume
---
Thank you bunches and bunches from a lone pioneer scout from the wastes
---
But in the store it costs 6 caps per ammo?
---
That's because their is a max limit. Next time you're at your purifier, select transfer instead of take. 
---
Left bottom corner you'll see your max weight, same concept applies for the purifier. Will have something like 3lbs max weight on right side. If each water weights 1lb, means you'll be maxed out at 3 waters even if your purifier can produce 17/hr. You'd need to be around to collect each time it's full in order for it to continue to produce more.
---
Note that was just an example. I don't know the max weight off the top of my head.
---
I think its left stick or right stick
---
16 times the detail!
---
If you need human NPCs to enjoy the story, you've never enjoyed any Fallout story. Most of it comes from the environment, terminals, etc -- just like in every other Fallout game. Plus, there are human NPCs. Ever listened to a holotape recorded by a human? That's a non-player character.
---
try to do it at the south of Solomon's Pond, where the Behemoth spwans.  
---
I did it solo with my alt account. take the radiation damage till you have only like 20-40 hp;
---
hop on the top of the tree and jump into the water area.
---
mothmen are a rare sighting for me and I've only seen two together once in a Nuke Zone.  They usually don't give me much trouble.  The only thing I really watch for is 2 or more yogi's or 2 or more Mirelurk Kings.  If paired up,  yogi's will get to playing handball with you if you can't cripple them up first and the Kings sonic attack can take huge chunks off your health, especially if you can't see the second one.  3 of each and you are usually dead unless your in a strategic area with some cover or something to jump up on.
---
That'll be 1600 atoms
---
Per hole
---
That’s correct. You need to take enough damage to knock you down where you are on your hands and knees. You are able to be saved at that point. If you take too much damage, you just straight up die and can’t be saved.
---
If it was like the 'real' thing your kid won't sleep for weeks :) I applaud Bethesda for making a truly creepy and scary creature, by its looks, sounds and actions, it's also hard to kill with that neat regen going on.
---
You don't need to get so offensive about this dude, also the argument there are human npc's but they're dead is idiotic.
---
They occasionally spawn at the investigator's cabin towards the bottom of the savage divide
---
Very well done!
---
Yeah, I get how that part works. I've tested it out with the industrial purifiers before. They each hold max 5; in theory, 6 in my camp should mean they're all full after half an hour. In practice, it doesn't come close.
---
This is the most reliable thing to do. Equal parts amazing and frustrating, almost all in-game lighting actually affects how well you can see your Pip Boy screen.
---
In some cases, you can toggle between the pip boy and PA ui with V (PC) to address this and other accessibility issues (Chameleon/stealthboy).
---
Camp Adams, bottom left of the forest
---
Yeah I think gender-locking the hairdos is bullshit when there are already so few...let alone gender-locking PURCHASED ones. :/
---
Definitely prefer this to more stash.  I'm still getting blue screened (ps4) in nuke zones
---
Bugged animation works the other way around too. I've had plants show no fruit; yet I'm still able to pick them.
---
I'm on ps4.  Going to hop servers shortly.  Will let you know
---
Ty man
---
so you're saying it pales in comparison?
---
there is no plans for plasma grenade or mines. there are lots of things ingame that dont have a plan for some raisin
---
That is almost exactly what we tried, the river near the behemoth, the pond with the behemoth, radiation, physical damage and fall damage jumping off my sniper-nest tower into the river.  I will try again at some point.
---
Hes. Not. Real.
---
The real question is...
---
...do you collect bones while wearing fedoras??
---
Yeah sometimes I’ll check out a camp’s machines and it’s fusion cores for 300 and 75 for a Stimpak. Such a waste of caps on fast travel.
---
I WANT A FULL-ON TERRARIUM!
---
Oh look at this, we got us a wise guy XD
---
Your comparing a competitive marketing product to an item in a fiction videogame? Sure
---
Are you there the entire time? As they're not instanced and others can grab if not locked.
---
Might also just be another bug. When was last time you tested? I've recently visited other player camps before who have 6+ purifiers as well, all with 5 waters in each.
---
i did scan the game and it said fallout 76 is unable to be certified due to an error accessing a file. 1.14.32.5.12.933 cant find any info on what this even means lol.
---
Yes 5.56 takes one more gunpowder than .38, making it slightly more costly to craft. Keep in mind that this doesn't account for abundance.
---
Don’t forget the beerhat!
---
Lol gf still yells at me for not trying to take a picture of those moth men while I was fighting them and everything else in the zone.  Gotta love that girl.
---
same, except i miss the glorious olden days of finding unwanted legendaries in the ice machine outside whitesprings club house.
---
No idea, but I had the same problem.  Ran into a kind soul right outside the scout testing center who agreed to trade revives.  I stepped a bit into the nearby lake, de-armored and dropped a grenade.  Went off without a hitch, and he revived me in the water with no issue.  
---
When it came his turn, though, he kept having the same problem.  He went through a half dozen plasma grenades, but kept jumping straight to respawn (and displaying a red skull symbol before doing so).  Tried various ranges, and even letting the grenade roll downhill into the water (which I think must have happened with my go).  Also tried rad death, same result.  I finally had to settle for a non-aquatic revive, by having him jump off the scout camp tower (he was radded up enough from the lake that the fall damage was sufficient).  Frustrating that I'm going to have to go back and do all this again to get the swimming badge.
---
I assume that the difference between "revivable" and "respawn" has something to do with how far negative you go in health.  Don't know if that red skull marker just means dead, or if it's an indicator of non-recoverable death.
---
Huh.  Seems like someone could make a few caps this way, or make a fun player event.  Find or setup a high-dive point above a shallow pond (too shallow to stop fall damage or allow sinking below water level on death), take off all your armor, rad up to a minimal health level, and repeatedly jump to your doom on demand.  Bonus points for using various camp traps to simulate a dunk tank!
---
Love that it's free, but have to agree that the texture doesn't look much like actual shag carpet...
---
I used to be infuriated by this and moved my camp. Noticed same thing after a while at my camp and then realized the mobs would sometimes have legendary items and was utterly joyous one of then dropped a 2 shot handmade 😃😃😃
---
I swear its like the gift that keeps giving now that I can deposit the legendaries. That was the only big draw back for having so many junk legendaries.
---
I’m

Overemcumbereddd one sec
---
Free range, and leader of the pack both spawn wolves as well.
---
That’s just bound to happen when you dig though. Purposefully looking for animals and plants is different from studying humans and history through artifacts.
---
My power armor starts with '!' so it is at the top and worn armor starts with 'zzz' so it is at the end of the list.
---
Unfortunately they may never have "server stability"  (we are 6 months in) but they could easily resolve the problem with Main Menu Stash (not in game) as it would have ZERO negative effect on the server stability (because it is in the Main menu)
---
I 100% agree we need more stash space, but it seems they either are unable (technical issues?) or unwilling (??) to give it to us
---
(the below is copied from other posts giving Bethesda alternative suggestions on how to give us more, please copy/paste and send in via the suggestion / help tickets to Bethesda at  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) )
---
**Main Menu Stash**
---
Have a Stash that you can ONLY access from the Main Menu (not in-game), which would have tremendous benefits to the players and Bethesda, such as:
---
* No negative impact on server stability (since it is not in a game lobby), just an interface in the Main menu that would bring up trade window that allows you to exchange items between your characters in-game stash and the out-of-game stash.  All it would be doing is moving items between the main lobby stash save file and the players save game file.
---
* Could be implemented immediately (as there is no issue with server stability) and more easily than slowly increasing the in-game stash size (which you should still continue to do)
---
* You could EASILY charge Atoms to unlock use of this Main Menu Stash ($$$$) as this is not “pay to win” it is just more storage for those who want it (optional).  I can tell you without a doubt, everyone I play with would want this main menu stash and would be willing to pay Atoms for it. My friends and I want this far more than any new skin or clothing item the Atom store has (or is likely to ever have), so this is potentially the LARGEST ATOM REVENUE potential right in front of you, and whoever leads the charge to implement this, will be a HERO to both Bethesda (for satisfying one of the most popular requests from players AND making them more money than ANY other item EVER in the Atom store) and a HERO to many, many players (like me ;)
---
* I cannot stress how much the issue of Stash limit has negatively impacted this game to me and the people I play with.  It is without a doubt one of the most requested changes I am aware of and you can easily fix it.
---
* Screening items:  When items are transferred between the in-game stash and the main menu stash, you could set up an simple filter to look for anything (duplicated weapons / items from the developer room etc) quickly and easily, so this will also help you improve your game security!!!!
---
Would this not be a simple solution for both Bethesda and the players who want more Stash?  (and have ZERO negative effect on those who do NOT want more stash, in fact it will even BENEFIT those players, by allowing other players to move more items out of the in-game stashes, reducing lag etc)
---
**Junk - Weight in Stash**
---
Also, when junk is placed in your Stash, it should then have a zero weight.   While it is on the player it has its normal weight, but as soon as it hits the Stash, its weight should be reduced to zero.
---
* This will significantly increase the amount of storage players have in their Stashes (in-game) without having to worry about server stability, as all Junk items stack and as such it would not matter if there were 10 or 1,000 of the same Junk item.
---
* This could provide much more potential Stash space than adding 200 weight increases to its capacity
---
I'm getting far less than I was. 
---
But we were promised 1000# stash space but that wont happen until we have better stability.
---
Far N.E on map. Location named Gnarled Shallows. Close to Abbie's Bunker head due East
---
Thank you! No rush as I don’t even have a machine haha. If you could imgur it and message me?
---
Man I skip clipboards all the time I thought they just gave wood scraps. Well shit.
---
Coming!
---
Haha yes it’s pretty creepy! Good thing the plush is cute. If I could I’d make it big enough and put metal wiring in it to make it sturdy. And hopefully be like a seat
---
My beard disappears when i put on the mask :(
---
From 30 years old i magically turn into a 20 boi with a skull mask
---
Message me and we can discuss details
---
I mostly use concrete steps. The wooden ones are poorly designed for land with any elevation to it.
---
Lol I'm gunna use that in future, got a good ring to it
---
Yup
---
Place a spotlight.  Seems to be able to provide the turrets with a target more quickly and at further ranges.
---
&gt;The best cosmetic content in the game is only obtainable by paying additional money.
---
Isn't that 100% subjective lmao? I got the sheepsquatch mascot costume from the event *for free* and haven't used anything but that ever since it came out. It's the best outfit in the game for me.
---
&gt;However the people who have a negative opinion of Bethesda FAR outweigh the ones who actually play the game. 
---
People's outrage over this game means almost nothing for Bethesda in the long run. If gamers being angry on reddit/youtube actually had any impact then EA would've gone out of business years ago.
---
Elder Scrolls VI is going to sell no matter what.
---
It still procs for me, but I'm pretty sure they toned down the audio considerably.
---
I liked the more narrowed light for the same reason. The tension of not being able to see made everything more tense.
---
Yeah, this was the one I was going to mention too: Specifically I believe the roof access is level 3?
---
I make a tiered array of heavy MG turrets. Straight stairs from a foundation block pointing in the direction of the enemy spawn point. Connect a half floor(steel grating one, not wood) to the top of that, perpendicular. Extend that in both directions by one so you have a sort of scaffolding like structure. Then another stair in the same direction, and repeat. Three turrets on each level, facing out. Then at the base foundation, I extend it both directions so they become a barrier on that entire side of the camp. Place walls on the outward sides and at the ends. Static spawn enemies will either attack the walls or try to run all the way around and up the stairs trying to get the turrets, and the whole time they are getting mowed down. That leaves 4 turrets which I place on the opposite side of my camp, either on the roof of my actual house or on pre existing structures facing in, which mow down the random spawns which attack resources.
---
I noticed that too but the chance still seems lower than 30% now.
---
sure but we would need to change the games name from "inventory management simulator 5000" to something like "kinda like a fallout game 2020"
---
Harper’s Ferry I think.
---
Absolutely Nothing
---
Loosing a junk is only a consequence not the problem it self, and the problem of freezing when item consuming is lasting from a game start! And now it's added up with totally random freezes. And implementing a damn simple option to rejoin a server you were in is an easy task even if they cant fix damn freezes.
---
You can also do exams at Camp Adams I believe. During the day it's usually just few dogs, and no one really goes there.  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Camp\_Adams](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Camp_Adams)
---
i hear that undiscovered location southwest of the pumpkin patch is a roaring good time!
---
I went there already
---
What goggles are those? Don't look like welding ones?
---
This can definitely be a pain.. I recommend changing the view with select, usually helps me
---
That's not good.
---
That's the thing! It really kill off any intention to play the game. Basically saving players progress no matter what is a top priority to any decent mmo but Bethesda for some reason dont think so.
---
This is the single greatest example of an arm chair developer I have ever seen. So many assumptions on quick and flawless fixes that Bethesda SHOULD do that would be EASY and FIX everything.
---
Phrasing!
---
Oh I 100% agree with you I craft food constantly and my normal runs yield so much less then they used to.
---
Link me man
---
Ahh, good old fashioned living room digestive noises!
---
In what way do you notice bad camp performance? Lag or something?
---
i dont think mothman has any repeatable spawn locations. just wander the wastlands.
---
This seems to work, I can now access it. Weird as hell though
---
ah ok, that makes more sense :P
---
I'm nowhere near water, so I definitely don't have that prolem. The rats are the worst because they never trigger my turrets.
---
Been doing that lol, super hard to find.
---
Free States vendor in White Springs has it
---
Now it can be useful :) thx mate
---
I feel like this would work especially well in Survival Mode.
---
It's improved drastically since launch.
---
There's also one on the top floor of the observatory.
---
Maybe under defenses... never seems to be where you expect.
---
My issue is launching a nuke. Level 88. Still haven't gotten around to it.
---
it definitely is. i think i have a couple wings stashed. u on xbox?
---
There was two - but we dont know when they are coming - just "soon"
---
For me he spawns the most in the mountainsides of the savage divide. Areas with lots of rocky cliffs, he'll usually spawn facing outwards looking over the cliff.
---
Maybe another tnt dome was unlocked or it’s a port over from fo4 if your on pc
---
I’m excited. Thank you
---
survival needs a reset..
---
closed system.. if you join adventure.. you cant go back...
---
Ill checkb
---
Maybe I’d actually play it in that case. Or maybe not, I’m kind of tired of dying in one shot to sweaty no-lifers so I stopped playing it until some sort of balance system is implemented
---
I haven’t. But now I’ve seen it. I want it.
---
Major FPS drops. My PC consistently drops from over 100 FPS down to the 30s and 40s around camps.
---
I only recently got super duper 2, seems to work more than I would have guessed but thats RNG for you.
---
No problem at all - here is the thread where it was revealed https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine/
---
Something from developers room?
---
Exactly. I'm crafting a lot of food and ammo on a daily basis and it really feels "less". Especially when you back up from the bench or cooking station every time you hear it goes off.
---
I have seen him 3 diff times now, north of the church thats in the Mire.
---
This is literally the definition of pay to win.
---
Supposedly coming - see  [https://imgur.com/a/EBOwUCk](https://imgur.com/a/EBOwUCk)  and  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch\_05\_new\_atomshop\_datamine/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine/)
---
you guys over there are probably loving all the recent daily/weekly challenges huh?
---
I read that he spawn during the "path to enlightenment" event but I'm not sure if you can kill him for wings.
---
Watoga shopping center and watoga Station also carry it.
---
I used the prosnap camera and it said fossils on the top right and it still didn't check off.
---
We should be able to put them at some common place, like a Player Vending Mall for all players (like inside Whitesprings Hotel) so they are easy to get to and all the Vending machines are at one place.
---
My guess is it going to be limited to certain things - and then via certain "display units"
---
So long as I can display my collection of magazines, bobbleheads, and even drinks above my bar I will be a happy vault survivor
---
same here, already asked for a refund or a fix.
---
As an update to this because I’m bored: I tried farming this way and it didn’t work for like 10 attempts, then I returned to my base to prep for another run when I found mothman chilling on a cliff next to me near vault 76. Happy coincidence
---
And now every Sheepsquatch is Big Smoke hahaha
---
Oh! And thank u Bethesda for closing my ports on my router since last Friday update they close and I don't have access to the ISP to call and open them up just when the new stuff is coming out this happens and I been there since launch date shm #whyme
---
Yeah. I had to reinstall last week. I'm on the PS4 as well. I downloaded the update and was playing fine, then the next day I got crashes trying to load into the game. I attributed it to trying to start the game while having internet issues. Is that similar to your scenario?
---
100% not true
---
But please explain why you think so?
---
And even if you do think so, Bethesda can make it FREE for everyone (solved)
---
Proof that it is NOT pay to win:
---
Right now you can go create 5 characters on each account (800 X 5 = 4,000 per account)
---
You can also make unlimited accounts on PS4 and XB1 so you can have as many Mule accounts as you want  (it is inconvenient)
---
Scorch Beast Queen has around 3200 HP fixed and it does not scale with number of players around her
---
Honestly, depends on what kind of archaeology you do and where you do it. Archaeologists now in the US work together with native peoples of the areas when they find human remains. Sometimes, like in the case of my previous class, the indigenous populations ask for the digs to stop and they have the final say. 
---
Of course it might not be true everywhere but that’s what happened in my previous class. 
---
We also left artifacts where they were and catalogued them. So if we found a grinding stone, for example, we would record it and leave it where we found it.
---
Chem bench is super duper common...I’ve probably found that plan 10 times.
---
What makes human NPCs good? I'm not talking about characters with a story or unique dialog I mean the shitty NPCs that spout the same line over and over lol
---
It's a benifit obtained by only paying money. You can misinterpret all p2w features as "convenience" items.
---
Not sure if you have tried it yet or not but you can change the normal pip boy view to a different view.  Hope it helps you.
---
Hard to have personality if you're dead... Unlike the minutemen 😏😂
---
Serious note however, I think each leant itself to their personality role. Minutemen were actively at war to better people's lives and responders were there as healers in a way tending to the physical and emotional needs. There's also more characters with back stories and depth in the responders. 
---
So I agree yes. But that doesn't mean better/worse for either.
---
Maybe. Either way, I feel like it’s not too much to ask to not be nibbled on while I’m taking an exam.
---
I just had to get rid of my turrets. I only have the starting turrets still (I dunno where you even get other plans). 
---
They would just shoot endlessly and the Mirelurks would never die unless I handled them myself.
---
is it free in the atom shop rn?
---
Last mentioned here  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor) 
---
&gt; Patch 9.5 will not include C.A.M.P. display cases. We are still working to ensure this feature will provide the best experience possible once we bring it to the game with a future update. Thank you again for your patience, we will be sure to share more details about display cases as we get closer to releasing them
---
Thanks for your business 👌
---
I’ve had people tell me that the luck attribute plays no role in legendary drops but I don’t really believe that to be the case. Can anyone else weigh in on this issue?
---
You should be able to recraft one, right? Once you get the weapon you get the plan for it. I haven't tried to remake my voice of set since I sold mine though so I'm not 100% on that
---
Disgustingly common 🤦‍♂️ Seeing it in Vending Machines for a 100 caps make me cry sometimes.
---
It got fixed for me i can play again with my main
---
My man! Thanks. I better remove this before they buff her health heh.
---
heeeeell yea, boutta shag my CAMP up
---
Yeah the normal view is better. It still is see through to the point of unreadable often.
---
&gt;I have received serum recipes personally from the Queen event (Scorched Earth). I have also bought some from the enclave.
---
You're saying they aren't characters not controlled by the player? You should probably learn what certain words mean -- like "character" and "non-player." Are you saying they aren't human because they died?
---
I doubt it - I think it will be more along the lines of the player vendor system, punch bowl, still, fermentor, etc.
---
You assign something from your stash, it stays in the stash (counts against the weight limit) but is tagged to the display item
---
At least that is what I think they will do
---
No main quest? You've not look very hard if you think that.
---
Edit: and yes the game is great fun. Was a lot of trouble at the start because it was so buggy. Plus I don't think reviewers were allowed near it until release and they were all so shitty about it that it swayed a certain degree of bad press.
---
Will stay with him for an hour. I'm at whitesprings
---
That's Wise Mothman, he's gentle and cannot be killed. Though he's super cute.
---
👍🤘
---
Sadly no, but thank you for the offer.
---
sure that works for me :)
---
You should be able to get the other turrets just by getting home defense to level 3
---
You got 6 days. No need for a speeding ticket.
---
Couldn't disagree more with the way you're suggesting to implement this, you say it's not pay to win but if they charge atoms its no different to paying atoms for an extra storage perk I game, just with an added screen to navigate through.
---
Also it would encourage the dupers and real world traders to stock up on more items to do trades against the rules.
---
Finally, making junk weightless in the stash boxes? Surely making items weightless defeats the point of a limit, and doesn't help at all with the issue of server stability.
---
I agree stash sizes need to be increased, but it needs to be done in the right way and for everyone equally, I think the way they're doing it at the moment is OK, just need to pick up the pace and increase it at a faster rate whilst still monitoring server stability.
---
Funny story. I was AFK up north doing some editing work and glanced at the TV. Saw glowing red eyes. Rushed over and killed the mothman. Third one I have seen in the wild.
---
No. You need the original sword you took from the display case in whitespring. Either that or find one at a vendor somebody sold. Then you can craft it, and level it up with you to level 50.
---
XB1.
---
It's always the Glowing Molerats for me.  At least those drop Nuclear Waste and some fresh meat for me to cook
---
unfortunately that sounds like a bug as it seems to work for other users as described :(  Perhaps try another location, there's a fossil in hopewell cave to the north of wendigo cave and south of the pumpkin house. 
---
Give that one a go maybe?
---
I have taken several workshops and not been attacked recently. Last time i was attacked was before the recent change to limit pvp to the area of the workshop. 
---
Before that it was a fairly regular occurence where a pair of players would team up with one of them going to my workshop while the other one would find me elsewhere. I would get shot with an explosive shotgun that tore up my armor and killed me in one shot, then a second later the notice would pop up that someone was contesting my workshop.
---
But since they put an end to that strategy, I haven't been attacked.
---
On the condition bar there is a white stripe. So the condition is white strip over the yellow. The white is 100%-200% condition then once depleted the yellow (100%-0%) decreases
---
Xbox1
---
Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
---
I prefer power armor mods over plans. 
---
Some armor plans sell pretty well; marine / combar armor plans (also variants like pocketed). Unique interior plans (event related) etc
---
its a great game for current price of 15-20 euro ( or less if you get some of those deals we hear ). Still feels unfinished after months of updates
---
Oh, good. Well I guess I'll never have a voice of set or blade of bastet again. Oh well
---
damn, Ok thanks.
---
Is it not the vault overseer? Her siloute is the same from an earlier quest and officially the overseers mission is not complete
---
It is level locked, need to be 15 and above.

Again, unless you see it at a vendor OR you can buy it from one of these fine folks on reddit who are willing to part with theirs. :)

That would be annoying, I was alone the entire time I was taking it. My only problem was remembering to drink water

I wasn't too attached to them. I fight a lot of robots so voice of set was kinda handy but 44 is hard to find so I rarely used it otherwise.

That would be a terrible idea. Every vendor would be trying to undercut each other.

Don't, server just kicked me. Sorry 😔😢

In the lake where you have to do the swimming challenge, there are radroaches. Sit in the water until your health gets down to 20 or so. Take a radaway so the radiation doesnt kill you. Let the level 1 roaches beat on you until you can be revived.
---
If you are "swimming" you cannot be revived. Just be in the water deep enough that you are taking radiation damage.
---
Easy Peasy.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Has anyone looked into whether the luck attribute affects legendary item drop quality and/or quantity of enemies.
---
I don’t miss mine now. But when I accidentally scrapped my blade a while back, you better believe I was annoyed.

Agreed, waiting on Bethesda to explain all that

---
And the canopy Zipline course would be a lot easier too
---
Wow super helpful, thank you!
---
&gt; People's outrage over this game means almost nothing for Bethesda in the long run.
---
Yup. Same with stuff like Skyrim and Fallout 4. People online can post hit pieces, or make hour long videos about how horrible the games are, but both are still critically acclaimed and massive undeniable successes that brought the game series into the international community. Starfield will almost certainly be the same, TES 6 even more so and Fallout 5 even more then that.
---
All the other buildings in the world they totally ignore, but they really don't like my water pump.

Already have my mirror ball. Good times.
---
Ok, so make it FREE (solved)  as to the rest of your comments, they are 100% inaccurate
---
Dupers would HATE my idea as moving things to the MAIN MENU STASH would allow them to be screened for Duplicated items etc (so it would make the game MORE SECURE)
---
Items that STACK in game do not effect the server any differently if there are 1 or 1,000 (as I stated in OP) so you are wrong.    So JUNK items (whether weightless or not) do not lag the server if there are 1 or 1,000 (as they STACK)
---
Please read the OP

There is a main quest, it's just not as interactive as other games have been.  You don't really have a 'choice' or side to take in it, it all leads the same place and ends the same for everyone.
---
So when your In the trade menu you just give it to the other guy and it glitches and makes u learn it without using the plan
---
sorry what's the metal helmet? i've only seen the soldier and combat helm
---
Yeah, mine ticked off
---
You can’t be moving when you line up the photo
---
Also, run up and kill that rabbit, then photo it’s cold dead corpse. Still counts
---
And another challenge in Possum needs 10 dead rabbits
---
I did and the challenges are stupid I'm sure everyone think the same
---
Isn't it 32,000?
---
I appreciate your input! Thankfully Armor mods will also be a part of my shop 😁 Plans have just been harder to 'group' into what sells.
---
I've heard it matters where your C.A.M.P. builder is placed but I wouldn't swear to it.
---
Thats how capitalism works. Have I spotted a communist?!?!?
---
32767 in the files, but that's not necessarily how it works in practice. I suspect that the SBQ does scale in patch 9. I've beaten it with three players and it took far less ammo than when I've killed it with 10.
---
What the hell man I only just bought the Mothman Billboards at full price!
---
And y’all need a patch soon the Pioneer Scouts messed up building with a bunch of new bugs.
---
\#1  If the Main Menu Stash was FREE your perceived issue is SOLVED (so please read this and tell me if FREE = PAY to win?)
---
\#2  You do not have to PAY money for Atoms (I have Never paid and have 5,000 of them) as they can easily be obtained in game
---
\#3  This is NOT pay to win, as more storage is NOT a pay to win mechanism (you perhaps do not understand what "pay to win" means)
---
\#4  Convenience items are NOT Pay to Win, think about it, how does more storage help you "Win"?
---
Is it going to take up camp budget?  If so, I'm screwed, I'm almost at the max.  NEED MORE BUDGET.
---
Forest-20  
---
divide, heap, mire, bog-40  
---
Toxic valley- 50  
---
The toxic valley has high end loot chances hence the higher prices
---
Correct, lol
---
Get Sunkissed instead and collect waters in the day time :p
---
Definitely a double edge sword
---
Yeah, I tried that but people just kept spawning in the same spot
---
Yeah missed a 0
---
Oh, I’ve never though of that one!! I will be looking into that.
---
I'm usually the victim
---
I dont get it. I have one of those from the insult robot but I dont get the joke about price.
---
Not being a smartass about it
---
Definitely recommended for the protection 👍
---
I got it from uranium fever
---
Why do you need to call the ISP? The IP is only one of a few commonly used ones?:
---
* 10.0.0.1
---
* 192.168.0.1
---
* 10.0.0.100
---
* 192.168.0.100
---
Check those. Login is typically admin / no password or admin / password
---
The spawn point seems to be based on where your CAMP unit was when you originally built—which would be in the dead center of your build circle.
---
Didn't know we were playing government in the game lol
---
Update:. Gave it 24 hours, tried again and it progressed to Step 5: Quality Control and on...
---
Ouch. Good to know.
---
Well, duh.
---
Good luck with that little fella...
---
Win != Win in PvP.
---
If it's free there's no "pay" so no "pay" to win.
---
Launching nukes without having to clear a silo will be a "convinience". Getting scrips without grinding would be a "convenience". No PvP win in these but get my point?
---
I guess they could have it either way, where you can only use the Main Menu Stash to move things on 1 account, or on multiple accounts, but it would give us WAY more stash space without ANY server issues (which is desperately needed)
---
It doesn't scale. But it has a damage mitigation perk.
---
well the best deal is still 1 cap per bullet, maybe cheaper if you buy materials, but i cannot imagine spending 3k on ammo, use it all in few hours and making any profit. What do you farm ?
---
Yeah I noticed the other day a mole rat was owning my purifier and not one of my like 7 turrets within range started firing. I had to take it out myself.
---
They took out camp damage in the last patch mate. All you will do is blow yourself up and leave a bag of junk in their foundations.
---
I know it's frustrating, but you'd only be hurting yourself.
---
What makes you think it is the fault of the camp owner? They have no control over that ...
---
Do use ammosmith (and super duper).  It doesn't make the challenge easier, but you get free film.
---
Ok you dataminers. You know what we can get. Now we need instructions on HOW to get it.  👍😆
---
OR. make it so the only time heavy landing triggers is if you have explosive vents on your legs.. AND actually fix them
---
I think the engine is so patched they'll create dupe glitches no matter what.  I have stuff randomly dissapear or get duped somehow (never guns mainly power armor parts) regularly.  We can't ban people when that happens!
---
Fingerprint every \*\* &amp; \*\*\* legendary weapon and piece of armor.  Have a scanner to run through the server every night or every patch period looking for matches on the fingerprints.  If one happens, delete every instance and notify the owners that they had a duped weapon that was deleted.  If they find MORE THAN TWO of the same fingerprinted legendary everything is deleted - permannet insta-ban.  This would protect a glitch dupe from banning anyone (having 2 of the same thing) but catch the dupers (who usually make more than one dupe at a time).
---
Have receipts generated for \*\* &amp; \*\*\* player to player transactions.  It says who, what, when, where and how much. The system checks dupe lists before allowing the transaction and generating a Receipt. Receipts weigh nothing and are organized on a 'Receipts' tab in your stash. If you got ripped on a dupe, BSG can give you your caps back when you present the sales receipt for that weapon that was deleted as a dupe.... proving you bought on good faith with dupe check.
---
Legendary and player vending machines should scan every weapon being redeemed or put up for sale.  If it finds a dupe, it gets deleted and owner notified dupe weapons was identified and deleted.
---
Without legendary fingerprints there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY you can prove that the item didn't drop naturally.  Not 100% and that's all you need for people to feign ignorance or innocence.
---
So if this feature was FREE, you support it?
---
I’ve only been seeing it since the pioneer scout stuff came out.
---
Absolutely. There are technical difficulties to make it work the way you want it to but I'll be happy if they figure out a way.
---
Haha that would be epic, though splicing voice lines together from movies would be hard, unless we get an epic impersonator to do the lines. I think Mr. Walken might be hard to get a hold of =P.
---
I love the way protectrons say "Responders." Cracks me up every time.
---
meh, I'd rather the default be the high jump
---
Yes! It’s so annoying when I need to go pick blackberries so that I can repair my walls and turrets...
---
They do, most people just don't know it. When you move your camp module, it changes the spawn points in your camp. However, the spawn is different for owners and visitors
---
lol you’re welcome to try
---
Thank you for your sacrifice.
---
i did athlete, archer and cooking, but only because i'm a melee-cook build who uses a rolling pin and has almost every recipe learned (including the s'mores)  so it was easier then the hunting one for me.
---
Angwy widdle waider
---
Do we have any evidence that *you* are real?
---
Damn if only he had done it
---
me and my friend climbed the charleston herald building, jump right into the little shallow water and itll down you.
---
These are the real factions - Abraxo vs. Sugarbombs vs. Vim vs. Nuka-Cola
---
Ah yes r.ip. random trouble shooter rolling pin with 50% limb damage.
---
I like having item condition, but yeah I agree with npc’s destroying your base. Cranberry Bog sucks for camps
---
Sometimes it's a pain to get in places. Like train stations. You jump and your knees clip the roof then you can fall into the ledge below. Pretty akward
---
This should be easier for Bethesda to implement vs. adding new in-game stash.  All the game programmers I know have said it would be quite simple to add (perhaps harder for Bethesda ;)
---
I had orange shag carpet in my room when I was a little kid. It looked like the floor was on fire. One time I actually did set my carpet on fire. I was five.
---
I think it’s just the spawn for people who FT to your vendor icon. You, teammates, people who travel to your player icon will land differently. At least from what I’m seeing. Shoppers are spawning in the dead center—which for me is fine because it’s empty.
---
&gt; The point of the Minuet Men
---
Was to *dance*!
---
To be fair all the bones I picked up were human
---
I will be on around 10pm est
---
True, but those jumps are pretty rare compared to all other jumps.
---
Codebreaker, Archer, athlete for me. I have 2 toons I'm doing this on. Server hop and the terminals reset. Save yourself some caps.
---
Well for me, I use the handmade as a secondary so I wouldn’t have to worry about that much ammo. Also, I farm the supermutants at west tek. Take their caps and weapons then sell. Not that much farming tbh but I have little to no free time.
---
i feel like this would put people without it at a disadvantage on pvp servers.
---
even if its just a tiny one (not that i ever hang on those servers, fuck that.)
---
The main stash itself is saved on server so you can't access it without probing the server anyway. Also, sonce client side data can be manipulated, putting anything into the stash from the client will lead to massive duping issues. And it'll be an un fixable form of duping.
---
Or travel mats.
---
There would be an overseer overseeing the vault
---
Any more photos of the armor pieces or only the helmet?
---
science outfit in atom shop maybe?
---
Lion and Tinman made up most of the budget. You did what you could for Scarecrow.
---
Dang that’s what I was afraid of.  Thanks for the link though.
---
I will definitely be taking heaps more photos :D
---
Well, they have more depth than *you*.
---
Practice more.
---
White springs does
---
Ok so basically it'll be like the bookshelves from skyrim, you can display items in cases, but not place them anywhere. Not what I was expecting, but I'm not exactly disappointed either. Still a little bit of a let down though.
---
Sadly don't think so. 
---
They only seem to spawn at Winding Path &amp; Pioneer Scouts as well. Royal pain.
---
I got one from a player vendor, and I sold the two I had under 100% cond. when I finished the challenge.
---
Are you supposed to be able to loot the wendigo at the end? Cuz when I just did it last night camp counselor Nia disappeared after we killed her and I wasn't sure what to do
---
See? This is what I mean by thought police; I'm guessing in your opinion, presumably what you thought to to be a "good" idea of mine resonated with you enough to question why it was being downvoted; it was only after you found my other thoughts disagreeable that you concluded suppressing my "good" thought was justifiable. 
---
Its backwards logic, and a recipe for suppressing open and intelligent discussion on topics completely unrelated to the topics upon which we disagree. That is, you sacrifice our mutual celebration of a game because you discover I happen to think killing babies is morally wrong; what a shame! 
---
The cruelest irony is, you probably would characterize me as "closed minded".
---
Take care, friend; I'll pray for you.
---
Yeah, they mainly appear when I spawn in my camp so I can deal with them. But due to vending now other people on the server drop by. Had to install missile turrets to increase lethality
---
I see him a lot in the savage divide. Head south from twin lakes and stay high on the cliffs, he'll show up eventually.
---
I get a weird glitch with the Dogwood trees - we renamed them 'Void Trees' because they allow you to peek into the endless void - but not blue trees.
---
Actually, it's virtually impossible for them to not work at the same time since each piece has a 25% chance of not working. 0.25^10 = 0.00000095367431640625 (5 cavialer's/sentinel's + 5 assassin's)
---
I’m on Xbox, I’m assuming you can only to that on pc?
---
Yeh, getting the welcome mats working properly like in fallout 4 would be brilliant.
---
It’s always the same for me. Some dumb thing that I could really give a shit about ties up alllll of my other repairs. That is a mind boggling stupid way for that feature to function.
---
Because the price is so high it’s insulting
---
Correct it is different place for owner and visitors. My camp module is nowhere near where visitors spawn, and they end up stuck in a door. It looks like it may be where the camp module first was placed but not sure. What I have now done is build a porch so visitors spawn on the outside not stuck in door.
---
If this is right, why do my visitors spawn well away from my module?
---
What i do to stop it is as soon as I am about to land take about my pip boy and it cancels out the heavy landing
---
I shagged her rotten baby yeah!
---
The save game files are on a server, the main menu stash would be on a server, both can only be altered via the interface.    They would be able to filter every item and check for duplicates, the Main Menu Stash would eliminate duping, not allow it.
---
70% damage reduction in the files, yes. The numbers just don't work though. I deal &gt;600 damage per shot with my bloodied combat shotgun, or 180 after the damage reduction. The queen has 180 DR after the perforating magazine, so I should be dealing 116 real damage per shot, and it'd take me 282 shells to kill the queen solo if I never hit the head. 
---
In reality, I regularly put 200+ shells into the queen's head. Unless everyone else is literally doing nothing, then 32767 hp doesn't work.
---
I will leave a bag of salt on your corpse which is all the will result from your temper tantrum.
---
It's been at my fiance's camp *twice*! And he's moved, so two different locations. The first time it glitched on his system and stayed upright so we have a cool picture of us posing next to it. The second time we were walking up the stairs at his house and saw one was stuck under the stairs. Apparently they just like him. (We found one doing the cryptid challenge the first time we did it and that one glitched for him too. So many pictures of us with it, none of them on my account. \*sigh\*)
---
i used to have a locked door (i run a saloon with vendor now build in it.. but people spawned in the back.)
---
so instead i made it into a code-door with a one-way pressure plate so people can get out but need the code to get back into the back
---
You can move your camp all you want but it wont change the visitor spawn. That spawn is ALWAYS at the exact center of your camp and ALWAYS on the ground. Moving the camp device only alters your personal spawn point.
---
I do too. A half damaged level 15 lol
---
Then how does that reduce load on server?
---
Even better
---
Practice at what? Jumping from like 30 feet out to get up a 2ft ledge? I've had marsupial for over 100 levels now. Still annoying at times.
---
Last one I got was the glow bug after that .. there known plans and a sell them
---
If I scrap him can I cook up his frog legs?
---
The word would fill up within a day
---
Because there is damage mitigation from distance.
---
Fire fly is and it glows
---
Only if they revoke the camp damage and I can nuke it to make space for my camp.
---
I have tons of grenades and hundreds of stimpacks. I don’t drop paper bags.
---
Pics or ban
---
You are in the Main Menu when you are moving items (so NOT in the game) so you are not in-game at all when transferring items in / out of the Main Menu Stash.     So a player is not even in a game (no load at all)
---
Since this last patch it seems legendary corpses vanish almost immediately upon death sometimes. Really hope they fix this.
---
The robots at Whitespring don't shoot unless provoked. So wouldn't Whitespring have been a good place to hide from the Scorched? I dislike the no  human NPC thing really puts a damper on the game.
---
Me: (Sees Warhawk) \*PTERODACTYL NOISE\* FINALLY!!!
---
maybe just setup camp at the dog cliff would be easier. Provided I dont come along and shoot the mutt, which I always do.
---
That is an excellent idea!
---
Breath more personality into the games world for sure.
---
Looks like dookie tho.  Free dookie.
---
You can kinda do that already. If you're stuck just fast travel again to that same spot. It will usually pop you in a new spot. Another method would be to see if you can drop your PA and enter it.
---
That could be what I've noticed, I'll have to take careful note of the numbers, but I'm so lazy :(
---
Me, too. I've been hoping for guild vaults for a while now.
---
It has gotten much worse since the last update. I have stopped picking locks because of it. Just during lockpicking for me.
---
But it looks cool and that’s what really matters in science
---
But you are still accessing the server. True, the load may be less but still may not be viable. Also, adding separate servers for the main menu stash woukd increase load on servers. Servers nowadays are not separate physical machines. They are instanced, so ipening new servers for something else will increase load on the server machines themselves.
---
You could sell them on Etsy but for CopyRight
---
What color is the canteen on the left side? In the thumbnail it looks green, but the in game ss looks whitish?
---
It was a dumpster fire at launch.  Bug filled, constant crashes, tons of problems.  A lot of the criticism was deserved, and Bethesda hasn't gotten any credit for turning the ship around.
---
The pets of humans are also studied.
---
REad the idea, would be limited in amount approved and if the owner isn't on consistantly would be removed.
---
Got Codebreaker, Archer, Athlete, and Swimmer done so far those were easy. Nuke silos key for different leveled terminals EXCEPT level 0s. Had to server hop the Vault Tec Agricultural center for that one
---
I personally think that the cavialer's and sentinel's effects should have been nerfed to reduce damage by 8% or 7% rather than adding a chance because the 8% or 7% damage reduction keeps you from being invincible by wearing a full set of assassin's and cavialer's/sentinel's armor. A full set would reduce damage by 80% or 75% rather than 115%.
---
Reducing damage by 75% is more consistent than having a 5.6% chance to reduce damage by 115%.
---
I heavily discounted my 3 star gear, 8 mules and 2 mains are just about are max on caps. Nobody can beat my prices....prices based on perks and nothing is over 2K on all 3*s.
---
Fix it Todd xoxo
---
You must be A survival player.... yeah if so this idea shouldn't apply to that version of the game.   
---
To easy to abuse there.
---
100% agree, the landing pause is absurd and unnecessary
---
What? Every online game with an economy has made their own currency. Look at diablo 2 they used high runes or sojs, or 3/20/20 charms instead of using the in-game gold. Path of exile is the same way, in game gold has no real value and trade is done with other items.
---
I don't know what you even mean about shadow currency, it wasn't shadowy at all. It was literally just how economies work on online games.
---
As for them being rare, that is literally the point of currency, caps are a joke easy to get. Uktrawide ammo isn't.
---
Are these game programmers also your uncle who works at Nintendo?
---
I am also having trouble with the photos.  Some of the animal photos not registering as well as the photos at the water park.  I've taken about a dozen that don't register
---
I’m pretty sure it was all stored on an external hard drive, could it be possible they’d be found somewhere on that?
---
I got credit for the syringer yua guai kill by lowering its health to almost dead and finishing it off with the syringer.  The one at Philipi cemetery in the east end of the toxic valley is usually low enough level to kill while tanking the damage.
---
Yes, custom as in they create paint jobs for the cars with whatever they feel like making down to pixel by pixel to create the popular liveries.
---
Someone's missed a core message of the game series
---
It was more a joke pointed at the fact that the world would fill up with buildings I don't give a shit about other than that they are preventing me from placing my camp.
---
Arktos Pharma?
---
Where is the hashtag key in relation to the pound sign?
---
Plans spawn randomly yes. There’s big chance of getting workshop plans for defending the workshops that can be claimed around the world. (The little round logo with tools on it)
---
Some plans are locked to specific vendors. Might wanna check that out if you want specific items. 
---
But my advice would be to make your way to whitespring shopping mall. 
---
The selling prices is based on your charisma in SPECIAL. This affects the prices when selling and buying from vendors. 
---
Ore is melted at the chemistry station for acid cost. 
---
Your camp will get attacked no matter what. So you have to defend it. 
---
If enemies spawn every time you spawn as well, maybe you have placed your camp on a enemy spawn. For some reason the spawns still there with the camp. 
---
Yes you can lock doors. Idk the keys for pc. But check the buttons listed in bottom of the screen when highlighting the door 
---
We have had a lot of trouble with players spawning in sad location with the new vendors. 
---
I think for now they spawn in the middle of the camp. Correct me if I’m wrong
---
Hope that helps!
---
And welcome!
---
Good travels dweller
---
I mean, fallout is very much filled with real world politics. Not related to Bernie though.
---
What does rage have in common with fallout? Isn’t it just a FPS like doom or wolfenstein?
---
The issues when you are in-game is there are 24 players, when you are in the main menu, there is 1 (well technically 0).  Plus all the server has to do is query a simple database file, so no graphics, no sounds effects, no other players, no monsters etc (the load would be incredibly small, virtually negligible).
---
You definitely don't have to keep weapon artisan on all the time, only when you craft. 
---
Use those 3 points for something else.
---
Plans are out there but recipes are more numerous. Ore is smelted at a workbench into usable material. Price from vendors is based on charisma, use hard bargain perk and grape mentats. Enemies hate camps.
---
Mad max lives in fallout 76
---
Apparently this is a veiled suggestion to rename this badge to "Snarchaeologist"! (drum snare)
---
We had it in the living room. Made "the floor is lava" really fun. :D
---
I found Rage to be more like Borderlands than Fallout 🤷‍♂️
---
Im having the same problem over a dozen and nothing.
---
I’ve only heard they’re releasing display cases.... while I would love to place junk down I really have no idea when that’s coming.
---
It has RPG elements. But it doesn’t need anything in common with fallout. Just the quality alone is good for a 360 game. And It made me realise that Fallout 4 and 76 Could and should have been way better.
---
If this is on xbox, I noticed that sometimes you just have to reopen the map and try to fast travel again
---
thank you this helps. also do you think the sneak perk that makes me harder to be detected could be swapped out for marathoner?
---
PArt of the idea is a limiter, only 2 or 3 added per month. With them being removed if the player hasn't played in a month.
---
But don’t bet me wrong, I still love fallout 4 and 76.
---
very irritating, at least I'm not alone.
---
True champ!
---
Like 4-5k each
---
Only thing I'd add is the vendor prices. Hard Bargain perk in charisma will also affect those values and can be upgraded to rank 3. 
---
However, items will have a max value when selling or buying. Meaning even if you increase charisma to 50 somehow, you will never be able to sell item for more caps once you've reached that limit.
---
One is a game designer that worked on Forza series, but thanks for the useless comment...
---
I am on PC and usually play nights (after 9pm PST) and weekends.  I'm JudeAlexander and I need this too.
---
I just ended up doing the Hunter, Athlete, and Archer challenges. Raged pretty hard  doing the one quest where you gotta gather insect materials. Those stingwings are brutal. Also learned some weird tech with the crossbow and having to repair it 3 times. Rather than shooting it, you just bash things which makes the condition go down a lot faster. Probably shot like 150 bolts till I tried looking up a better solution. It didn’t help that I had a higher intelligence and made a high level crossbow which started the condition at like 150%.
---
Just quick change view from first person to third and back. It completely cancels the animation.
---
Or how about a faction camp. One that has a large area and is set in it's own server so it remains there for all the faction members.
---
You can find plans all over the place. In random spawning locations in the world, by completing events, by claiming workshops, or by just buying them from in-game vendors or player vendors. Sometimes higher level players will drop you their duplicates too. 
---
Sales prices to vendors is based on some things like your charisma, the perk hard bargain, chems, etc. Generally, you’ll never get the suggested price, it’ll always be lower. 
---
Ores can be broken down at chemistry stations with acid. You usually need a few ores to make the base material. 
---
You have to be careful where you build your camp. If it’s near fixed enemy spawn locations or near random spawns, you’ll frequently get unwanted visitors. Scout the spot before you start building, server hop a couple times to see how that area changes. 
---
You can lock doors in your camp. It’s L3 or R3 on PS4, can’t remember exactly, while you’re in the build menu. Not sure what it is on other consoles. 
---
I’m not 100% certain where people spawn in, but a general consensus is it’s near where you first place your camp box. For me personally it seems to always be off to the side a little from that center spot. Hopefully they listen about the spawning mats!
---
You're okay with a game as broken as 76 and Bethesda's response? LOL what does todd have to do to stop you from giving him money?
---
Didn't the challenge expire like 7 hours ago?
---
You can lock doors with lockoickung perk and done in build mode; you can also lock resource extractors and water purifiers. Fast travel is based on location of your c.a.m.p. device.
---
Orange shag carpet, orange shag carpet, orange shag carpet!
---
You barely have any defense. You are going to die. A lot. 
---
I would drop the top 3 of your slugger cards and buy either barbarian or blocker. Hell, drop 2 each and buy both. You'll still hit plenty hard for like 90% of enemies to die in one hit.
---
1. You can get many plans by doing events, particularly taking over workshops. For example, gorge junkyard is a good one. It's right up the road from the overseer's camp. When you do the quest to claim the workshop, you will always get a plan. Then immediately after claiming, you will get a quest to defend the workshop from Intruders (usually robots or dogs or ghouls). If you complete this you will also always get a plan. Otherwise, you can buy them from other players, find them randomly in the world or in containers, or get them as quest rewards. It's completely random which ones you get though, unless you buy them from the vendorbots.
---
2. When you sell your items to vendors, you only get a portion of the actual value of the item. This is there to keep the amount of caps players have lower than the prices of buying items, to keep the in game economy in check. You can however get better prices by picking up the hard bargain perk (charisma) and also by using grape mentats (a chem).
---
3. You can smelt any ore you find into scrap used for crafting at a chemistry workbench (smelting costs a few pieces of ore +acid)
---
4. Enemies are spawned to attack your camp, and they will usually try to destroy your structures. I don't know why, but it's best to build some turrets to help defend against them.
---
5. You can lock doors (and other things). If you go into the build menu and highlight a door (or water purifier, or resource extractor) and if you look at the bottom of your screen you'll see the button prompt to lock it (on PS4, it's L2). You can make a lvl. 0 to lvl. 3 lock, and you'll automatically get a key for it. The level of the lock is there as a skill check against other players who might want to pick the lock, they will need a picklocking skill equal to or greater than the lock you build.
---
6. It's hard to figure out where players will spawn in to your camp. You can't designate your own spawn point (which really sucks). But it's been determined that moving your CAMP module around within your camp can change it, but it's a little finicky to get a good spawn point, especially if your on a cliff.
---
Climb up the mountain east of Whitespring Station.  Was chased by one after 2 min.
---
He's still a rare vendor. Figure people might just want to look through his inventory.
---
These look like blue tv static and it’s only with certain trees
---
Same thing happened to me, just reput it all up, super pain with the clunky controls for assigning caps prices. It’s either done 1 at a time or by the thousand...
---
What’s the swords lvl
---
You are an excellent example of a Troll:  useless posts, no idea what you are talking about
---
Blocked and reported
---
Player vending machines should reduce weight. 
---
I never had a problem with weight but now my stash is filled with loot waiting to be sold.
---
I was able to repair all of my camp last night minus the mutfruit that was destroyed because I didn’t have any on me. Either a bug or we can do this now.
---
Not an expert, this is my opinion....
---
I think that's to stop cheating, such as maneuvering someone into a sniper's sights or loading up a mule character easily. It does make sense though, if you're on two separate servers, you can't influence each other's game. I know some friends had this problem with Destiny2, not sure how they fixed it.
---
It's also very hard to read the letters and notes. I actually have to get up and get a few feet from the TV to read them.
---
Also, I love that other people's C.A.M.P.'s show up on the navigation bar now but why not give our personal C.A.M.P. icon a different color than other C.A.M.P.'s.
---
All on wifi? Try one direct.
---
I just empty my cores each time I use mine.  Since most of my cores are 100%+ there’s always one low core in inventory but I just leave it and it’s not a problem.  Mosltly I just unload on the queen with it.
---
I was honestly dreading that. Never making another character. The grind is not worth it lol.
---
For me it’s ticks so many damn ticks
---
You have to loot it normally otherwise it doesn't count
---
To compare, here is what I went with for my Grognak build...

---
Wow really I’m going to put them in my vendor for 4.5
---
I desperately want the bonfire plan but I can’t find it...
---
if i keep it like that for the begining can i swap it out? also if i use power armor wont it give me hgher defense?
---
Ok
---
Did you get a shot in before it died?  If you didn’t tag it, you don’t get to loot it. 
---
Some OP asshole killed it in one shot last time I did it. He was the only one who hit it. There were about 5 other people, all pissed they didn’t get anything from the Wendigo because we couldn’t get a hit in.
---
I was thinking just add a 30% discount to fast travel to camps let it stack with Travel Agent. I love going around looking for a good wep I want ( currently seeking a 2 shot bloodied Fatman but can't afford one lol)  but wow fast travel gets expensive after a while especially with camps in the Mire and such
---
The easieat way to farm badges is to server hop and try to get campfire tales to begin
---
Sounds a bit unnecessary and more cumbersome than what they have now. I personally like the way the camps are set up and enjoy not having more stuff gum up the servers. The level of moderation this might require might not be possible, their resources are stretched thin already and, they probably won't want to dedicate any employees to this. Just my thoughts.
---
Mechanic is not rare don’t sell it
---
+90 damage/energy/rad resist, at the cost of -30 carry capacity. On the flipside, the extra pockets backpack mod adds +60 more carry weight and reduces your energy and radiation resistance by 60.
---
Why does swimming have us perform CPR with a syringe?
---
I wouldn’t want this personally. Having to hold the button instead of being able to maneuver in the air after my jump like I always do wouldn’t be the best. I do admit I do want the normal jump from time to time but I’m not sure if this is the way.
---
But do I have to pay for shipping? Or is that free too
---
Extremely vague credentials, refuses to name a specific game or position, when and how long, what position and what they actually added to the game... This is literally everything I expected for a response
---
Have a look at  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk9r2t/daily\_outfits\_and\_what\_are\_raider\_clothes\_hat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bk9r2t/daily_outfits_and_what_are_raider_clothes_hat/)
---
You can always swap. You could use those stats to easily switch to a heavy gunner or shot gunner or one hand melle at any time if you want. 
---
And even in power armor I would take blocker. Too many enemies are mellee.
---
Go all commie and use the AK aka Handmade.  If you can get a 1* Anti Armor or Bloodied it totally rekts!  The reload is a little slow though.
---
Thanks. I hope you’re able to get it. I feel bad for my one friend, he’s barely finished with the whole quest and it was glitching super hard on him.
---
I never knew how much bees straight up hated lawn chairs until I played this game.
---
Ok that is a valid point... hmm might take this idea down.
---
Glad you like fallout 76. I purchased 76 for $80 back in November.  I endured like others a 400lb stash limit and prodded my way thru. I play as a lone wanderer and don’t build my camp like the sims. It’s been a long haul but the fun is exploring everything. What I say is take your time, do things by yourself and enjoy the game.  It’s fun and addictive!!!!  🤠
---
I don’t know if I’ve ever read one. On a 55” tv sitting 5’ away!!
---
so it seems stealth/sneak isnt necessary a
---
Hey better than someone completely overrunning your camp with every inhabitant of the Whitespring Golf Club
---
I started a new character recently and no real drive to go back on my other one (melee was getting stale). I'm level 16 so I haven't built a shop yet (don't really have much to even sell atm). But I'm sure I'll experience that pain when I get around to it.
---
I guess I'll have to invest in some heavy duty defense =P.
---
Both hard wired.
---
That's what red dead 2 does and honestly it's a life saver.
---
It’s every Bethesda game too! It’s crazy that after all these years they still haven’t addressed this issue. Btw, it’s not just you or the impaired. At least this game isn’t heavy on books (eso).
---
Ty so much i think its worth it for extra resist
---
I noticed it today when I was deleting pictures to make room for some of the quests/dailies that I had 8 pictures of me humping corpses. Only 3 made the final cut.
---
No one has ever told me they've blocked and reported me before, is this what becoming internet famous feels like it, am I finally a star mommy?
---
It's something every ps4 owner should know and I don't like that it's never really mentioned anywhere on the system, but I'm not sure where/when they would tell you about it
---
WHAT ON EARTH
---
Considering that the responders stole their vendor bots from Whitesprings they may no longer be welcome there
---
I'm on Xbox, but I'll have a look in settings just in case. Thanks!
---
I saw a guy selling a snallygaster spit attack for 25k. That's quite a markup for an item worth negative four trillion caps.
---
&gt; "I largely stopped playing because Bethesda made it more difficult to earn free stuff. I don't care that it's free.... It should be easy to get too. And it's ruining the rest of the game for me....... Somehow"
---
When they go out of their way to defend the Atom shop and what they add to it with "you can earn tons of it in game". That kind of is an issue, as they are making claims that you can earn tons of it in game, yet now they are making it nearly impossible to actually earn it.
---
The fact you feel that beth can do no wrong shows your opinion on anything about this game is worthless, as you are so biased it isn't funny.
---
No I have friends who play from the same house with out this issue.  I was going to tether one to my phone to see if it makes a difference though.
---
There is a main quest with some memorable moments like “Into the Fire”
---
I had a camp set up close to the Thunder Mountain substation that had a Deathclaw spawn, netted 5-6 gears per, just north of Watoga (aluminum and steel). My other camp is in the northeast, about 15 caps east of the Sunnytop station. Wendigos spawn at a tree with a truck hanging from the branches. That's 5-6 screws per as well. On occasion, I'd get up to 4 wendigos per server.
---
How about listen to their customers that begged over and over for single player where it wasn't always online, and not a "live service" because of exactly those reasons.
---
Add me Jay_31_ I'll be on in an hour or so.
---
live n learn. 1.) dont bring junk to ANY event. 2.) dont gather junk during any event  3.) if you gather during event, expect to drop it.  with these powers combined YOU ARE CAPTIN PLANET!!!
---
Also a water filter weighs 0.25 and is unaffected by any perks whereas the purified water itself weighs 0.5 and can be reduced to 0.05
---
Water filters should be weightless or weigh very little, it would make them worth crafting.
---
No. Don't, Bethesda.
---
Do like 2 repeatable quests from the two other counselors, and then complete 3 tadpole challenges. It sounds easy, but each step involves some grindy process. Like for the archery challenge, one of the steps is killing 50 enemies with a crossbow, and another is repairing it 3 times. Or there’s the Hunter challenge which some of the steps involve killing 3 yao guai. One with a machine gun, the other with a shotgun, and the last with a syringer. I don’t even think I’m gonna even try any of the backpack upgrades. I’m fine with the 60 carry weight tbh.
---
So pop some RAD X. You knew what the mutation was and wanted it...
---
Defend a settlement?! I’m on it
---
Seriously, some people think all sharing is communism. Up until they need something..
---
Suffer the consequences of rads. Name of the game. You clearly wanted it.
---
A bug I think, I wasn’t able to today and all I was missing was materials to replace frog prince and some crops.
---
Check player venders. I bought one today embarrassingly cheap.
---
Yeah, would have to get in the air then move with controller. Not an issue on PC tho
---
At least refill the fire, ya?
---
A go formatting would long a little way...
---
Did you find if it's a static spawn?
---
Same to the level 10 who stole mine after one violent night
---
I thought he would at least hesitate out of common courtesy, but no. He fucking yoinked that shit as soon as my body fell to the ground.
---
Finally a bug we can get behind.
---
sounds like a win win
---
Its the actual worst thing ever. I’ve never really gotten into MMO’s or MMO style games before. But damn I truly know how people who play those games feel now when it comes to grinding.
---
I always thought it was supposed to be that the jar was made for a regular sized frog while the scouts were active before the war, and now the frogs are so mutated that they barley fit in there now.
---
Not the fix you want, but you can cancel that animation by stowing and readying your weapon just ahead of landing.
---
You sir, are a bad guy
---
remember it's separate mods for damage, enery, and radiation resist, but I agree. I went with radiation resist, since that's harder to come by and I don't want to put Lead Lined on all my armor.
---
Not being able to understand basic instructions seems like a major fault in this community. The Sheepsquatch was made impossible too due to people not being able to read “activate the pylons”
---
Yea u still need to complete the quest
---
I’m on xbox. Sorry I forgot to mention that
---
That's just a skin for the backpack
---
Ah, that's my theory shot down then 👉😕💥
---
So you can only have +90 in one of them at a time correct?
---
How much extra carry weight does a backpack allow ?
---
yea, ive been burned like that and it sucks. but atleast it wont ever happen again
---
Too bad, I'm PS4.
---
I was talking about bulking ammo into cases in real life cases. Like this for example: 5.56 ammo comes 20 bullets to a case
---
[https://i.imgur.com/f1RLaSl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f1RLaSl.jpg)
---
If you want power armor don't bother with stealth. You're probably going to have to do the run up and smash them thing. 
---
Otherwise, in standard armor with the right mods you can sneak right up to almost everything and not be noticed. It's very powerful. 
---
I can do a quick ninja build for you if you want. That's my main's thing. It's more one hand crit based though.
---
I plead guilty until the one I just did. I didn't realize what it wanted I was looking for wood piles or logs to gather
---
I KNOW RIGHT I BASICALLY DO ALL THE WORK BECAUSE PEOPLE CANT READ😤😤
---
We need a van building kit. With the shag. It would be an awesome camp item.
---
I believe so. I mean, there are sealed vaults throughout the game. It'd be cool if we gradually got some real NPC's as time goes on and vaults open.
---
I, too, love listening to the cryptid holotapes as I’m wandering around exploring. They add an old-timey “radio drama” feel to the game.
---
In fo4 I loved listening to the Silver Shroud radio station for the same reason. Great suggestion!
---
I can't believe you're failing it, I've been able to Kindle it solo with 2 people killing exclusively atleast 3 times with no failure
---
Yup, Armor Plated for damage resist, Insulated I think for energy resist, and Lead Lined for rad resist
---
Yeah, I created and immediately scrapped as well, same reason. No big deal, but it is a bit distressing. Probably a market for a Deluxe Frog Environment in an aquarium or something in the Atom Store.  Or maybe a reskin of the concrete fountain, full of stagnant water and lilypads for Prince to hang out on.  They got me on the fish lamp, they'd probably get me again with this.
---
Probably same people who will complain saying game is impossible to beat, that it's bugged and can't complete. Sadly it's not just the gaming community, i see this all the time at work to.
---
For how long?
---
no pain no gain
---
Is that a futurama reference, nice.
---
You have to unlock the backpack through the quest. The atom shop thing is just a skin
---
Mine spawns a lot of nuclear convoys. I get 3-4 per night. On a related note, anyone on ps4 looking to buy key cards, stop on by. Psn: mike_4570
---
Yes will take it
---
Ok, just thought it would be a nice qol feature that could be added.
---
I did serve hop but the prison hadn't reopened yet.  I'll be going back shortly
---
 Depends on what your trying to do. Are you a lower level? Or a certain kind of ore?
---
It's different at different levels, but the max level backpack adds +60 carry weight. With some mods like Refrigerated or Lead Lined it only adds +30 carry weight, and with the enhanced pockets mod it adds +120 carry weight at the cost of -60 energy and rad resistance.
---
I can’t even IMAGINE what these guys would be like in a Destiny raid where you have to follow complex instructions in synchronized movement
---
According the the vague holotapes left behind at whitesprings it looks like all of the residents were forces to leave by the bots after a year. No explanation as to why they did that but looks like no permanent residency
---
I traveled to watoga bought the plan for cheap
---
I don't know what to say.  If you're too lazy to get one shot in or too pigheaded to use a weapon that doesn't gain one-hit damage potential from your build, then I don't know how to help you.
---
Wehre is the event I haven't seen it pop once.... and what does it give you for rewards?
---
I was hoping for either a lead or junk deposit that's near the center of the map
---
Lol yeah.
---
Also can you have more than 1 backpack? Like 1 being used and 2 in the stash?
---
All good thanks!
---
Yep it erases facial hair, glasses and bandanas. It’s a good thing there is no cold brew or ipa in the game, it would erase those too. Lol
---
Half the time it’s my friend whenever he fast travels to my camp theres been times where a ghoul is stuck also
---
Yeah I got kinda annoyed that I spent badges on it without realizing it was the wrong outfit. I assumed “uniform” meant long pants and not shorts like the other outfit has. In the tadpole vending machine, and outfits are correctly labeled as “shorts” and “skirt”
---
i like tanky two handed but please do so so ican have it for 2nd character
---
So is that like a curse? Will his children also suffer from this when they play?
---
There's a popular junk spot across the street from the RR near the top of the world. There's also a lead spot in the mountains north of WS. Lots of veins for aluminum too
---
Damn you imperials and your bows
---
I had the same issue after rebooting modem and router and completely shutting down both xbox [not sleep mode] it was fine for me
---
I mean, that's one of the risks of having a CAMP at Whitesprings. Gotta have cons with the pros.
---
Exactly! It’s all so direct and simple... it’s INFURIATING to see people mess it up.
---
I have a similar problem when I'm in my power armor. Normally a compass will show an outline of place/ building that you are getting close to. Which is helpful when it comes to finding places you haven't discovered yet. But when I'm in my power armor, the icons are almost invisible and I have the opacity all the way up. I can barely even read the direction. I thought maybe it was just me or my tv.
---
Did you have a bounty or did you just die?
---
I mean... you can fire the wood yourself, so unless you’re guilty of being lazy too...
---
Just let them kill the bugs while you stoke the fire
---
I thought the point of survival was to just shoot each other and not do anything else.
---
 As far as I know you can still do that.
---
Only thing not great on it is the endurance. Sounds like a great weapon
---
Camp Adams
---
Only spawns at night when someone is in the area
---
French too
---
I just wish we could have fast travel mats for our camps, and be able to set an arrival spot
---
Oh come on. There are more single player games than multiplayer in this franchise and we literally had the latest main series installment in 2015.
---
If you expected a new main fallout game this early and **still** haven't accepted that 76 is an online spinoff that exists then you're a fool
---
I really dont like that most of the big side quests are actually the main quest.
---
It’s actually not that bad of a color!
---
I was one-shot by a mongrel at low health and didn't even kneel. I have pacifist mode on so I definitely didn't have a bounty.
---
Go ahead and try.
---
I'm not familiar with this bug, could you elaborate? 
---
As for resetting a quest for you, good luck with that lol
---
My character was bugged, completely bypassed recruitment blues questline and continued onto defiance has fallen questline. Opened case back in January. I have yet to receive an update beyond their generic "we just did maintenance, are you still experiencing the issue?"
---
Camp Adams - only starts after 9.30pm when someone is at the location
---
That’s rough buddy
---
What does it reward?
---
They are the attacks most of the time.  I'm set up by a little pond in the Cranberry Bog that is barely big enough to accommodate my two water purifiers and I've become quite familiar with the spawns.  Right outside the entrance to  my camp, facing east, is a small patch of trees that spawns two ticks.  Slightly south-southwest is a spawn that spawn passive critters, usually 2-3 beavers.  Less frequently, my camp seems to spawn slightly more dangerous enemies which typically come from somewhere north.  I've had plenty of super mutants drop by and I saw a couple of gulpers spawn once.  Occasionally cave crickets from the south too.
---
Part of the problem here is the event itself changes. Sometimes you just pick firewood, sometimes you need to actually feed the fire.
---
You can keep them in your inventory too
---
Just rename them all what they do
---
Ok I found it thank you! Pretty excited to get home from work and do some killing.
---
Just started playing.. seeing the health of my walls every time I walk by sucks from an immersion perspective.. is there any way for me to repair an camp item even if it’s only partially damaged? Is there a repair all function?
---
After getting rid of all my useless legendaries for scrip I now always have a couple hundred room spare in my stash. Just sell things, get rid of things you don’t need. 800 is plenty until they can make it stable enough for more.
---
You don’t know what you’re talking about. When there are 4+ people in the event, the meter drops too fast to be able to run to each tree by yourself and pick up the kindling while a hundred bugs swarm you at every tree and half the kindling is wet
---
Its not from dev room but its from a mod that ive heard a few people were able to make (from what i know, it was never released to anyone apart from people who made it themselves), that allowed you to craft items from fallout 4 such as the bowling ball launcher, the laser that preston uses, that power armour and a few others
---
Random chance of getting either 
---
* possum badges
---
* the s'mores recipe
---
* scout tent plans
---
* or none of the above and just some caps and exp
---
Yup, or use the stairs.
---
True that
---
I'm always hearing about how tough it is out in the work force, but I'm only putting in moderate effort through college and flying miles above everybody around me. I refuse to believe it's as bad as people say it is. Is merely being competent already a qualifying trait nowadays?
---
So a better way to get the backpack mods then spending the next few weeks trying to grind a badge.
---
Now we just need walls with smooth wooden paneling.
---
Yeah I think I did cuz I finished her off after scrambling to reload my black powder rifle before she was gone and I downed her at like 1/3 health with a critical, it gave me the message that I hit her with a critical and then she appeared to fall through the floor. Everyone else looked as confused as I did and a few of us combed the area but nothing
---
Yep happens to me all the time! After about a month one of my turrets will just disappear into oblivion at every camp i make.
---
It has a chance of giving you a possum token. Aside from that, it's the usual - purified water, chems, ammo, caps, exp. I think there are a few CAMP plans based on the scouts that it can give you as well, maybe a chance for the new food too
---
Yeah pretty irritating issue lol
---
Yeah - but it is really random. Sometimes I have gotten nothing, then other times I got 3 badges.
---
I ended up moving my camp. But I found a workaround by putting the turrets on daisy rugs. Helps till they fix it at least.
---
I hate the event just because not only am I melee and cursed with VATS being disabled against 100 bloodbugs but I can't even sneak to be left alone or avoid armor damage while I gather stuff since you're automatically in \[Danger\] forever regardless of sneak skill :| So I have to strip naked and let them suckle all me till I manage to smack them.
---
It's all good until the game starts changing the names of your custom PA frames around, which has happened to me multiple times now.
---
Yeah, the change was intentional. Also, Watoga station now has better lighting inside.
---
Reminds me of the tin man encounter from fallout 2
---
I just moved my camp and rebuilt from the ground up for player vending. My new camp is also right next to a spawn point.... for frogs, squirrels, opossums, foxes, etc. 
---
Whenever I get a customer I also get a free lunch!
---
Not stealing. But being opportunist. Simple game mechanic to make death feel like something you don't want to happen. If Bethesda didn't want this to happen they would never put it in game. Don't carry expensive or rare stuff with you if you are afraid to lose it.
---
Think the only TNT Domes right now are 2, 3 and 7.
---
Ah I see. Thanks for clarifying~
---
Should be, haven't gone on in ages.
---
Can't guarantee I have it though, I'll get back to you
---
Just go here.  The latest codes are always here.  [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
What did the mongrel shoot you with?
---
Not sure if it's related, but I've got a similar issue, except I'm on a boat and my "interior" items keep going on my roof instead.
---
I read something about placement fixes, something about tents and placing things under them, so I guess that's what's causing some of it.
---
The game is in a much cleaner state now. The launch was pretty rough, we don't have the gamebreaking bugs and only have some of the really demotivating ones. Probably the biggest issue nowadays is stuff not spawning in properly or disconnects/crashes. Back then it was the damage bug making your enemies invincible, getting stuck in an unusable power armor frame, and mass duping (at a scale the current exploit doesn't even compare to). 
---
Aside from that, a lot of the hate was blown way out of proportion to begin with. I think the biggest real failure with f76 was with its marketing - there is still plenty of story, there are some really interesting personalities with the current NPCs, and there is lots to do even for high levels. It should have been more prominent from the start though that this is different from the mainline games
---
Not true. I have 3 xboxs. 2 game share. We all have no problem playing together .
---
It's usually a router issue.
---
If only I had three left legs...
---
My son puts on his Hazmat Suit to collect water.
---
Not really I’ve done the event a dozen times and haven’t gotten anything but the tent
---
THEY BELONG IN A MUSEUM!
---
So isn't fever blossom or royal jelly.
---
But as everything else in the game it is grindable - it's just the matter of value you name it.
---
And by definition a shadow currency is a non official intended ingame currency or am i wrong?
---
Point is - the max cap level was not enough? Why? Because all want (mostly duped) god-tier weapons and the prices raised?Demand determines the offer.
---
But i think that was not the topic, and as you've got nothing to add about that i'll just take as it is.
---
Sorry if you are somewhat affected by the topic, at least by the eager respond, but still - from my side duping and all whats based on it was and is wrong and hardly defendable. But we don't have to agree. That's ok.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Cool, the meter moves too rapidly for me to do it alone
---
First time i did it was with 1 other person, we failed because i didnt know kindling was a seperate item pick up. I was gathering wood.
---
Except it just keeps happening, after repairing I noticed all the vending machines are still heavily damaged. I rarely ever had to repair my camp before, now the creatures spawn so frequently and score small damage that over time is destroying stuff a lot.
---
I have logged off and back on with no success.  I have rebooted also with no success.  Came back from work, tried again twice and no machine either in WS or in Watoga.  Not sure what's going on.
---
Let me check this out.go to advance settings right?
---
I only speak for myself but I could care less.
---
I had this problem with house plants/succulents for the longest time regardless of location, so I'm not sure if it's related but thanks for posting. To me it appears like they intentionally changed something with the meshes and collision in the area, including the placement of new invisible walls. Have you noticed any new invisible walls/inaccessible areas near your camp since the update?
---

---
how is this? i read you can sneak with power armor
---
Also PLEASE make bags easier to see. If I respawn and go back to get what I dropped, seeing a grey bag on a grey brown ground is next to impossible. I’m not saying put a white light shining up from it. Wait. That’s what I am saying. Please add a white light shining up from it.
---
I think yeah, when you tie it all together. The sealed vaults, the fact that the brotherhood went on this grand quest that remains unfinished, the overseer's calls for taking control of the silos...there is definitely room for upcoming updates to expand on what's there. Hell, there are plenty of places like the space station that are pretty much begging for future updates
---
Shhhhhhhhhj
---
I didnt like rage 1. rage 2 looks better and saving uo for it.
---
That's cool! I wonder then if your "biome" affects what spawns at attack events
---
I had the same yesterday with duplicate deathclaw gauntlets. 3 of them.
---
I’d rather that they fixed the annoying bug where you jump instead of placing a wire first.
---
Swimmers doesn't work either

Ive seen several this past weekend. Most i was too late for but got in 2 queen fights. Alot of servers are dead though than you find 1 loaded with action. Launching a nukes a tadpole challenge so might see more.
---
No need to be petulant
---
I do know what I’m talking about, it isn’t hard
---
Don’t bother killing Wet Kindling bugs, grab dry stuff, run to next tree, let the clean up crew deal with all bugs
---
Work in a circle, as sometimes they don’t respawn fast enough to run between only two trees
---
You can't continue the quest line.  It seems like it happens at random spots for Missing Link.  It's the start of helping Rose.  
---
I deleted my mod files and I'm now reinstalling the game.  Yes I know the deleting mod files might have helped and deleting and reinstalling the game is really pointless. I'm only doing it in case I missed a file somewhere.
---
Uhh....what?
---
Where do the other caps go ?
---
Mine procs but I almost never get the notification. Noticed it while I was making stimpacks and had a lot more than what I had figured up but didn't get a single notification it popped.
---
I haven't played in a few days but the vendor update did not mess up camp placement for me at this exact location. I am built inside the monorail support and everything is placing fine. (A few days ago)
---
Not making excuses but aren't the servers Amazon cloud servers? Like I know nothing about servers and that stuff but wouldn't they (Amazon) have blame in this as well?
---
They also blocked off the staircase/escalator to the top floor where I need to register for advanced responder training. There’s another access point that requires an ID card to pass through, which I can’t find. This is a new character of mine. Do you happen to know how to advance to the next stage of the quest?
---
In my experience, all the added player activity is making the servers less stable. I've crashed in a nuke silo 20 feet away from the screws and ballistic fiber I dropped upon a robot exploding. Feels less enticing to launch nukes with that constant possibility of a crash hanging over you
---
Don’t imply I’m lazy. If you don’t want people to be rude to you, maybe don’t be rude first. Hard concept I know, but you can get it
---
I think your probably right it's something with my network setup. I just found it odd that on separate world's it works fine. I am testing different things ATM to see what I can figure out.
---
This is what I thought as well. Thanks for the input.
---
Same.. just got it and it’s been awesome. I really got into H1Z1 and Ark in the past purely for the survival, building, etc and imo fallout has done it substantially better than those before it.
---
Nope I think it's like that for most of us. it's one of the reasons I don't use power armor other then to fast travel.
---
I have a camp to the left of the bridge across from the overseer's camp in that little clearing on the river. I get house cats and stray cats and tabby cats, but also frogs, foxes, beavers, fireflies, deer. They like to spawn inside, so I'll have frogs hopping around, or kitties chilling, or a doe kicking the crap out of my weapons bench.Unfortunately there's a chance for level 3-5 scorched, liberators, or protectrons. But every once in a great blue moon, one or more of the scorched is unarmed, and glitch out, and aggro around your house, moaning like a bad B movie. Much creepier than you would think. It's my absolute favorite.
---
It is a popular spot, so you have to jump servers as often as not, but it's totally worth it if you want critters about.
---
Where’s your camp?
---
The fact that i keep logging on and playing kinda puts the blame on me at this point
---
Awe man is that what happened? Shit. I bought the Warhawk for my chick and couldn’t find it. Waaaack.
---
Meh, the minutemen had plenty of personality during my playthroughs. Since I was the general it's kind of my fault if they're boring.
---
This was today. I had nothing else destroyed, am in adventure mode and got no warning: came home to a trashed fusion generator. 
---
I love the new patch, but Jesus Christ Beth, is version control so goddamn hard for you you can't keep armies of inane bugs from cropping up?
---
My fusion gen is inside, behind a keypad door on the third floor. It is impossible to see let alone hit with anything.
---
There's not even an imagination reason why this should have happened it just did, that intop of all of my turrets randomly breaking when I fast travel to my camp?
---
How in the fuck do you manage to do this shit, for real?
---
How? It's gotta be a record of some kind for spaghetti code or something.
---
Might be a massive coincidence, but I killed a ghoul with a 1* anti-armor combat rifle and it dropped me another 1* anti-armor combat rifle. It wasn't in whitesprings though, it was at the sunked train yard east of watoga
---
Are they spaced out in groups of 3?  Could be an SOS....
---
It’s like a shao kahn looking thing.
---
Feel your pain dude 
---
I cant finish recruitment blues  obstacle course and marksmanship due to mild arthritides in my hands 
---
cant hit the keyboard controls fast enough for the  marksmanship  quest 
---
posted about it months ago 
---
finally just gave up
---
wasting for a  reply from Bethesda 
---
that and the \*\*\*\*\*\* disconnect from the servers  every 30 minutes 
---
make me long for  my sixty dollars back
---
Do you have Healing Factor and Scaly Skin?
---
I've noticed way more legendaries since the update. There used to be a 50/50 chance of me finding a legendary on my way through harper's ferry, and now I find 2-6 legendaries per run there. Hell, I found two 3* super mutant warlords standing side by side on the bridge southwest of the town...
---
To my knowledge you have to get a shot on her but her body is really glitchy for me. Honestly though she’s like level 15 &amp; one star so the legendaries are super shitty anyway. But still worth a few scrips 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Completely different games.
---
Renovation plans forced everybody out.
---
I was in PA wielding Grognak's axe. It seems not to be tied to your equip.
---
Yikes. It ain't that bad.
---
And I'm over here still looking for a dead tourist.
---
Are you on PC?
