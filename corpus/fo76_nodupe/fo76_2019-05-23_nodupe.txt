That's why I said directly impacted.
---
---
---
Or...wait for it...don‚Äôt feel like you have to store everything. Hurr durr.
---
Hmmm, any type of power armor T-45 and above and I‚Äôm pretty sure the Exterminator's legendary armor prefix works against Arthropods
---
I'm drowning in legendaries I'm holding to vendor...
---
Username... sounds about right.
---
I can't play at the same time every day. 
---

---
Sometimes I can play before work. Sometimes I can play after work. Sometimes I can play right before bedtime. 
---
This would really help daily logins feel like less of a burden.
---
[removed]
---
Ill be on in like an hour if you still need modded
---
Fortunately for you display cases are in fact coming :) they were supposed to be here a while ago but they keep being delayed :( companions seem inevitable imo. They'll possibly be bunched in with wastelanders this fall.
---
Have you been scripping them?
---
Looks like Congress. A bunch of blank faces starting at each other.
---
;)
---
Can you place stairs somewhere else for that floor then remove the others? Might have to do some shuffling around
---
Im looking for a furious meat hook with +1 strength and exloding on contact
---
I love how chill he is and you're just there, voice raised, attacking him for no reason. You went out of your way to interupt his game time and "interview" him because he makes speculative videos.
---
Oh great!!! I‚Äôll keep an eye out for you !
---
Sure thing!
---
I have. The script limit sucks.
---
The workaround that works for me is to travel to Gauly Mine or Greg‚Äôs Mine supply and walking up to Arktos instead of clicking join event or fast traveling to Arktos itself. I was able to do the event without crashing - I hope it works for you
---
I finally got to the point of launching my first nuke. I've got a few things that I'll need to do beforehand like stocking up on stims and making several hundred rounds of twelve gauge and 2mm. I'm really excited for it and I can't wait for my next day off so I can dedicate the day to nuking somewhere.
---
Is there a lot of hacking involved? If so, what's the average level of the terminals?
---
total weight of gun
---
it's better than bad, it's good!
---
I saw a lvl 400+ once. Absolutely dumbfounded. Would love to know their play time
---
 I got that Mod from the Raider Vendor at R&amp;G Station. Plans I would kill for. ;)
---
BE Gatling Plasma. Never seen them on PC
---
Ugh I know!!! I hadn‚Äôt been looking recently so I wasn‚Äôt sure if they got added in like the BOS stuff! Maybe I just have to do some searching and double check.
---
I'm on ps4 and have a max level 3 star quad tesla in my vending machine. I will follow up tonight when I get home with all the details if you are interested.
---
They still need to make it worthwhile. I don't care about some realigned lab coat, and a majority of people don't play unarmed builds. The rewards are lackluster, especially for what you're putting in to take down that terrible Fog Crawler.
---
Hacking is handy, but not necessary. Mostly it‚Äôs to shut down the turrets and robobrains. Level 2 I think. Robot hacker would be a more useful perk to use I think. 
---
I use All Rise and a sniper rifle.
---
Yeah I thought it was awesome - poor kid
---
Tried this after crashing 5 or 6 times today and it didn't work for me :(
---
Only reason I do literally every single event is XP and random legendaries and that specific event also drops meteoric sword so no, ore is not only reason to do that event. Not to mention ore is useless. Never needed one bit.
---
Did you buy it?  That is crazy expensive imo
---
Cause if your dad hasn't got a beard, you've got two mums!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Two beardless mums
---
That‚Äôs good I guess
---
Yah Rdr is kinda what made me used to having my actual beard, the Acadian
---
Also have bloodied Gatling laser and other bloodied stuff
---
I know right! Nice animation though. Lots of attention to little details from the FO universe.
---
I‚Äôm really sorry I know how frustrating it is :(
---
CONGRATULATIONS
---
You gotta disconnect before you get diconnected. Piss and food breaks are what I love
---
With the addition of the scouts it looks like Bethesda has a different target audience than the esrb rating suggests. The wastelands are surprisingly warm and fuzzy.
---
Nah I didnt. Doesnt do enough damage for how good it looks tbh
---
Moth man outfit is coming to Atom Shop. And dog helmets are in the game right now, so I expect a furry companion along the way. Good suggestions though.
---
Maybe joining the scouts is more your speed....
---
Give it a few days. Even the most dense tween will have it figured out by Saturday.
---
As a last resort, try fast traveling to the surface and run back through. That fixed a glitch I had one with the mainframes not clicking into place.
---
All right, thank you. I really appreciate the advice.
---
Too true!
---
I think I ran into him the other day. 
---
But he insisted on giving me every Legendary he didn‚Äôt want to use... right next to the Berkeley Springs station, and even after I explained, in clear terms, how the Scrip Machine and Legendary Vendor worked. 
---
‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt really use Legendaries.‚Äù
---
I was shocked, and tried to explain again. 
---
‚ÄúNah, that‚Äôs okay. Go ahead and take them.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for the kid if I ever run into him again. I‚Äôve got a TSE Radium Rifle set aside with his name on it, if he ever changes his mind.
---
I tried that. Didn't work :/
---
Ran it 9 times yesterday and one time today without issue. Last run  today crashed 6 or so times. Tried without power armor, with power armor, walking in, and joining event. nothing worked.
---
Well damn
---
A perk: Your rides over muttie- 10% bonuses damge to anyone with a mutation that can go up to 30%. Add in a little extra to the max rank with a  small chance to explode like a min nuke on death
---
Looks good to me.
---
Lol did you just make this up? By your logic 90% RW weapons use 90% less AP ü§£
---
"Reduced limb damage" is the Strengthened mod for armor. Not a legendary effect.
---
I'm down.  What would you like to do?
---
Yea I‚Äôm not trying to be negative! But I just wish things like this would be worked out quicker. So many bugs just make the game hard to play but know I can‚Äôt even play the event.
---
Try it, if you dont believe. Reduced weight is not considered
---
AAE 50 reduced weight.
---
I've seen rabbits spawn in that little wooded area right above the main entrance to the whitesprings bunker
---
As for deathclaw hides, they don't actually drop from deathclaws. I've seen them drop as random "junk" in metal crates, and gulpers sometimes have them
---
This is so far from correct it‚Äôs not even funny
---
I got it after buying the bullet and server hopping yesterday - I hate server hopping - sucks all the joy from the game - but so many things needed a camera I thought it worth the investment.
---
I saw the moth man thing in a data mine post but it looked like it was just the head. That person could have left stuff out though.
---
It does.  I think they underestimated that we‚Äôd be looking to rescrip 90% of what we roll. 
---
I think the limit should be designed to ‚Äúrelieve‚Äù the legendary inventory of an avid player.  If you are an occasional player and don‚Äôt amass that much lego loot, fine. But give the rest of us enough bandwidth to burn up our legos at a reasonably comparable rate to which it is dealt through game play.
---
Oof
---
Seems to be wide spread so I'm hoping it's just a week or so until its patched. We had a decent sized group ready to go and it was awesome making new friends. I'll have a little faith they'll fix it lol
---
That's why I think they need to refresh the vendors more during the day.  Every 5 hours max.  That still puts some constraint on it, but offers players who dont have a lot of time more options while allowing those that do want to grind all day more freedom.
---
I got a vamp ss super sledge with str. I used to use a bloody one but with the vamp I never need a stim. I find it works better for farming.

It was said in the past that the invisible ramp/stairs attached to each foundation were Bethesda‚Äôs attempt at allowing the AI for Molerats/Radrats etc to easily attack our walls and buildings. 
---
Who knows if that‚Äôs the real reason, but it does make sense. It‚Äôs one of many semi-annoying building quirks this game has. They should really consider another AI workaround if it‚Äôs true, but I much rather they figure out how they want Fast Travel mats to work first.
---
The little hill behind the white spring service entrance will usually spawn 1 to 4 rabbits based on personal experience.
---
I agree its my favorite. its currently on my t51b that I use the most.
---
Also, the skull mask removes your facial hair, which is a real shame
---
Yeah. 1,000 would be way better. An extra 200 really would help.
---
Kill all radstags you can craft grilled radstag with their meet and it gives you like +30 carry weight.  It's super helpful early game.
---
Oh so Reduced Weight doesn‚Äôt count huh? Lol how convenient for your argument, AP Cost is predetermined and weapon specific and does not change unless you have the affix 25% Less VATs AP Cost.
---
I'll help.  rstickman is my gt.
---
It's obviously more complicated, its actually more based on what stock and barrel and sight, but for the most part yea weight
---
Nuclear gonorrhea.
---
I've been doing pharma since it came out in search of the backpack
---
So here is the whole thing, but for the most part it goes on weight of gun

https://www.carls-fallout-4-guide.com/vats/
---
This is what I heard, but do we know specifics about combat vs handmade? This stuff is really hard to test accurately :(
---
Just finished my first run and wasn't able to pick up the pieces a fragrant venison that were laying out exposed. I got maybe 5 or 6 from the radstags after tagging almost all of them... most had something else or were empty. We were able to get to level 3 with 2 others helping collect. so I'm not sure if that is by design and only one player can grab the venison off a particular radstag. I thought it a lot fun otherwise, that 100 squatch though...  Server notification would be great, only 2 others showed up so we could really only do 1 room. I thought it a lot fun otherwise, that 100 squatch though...
---
Very nice.
---
Multistar.
---
Have a mutants 25 Gatling. It's my daily carry weapon. I think 25 might be the best mod for gatlings. I still carry the AAE one but it doesn't feel as effective and only does six more damage than the mutants and the fire rate seems so slow now.
---
&gt;Or we can forget the most important part about what I had said. **Can't spawn anywhere.** But I bolded it, since reading comprehension is your weakness...
---
Fallout 4 bud
---
You got the wrong sub my man
---
Yea I know. How different do you think it is
---
Didn't read the post, hey?
---
Vampiric, explosive gat with 20% faster fire rate.
---
Dying sucks, but the real problem is that you can't spawn anywhere. I can't figure out how the entire thread glossed over this fact...
---
New feature in 76. All jokes aside, it‚Äôs happened to me so many times. Stairs are a real problem because the game thinks they lead somewhere so you can‚Äôt remove them because then the game thinks something‚Äôs floating? Honestly idk but it‚Äôs awful.
---
I just rolled a bloodied explosive 2 star weapon https://imgur.com/a/ejIkrqt

 Dying sucks, but the real problem is that you can't spawn anywhere. I can't figure out how the entire thread glossed over this fact...

There was a full set, its just mainly focused around the head, a lot like most mascots.
---
No doubt. I just vendor heavy one stars at this point.
---
Figures this was the first squirrel challenge where I was running into squirrels constantly and I didn't have a drill. At least we only need to kill 5 of the 8 critters for the challenge.
---
Quad M79, please
---
It Truly is awful. Considering not playing for a week and hopefully it‚Äôs fixed next week. 
---
It‚Äôs so frustrating.
---
I just tested your theory with my handmade and it is 100% incorrect, there is no AP Cost difference from being fully modded to being stripped bare.
---
It must be something they do with respawning in events because the sheepsquatch used to do this too
---
For any raiders, a way around this is to have them wait to join your team until the get burned down, as they lay there invite them. Shoot, then your bud can seek revenge. Profit.
---
They apparently appear at Watoga now
---
I‚Äôve been getting sentinels like crazy when only got 1 before lol
---
Also if there is a floor at the top they will for sure not go away because then the do lead somewhere. Sorry, can‚Äôt really tell in the pic.
---
So the bastard with the TSE Rocket Launcher can hit it across the room without moving.
---
That's happened to me from time to time. I don't know what it is but it stops. Xbox
---
Clearly you‚Äôre a moron and aren‚Äôt old enough to hold a decent conversation. Got back to jerking off over your little YouTube crush. That‚Äôs a good kid.
---
They‚Äôre both very different beasts, running in very different ways, how is this something you don‚Äôt understand?
---
2* is the best way to get your first "good" weapon and then you can go for "god". Not everyone is 100+ and not everyone has enough time to farm that much. You have to try to cater to the whole player base not just super high levels.
---
Lol was a waste of your mats tbh
---
If it works on Mirelurks, it should work on Fog Crawlers.
---
Thanks, this is generally useful assuming the mechanics carried over and are the same. But it's weird as that blog doesn't seem to suggest weapon weight as a big factor in AP cost? Can you explain?
---
Using stealth boys plus a good build and set of gear, I prefer to solo groups, more caps for me and it allows the use of lone wanderer.
---
I have been doing scrips almost everyday since she came out. Tonight roll was worth it lol.
---
Thanks will check it out when next I'm on.
---
Thanks will check when next I'm on... Soo...gulpers u say... So go to the meat mart? Or gulpers lagoon? And when u say junk crates u mean junk piles?
---
This just gave me hope ‚ù§üòÇ
---
Good to know
---
Just rebuilt mine - was able to use the clip trick to have one 2x1 stair directly on top of a 2nd 2x1 stair, no problem.
---
The trick to it is to build a single temp sstair off a foundation, clip a floor to that, and then place a steel support beam coming up off that clipped floor. You can then have the 'upper' 2x1 stair clip to that support beam and slide a 2nd 2x1 stair block under the upper stair block to create a stairwell.
---
I'm not sure if I'm explaining that very well. Basically, a normal stair should have a floor clipped to it, at the post (found under stairs) on top of that floor, so it looks something like this:  
---
           |
---
         __|
---
        /
---
    ___/
---
Then clip the 2x1 above first (where the 2x1 is 'E')
---
           |EE
---
         __|EE
---
Then slip in the lower 2x1 stair) where the lower one is B:
---
        /   BB
---
    ___/    BB
---
You can then delete the first stair/floor/post, and your left with a nice, aligned  stairwell in a small space.
---
I wish that they would have hot fixed it today
---
I hope so too
---
That sounds good to me.
---
But I would do 6 hours, so there are 4 resets in a day instead of 4.8. Just so that things line up nicely, and the clock doesn't gradually shift for people that maximize resets.
---
It's centered around where you first place your C.A.M.P. object.
---
Had a buddy quit playing this past weekend. He couldn't deal with his PA dissapearing and his best weapons vanishing.  He just decided to stop playng and wait until things are fixed (good luck).  I lost 3 major weapons myself over the last month or so, 2 power frames, and random PA parts. Lately no problems with dissapearing stuff (knock on wood) so I hope the spam scrap bug is really fixed.
---
A group of four allows for more diverse builds, instead of just hey man use Setinel Assassins/ anti- armor explosive or get killed
---
Well I had just 500 left after I got the set so couldnt resist the new mask. :D
---
That was fantastic. I would love to see a Red Vs Blue type series with fallout. Damn that would be awesome.
---
Every once in a while you'll see "bonus" materials on stuff. Like you'll see "Screw" with the item stats when it normally doesn't yield a screw.
---
I'm sorry you have reached your limit for dumb questions and statements. Please send any additional questions or statements to Google.com
---
Ill dm you my psn id
---
You should try going from the speedy down to the prime..feels. like. Slooooooowwww mooooooooootioooooonnnn
---
I don't have one. If I even think to hope for anything its usually more generic like anything good enough to replace something I'm currently using.
---
Pathetic.
---
Its mostly talking of per weapon, not comparing weapons. But a 10mm is lighter so its "easier to shoot" compared to say a shotgun. The base ap cost goes by weight, and modified by fire rate etc of that type of gun. But very much in general a heavy gun has more ap cost than a smaller one. No formula yet exists, so best we can do is extrapolate from the very well investigated fallout 4. It is the same engine after all
---
No you can't change the radius. There are ways around this, as there are some amazing camp builders out there. As for wood..simply look for logs . They're free
---
I get that, it makes things a lot easier. Love PvPing with teams too, solo just becomes a little more fun sometimes because any complaint they have is kinda null since it's for example a 3v1. I'm not one of the guys that just stands in one spot though, have sentinals for those times I am standing still but especially with the latest patch it's better to dodge or keep moving than to just stand there. Especially with the explosive lazers of late.
---
Every once in a great while, I'll see an extra material or 2 listed among regular item stats. 
---
I always thought that's what Scapper perk was getting because when scrapped, it yielded the usual.
---
This.
---
Its dumb that transferring something from our inventory to our stash effectively makes it weigh ten times as much.
---
You get wood from logs on the ground
---
If there are any rocks or partially submerged logs, you might be able to rest the C.A.M.P. on then to get more water coverage. Otherwise, yeah, it's gonna have to be on the shore.
---
I'm surprised people are still trying to pvp in adventure mode. That's not what it's for. Go in survival mode to pvp, or the new Vault 51 mode when it comes out. Pacifist is the best thing to ever happen to this game. You can completely ignore griefers and they can't do anything about it. They can't even break your camp now.
---
Grafton vendor has a chance for mods and plans. It's tsndom which armor type you get, so you have to keep hopping.
---
If you're on Xb, I can add dense mods. Gt same as ID.
---
It is different engine actually.... are you just pulling this all out of your ass? You have absolutely no clue what you are talking about lol.
---
Rule Number Six:  THERE IS NO RULE SIX.
---
Rule Seven:  No poofters.
---
Sylvie and sons logging camp for wood.
---
Additionally you can't move the area incrementally. You would have to move your camp outside of the existing radius where the build spaces do not intersect and then go back and try to find a better position in the old build space (hoping it doesn't intersect with the area you just put down)
---
Prove anything you have said, I did.
---

---
It's my white unicorn...
---
Nice

Could you mod my metal chest armor please kind sir? Happy to pay or you can check out my vendor items.
---
PS4, and if you did that would be glorious
---
Nice, sent you a request. If I see you on I'll try to join your world.
---
The weight vs AP cost seem to only be somewhat valid within a single type of weapon. Since different weapon types have different base AP cost and this don't seem to have have a clear correlation with the base weight of each weapon type in general. Wish there were datamined info on this topic.
---
It is
---
You‚Äôve proven nothing at all, every single thing you‚Äôve said is something you‚Äôve made up, literally everything, the only thing you referenced was fallout 4 info which does apply to this game, then you said they both run on the same engine... lol do you  listen to yourself?
---
ive been buying every map i see. Most people seem to sell them for 20-50 caps which i find well worth it. Combat armor dense plans can easily get 25k. Im sitting on about 100 maps atm that im about to go cash.
---
Yeah for real
---
As a heavy weapon user, I only roll for 2 star ranged weapons. 2 stars is enough for either TSE, Bloodied Explosive or AAE weapons. A third effect (which are mostly kinda useless) isn't worth 40 scrip more.
---
Yes and the 40 lbs shitte gives lead
---
They both run the creation engine.
---
Thank you for the stuff
---
Nice pasta, still pathetic.
---
I, personally, sacrificed one 3* heavy weapons damage perk for bear arms until I had three different heavy weapons with 90% reduced weight. I don't use calibrated shocks on my PA, so dealing with the weight of multiple weapons can be an issue.
---
Use power armor with the stabilized perk for that sweet 45% armor penetration and a reasonably good boost to accuracy to all heavy weapons. Stabilized also appears to affect the auto grenade launcher (one of my primary weapons), which gives it even more value for a heavy build.
---
My build for reference: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f374e3a&amp;d=e40lt1c71a72sb0e10sr2id0sq2s32ls2ip2e52ib4p10s01sw2lu2pq1ep1l71ic4cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=battle&amp;m=

I'm unfortunately on Xbox, but protip - just revive someone in water. It'll net you both badges üòâ Good luck! (Also a note: Heart of The Swamp event is great for this if people show up.)

Dude that's awesome! ü§£
---
Don't bother with this guy, it's a three year old account with 400 karma. Probably just someone who just got their account banned or suspended jumping on an alt to scream at people freely
---
Go away with all 64 of your karma. Jackass
---
Ah that makes more sense to me- I didn‚Äôt take time to look but I bet you‚Äôre right with the way they talked about it. Like if you hate this game - why are you here
---
Holy crap!! Nice
---
Yeah I'm with you. The only thing that's still exploitable are teams. I'll often be on teams with guys i dont know and that's the only opening for things to go bad
---
The new event drops it
---
You have framework and engine completely confused lmfao
---
Aw man I saw you today but you were sleeping at your camp so I just poked around and left.
---
If you‚Äôre PS4 I‚Äôd love to sell you a camera
---
Just sent you a request on psn.
---
I think it‚Äôs actually pretty good, especially on a Max Level 3 star Weapon. I‚Äôm pretty happy with mine. A fully modded , max level Combat Rifle. And mines explosive. It‚Äôs not a ‚ÄòGod Weapon ‚Äò, but it does over a 100 damage per shot BEFORE any chems, bobble heads, magazines, etc. And that‚Äôs before the extra 10% damage per shot. It‚Äôs fully automatic and hits hard. Pair that with the Tank Killer perk, Tormentor, and I‚Äôm set. It‚Äôs my favorite weapon right now. It‚Äôs just fun. However, on a 1 Star Weapon, I could see it not being so great.
---
Cant have both explosive and fire rate broski
---
Day-um
---
It's called the creation "engine" right? Are you 12?
---
I wish. I have no gold. I‚Äôm still kind of new to Reddit.
---
Definitely out of balance
---
They'd have to limit that as allowing players to get 15 points in every SPECIAL stat would result in some insanely op builds.    
---
To put that into perspective you can only get 49 total points at the moment.  15 in each stat would be an additional 49 points meaning you would have double the amount of perks compared to now.
---
Lmfao now you insult my karma? That‚Äôs how I know I struck a nerve, piss off with your misinformation spreading
---
I had an Unyielding Cav's Rad Resist come my way today. It's all a gamble, but it eventually pays off.
---
Change your mind... you want us to convince you the game is bad??
---
Omw
---
I found someone thank you
---
I did not see it there today earlier.
---
I insulted your karma, because its obvious you never contribute or even know how to use reddit, and have the nerve to think you are right about something you have shown zero knowledge of
---
Normally as long as the floor has another set on it, it will let you remove one set... but not anymore. 
---
Also one piece of floor is floating, and only connected to a floor pie e with stairs, but won't let me remove it.
---
I never sleep at my camp, it must have been an imposter! What time was it?
---
From my personal experience not many people seem interested in buying junk, from what I can tell it's Legendary Gear, Plans &amp; certain Aid items that sell the best.
---
I definitely adjust my prices according to how much weight I have in my stash, which is currently why I'm having a fire sale
---
I am- GT is the same - I have one rn if you wanna join
---
I can mod your PG if you still need it, just let me know GT and i'll swoop on by.
---
Can someone enlighten me as to what bulking is?
---
A Hunters baseball bat with plus swing speed and damage resistance while power attacking.
---
nah - theyll iron it out I am still happy with it over all.
---
For sure. Don‚Äôt really know why I tried to explain it like I had facts. My experiences vary. It‚Äôs always difficult. That‚Äôs for certain.
---
I roll over, but it's different if you're doing armor versus weapons.
---
Or I can do the splitter if you want a badass PG flamer :)
---
Have the bloodied explosive auto assault rifle with armour piercing. Fave gun.
---
I would think every item is a database entry with multiple columns for all the stats, condition, etc. So there is probably some kind of performance to consider yeah.
---
Or you could just sort out what you don't use. I've got like 1000 copper, screws, metal, springs, wood, and plastic. Still got a shit load of space. Just manage correctly.
---
It's the single best game I've ever played in 35 years of gaming
---
I think I'd prefer they switch over to the weightless system of the vendor &amp; just have a unique item cap limit of like 200 - 300 &amp; no stack limit.
---
I got a Bloodied Explosive with Sprint bonus Combat Shotgun yesterday and went to a store in the Pleasant Valley and someone sold to a vendor a 
---
 Furious +10% damage and +1 agility western revolver. I now have 3 god roll western revolver and i'm not even playing a gunslinger
---
Yup the 3rd legendary effect is unneeded luxury, for double the scrip cost!
---
I don‚Äôt need the revive anymore, but this is the best way I‚Äôve seen it requested/offered so good on you lads.
---
You go to your tinkers workbench and pull up the ‚ÄúBulk‚Äù option. From there you can wrap almost any (broken down) junk time with 2 pieces of plastic. This gives Cap value on that item so you can sell them to vendors. Normally stuff like wood and steel have zero Cap value, bulking them will let you sell it then.
---
Friend said it reminded her of a type of art piece, which I have to agree is probably accurate for what the person was shooting for.

Either way, I dig it :P

Yes, mods like this exist out there

Enjoyed the story! Made me laugh a couple times.

Spruce knob has a hidden cave you need to swim to

Has a Punji board underwater, very easy to knock yourself / friend and get the revive

No what‚Äôs obvious is that you know nothing about game development and that you are so afraid of being proven wrong on a public forum that you will make up lies to sound like you have any sort of clue what you are talking about, I made my reddit 2 months ago to trade on this game lmfao, don‚Äôt act like your karma can‚Äôt from the fo76 sub reddit, you got embarrassed with facts and now you‚Äôre trying real hard not too look like a dumbass, keep doing idiotic things like insulting someone‚Äôs karma because they proved you wrong in an argument Lmfaoo I‚Äôm loving this.
---
Previously that meant they were mutating, generally into something stronger. I've seen it happen when regular monsters hit an irradiated storm or nuke zone barrier and they are "upgraded" in level and strength.
---
Game crashed. Loading again.
---
I roll exclusively 2* weapons because I stopped playing for months and I don't have any good weapons yet.
---
You want private.. play fo4 I like 76 because you bump into others
---
I think him going for a build is the natural evolution of characters in this game anyway. I started at pistol - migrated to rifle then migrated to heavy. to be honest even where I am at now I shift and tweak things. less and less adjustments though the last few adjustments i have made i ended up coming back to my current set up.
---
Scorchy bois, slothy bois, and muteies
---
Try selling the stuff to other players big caps in that

Green footlockers have dropped two hides for me so far. Rabbits are easily found up the hill behind the exterior Whitesprings bunker entrance (along with a couple squirrels).
---
Yeaterday went to that event and 17 players joined. God seeing one legendary 3 star quickly gets out of control
---
On now, If you get on lemme know!
---
Its a new effect
---
Bear arms is a must have given the weight. With it you can carry a .50, Gatling gun, and a plasma under 15 lbs total. I haven‚Äôt had much luck with explosive heavy weapons. They just don‚Äôt seem to have the umph. 
---
My go to weapons:
---
Gatling as my primary. It‚Äôs very accurate and does a tremendous amount of damage per shot. 
---
The .50 just because of the cool factor and it‚Äôs a good spray and pray. I don‚Äôt like the mini gun because it shares ammo with the gat. 
---
Bonus for TS or E. Even with the beef the damage increase per shot helps a lot. 
---
Laser Gatling or plasma Gatling for a third choice. I use a prime plasma and it does extremely well on the SBQ.
---
I regularly carry 3500-5000 5mm 3000 50 cal and a handful of plasma cores and fusion cores. 
---
Batteries included helps a lot. With bear arms you can easily carry 4-5 heavy guns and just need to manage the ammo. 
---
Power armor is a must to use stabilized for AA and then high strength to use all three heavy weapon perks. The strength helps for a melee backup as well but you do have to swap perks regularly.
---
Idk which containers share the same junk pool, but I know for a fact I've seen it in that big metal crate directly outside the tattoo shop where Biv lives. But thinking about it, scorchbeast guano piles might have them too
---
Just to let you know, your write-up convinced me
---
Nope, try it out. Martial artist no longer increases the gatling guns fire rate broski
---
You ever try using the harpoon gun? I‚Äôm curious if it would be worth it.
---
That's not vault 51s zax that's the knee in Washington DC that became self aware. This zax is a prototype.
---
I am the only person that provided any facts. You gave zero information. If you have 5 semi auto rifles, the lighter ones have less ap cost. If you have a few automatic hand guns, the heavier ones cost more ap. How do you think it works? Do you have any idea at all? I've played these games for 20 years, I'm pretty sure you have not.
---
90% are not ideal for a specific build or need...  agreed.
---
I prefer auto-assault rifle over handmade. Got a 2* zealots, (+30% damaged to scorched) with 25% faster fire rate. This is effectively a +62.5% damage to scorchbeasts and 25% damage to everything else, compared to the auto-assault rifle I was using before.
---
A 3rd star would have been great but unnecessary.
---
I can give you a hand in 10 minutes if you still need it.
---
There's a thousand different quests right now for the possum badges, we can collect all the mats and have everyone get their stuff done at once
---
A better photos after some testing- can't remove anything from this photos. 
---
Not Stairs, or Floors.  [https://imgur.com/a/BVpE82a](https://imgur.com/a/BVpE82a)
---
Nice catch!
---
OHHH Ok. That's what that is. I never paid attention to it because it's annoying to check it, just like you said.
---
I thought they were pop-ups on the screen, the ones that flash by either too quickly or when you're busy and cant divert your eyes to read it.
---
I very rarely get disconnected. I was pretty bad at launch though.
---
There a couple of lumber mills, lots of wood there.
---
I have a two shot * &amp; suppressor's * Gatling and prefer the suppressor's. Supressor helps with mobs like at West Tek where you are getting hit by multiple enemies at the same time. The bonus damage and damage resistance are good for mobs. I run my * gatlings regularly: AA,  bloodied and instigating are really good, but vampiric is my mainstay.
---
Still do at the moment, but might need go soon =(
---
I haven‚Äôt looked.   But many folks told me they are there now.
---
I've had it freeze up a couple of times during the event. Also PS4.
---
I call the bloated/charred ghouls "chonky bois" and I walk around whitesprings saying "where my chonky bois at?" And when they all come out of the golf shop I call it a chonky boi party
---
I think Biv has some issues. Aside from the obvious drinking problem.
---
I once got two daily quests from him at once. Was able to turn both in too. Would have been cooler if one of them didn't teach me tequila I already knew how to make but I'm not complaining.
---
Thx man
---
Thank you very much.
---
Furious Flamer with limb damage/+10% damage and reduced weight
---
Or a Medic Flamer with Vats Critical damage and fast vats meter
---
Hahahahahaha I hate to laugh but I totally understand. ‚ÄúMaybe if I put stairs here...no...wait now I can‚Äôt move those either??‚Äù I had to move the camp. No solution and I haven‚Äôt seen it acknowledged by Bethesda. I had a very similar structure. Every attached piece was unremovable.
---
What facts did you provide? Everything you said is wrong lol, you have OTHER PEOPLE even telling you you‚Äôre wrong yet you call a link referencing  fallout 4 info(which doesn‚Äôt even reinforce or state what you claim in the link btw) I don‚Äôt give a shit how long you‚Äôve been playing games you have absolutely no clue what you are talking about, someone just tested it for you and told you you‚Äôre wrong yet your still claiming weight has an effect, you didn‚Äôt even know this game was made on a different engine, you obviously don‚Äôt know anything by the way it looks. You can‚Äôt even provide a source for your claim, because if you think that link is it you are either illiterate or in denial my man. As I‚Äôve said before, weapon AP usage is predetermined by weapon type and is not affected by anything other than the legendary affix ‚Äú25% Less VATS Action point cost‚Äù just stop lol
---
Happened to me yesterday had to download 64gb of a game again
---
That's funny, I also got blessed with a nice Vampires explosive western revolver with 25% less vats cost. I'm running a heavy gun/sniper build atm, but I have been itching to try something new, and this was a nice opportunity.
---
Congrats on your nice roll!
---
what are you on?
---
Same to you!
---
Jumping on now I‚Äôll send you a friends request. Meet you at the pioneer camp
---
Not bad man, you can get all of them for like 1k, maybe less if someone has all of those and does a bulk discount
---
Sadness.
---
thoughts on the lmg? i have that and the 50 cal and it seems like i can melt things with the LMG quicker even tho my 50cal is a two shot
---
Gotcha!
---
Correct they cannot be dropped
---
I definitely do that too. I call it my "This shit weighs too much sale" and heavy weight items get a price drop.
---
... So wait, you're upset because your shitty clickbait joke was deleted for being clickbait?
---
Yea I know I just feel naked without em, trying to get em asap.
---
I like this idea a lot.
---
Mutant slayer dragon would suddenly be amazing
---
Anti-armor explosive combat rifle. Could not care less what the last effect is.
---
lol. na like xb1 PV ps4?
---
PC *
---
Oh platform lol.  PS4.
---
After I get my trash or pocket watch yes lol
---
The question asked by OP is how to tell ap cost between diffrent guns of the same type. The answer is weight.
---
And it definitely could've been worse, I only lost like 1/3 of my mutations.  But still, I feel so dumb right now.
---
dang. I'm on xb1. I'd help if I could
---
Rule 1: Don't Die 
---
Rule 2: Dont Crash
---
Rule 3: Having friends is helpful
---
No worries, I appreciate it.
---
I lost marsupial a while back before player vending. I felt so powerless.
---
Cool
---
The question asked by OP is how to determine the numerical value of the differences between the combat rifle and the handmade AP Cost, see you couldn‚Äôt even read that. The answer is not weight, keep hitting that crack Pipe bro.
---
Try to plan a build before you start sticking points around, as respeccing anything is painful and only available after level 50, one point at a time, sacrificing a perk card for each point move
---
[Use this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
Also, mutations and starched genes / class freak are amazing
---
I think the script limit is supposed to deter dupers, more than anything else.
---
I keep all mine because of habit.  I used to keep it in FO4 to eventually fill a bathtub with in my house to feel like a big shot.  Other times I would fill a random vessel with it and shoot it with a fat man to make it rain money.
---
Yup yup. Don't even try eating or drinking while you load in good chance you are going to freeze.
---
I don't know what to do without healing factor.
---
Hi There! Long Time Fallout Player chiming in with what I assumed was common knowledge that &lt;b&gt; It's  the Type of Weapon that determines AP cost - meaning a Handgun will cost less AP per bullet than an Assault Rifle or Mini-gun.&lt;/b&gt; This means it's not the Literal Weight of the gun that determines AP usage. I hope this helps because ya'll arguing is making my eyes bleed. ;)
---
Welcome fellow vault dweller! My husband and I just got back into it a lot recently after 6 months or so. We loved it from the beginning and still do but life gets away on you sometimes :)
---
As for tips, I would say to try and loot as much as you can. Of course everything is used for something but it will help you out once you try and build a camp. 
---
I would place your camp somewhere moderately ‚Äúsafe‚Äù (close to the vault itself or a low level/low spawn area) in the beginning just as a spot to quickly go back to, eat, drink, sleep, etc. It‚Äôs the worst when you come back and some super mutants have decided to rip it apart. 
---
Food spoils so only make as much as you need at the time. Don‚Äôt stock pile it. You‚Äôll end up with a bunch of rotten food (good for fertilizer later on though). 
---
Have fun and explore! Remember that enemies don‚Äôt gradually level up with you so it‚Äôs totally possible to be level one and have a level 50 legendary. 
---
Happy travels!
---
Yessir, and to take it a bit further, you can craft a small floor mat in CAMP mode and place some objects on that floor mat, pick up floor mat and you can place things where they normally wouldn‚Äôt.
---
So what's the answer? You have zero clue.
---
Ya that basically sums it up. I have a good fight sometimes but I'm guilty of insta killin too. Survival mode or pvp in general get no love on reddit. I wish each mode truely had it own set of rules for pvp and camp destruction
---
What's the point of making bulk junk?  It seems that you waste plastic and increase the weight for no reason?  I'm also only lvl 25 so maybe there's a higher level reason for this?
---
Much appreciated will definitely be using this
---
I haven't been disconnected in a long time.
---
Just use the sidebar to search for tips or guides. This question is asked all the time and there is tons of information on here. My recommendation would be to go roam around the forest area till you're about level 20 then move east to the great divide or south towards charleston. Don't go too far East into the mire or southeast into the bog till you're about level 40-50. And use this sub to search for anything you need.
---
I‚Äôve heard that it also depends on your internet speed, I have 1GB speed (never had a problem) but a friend who has 50 mb has this problem. His fix was to hard restart your Xbox/PS4, not sure about PC but I‚Äôm sure they have a similar solution.
---
Everyone on PS4 is selling them in their vending machines for like 500 or above.  I don't wanna pay that, I definitely remember getting them for 200.
---
Restock stuff that has been sold out of my vendors.
---
Good to know about the food cause I would‚Äôve just made as much as possible and came back to camp with a fridge full of flies lol
---
Added for future purchases
---
Why not go and get irradiated to develop them naturally?
---
All I wanted to know is how much less AP combat rifles use in vats compared to handmade do... does anyone have this info? Now I can't even keep track of the comments on my phone because they've been squished to the right so hard.
---
If you still need it I'm at the Charleston Herald if you want to trade revives. PSN AnachronisticUK
---
Because there's a bunch I don't want.
---
Lol It‚Äôs PREDETERMINED BY BETHESDA YOU FUCKING DIPSHIT NOBODY KNOWS, I literally said this 5 fucking times and so did the person who just commented below. Holy fuck you‚Äôre dense ü§£
---
On PS4, you can have your game saves sent to the cloud so when you reinstall a game, it pulls your save from there. I am speaking in general terms as I had no issue with losing saves for the games I had when i swapped to a PS4 Pro. I havent reinstalled 76 and i dont play RDR2. I own it, but my gf plays it and she doesnt play online. Game has never crashed for her.
---
heck yeah dude
---
I am. Lvl 180 doing that exact thing and trying to get whatever I can for badges psn is same as here
---
Upvoting because you don‚Äôt often see a 58-word long title.
---
I'm very surprised that Bethesda doesn't try to sell rare pets for your camp. Maybe it's on the to-do list.
---
Okay, I'm on Xbox. When is a good time to do this?  What supplies will you need etc?
---
Some items will not respawn for a week if you pick them up. Others respawn with a simple server hop. Certain plan locations only allow one pick a week. Not all plans work this way. So if you pick up the known plan in that location another plan will not appear for you for a week. Others respawn daily.
---
Is your camp by white springs? It was like 1 or 2 pacific.
---
Lol
---
Thank you for confirming this and for chiming in, watching this guy make shit up on the fly to save face on the Internet has made me lose just a little more faith in humanity than I previously had
---
There's something like that on zedge. It has ringtones. I currently have the one similar to what your looking for as my alarm to wake up. Nothing like hearing "nuclear strike imminent" as you wake from your slumber. My wife hates it...
---
Epic!!! I do love the random encounters if you place your CAMP in a good place. Im at a gate on Whitesprings and just today I travelled back to CAMP, when I arrived heard my turrents fireing, run round the front to see super mutant warlords x3 with a glowing behemoth fighting 5 bloated glowing ones fighting the whitespring robots in some sort of 3-way wrestlemania main event. I sit inside my garage area, make sure I get a few hits on everyone and collect the bounty.
---
Luck increases base durability of items found.
---
Agility increases action points and i believe it affects stealth.
---
Perception i can't help with.
---
There was a lot to do when it first launched I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed at this point haha
---
Thanks!
---
Perception for increased vats accuracy, agility to run further and more vats swaps, luck for low health running serindipity etc.
---
Ahhhh.   Ok.  That explains part of it.   Thank you.
---
Honestly this Respec system has been garbage since release. It should have just been an npc with a cap price...
---
Ok.  THANK YOU!
---
Yeah, it's just north of Whitesprings Station. I think I was on for a little bit at that time.
---
Find a workbench, choose repair, and then choose workbench repair. No kit needed for anything.
---
Firstly, grats on the little on! What platform are you on?
---
I agree something through the Atomic Shop would be great.
---
Kinda like the Witcher 3 and the potion, I like that.
---
When you inspect items at a workbench, there is now a separate "repair" menu you have to go to. It's annoying and unintuitive compared to the previous system. I don't know what the console bindings are, but on PC it's T to repair
---
I dont really mind the limit right now but for fucks sake make junk weightless in the stash
---
Your character would have already needed to do the quest once, but then can add it to the tracker.
---
Favorites of mine are One Violent Night, Someone To Talk To, Surface to Air, and Breach and Clear. (Still farming for that plasma grenade plan!)
---
I do like how the robots in the Enclave bunker mention if there is a quest to do for them.
---
It's really simple.
---
When at a bench. Lookat you keys at the bottom of the screen
---
For me on PC I highlight the item. Click V and then select bench repair
---
Let me know what you like purchasing and I'll keep it in mind.
---
I keep getting useless tamborines lol, been nothing but rolling disappoinment
---
It‚Äôs really the same reason why you might add one of these to your SPECIAL attributes, minus the ability to add to the perk card pool.
---
Well once you get over lvl 100ish there's no point spending points so store them for respec, got 70ish spare on main toon and starting to build spares on the other 4 toons now
---
I had a small room with a door on the roof, blueprinted, had stairs under room leading to the room. I could not place it with the stairs in place, it was intersecting with the stairs, even though it originally fit there.
---
I had to put another set of stairs in a different position, delete the original stairs, fill the hole in the roof. It would then let me place the blueprinted room where I wanted, then make a hole in the roof under the newly placed room and put in the stairs back up to the room. I could then remove the other set of temporary stairs and fill that hole in the roof.
---
Also built around a resource junk pile and if I move one wall near it, I cannot put it back. Removing the one wall triggers the everything is suddenly intersecting problem. I need to remove all the building around the junk pile and the resource extractor itself and try to find a starting point to build again.
---
Building a Camp can sometimes feel like playing a jigsaw puzzle game with a couple of pieces missing.
---
My gamertag is:.  sleepy4792
---
Ya and adds a new revenue for Bethesda as they would probably have a lot of customer.
---
Any wood pile at houses or camp sites. Big logs in the woods. Smaller ones don't give wood. Scrapping guns will give wood. Sledge hammers also.
---
It's not a perfect solution but you could use the Class Freak perk to reduce all the negative effects up to 75%.
---
total reworking of the respec system, yes.
---
atomic shop micro transaction respec, no.
---
 
---
Honestly I prefer the way zenimax went about respecing in ESO, pay in-game money at a religious shrine to fully respec your points, etc. 
---
although they also added a micro transaction option, that‚Äôs just zenimax being themselves tho.
---
I doubt Bethesda would go about that route because of the backlash they already received from the repair kits alone.
---
It would be nice to see a cap sink in-game that would let you respec tho.
---
I already use it.
---
Claim workshops to farm Plans. You get plans after each "Defend your Workshop from Enemies" event. Hold 2 or 3 workshops and you can farm them quickly.
---
Xbox. Sorry
---
Noted thank you(:
---
Furious explosive gating would be nice.
---
Maybe with +10% damage while aiming
---
Bloodied agility faster movement speed 10mm smg.. or a combat knife w/ an faster swing speed bloodied and strength..
---
If only energy weapons were bettah :(
---
I'm going to West Virginia next month for a long weekend. So I was thinking about picking this game up ahead of the trip but I'm not sure it's worth it?
---
i think it could be a nice idea. i think if we buy something from a camp we could get some lottery tickets and at the end of the week they announce the winner
---
but the winner doesn't win caps(because that's the point of the tax)
---
the winner gets something like a legendary weapon, an item from the atom shop, atom points, a visit from the mothman, a gold watch, a trophy to put in their camp, a legendary chainsaw...
---
I find that the respect system works just fine. Unless your trying to be a. Member of the FLAVOROFTHEWEEK Club. Then nope it's not going to help at all.
---
  
---
It's designed for the casual gamer that plays a few hours a week. Yes it's trash from an MMO point of view. But since this isn't a gener6 MMO. It fight just fine.
---
Could it use some adjusents yes. Does it needs to be replaced, imo nope. I'm it does NOT need an atom shop cost either. Cap cost maybe . Ats nope
---
Can you get the .50 cal receivers for the hunting rifle just from scrapping other hunting rifles? Or do you need to buy them?
---
Xbox One X . Didn‚Äôt seem right to lay it any other way.
---
You are all awesome. I now realize I just don‚Äôt have the scrap I need. I feel so dumb. Lol. I totally thought we NEEDED the repair kits. I think it just tripped me out. All this new stuff is so weird. Baseball season hasn‚Äôt allowed me to do anything for myself with two kids playing.
---
At work but mine earlier said 1ap
---
On the Xbox, once at the relevant workbench it‚Äôs Y to preview the item followed by X (whilst still in the preview screen) to repair.
---
And figure out what kind of build you want now and put points into those perk cards that increase the weapon types damage early on as you level. Look up perk card loadouts specific to your desired build. I'm a semi Auto Rifle guy so I maxed out the 3 Rifle Man perk cards under Intelligence.
---
If I said I was in search of a legendary marine chest, all the gym rats would start flexing and posing...
---
I would like to be able to buy respec points for currency in game similar to script..
---
think.. a second kind of scrip used to buy "refund kits" that give you back a point or points
---
im not sure what would be a good mechanic for it..
---
Nope.  Stay out of my west tek runs please and thanks
---
Well looking at the picture, it looks like none of your stairs are connected to a foundation piece. I‚Äôd hazard a guess and say if you placed stairs connected to a foundation you‚Äôd be able to remove the rest of them. I‚Äôm surprised it actually let you delete it in the first place, because there is no way you placed floor tiles with out a foundation to start with.
---
are you on now? If so i‚Äôll add you in a bit and we can start earlier
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Agree
---
Sorry, I didn't see! I was on real quick after work but AFK a little bit while making dinner, must have missed you.
---
No prob. Some people don't get to play much. Hope you have success now. And hope the kids have fun
---
It‚Äôs been worth it since launch in my opinion, but it‚Äôs definitely more improved currently than it was back then. Lots of new content and overall improvements. Still lots of bugs but better
---
Has anyone seen the violent legendary or was that removed from this game?
---
Read through patch notes and Inside The Vault posts https://fallout.bethesda.net and decide for yourself.
---
Yeah, they're a nice little thing to have around for all of us high level players that run the high level events on a regular basis, but I really hate the new system. It was so nice being able to repair straight from the bench with two buttons. Now we need to go into the inspect menu for each individual weapon, click to repair it, confirm, back out of the menu, and repeat. All because maybe once every blue moon in a dungeon I'll want to use an improved repair kit from the scorchbeast queen because I don't feel like running over to the nearest workbench
---
You should get to pick the perk at level up time. If the information you have is correct.
---
Yea I think that is most likely thanks
---
It's a way to get you to buy atoms. Much easier to just pay for some instead of doing these dumb challenges.  Bethesda knows this.
---
Same problem. Even a floor section I put on the outside so I could install wiring wouldn't delete when I no longer needed it. Keeps saying part of the structure wouldn't be accessible. So I dropped a turent on it to make it look like it belongs there.
---
That seems to bypasses the crash. I‚Äôve done it a handful of times, only one crash in the middle of the boss fight. (PS4)
---
i dont know actually. i bought the plans from vendors.
---
Yes.  You will have fun.
---
I like the idea of a prestige, youd have to start over sure but you can build your character the right way and Bethesda could award a variety of perks for Prestiging: higher stash capacity, CAMP budget, special points capacity, +1* legendary items since 3/5 is highest available currently, etc
---
can you even get TSE *and* AA in the same roll?
---
Weak. Glad I decided not to purchase.
---
I have 4.. well 2 in stock, if you have stable violet Flux i can make the other 2. I usually do 350 a piece, but can go down to 250 if you have 2 of the flux?
---
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I'm on PC and can't help, but I managed to do this to a random in the arktos pharma event. Many of the biomes (by that I mean I think all three, not sure about B though) are composed mostly of water. The alpha boss is sure to knock out some people, usually the melee folks. It's a bit difficult to get people to die in the small puddle during the impostor sheepsquatch event, but here it's difficult for people to NOT die in the water
---
Do you have the materials?    If so I can convert them for you.
---
Oh man, the next time I run into a tool, I'm using that line. I'm sure it will induce pure rage. Heh
---
Nexus mods has what you want and more.
---
Kinda like that idea.
---
Another user showed me a very useful perk class builder that will help me out a lot I believe with this
---
I had some awesome friends come through for me and have all but chameleon back and think I'm bout to get that too.  But thank you.
---
Cool! Also on Xbox. My gt is my name here and I‚Äôm on most evenings (GMT). Give me a shout if you need a hand with anything dude. If you‚Äôre not aware of it, the filthy casuals group on here are a really friendly social bunch, it‚Äôs definitely worth checking them out.
---
2000 is even rounder.
---
No. It's terrible. Thank you for posting this question instead of using search.
---
Awesome! If not let me know, chameleon i actually do have in stock.
---
Quad Explosive or Mutants Instigating Black powder pistol.
---
Sure did.
---
Will do.
---
Anti-armor, rapid (+25% fire rate), rapid (+15% reload speed)
---
Sure didnt
---
Thanks for the info! Now this is useful
---
Yeah, I have GB Internet as well. Since I posted earlier, I got into one but we failed, then I went back into it and it sent me straight to the dashboard.
---
you had me in the first sentence.
---
Perception adds to the distance you spot enemies and their red dot shows on the HUD.
---
They can be avoided. Crouch behind certain obstacles confuses them. They just stand there being shot. Eventually running away.
---
You made a lengthy post sniveling about losing a pvp encounter and I said join the scouts. What's the confusion?
---
Nah, man. I really don‚Äôt care that this post was deleted. 350 up votes over 8 hours isn‚Äôt exactly ‚Äúviral‚Äù by any means. It would have faded to obscurity soon anyways, if it wasn‚Äôt already dead in the water.
---
What took me aback was that I learned it was deleted in the same system message notifying me that someone commented, [‚ÄúAnd this is why I love the Fallout community‚Äù.](https://twitter.com/idmachina/status/1131349892121669645?s=21) 
---
Just seems odd to remove a post the majority of folks are enjoying on the arbitrary grounds that people won‚Äôt enjoy it. 
---
As I said in the initial post, the rule doesn‚Äôt remove unwanted posts. It only serves to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù the community from content they‚Äôre already enjoying. In such I think the rule is worth revisiting.
---
ahhh I remember when it was 200
---
Also, if it's the same as F4, then all V.A.T.S shots are considered fully charged. With all the other instances I can't see why that feature wouldn't have crossed over to 76!
---
Someone had the mod for 25 caps at their CAMP...
---
Bought that sonofabitch so fast it made my head spin
---
Didn‚Äôt it start at 400?
---
Will do indeed thanks friend GT is the same on here too. My availability will wary but I‚Äôll hyu if ever the need arises
---
No confusion. You Didn't read it, or you didn't understand it.
---
You could be correct, I don‚Äôt remember, all I remember was it was super low and I threw out a ton of my junk lol
---
You can't "save up" levels. You have to pick a perk for level 9 before the level 10 perks become available.
---
It‚Äôs funny for a joke or two, but the meat of Rule 6 (in my personal opinion) is to help alleviate how useless the search function on reddit is. 
---
Say you see a really good thread that is specific to a problem that you‚Äôre having, and you forget to upvote or save it. Now attempt to search for it.
---
‚ÄúHas anyone else had this problem?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThis is stupid.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúWhy does this happen to me?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNew bug.‚Äù
---
You‚Äôll probably never find it again. We can have a discussion about it, but you should know where we‚Äôre coming from.
---
Kings Hawaiian rolls perhaps
---
Ow well, at least I got to see the place.
---
Ya either way it definitely something they need to add, hopefully they add something with the Prestige system that decent. Even a 10k or 25k serum would be great.
---
I have one in my machine wait till it shows you the value of it there its great
---
My experience was if I was alone at the location I could use the elevator, if there was anyone else it crashed. Once someone managed to go in and start the even you could fast travel inside the event without trouble. Did it a dozen time today.
---
The best part of this now is that you can rename the chassis frames so you can tell which one has the T60, which one is Excavator, etc. Before the rename it was a pain in the butt having to pull out all the frames to work out which one had the armor on it you wanted to use.
---
I just realised if I give my gun to you , you might just walk off with it haha
---
I have not, but it seems to be fairly desirable with quad-explosive effects given harpoon ammo can be recovered.
---
Can you imagine a crowd of 300,000 legendary glowing ones smiling at you.
---
One of them will be your dream god roll now go find himü§©
---
I think they should allow random people to help contribute to the game. Maybe give them a free copy of Starfield or something. Make it semi open source. Modders mostly do mods for free right?
---
It really makes the game feel like it was designed as a free-to-play game, but then they scrapped that idea right at the last minute and tried to make something like Fortnite crossed with Borderlands.
---
It's certainly an odd feeling to play this game.
---
It's subjective. There are still bugs and issues but it's incrementally better. I felt as there was never a shortage of things to do; workshops, power plant repairs, hordes, many locations has it's own repeatable event and that's on top of quests and side missions yet many say there isn't much. (I feel many of them rushed the story, grinded for top tier loot and now don't know what to do. To be fair there isn't much to do at that level except to wait for the fourth star to be implemented on gear.)
---
Now is a good time. With project paradise the community is working together again, however these updates have a short shelf life. Soon unless paradise is different, it'll be a ghost town but if you join it should rank you up quick. You will die a lot as a new character (any character without top gear will no matter the level)
---
Perfect :)
---
I've seen a player vendor shop way up north west across the river where you should not be able to access or set up a CAMP. Fast travelled there to see what was going on only to appear near Flatwoods. Like the mystery nuke zone at the lumber mill, this was the map being populated incorrectly.  Not saying this is why happened, but don't trust the map when something unusual is shown on it.
---
Maxing stats, stacking buffs, and using God roll weapons doesn't make someone good at pvp. Quite the opposite, actually. I'll have some of your idea, please. I hate mutations, marsupial the most . I'd love to blast me some muties in pvp.
---
Thank you.
---
Okay cool, thank you!
---
Thanks.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks the ammo is a tad heavy. I've written off a Bloodied Gauss on account of it, well that and I can't craft a suppressor. It's counted as energy ammo, isn't it? With that weight, it had better be! It's clearly ballistic ammo, but whatever!
---
Quite rare is an understatement it‚Äôs more accurate to say 1/1000 chance at least for me
---
Giant praying mantis.
---
Thanks
---
I had a 12 year old that stalked me asking me for stuff. I tried to be nice but I eventually had to block him
---
I didn't know you could do that, thanks!
---
Use the inspect option while viewing it in your inventory and then it will give you the option to rename.
---
Well dammit... that solves my problem lol
---
My (trapper) armor is also showing over my outfit, was hoping this would be fixed in the 9.5 patch, but unfortunately it hasn‚Äôt been. Any information into the fix on this. (Also, this is on ps4) if that helps. Huge disappointment for me.
---
Welcome to the party dude...
---
And everybody on xb1 regretted that move when app crashes.  Lesson learned the hard way. Lost my X01 jetpack plan that way. Still haven‚Äôt been able to get it back.
---
I also have one of these!
---
I used the LMG once and was out of ammo before I knew it. Kinda turned me off lol
---
Boils down to ammo longevity between those two weapons and how you want to farm ammunition mats. (Or just straight buy and not care about crafting it)
---
Ammosmith gives you 180 rounds of 50 vs 21 rounds of 308 or 86 rounds of ultracite 308. You'll use far more materials to craft 180 rounds of normal 308 versus 50. The mats:rounds surpasses 50 with ultracite 308, but now you're farming fluorescent fluxes to craft it.
---
As for what you're experiencing between the LMG and the TS 50... faster time to kill is faster time to kill. That is why I use a TS auto grenade launcher to erase lightly armored enemies instead of my AA gatling or TS 50.
---
Bearclaw
---
It‚Äôs also got a weird swirling green effect when you highlight it, at least in the vending machine. You can acquire these by being hit by Snallygaster spit. When I saw this in a player vending machine I went on a Snally hunt. I experimented with hitting various buttons as I was being hit to ‚Äúcollect‚Äù them and I‚Äôm not sure if that helped but after about 30 seconds I had 14 of them in my inventory!
---
Duecehead
---
I got 1 salt for sell at 10,000 caps.
---
This reminds me of one time I was trying to take down the SBQ. The queen got to about half of her second health bar and all of the sudden I hear this squeaky 10 year old voice singing over area chat. They stopped for like, a minute then started back up again the rest of the fight. I would of muted them but if I stood still for more that a few seconds my health would get rammed.
---
Its a common occurrence. The work around is FT to Gauley mine and walk there or FT away, enter a building and then FT to Arktos. 
---
I think. 
---
Trying to recollect from earlier posts.
---
A few patches ago there were eight things that could be bulked to reduce weight. Don't know why they changed it.
---
But 8 is my favorite number so I prefer 800
---
I always pick 2 star ranged weapons as I don‚Äôt think the 3rd star is ever worth the value of another good 2 star weapon.
---
Actually 1024 is a nice round number for computer databases. You know, to make things easier for Bethesda‚Äôs programmers. üòâ
---
In addition to what RuneOption said, luck also contributes to filling your critical meter faster (note: you can only crit using vats). Perception contributes to weapon accuracy in vats and the distance at which you can see things on your compass.
---
Compared to a good rolled legendary weapon it‚Äôs bad. But I know what you mean it‚Äôs still like 200 damage upgraded with mods &amp; perks.
---
im trying that asap thx person!
---
It is kinda hard getting all 3 friendly creatures to stay alive the whole time.  Especially when the alpha boss usually one taps them.
---
thats about as graphic as star wars you baby.
---
Hey, if we‚Äôre wishing for stuff, how about take that 200 lbs of storage but put it in a shared stash that our alt characters can get into? I can‚Äôt be the only one that finds *exactly* what our other character needs with no real easy way of getting it there.
---
And of course if you don‚Äôt have that need, just dump your absurdly heavy gear in there for overflow storage.
---
I got invisible enemies in the ground myself and unkillable ones as well also some vats seems more wonky then usual
---
Looking for TSE weapons,  and nice melee items,  axes or hammers mainly
---
After logging in to any of my characters I have to wait anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes for my camp to fully load in. It seems to load in faster if I turn off the radio in my pip-boy but I have to do more testing to say this for sure.
---
I had no idea food spoiled and after a while I had a bunch of rotten food/drink in my inventory. So sad. 
---
Another thing I thought of: scrap your junk at the tinkers workbench. Ends up weighing less :)
---
you can't mark junk as favorite......
---
I thought of, what I think, is kind of unique compromise for the the storage issue:
---
Make different kinds of boxes only able to store certain items. 
---
-Ammo cannisters for, well, ammo,
---
-Coolers and fridges for food.
---
-dressers for cloths/armor
---
-footlockers for weapons
---
Etc,
---
Allows Bethesda to lower the max inventory space of each box, but still technically gives us players a bit more total space.
---
IDK, what does everyone else think? If you don't think that's a good idea, I'd love to hear why.
---
I had small letter plan. As well I had labels that helped as well.
---
yes please .. it's most online games they have this because each character is in an endless loop to aquire more levels/gear etc esp in a suvival game like this with plans/recipes/legendaries etc that are not account bound .. ultimately player retention will suffer if no full respec option becomes available ..
---
Only use I know is to scrap for cloth
---
Or for scripts
---
I don't do a lot of legendary weapons, put I did put up a bunch of the melee weapons for the weekly challenge. If it's something I can craft, odds are if you just send me a message, I can make it and give you it for free.
---
Been noticing the in ground enemies as well. Seems that sometimes plasma grenades work on them, but I‚Äôve also found ones that it won‚Äôt.
---
You never had one on Fallout 4?
---
So stupid question amongst all this.   Can I just join randoms like the other events in game?   Cause my mates aren't on all the time and I wasn't sure if it was private party or not. 
---
This probably answers the question about server notifications because until now I didn't you could just randomly join (if that is possible)
---
Hey I just also realized I don‚Äôt use power armor or fusion cores could y‚Äôall think of a alternative to the power user perk
---
How much and what level?
---
From data-mining, the action point cost of the base handmade and combat rifles is 32 and 25 respectively. I haven't confirmed whether this number is actually used though.
---
Some mods also change AP cost directly. Full armor piercing mags add 20%, while half armor piercing adds 10%. High capacity mags add 5 or 10% depending on the size. Reflex sights reduce AP cost by 15%, while glow sights reduce it by 7.5%.
---
Gas Mask and Skeleton Mask worked.  And you could use the big statue or the little one in the museum/shop.
---
In f4 I got a laser rifle w/ the ice legendary effect changed it to blue laser and called it Kold Kut!!
---
Also a bloodied stregth war drum called
---
Rust Bucket.
---
What?
---
#Bearclaw
---
I have 10 full sets of PA and have not experienced any of what  you described on your comment.
---
Which mods did you use?
---
I honestly really like this idea.  Gives us the ability to be a bit more organized and have added stash space.   And I‚Äôd love if the fridge extended shelf life of expirables.
---
I see well I use my t51b the most and have Black Rider on it.
---
I don't think so but wouldn't that be awesome?
---
Play the game. Shut up.
---
@lamarcs that‚Äôs fair and is admittedly something I had not considered. I‚Äôm a relative newb when it comes to Reddit, so please take my suggestions with a grain of salt. 
---
To be clear, I appreciate what the mods are doing and don‚Äôt begrudge anyone for deleting the post.
---
But with that said, the way that all played out didn‚Äôt seem like it was inspirit with the intended purpose of the rules.
---
I think we can all agree that this sub is as much a community hub as it is a free form strategy guide and QA tool for the devs. Enforcing the same ironclad rules for every type of post feels a little heavy handed.
---
Besides beating up the word "literally" it's a pretty cool story. +1

- these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head
---
The shredder mod is a melee weapon, basically a bayonet. It does not affect damage.
---
Ok now ya lost me again.
---
Maybe theyre a sunset sasparilla fan?
---
Facetank?  Love the word.  Have no idea what it means.
---
Lol fuck me right... just dropping by the sub to see if the game has any long term playerbase as I was considering buying it after 160 hours of division 2.
---
Maybe you guys should sticky something if that many people are coming through looking to see if its viable game.
---
If that made it more likely, happy to *compromise* to 1024.
---
I'm level 64 and never even held an explosive ballistic gun in the game yet. I just want one even if it's shitty so I can spend some running around with an explosive pew üòÇ like everyone else I see in the game
---
No worries, I shouldn‚Äôt be too much longer maybe another hour or so
---
Alright! Imma be grinding at the new dungeon, so whenever you‚Äôre on you can join!
---
I love sneaking around west Tek with the stuff on and the muties don't bat an eye when there's a tree shuffling around the halls.
---
you are amazing. thank you so much!!!!!!!!
---
An annoyance? Perhaps. A bug? No. Need to be "fixed"? No. I manage by, managing?
---
I use all those except slugger and bloody mess, I don‚Äôt really understand the bloody mess description though does it mean I‚Äôll do 15% more damage sometimes ?
---
I scrape for screws daily.
---
Picture a Deathclaw swinging at you.  Instead of dodging or blocking, you see someone let it gently caress their face (seriously maim them) and act like it won't kill them.  Then it does anyway.  That's facetanking.
---
Yes. Only bulk steel lead an aluminum
---
Last i checked only useful if you're trying to sell. Otherwise you don't save any weight and waste the plastic used to bulk.
---
 Assuming bethesda hasn't changed anything, the only items that benefit from bulking are aluminum and lead, those should save you weight when bulked.
---
The shredder counts as bashing. I believe it gains damage from the bashing mod, and it benefits from the +40% bashing damage legendary mod. So no, it won't blow up in your face unless you're shooting bullets as well. The shredder just damages anything near you while you're spinning up your minigun. You can empty out the clip and keep "shooting", and then use a regular bash attack to cancel the reload and start "shooting" again to use it as a chainsaw. Alternatively, just stash/drop all your 5mm and it will still let you "shoot" it
---
Incisor.  Blocker. Serendipity.  Five points in luck to run mutations.   Adrenal reaction serum.  Unyielding armor.
---
Unless the weapon has +40 bash damage
---
In the vast majority of cases yes.  I believe only aluminum and lead are net less than the scrap that goes into their bulk.
---
That doesn't always work. My latest build wouldn't allow that. Something they did in patch 9 screwed things up.
---
No. AA and TS are both on the first affix. You can get TSE or AAE.
---
That's kind of you. I can craft most,  I'm primarily after legendaries,  heavy effects,  that sort of thing
---
IIRC none of the energy weapon mods add the WeaponTypeShotgun keyword, so they wouldn't benefit from shotgun perks. Laser and plasma guns are either WeaponTypePistol or WeaponTypeRifle, depending entirely on the stock.
---
Perfect explanation.  Thank you.
---
I have max strength and I‚Äôm running max strong back, all the gladiators max wand martial artist 2* I‚Äôm thinking that strong back isn‚Äôt necessary so should I replace incisor with it ?
---
This game crashed 10 minutes after I made this post. I wish I was making this shit up.
---
So apparently Project Paradise is no joke?
---
You have to buy them.
---
Oh - that's the secret to minigun bashing?  Thanks!
---
you (((people))) will never have enough stash space. they could increase it to 10,000 TOMORROW and you'd complain.
---
For science
---
Once you do Project Paradise you'll understand.
---
the +15% damage is a static +15% damage bonus to ALL attacks
---
Most of them weigh the exact same, minus the 2 plastic you used to bulk it. Only lead and aluminum weigh less when bulked. I think only one or two resources actually weigh more
---
I saw another player go down to a sheep squat hunt and hauled ass to get to him, getting slapped around by a Yao Guai the whole time, but he must‚Äôve hit respawn because I couldn‚Äôt revive him. 
---
Selfish bastard.
---
The gatling gun sights are screwed up again, and I've noticed the "delay" is back when removing and replacing mainframe cores in the silos.
---
They actually upped the damage on all of the 50cal receivers in the same patch. Standard was higher than Refined before the patch, but because you could rarely find the plans, few people noticed.
---
I wouldn't shout about it if I were you, because the likely "fix" would nerf the standard 50cal receiver.
---
Who YOU callin ‚Äúyou people‚Äù?!
---
They are amateurs. This game is proof. They cannot release a patch without re-introducing bugs or breaking something. I wonder if they have the sense to test it before release. It sure doesn't look like it.
---
And the occasional joy of turning your target into giblets.
---
I found it rather difficult; but I also don't have a loadout for it since I'm a stealth sniper and my damage is reduced drastically because when something is in combat it won't take sneak attack damage.
---
I really like the concept of the event and the design of the biome lab, and overall the execution, apart from the crashes and lag, is pretty good. The issue with this event is sadly the same one with Encrypted where it seems most of the player base cannot do any amount of cooperation beyond killing shit. I've attempted the event 5 times, 4 of those times I was the only one putting things in the feeder, and lo and behold, we failed every attempt. I'm happy this event isn't mindless, I just wish people were better at following directions.
---
I tend to roll solo. Any chance of beating this solo without being a god tier, epic bloodied build?
---
Mine didn‚Äôt!
---
It's a scrap mod with a decent chance to unlock, so if you have the plan then you can just craft a few of them.

Why not? Someone nuked the arkos pharma lst night
---

---
Man, i've gotten two gold rolls from this so far.
---
It always does. The last 3 I've bought have automatically become the default until I change them.
---
I notice it switched mine earlier too (PS4)
---
or could make it so that you don't have to be over level 50 in order to play :/
---
Not done the new event yet but not had any of those other problems
---
Wood comes from fallen logs quite easily, as well as from scrapping a lot of weapons and other junk.
---
But there's no other second slot roll that will boost damage besides explosive. All the vats shit is useless with heavy weapons, and fire rate does improve dps, but damage per round remains unaffected.
---
Now I'm stocking nothing but level 1 pipe rifles.
---
I do not have the plan. And I have scrapped to plasma gatling's and the only thing that opened up was the site. The second scrap did nothing.
---
I want a ZZ Top beard option.  Along with the ability to play "La Grange" on the guitar on my porch.  ü§†
---
I'm only rolling 3 star weapons. But that's only because I had 1\* bloodied handmade and combat shotgun before this launched. I already had really decent damage output guns.   
---
You can get 1 3 star weapon one day, 2 the next, and that's the most reliable drop rate in the game, if I'm going to be honest.
---
Weeeell it's already in the road map (legendary players this summer)
---
You can join randoms. All you have to do is go to the event when it‚Äôs started.
---
When I needed to nuke something that wasn‚Äôt a fissure site for the last overseer tape I decided on Charleston because curiosity they probably had the same reason
---
It requires a very specific blood ritual beforehand.
---
For giggles? üëâüö®üí•üî•üòÄ
---
Same...
---
tl:dr griefing was successful
---
Where is that area located on the map?
---
Had just the same Issue. Tried to buy a few less from his total Screws and it worked. Did this until he had just a few left.
---
Okay. So looks like someone beat me to it thankfully so they posted it here

Any perks equipped?

Oh that's good to know does it show up on map like event started or something?
---
The encrypted event. Players go down during that event. Carpe diem.
---
I agree totally. I have everything in my vender machine for under 20caps. I think vending machines should be more for helping people rather than trying to make lots of caps.
---
Just got all the mutations I wanted, I don‚Äôt know how I even played before lol
---
Sorry I got carried away playing state of decay haha, are you still on? I'll join you if you are
---
Why would you buy a two star?
---
Probably because the servers are rebooted once a week.
---
Right now, I can sell my serums for 500 to a vendor. If I sell them for less than that to players, then I'm losing caps, so 500 is what I'm asking for. People who sell them for 200 are basically giving away free caps, and I usually buy those and then turn around and sell them for caps. Free money!
---
Instigating Explosive Lever Action w/ a VATS perk.
---
Yea starting new characters always makes me wanna cry.  Can't jump, don't auto heal, can't fall off cliffs, I hate it.
---
Uhh no. Sorry. But each to their own. I max out in caps at least twice a week. Let me build my character with top notch gear and weapons.
---
Sorry all full rifleman. I think that it that directly affects rifle dmg.
---
Same with Xbox, luckily I found a guy who had all of them for 200. Try asking on the market pages for big traders who has them, some might even be willing to negotiate
---
I want to clarify that it‚Äôs not always like that! Definitely was a first for me having that many issues so quick. 
---
What I was more curious about is that some of these were supposed to be fixed in past patches.
---
You're dropping one of the most expensive types of ammo on the shelf. Lol.
---
Elaborate?
---
I've done it like 3 or 4 times.  I think you probably CAN finish it solo.  I usually do the first half solo in one of the rooms.  The boss is tough though.  Level 100 alpha sheepsquatch, grafton monster or fog crawler.
---
It can be anyone. For a solo player there are a few option. For me, I kept an eye out for a bounty to appear on the map. I then killed them and stimpacked them. Another option is to ask for someone to die for you on here. Or go to an event like Arkos or the Sheepsquach events where people are likely to get knocked. Those are the easiest three options. The other is just to roam around and wait for the opportunity by chance.
---
If they've already emptied the 1400 from their vendors for the day then they're still making profit.
---
It was mainly the jump that kills me, it goes from halo to call of duty lol
---
Wait really? I thought it was too far in the Forest‚Äôs safe zone.
---
Yes. Thanks üòä
---
Lol i got it.
---
Don't store them, otherwise you cannot replace them
---
It's a 20% chance per scrap so you'll probably need more than two.
---
Not being able to jump over a knee height fence is just depressing.
---
Thats the bitch about the legendary loot pool. So much intentional crap. I read a guys post where he gave suggestions on like 5-10 new legendary effects and they were awesome, but not OP. We're all chasing the same stuff in the markets because its just objectively better than most of the stuff we get from drops.
---
Sunset sasparilla is the soda in fallout new Vegas made on the west coast and was nuka colas direct competition. Fallout joke.
---
Meant to reply with that earlier :) hope things still look good in spite of that
---
It does actually, with biome c. You harvest kelp and green thumb doubles the amount. I assume butchers bounty would help with venison as well
---
Third effects suck. This way you can roll twice as many. Idc for +1 agility or damage resist while aiming.
---
Sadly no!
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten there so didn‚Äôt know you‚Äôd nuke anything other than tinget flux, kill the queen, or farm ghouls.
---
Some people on my friends list stepped up and took care of me.  I have everything back now.
---
Xbox one here no problems so far but hey, Welcome to BGS.
---
Because the atom shop is on a "timer" in that it's already set up in advance when things show up for sale
---
I too would like to know how to trigger this event.
---
Sorry bro, was just trying to help you out in case you hadn't completed the "revive an ally" quest, wish I had a mic so I could have told you.
---
But if your looking to sell high cap value equipment or other collectibles, the market forums is a much better resource. 
---
Camp vending player either take the time to walk/run to it or pay caps to fast travel. Either way it sucks to waste time or caps just to see mutt chop recipes for 200caps. üòì

Some servers are more likely to give out the same  main perk, last night I got a robot, marine &amp; steel weightless piece. 
---
The night before I got 2 prisoners.
---
If you are looking for a specific main perk (unyielding etc) it may pay to save up &amp; find a server that gives you that wanted perk the first go, then try again, 
---
If it still rewards the required perk, but wrong armor/weapon type - just keep trying on that server.
---
May be worth a try, what I'm thinking of doing
---
I love it!
---
You can fast travel to the same camp. Since it's loaded you won't be stuck.
---
Depends on your build. Better safe than sorry.
---
For Bloody, 11 Points in luck for Starched Genes, Bloody Mess, Class Freak, Serendipity
---
That's very altruistic of you. I'd rather make caps I'm trying to get more Mutation Serums.
---
You mean I'm not supposed to be able to respect on the whim in case I run into dense-fireproof counter build and my TSE is useless? You mean I ACTUALLY have to put thoughts and commitment to my builds and accept risks of counters instead of being able to conveniently change to the easy win build at any moment? 
---
I am shocked!
---
/s obviously

No you have to fast travel out then back to the camp since you're to close game wont allow you
---
Ok thanks.  I'll try my luck at an event tomorrow.  I didn't think of that.  Thanks again
---
I just tried using a Cultist Dagger and it didn't count üò¢üò≠üò≠
---
I just messaged them and they came back to help.  But ill give this a shot next time
---
Drink one of the Nuka flavors for -rads, or Brahmin Milk (x lots).
---
(i think grape is -rads nuka?)
---
Yes! I know exactly the place you‚Äôre talking about! It‚Äôs toward the south end right on the cranberry bog border! There‚Äôs also sometimes a death claw that gets in there for a DP of awesomeness.
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
Now coming! Look out for 'I Squanch Daily'. I'll go to your camp as mine doesnt have workbenches
---
&gt;Because I'm RPing Brotherhood of Steel
---
&gt;Ad Victorium
---
You must be one of those new east coast recruits, because *that* is not our call. It's Ad VictoriAm; get it right, initiate. Now get me 200 ghoul heads to atone for this transgression.
---
Dismissed!
---
[PS4] every icon I've purchased has done this
---
Change spawn places.. - randomize  
---
Shared loot via chest or direct  
---
Event duration and time played should be used to give loot to participants.. not just the level 225 that drops in for a 1/2 shot kill of that one legendary....  
---
"Boss" lootable for all players in event that played it for say.. 75 / 80 percent
---
why was this not fixed in any of last few patches?
---
That sucks. Seriously. It's a knife
---
Executioner's is +dmg for people less than 40% health, is already perfect counter for Bloodied.
---
Okay my camp is right near White springs it's a store.
---
wow im jealous of all that violet
---
I have a TSE handmade if you‚Äôre on Xbox
---
Would I want Unyielding Sent or Cav? I think Cav would be better but everyone tells me Sent
---
I can make your missing parts. On PC. RB1955. Will be on at 3sm EST and again around noon every day.
---
I'm starting to believe the theory of it being based on a seed related to your character and the server. 3 of the first 5 guns I bought on day 1 were explosive, and the rest had +10% damage while aiming. That's all I've been finding in the past few weeks
---
Yyyyyeeeeeessss!!!!!!!!
---
Yea feature wise the Legendaries definitely aren‚Äôt balanced. That‚Äôs why everyone wants the same thing. Assassins only give you 10% buff, when players are wearing the best magic armors in the game. People dump assassins stuff at vendors as soon as they pick them up. Make it a 50% buff people will dump their TSE for Assassins Explosive. It‚Äôs probably not intentional crap, but there‚Äôs only so many legendary effects they could come up with.
---
A bloodied bp pistol? As if bloodied wasnt risky enough. Better nor miss...
---
Don‚Äôt fast travel just run
---
So this exact thing is the exact thing that happened to me yesterday. I‚Äôve tried to take the elevator down 6 times after I couldn‚Äôt respawn and it crashes every single time. So, I join on the actual event and it spawns you in the basement. I‚Äôve only done it two times and it‚Äôs worked that way so I‚Äôll have to test it more to verify. Also I died a couple more times (didn‚Äôt care since I lost a shit load of junk already) and it respawn Ed me in the basement. Hope that maybe helps.
---
i got a blue screen, i dont recall ever getting that on any xbox game ever!
---
Yeah I noticed something similar, I got 3 Regenerating in a row.
---
You know... you right
---
hmm might be my pc then. or maybe the server just crashed and it was unrelated to anything I was doing. Regardless I am modifying my dream of the ultimate garage into a few set of L15 raider sets and maybe t51b nuka and x-01 quantam pieces on my shop.
---
True that!
---
Thanks (at least I‚Äôll take it as a compliment) The one thing I wanted from all the fallout games was to actually do something to help another player not just run errands for npc‚Äôs. 
---
Just trying to make the wasteland a little nicer place to call home. üòÅ
---
Lol this is pretty damn funny!
---
It will only respawn you in the basement while the event is active. Once it times out you‚Äôll be back spawning outside
---
Openly acknowledging you are an absolute coward, exactly the level of awareness I expect from the complete failures that are the "Raiders" of Appalachia.
---
That‚Äôs what most people do but I already knew what happened at whitesprings curiosity got the better of me these days I exclusively launch at prime
---
Yea I just meant for you trying to do the event in the future.
---
Yea the funny thing is they get more negatives than positives instead of getting a couple of great ones for your build and leave all the useless ones behind
---
this occurs on occasion with the large bosses (some may say "often")  
---
last time i did the SBQ I hit her with 40 M79 40mm grenades and idk how many shotshells and got nothing- no even meat
---
Really? I find them everywhere now, I must have a stack of 20-30 in my miscellaneous inventory by now, can't do anything with the extras, wish I could sell them.
---
I‚Äôd love this
---
Tried that with the wife. Got neither a good weapon nor armor in return.
---
Hell yes. I started the event today, and nobody came. Failed.
---
Just stating a fact it is a kind thing to do
---
Rifle gaming did a video on nuking the campfire tales event. Apparently it‚Äôs lousy with unique materials because of all the insects that show up and the nuka cola plant was a nice side effect with all the glowing ones
---
Yeah how do people do this? Because I saw a guy who had a tamed mirelurk king at the white spring.  I haven‚Äôt tamed any animals but my camp is on a 100% Brahmin spawn so I kind of have tamed animals but not really?
---
Omg thank you so much for this, I always use the mole rat 'cos it looks derpy as hell hahaha.
---
Now do content drops like this every month please
---
Wolf's spawn pretty much 100% of the time southeast of the Charleston fire station on the side of the hill/mountain where it changes from the Forest to the Ash heap.
---
I M M E D I A T E L Y  O R  E L S E
---
OR ELSE I WILL TAKE MY FOOD BUILD TO THE STREETS OF BETHESDA
---
some people need junk gear...
---
Yeah, so now I gotta server hop so wolves will spawn where I know they do 100% of the time.
---
Thanks. Do you know which ingame vendors sell them?
---
Nope, PS4
---
Instigating 10% aim reduced weight imo would be better.
---
Mothman mascot is datamined already
---
Yeah I know
---
Im an absolute coward, but I'll 1v1 or solo teams anyday. 
---
But yes I've tested ways to get people into combat since majority of people are cowards themselves and won't engage unless the situation seems perfect for them(ex. A lower level, which means an easy kill) 
---
I openly acknowledge I'm a menace to the wasteland and I love every minute of it, I'm here to destroy Appalachia not rebuild it.
---
Time to look for a new wife. That ones defective
---
Server hop near random event areas and tame them, it works kind of like the pacify feature. It's a huge pain, sometimes you can swap servers 10 times and not get a single tameable animal spawn.
---
Or transfer caps to another toon
---
Hopefully my dream comes with a quad tesla or a twoshot Fatman with fast reload.
---
so, 
---
i'll play
---
how does my death successfully complete my quest to revive an ally, WHEN IM DEAD, and i can't revive myself or anyone  else?....lolz
---
unless YOU were volunteering to be the intended rescue for me to complete? 
---
if so, then yeah get a mic.
---
I‚Äôm sick of going to someone‚Äôs camp with 20 weapons and not one of them is legendary!
---
Shows up as a standard event. Thing is, you are against a timer so that‚Äôs why being quick is important.
---
Why can‚Äôt these updates be tested beforehand?
---
Yea I saw it too but the event was finished already! I want some feed back to see how it effects the event!
---
It didn't trigger per se, but it did become available on the map twice in 30 minutes.
---
I want log cabin walls.
---
TS limb damage reduced weight grenade machinegun. Would be great for crowd control. Also TS grenade rifle DOES double its damage, so i hope it would for the auto.
---
PER helps with vats
---
server hoppers are not great for stability on xbox.. would love them to just make it a starter for new players... or a few more spawned on every server... I try for others to find one... so to help eachother.. but I have not found one in weeks...
---
That would require Bethesda to understand fun.
---
One man's 'crap' is another man's treasure.  
---
You don't speak for 'everyone' so you can't say " NOBODY WANTS YOUR GARBAGE."    
---
So many want to be Fallout millionaires and even some want to brag about it IRL which is hilarious.
---
Damn
---
Always have been
---
"Dew it."  - Emporer Palpatine
---
Strange? I have done it several times. Maybe I just have a badass PC. Lol. I have noticed you have to position the mouse just right to get it to come up.
---
Unyielding regardless. Imo (I don‚Äôt run it myself) cav would be better for melee so you can rush enemies vs just standing still. Specially with something one handed or a gauntlet.
---
I had good luck with the sleeping Yao Guai den in southern white springs, indeed hidden inside large cluster of rocks on the course equidistant between miners memorial &amp; snake on map. Helps to spec out a few nearby structures you can hop up on top of - also easy to sneak up on, set mines outside, chuck in a grenade to soften him up - as long as your syringer does the final damage, hit him with anything else first. we had a cartoonishly hilarious episode with this insanely pissed off bear chasing us around while my bleedout syringer took its slow toll... also - if you can craft syringers, or buy recipe cheaply - make a few to immediately break down to possibly unlock a variety of potent barrel mods. Off to take my last two quizzes for athletics, hunter, already did archery.... Opposum, here I come... right after I turn my parents in to the robot scout leaders for being secret commie spies from Mama Dolce‚Äôs. You know they got a secret commie spy base under there. Damn I want that tinfoil suit costume.
---
My Teddy Bear shop is doing quite well today. üêª
---
The recipe used to drop from sbq. Because of this some players achievEd all recipes. Totally legit. Additionally, the serums are cheap to make.
---
Mostly true, i believe there's a chem that let's you crit outside of vats, I wanna say overdrive?
---
There are a lot of good 2* weapons. There are a LOT MORE 3* weapons with one crappy star.
---
TS fat man: The Eraser
---
TSE minigun: Old Reliable
---
Anti armor SS Pickaxe: Miners Miracle
---
Personally I'd prefer an anti-armor exploive lever action, but I wouldn't turn that down in the meantime.  üòâ
---
7-10=70% not 90%.
---
Everyone has the right to sell what they want for what they want to sell it.  
---
You're just mad because you are looking for some rare, high end item and no one is selling it for what you want to pay, or in a forum you want to find it (a vending machine).
---
The game is what it is .... 9/10ths of us never get what we want.  Suck it up.
---
Fair point.
---
Probably not duper, i have 3-5 of almost all of them in my shop for 200c each. Late game its fairly easy to get the materials to make them, super duper is a savior also
---
Ok, hasn‚Äôt happened to me before. Thanks.
---
Hit me up sometime. I'm not usually doing anything important. Same name, lv 161.
---
Thanks for this, great guide and tips.
---
was this mosstown, or farther south?
---
i used to grind that place awhile back foe ultracite. actually any fissure site works.
---
If on ps4 I am a big trader
---
Yeah, baiting people with useless items is really inconsiderate.
---
They were for me at least. It is rather odd how wildly different people's experiences are.
---
I stopped by a players shop and he had like five 2* weapons selling for 9999c. I laughed and walked back out.
---
Nope still valid. Didn't participate in event but did kill some ghouls
---
I saw someone sell it for 16k the other day!!! Wtf!?
---
He means that 90% of the time when he tries to fast travel he has to try over again 7-10 times. This isn't rocket science.
---
You have to get 5/5 on every exam üò©
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I was thinking, I currently have a 1 star unyielding BOS Combat Armor Set
---
I have the one star version of both, quad tesla on auto is such a joy to shoot. Would be even nicer with faster fire. Fatman not sure, still waiting for a buff for the heavy explosives
---
Let's not forget being able to bulk ammo so we can sell it to peeps cheaper than 1 cap per round.
---
Went in after a nuke on Arkos and the event fired. Nothing really different was noticed. No glowing ones, no radiation, no change in the event.
---
i think you mean,
---
DO IT TO THEM, before they do it to you..
---
Definitely legit. Not everthing in this game is product of dup.
---
Recipes used to drop from SBQ a few months back. I myself didn't beat the sbq until after they stopped dropping. Yet I've been able to buy most every recipe and produce 10+ serums of each kind. Its actually not that hard.
---
Why would you say it's duped?
---
Yup, I passed all of them with the 5/5 and it doesn't count yet
---
Dank*
---
I don't have adrenaline perk, I have 2 star bloody mess, but I don't remove it and I have no mutations
---
This can‚Äôt be upvoted enough.  People run nuked WS for XP or legendaries?  Hell no, I go there for stabilizers!
---
It's a gag feature that was never even officially advertised. Sure, it would make money if it's a full feature but does beth want to allocate massive resource for basically a petting game? I don't think so.  But maybe in the future.
---
I have all but a few serum recipes you get them for 17500 caps t the enclave. I sell mine for 300 and normally I max it in caps every few days which I use to buy more recipes. The crafting materials are super cheap only one ultracite one flux and usually like five plastic or acid or oil or whatever. This is definitely not a duper. Dupers wouldn‚Äôt waste time with petty serums.
---
There is tons of it scattered around. The highest density for violet is the puddles near the substation and along the river between Harper's and the red rocket.
---
How did u guys build the habitat? I tried before and it wouldn‚Äôt let me.
---
Its just really rare. More common on higher level ones, but still like 5% or less droprate
---
Clean white walls would be great!
---
Yea, getting tired of them. Even the weeklies for The Mire and Ash Heap this week...Like half my loading screens are dead things from the creature photo challenges. I usually purge images every so often though.
---
P.S. The one for "Take a Picture of a Legendary Enemy" in the Ash Heap, seems bugged, I took a pic  of a Legendary Mirelurk and it only counted for the Mirelurk sub challenge.
---
I've had the worst luck with this event. I've done the event successfully once out of four attempts. Crashed every other time either prior to activating the event via computer or during the alpha battle. And can not re enter without the game  dashboarding at the elevator. Doesn't matter if I try another server.
---
Damn that sucks!!! It would of been cool if it would of beefed up the enemy levels at least.
---
You may need to restart the game. Some bugs get like that.
---
As an pistol crit VAT build, I only need 2 stats but they are on 2* and 3*. Fml.
---
Actually it‚Äôs the opposite. As others have posted, each desired roll has a 1/300,000 chance to drop. Since you just got a nice roll, the next 299,999 drops won‚Äôt be as lucky.
---
I‚Äôve seen a 4* glowing rad stag there and when I killed it it dropped like a 2* leather left arm
---
Scorchbeasts are Bravos
---
yeah it can be any random player that you revive.
---
while doing the saboteur ALL RISE  quests, an enclave Message notification came up and said i successfully got a commendation !
---
i thought cool 2 for 1!
---
The strength increase is crazy with unyielding! Also with nerd rage it‚Äôs crazy!!
---
I did while in the burrows last night. It happened to drop a 3* and a 2*. I was in there with a lvl 18 and I'm 84ish. There were a buttload of ledgendaries in there so I think it was a bug.
---
Damn, okay, that explains that. I‚Äôve killed probably a hundred and this is a first. Cool.
---
Oh yeah if it‚Äôs not a boss I‚Äôm one hitting almost everything with my DCG
---
Well even if you take both the 70% and the 90% then find the average it‚Äôs 80%. üßê So I think it‚Äôs about 80% of the time the fast travel doesn‚Äôt work properly. üòéüôÉ
---
Guns forever, Bloodied melee never!
---
I was stuck on the booze challenges before, because Biv never gave me new recipes, it was always a dupe.....I've since bought the missing ones from player vendors..just in case. They halfed the required amount of booze brewed/drunk though a few patches ago, so it's been easier.
---
Both are great but I‚Äôve always been a mellow guy in most games I play
---
I think caps are half your level...?
---
Honestly, I was the same way with the alcohol challenges. But it's new so they're going to overdo it for a few weeks. But I'm also a shutterbug IRL so I don't mind. XD
---
*Heavy Breathing*
---
Hmm, I don‚Äôt know about that. I remember the standard one sitting up higher on the shoulders.
---
If it's so easy then apply for a job at Bethesda and fix it yourself
---
Thank you so much for your help. If you ever need anything and I have it it's yours.
---
My favorite trading abbreviation to see is Ass. Explosive. Always makes me laugh.
---
I Updated the image gallery with my Map location.
---
Time is an illusion of the mind, in truth you never purchased the game. It was always with you, and will be for evermore.
---
Sadly no, none of the clocks work...yet.
---
Ignore the listed damage. Literally all that matters is the level and the legendaries. 
---
People can take all sorts of buffs to make screenshots look good. The only thing that actually matters is the level and the effect. Everything else is your perk/mutation build, and weapon mods (all of which you can change). 
---
But, low-health builds with adrenal reaction and nerd rage are the usual source. Plus hardened receivers.
---
Yeah nothing against it, everyone has their own style.
---
Hahahaha I think he was on ps4 for what it‚Äôs worth. I don‚Äôt have one but everybody seems to have them so I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs worth anything!
---
I got a TS faster fire lmg. But does less damage than my bloody lmg. And it eats bullets faster. Gotta admit it was cool looking.
---
This is partially why I spent like an hour in the Ash Heap today, hunting down creatures for the weekly photo ops...I've got 9/10. I would've had 10/10 if one hadn't bugged and not counted. I never go to the Ash Heap...
---
\*swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing\* 
---
Mob takes 0 hits, you take 5
---
Sure I‚Äôd take either! Got any? Lol
---
Maybe she just wanted your help. Maybe that was your mom.
---
Legit.  My buddy and I have played since beta and he has probably half of the mutation serums known, and I have one.  I'm much lower level but obsessive about farming junk to make caps, and I lend him the caps to buy new ones.  He farms the fluxes and harder ingredients, then we combine our resources to make them.  We sell them for 300 - 500 caps.
---
Unlock. You learn it as soon as you finish the event if that's what your reward rolls to be. You can't sell it, and you can't make them for people since backpacks are not tradeable
---
i thought everyone knew that anyone who  PVPs on adventure, couldn't cut it survival..
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it microcrobial but you sitting I believe near 1/30 for a heavy combat piece, assuming all types of all armor can drops.  
---
I have so far got an inordinate amount of scout armor, but it‚Äôs a small sample size so far.  Honestly have seen very little armor on vendors compared to weapons.     It sure seems people are rolling more weapons so your odds may be more about checking vendors for the weapon of choice. 
---
Also fwiw you likely want to lean more to anti armor for sniper with the acc drop, but beggars can‚Äôt be choosers!
---
Weapon first. You only need 1. 
---
Then go for armor since, well, nothing else to go for at that point.
---
Don't forget radicool in endurance (if you are going bloody I imagine you will have high rads to stay low hp)
---
If your on ps4 I can make carnavor, speed deamon, healing factor, grounded, and at least one more that I can't remember.  Just supply Mats, pay, or traid
---
This. I don‚Äôt believe any actually weigh more.
---
or maybe..
---
it's just some random asshat..
---
Ok I run a bloodied melle build .So Besides the obvious in Strength this is what I run : Endurance Revenant and Radicool (Revenant is BEAST if you can get a revive ) Charisma : I‚Äôve found that 3 points in Tenderizer was better for melee than 4 points in Lone wanderer  .Intelligence: Nerd Rage and 5 points in Weapon smith although lately with repair kits I‚Äôm using explosive to get a boost on offhand range weapon,  Agility: Adrenaline , Ninja , Action Boy ,.. Luck: Bloody mess, Starched Genes, class freak and lastly swap either Serendipity or mysterious savior if in PA ,.. then simply get into a fight when your health dips low enough to proc Nerd Rage use a Stimpak and Swing Away
---
That's because they are in my vending machine.
---
You should visit the party house on the lakebed ;)
---
Every time.
---
I use a variety of gauss, all primed. The ammo is heavy but is reduced by batteries included (similar to bandoleer). The one I use the most is a 1* quad that puts out something like 325 damage. Vats headshots bring down lvl68 scorched and supermutes with one shot. 
---
Add the charge up, plus a first sneak shot at 2.30X with follow up charged headshots and mirelurk queens, SBs, etc will take 5-10 shots.
---
Nope, after patch 9 my water consumption rate became double that of my food consumption rate too, and I had never even gotten a mutation before. It might actually be that the food consumption rate has been slowed, rather than water consumption rate increasing, all I know is that they definitely don't go down at the same rate anymore.
---
Know what another good QoL improvement would be? Event timers on the map. I can't count how many times I've gone across the map to get into an event for it to be almost over or done by the time I get there.
---
i kill the GAS and insult guys, anytime and ever time.
---
have similar problem on pc, for me using e instead of the mouse helps
---
I got that in a Minigun flavour, I call it the Brotherhood Special. Blast those muties into space!
---
Are you on Xbox? You can revive me
---
Smile, bring flowers and say something nice. Also use mouthwash.
---
I did that while teamed up with my brother. I think he's still laughing. I took his scrap also.lol
---
Alright, when I level up and get some more respecs and perks I‚Äôll def use most of those if I don‚Äôt already
---
Well I‚Äôm on PS4 so there we go. It‚Äôs just (probably) a rare collectible like the ones that RuneScape has such as 1/2 Wines, Disks of Return, and other discontinued items that have no use but are rare.
---
That‚Äôs kind of what I was thinking but did not think low health builds would make such a difference. 
---
I hold my own in pve and I‚Äôm having fun. Just feal like I could be do more damage in group events(scorched earth/ encrypted).
---
I dunno why everyone misses the most important melee mutation. Twisted Muscles for 25%+ Melee Damage and Limb Damage. Toss in a nice Glowing Meat Steak for another 10%. ;)
---
Probably a bit un-PC, but my friend and I call the Chinese Liberator robots Yippee Changs.  "Yippy" cause they sqawk like little yappy dogs, and "Chang" is the noise they make when you destroy them...
---
Right, and that does happen, but when I've maxed out the vendor pool I just wait for the next reset. Selling anything for less than what NPC vendors take is literally throwing away caps. That's like MMO economics 101.
---
You on xbox? Lol
---
Yeesh. Wasteland was not good for your skin.
---
Best build system ever. Don't you just love it?
---
I‚Äôve got my hopes on vault 94 being tough dungeon to deal with. Being that what went on there. The high rads and the GECK blowing up.
---
Mmm maybe a clean log cabin set or a vault tech wall set. Wall paper would also be pretty neat too.
---
Alternatively, you could go fuck yourself and... Well that's about it.
---
I currently have every mutation but some I regret getting such as empath
---
I have one I got for 45 caps.
---
Bloody crit+ pipe revolver
---
Isn‚Äôt there a perk that does more damage to glowing enemies, used to use it at a lower level when going into nuke zones
---
Yeah it seemed to work on this occasion, he called me absolutely stupid, I used his words against him and he rage deleted his comment, overall a success, would take part again!
---
350hrs and you can't get more than 2k caps? You should have things figured out by now.
---
Robot vendors alone will give you 1400 caps every 20hrs. You could get enough caps for a recipe in 13days.
---
Several ways exist to maximize supplies. For example green thumb will get 2x the raw flux to help mass produce stable flux. The SBQ event always rewards you a few stable flux as well. 
---
Pharma farma to gain extra chance for chems when looting chem containers. Never have to buy any chems( disease cures) ... on that note, diseases heal after 1hr on their own, if not affecting you dramatically, just let it run its course and heal on it's own. Also Whitesprings has a fountain that heals disease if you drink from it.
---
Repairing weapons/armor? Sbq drops improved repair kits, no need to waste supplies. Also perk cards exist to make repair costs cheaper and make durability last longer.
---
Perk cards like chemist and ammo smith to increase yield when crafting chems and ammo. Then throw in super duper which has a chance to 2x anything you craft.
---
Fast travel perk exists to make it cheaper to fast travel as well.
---
So so many options and ways to play...
---
* I ran with a brotherhood faction for a bit - on brother hood patrols we would all donate all proceeds to one guy - all notes junk etc - in return if we wanted fully modified T60 complete with jumpjets - done - serums ? done - talk about inventories full of multiple tse and god roll items. he had them . none of them were duped. I used a tse explosive gauss rifle at the time. (that I got from him) I had 1 tse explsive gause drop that I gave back to him from a drop and multiple 2 shot gauss rifles. as far as all the other legendaries I couldnt begin to count. in my weapon alone I know he had to have at least 2 just from my single interaction. 
---
   people throw the duper label out there really fast - you cant really tell. bethesda cant really tell which is why they're a bit lax on enforcement. 
---
to put how much loot he took in into perspective we would typically drop 3 or four nukes in about an hour or so. there was about 10 to 15 of us working together - which means 10 - 15 individual generated loot drops per person per queen fight. 1 in 1000 odds of getting any one item get drastically better with that many people cooperating.
---
Do you have an image of it?
---
I'll give ya 3,000 caps for it. lol
---
"...while intoxicated and naked..." this is what bugs me the most about some of the photo challenges. I will not go naked into a rad storm or make my friend do so, thanks. lmao. Why so pervy? "Hack a terminal naked." "Take a photo naked." Why?
---
This thunderous would affect scorched and other creatures in the storm. Also a neat trick if you nuke arktos for example...
---
You can find a terminal and notes in there that reference the music, raiders that used to be there claimed it was a ghost
---
I saw a 4* radscorpion on the Whitespring lawn the other day. Got a crappy 1* stalkers ripper.
---
Try Charleston station, there's small change a vendot bot will spawn outside near the station and will sell the coat for 700 caps
---
Yeah I heard strange knocking aswell
---
Tbh I feel like arktos is good enough, at least for ammo. I can easily burn through 1500 5.56 in a single run. Especially the alpha sheepsquatch, that thing is a ridiculous tank. I feel like it could take out a SBQ if they were given time to fight each other
---
It'd be nice.  
---
What'd also be nice?  
---
A map.  
---
The place is a COMPLETE maze and I spend more time lost in some corner, being killed by ghouls and robots, than ever trying to do the veent itself.  
---
The layout is just terrible for me. :(
---
Have you done sheepsquatch pugs? Sounds like you wanna do some sheepsquatch pugs.
---
Honestly most kids I've seen who play don't understand the basic mechanics of the game, what the pup boy is for, or even why you need to eat. They want to shoot stuff.
---
Yea, with how drastic flooring can change the look of your camp, walls would have the same effect (I think it would be even more of an effect though), and is honestly baffling that there aren't any atomic shop clean walls yet...
---
Yeah cause no game has EVER managed to avoid this 1000 count hard limit
---
Thanks i will try it, ita true ibdid all of them in the same session.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs been awhile since I‚Äôve been in a nuke zone, just remembered a lot of glowing enemies. This would probably convince people to nuke more often. Hope they add in new perks like this
---
Yikes
---
# IM GONNA DIG IT SOME MORE
---
Whitesprings clubhouse. If there's high lvl players stay behind them and just try to shoot every enemy once. Good luck.
---
Would you be will to wait a day? I‚Äôm offline for most of the night.
---
I wish perception worked correctly with the compass. I have a perception of like 29 or so when all is said and done yet can't see Jack shit on the compass unless its less than 20 meters away. Perception is a joke in this game. Just like the draw distance.
---
0 food = bloatfly = you failed
---
Um no that's incorrect because the player is limited to getting 1400 from the vendors a day.  There's no limit to how much they can make from other players everyday however.  If they've emptied their vendors anything they earn from another player puts on them ahead.
---
That's what I've been doing, i've had zero luck finding him, however. Thanks for the info tho :)
---
Splitter doesnt make energy weapon shotguns.
---
Haven't found that one. If I nuke a town or something, what do I look for?
---
That‚Äôs crazy because the only time i went down in the borrows  the ghouls were glowing but don‚Äôt have any ingredients! I‚Äôll have to try again.
---
Yeah, sure. :)
---
I have one for that much in my vending machine. I can log on if you really want it.
---
Ok specs are bloodied +10 damage while aiming +1 agility
---
Oh, alright. Sure
---
Even if all you do is add to the feeders in the beginning, you're helping more than 90% of other players. Don't be shy, just don't be dumb
---
You cant tho...
---
What‚Äôs your gt?
---
I‚Äôd hop on now. But the internet here is really not stable.
---
Apart from the Radio I must say the main battle music in F76 is some of the best I have ever heard in any game. That music can fire me up even on my 200th nuke im launching.
---
What is your perk load out? My lever rife is currently at 145 damage.
---
Aberrant Freak
---
Vault walls please. My Vault dweller just wants to make his own mini-vault.
---
 \-=o=-
---
Still having this problem?  I am, and I'm on Bethesda to solve it.
---
This is why I always crouch with my invis left arm. That way I'm difficult to notice.
---
I can see dupe gangs taking a server over with their players and farm the crap out of it -  duping any good stuff they find or duping old stuff to restock. Not the amateur griefer losers duping stuff, but serious gangs of professional dupers selling online in a storefront.  It wouldn't be hard to take over a server with dupers and go to town. No one there to witness the criminal enterprise.
---
Just need a minute to boot up
---
I scripped the only one ive gotten but ill have a look real quick see if i can find a pic
---
Need to add a milking machine for my character first.
---
Alright üëå
---
Plastic. Never leave the plastic behind
---
Only way I‚Äôve found is to try and put walls on top of them as strategically as possible.
---
Could be if someone is looking for one. Someone paid 2k for my 1star Bloody handmade
---
I scrapped one and didn‚Äôt learn any but it‚Äôs just one- I will try more!
---
Never going to make it on the fire breathers with that attitude!
---
Fo76 isn‚Äôt a real mmo but it‚Äôs going to need those systems to keep a healthy, stable player base. If there were no daily/weekly resets, people would blow through everything and quit. These resets/caps are how games have been keeping players regularly logging in since the beginning of loot based mmos
---
You're not a menace, you're just an annoying kid with nothing better to do.
---
I got a nocturnal lead pipe today! Lol
---
You see a bramhin what do you do
---
                       Milk.   Kill.    Push.
---
You try to milk the cow but no milk comes out
---
You try again and still no milk
---
After your 50 attempt your and with your one perception point you realize it is bull and now a cow
---
Probably not what you were referring to but it popped into my head and I had to type it out
---
 &gt; Profit.
---
Define "profit".
---
I'm over here secretly hoping that the taming and robot perks will be used later to acquire full blown companions.
---
I need my night cheese.
---
I'd like the Institute build sets in FO76. Just copy the designs and give it a new name. Profit BSG!
---
Hello Professor. Would you like to play a game? How about a nice game of chess?
---
‚ÄîModus
---
https://imgur.com/a/ibSz2Go
---
Got it, here
---
thanks ive been grinding and saved up 1700 caps i just bought it at lvl 20
---
1/4 level cap loss. Anything over level 50 drops 12... its bugged it's supposed to be equal to your level max of 50. Still drop all junk and small amounts of aid.. like I said survival is kinda skewed right now and I hope they(bgs) fix it
---
Enjoy. :) go forth and cause shooty mayhem.
---
The part where that's clever?
---
I usually have a bunch of stimpacks on me. You‚Äôre saying max I would lose is 12 per death?
---
Yeah we can make assumptions about people and all that because we disagree with them. But I'm sure we're both adults who go to work, get off and wanna play some games to wind down. Do we do it differently? Sure, but simply claiming I'm a child to disregard anything I say is unproductive
---
Thank you, my vision is being realizedüëçüëçüëç
---
Nice one, enjoy the downvotes
---
That happens when either the player uses or sells the item you are trying to buy while the menu was open.
---
+60% with demolition perk card to max
---
It says you are offline. I sent you an invite.
---
The imposter?
---
Yeah
---
Say the vendor has 10 screws. When you open the menu it shows 10 screws, but while you‚Äôre shopping he uses 4 screws. You try to buy 10 but get an error because there are only actually 6 left.
---
Low health builds are a massive boost. At 20% health, +~60% damage from a Bloodied weapon, ~60% from adrenal reaction, and 15% from nerd rage. And I believe some of those multiply with each other, so it‚Äôs not 60+60+15=135% more damage, it‚Äôs 1.6x1.6x1.15=194% more damage.
---
Not totally sure about that last bit, but even at the low end, it‚Äôs 135% more damage.
---
Well I basically never farm for a large variety of junk as I have excess amounts along with a steady cap increase quicker and more fun than any other way in the game in my personal opinion.
---
To sell to vendors bots.
---
I like the start of this interspecies erotica.
---
You get the plan to make this from the new Arktos event.
---
Ever find a solution?  I'm suffering the same thing, I've tried everything, and Bethesda is useless.  I've got a pile of debug reports saying it's choking on a scaling error.
---
I've not gotten anything too good but some have been upgrades from previous weapons I use regularly.. Examples: Executioner's Explosive Railway Rifle, Furious Lever action with all the VATS perks, 2 Shot Vats 10mm pistol, Ghoul slayer explosive  Pump action. I'd love an AAE Leveraction or hunting rifle though...
---
I'm parked close enough to the starting area that you can see my camp from the Vault 76 exit. I like to mix the prices up - Most Camp blueprints are 40-50, and only a few items have bloated prices (nuka flavors and clean spacesuits); but I try to keep food/water/wood/steel/starter-weapons at either 0 or 1 cap so new players can grab basic resources as they come by... but I find that certain level 100-200+ players tend to grab them. 
---
Seriously, guys... what Lv250 players really need a Lv1 hunting rifle or 200 wood shards?
---
I don‚Äôt believe it. I‚Äôve gotten 20+ 3 star weapons from the purveyor and I‚Äôve gotten pretty much everything except a 3 star two shot.  Wide variety for me at least.
---
I‚Äôm on xb1 and can sell you screws. I also have springs, acid, gunpowder, and lead in bulk
---
Sounds pretty good, survival needs some of its bugs fixed too.. it used to be rewarding to kill others and sell their aid n junk.. but now the reward is slim and doesnt cover the cost of pvp.
---
Ah the old "I just want to unwind from my real, adult, job having, adultness" gambit. Always a classic.
---
Possible the guy came back and sold me 141 screws though when the vendor had only 100.  Either way, I wouldnt doubt that
---
You should try Ark!!
---
Instructions unclear, penis stuck in elevator down to lab
---
Finally, some proof. Thanks for posting. So there's at least one new legendary effect.
---
Is it possible that there were three stars and also a diseased icon that looked like another star?
---
This, it really annoys me when I see that I have however much of black titanium and what not just laying around in my inventory, or circuitry. They're pretty important but can't be bulked.
---
No I must be a useless, unproductive bored asshole in my day to day life for this all to line up. My bad, can we restart?
---
Seems like thats the only new one but yea
---
I just added a guy with a mule like this, i feel like my guy was legit just because I wanted to lol.
---
Try and build your camp near a junk pile, you can find a map of their locations. Helps out a lot early game for some harder to find materials
---
you have to use a computer terminal at your camp. there is a free one in the atom store right now.
---
Agreed, so stupid. And people that have 30 freaking mole miner gauntlet plans need to fuck right off.
---
Doesn‚Äôt happen very often.
---
That sounds right, I usually put 300-400 acid in my shop but keep 100-200 for my use
---
I‚Äôve never seen it either. üòï
---
Yeah, for all the reasons you listed lol
---
üòÇ
---
Fast Travel to camp Venture sometime after 9pm üòâüôÇ
---
r/okbuddyretard
---
Then you meet the guy who drops his price to allow you to buy a 3* and leaving you caps to fast travel. Its all really a crap shoot.
---
I‚Äôd be all for increasing the monetary loss element if these changes were instituted, also the aid drop rate as well.
---
would be awesome
---
Shit bro, you're the one who thinks he cool for menacing PVPing in Fallout 76. You could be curing AIDS in your spare time and still look like a tool.

---
did I?
---
Did you.. just put this together? Dude thank you
---
You know you can start the event anytime right?
---
Camp Adams.
---
Best go at night as I'm not 100% on start times.
---
Do you mean r/fo76bazar
---
I named my quad explosive railway rifle "CHOO CHOO"
---
I'm not cool I'm just farming, gotta have junk to play the game.
---
I could be curing aids but we still need comments like yours around.
---
Bethesda has a hard enough time getting the main game to function. I can't imagine adding four or five sub games.
---
I run an AAE lever I found somewhere in the wild, love it.
---
Respectable, for sure. Did you have a price in mind you were wanting for it?
---
I could be wrong but if you pick just one room and complete that you're good to go.
---
It‚Äôs a random spawn in a variety of places
---
Have you done it yet?
---
I believe some places are a random spawn.
---
This is the problem and I've said it a million times but no one listens. Make it so you can never appear offline. Problem solved.
---
Tried going down eight times yesterday and five times today. Still haven't seen what Project Paradise is like!
---
No but I have watched some videos on YouTube about it so I can learn what the heck is going on before I get in there.
---
I believe the point of the cap is so that god rolls aren‚Äôt obtained by everyone so quickly. If you were theoretically able to complete every build you wanted because of a daily cap increase then what would you be farming for in the dungeon? Maybe for fun? I doubt it after 5 runs. Levels certainly are pointless. This is a loot and shoot game where the desire for the best loot is what keeps players coming back. If players earn the best loot quickly then the player base will fall.
---
Wow ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I didnt think about that at all i just jumped into it lol.
---
Did this event today and the 3rd stage Alpha spawned in another area. However I stayed with our glowing bloodbug friend and he was the only animal to survive. So we passed the event but I missed out on that legendary loot. 
---
Sometimes ya gotta sacrifice for the greater good.
---
Do you mind if I take some inspiration ? By inspiration I mean copy the whole thing but use a different theme :P
---
My friend hardly ever plays and spent his first 100 script last night. TSE LMG bam. I almost killed over.
---
Make orbital scan/strike grenades. Thats what I do with my leftover raw flux.
---
Hahahaha this is my favorite response.  I made math happen.
---
I think the poster means one just for Fallout 76 in-game vendors. Personally I think it's a good idea, it would save a lot of people a lot of caps from just hopping around and not being able to find what they want, also they can place an order.
---
*steal* he says.
---
 &gt; I'm not cool
---
We agree!
---
 &gt; I could be curing aids
---
No you couldn't.
---
One, I like charging outrageous prices for things, if you don't like it shop elsewhere and my store will eventually be forced to change prices or close down.
---
Two, Not everyone selling things for really dumb prices is a mule, I don't even own a donkey.
---
Three, jokes on you, You can't nuke near V76, where my base is located.
---
Four, that's actually pretty funny keep up the good worküòÇ
---
This gets me so mad, esp the campfire quest as its madness with everything spawning it's a race to get a hit in before the obvious level 200 kills it in the blink of an eye then loots and spawns away, it's got to the point where I have to go on mic and repeatedly say from the start to let everyone get a fair shot in so we can all get loot.
---
Most other quests aren't too bad as you get a good amount of time and a clear line of sight to get at least one shot in and the new quests with the lvl 100 give even the level 300s a hard time to insta kill
---
What's the point of this..? Lmao
---
For those who dosnt know how it looks here its a picture on the link.[https://imgur.com/a/OxEjvkJ](https://imgur.com/a/OxEjvkJ)

Go right ahead! I'm sure I'm not the first person to do that idea
---
Jus got my armor plating mod!!!! Fuck that took days..
---
Why did my math get deleted? I sad now. üò¢
---
That's what I just said but with more words
---
they don't have to be on your friend list ? just on the map? 900 plus hours just now learning this. could have saved me a ton of headaches. thank you poster. thank you reddit.
---
Some things are so commonly available in game that having a ton of them for sale is just dishonest. The marker says they have 150 plans, when all they have is easy to get garbage.
---
I dunno. What's the point of pretending to be a raider in a game with only ten people in world at any given time, and infinite resources that respawn?
---
Tell me using fallout shelter
---
Rule 10
---
It all depends on how you play tbh. If you 90% use PA, the mask isn't worth it for something you'll see 10% of the time. Not saying its not badass though.
---
That's really all open world PVP ever is. In MMORPGs it's where all the people who can't cut it in organized PVP end up.
---
I have a machine full of black cowboy hats, take your pick.
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
nuka cola machines fit nicely
---
Have you checked all 3 variants (normal sturdy and heavy).  Unlocks are.... weird to say the least.
---
I think there's a huge difference between wanting to find things that are good, and wanting rare stuff for free/cheap.
---
If the display cases and such are going to follow the same method as the punch bowl, vendor, etc then we are definitely going to need more space.
---
Yaass! My cabin looks like a shanty hut.
---
I was able to move my camp today and replace my Deathclaw topiary. For now, it‚Äôs still mine. But I fully expect the devs to roll through and take all those plants back. Because leaving something for us as a sign of goodwill would be awful
---
Their comments have been deleted, so if you don't mind a quick question, 
---
What *is* a BE weapon?
---
I put one out there so I could install an electric connector I couldn't reach from the ground. Now I can't remove that panel. So I dropped a turent on it so it looks like it belongs there.
---
Servers I'm on are usually maxed out, and I can switch servers pretty easily. And tell me, if I'm having more fun doing it the way I am, and it collects said resources marginally faster, why wouldn't I? RP is only okay if you're being a good guy ?
---
ice machines work great as well, filing cabinets clip together allowing you to create perfectly seemless steel walls.
---
excavator power armor and lucky hole mine. Then farm a yao gaui  dolly sods if you neeed acid to smelt it all. you'll have more lead then you know what to do with. just take you time enjoy the mine and wandering around.
---
You mean Camp Adams right?
---
Nice, I‚Äôve gotten 2 good 3 star weapons. A Vampire assault rifle with exploding bullets and 15% faster reload and an Anti-Armor LMG with exploding bullets and 250 DR while reloading.
---
literally same
---
That's a legacy item actually. Beth removed the explosive effect on laser and energy weapons as far as I know. Good luck on the hunt though, I know a few people selling a few.
---
Yep! And those pieces are missing from the brains of the Bethesda collective.
---
Or reload speed, but yeah I'd love that.
---
Invest in teammates who have lots of stimpaks.
---
Would amend that to say don‚Äôt buy a 3 star til you get a 2 star you really like, and really then go for 3* armor!
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly canon‚Äù != ‚ÄúOnly a bit is canon‚Äù
---
Dolly sods Yao Gaui experience. you get 5-8 per load in. depending on how fast you kill the thing you can just grab em and server hop real fast. I find it more efficient than running through sugar grove and fighting all those enemies.
---
&gt;Bethesda, we don't doors or ugly carpets... We want walls!   
---
I think you accidentally a word
---
trash on the floor is why I prefer building my own camp from scratch. I automatically go into police call mode and want to pick up all the little bits of trash and dispose of them.
---
Just tried again. Can‚Äôt kill them in Survival mode. Can in Adventure. From these comments it seems it is only me. Fuck this.
---
4 Stars have been in the game; but are incredibly, incredibly rare.
---
Same goes with 4 star weapons, except the onlyway to receive a 4 star weapon is modding a 3 star weapon
---
*(i.e.: sacrificial mod on machete or modding prime receiver on a 3 star)*
---
Ya I hear ya, personally havn't modded since TES3, but if it's at all similar, value adjustment is super duper easy like u said.  And there are defiantly more than one wepon I've never used because it's just garbage.
---
Turn the generator on in the fake vault
---
Laser gun = Sparks
---
Tesla rifle = Mjolnir
---
Fire axe = Industry Standard
---
Plasma gun = The Algorithm
---
&gt; I drop heavy stuff like miniguns and the like.
---
*laughs in ever weight reduction perk and 4/5 peices of weapon weight reducing armor
---
A level 120 alpha boss would be a nice additional challenge.
---
Any chance we can get Robotic Expert to allow for taming robots?
---
*laughs because i use the same perks for melee weapons\~ almost like there's different playstyles or something*
---
Lol i saw that on the fallout Miami discord
---
Where is that, the power terminal doesn't have anything
---
I've got a prime shotty TSE 90% reduced weight if interested.
---
Explosive minigun is Splodygun
---
"~Abroham Lincoln" is my lever action
---
"~You may be seated" is my All Raise hammer
---
"~Scritches" is my Deathclaw gauntlet.
---
"~Gauss Bauss" is my Gauss rifle
---
"~Hungry Hungry Mr. Handy" is my now retired Mr. Handy buzzblade(retired because the fix to weapon artisan made him unusable)
---
And that is why you fail.  It is also why when you sleep you need to wonder if you will still have your kidneys when you wake up or if one of your was feeling a bit peckish. 
---
When all is said and done we will have built a better world to leave to those that come after us. All you will have is your loot, and a desperate prayers to gods you long abandoned, begging them for mercy, for we will have none, not for your kind.

Amen

I went to Whitesprings ONE time at level 12 to see someone's shop for plans. His rocket turrets were firing off nonstop, there's an elite wendigo charging me on the platform, getting blasted, 4 glowing ferals beind me coming from the river, and 2 mirelurk razorbacks smacking the vending machines, while there's 6 rocket turrets firing off. Was so fucking confused and distraught in this sudden warzone lmao

It's almost completely Canon all that's not is mostly npc and quest lines stuff not actually world or mutant lore plus I said I think tactic but the Midwestern bos did have ghouls

The fact that every single sentence you said was so completely wrong means that you have hardly touched the game or were expecting a game that it never promised to be
---
Everything is mutated. We are technically, as vault dwellers, the purest things around. Mutant slayer is good in some situations, super mutants have alot of health. Maybe bump enemy based legendaries ie exterminaters, hunters, troubleshooters up to 50%. Then we would get excited in aquiring them. Imo junkies is the one that is absolute trash
---
The stash space issue makes rad ant lager a valuable commodity
---
IT was an open field, that had a small BoS encampment with anti air turrets you can repair, with a fissure RIGHT nearby.
---
I like this, this is an actually well thought out response.
---
The stars and symbols are a common folklegend that supposedly ward off the snallygaster spirit. In its tale, its a fast, bird like ghost that kidnaps cattle and causes mayhem, but one of those symbols will keep it at bay.
---
You have to go into the player list and find their name to accept a party invite.
---
I could see having the shield as a power armor exclusive thing. Since they cannot use fist weapons. Make it like a car/bus door.
---
And of course give us a Captain America variant for the atom shop. Everyone wins ^u^
---
Reading terminals is what took me so long to complete Fallout 4.  
---
That and I sneak everywhere.  üòâ
---
Probably 700-1k caps. 500 caps at a vending machine.
---
Your not a teamplayer i guess so whatever you say doesn't really hit home. Stop making up excuses to be greedyüíï
---
&gt; 400 circuit boards
---
Excuse me sir but circuits are not junk
---
should be a quest marker to follow  directing you down a level. I know its downstairs from the computer terminal but if your marker is bugged I could only say look around for it.
---
Right -  events are once per day xD he must be in a different game for sure.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yes my bad.
---
Did you read the post? He said he's suck of doing that.
---
If it feels like a burden to play maybe you're just not enjoying the game man.
---
Nope, stored and moved 2 machines on xbox when re-organizing camp...  no sales prices/etc los.
---
your talking about the brother hood of steel on that send you to the vtu lab right? hmm heres a walkthrough i just found [https://youtu.be/OJrniZo0a30](https://youtu.be/OJrniZo0a30)
---
The great thing about Fallout is the freedom we have. If they want to sell it, let them. I haven't logged in weeks.  
---
I have better things to do and not a lot of time to play when I do. If I get back into it, I'll sell what I had originally planned to do for my char.
---
Oh lmao, oops
---
Martial Artist FTW
---
To be fair it is a level 30 something enemy. An player with a decent legendary melts that thing.
---
It's best not to ask. Don't ask about the candy apples in the toilets either.
---
I made r/Fo76_player_vendors
---
I meant it so that you can advertise your vendor or ask for spesific stuff.
---
I really don't want to be mod so I can make whoever wants as a mod for that community :P
---
But I half agree, I like having my ugly carpets and doors, but would *also* like some more walls
---
I believe it gives 20% extra from the base. Demo expert only boosts that 20%
---
Never seen any for sale or trades on pc, most likely consoles
---
Like Publisher's Clearing House: "You may already be a winner!"
---
Yes I was so excited when I figured it out! Chemistry station jacked up with frogs and candles, tinker has an old radio and a bunch of junk all over it... Really makes them come alive!
---
I need this in my life
---
Oooo I'm liking your ideas. This could have some great application to the game.
---
Lots of players will probably want the captain America variant.
---
Definitely not. I can love a game and have issues with some of its systems. 
---
The game itself isn't a burden, but having to log in every single day to make use of the items that I've earned from playing the game that I love isn't ideal.
---
^I died when I read this! XD
---
I've only enountered the insult bot once and loved it. Can't go 20 minutes without the prize bot scaring the mess out of me.
---
Hey, I resent that.  As a 200 level, if I see anyone else at an event I switch to a lower level weapon, get a hit in, and then let everyone else get a wack. I usually rock a Mutant Slayer 10mm auto pistol for just this situation. 
---
Plus, use your headset if you see this happening. Most will swap out for a lower level weapon.
---
Nvr completed it bc of this bug. Does it reward anything good?
---
Its not like their aren't more than 1. At the rate I'm getting BP's I'll have to do Project Paradise like 100 times to get all the BP's.
---
To me its just annoying doing what is essentially the only strictly high level dungeon in the game and not even being rewarded a blueprint most of the time.
---
Ammo
---
You guys make early life great! Ill buy up that 10mm ammo and a nice bbq plan for my wood crap shack. Dont listen to the loud minority.
---
Are you on PC? Press enter when you click the event location.
---
As soon as it starts getting dark I just travel to Camp Adam and I get it every time. It doesn't start til someone goes there at night time.
---
careful bears are attracted by the menstruation.
---
It‚Äôs been my go to stimpack ingredient chasing spot since I started playing. I‚Äôm not questioning it, I only praise it lol
---
I call super mutants Mutes, ghouls are always collectively called "Boys and Ghouls" and scorchbeasts are called "sigh, God dam it...not another one"
---
I had the same issue. What i had to do was go to fort defiance on the top floor and read the document and holo tape, go back to the university and power terminal now gave me the option to route power.  Before the quest used to only trigger by reading that document. My guess is the auto triggering of the quest is glitched and you still need to trigger it the old way.
---
Ok, I admit it. I'm a junkie. Over 100 radx, radaway. Recently sold 100 radx, was over 200. A few berry mentats and phycostats. Then there's the 300 stimpaks.
---
All the mini games from NV were great. Wod love to see them in this.
---
Yes please.
---
Cha ching!
---
This....with flechett mod is awsome and never have to worrie about ammo
---
Wow, that really sucks. But on the bright side, you now have some warm regards to cherish forever.
---
Wood armor. Its only got 1mod which boosts sneak and speed. I can literally sneak right in front of an enemy in broad daylight. Other than that use shadowed mod and chameleon legandaries.
---
125 for 100% is what i do. 25c more than others but I make up for it in cheap chems.
---
Dayum 7 perfectly preserved pies someone‚Äôs putting out a hit on you! üòÇ
---
Just go to Wavy Willard's and server hop until the tourist spawns on the burnt out car in the middle of the parking lot. Saves time and caps on fast travelling.
---
The diffuser and bear arm drops actual plans. I have received them both so far.
---
I ran into one at cranberry bog. He was fighting 3 albino radstags. Then a buscrab showed up. What a fight. I hid behind a tree and watched in amazement.
---
Yeah, I think any event everyone should get loot. I get so tired of 1 shot kill people. We're all there doing the work, and you get the loot? wtf.
---
I agree  like a want wooden walls that look like a presteen caben or just wooden walls that looks better inside than out side
---
Yo! GT: phoe4 im on most afternoons pacific time
---
Weapon adjustments is my big one cuz I get that every weapon can't just be op but would you rather have a handmade or assault rifle? Would you rather use lazer rifle or alien blaster? Legendary hunting rifle or crossbow? No matter the effects on the weapon, some are just better regardless in every way. Each weapon should have an advantage over other ones. Crossbow could offer different bolts to get more damage or dps at least. Assault rifle is just too weak compared to handmade and doesn't have anything to balance that out. Don't get me started on the alien blaster
---
Don‚Äôt touch them cuz they might have aids
---
I've gotten a few really fun ones. Tonight ...
---
FE Handmade

Quad / FFR revolver

Staring at these screenshots, and If I didn't know I hadn't been online in the last few days I'd say you just killed meüòÇ
---
My adventure boi is over-encumbered with booze and food even with thru-hiker 3 on
---
Not to mention the fact that every time you put something o your face your beard ceases to exist. I just bought the skull mask and now I'm clean shaven. What the shit, Bethesda. For the love of beard, i can't look badass when it makes me look like a toddler out for halloween. Please, I just want beards+face wear (bandana, masks that only cover the top half of face, etc.)
---
I barely use PA but PA skins are pretty much all I buy. Got a few weapon skins, but they barely have any for weapons I actually use
---
I believe Ultracite guns/ammo are more effective against scorch and the scorchbeast/Queen
---
I found one in someone‚Äôs vendor for 400 caps :) haven‚Äôt taken it off since
---
Wise choice
---
Meaning they should really just find a different game that caters to those needs.
---
That's a great question. Why wouldn't you?
---
I‚Äôve got 3-4 sets each of L15 raider, L25 T-45, L30 T-51, L40 T-60, and max level versions of the same (minus raider) stashed on a mule. 
---
I‚Äôve had 1 frame do some weird stuff with renaming, but I‚Äôve been able to have them all out at once. Granted, I collected and organized mine over a fairly long period of time, but I did some funky mass-resetting of them when we got the ability to name frames. Only a couple weird issues there, mostly about names not going on the right frame, and that may have just been me.
---
Why don‚Äôt you go to survival of your so keen and witty and great at pvp? Other players aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcowards‚Äù they are playing adventure mode to avoid d-bags like you. And what your talking about isn‚Äôt raiding IMO  it‚Äôs a cheap con that proves you suck at the 1 thing you seek to do in the game is all.
---
Can you modify it?
---
That‚Äôs pretty smart too.
---
I just want that sweet cloth haha. Paddle ball ammo is expensive
---
Search up patch 5, patch 6, patch 7, patch 8, patch 9, and patch 9.5 notes
---
new stuff includes burrows quest/mini-dungeon, arktos pharma dungeon, lying lowe questline, pioneer scouts questline, and the nukashine "quest" if you can really call it that. legendary vendor is at berkely station (just east of harper's ferry), you sell legendaries for scrip to machines at train stations and buy random-ish legendaries from her with the ability to choose melee/guns/armor and 1*/2*/3*
---
I think no, my main have full inventory of legendaries with cooldown at legendary machine, so i am not buying any legendaries, if i cant scrap them.
---
+karma
---
Ah okay thanks now I can get back to my adventuring and looting tomorrow knowing somewhat what the hell is going on
---
Pretty interesting little bit of history is what they are
---
http://www.heritagebarnquilts.com/
---
There's also been a few posts on the Fo76 Reddit about the "Barn Quilts" as they are called.
---
I dropped it all at once, all in armor, and I got one Vanguard leather piece that was better than what I already had for that slot. I also got some Sentinel armor that I‚Äôve sold.  The rest were Poisoners, etc. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty set for weapons at the moment with a two-shot explosive hunting rifle, a furious sledge with +40% swing speed, a furious double barrel shotgun, and a Zealots Explosive .50 Cal Machine  Gun. 
---
The sledge and the .50 Cal Machine Gun were drops just prior to the new vendor while farming for legendary items to trade in. 
---
In other words, I‚Äôve had better luck with normal drops so far.  But, I have about 450 credits saved up, so I‚Äôll have another kick at the can tomorrow. 
---
Perhaps we need a mega thread with results from different servers so that people can try jumping on to a server that is paying out the type of item that they are looking for.
---
Yep. Ultracite is better against Scorched. But more expensive to craft.
---
Wait, it isn't still beta? I can't believe it's another fallout game that crashes constantly, at least they are staying consistent with every other fallout game. I just can't believe that Bethesda has deemed any of the games done. As a programmer, I'd be ashamed to have my name attached. It's an awesome series, but the execution has always left something to be desired.
---
Wait, so you aren't even playing the game, why are you even replying to this? Clearly it's not an issue for you, because you aren't playing. I'd be totally fine with people selling whatever for however much, if it weren't wasting everyone else's time. If I could hover over a CAMP and see what they're selling, and not have to travel over there, defend their CAMP before even seeing that they've got 30 Mole Miner Gauntlet plans for 500 caps each, I'd be totally fine with people selling garbage. But if I'm going to spend caps, defend your house, and then get garbage offers? Yeah, that sucks and people shouldn't do that.
---
If there is a chem that allows you to do that I am not aware of it (Overdrive: [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Overdrive\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Overdrive_(Fallout_76))).
---
Raid on!
---
Yes, and that *includes* the well placed, even-through-frequent, f-bombs! It's quite hard to find quality usage of vulgarity on the internet these days!
---
And I am quite literally serious, too. Twas a great read, indeed, so kudos to [u/Psychatix](https://www.reddit.com/user/Psychatix/) :D
---
Bloodied is good. Worth the caps.
---
Safest most reliable source is http://fallout.bethesda.net I'd just scroll back on the news till you stopped playing - tons has changed. Cap limit of 1400 across all vendorbots, repairable KidSecureID Bracelet, Whitesprings is a Vendorbot Hub, Player Vending is up and running, legendary vendor like you said, and a crap ton more. 
---
To touch on the legendary vendor though - trade in legendary weapons or armor in return for a new currency called scrip, high the stars more scrip you get. Use scrip to roll for a legendary armor, melee weapon, or ranged weapon, 1-3 stars.
---
yeah I could never find the plans for the solid metal walls or the brick walls so my camp looks real bland
---
Is it worth buying 2* weapons over 3*?
---
That says 25% crit chance for 3 minutes.
---
I lost all quest markers so no idea what to do next 
---
Can't believe you have to do this childish nonsense zero-challenge scout bs to be able to make a backpack yet I can easily make suit of power armor and a night vision sniper rifle.
---
K.
---
Maybe.
---
/thread
---
Brahmin milk + brain fungus = brie
---
In a heartbeat.
---
Depends on what you  do in the game. I don't use power armor out side of nuke zones and I don't use energy weapons. They aren't worth holding onto for me. I listed a hundred of them in my camp a week ago (at base price) and they never sold, so they aren't worth keeping for sale, either.
---
i have no space because of mats
---
You've been hitting too much Psycho
---
Im happy you guys have shared. Im not very efficient with the new VATS so I dropped it all together, but it seems like it‚Äôd change the battle when it comes to bloodbugs and closing distances. Thank you.
---
Sure you did....
---
Perception contributes to vats weapon accuracy I would hardly call it a joke unless you don't use vats. Even then there are perk cards in perception that are useful to any build (especially glow sights).  I have no idea if it actually works with the compass I just read something to that effect on a loading screen. Maybe the effect it too small to notice? How did you test it?
---
&gt;I just really like cheese, but maybe milkshakes, yogurt, or milk and rum
---
Milkshakes, great got it. Love milkshakes we should totes be able to make them
---
Yogurt, that would be pretty cool, get some probiotic food up in the Apoc'
---
Milk, yeah we have milk. Next item.
---
Rum, ...........rum is made with milk??????when, why, how????üòÇ
---
In all seriousness, I would love for more Cooking recipes and things to do with each ingredient.
---
Also, There is a recipe for a White Russian which uses milk.
---
Because very few people carry junk in survival, and you make like 6 caps a kill. Kinda speaks for itself
---
Yep. This. All walls, top and bottom, must be in line.
---
Didnt work for me. I took a picture of a scorched in the rain and nothing happened.  :(
---
Don't bother --  the enemies in the Burrows and Project Paradise don't drop stabilizers.
---
You mean Bulk your junk at a tinkers work bench?
---
Cool! Hey, I'm not both tired and sick I swear ;)
---
First you gotta craft a frog habitat which is found under science projects in the chemistry bench, then you have to collect a frog and then you can place it at your camp.
---
Lol. I've got a sledgehammer with those rolls, and is only a 2\*.
---
I use them for repairing mainframe cores for nuke silos
---
Oof forgot about the nerf! THAT is a good point at least. Don‚Äôt agree with conning people into PVP, that is so lame it‚Äôs embarrassing, but I do get why people are back in adventure to pvp for profit at least.
---
awesome
---
ooooh how do we rename frames? I'm you tubing that I didn't know that was possible. that would make thins so much better. 
---
it sounds like to me you're doing exactly what I want to be doing. so maybe I will just reduce the volume and build up sets one at a time rather than trying to mass sort them out.
---
I like to double things, like from 800 to 1600 :D
---
Yea my recent list is always blank after I get kicked! Very annoying and they  should 
---
 definitely add the option to rejoin last server!
---
Camp Adams after 930pm. I'm not sure what time it becomes unavailable after that but I have started it as late as 5am
---
Mine is also 145. Came here to ask the same question!
---
Eh I mean, they willingly attack a level 30 as a group so I wouldn't say it's conning into PvP even. Their fault half the time for agreeing to PvP can't be mad you didn't check for others. Hate how everyone will snatch up a 10 cap bounty but "I don't PvP"
---
Hey there, I haven't played 76 and I don't get it? Can someone explain this image?
---
I know the reason behind the cap-tax, but I prefer to think that the caps we lose on sales are stolen by a mysterious entity that hides inside the machinery of the stores. Either using caps for substance or hoarding them. 
---
At night, you can hear the clip claps of the little guy as he goes to sleep on a nest of the caps he has gathered.
---
What platform?   I get building sets for my shop every so often from events.  I think that I have the warehouse set up on it now (rusty metal, not the clean one) [PS4]. 
---
According to the wiki, the metal building plans are sold by the BOS vendor at Watoga Mall.
---
Some bulking is worth it (so I‚Äôve been told/done).  Mainly if you pick up an item, scrap it, and the contents way less than the item (in some cases I believe). I should really study and see what‚Äôs most beneficial.  I just end up scrapping most/all my junk üòÖ
---
Sorry just got caught up, I‚Äôm on now if you want to team up
---
What‚Äôs a stimpak diffuser
---
hell yes thank you sir - the renaming bit will help me so much [https://youtu.be/yfpK5BdHw3w](https://youtu.be/yfpK5BdHw3w) most get to the pointy vid I found out of the top few searches. in summary inspect the item in inventory then rename option. /facepalm 900 + hours dunno how this slipped past me.
---
Ye, there's a lot to do in the game at this point.
---
Current bugs to look out for - 2* or 3* wood armor from the legendary vendor will turn to 1* after you log out. Immediately turn it to scrip if you get it, or just hold off on getting armor from her for now. Similar issue with assaultron heads, if you get a legendary one from the purveyor it will lose its prefix mod. Looting them from legendary enemies is fine though
---
Some of the possum/tadpole scout challenges are broken. One I remember for sure is the musician one. Playing instruments for any amount of time will not check off the challenges.
---
Some camp building stuff is still wonky, but I'm not up to date on what's been fixed and what hasn't. If something seems off just look it up and there are probably threads with temporary workarounds here
---
In-universe the Institute wouldn't exist for another eight years.
---
Hey, that got me thinking though. What's 25% of 0? Are we absolutely certain this allows crits outside of vats? I have to try this to be sure.
---
New plan from the project paradise event
---
Personally, I'd prefer the opt-in notifications for types of events suggested in another thread. Something like click the event icon and have a "favorite" option there in addition to "fast travel".
---
Well that's disappointing.
---
Same way you rename everything else! :)
---
In my weightless BOS armor with chameleon mutation, I can do the same thing. I‚Äôve had enemies actually bump into me and not trigger a fight lol.
---
Ahhh because it‚Äôs new as of patch... 8 I want to say. Works on any weapon/armor that doesn‚Äôt stack.
---
Saddly I'm on PC
---
It is not. I'm on PC and people are having the same issue. My team of three was doing the event and it hard froze all of our games at the same time. I mean an actual freeze and had to kill it with task manager. And no, they didn't test it. Not in any real world way. The problem is too widespread.
---
This is hilarious!
---
Robot companions would also be a nice addition.
---
yes gatling laser uses regular fusion cores  prime and ultracite use ultracite fusion cores and they do 30% more damage against scorched. warning though if regular gatling laser is your main the ultracite cores will glitch and rejoing the pool of regular cores and waste all the resources spent crafting the ultracite ones.
---
Me too! Haven't found it at any vendor! Love this gun on boss dudes, and thus would top it off.
---
As typical of Bethesda, they screwed the pooch on this one too.
---
I was with a group, who where able to figure out the need to fill the feeders, we actually completed the event, however, the final boss corpse vanished, we where beating it's ass, it died, and poof, no corpse, event complete.  
---
pathetic.
---
Just like the imposter SS, or the SBQ, don‚Äôt go in with junk.  Or loot after the event.  It‚Äôs a hard lesson and doesn‚Äôt make it nice for people to do it but it‚Äôs a simple solution ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I would think about it less as a % of a whole and instead like adding a 1in4 chance to fruit while attacking.
---
What if you get herbivore and carnivore at the same time? Can you eat both meat and vegetables? Or will you just starve to death when you run out of sugar bombs and instamash!?
---
I'm mutated and I think this would be dope. I can imagine a Purest Enclave Build, yelling "death to all mutants!"
---
A bunch of animals for that challenge can spawn across the river from the Overseer‚Äôs camp.  The difficult part was finding the weapons for the challenge.
---
I'd have happily paid 2k+ for mine. Actually bought one off a player for 900 caps and found another that someone dumped on the Camden vendor bot.
---
Yeah performance is an issue.
---
Yeah, that's all well and good. However as a sniper build, you come into this game expecting perception to work the way it has in all previous fallout games. It doesn't by a country mile. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it still works correctly for vats, sorta. But it's still a joke.
---
Just keep doing the bug part gathering quest every day. I've been collecting them for the hell of it, since it doesn't seem like there is any way of crafting them.
---
The wife and I called the Scorched "fakers" since so many are posing around pretending to be ash statues.
---
10/10, would read again.  
---
In fact, I actually *did* read it again! :D
---
Was 'literally' that good, even *with* the typographical errors lol
---
I'm also seriously torn on whether to upvote it or not, cuz... it's sitting at "76" right now... So I guess...  
---
RemindMe! 10 hours "Upvote Psychatix's story if it's ‚â† 76."
---
I get them from the queens
---
hi
---
Thank you! That's alittle annoying, may just stick to my sheepsquatch shards but oh well
---
There are already a bunch of trade subs, why make another?
---
Yeah sheepsquatch is the worst lol
---
The sad part is that its just junk and it's everywhere.
---
Yeah I've just gotten used to carrying all my materials on me so I can repair whenever. Plus I have Pack Rat, which doesn't help with my hoarding. Thanks for the advice, I guess I'll have to change some things up.
---
I had it for a week in my machine, no one bought it, so I took it to a vendor! Lol

You have to do the mission every day and get lucky which is a shame because I would love to be able to craft them I would also love a way to get pumpkin seeds outside the daily mission because most of the base game dailies are bugged for me.
---
I was going to do a grenade build that uses the pumpkin and bug grenades then wear the plague doctor mask but you cant get either without having to do the missions each day.
---
I sell cigars, cigarettes and now also comfy pillows.  Have not got into the TP market.
---
Personally, I would murder an entire camp full of people for a comfy pillow on a RL apocalypse, and have you ever been around a smoker that can‚Äôt smoke?  These things WILL sell to any self respecting RPer!
---
I do have tank killer, but I want more armor pen.  Currently, the lever action is for soft targets and the hunting rifle with the perforating magazine for more armored targets.
---
Fallout. Fall outta the servers
---
I meant the concept of joining a team to force pvp. Yea I do see people seeking out bullshit 5-10 cap bountys! When I see someone with a bounty like that the thought doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind! And if I get one by some odd chance I ask the first person I see to kill me so I‚Äôm not surprised by Appalachia‚Äôs dog the bounty hunter who just spent 24 caps fast traveling to collect a 10 cap reward!
---
hey there (Y) Which platform are you on? :) My bad if it's on xbox or ps4, I totally forgot to add it in the post, but have edited in now.
---
xbox :(
---
and the people crashing once they get inside the even after 30 sec to 3mins.
---
Why t51 and not t60 or x01
---
In my opinion yes for weapons, the third stars are hardly ever useful, so by way of simply generating more rolls with going 2* you have a better chance of getting something good or useful, however armors are worthless unless they're 3*.  So you'd always want to roll for 3 since those are cheap enough.
---
You did know that you dont need to carry junk to repair anywere bud?
---
ahh shoot, too bad. Sorry again about that. Thanks for replying to the post regardless though :)
---
TIL
---
Make a mule character I have 2 lol.
---
Thanks! Came in handy for the survival challenge this week
---
Friends list or recent players list will bring you back together.
---
Yeah, the pain is people like myself whose memory isnt very sharp trying to remember that stuff.  I may start snapping a screenshot every nuke zone of the map so I can use it if I drop to rejoin through player profiles.  Easier than trying to remember
---
TIL ?
---
There do seem to be a lot of doodoo vending machines.
---
You in team?
---
I mean, I'll take a spinning with guns emote or photo pose as well.
---
My vendors have @320 plans on them. Most of it is common stuff. I get sales every day and am generally happy when I see someone was able to pick up something they don't have yet, just like I'm happy when I come across a reasonably priced plan I need in someone else's. I've even had customers give me their extra plans to sell because they like the idea of a plan/recipe one stop shop. :)
---
Today I Learned
---
Looks like you have what you need.  
---
I did see a mention that you might still want Chameleon.  If so, I have it in my store for 275 caps [PSN:  IceFire_DH].  
---
I can craft Marsupial, Chameleon, and Speed Daemon.
---
I quickly reach my limit of 1400 caps at the vendors.  So, anything on top of that is gravy.  At 275 caps per serum, other players can buy it and make a profit selling them back to the vendors. 
---
Materials are easy.   I lucked out to connect to a server that just had a QSB fight and just started farming (had glowing and hardened mass saved up from a White Springs Nuke event last night).  Sever then crash and dumped on another that just had a White Springs event, it was at the tail end but I was able to farm a bit more stable flux. 
---
Now I just need to stock up on Glowing and Hardened Mass again.
---
There is an affect that boosts damage while aiming.  I believe it is a 10% bonus and hip firing counts as aiming.
---
Very brazen of you to stalk a creepy ghost witch.
---
Ok üëç
---
Yeah, it usually does, but this time my recent players list had no "recent" players on it.  My friends list doesnt even exist, so thats a wash.  Oh well.
---
There's just something beautiful about a woman dressed to the nines taking down a scorchbeast queen with a minigun.
---
Yes.
---
Laaaame. Sorry man. Possibly your systems ‚Äúrecently played‚Äù? Ps4 has a separate one and I think steam does. Not sure about xbox
---
I always modded out the compass. After ede in nv i could see shit for miles and it was annoying. Think someone is around the bend... Nope they are around the mtn haha
---
It's supposed to be 3* and take up 4 pts üòÅ
---
You don't need to carry anything on you to repair it takes from your stash. as for your hording you should see what your using and anything that doesn't  get used you should toss or bulk and sell to vendors for me I always get too much bone, glass, fabric, leather and will only keep at most 100 in my stash at any time
---
They made 4/5 challenges extremely tedious and overly specific that you get a headache just thinking on how and where to do it.
---
I just ignore them and do the one that takes 10 minutes at most. Less atoms but whatever.
---
Not a bug it's been that way since launch. Lvl 1 lone wanderer is 2 pts, level 2 is 3 pts, level 3 is 4 pts. Certain perks have higher special requirements.
---
Ah yes. You're right. My bad
---
I did get them all back but still thank you for reaching out.  And thanks for explaining why it makes sense for players who can craft serums to sell them at lower prices to players than the vendors pay.
---
So getting around 10k caps a day is plenty for me so I don't really care what people do with the stuff they buy.
---
If they up it you will 100% cry next month to increase it aggain.
---
Oh hell yes. Seeing the queen up close would be crazy, or watching a nuke hit in vr would be so cool!
---
Cant be upvoted enough.  Every damn day i‚Äôd nuke whitespring.  The early xp there was insane.  The double XP weekend brought back fond memories.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt mind having about 15 worthless perk cards back, but at this point I‚Äôm getting oddball staff anyway so not a huge deal.
---
I‚Äôd also not sell my tattered field jacket to a vendor thinking it was ugly Bc I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs rarity.
---
Do you think it would be worth it to have a mod that does that?
---
It can only be earned from the sons of Dane event called violent nights or something like that, brain won‚Äôt let me remember it‚Äôs actual name right now. I‚Äôm role-playing as a brewery so I want to grind a slab before I start selling it ;)
---
If you play on Xbox, there is the screenshot feature. You can save your pictures that way. I've been doing that and downloading them to my computer through the Xbox app.
---
At level 12 you're going to want to stick to the toxic valley. Make sure to get your sleeping buff. Clear out Grafton Steel of Super Mutants, and take the workshop and defend it. You'll level up pretty fast. When you get closer to level 20 move on to the Ash Heap.
---
Checked the data, looks like there are no scrap mods (they're linked directly the weapon entry). I couldn't find any vendor/drop mods either, but that's a manual search so I can't be certain.
---
Not sure where I heard it but some one mentioned 5% damage is needed to get loot
---
They are free to do it. I can follow what's going on in the game without playing it. It's not hard.  
---
There are forums and Discord servers for groups so one can easily see things without currently playing it.  
---
It's the post-apocalypse. WAAAAAH. You sound like the game is supposed to change for you.  
---
You can message the player if online and find out without traveling.
---
Dude must have been the pack mule for the team he was with. I can picture it now. Team mate goes down and yells "Medic!  Medic!" Then pack mule shows up and just shrugs his shoulders.
---
There are numerous random spawn locations around the world, and many of them can spawn a sheepsquatch and various other things.
---
LOL I love it. Free acid and springs!
---
&gt;the reason Bethesda haven't made a stable game and fixed all the issues were having on a daily basis because they're having to clean up your mess before they can sort it 
---
The dupers were putting effectively performing load/stress tests on the servers with all the crafting they needed to do in order to force disconnects, and it's always frustrating when you suddenly get kicked from a server, but even now we still get frequent disconnects after these duping methods were fixed. The fixes they made were just simple workarounds/hacks that would not take months of work to complete. They had to fix dozens of bugs in the game over the first few months because the game wasn't really in a fit state to release in October 2018, plus they were also adding more content to the game.
---
Also, flooding the in-game market with TSE weapons is not going to cause *all the prices to sky rocket*. In fact prices of TSE's only went back up to 15-25k (from 5-10k) after the last dupe glitch was fixed, in addition to the multiple copies of TSE's being removed from players accounts. It's simple supply and demand. Cut the supply and prices will rise. If anything would cause that, it would be players repeatedly server hopping to collect cap stashes so they could buy pretty much anything they wanted.
---
I‚Äôm guessing a bloodied build but without a bloodied weapon. Adrenal reaction, nerd rage. Not sure what else boosts damage at low health.
---
Yeah, ED-E was a bit much. I just wish they would do something with the draw distance. When you compare it to beta and even after launch compared to now. It's just laughable. Where I used to be able to snipe at coming close to a 1000 meters, I'm lucky if I can even see the enemy a stones throw away half the time.
---
Yep, It was no big deal. We vault dwellers always help each others in the wastelands :)
---
All are wrong. The colour is different and they don't share mods. You have to unlock them separately.
---
Its really all I want to do.  Kill things and look fabulous.
---
Isn't that where you do all your drugs? I mean I do. Us vampires get high off that good stuff.
---
I do use mic and I'm sorry I know there are a lot of higher level players like yourself who have helped me countless times, earlier I did the quest about 5 times and 4 of those times a high level ruined it knowing full well what they were doing
---
Disagree. Hard to believe you're doubling down on this lame joke. Clickbait in this medium stifles discourse. I come here for information, not cheap attempts to garnish Karma. From what I've seen, any moderation is better than no moderation.
---
Hmm?
---
Lol yup. Gira plan everything out including down to the second, hits and misses what undies to wear, and your asultron pickup lines.
---
/S
---
So do as I do and use a 10mm pistol or something so everyone gets a hit in...at this point everyone should know that you only get the xp and loot if you get a hit in, killing things that aren't a lvl 10 or below like that is just shitty
---
Im on xbox never had that problem, what is it?
---
Unfortunately there are always a few.  I‚Äôm just saying that most are not like that.
---
Tragic that you're all still playing this abortion of a game. Nothing good about wasting your life on such a flawed, ridiculous game.
---
I‚Äôm from the UK i can help you at 19:00 British time
---
I can‚Äôt kill a firefly in Survival for the weekly challenge. I can in Adventure mode but not Survival. All because they fixed the glitch that let you earn the reward in Adventure mode. Yay
---
Seen this a lot, you do hard job and die, ask for help and ppl will literally eat you.

...your logic is interesting. Of course they are free to do it. Just as I am free to ask them not to. ...and they are free to decide to be decent sales people. Anyone CAN put anything up for sale, but chances are good you're not going to sell garbage, so why waste your own space and bog down your own potential profit, spite? I mean, ok. 
---
And I can't message people, I'm on PC. There is NO way to contact players in game unless we are friends and know each other outside of the game.
---
Sometimes you jump back to the same world. Had it drop me in the same world twice the other day.
---
You're a drama queen, and you talk too much.
---
In the pip-boy it's 20% of the damage that you'd have without the explosive effect, or 32% with max Demo Expert. So all your perks, mods and other damage buffs also increase the explosive damage.
---
For TSEs in the current patch, this 20% appears to be added for each projectile, so you get +40% without Demo Expert. This may also be true for energy weapons with shotgun/splitter barrels.
---
Right, because outright removing a thread with a ~100 comments isn‚Äôt at all stifling.
---
Around watogga is plenty of area to build that's flat, has a ready accessable water supply and is close to those pesky dweller kids that live to throw wild parties with booze and fireworks.
---
A few turrets, some defensive measures. And your set
---
Option 2
---
Twin lakes region, lower level mods same general setup as watogga.
---
Option 3. Just south west of the vault. Is a like it hills on the map. There is a few sopts that are flat and have small bodies if water. Some close to mineral nodes.
---
If water us not an issue . Check out this acid node that's on a ridge that's very flat

Bro if somebody ate me instead of stimpacking while in a boss fight my fist would literally go through my screen (not really, but I'd really consider it for a second lol).
---
Here are my suggestions.
---
In Strength, swap Martial Artist with Bear Arms or the reload perk.
---
Perception is fine.
---
You really do not need Fireproof because not many enemies have fire or explosive attacks.  I would get Rejuvenated in because it gives you a lot more health and AP for being well fed and hydrated.  Good Doggy is really not necessary because food is pretty abundant.  I use Carnivore and just eat all the meat I find.  I suggest allocating that point into Strength.
---
In Charisma, I would bump Lone Wanderer down a rank or two and add Travel Agent.  It is one of those perks that you really do not want to keep swapping in and out.
---
You really do not need Demolition Expert unless you have an Explosive weapon.  Even then you could just alternate between that and Gunsmith.  Heavy Weapons are quite durable unless you are using a Two Shot weapon because I think they degrade faster.  You could max out Batteries Included so you can carry more Fusion Cores.  
---
Max out Adrenaline and make Born Survivor Rank 1.
---
Luck is pretty good.
---
And for Mutations, get Adrenal Reaction.  It is great for additional damage before Born Survivor activates.  The lost health will be mitigated by Rejuvenated and Class Freak.
---
I also suggest checking out Captainoob.  He has some great builds that will help.
---
Power armor synth that uses the built in bleeps and bloops
---
Relative Noob declares shitpost rule is toxic. Admits being a noob. You're a drama queen.
---
I always buy scrappable armor &amp; weapons if they are cheap. At lvl 324 im still missing mods even though im been scrapping since lvl 4 or something. Love rng.
---
Let's help each other) I'll be online at the same time, even a little earlier) psn: Okami-Lxix
---
How much?
---
I thought the stars were commie symbols
---
you need to be minimum level 25 to be able to use that gun according to the wiki

Aa explosive vats cost lmg
---
Nope I can see how you'd think that but, you can actually find them pretty frequently around farm area in the US. Quite a few in West Virginia and Maryland in fact.
---
I cant remember it's in my vendor you're welcome to stop by. My GT is Younq Nasty Man. Q in nasty not a g
---
Damn, I'm realizing that we didn't try too many iterations of items with actual "mask" in the name.
---
Wow.
---
There a vendor who sells a plan for one at Welch Station.
---
BEARS.  IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE SHANK.
---
What do you mean? I'm not storing the topiary cats
---
I love Horde events. It seems a 50/50 coin flip on whether you'll just be in the area and get to kill the boss, or have to search. If you have to search you'll benefit from knowing where static spawns usually are. A Cranberry Bog super mutant horde? Just head to General's Stake House. Scorched Horde? Glass Caverns. You'll every so often travel to an event only to have the horde leader killed by another mob... Just cut the loss and move on. Also don't always instantly kill the boss. If you let it live and kill the other mobs it will spawn more mobs, and they will have a chance to be starred legendaries at a higher level then the boss mob.
---
Wow. That's amazing. What's ur situation? What's ur best guess as to why?
---
It's a weird pattern. Most hordes I jump into are on the east side of the map. The bog and the mire. They usually have the highest level enemies. Although sometimes we get super mutants at level 35 and the robobrain. But the robobrain usually is in the Watoga bldg mining company and the scorched are usually in the shopping center but sometimes the cave west of the steakhouse. Super mutants at the steakhouse. Most other things are roaming. 
---
The search area is a bit annoying.
---
THE OP ISN'T TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMED GATLING LASER PEOPLE
---
A short laser pistol at lv 45 for me deals 51 dmg and has 40 fire rate (no perks, base mods, etc). A level 50 Ultracite laser pistol for me deals 39 dmg and has 50 fire rate (no perks, base mods, etc.) The premise behind ultracite laser pistols/rifles is less damage, but higher fire rate, and I believe it's the same for the ultracite gatling laser.
---
I found someone that can do it for me. But the downside is you will go through some plasma cores a lot faster.
---
Welch, Grafton, I think even Camden Park now.
---
The chainsaw (and all the similar melee weapons: the Drill, the Ripper, and the Mr. Handy Buz Blade) actually does more damage the higher the repair. At 200%, its actually not a bad melee weapon.
---
yo i need that 90% weight reduction so i can carry more trash
---
I give it a minute or two when I jump world's this way I fully disconnect from the last server.
---
Class Freak 3 only removes 75% of the negative effects of the mutation.
---
Er, there‚Äôs a bit of a disconnect here. You‚Äôre not a menace to the wasteland. The most you can do is steal people‚Äôs junk. Big whoop.
---
You‚Äôre a ‚Äúmenace‚Äù to the people just trying to have fun. Otherwise known as being a dick. 
---
I totally understand the raider mindset. I really wanted this game to have immersive pvp. I wanted to be a raider, so much. But you can‚Äôt. All you can do is be a dick. Complete waste of time, and all you accomplish is pissing people off. If something like that is fun for you, then you need to take a look in the mirror and ask yourself why. Because it has nothing to do with Fallout.
---
All of the events give good xp plus whatever kills you get for extra. Just gotta grind away.
---
It's 10% per piece in the curve tables. Without testing, I can't be sure whether this is actually applied, as it's not linked to anything.
---

I‚Äôll add you up then message me whenever I‚Äôm usually on all the time

Read one comment where a guy priced a pie at 9999 and someone bought it. He meant it as a joke but?

‚ÄúDid a lot of damage‚Äù shooting the same target as 5 others? üòÇ sorry but you don‚Äôt do that much damage if you can‚Äôt go solo down there
---
Nevermind.

As the Bob's say in Office Space,
---
We fixed the glitch

Darn it... So Il get rid of that then
---
Nice roll bud.
---
Popularity is clearly all you care about
---
I‚Äôm also on PS4 and I‚Äôll check out Watoga mall although I‚Äôm pretty broke right now I might need to save up for that
---
I had some wooden armor but it got Dutch elm deasease and it died.
---
Totally agree mate why is it in the game as there's nothing worse than take down a high lvl enemy and get this rubbish.
---
What is the best second and third star combinations
---
It‚Äôs like you guys have forgotten this is a post apocalyptic wasteland. Trust no one.
---
The event itself dropped it, like any other event that drop plans.
---
For the second try I got super stimpak plans
---
I agree
---
it's from a scene in the movie slackers
---
Can I join with the pumpkin house one ? thx !

Yes, there is. I belive, the diffuser is less effective.
---
There are 3-4 in the rowboat in the dried up lake bed not too far from New Gad...
---
yes! I thought the same thing!
---
" we all know the psychic power of the televised imaged...."
---
Lots of requests from people on reddit but to my knowledge not even acknowledgement from Bethesda
---
My tse shotgun is working better in this patch so maybe a stealth fix as last patch is was rubbish.
---
Only problem I've had so far with the new patch is I'm still locking up and crashing to desktop.
---
This lever
---
Alas, no.  I also ran the Scan and Repair, but nothing.  Sometimes I'll go an entire session without an overlay crash, and then the next time I log on the first overlay I encounter crashes the game.  I've just been trying to avoid picking locks and reading notes as much as possible.  But sometimes it's unavoidable, especially for quests.  I've never had it happen on a terminal, but I suspect that's because those work differently.
---
As Said above my 2 main Guns are explosive ones... So demo expert is very viable so is fireproof to mitigate any self inflicted explosive damage by accident ( I'm clumsy like that)
---
I tend to only eat dog food hence good doggy. 
---
The martial artist Will be swapped out for something Else, sadly i thought it still worked on the gatling :(
---
I like the gunsmith tho, that 50cal does tend to wear down pretty fast imo. 
---
Travel agent is just a waste in my opinion, yes you can save caps with it but caps aren't really an issue in this game, at least not for me.
---
Does the adrenal increase the damage a lot before born survivor activates?
---
I've gave up doing these quests they are beyond silly.
---
Agreed on the weight perks. But there are not enough points to spec into every weapon fully. You would need 4 trees maxed to make the most out of them. Trying to spec into both rifles and strength builds will always leave pistols suffering and will also make your drops garbage durability unless you are a bloodied unyielding build.
---
Or weapon display racks at CAMP...
---
My first was a 2* Instigating .44 pistol and the 2nd time was a 2* Robot Chest, it‚Äôs very memorable that I forget what kind haha
---
Aw, this makes me sad I'm not on Xbox.  Thanks for sharing it here... you did a great job!  The one little guy on the toilet is my favorite one.
---
Welch is were I got mine, but that was many patches ago.
---
Healing factor only work out of combat, right?
---
I haven't seen a huge difference when engaged in a fight.
---
Yeah I think levers only come at levels 25, 35 and 45
---
You‚Äôre clearly working through some things, so I‚Äôm not going to react to that. 
---
But I want you to know it gets better. 
---
You‚Äôll get through this. [Hang in there.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/SQwzT)
---
Yeah I find that as well which sucks cause rifles are my fav to play with. Thinking about reworking to a pistol build...
---
Nice, I was lucky enough to get a Radium rifle version, eats through Whitesprings. I had to wait and rank up 17 levels before I could use it.
---
This thing wasn't fighting, the other enemies walk passed.
---
sounds like a plan! (Y)
---
This\^ definitely don't forget the sleep bonus. sleep before you do everything. quests, crafting, events. it's free xp.
---
After taking everything in consideration i Will make modifications like this.

Thanks everyone for the feedback.

---
i liked it how it used to be..you used to get a yellow circle on the map to let you know where to search..since the last couple.of weeks theres no circle anymore so its hit and miss..sometimes i join the event and the horde is in the immediate area..other times theres no horde nearby..so with no yellow.circles to search anymore makes it near impossible to complete...god.knows why they took away the yellow.circles.
---
What does it do?
---
You got the choice of revenge at the end of event or live with it. It happens a lot in encryptid event but I guess sometimes ppl may press wrong button LMFAO
---
We can't be far off a stash increase, they can't keep giving us stuff to collect without giving us room to keep it.
---
what do you mean fast travel doesnt work? in what way?
---
On console after 15 attempts i haven‚Äôt mad it down once, I‚Äôve stop trying I‚Äôll wait till next week hopefully they have worked the kinks.
---
Theres loads at top of the world too
---
I love it when you have just died &amp; people jump on your bag &amp; you can see them doing it, at least give them a chance to reload &amp; pick it up
---
Fast travel spawns enemies. Destroying camps is the easiest of has ever bee nb sonce now you can't fight the person kiting enemies.
---
2* would be +1 agility i guess. It would be a small boost but 3* "harder to detect while sneaking" thats a rare but good one.
---
On top of also experiencing the disconnects, since the update I can no longer place my C.A.M.P blueprint - back to the "needs support" nonsense
---
I figured- they definitely should though
---
@ u/Bethesda (?)
---
I figured, they should, I‚Äôd be awesome
---
You mean adding a scorched receiver, the prime doesn‚Äôt add a star
---
I've found if the hexagon showing the event moves slightly on the map the boss is in the event where it is. If after watching for a minute or so it doesn't move you will have to search for the horde. I found that looking st the locations and thinking about the general enemies that spawn there helps with the search. For example if the event is in the Forrest and for ghouls. If it shows the nuke plant fair ground etc then they are more than likely in the nuke plant as the fairground spawn scorched..
---
I don't want to move my CAMP for fear of never being able to place it again. I fee you.
---
You sure say "mate" a lot.  Like, more than any of my British/Aussie friends.
---
Half of these are wrong as its says no chance to get long night vision scope for handmade and i have it as a permanant mod for handmades
---
Always been available, I've also got plenty of recievers from scorch beasts.
---
Ok thanks mate
---
Super cool glitch where you fast travel to a camp and end up under it üòé
---
Naw but other than that the game is pretty decent in my opinion
---
When I look for a new camp location, I look for resource nodes in the wild (outside of workshop areas) . I‚Äôm currently set up on and iron deposit (steal for days) but I‚Äôve also had lead, junk and acid. A quick google of non workshop deposits will find you a bunch of jpegs of the Wv 76 map with colored dots noting location and types of resources.
---
There are lots. Just pick  one you like and go from there.
---
This is spot on. Had this issue lots and this triggers the part of mission where you power up the generator. If you try to do this with out the reading the document you wont get the password to the terminal.
---
That must be why the sulphur spring cures diseases lol.
---
How many creatures did survive when you got it?
---
nice
---
Instigating or Bloodied super sledge with faster swing speed and +1 strength.
---
Did you get your pic? You gave me 30 waters lol. I scraped my camera by mistake but happy to help someone get thier pic for the week.
---
There‚Äôs an event at the land view lighthouse that is successful grants a times xp bonus.
---
coming !
---
Grognacks axe Ss anti Armor or Bloodied
---
"Assassin sentinel armor" i think we know who the real griefer here is.
---
Maybe work on a bit of a different build. Use some perks like gladiator and iron fist. And try a deathclaw gauntlet or a power fist.
---
It depends on your build. For example if you have a bloodied build then a deathclaw gauntlet with swing speed and +1 strength will do insane damage.
---
Proceeds to complain how his survival experience is ruined because of nerfs. Lmao
---
Didnt they patch that out?
---
Fully agree, that's what I do and it's amazing. Power fist outside of PA, super sledge while wearing PA.
---
My bloodied swing speed pickaxe is even better
---
Kishishishishi
---
Very true. Good to have the option to switch back and forth between 2 and 1 handed weapons
---
I'd take Quad for the Lever Action instead of one of the others.
---
Guess we'll have to wait until night or server hop.
---
it will be night on the server pretty soon, so I guess we can just wait here by the house in the mean-time heh :)
---
Yep ! :)
---
Oh hell no. F Diablo RNG!!!
---
I ran into a Sheepsquash fighting an albinos deathclaw and a scorchbeast. The screen was shaking hard.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't know. I only recently came back to the game. I stopped playing when duping first started being a real issue.
---
But one of my characters [still] uses a chainsaw in melee and does pretty well despite having zero perks. I just assumed nothing had changed with the weapon.
---
yep! :) thank you very much for the help. I wish I could trade you a camera so you could get the challenge too though. I remember when the camera first came out, I could actually trade it to my friend but they've fixed it since then :/
---
Gladiator doesn't effect power fist and deathclaw gauntlet anymore
---
Funny enough, I fucking learned that like a month ago and I was all "Wow that's going to help so much!" then promptly forgot until someone mentioned it again yesterday lol.

---
But they are so easy to find. Unless you are looking for a particular one for the scout challenges...
---
I have gotten one disconnect/crash since launch. Its really the luck of the draw for everyone.
---
I got my plans at Grafton station. Pretty sure it is level 25 for them.
---
Wallpaper please for the brick interior
---
You must be joking. You think every single person with that armour greifs? You think nobody that trades has an interest in defending themselves? You think pvp is a greifer only sport?

The dried up river bed leading down to Charleston should be big enough and flat enough.

I mistakenly cured my disease earlier :P So I'm coming back to your server soon, just getting a new disease on another server first :P
---
You guys saved my ass from a schorched beast! Even. Best i get back to my part of the forest.
---
sure ! I'll wait here .
---
That's a damn fine use for them. What console are you on?
---
heh yeah that one flies around creating havoc up there all the time :P Was about time it got what it deserved! Thanks for tagging along for so long though :)
---
Nothing like wasting your life on subreddits dedicated to games you don't play.
---
Great build. Orginal layout and with a nice view.
---
Still hoping you'll post, friend!
---
Dosimeter. I only know that because of subtitles...
---
thank you for your time, and for the help :) I remember you now from when you helped me out earlier as well, with the beer-hat challenge hah. Anyways, see you around!
---
...Pretty much any executioners/instigating/furious/bloodied 2h melee weapon.  All rise is one of the few half decent gimme weapons, but all told its' pretty meh compared to any number of other legendary weapons.
---
It's called trouble shooting. What's variables are different between two if one works and the other doesn't. I don't know if it can be the case of not but I do know that the problem isn't effecting everyone so what's causing that? The most obvious answer would be the the first thing that's different between one Xbox versus another and that would be their ISP so that's where you would start if you were trying to figure out the problem.
---
Figured it out. Hold down the enter build mode button and you get the pop up to conest

I've gone with my cousin only and we did pretty well. We only lost because of the level 100 Sheepsquatch. Sorry Mr. Know-it-all

Fellow Ps4 user here, this is what happened when I downloaded the new update file. I logged in, it took a couple of seconds for everything to load in so that was nice. In my inventory I have all the required Flux Stables expect the Violet one ready to make a Rads Contamination Machine. Was heading to a location and I unfortunately jumped off from a mountain thinking it wasn‚Äôt so far down so I died. Came back, ran to grab my junk successfully and I kid you not seconds later I got ‚ÄúThe Servers No Responding‚Äù message. The only thing I thought was how lucky I was to have gotten my junk in time. Went to a new sever and I checked my inventory to make sure I had everything, saw that I was drastically lowered in weight and it turns out I did lose all my Flux Stables. World hopped for several hours for a week to finally gather everything I needed for those materials only to lose em on the new update. Thanks Bethesda for the new update, the dungeons okay
---
Sounds like a good way to sell DLC to me.   I know they said all DLC to be free.  But they cannot survive on that model.
---
i can‚Äôt even do the event. every single attempt to go down the elevator my game freezes.  i‚Äôve tried over and over to get down there but i can‚Äôt.  is anyone else having this issue?
---
I want wall mounted turrets.
---
There are loads. There's the flannel shirt and jeans, t-shirt and slacks, shirt with braces and slacks for a start. I find them in houses, in shops, in lockers all across the map.
---
Nice tie in to existing terminal in camp.  This is great idea.
---
for day to day use imo nothing beats ss or instigating effect on melee weapons
---
Is the flannel shirt and jeans a underarmor?
---
I dont know where to look for such items. I rarely run across 2 star Legendary monsters let alone 3 star.
---
Yep. I rock that with leather armor and a dirty ranger hat.
---
They don't need to buff the stats they just need to add the rest of the legendary attach points as it only has 1 while all other legendary armors have 5
---
I would if they could get the programming bugs under control.
---
Yeah, it's not like FO4 in that regard, thankfully. You can scrap and stash and still repair/cook/craft whatever whereever.
---
I really don't know. I only wear the other outfits for photos as I stomp about in power armour and a BoS Knight suit the rest of the time.
---
You should be able to build in a team's camp, but you can't build Atom shop items.
---
Can you imagine being stagger locked by a yaoi gui in vr?
---
2k
---
I will check if anyone has bought my screws yet.
---
How much do you want to pay?
---
I wear tshirt and slacks you can find them at whitespring in the spa room (inside that main crafting strip theres a spa with robot atendants and in one of the rooms theres a white tsirt and slacks.
---
Shame that instead of developing cool mutations they developed cancer or an acute case of death instead...
---
I like power armor myself currently rocking the t51 nuka paint set. but because i am built around power armor and laser i just have tshirt and pants on under.
---
How do you shut off the robot replicators? Is it with the code you get from the engineer computer?
---
Geiger counter.
---
See u soon ! ;D
---
Yeah the beards in game are so wirey I'd prefer a more compact and smooth beard.
---
I've got a bloodied. Explosive -90%weight 45submachinegun yesterday :)
---
AAE
---
Yeah my build is power armour too, also works as I have a certain aesthetic for my main character.
---
I recently had a bunch of power armor dropped on the ground - I was making full suits out of a bunch of partials - anyway I froze up couldnt move - pressed escap it took me to the map and there were people on it - I thought they had to be friends so i was friend inviting everyone but no one was accepting. now I know I could have just made note of a few names and hopped right on back.
---
I would like half height wood panel interior for the brick walls to go with the bar set already in the atom shop.
---
I did play it to level 127 before finally waking up to the non ending grind. I keep getting amusing notifications on my phone about it and decided to comment on this one in a weak moment.
---
I want ALL bulk items to have a weight reduction. I did the math again a few nights ago and lead and aluminum are still the only things worth bulking for weight management purposes.
---
It's not easy when you have hundreds of materials that you can manage only with Pack Rat card. At least I store the rarest materials and travel only with hundreds of common materials
---
It's the hard life of a serial hoarder

its from below and from the back. It was fully furnished with 4 Beds / all work stations a 4x Man Power Armor Station Bay and 2 Missles Defense Turrets wich you could acsess via a stairway to the roof. The Ground had a 4x Mk 2 Turret Defense system with a check in terminal Area wich serves as a Loading Bay and a Fusion Generator.

Sometimes worth just going for the 2 Star trade rather than saving up for the 3 Star!

If i see you're not cooperating to the event ,you get eaten as soon as you hit the ground.
---
DO NOT BUY IT! Just play the new Arktos event! The Endboss has a high chance of dropping it! This is clearly some one who wants to feed on people who dont know this.
---
I was so close to buying those letters but saw how awful they were on someones base. So glad I didnt. I think alot of the issue is the is too many broken bulbs. There should be a version for one totally lit up.
---
&gt;I'm surprised people are still trying to pvp in adventure mode. That's not what it's for. Go in survival mode to pvp,
---
Careful, whenever I say that someone always comes up with the "counter" involving the mechanics for workshops
---
I sell steel all the time. Goes really fast at 20 caps a bundle. Cloth, wood, glass, doesn't sell.
---
I'm sure adhesive, gears and oil would sell as well but I haven't tried those yet.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a no star large deathclaw will do more damage than an All Rise.
---
This is an amazing story my friend. Lol. Happy adventuring!
---
Those are primary stats. You get one of them on a weapon. My point is, the only thing All rise has going for is the reduced weight and 5% bonus damage from the +str. 
---
Executioners does +50% bellow 40% health, which is better total damage boost. It's the weakest on this list, to my mind, and still a solid boost to over-all damage, especially against bigger mobs. 
---
Instigating does double damage if the enemy is at full health, which means if you're the first to hit a thing, you can one shot kill many enemies with a decent build. 
---
Furious does more damage each consecutive hit. The bigger they are, they harder they fall. 
---
Bloodied does more damage, the lower your health. This is one of the biggest reward/highest risk legendary affects out there, but with a proper build you can do thousands of damage per hit.
---
Depends,if you're really doing your part it won't be the wrong button. At least i don't vare for your junk.
---
I'm setting up a garage myself but I'm still building a base of inventory - I am level 240 plus - I dont really need  a ton of caps - no need for grinding queen - no need for new legendary weapons, don't care to make any alts.  so I adopted power plants and farm fusion cores. Anyway when my fusion cores get full they also fill up my vendors so I needed something to do on the side for when im only maintaining a single power plant. met a brand new level 15 guy and I wanted to have some armor for him. got to thinking a power armor library of leveling power armors would be cool, like just lending them out peeps can return on the honor system - on my vendors i could sell the painted nuka sets etc. i dont expect much traffic so just one set of nuka and one set of quantom.
---
10 000 is even more round... oh, so round...
---
Thank you for replying anyways! There's a lot about the system i still dont get. I was getting full on greifed by a bloodied sniper today who didnt want my workshops. Just a cap farmer. He didnt even do his first defend missions. I lost the workshop, then it went unowned a few minutes later. 
---
Can workshops be contested during a defend event? And can i conest the contestor the same way? With the build button? What happens in the event of a stale mate where we both just camp out waiting for each other to come out of stealth? Does the workshop just stay in limbo?
---
Same issue with laser guns. The laser bolts just don't go where i'm aiming at.
---
"sleepy4792" I'll be on tomorrow. Let me know what time is good for you? I can spare 3 or 4 bulk screws.
---
Then what‚Äôs with your original post? If you did so much damage then there shouldn‚Äôt have been a problem
---
Mine is in the shop.
---
I wanted more people to play with? Jesus you're a real stick in the mud
---
All of it.
---
Read that the "naked in rad storm" also count while wearing a hazmat in PA.
---
I'm with you there. I mean it was fun the at the first days of nukashine taking a photomode pic because it kinda fitted about the passed out theme.
---
But...now. It's just how to get as much as objectives in one challenge as possible.
---
And if they put as much effort, creativity and care into bug fixes instead of how to make the challenges nearly impossible specific we would have a game no one would moan around. 00.2$
---
I'm on PC and the game crashed yesterday. I was playing alone but on the same server as a few friends. When the game started up again I joined them again and I still had the workshop I claimed before crashing. Are they preparing for the ability to get right back in?
---
After 3-4pm GMT will be good for me.
---
Its not urgent, I'm scrapping weapons for mods and its just frustrating that whether intentional or not, a good supply of screws has gone from the game
---
During the phase where you load the feed troughs, you can use a code with a keypad very near the initialization console...(Not posting it because I don't want to deal with spoiler tags and you can find it easily searching the Reddit), to enter the basement. You can then access a computer terminal in the lower, central part of the basement. It allows you to copy a shutdown code. Ten, returning to the console you use to initialize the event, you can enter the code, which shuts down all the robot replicators. Totally worth it. No more assaultrons or sentrybots are generated for the rest of the event. :)
---
So, first time on acid then?
---
Want me to build some walls for you friendo? I can be on in an hour.
---
All 3.
---
If I remember correct, all 3 was rank 1.
---
Yes! Every round I‚Äôm selling, minus mini nukes, are 1c a pop. I usually hang around my base and those with mics that ask about a bulk discount usually get it.
---
Junk is easy to find. I don‚Äôt need to steal it from someone else.
---
But it does reduce weight, by letting you sell items that vendor-bots won't normally buy. Once you sell it, it reduces it's weight by a whopping 100%!
---
But seriously, bulking isn't for storage space, it's to make stuff like wood, steel and other worthless materials able to be sold, that's it.
---
I keep only about 50 of each type of material and sell off the rest, with only a few exceptions like screws, and I've rarely ever been left wanting.
---
Seriously guys, you don't need to keep 600 steel and 500 springs at all times, hoard intelligently.
---
The possum miner where do you check in at hornwright industrial ?
---
PC
---
you are talking to a veteran workshop defender sir - I will give brief everything you need to know guide. 
---
1. when you build stay under budget when the junk costs are displayed in green the shop is paying for it when the junk turns white it means its coming from your stash. you should stay under budget because if a player attacks or the server crashes you have only lost a few cops and not heavily invested in it. 
---
2. yes you can be contested while defend in fact they like that more cause youre distracted and easier to sneak up on. 
---
3. leave as soon as you claim and defend you can no longer be cross mapped sniped but if your in the contest zone you're still a loot pinata with a sever combat disadvantage. 
---
4. stealth before fast traveling to your shop to gather resources. resources tend to fill up in about 24 to 34 minutes. go away let them get full then sneaky sneak back in to harvest. don't set a strict pattern show up early show up late. be unpredictable if possible. 
---
5. this is debatable but I never lock any resource nodes. I'm rich for one thing and dont mind sharing, but also when I need something I get tempted to forcibly take a shop when there's a lock on it. and I am a nice dude. There's a lot of people who are less nice, who can take your shop and cost you caps who wouldn't if the lock wasn't in the way. the people who are going to kill you and take your shop don't care about locks one way or the other. I think of it this way - the only people deterred by lock's are friendly nice young new players who either can't or wont steal from you. hell I want them to have stuff if they need it.
---
Thanks for the heads up ! 
---
You saved my atoms.
---
All I see is a blank sheet of cells. Is it supposed to do anything?
---
Iaming with the gatling gun hahaha
---
Yup everytime.
---
I miss the winterized paint scheme for the T51 for nostalgic reasons. Its why I bought the pale rider skin. Closest I could get.
---
When you're out of combat, it heals you. I don't mean like regenerating armor, I mean it takes you from 1hp to full in a couple of seconds. The only heals you ever need are a few stimpaks in case a fight goes bad
---
Yeah only out of combat
---
bed next to the fusion generator OOF
---
AA handmade with faster fire rate, maybe weight reduction.
---
I don't care for two shot or explosive.
---
it is legit called Thomas the Dank Engine. My phone auto corrected it.
---
i was getting a plan most times that i did the event but i haven't had any for a couple of weeks now, seems like they might have been removed from the loot table when they changed the PA spawn rate chance
---
The first weapon i was given was a bloodied explosive vats enhanced railway rifle
---
Thanks so much!! You've been a huge help! I dont usually take workshops, but i was low on power cores and wasn't getting any bites on my lfg post for them. 
---
Do yoy usually defwnd the workshop when it's being contested? Or do you find that it's pvpers that just wanna rack up kills?
---
oh also the mechanics of the death payouts. the most anyone can get from killing you is 50 caps. 
---
it cost 25 to 35 caps to contest - it cost them some to fast travel to your workshop. 
---
essentially they get very little profit for killing you unless you get angry and keep coming back. 
---
bloodied builds can oneshot anything and anyone including each other. its stupid and lame pvp but thats a seperate rant. anyway the point being dont go back. if they kill you easy again the deck is stacked you cant win just dont give them profit. server hop and retake it's cheaper.
---
ya and it sucks been like this since the nukashine update for me at least
---
?
---
I dont think you fully grasp how odds work
---
I think fried fog crawler needs it
---
Aaah... thankyou for this explanation.
---
The sight you can add is really broken and not centred at all
---
Don't fast travel to it. Walk from a nearby location.
---
Glad I could ! I wasn't so lucky xD haha
---
I play 1 - 16 hours a day. I have 600+ hours played. Game is boring to me only because i have over 100lbs of legendaries i can't scrap. 
---
I will do daily limit of legendaries in 2hours, if i won't grind them. If i do, it  will take me only 30minutes to get those 150scrips. So i am limited because fallout76 comunity is mostly non-gamers, good job comunity.
---
Although i agree, just gonna say that the camara has literally only been out 1 month, so its not endless for months, its endless for 1 month
---
I live smack in the middle of L.A., between Bev Hills, USC and Venice beach... so im probably sharing with one of the densest internet usage numbers anywhere. Maybe time of day will turn out to be relevant(?)
---
Don't forget the two doing 69 at Vault-tec agricultural research
---
Oh poops. Good luck on your search, friend.
---
You lose
---
All your Junk
---
A small percentage of your aid (randomly determined) (Stack the list with Spoiled Meat and and Dirty water)
---
Supposed to lose 1/4 level in Caps, maxed at 50 Caps - apparently bugged.
---
Buying bobbleheads, magazines, and other items required for challenges doesn't register. You have to find them in the world. I wasted quite a few caps on magazines before I figured that out.
---
I was doing the world challenge where you have to consume all the bobble heads so it doesn't matter how you obtain them :)
---
shame you're on X-Box I am on PC but power plants are my bread and butter. I use vampiric laser gat and power armor and jump-jets. I live in workshops farming power cores. even at level 240 in some fully decked out power armor I still get one and two shot by any serious pvpers.  If I am in the shop and they attack I try to defend myself and succeed about 30% of the time. if I am crossmap and they take the shop I finish whatever I was doing and just server hop to get a new plant. I am not playing the game to make their experience more gratifying or provide them with income. I know I suck at pvp I am not built for it. I am built for laser pew pew fun and power armor sexiness. odds are if I show up I will give them 50 caps. I cant take a yard and have the turrests up and ready in under a minute and my caps go to the workbench instead of an assholes pockets. so yep server hop and start fresh for me.
---
I was casualy playing, and collecting legendaries i got on my way. Took me two hours to get those 150scrips. Since legendary machine release i collected 100lbs of legendaries i can't scrap due to daily limit.
---
Should i throw them away, because some of you are lowbies or noobs? Cool....
---
The ONE fucking thing you think they'd do... is save your place on the server for about a minute, so you could log back in &amp; resume, right? THAT would change everything. As it is, i never bother with workshops bcuz I'll lose it all with a bit anyhoo.
---
If we‚Äôre talking purely cosmetic pets, I want an irradiated mud crab from Skyrim. That would be kickass.
---
Everyone seems to say there are so many legendary spawns in the burrows.. I must have shit luck. I do a run around there almost daily and if I‚Äôm lucky I find 1 or 2 but usually no stars üòÖ
---
So i have to throw legendaries away, because you think it would be boring to scrap them? what? i collect more legendaries than is daily scrip limit when i am not grinding.
---
I think if they removed the caps rewards from adventure mode for pvp that would again make survival seem viable for pvpers, the fact is in reality that it makes no sense to kill someone for 6 caps in survival when you can make 50 caps in adventure mode whilst using the same amount of ammo/stims etc. All players that like to pvp are doing, is trying to get the best value for there kills and honestly I dont blame them, I feel in a way its Bethesda themselves that have instigated this issue just by the senseless cap pay out between the two modes. I dont pvp myself, never even seen a survival server but I do completely get why people avoid it and just farm players in adventure. The 1st week of survival beta I didn't encounter any pvp in adventure and the reason why is that you made tonnes more caps on survival so who wanted to waste there time farming folks in adventure.
---
So what should i do with 100lbs of legendraies i collected in last few days?
---
Here is my attempt at Sarah Lyons from Fallout 3
---
 [https://rpt2691.imgur.com/all](https://rpt2691.imgur.com/all)
---
I think I'll do the same from now on. I went down in 3 shots from a bloodied auto handmade tonight. Single tapped me. I have all these defense cards and great armour and none of them mean anything. I think at this point in the games pvp mechanics, its bloodied or don't play. Especially when it comes to workshops. Appreciate the advice very much!
---
Unless they‚Äôve changed it, the number of people doesn‚Äôt affect the amount of health that the SBQ starts with.
---
I would also like to use the an ingame keyboard for prices on the console because the slider has some stupid acceleration when you want to increase a price.
---
oh in event of a stalemate - the resource generators keep producing for quite awhile even with no one owning it. there's a timer but if the turrets are defending the resource nodes correctly you can farm a good bit from an un-owned shop. and since you don't own it no one can snipe you.
---
It is SO GOOD.  I can‚Äôt help but think of the game when I watch it but it‚Äôs gritty and real and amazing.
---
&gt;!Buildable robots are in the works based on what I've seen in the game files and the last icon at the bottom of the roadmap hints at it as well. Whether they will be companions or not is undetermined. I've seen camp waitstaff and autominer robots in the main .esm so far.!&lt;
---
We want to decide if we want the wall one side or another side. I.e I want a house which looks from the outside like a white house.
---
Hell yes!would buy it again if they remake for next gen xbox:)
---
Its been that way for a long time.  I think it has to do with enemies being too close.  Like when you go up to a wall, you sort of put your weapon aside, but its not supposed to do that with the enemies.
---
I mean, the fire fighters and the plant workers looked like ghouls later in the Moscow hospital,
---
Without having the benefits of being a ghoul tho.
---
The number of people fighting the SBQ has *always* affected the amount of damage needed to kill her. Always. This is why it's seen as poor form to come, tag the SBQ and hide.
---
Fuck I'd even make do with lego walls...
---
If you really don't like it and want a refund. Go submit a ticket to Bethesda ! I'm sure you'll get your atoms back.
---
Wrong sub, go post in r/Fallout if you want people to try to change your mind...
---
... by insulting you and talking endlessly about "MTX", "P2W" and "nylon/canvas bags".
---
There's a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148) for that. It makes things sooo much better. [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) is really great too.
---
&gt; I'll jerk to your tears.
---
And suddenly a bigger shithead arrives.
---
Indeed!. You can use the shoulder buttons to increment it a bit, but it's still too large a gap for me.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbuz2r/comment/eklpjg7
---
You are incorrect.
---
Ooh, that‚Äôs a good build though, but it‚Äôs hard to weigh between group damage, stealth and initial damage. 
---
Do you prioritize stealth, adrenaline or 60% standard base damage?
---
A lot of people are hoarding their scrap. I don't think there's anything more frustrating than trying to do something and find out you're missing something.
---
you can counter bloodied with top end legendary armor's some how but if you're a power armor user its just not possible - with armor ignore of at least 45 % half of several thousand damage is still far more than the health pool can be built to - that's IF you max our for health pool.  This is the first game I've ever not pvped in. now that I'm not losing 200 plus caps per death I find I enjoy trying to defend that one time at least now. one loss they gain 10 caps 20 caps at most? its funny to me because if they're that focused that character sucks at the rest of fallout. no quality of life perks, always weight managing, always hungry, always thirsty, always dying. seriously I dont mind giving them 10 caps profit for all the effort they go through to be a douchebag.  200 plus caps was a bit much though that used to piss me off.
---
Dual wield pistols please

Yeah, not quite the 'setting shop in Goodneighbour' kind...

Thanks to them I don't have to eat everything with a side serving of potassium iodide though...

Don't Frown! I just happened upon your CAMP and it was amaaaaazing to be able to look out the 'eyes' of your AT-AT and see my honest lil CAMP just up the road by the Nuka-Cran sign. TBH I have no idea how you got that thing in under the CAMP limit. It's HUUUUGE! You should pat yourself on the back for a job well done.
---
&gt; keep getting code pieces then let them expire.
---
You don't need the code pieces, just the decoded code, which you can get from https://nukacrypt.com/
---
Eh, whats a little more radiation?
---
I just want to be able to delete items from my camp without it telling me the mess I made is connected to something else
---
I wnet in with a low level. Maybe that makes dif
---
Very true and much needed, especially as it was in previous games
---
yes please - also can you delete the 75 extra horn rite security keys that I looted on accident by pressing r. or you know allow me the option of deleting duplicates.
---
I see that it's 2 stars, would it be a better idea to farm for 2 stars instead of 3? I know it's more efficient, but my greedy little fingers want the third star so bad
---
They fixed that -- it was, unfortunately, a bug.
---
I unhooked mine from power wire because I was at caps max and noticed later it auto emptied itself. It did it again when a power conduit connected to it was destroyed. It's survived plenty of server hops and crashes so I dunno what triggers it if not that.
---
Ive been hoarding scrap to make 10 of the weapon im scrapping, plus 50 of each resource as a back up.
---
Nothing worse that needing to repair a shotgun to find youve got no springs
---
Exactly, they complain about how many items a server can handle, but give us like 18 extra copies of some keys...
---
My bloodied shotgun hits better now after the patch it used to have 700 per shot and did almost nothing damage wise and yesterday it was at 250 and was killing enemy's left right and centre.
---
your so right cause sentinel assassin wasnt the most broken thing next too TSE builds prenerf üòè
---
Guess you didnt read the part about adventure mode which means he reciprocated the attack (if thats even true) its not like the pvp in fo 76 is dominated by griefers with duped sentinel assassins gear or anything but hey glad to see people with it crying about dying in pvp now. The poetic justice is outstanding
---
T51 has great ballistic damage resistance and it is cheaper to repair than the x01, I'm not 100% sure but I think the ballistic resistance of the t51 outranks the t60, the disadvantage though is the radiation resistances in a t51 are around 100 lower than a t60 or a x01. I use t60 for the majority just because I save on springs come repair time and its overall balanced across the resistances.
---
So annoying, that people don't get it right. It's not that complicated.
---
&gt;  did manage to get 10 or so of each from the ghouls inside the burrows
---
How?  They're not in the irradiated zone so they won't drop fluids'n'mass.
---
Photo looks brilliant :) I got all the skins to do exactly this picture I haven't got around to it yet though too busy taking pictures of a thousand animals for my badges!
---
Wrong. With the talons mutation and how adrenal works fist weapons with bloodied do the most dmg in game. Check it out for yourself

I got a bloodied .50 cal machine gun with exploding bullets the other night!
---
Shhh... if you give the game away it will become even harder to find fibre optics.
---
Well, that blows. Still, though, my chainsaw does still seem to be doing decent damage. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yea this is a must !
---
If you wait long enough the meat pile will spawn sometimes so you can loot it.
---
this happens near walls, railings and basically anything that can clip into you.  targeting the server motherboard thingies in the silo it happens all the time. not when I'm shooting things in the open but those panels specifically. 
---
yup yup see it happening get away from rails walls and such you'll be good again. and yeah using the aiming option is good with heavy guns I didn't get that guy either :) really helps to be crouched,  aimed and hitting scorched way off in the distance with ammo conservation.
---
I think we‚Äôre talking around the same thing
---
It's so frustrating that these are literally already in the game from Fallout 4, they just need to package it and shove it on the Atom shop
---
Dude. You're coming off super salty. I don't know you. You don't know me. Any time sent assasin gets mentioned there's always someone like you that just turns any discussion into "sent asassin is bad. If you have it, you're a bad guy. I hope bad things happen to you." Chill dude. This post isn't about sent asassin. You're taking it there because i don't know why.
---
Your right lol misread that xD
---
Keep stuff like plastic, aluminium, screws, springs etc and sell them on here. When I get to 500 plastic, I list it on here for 1k and it sells every single time.
---
He was saying how it‚Äôs so strong that it will get nerfed eventually in his opinion. So enjoy it now while it‚Äôs op.
---
No worries, it‚Äôs early / late lol
---
Yea I was wondering why suddenly everyone had this as their pic.
---
And people have surprisingly been buying 5.56 for 1c each from my vendor aswell.
---
I hit my sell to npc vendor cap daily - anything I accumulate when I cant go to robot vendor goes to my vendor - I sell all ammos and junk for 1c i consider it a temproray holding area untill my robots reset. 
---
about once daily someone will show up and buy a few k work of ammos or just. I would say it adds 1 to 3 k to my income consistantly.
---
I buy ammo for 1c sometimes and I buy junk. If screws etc are at 2 each I'll buy if I need them. If steel is 1-1.5 each I'll buy that too!
---
Oh ok, I got it
---
Nah I‚Äôm not using Bloodied it‚Äôs too boring
---
I had this exact discussion with a few buddies,
---
They asked me to categorize what type of game this is and honestly I couldn‚Äôt.
---
It‚Äôs not an RPG,
---
It‚Äôs really not a survival game,
---
It‚Äôs not exactly an MMO,
---
Certainly not a looter shooter,
---
It‚Äôs this weird social influence game with mobile game/Facebook game vibes all over the place.
---
This game is basically a post  apocalyptic Tourist simulator.
---
I was thinking this too. I got a bunch of useless 3 stars and one 3 star 50 cal mg with exploding damage. 1 good out of like 7 bad.  And then I did 2 2 stars and they were a quad harpooner and assault rifle with exploding bullets. Me personally I will probably do 2 star ranged and 3 star armors.
---
Nope that's not what I said. I said it's boring to just go round farming! You need to enjoy the game, if all you want to do is go round looking for 3 star legendaries to hope for great weapons and armor i think that's not only boring, but a little tedious. 
---
If you're finding lots of great weapons and armor by "falling over" so many great items. I cant see the problem there either. There has to be limits to stuff otherwise it would just cause huge exploitation. (Not that there isnt already)
---
I'm simply saying, enjoy the game, and don't treat it like a mobile game where it becomes almost routine. Live a little! That's all. My opinion to making it less boring. :)
---
Nope. It just givesyou extra regular meat. I had thesame thought.
---
If a video game is making you ABOUT GODDAMN SICK AND FUCKING TIRED OF HAVING TO REDO YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING CAMP why don't you act like a fucking man about it, and go take a walk, or get laid.
---
My first encounter was I went to help a low level and it turned out he was being attacked by a sheepsquatch. This was in the middle of the road and the nearest landmark was Abbie's bunker so I believe it was random. 
---
2nd encounter was in the middle of the road again just South of the General's steakhouse in the bog. Fighting mole miners of all creatures. Again random.
---
Perception is strange, i have 31 perception and when fooling around with pistols i use concentraded fire for the headshots but a lot of shots miss even thouhg i one shot most basic enemies
---
Yep, just wait for it.
---
similer experience. got killed, trying to get back to wotoga, at the bridge.REspawned at the station,and i've 3 scorch beast, dead and lootable.
---
now i have dropped one out by the mine which went awol, hmmmmm.they all had the same loot.
---
got my junk bag back and returned, gone
---
All rise is pure shit compared to what you gan get üòÅ
---
I can give 700 5mm or 400 .308 for 200 caps i guess
---
Mate, that must have been such a warm and snuggly feeling, seeing that drop. Good health for using it!
---
Oh wait, it's Bloodied - so I guess, bad health for using it? :D
---
I figured that but im not getting anything better yet.
---
P R O T E C T A N D S E R V E
---
Yep. Do you think that the developers are going to fix this issue at somepoint? Have they acknowledged the existence of this bug?
---
It can take some time , i could help you out but i got rid of most melee. Do you follow r/market76? You should be able to find a decent 2* to start with. 
---
Bloodied/Instigating is a good choice with swingspeed
---
Yeah posted it yesterday already. Seems all translations are messed up since last patch.
---
*takes notes*
---
Suddenly feeling hungry.
---
Are you on PC? If so I have a few casual outfits I could make you.
---
Got it. Just thought one violent night beer has some special effect i missed
---
Worst thing is that almost all objectives of the scout challenges are bugged too. Not to mention all the spoilers...
---
I just recently got a 2 shot handmade and I always need 5.56 now lol I blow threw a few thousand bullets a day grinding events
---
I will get 150 scrips in hour by doing basic events. Then every legendary i pick take my inventory space. Since legendary machine release I did collect 100lbs of legendaries i can't scrap, because i get every day over limit. And i am not playing more than 3hours daily as i used to, also i am not grinding legendaries, i just run around......
---
It is hard to enjoy something where i have to throw "endgame loot" away, because other players are noobs, or what and don't meet any legendary mobs....
---
Greeting to the people with lvl 200+ who stand on top of the food machines and do completely nothing to fill them up.
---
Clean everything! We should be able to get a choice to build the broken/post-apocalypse versions or a new clean/repaired version. 
---
I would be happy if they were more expensive or cost more materials and were separate plans. I want to rebuild the post-apocalyptic wasteland, also I think there‚Äôs something eerie about coming across a  perfectly preserved house in the middle of the woods after a nuclear war.
---
wasn't planning on joining them.   and no,  i'm not raider material either.
---
Well, what exactly do you expect? Not everythingu
---
Perception gives you vats range and increases how effectively your character spots enemies.
---
Agility gives you resistances and action points.
---
Luck is used in various vats related formulas and with looted item durability related formulas. If you have 34 luck, one formula (Four Leaf Clover) is giving vastly better results than 33 luck does, which potentially makes this +1 luck the best roll for a new armor piece for certain people at 33 luck.
---
What rewards did you, I mean everyone else earn you?
---
I think this would be a nightmare to code, but I'm with you in thinking something needs to be done. Those one-hit guys screw even the other, more courteous, high level players, and just end up breeding more of them
---
you can somehow get a similar item from behemoths, called "behemoth rock smash" or something along those lines. I saw somebody selling one for 25k caps in their machine. does anyone know how to get these?
---
Perception is one of the three most important special stats when it comes to PvP, tied with agility and luck. Its also crucial to counter one of PvP metas, sneak.
---
 Ammo is hit and miss, but I sell junk easy. I‚Äôve been selling screws for 10 caps a pop and been raking in the caps. I throw up a few hundred at a time and they never last more than 3 hours. Screws, ultracite, and titanium are the only things I sell high but only because people buy them so quick.
---
Steel goes easy at about 5-8 caps a bulk but i usually have so much that I‚Äôll sell it lower to just get rid of it.
---
Everything else goes for about 5-20 a bulk with some exceptions like glass which is worthless, or wood.
---
I primarily sell to get around the vendor cap limit so I‚Äôm not looking to make tons. I usually hit that cap first thing when I hop on so anything vending machine sold is just a bonus. I don‚Äôt waste time or space selling high when I can move volume and free up my stash. I make 2-3K caps a day on just my scrap.
---
A tip I‚Äôd give is to find a good location and sell variety of items so people come for what they‚Äôre looking for and leave with something else. A few weapons, armor, and a few dozen stim packs seem to keep people coming.
---
This is high level millennial.
---
I participate so i'm valuable.
---
Inb4 people bitch about that because they aren‚Äôt how people wanted them to be
---
Because VATS doesnt home your bullets. It only forces reticle on targets. But not completely. So when you keep moving, it can lose VATS focus. The only way to fix it is probably to have VATS completely lock up your character's movement. Or pretty overhaul so that the "top" body can move and aim independently from the "legs".
---
Even prior to the change, I gave up on pvp. Too many cheaters or bugs. I really don't know which. There was a patch note regarding sent/cav/assassin stacking improperly and making players invulnerable, melee has never registered properly, and then there are cheaters. 
---
I got into it with a guy attacking my workshop. He killed me before I even saw him. I had seen him coming on the map and prepared, but he caught me off guard anyways. I came back, used a stealthboy, and got a solid hit on him. 3/4 of his health in one hit. 
---
The next six melee attacks did nothing. I caught him completely by surprise screwing around in menus with his pipboy up. Somehow he still managed to live long enough to close out, equip his weapon, and kill me with one shot. I haven't turned off pacifist since.
---
I ain't sure if that is not a typo. I believe that to be 25% crit DAMAGE, not chance.
---
Yeah i refuse to do the sheepsquatch event because of that. I‚Äôm only one man, i can‚Äôt take on an abomination, and a plethora of other things. üòî
---
You need to admit that you have a problem. Hint, its not your stash or scrip limit.
---
if you need large groups of random strangers to cooperate and complete a task, you should be talking to them verbally, and not expecting them to know or assume you know what and how to do stuff.
---
I disagree. 
---
FO76 is moving into it's next stage, content to extend the longevity of the game. This content shouldn't compensate for beginners, it should be for the veterans and tailored to give them a challenge. Look at the burrows, it may not have been for beginners but it certainly wasn't for veterans. 
---
I understand what you're saying. I gave up on trying to get a piece of the sloth during the Fasnacht event and was satisfied with just getting the plans. 
---
However with SSI I did it with all 4 of my characters, 3 of them under 50 and 1 of those under 20. But I got in there, I activated pylons and I tagged the imposter enough to get a bunch of frickin' fedoras. I died a lot but I gave up so not to even give people an opportunity to revive me. Same with free range. 
---
I haven't played paradise yet. People are comiserating on how difficult it is. Good, it needs to be. It needs to be something beginners look to participate in the future, not polish off solo before they get their Somerset Special. It may be a ghost town by then so you better make a friends while you're leveling up because it most likely will be just you guys.
---
I am survival oriented player. I find the vast majority of survival suggestions here terrible, most of them look at a single perspective and the requested changes would totally fuck shit up for other players.
---
This is different. This is good. This looks at broad consequences and gives all interested players what they want. Its the first "dont show me on map" post I upvoted. I support it fully.
---
Not everything sells immediately, and if you hang out on the same server all day selling fizzles, too, but junk does sell. I make more than my box can hold though, so some has to be vendored. Gotta have room in my vendor for all those 2* and 3* weapons and armor I've collected for sale.

Where did you see her at? I noticed some weird bug hive things at an encampment thing that wasn't there before, and they aren't Scorch Beast droppings. What are u doing @bethesda
---
While he is the final enemy, and it is necessary to kill him, the quest objective is to still protect the friendly animals. Sure, you can all abandon that and go to kill him, but that increases the chance of the event failing. The quest markers right now are correct, because the point is to NOT abandon them at this point. For me the event has failed twice because the animal in the Alphas habitat died quickly and no one was left to protect the animal that was still alive in the other habitat. So, while everyone was fighting him, the last animal died alone and abandoned and the event failed. 
---
We do not need a quest marker to him, because then the event will fail even more often.
---
Aaah i see. Even after lvl 324 you can learn new things , thanks a lot man. Not been using vats for many levels so far.
---
When I heard 7 story tower I was hoping for something a little more creative not just a block. I do enjoy the inside though.
---
Yesterday he gave me 100 pre-war money and made me overencumbered.
---
I've beaten him to death with my weapon and took those 8 fusion cells and 2 steel off him.
---
That was a way better reward.
---
You should check the player‚Äôs IGN and send him a friend request next time. I did this a few times and it worked 80% of the time (n = 5).
---
Sorry, didn't see your post yesterday.
---
They managed to fix the purveyor, only to bug everything else....
---
can you share the details of what happened, or provide a link that describes what happened and how?
---
i'm on PC fallout76, just scared it may happen to me.
---
True, after leveling my 1st to lvl 77...throwing away so much stuff, now playing my main who is lvl 324 i still throw so much ammo , junk &amp; aid cause nobody is buying shit . Only thing ppl are buying is maps for 20c each lol. Luckily i have 5 toons maxed on caps so its more about the point.
---
How cheap must you put prices on junk ? I sell all junk for 2c each .
---
Yeah, its people like you :D
---
Tell me how to live.....
---
she's in the mountains above wotoga, little tent and junk the we all carry.
---
swear I thought "fuck, I've dropped another player". fresh as daisy.
---
just stuck in my head
---
Are you serious?
---
What's your main weapons prefix? 2h melee isn't a build so kinda vauge to go off.
---
And in case they are listening  
---
we should get the vertical half walls added to all wall sets free  
---
bu yes, paint, wallpaper and paneling would be nice
---
I build my camp to be mobile. Then save blueprints. I live every where for 40 capsi
---
Completely disagree. This is due to all this easy "noobs can play" content. This is the false direction. Noobs have content, veterans don't. It's getting fucking boring. We need more content a noob couldn't possibly survive. They have nooby stuff to do, and seeing more end game content will make them want to achieve that. Again, F the noobs honestly.
---
I did only one event so maybe I am wrong but in the third wave we have as objective only "defend against boss". We didn't see a single enemy attacks our animal. If you say that other animals are still in danger during the third wave, I understand that you have to stay in position
---
Definitely, the people clearing out the mob enemies help the big hitters focus on the boss, so it‚Äôs just as important 100% should get to loot it I guess it‚Äôs maybe hard to programme in otherwise people could just hang around and do nothing and get rewarded?
---
Ofc its strong...you can be pretty much one shotted by a basic enemy if hit. It should do a lot of dmg
---
Personally I like to wait for someone to accidentally hit me, then I gank them and take all thier junk. Great way to get bonus flux at sbq.
---
Hear hear I second
---
I've got an ISS Fireaxe and and an AA SS Bat. I've been using PA but want faster paced but my armor is a mess.
---
If I could play go fish I'd be happy to run an underground go fish tournament
---
There‚Äôs a really weird one of those south literally right at the bottom middle of the map next to a lake there‚Äôs a tent and a woman I think she‚Äôs called civilian, very strange
---
Yeah! With one of my 3 chars the game STOLE my sheepsquatch loot (imposter one) from the event I triggered, lol!  
---
Because I activated two Pylons (nobody was doing it) and died after, the tags I did to the ISS before it's shield gone down didn't count! And between death and respawn, it lowered its shields, and (strangely enough) got killed before I could go back there and get my "tag" (the one with lowered shields, as I did attack it before that phase)
---
I have seen a few pictures of them. May be a tease for Wastelanders?
---
Now, the mothman is wanting to have some bread and pork cutlet or grilled chicken to go with it.
---
I have done the event about 8-ish times. 
---
IF, and this is a big if, everyone has cleared their habitats completely then sure, the friendly will do well. But we rushed back when we noticed out friendly bloatfly dropping health like crazy, being the last creature left. A assaultron had wandered into the habitat from the center part and killed him in seconds. Events failed. In theory you can abandon, but that theory does not work, because there can be trash mobs around every corner and most of the friendlies have lousy HP.
---
Better suggestion would be that everyone gets to loot the Boss, tagging or no. You should be rewarded for protecting your objective too.
---
I saw someone selling a couple of dozen Stimpack diffusers. I think you can get the plan for Stimpack diffusers as well.
---
Vanguard/cavalier would be nice
---
Just throw yourself off a ledge or something. I killed myself for a friend by repeatedly jumping off the roof of my CAMP.
---
Just turn pacifist off and make sure they are not on your team and have them kill you with a low dps/non-automatic weapon. Then when you are down, team up and have them stim you. (: Worked for me without having to depend on an enemy.
---
Yeah, I had a plan in mind. The item itself doesn't drop.
---
Never satisfied
---
Check to see if you have pacifist mode on
---
So Anti Armour works regardless of what your HP sits at- do you sit with rads or Nah? 
---
My enforcer is a 2h build- but he uses bloodied weapons. We keep him half Hp half Rads, with radicool you'll get extra strength point from the rads. This opens up UNYEILDING armour as his HP is pretty much halfed always. 
---
Combine that with him always swinging his axe- costing AP so we added AP REFRESH to keep him hitting.
---
He's also constantly moving to dodge attacks or to attack himself, so we Added CAVALIER into the mix. 
---
Proud to report that he can hit 1788 with a powerfist normal attack.
---
If you manage to keep the animals alive for a while, something called Formula Q heals them. However, after formula Q, the friendlies started attacking me. Dunno if this is intended or not.
---
Call me stupid but are you agreeing or disagreeing? If i'm comprehending correctly you're disagreeing with style lol
---
In the North there's a place called Aaronhold Homestead - in the fields there are vines growing cranberries, and you can bake thhese ibto cobblers for a 5ÔºÖ bonus to exp, and eventually you can learn to make cranberry relish which gives 10ÔºÖ
---
I experience something similar to this from time to time, but it only ever occurs in third person. Switching perspective seems to fix it. Been dealing with this issue as long as I can remember, but I couldn't really point to the cause.
---
lol right
---
I jumped off the pool house at Whitespring onto the steps of the pool. If in too deep doesn't work so you need the steps. And there's still some water on the steps so they'll be credited with reviving a player in water too
---
Damm that Chernobyl...i live in Finland ( check it on map how far away if you dont know ) and was 3yo so i ofc dont remember but when people speaking about  how it even spread here and contaminated forrests in southern Finland. Nasty af accident
---
I don't agree. Also I'm not entirely sure I understand the question.
---
In all honesty I shouldn't be banned from an event because I'm a higher level player than the event requires, if that were the case I wouldn't be able to do half of the new content that's dropped so far or even get myself a backpack for that matter, its players approach that should change at higher levels, I dont need the xp now, nobody over level 150 does, I have all the perks I want and levels banked for whatever I want, i now take part in the events just to concentrate on getting the mechanics done as that is a role that alot of players seem to avoid and majority of the time is the reason events fail... √∑veryone's too busy shooting the sheepsquatch whilst Betty is getting mauled by level 10 blood bugs would be the most prime example of this. I want the plans and rewards from the events as much as a level 50, 70 or 350 does, my level shouldnt exclude me from this. I do carry a courtesy weapon just in case I need to use it but the majority of the time it's not necessary as there enough low level players there hungry for that xp that mobs dont even get too me whilst I'm concentrating on collecting kindling for the campfire tales to keep that fire stoked.
---
this would be amazing, the amount of people who just focus on the boss and ignore the other objectives is just absurd.  
---
" hey the Brahmin are dying"
---
__team proceeds to just do tick damage to the boss__
---
Kiddie corner has 5 bears on a shelf in the larger building
---
Just the thought of bloodied gets my ocd going. Maybe Vanguard Cavalier?
---
1 hit or rads and you've got no major prefix. wouldn't really work properly on a melee. 
---
Vanguard/sentinel would be good for a sniper Maybe.
---
Vanguard would be decent if autostim perks worked at a higher hp percentage imo
---
Were you in combat with your attackers? You have to be in combat to have your base vulnerable.
---
The thing is, later Fallouts mention Appalachia as in inhospitable, Glowing Sea-like place, possibly as a result if the wanton nuking that the dwellers of 76 carry out in order to fight the SBQ. So it wouldn't make sense to do it outright, unless there is more to the story that we don't know.
---
Sweet yeah just ignore everything I just typed...
---
I can make both of em
---
No. 
---
Clan camp system definitely wouldn't work because servers aren't static and players come and go. 
---
I'm not sure what the other one means, really, but I do most quests solo.
---
Never shows up.
---
I recently came back to 76 after a few months away.. thinking "I know they increased the stash space a bit since I last played. 4 thousand to 8 thousand.. it's still not enough but at least they doubled it!" Then I remembered we were still in the hundreds, not the thousands. I turned the game off and haven't gone back since.
---
Did you build your base at a workshop?
---
I don't always shoot him, sometimes I stab him or bash him.  It all depends on my mood.
---
Well you went into armor for a bloodied build. I don't have a bloodied weapon, can't stand having more than 20% rads and even put "non bloodied" in the title.
---
Can I join?
---
When you select a location to fast travel sometimes nothing happens, or it goes out of the map and you are looking at the world again. Happens very often to me for the past 2 weeks or so, it‚Äôs pretty annoying. You‚Äôd know what he‚Äôs talking about if you have it happen
---
Yes they are EVERYWHERE... houses, gardens, farms
---
If anyone needs plans, walls or otherwise, let me know. Pc platform. Expensive plans I let go for 100 caps or less usually. Recipes which are normally 50 caps, I let go for 5 caps. Certainly willing to bargain too. I love helping neighbors! If you're nice sometimes I even toss in stuff for free like disease cures or stimpaks. LOL. Name on pc is same as up here.
---
Exactly ! Upvote and hope Bethesda will see this post.
---
Check your various perk cards too.
---
I hadn't looked too far into them so I didn't know that, thanks for info~
---
Yea I live in southern md.. and have lived in WV as well..
---
holy shit this looks amazing.
---
I overheard one of the scout robots talking about wildlife native to Appalachia. Where the heck are all the snakes? I'd settle for a critter...
---
I think with how wishy-washy Bethesda has been with Lore in terms of Fallout 76, I don't see it being a small retcon for the sake of giving a game life. I just want there to be a reason to keep playing. You can only nuke the SBQ and max out new characters so many times before you eventually get bored and leave the game forever.
---
Yea I lived in southern MD and in WV
---
Sounds like third person problems. Theres a plethora of 3rd person problems. Only 1st person problem ive repeatedly had is when i ADS it centers just below where youre actually shooting. Give or take an inch depending on screen size.
---
I prefer 5000
---
Follow this dude...i used pretty much same. Cant go wrong really üëç
---
i must be lucky..havent encountered that yet
---
I picked up a 'Toad Eye' from a radtoad the other evening. Went looking for it in my inventory later but it didn't have a visual model assigned to it. Some odd stuff going on.
---
Dude you're up close getting smacked constantly and you want to use armour that only buffs you when you're at max health? 
---
The reason I'm suggesting Unyeilding is because you'll gain WAY MORE damage you combo Unyeilding and Radicool. 
---
If you don't like rads and aren't going to use bloodied, let's be real for a minute, 2h melee is going to be ineffiecent as fuck. You could try sit at full health and have vanguard's popping off but 1 radium rifle bullet or one gamma round and you won't get that buff anymore. 
---
Honestly UNYEILDING or BOLSTERING are the best because you don't get the effect until you need it, at lower health.
---
wasnt aware of this, thanks for the tip
---
You havnt modded since morrowind... my man..
---
How would discussion mode work? What I mean is how do you think would be the best implementation?
---
Mothman didn't know that I'm herbivore -))
---
I don't think the servers would be big enough for clan support with the currwnt player cap. Now team bases I could get behind.
---
Dude, cry about it. It's a glass cannon. They already nerfed it in PVP significantly (bloodied cant 1 shot but you can 1 shot bloodied). As for PVE, blame Bethesda for not making content hard enough to appreciate having a full health bar.
---
Like in Fallout 4, you know ;)
---
Mmmm you wont loose Vanguard prefix for some hits or rads. Also, with cavalier you can sprint close to the enemy to give gim some love with your 2h. For snipers... unyielding sentinel + bloodied weapons works like a charm
---
My friend hasn‚Äôt had it happen to him either, I get it constantly. Can‚Äôt fast travel myself or to teammates
---
U think I am crying? Lol mate 
---
I believe ure Bloodied player
---
Wonder how u gonna play if they nerf that lol
---
Lots of glowing ones and fora

Ya I‚Äôve seen them a few times. It‚Äôs just one of the random encounters there‚Äôs some with notes on them as well. Hopefully a tease for wastelanders
---
Came across a deathclaw that was a travelling merchant apparently.
---
WE DON'T DOORS
---
Why wouldn't you? Vanguard only works at full health? So if you're not at full health you'd not get it? 
---
Cavaliers only works while you're sprinting, if you're running at someone you can't hit them, and if you can hit them you're not running anymore.
---
Had a great example of this at Artkos yesterday. Saw there were quite a lot of players there so thought it'd be an easy run. Nope. Everyone went after the alpha while I tried to chase a suicidal wolf magnet yogi. Failed.
---
They are working on this
---
They could give us  special mode like Survival with max - example 4 clans on the map.  
---
The company like bethesda  can do anything if they wants.
---
There's an unmarked shack near prickets fort with about 10 bears. I like not many people knowing about it so that's all I'm gonna say ;)
---
I am asking 3k and it's lvl 50
---
Just for clarity what perks are counted as ‚Äúgod roll‚Äù ?
---
I concur with this so much. I have gotten so much crapp but then last night on 2 straight purchases I got a 3 star unyielding heavy combat chest piece with plus 1 strength and weapon weight reduction  And and unyielding heavy robot left arm with weapon weight reduction in plus 1 charisma. Hang in there people there is some good in this damn shop!
---
I used to a herbivore just like you, then I got tired of picking up wood and making corn soup.
---
lol they do fix some things but they also don't fix some things so I think I will just take it however I get it and not stress. for me its a very minor annoyance I automatically avoid/work around without thinking about it.
---
Oh yeah I must reevaluate myself because I enjoy killing people in fallout and it makes them upset. It's really not that deep but hey, whatever you need to reach for lmfao
---
I think I'm tracking. Trade my AA SS Bat for a Bloodied SS 2h, grab some Unyielding or (and?) Bolstering armor, sit 50% health 50% rads and smack shit in the face?
---
I am level 121 and have played about 250 hours i guess.  To be honest i think that I got all my "good" weapons via trading and buying, almost never found / recieved anything that was really good / cool.   Mostly play with all rise (that i bought, never did the quest) and a .50 caliber machine gun. (1\* two shot). i might have earned that one myself.  All my lever action guns were 1\* and nothing too cool about them. Got a two \* shotgun that was ok, my 3\* star combat shotgun via the legendary vendor is meh
---
Also Marcus from new Vegas
---
I always enjoyed walking around Watoga and just looking around there. Pretty neat place as long as you dont mind level 24-50 robots smacking you at all times.
---
What "wishy-washy" lore did you see in 76?
---
Armour is irrelevant to some builds. I'm still wearing a mismatch of armour levels for the weapon weight reduction prefixes. In terms of DR, I don't necessarily need the extra 10 an upgrade from level 40 to 50 would provide. I don't intend to take damage in the first place, can't actually afford to as a bloodied build.
---
Wouldend that just be a gamemode at that point?
---
Like 4v4 team deathmatch etc. Plus the 'clans' would only be clans of 8 people.
---
&gt;can do anything if they wants.
---
Lol not if there are server/game limitations
---
Oh, those old good times when I bought F076 and dreamed that it will be a good game. After few days playing and reaching level 50 truth reveals. Only content game has to offer after 50 level is garbage collector simulator. 
---
...and reading those terminals is like torturing yourself. Some people like to torture themselves and they are luckily minority of us.  There is no immersion in this game at all.
---
You cannot physically get both at the same time. And the wording is that you gain no benefits from eating the opposite food. Half of nothing is still nothing. However, half of a 50% drain is 25%. The negative effect value is something that can be halved, so it should be.
---
were you in a team your base should be invulnerable unless you or a teammate is engaged in pvp - the only way to engage in pvp is to own a workshop and be attacked in which case they could attack your work shop but shouldn't be able to attack your camp OR your friend has to engage one of them in pvp in which case they can all attack your camp.
---
Absolutely. I've done this event 8 times and failed it every time except for one and that was only barely because I was the only 1 protecting the lone friendly bloatfly alongside my friend. There were 15 other people on the event so there's no reason why we only got 1 animal saved.
---
You are TL;DR person and your opinions are by definiton irrelevant.
---
I used to be a carnivore just like you but then I got soy in my hotdogs
---
It at least makes it worth the space in your CAMP if it does more than just telling you to visit Biv and the scout leader everyday
---
I'd honestly keep the Bat for when you're on 50% health 50% rads 
---
Just get one bloodied weapon to switch to when you drop low hp; get a few high hits off then stim back to 50% 
---
-Unyeilding is if you want more damage output with lower health. 
---
-Bolstering is more if you're tanking on lower health. (I use this myself- I tank while bloodied gets dps) 
---
They both trigger at the same HP threshold though if you DID have a mix of both.
---
We're going to need a bigger boat.
---
If I remember correctly, they outlined that they planned to have some sort of endgame clan support later this year at the end of their roadmap.
---
Depends on what the item the effect is applied to.
---
Anti-armor, bloodied and explosive are all fairly popular and good on basically any weapon that can drop with 'em. 
---
Instigating is fairly well received for some weapons but not all. Furious also same.
---
90% reduced damage is a modifier that can be really well received (say, on something very very heavy) or just sort of be a harness but not very useless 3rd effect if the item is already light.
---
That's about what I know, personally.
---
An awesome insight!
---
My first was surprisingly good. I got an Assassin's Explosive Combat Shotgun. Not somerhing I'll ever use, but hey, I'm sure someone could use it.
---
Pretty sure mine was working today. Make sure you update SFE though I think it needs it to run.
---
I would also love different variations of the walls we already have. Like wooden walls with different board organizations, or brick walls with a different brick pattern. There could also be versions that have graffiti or dirt on them to break up the pattern.
---
Last night I got 2 nice guns from her she was very kind.

Btw nice drop BE is pretty sweet
---
Since I've never run a bloodied build could you list the mandatory perks?
---
strong Nam June Paik vibes
---
Yes, why not. You can be leader if you like. We don't really have that many rules. Or any rules.
---
You like skulls, right? I think that might be a rule.
---
I did update it. Other mods are working tho. Even perk loadout manager works and that one needs sfe too.
---
All I want is plain, old grey concrete brick walls.
---
**FOR BOTH SIDES OF THE WALL.**
---
there's a cute lil smiley
---
Ok I wrote something under your previous comments here but now I'm completely disinterested in any response. You are toxic, delusional, and blocked.
---
Non cosmetic items should not be in the atom shop. Period.
---
Honestly it's buyers choice I like 3‚òÜ but there are plenty of valid reasons to go with 2‚òÜ
---
And I can put my stuffed animals on my bed!!!!  And on my couch, and on my dining chair!!
---
Nah it's fine. They should see it - the more the better.
---
And yes indeed lol
---
Actually you used to fire right through enemies that were point blank range when using heavy weapons, I think this behaviour was added to fix it, the problem is it is too aggressive and triggers with geometry not just enemies.
---
Radicool is a good one- more rads you have the more strength points it gives you. 
---
I'd also suggest mysterious saviour since sitting down on low HP means you go down quite often. 
---
The rest would be your regular 2h perks which you've probably got most of.
---
One died yesterday in out team of 4. 4 of us for the defuser and one got the bear arm
---
You should read that thread all the way through. I‚Äôve had experiences directly with smaller groups and we killed her much more quickly. I could copy  dozens of posts that have said the same, but whatever, today‚Äôs SBQ took very little damage despite serious firepower.
---
There's murder and the word fuck
---
If you're on x box, I sell bundles of 5k for 3.5k caps lol. I'm crafting like 10-15k a day.
---
Yep but i think that it is possible. Example, they could create a separate mode called: Clan Wars.  
---
Everyone can create clan with 10 people group. If they created clan and have 10 people they can enjoy a mode  called Clan Wars.  Clans could build a huge bases and they can fight with another clans. Instead C.A.M.P. will be flag. Each base of clan will have a Flag. If enemy clan capture that flag they captured enemy base. I don't know, that part of concept art is in developers hands. Everything connected with clans in that game would be awesome.
---
No, not because you enjoy pvp. Because you enjoy poorly designed pvp where literally the only point is to be a dick. Where you get nothing out of it that matters, except that you get to make people upset. That is why you should reevaluate yourself.
---
How did I plan to be a raider? Not by exploiting poorly designed game systems purely to make other people upset. I wanted to, you know, actually do things that raiders would do. Like raid. Kill people in ways that mattered and were fun... not just to piss them off for absolutely no reason by abusing exploits. 
---
Like, ignore the fact that you get a boner for killing people unfairly, and just look at it objectively. It‚Äôs crap. Anybody that doesn‚Äôt have an ego to feed would get bored of this poor excuse for pvp before they even started. Go play a good pvp game if you want to actually do something that matters. Play Dark Souls, where you *actually* get to play the bad guy and kill players in ways that are fun and actually matter. Not just stealing junk in a game where getting junk is trivial, just to piss people off.
---
Vanguard works even if you're not at full health. And yes, while you're sprinting you can swing your weapon (it's after the attack when you stop sprinting)
---
No you can do that yet, kinda sucks because the only ammo you can really sell in a vending machine is shotgun ammo because it's worth 1 cap per bullet
---
Thats litteraly how the game is supposed to work...
---
Cost for each unit sold
---
I have the hot rodder paint job. I pretend that is the atom cats predecessor.
---
I think this is why there is an event reward in addition to the legendary at the end. You get the event reward if you participate, even do the most good, by fulfilling event objectives, but the legendary killers get the legendary loot. Anything else would be too hard to program and get right.
---
It's supporting itself
---
Username checks out I guess? Lmfao üòÇüòÇ
---
You're right. It is about moving to the next stage. Not moving to the next level and staying in the same zone and taking from everyone who is brand new. This isn't about moving to your next stage so, instead of pushing your abilities to the Sheepsquach Imposter event, you should go grind Campfire Stories and become the lowest common denominator. And honestly, Paradise is not difficult beyond the glitches - it is reserved for higher level players really. You can't go in there below 40 or 30 and expect to be useful, let alone survive, which is great. From my experience, though, it requires the majority of those participating on board to get it done and complete the event. I have actually been revived many times here, indicating high level team players flock toward this kind of event. The same with SSI and Free Range (mostly, for Free Range).
---
On the other hand, team players seem to flock toward Campfire Stories only about Levels 1 to 40 or so, and above that, I have seen more people coming through and one-hit-killing everything at the expense of everything else. While they could be participating in an actual challenge (SSI or Free Range), they decide to go screw over lower level players somewhere else - and in many cases high level players who participate that are also being courteous and not screwing low level players out of their equal rewards, by taking out enemies before even the other high level players get the chance to damage the enemies at least once.
---
This game is based on Zones. The Forest is intended for approximately Levels 1 to 10; the Ash Heap 25 to 35, and the Cranberry Bog 35 and above. This is why you don't see Level 60+ Charred Ghouls wandering around Vault 76, or Level 5 characters wandering around the Whitespring (mostly, I know levels are instanced here based on players in the area). It is therefore safe to say Events in the Ash Heap shouldn't give Level 45 players advantages over Level 35 players (beyond their own EARNED damage resistance or gained health values - defensive gains). Likewise, Events which occur in the Forest shouldn't give characters above Level 10 increasing offensive advantages over everyone else below them beyond experience (what they actually learn) or their weapon durability gained via perks etc.
---
This is Fallout 76 - the endgame isn't to get to Level 35 as quickly as possible to take level 35 experience, perks, and a level 35 Legendary back with you to participate in level 5 Events - it is to advance your character and build it up to participate in the highest level Events with your best experience and equipment and perks. This doesn't mean you shouldn't get to participate in low level Events - it only means if there are lower level characters present, you shouldn't be able to steamroll all the enemies and the Event in comparison with them, and at their expense.
---
We don't need more reasons to discourage participation in Events. There need to be reasons to encourage it. If you drop into an Event as a newer character in the Forest (not necessarily a new PLAYER) and see yourself surrounded by Level 60+ characters, you shouldn't go, "well, waste of caps," and be forced with the choice to either stick it out and get a small XP boost, or leave and lose your caps. You should arrive and know it is fairly balanced, since it is in the Lowest Level Zone in the whole Map, so you can apply yourself to your maximum ability to get your maximum reward and best experience.
---
As far as i am aware and from my experience its caps per item. So you set the price of each individual bullet. So 500 bullets at 1 cap creates 500 caps (before tax). Hope this helps!
---
If it is true I will could so enjoyed that game. I enjoy now in fallout 76, i love that game but that think would be so awesome.
---
Block them switch servers, and hey can't join the next server you join unless they have a friend in it.
---
NP also the only stupid question is the one you don't ask
---
Thanks, this was what I did and I guess its the only solution.
---
I came across a civilian yesterday too.  First time.
---
Oh, I have more than 1K shotgun bullets... will put them when I am online.
---
Well, that's fairly accurate. There should probably be a better ratio. For every Campfire Stories low level Event, you get 4 SSI or Paradise type high level requirement Event. There are already enough low level character events out there.
---
If this ratio was kept up - or maybe 2 level 60+ Events, 1 level 35+, 1 level 5+ - then I don't see why there would be any reason to allow high level players to steamroll low level Events. It is a pretty valid point that there just aren't enough new High Level Events coming out, though, for High Level players - there aren't massive influxes of new players at this point, it is mostly Veterans seeking more challenge.
---
EXACTLY RIGHT! WE DON'T DOORS! *chants "we don't doors" off into the distance*
---
don't understand
---
It does. Thank you! I was afraid to put my bulletshop online... :)
---
The worst part about it was the squirrel took off mid attack and I had to chase it down to finish it off. Glad I'm not the only one to feel a bit uneasy about that challenge. 
---
No problems with ranged attack though as Squirrel on a Stick is AGI +3!
---
The text of vanguard's literally says 'gain extra dr + ER at full health'
---
This. -=o=-
---
And thus we will have the current problem, with people ignoring the objectives and goes for the easy reward.
---
Or I can play the game I want to, cheap kills are fun but it's better when they come back can. And I get enough junk it's funny. So you just wanted to pretend to be a raider but didn't wanna upset people? Sheesh
---
In the launcher try
---
Game options &gt; Check for Updates
---
or
---
Game options &gt; Scan and Repair
---
or try deleting everything in Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 (make a copy first)
---
Yes, automatically team us up and share the loot.
---
Server hopping for the robot vendor I‚Äôve seen these a lot. Usually accompanied by a tent that has trapper  armor plans in it.
---
It's not so much they die easily but that thing hits like a truck.
---
This is the main reasons to never accept random invites. 
---
Some people just want to fast travel for free, but others are trying to set you up.
---
Eh I think that be horrible but whatever floats your boat.
---
Mmmm I used Vanguard cavalier unarmed melee build when the game came out, and before changing to a bloodied ranged build. I remember that combination worked like that. Maybe has changed since last patches like sent/cavalier do. In that case Vanguard could be a shit :/
---
4 spawn on the shelf in the room behind Scoutmaster Treadly at Dolly Sods
---
Ooooo so I did miss this change. Yeah the guys attached me then my base. But the base I attacked nobody was there. Ok thanks I didn't know they had implied that change.
---
I am mostly looking for consistency in the balance. I have many high level characters, so I could one-hit-kill every goddamn thing in the Forest, not to mention do Free Range by myself with 100% of the Brahmin surviving (which I just did a moment ago, nearly barely) but I choose not to because it isn't kind or sporting, and I think the balance should reflect that with some smart scaling in low level regions. Either there's regions or there aren't. There are either Level 60+ Charred Ghouls at Vault 76 for brand new characters and Level 80 Yao guais all over the Forest region, and Events which are easily steamrolled by people who can easily match those kind of enemies (you know level 60+), or there are Events which are accomplished at maximum effectiveness by players around level 5 - 15 and no inappropriate level 60+ Charred Ghouls or 80 Yao guais or other enemies.
---
Fairly sure that they removed the option to report  based on lack of player skill
---
Lmaooo üòÖüòÖ
---
Explosive damage doesn't get armor penetration.
---
In PvP 25% fire rate would be better. Extra bullets mean extra chances to stagger.
---
In PvE explosive would be better because most everything dies in 1-2 shots anyways and ammo is a grind.
---
Yeah, I get that, but what I was saying is that there is a bone if you choose not to throw one shot the legendary's way. 
---
I run with a team, so we always split so there isn't this problem. As long as one of us gets a hit on the legendary, everyone can loot it. It'd solve this problem if everyone would just temporarily team up at events.
---
I like skulls. Which platform?
---
Camps can easily defend themselves, if the owner put the slightest thought into defense.
---
and folder for papers
---
You can do or think whatever you want. 
---
But the truth is that Fallout 76 pvp is poorly designed and all but pointless to engage in, at least in adventure mode. And you‚Äôre exploiting it, primarily to piss people off. 
---
There‚Äôs a difference between beating someone and them being a sore loser, and intentionally trying to piss people off. You‚Äôre doing the latter. You probably get some good hauls occasionally, I‚Äôm sure. But you‚Äôre also probably aware that junk is basically worthless, and more importantly it‚Äôs much easier to acquire via PvE. Don‚Äôt kid yourself. 
---
Again, I totally wish being a raider was possible in this game. It‚Äôs just not. At best, you‚Äôre just abusing bad game mechanics. Zzz
---
Or be careful who you decide to pick a fight with and pay attention to your surroundings and the map.
---
Yeah. People like you are the ones who positively affect all the other players around them.
---
High levels shouldn't be banned from coming to a low level event, but the high levels who come and 1HK everything denying any reward to everyone else are inconsiderate. The easiest solution would likely be rewarding all Legendary rewards as a drop at the end of all events - high level and low level region - so no one who actually made a difference misses out by having one player take out the only Legendary enemy. This would also eliminate the whole Scorchbeast Queen disappearing to the shadow realm with her Legendaries for all eternity thing too.
---
I think people forget that we had to wait almost 6 months before we had a warehouse for fallout 4. I'm pretty sure they'll release walls with planned, large DLC events as ways of convincing lost players to rejoin or new player purchases. 
---
Say what you want about Bethesda but they know how to stretch out their growth and product life cycles.
---
I read you can dump extras in the overseers' stash. I haven't tried it yet
---
also not being able to remove something because it allows access to something else...except it's not attached to anything else
---
The suck part on 3* armor is you run the chance of getting wood. Log off if you can't turn the armor in right away and you now have a 1* armor. Plz fix Todd.
---
By explosive heavy weapons, I meant stuff like the missile launcher and fat man. Not the explosive legendary effect. That's actually really good, and probably the best effect in that slot.
---
&gt; "You like PvPing in fallout? Then play darksouls" because that makes sense, love the souls series but that's just silly
---
That‚Äôs not at all what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm giving you an example of a game where you actually get to play the bad guy. In contrast to Fallout 76, where all you can really do is be an asshole irl.
---
I see the event on the map.
---
I don't show up because as soon as the boss pops out everyone forgets about the objective and attacks the boss while the friendlies die. I just go to the Whitespring while everyone is busy at the event and find a 3* ghoul and shoot it in the head.
---
PS4! ... but when I say 'we' realistically I mean 'me' xD
---
Same PSN as reddit handle. If you're ever in the area, call past for a vodka!
---
I only learned about challenges because I wanted to get the backpack for the additional carry weight. I really had to check Google on how to see the challenges at all. Never was aware of them. The fact that I  again needed to look up how to get this damn camera and then learning I had to perform the all beloved server hopping to maybe get one made me hate this whole challenge thing. For me they are just a plain pain in the ass and I won't bother even trying to get them. I only have limited time to play and I don't want to waste my time looking up how to get these challenges, then fast travelling somewhere and shoot some pictures. I am still struggling to get one or two legendaries a day to sell for scrip, so all my time is "wasted" for this.
---
In my opnion you should never need to server hop for any challenges at all. For me this a broken system/process. Nevertheless I will most certainly not doing these photo challenges. Challenges should be sort of fun, and for me it is clearly not fun at all.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
It involves going behind a tree to relieve yourself
---
Yeah, randomly invading someone's world is much better for the RP aspect. Lmao
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm after, too. Everyone‚Äôs player house looks way too clean at the moment. Every foundation should come with a scratched/torn up alternative, and some half-destroyed walls would be great. We need barn pieces with different colour boards. How about ruined pieces of furniture as well? If they won‚Äôt give us the means to build anything other than a cube, then let us make it a cube that fits the surroundings.
---
Vanguard says Grants up to 35 Damage and Energy Resistance, the higher your health so yeah its scale thing
---
For the love of atom; u/Ladydevann, u/Valseek please do some *magic* on this!
---
I will and I'll bring some Nukashine!
---
Any tips?  I was thinking high LCK or CHR might help RNGesus....
---
&gt; *'Most of the time, others seem to inflict some damage and let others get their damage in'*
---
So there's no problem then, just keep doing the events and ignore the ones where...
---
&gt; *But the rest of the time when a (level 307) decides they should just use their one-hit-killing explosive two-shot Legendary Combat Rifle...*
---
Don't expect Policing of the game to fit with your sensitivities, it will never happen, you will just end up getting bitter. I hate the *one-hit-killing explosive two-shot Legendary Combat Rifle* but if I encounter one of those being used by a douche I leave the are or jump server.
---
I've just checked and I'm sooo wrong.  Did that change?
---
Yeah because I kill so many pve mobs that have 100-300 plastic, acid  or any other junk. Oh yeah just as easy, if that's the only way you've played.
---
Also explain what I'm exploiting? Being on team? Bethesda specifically made it so that your whole team is involved once you are. Not an exploit you just sound mad
---
Can't say I agree with them selling three+ year old assets that we have already paid for previously. Any assets that are made specifically for this game are fine, since the budget has gone towards creating them. But assets from 4 and its EPs should be added with content updates free of charge IMO.
---
Yeah, the people fighting the little mobs are the real MVP, they actually care about the events.
---
Yea I fully agree, I just did the Sons of Dane Nightstalker mostly solo, some dipshit came in at the last minute and 1 shot the wendigo so I lost out on a potential 3 star, really pisses me off. Some people are aware of this and use Tesla guns to tag but not 1 shot, those people are nice.
---
A Chem that gives a boost to your Charisma and Luck.
---
Not as far as i'm aware
---
I don't see any point in converting anything above 2* into scrip. 3* items reward a good deal of scrip, certainly. But the machine loses a good deal of scrip payout for that one item converted, while at the same time there is hardly any weight deducted from your STASH maximum capacity.
---
On the other hand, if you remove many 1* items and convert them into scrip, you gain less scrip, but additional free STASH space per item converted. Which means you've got more STASH space to ~~STRIKETHROUGH~~horde store additional Legendary items (hopefully 1*) to convert into scrip the next day - if the limit was like 500 scrip per day, it would totally make sense for me to change 3* items to scrip, but it is far too small to even make sense to convert 3* items unless that's all I have - and we all know that 1* items is pretty much all we ever get.
---
If you have 2 or more of the same type of weapon equipped in your hot wheel the game only recognizes one when you log in again. That was fixed previously but broken again this patch.
---
Interesting... me and my buddy were able to do the event with just us 2 alone. We joined and had no idea what we were doing and only got a rank 2 glowing yao guai. The other two friendly creatures died right away since we didnt touch their troughs. Our main boss was a level 100 3* sheepquatch. He killed my buddy once but we eventually brought him down and completed the event.
---
Same with me Xbox.  Just started happening.  The first time i try to fast travel it acts like Its working then doesn‚Äôt.  Usually works the second time.
---
Been more of a bane of late for me on the Campfire Quest. Someone will just shotty the legendary and kill it before anyone gets a chance ü§¨ I could usually forgive if it's whitesprings and you have all of the ghouls piled atop and it becomes a free for all. But these latest quests are making the feeling of getting shafted so much more apparent...
---
I'll do it for free on pc, just give me some materials
---
Just buy the plans build and scrap. The mods are learned pretty quickly.
---
The 100 pre war money prize is really nice. Free cloth!
---
I shoot it afterwards tho
---
Oh ok it‚Äôs just I run a gas so it‚Äôs kind of like pimping up a car
---
&gt;I will do daily limit of legendaries in 2hours, if i won't grind them. If i do, it  will take me only 30minutes to get those 150scrips. So i am limited because fallout76 comunity is mostly non-gamers, good job comunity.
---
How do you do this exactly? I am happy to find two to three one star legendaries per session
---
They're been added in the New arktos event as a reward
---
Guy spends time during event watching others to see if they are contributing enough during events and spends 10 seconds going through the cannibal animation to eat the people who don't contribute.
---
Complains about people not contributing during events.
---
I sell all kinds of ammo in my machine at 1 cap per and it moves and I wouldn't sell shells there for less than 2 because they sell so fast.
---
Yeah, it is. At least, if you understand the lore of the game. Regardless, we‚Äôre talking about game mechanics, not RP. 
---
In Dark Souls, you take in the role of a mini boss when you invade. Your job is to stop the host. There‚Äôs an actual fun game to play there. The rewards (Souls/faction items) are basically worthless, but otherwise is is designed quite well. It‚Äôs potentially fun for everyone, which means both hosts and invaders are actively seeking pvp. The pvp community is alive and well, even today.
---
In Fallout 76, you exploit this weeks poorly designed game mechanic to kill people who don‚Äôt know any better, for basically no reason. There is no fun game to play... just exploiting. It‚Äôs potentially fun for someone who needs to win to feel good, at any cost. The pvp community (in adventure mode) is all but nonexistent on release, and always will be as long as it remains poorly designed.
---
You see the difference, right? Like, fun is subjective, I get that. Again, do whatever you want man. But objectively, Fallout 76 pvp is crap. And trying to weasel your way into killing people who don‚Äôt want to engage in the crap pvp is just... lame imo.
---
I‚Äôve got my camp near a junk extractor so I literally produce free stuff then sell it
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
Really? I tried to sell my ammo and no one's wants it for that much. Hmm, mabey I should charge more :o
---
awesome!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not sure that I have enough junk cuz I didn‚Äôt even have plan
---
Seems to be explosive (second star) / faster swing rate with bloodied, two shot, executioner, furious (for high fire rate, could replace explosive with faster fire rate for this one), or instigator (high damage)...  
---
Kind of depends on your build..   I hate bloodied, love two shot, furious, and like executioner/instigator.  I want to like vampire, but the boost never seems worth it.
---
Generally the target specific ones (e.g. troubleshooter, zealot, exterminator) are limited so not god rolls.
---
And I'm probably wrong about a lot of these, so let the comments roll!
---
(Ps - is it just me, or is explosive splash damage when shooting at close enemies increased?  I've been switching to melee more and more.)
---
Fuck yeah it is. I changed my build when i got a junkies explosive .50 now Im the most bad ass junkie palladin you ever did see
---
I'd like this for events and nuke zones if you're joining a team 3 players deep your Project Pardise just got easier. And sharing rad sponge is way more effective.
---
What mods do you want?
---
I see your point! The game certainly has flaws and doesn‚Äôt compare to previous fallout games still. But for ¬£10 I‚Äôm having a lot of fun with it
---
I see you making claims you can't back LMAO, which exploit have I used?
---
We don't want walls.  We want wallpaper.
---
Gotcha, If your on PS4 I'll help. I'm not sure I know all the mods yet but I can check when I get out of work
---
They drop only if all 3 creatures are alive at the end.
---
I find 5.56 and shells sell the quickest, but I also sell .45 and .50 cal.
---
For how much do you sell 5.56?
---
This üëçüëçüëç
---
What if.........Dual wield MG42's..........
---
You can sleep through that noise?
---
Pretty sure key ring should be its own menu under Misc that can be sorted not only alphabetically,but by most recently acquired. Same with holotapes.
---
This does work, but it also leaves ugly seams and can glitch a bit on the outside. A handy workaround, though.
---
So what you're saying:
---
Spawn Level 60+ Charred Ghouls at Vault 76, and Level 80+ Yao guais around the Forest region, eliminating the point of regions.
---
The thing is, I am already high level and have an array of 1HK perks &amp; weapons. I couldn't care less with regards to myself, I am just fair to others and don't 1HK everything in a region designed for low level players. Are you one of those players who can't survive in survival so you try to bait people in adventure and still lose?
---
Anyway, outside of events it doesn't matter much what damage you do or perks you use per region - but participating in a level 10 event in a level 10 region, the enemies either need to scale to the highest level player there, or the highest level player needs their damage reduced to that of the highest level player (within the region designed level) for fairness.
---
1 per, but I can hardly keep it in stock, so I am considering raising it.
---
So are you the one that baits or the one crouching and waiting for me to drop your teammate then you kill me.
---
Thanks for clearing that up- either way I've overlooked it in the past. 
---
If staying at full HP is your goal, it would scale down the more damage you take/lower you keep your health (capping at 50%)? How does that work with rads? Does the effect work off the full bar and rads is cutting into that?
---
Which are armored?  I have a AA shotgun, and ran it against mutants and robots but was surprised how little it helped
---
Omg... I sell mine for 1 cap per 2 bullets, god dammit
---
I tagged the boss and still didn‚Äôt get loot at Arktos event. Twice üòî
---
I literally put one in the recycler yesterday..,
---
I'd agree with you, but they've already started doing as much with Fallout 4 clothes in the atom shop so the precedent has already been set
---
Not sure if we're talking about the same thing, but i've met dead bodies called "Settler"  many times now since the BETA.
---
Separate button for opening main menu and map on keyboard? Like you know, in every game that ever existed. Please. It's so strange to open the map with escape button.
---
At least for myself the biggest thing about the 20 he refresh is carrying around weapons and aid. I'm currently utilizing the "if it reduces weight, equip it" for perks except for shotgun. Hit strength cap so since I have the fewest legendaries for shotties, it's reduced armor weight. All of my armor slots reduce weight on something. 
---
If I do a big event like scorched queen I'm gonna crap out on space! But I feel this does happen to players in my situation where you run into space issues and have to skip out on events just because of weight. Most of the things making weight for me are materials for making serums and ultracite ammo (it's getting lead that hurts), armor for different builds and aids items like bobbleheads.
---
It's hard for me to stop a few items so I have a few two-shot weapons I'd like to keep like a Fatman and a Gauss. Sadly even a gauss eats up like 14+ space!
---
Platform and mods you want?
---
Yes, I‚Äôve been at several SBQ events and my focus has been the adds. I do try and give a few shots or smacks to the Queen, but when I get to looting she just spins.  It‚Äôs disappointing for sure.
---
I don't even do that for teammates anymore. It. 75 per for them unless they've recently done me a solid
---
I got a Vampire Ultracite Gatling Laser with two decent second stars like those (forget exactly) but I don't run a heavy weapons build.  May actually try to sell my first gun, lol.  Seems like a waste to recycle it.
---
Black Titanium, Screws, Aluminum, Balistic Fiber all sell well common junk not so much
---
Wait, so those prize certificates are useless?? I have two and was saving them. I thought I would eventually come across a place I could trade them in for something nice...
---
And this is why I always carry a vampiric switchblade with me.
---
Weighs nothing, does risible damage but enough to 'tag', is fast, keeps me ticking; I have lost count how many AWOL armaments, Violent Nights etc has come incredibly handy in.
---
Arguably I have been lucky with other players, most of them get off the one-shot carriage when they see that you also could but are taking steps not to.
---
You can get away with higher prices in-game than on Reddit. Here, everything is cheaper
---
Probably the most ingenious and unintentional "trap house" settlement! Potential death on instant fast travel arrival!
---
Honestly, I'm thinking how awesome it would be to run around the Forest with my Ghoulbreaker (I named it that because it was an epic god roll from Murmurgh) slaying Level 60 Charred Ghouls - it was also pretty terrifying trying to get to the Whitespring on my new character a few days ago with these things there, nothing but crouching and sprinting so I imagine it would be a true apocalypse if this happened for new characters üòÜ
---
DMG reduction while aiming rocks for some.  I aim a ton.
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt kno how to collect the frog , but u did it, thank u
---
MODUS only plays global thermonuclear war.  He doesn't have the same taste as WOPR.
---
Technically it was advertised since one of the live action trailers showed a friendly Deathclaw in a player owned Camp while the players were around a bonfire.
---
And carry more backup weapons, ammo, etc...
---
Sure thing, my camp is near Site Alpha.
---
I'm level 46 and I haven't even been to Harper's Ferry yet! Can't play today due to work, but for reference, if you don't mind, what's getting you down? Mobbed by ghouls while in melee mode? The Assaultron at the end? Thought about trying it one of these days but maybe I better hold off.
---
They do have some rather nice unreleased floors for the atom shop, including several really nice tile floors, but there are more of like patio tiles. Given that I have a porch, it would be nice to get something other than my dark wood which is also used for inside for it. Btw, who else is excited for the new potted plants and potted cacti? When I saw that in the leak I was so happy. Plants just play such a huge role in my camp design as it explains how my guy keeps his sanity, he tries to live a "normal" life and keeps the plants as a way to make him feel like he is doing some good for the world.
---
I think this might be a start of a beautiful friendship lol. I'm always needing 556 and need a steady ammo dealer. We might need to exchange info.
---
I do events i see on map. Uranium fever = 3x legendary, leader of pack = 3legendary, AWOL = 1legendary, Horde events = 1legendary, legendary mobs are everywhere, Whitespring golf club 1-10legendaries, west-tek 1-5legendaries, free states = 1legendary,....     
---
How exactly you **don't** find legendaries, thats real question :D
---
Damn, I would love to have backpack... how to get it? I know it somehow connected to boyscout quests, but they are realy annoying to do. Is there a faster way?
---
Hmm, Off the top do my head there‚Äôs Brotherhood combat armor and helmet, 6 PA paints from Initiate to Elder. Also there‚Äôs a Botherhood recon rifle that‚Äôs craftable. All these items are found in the game and rare sans the combat armor which is buyable at vendors.
---
I‚Äôm going though it right now, got into power armor and switched loadout and I‚Äôm doing fine now :) thanks anyways!
---
I‚Äôm PS4 
---
And I need 
---
Aligned long barrel
---
Aligned grip
---
Stinging magazine 
---
And best non automatic receiver I dunno what is best for max damage not crits
---
This...when a month dies on an intersecting plane it's death will make it weirdly clip into the plane. It's turning into a meat pile will typically force it back to the right plane. If you sometimes fast travel to a zone and see it loading everything in front of you, that's basically the various planes where.a monster can die and glitch into. I had to do wait for mins to be a meat pile especial during the faschnafcht festival.
---
Yep... each chance is independent of the next.  Otherwise you could win every coin toss by flipping it that morning, then waiting to flip it that night when the group makes a big decision...  unless one of them sneaks into your room and flips it again, ohhh plot twist!
---
I buy legendaries, junk and ammo mostly.
---
I think with the legendary vendor now, not many people are trading legendaries and instead they are scripping them.
---
What are the legendary effects on "Ghoulbreaker" I'm curious what type of weapon is it?
---
How did you get the bug grenade plan? I dont think I have it
---
I had no idea what we were supposed to do. Ended up alone in a room with "Nasha, the friendly glowing bug". She died after a few waves of WTF IS GOING ON
---
OH THANK GOD FINALLY!!!!!!
---
No, but you can farm mobs to easily get any of that in about 10 minutes, if you know what you‚Äôre doing. Rather than hoping you get lucky enough to trick someone into engaging you who also happens to have a ton of junk. Maybe you‚Äôre lucky, I don‚Äôt know. But PvE is much faster in general.
---
I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre pvping in a group. I don‚Äôt have any problem with unfair pvp, although the Fallout legendary system really takes it to another level... but whatever. When I say ‚Äúexploiting poorly designed mechanics‚Äù, I mean doing everything you can to trick people into pvping with you, like sending them team invites. Or having a friend take a workshop while you camp someone halfway across the map, before it was patched. In other words, taking advantage of poorly designed pvp to force pvp on people who would rather just not engage... not because they‚Äôre scared, but because it‚Äôs not fun.
---
And let me clarify, I don‚Äôt have any problem with the fact that you do this. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmad‚Äù lol. If you didn‚Äôt, somebody else would. And again, I‚Äôm sure you get some decent hauls occasionally, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs literally pointless. But... that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Fallout 76 pvp is crap, and the main reason that it might be enjoyable is that you get to piss people off. Which is lame.
---
I‚Äôm always hopeful to find an instigating harpoon gun. Seems like a good opener for a group
---
Yeah and places where an item should fit, and is green meets you with the same message.
---
PC. Can't help you, sorry.
---
It‚Äôs ok thx for response
---
Silently judging you about the killed Brahmin.
---
No. I‚Äôm the one who pays attention to my surroundings and thinks ‚Äúohh look, a low level trying to start something. That‚Äôs probably a trap, and even if not it gives me no benefit‚Äù. If you‚Äôre too stupid to think of the possibilities, then that‚Äôs your own fault.
---
Yep...  you can't put things in your stash at a workbench, but you can take them out.  Took me a bit to realize that too, but hey... game physics gonna game.
---
They don't need to nerf bloodied. I've been killed by getting caught downwind of a Super Mutant fart. It's an even trade off.
---
Relax man, I‚Äôm not accusing you of cheating. Try to understand my actual point. 
---
More show up every day, and even more leave. If pvp is only fun for one side, then it‚Äôs not sustainable. You just pvp a lot, so you don‚Äôt see it.
---
A guy on the Bethesda forums claims he came across one. Here is his post message.
---
"Two days ago I found one sitting on the table inside of the trailer in the small brotherhood camp (the walled camp with the tank in a rut in the cranberry bog) near fissure prime."
---
I think he may have been mistaken and meant the tactical helmet instead of the combat helmet. Going to scope it out multiple times and report back. If it somehow does miraculously spawn there I will make a post showing proof of it naturally in the world, the learned crafting plan, and my backpack with several to be distributed. I hope he is right, but I got a feeling he was mixed up.
---
I'm 850 hours into this and LV200 have not needed a stimpak diffuser yet why would I need it now. BTW WTH is a stimpak diffuser anyways? do not remember this in FO 1, 2, 3, NV, or 4

So, TYL what TIL means. 
---
Neat.
---
Lol read bread at first
---
God i must be low on AP...time for a canned coffee.
---
Makes sense!

Nice!
---
What about those who run junk shield?  I usually stash my cool stuff, so they just get a mouth full of fertilizer, cloth, and glass.
---
This, I would pay the big bucks for new building sets
---
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt dispute what the computers are programmed to do so I‚Äôm going to claim you‚Äôre wrong because I feel like it‚Äôs different.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve noticed on some servers it will allow me to build in a friends camp. In others I can‚Äôt open the build menu
---
Great, and encouraging, news! I hate having to wear power armor but it just can't be avoided sometimes. I've heard explosive weapons can end up killing you a lot down there, so I guess I'll have to try it with my non-legendary pew-pew.
---
I just came a little
---
The PvP honestly isn't as bad when you start pitting PvP builds and people who understand it against each other, that's what I prefer the most. I honestly get what you're saying with pve, but it's just simply not true. Is everyday as profitable as the last? No, but I've literally gotten 480 acid off 1 kill. Don't know if you've ever farmed acid(I have for smelting) it's no where near that quick. That took 2 mins of being on a server to obtain. Pissing people off only became an enjoyment when I realized, both the willing and non willing would end up just as pissed. I'm not harassing people over mic until they rage or something. They shoot me or a friend back, I kill them simple as that.
---
Regular rain worked for me. Took a picture of the robot at pumpkin house.
---
Got it doing stings n things... I believe... it would be on tankers bench under gernades
---
I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed this. I play with my fianc√©e an awful lot. We bump into legendaries fairly often. The lower level ones, if we one shot them, the other person always gets no loot.
---
U have to complete the first quest line with scouts and U‚Äôll receive the backpack
---
Stings n things... I believe.. it's on the tinker's bench under gernades
---
&gt; They actually upped the damage on all of the 50cal receivers in the same patch. Standard was higher than Refined before the patch, but because you could rarely find the plans, few people noticed.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I wouldn't shout about it if I were you, because the likely "fix" would nerf the standard 50cal receiver.
---
So, are we supposed to be fear of them? Is this like a dictatorship?
---
I'm pretty sure it heals nearby teammates too. It's like of the conditions for a tadpole badge(medic I think).
---
Yep ! Simply submit a ticket to Bethesda. They'll refund you with atoms.
---
Yeah...  for those of us running junk shield its like "thanks for taking my armor that's just trash for you"
---
Sure, steal my ballistic fiber, you're a jerk (and I'm an idiot for bringing it in) but my cloth?  Wth man.
---
Keep in mind if you complain that people don't join your event AND you steal people's stuff - some of us are delayed (or don't bother) because we have to drop our stuff off first because of peopke like YOU.
---
Personally I would do away with the 'Legendary Boss' mechanic and keep the 'Mission Rewards'.
---
If anything add a chance of legendary reward for 'outstanding performance'.

Give that a try? It isn't my spreadsheet, you could try from the original subreddit thread here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/
---
You have to be close enough. We farm all the time, and I can assure you that you don't have to get a hit in if you are on a team.
---
Yes I understand PvP used to be way more broken than it is now, and used to avoid it. But once I started focusing on getting a good PvP build in line, and following certain metas it became way more fun and made me start pvping again.
---
Yeah...  it's actually a game...
---
ok I just have to get lucky he keeps giving me the mounted plans
---
Got you.... I agree with the OP then,  there should be a server wide announcement that the dungeons have started. 
---
Maybe they should have a notification timer of all events (with the option to not display if you are not interested) 
---
Maybe under your tracked quests at top right
---
It's their fault if they put up crap and yours for going there.  
---
Since more than not, people don't want to have to worry about caps 99% of people want whatever is the max.  
---
Screw the economy good enough and it will take forever to recover.
---
They made plans available at vendors for BoS armor, the patch before last. Cheap; like 200 per chest and limb plan. You have to find or buy actual combat armor, but once you do, it can be modded to BoS for a good upgrade in terms of DR.
---
20% health, nerd rage, Adrenal Reaction, all rifleman perks, bloody mess max.
---
call it Davey, for Davey Crockett
---
You won't need strong back with unyileding armor
---
Just PC Things.
---
They have something like that in Borderlands pre sequel, it‚Äôs like a bank you can store your stuff in that can be accessed by any saved character you have
---
It's if I wasn't heading to work in couple minutes I would help you out. I can craft every single hand made mod.

I am on ps4, same gamer tag that you see here.

 If you can't find anybody to do it I will do it when I get home from work if you're still on.

Ya sure thx, I‚Äôll msg u if I won‚Äôt find anyone 
---
Appreciate
---
That's the hardened receiver I believe, I'm pretty sure I have all those unlocked.
---
It is pure RNGesus nothing more than that
---
Not having a better respec system stiffles creativity and keeps me from trying out new builds, just small variations on what I always run.  The time per point just isn't worth it to try new things out.
---
To bad I can‚Äôt upvote this more than once!
---
You know with anyone asking these questions, you can go on this subreddit and search up ‚Äúformula p recipe‚Äù and the first thing that pops up is a post someone made telling you exactly what it is. Just a heads up.
---
The receiver you want is Hardened.

same here

I notoced My bar pieces don't go so close together anymore without some rubber encouragement. Luckily the mat doesn't look out of place.

You have to pay 2k caps

Building under stairs of any kind is indeed a pain atm...

No, this would result in dupers having a field day with ease.
---
Wow, you got some some sweet ones there, yourself.
---
Yesterday at my vendor I sold 4 legendary weapons, several serums, a bobble head, a couple of outfits, some ultracite, gold, and some ammo.
---
What's your system I go to Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore. Server hop at mountainside bed and breakfast for Acid to collect 200-400 acid then server hop some more to farm steel. How long does it take you to craft all that ammo.
---
We need clean crappers, tubs, sinks, and showers.  Or at least non dilapidated tubs and crappers.  Why would I build a nice house only to put a busted toilet in it?
---
Thanks, I'm still jelly you got a BE
---
I thought the ammo factory did have a cap...Was this changed recently?
---
My friends and I were just talking about this yesterday. If they put different walls in the atom shop we‚Äôd  buy them like crazy.
---
I buy junk(mainly plastic and aluminum when it's reasonably priced), ammo when I'm low, cheap legendaries (100-500 caps), and plans I don't already have.
---
Been looking for ultracite pa mods/plans but haven't had much luck.
---
Boss loot should be part of the events. Do this with SBQ as well. When sheepsquatch, or the SBQ is dead, who ever participated in the events get loot as a reward, rather than looting,the boss
---
I don't have to worry about that since I do not accept team invites.
---
It may have been the clean up one... not sure when I got it
---
Kay.
---
Ok, you got 480 acid one time, for probably a minute or two of effort. How often do you get even half that? A quarter? How often do you get nothing.
---
I kill Yao Guai and get like 5 acid every time. Have you seen how many Yao Guai spawn in the new event? I have an infinite supply of acid that I get while farming legendaries, XP, and tons of other materials as well. Why would I ever waste my time killing players to get acid? Or any material. It‚Äôs nowehere near optimal.
---
If all you do is shoot people with a mate hiding in a bush, then that‚Äôs fine. Still pretty lame pvp design, and not at all sustainable, but that‚Äôs not your fault. But either way, if you enjoy pissing people off, that‚Äôs not a good thing lol. And definitely something you need to reevaluate. Shitting on people for fun isn‚Äôt healthy, even if it is just a game. We‚Äôre supposed to play games together for fun, yeah? Laughing at sore losers is one thing, but reveling in the fact that you‚Äôre ‚Äúa wasteland menace‚Äù is a bit much.
---
I want the option to paint the walls.
---
40% Faster Swing Speed
---
30% Damage Boost vs Ghouls
---
+1 Endurance
---
With all the two-handed melee perks maxed, it one-hit-kills every maxed Ghoul (regardless of type) at the Whitespring (without power attacking) - power attacking one-hit-kills every maxed Wendigo which spawns at the Whitepspring from my experience, and I have found it goes hit-for-hit against the Yao guai that spawn around the place. It is a pretty even match against a Level 65 Legendary Sheepsquatch solo, I have found (Free Range obviously). The additional DPS (and stagger per second which slow enemies) due to the swing speed is the best thing about it, and I just can't bring myself to use another weapon going through the area, unless others are going through as well - I switch over to my 3-star Executioner's Machete (from some random event) which reflects 50% damage while blocking, deals 50% more damage when they're below 40% health, and has 90% reduced weight, so they've got a chance to get some of the XP and rewards.
---
Amazing podcast!! My son overheard and is invested now too üòÇ
---
Unpopular opinion: the SBQ is a long enough fight that if you were actively participating, you have more than ample time to get ONE hit in. If you don‚Äôt touch the main objective in a 10+ minute fight, given the additional resources other people are throwing at her to make up for the scaling increase of you being present but not damaging her, at all, then you should not get loot from her.

Tse handmade, tse lever action, tse hunting rifle, aae handmade, aae lever action, aae hunting rifle.

 6 chances to get a gun I truly desire and haven't even come close yet.

fwiw, any game that can keep you focused well enough to stay and keep playing, deserves a better grade than a c+.
---
&gt;for those of us running Junk shield
---
Y tho. Your points are *surely* better used elsewhere if you want defences?
---
Pretty sure its working from the full bar so rad damage is cutting the benefits
---
Don't have to stop and stare ,if i have to grab two pylons....everyone gets eaten.easy.
---
I've bought plans and recipes as well as some legendaries.  I ran across someone selling three star armor in the 400-500 cap range and bought it without hesitating.  Found another player selling similar items for multiple thousands but that seemed too steep.  I've bought 1 star items selling for less than a hundred to scrap.  When vendors first came out, I also grabbed a healing factor serum but haven't seen anyone selling serums other than that.  
---
I sell mostly recipes and plans at 20% of the recommenced price.  People usual buy somewhere between 2-5 plans.  One wastelander bought just under ten bottles of vintage nukashine from me.  Nothing else seems to move.  I thought people would buy disease cures but no one ever has.
---
I'd be interested to hear what other people are looking to buy and what they sell.
---
This is what I've been doing since the release of player vending. Grinding out materials, crafting level 50 sets of powerarmor and selling it (mods Included) for anywhere between 300c to 450c. Tends to sell fairly quickly too
---
Haha Yeah that‚Äôs true but when you have low levels with a hunting rifle shooting at the Sheepsquatch they should focus on the Brahmin, and let the big guns handle big game. As for the rewards to go to everyone, yes agree 100%!
---
DEVS: We are aware of this bug but we do not allow modders to fix or game anymore, so have a fancy orange rug instead.
---
You don't know what one is but you know you don't need it?
---
Stashing all your stuff in a corner in a dropbag to loose weight so you can grab it back after the fighting is done.   Bad idea
---
I think that when setting prices, we should get an option for "caps per x" or "x per cap." That way, things like ammo can be sold at more reasonable amounts.
---
Floor skins on 2x1 stairs would be great too.
---
lolz
---
what you mean is, using the ingame flare gun is letting folks know,
---
GREAT DEALS AND SAVINGS, in aisle 9
---
I'll be honest - this just looks like a fine copy of *killing yourself vs melee enemies: a how to guide*
---
If you still need help I can sort you out... Psn same as here.
---
Although i dont play as you do, fair enough, your playing a raider, have fun
---
Can I ask if PvP has changed?
---
I didn‚Äôt like the release PvP system and decided to not hold off on playing it again to see if it‚Äôs a little more ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù or ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù
---
The idea of human danger and never ending threat is what sells me on online survivals.
---
I‚Äôve sold a lot of one star bloodied weapons, some explosive weapons, some good bats rolls, ultracite ammo, psycho and psycho variants (psychotats etc), stimpaks and plans. Stimpaks sold well at 25 per at the start. Not anymore though.
---
What kind of junk and ammo do you buy?
---
How often? Every day I play.
---
How often do I end up with nothing from at least 20 mins? Never
---
Formula Q is given when you initiate the shutdown code. Someone on your game did that.
---
There is an option to pkay in survival mode now where PvP is always on
---
Once you get to level 50 all the chems are easy to get and stock pile so no one but newbs who don't have the money for them need them
---
To be honest I think the whole thing has slowed down because most people got what they needed in the first weeks of trading
---
Also the legendary vendor has taken away that market as well
---
Yeah, people like this annoy me. If others are there I‚Äôll tag it then once everyone has a hit on it, kill it. I did the Sons of Danes event and one other person showed up just as it started. At the end when the wendigo comes out, he didn‚Äôt even go for it. I tagged it a couple of times then had to use the come here emote to get the person to come over and hit it so I could kill it. Made no sense. Better than someone coming in and one shotting it though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
It'd be cool but the dev time on that is pretty big compared to all the QoL fixes we're lacking
---
I switched my xbox profile back to appear online for this reason. It makes it a lot easier to use group posts to get people for encrypted, campfire etc. also.
---
check your activity gauge from your pipboy and see how close you are to leveling up.
---
This happened to me and I was angry
---
Yeah, right? Otherwise investing any of your time and ammo or strength shooting/hitting (respectively) an enemy before it is killed shouldn't give you any reward before it gets killed by somebody else kills it.
---
Yet these players who think this isn't a problem would be the first ones complaining if you had to 100% kill the enemy yourself to get even the rewards especially with Legendary enemies, if it were changed in the next update ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I suspect they plan to sell us alternate roofs at some point. Glass, probably. It's odd that there are 5 types of wall but only one of roofs. I also keep wondering about the fact that they haven't brought back the PPK (Redeemer? Something like that) even though the 10mm pistol is all by itself in a game with 3 .44 revolvers. I hope they bring it out for everyone as a .38 caliber pistol and don't sell it in the Atom Store, but I might be being silly. The cannon is in-game, so why not the Walther?
---
I agree with others that log cabins seem like they would fit the scenario pretty well.
---
i've used the syringer karma on legendary muties and scorched to see if the drops improve.
---
meh.
---
Serums, plans and ammo works for me.  Also sold some outfits for cheap.  I‚Äôve had people clear up my ammo - 2k 5.56 sold at once and 1k .45 as a batch too.  I‚Äôm not set up to sell near a train station though so people have to actually travel over.  Sold a piece of armor while I was home that was not in machines.  Armor and weapons can sell though as long as you‚Äôre not overpriced.  Have bought from others but not really stocked my machines as much yet with those.
---
Plans &amp; serums is about all I sell, lots of serums
---
But I have sold a couple of guns &amp; some armor as well, now you can inspect I think correctly priced weapons &amp; armor will start selling
---
Give it more time, the event is still new.  Players will start to adept better with this event.  Its what makes this even more of a challenge in the first place.  There might have to be some sacrifices most of the time.
---
it's called added value.. you didn't pay extra for it, but you got it anyway.
---
It was a rhetorical question lol. My point is that it depends almost entirely on luck, whereas farming PvE is guaranteed and has a slew of other benefits. 
---
Pvp can be lucrative, but in general PvE farming is optimal, by a long shot.
---
Sorry that an icon would stop your cap supply in adventure mode. I know that's it's  hard for you to get the 50 caps in survival mode so yes I am "too stupid" to think of my surroundings after 400 hours of game play.
---
As a trader, remember these rules of thumb. 
---
1. The lower the price, the faster it sells. The faster it sells, the more space you have to restock and get money coming in.
---
2. Make your shop area easily accessable. Don't put in a hill. Make it your main pride and joy of your camp. Players love it when other players show them some love. Get them out of the rain and near a warm fire place. I've gotten lots of comments and they explored my camp.
---
3. Think of the location before placing your shop. Will it be a place for customers to come to. Is it near an area that they will do stuff nearby. Plan before you drop that C.A.M.P.
---
4. Put yourself in your customers shoes/boots. Look around your camp and see it your place has a good flow and that items are within reach. That stash box is pretty handy when you are at a vending machine to check and see if you already have the comic of Grognak the Barbarian 9 or that Bobblehead of Luck
---
5. Ask customers when they come to your camp if you are there. Learn from them and figure out how you can make your place better. I ask customers and they tell me that they would enjoy seeing this or that. I put it down and it makes them come back for more stuff.
---
6. Don't log off when a customer is at.your Camp. Wait until they are gone. They might be wanted something you are selling and it could be the big ka-ching in your pocket.
---
ü§ëPlayers go for these mostlyü§ë
---
Bobbleheads and Magazines for the future display or for challenges
---
Plans/Recipes (lower the level of the player, the more plans they buy. I sell mine for 20%-50% of it's value. But if you know it's rare, sell it higher around %75 to %200. Someone is bound to get them. Be patient.)
---
Legendary gear - ‚≠ê‚≠ê/‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê get bought more, don't sell ‚≠ê items. Put the ‚≠ê in the legendary vending machine. Repeat the cycle over and over again.)
---
Items for quest - catch those frogs and make items for players but not to the point where they have to craft it.
---
Stimpaks, radaway, and rad-x
---
Popular serums (learn marsupial or healing factor. Those are big in the community.)
---
ü§ëNot so popular but can still be soldü§ë
---
Drugs (make them around 5 caps and up
---
Ammo (get rid of excess ammo you don't need but keep the prices for each round high enough to make profit. 2 caps or more.)
---
Misc items (no one is looking for those items that much unless it's ore but then again you should smelt it and then bulk junk you don't need.)
---
Junk (bulk items sell better if a price you would be willing to buy from their point of view. Loose items can be sd but keep it 2 caps and above.)
---
Hard to find craftable gear or gear that's unique (that dragon will sell more than that black powder rifle, Tesla rifle sells more than plasma and laser, heavy weapons like the .50 Cal and .308 machine guns are an eye catcher. Just make sure you repair and modify it fully to increase value)
---
Rare food items (these are hard to come by. Sell the ones that you know people will need.)
---
Aid items for healing (they don't sell much but keep the price low. If you don't see them sell, then sell it at a vendors to make profit and more room for stuff.)
---
I do hope this helps out. If you have any questions let me know.
---
Anyone sells junk what works? What about magazines and bobbleheads?
---
Really??
---
i had raider rose gimme full set of raider armor, 1/2 full fusion core too!
---
not a fan of raider armor even if it was lvl 45.
---
I was tanking 2 pylons the last time I ran encrypted and when I died some dude stood over me waiting for me today die so he could steal my bag. He probably saw me in my pipboy popping Nuka Quantum's and Psychotats and concluded that I wasn't contributing..... therefore justifying his need to steal my lunch bag.
---
I am sure this will get downvoted but I completely disagree. 
---
They should definitely get "event completion" rewards and I think Bethesda should do a better job of giving quest completion awards for events like this or SBQ etc
---
But there's no way to eliminate or make automated assessment of level of participation in an event and it doesn't make sense for someone to be able to show up two seconds before boss dies and after everything else has already been completed and still get full boss rewards. 
---
I don't really care if they get loot pool options like how workshop power station completions work but it doesn't make sense for boss/enemy loot. 
---
Maybe a middle ground could be automatic secondary corpse loot from legendary bosses. Kinda like how some of the ghoul swarms work where a second meatpile spawns that has secondary loot that's open world container but not the original loot.
---
Not until you get sick of it, decide you wanna spice it up, and so buy a camera atom skin.
---
That's the genius self-sustaining loop they've created
---
I agree with you on that my husband and I are low levels but, we try to help out at any way we can.  We aren't that brave to go after the main boss but, we try to help out with the other objectives the best we can.
---
  Something from the death of the boss would be nice but, I guess it's really not a team event, huh?
---
Share the wealth if your character was helping.
---
LMAO!!!!
---
Idk why you're specifying platform - this is currently the function of the store regardless of platform
---
Great weapon. I also have a sledge hammer just like that. amazing for the occasional ultra boring whitespring nuke
---
That works for me, I can take both for 400 total?
---
I sell bobbleheads for 50-75 caps, they usually get snatched up. 
---
As far as junk, my best sellers are screws, nuclear waste, black titanium(3-5 caps), plastic, oil, adhesive, springs, gears (2 caps)
---
as long as you don't freak out when it happens to you..
---
Not only the Boss, but any Legendary enemies that spawn during the Event. This would definitely prevent people from intentionally 1HKing all the Legendary enemies at the expense of everybody else, who may or may not possess weapons which can 1HK, or get preoccupied reviving others or gathering food for each biome and actually, you know, supporting the event. And yes, I know it is perfectly okay to just take those damn things out yourself if you're about to die, and you have no choice, but at least this way people don't miss out - most of the time they already spent their damn caps (not to mention time participating) to get there.
---
I've found this too. Do you need to cause a minimum level of damage or is any tag a good tag?
---
Also, does dying mean you have to tag again? Or do tags count through respawns?
---
this happened to me 3 times yesterday wit SB. one time i went back to my camp had to hop servers to get it off my house. DEVS: In this patch we managed to fix 3 major issues and created 37 new issues ENJOY....
---
Kill him now and prevent the rise of Preston!
---
It would be cool if the folders you could pick up in game did this.
---
Well see they should count the amout of legendary things that would appear in the event and only if you finish the quest you will be rewarded 1 legendary random for every legendary you killed if you didn't kill well idk Bethesda should decide what to do next
---
That's what my vampiric .50 cal is for.
---
Yes give this one a prize
---
I sell mags, they are my best sellers along with underarmour, plans, and outfits, I don‚Äôt sell ammo but if I see someone with 2-5K ammo listed then il fast travel to see if it‚Äôs 5.56 and happily buy 1000 for 2 caps a bullet, I‚Äôve never sold chems or bobbleheads as they weigh too much in the stash so I offload them at train station vendors
---
Awesome.. until you think it through. then is tosses out your best junk when unequipped the card? or worse, they lock the card.. ouch..
---
Right!
---
I've had good luck selling full set of modded power armor. I have to put each piece in the machine separately and there is a chance someone will buy only a few pieces and not the whole set.
---
I was referring to additive versus multiplicative. The game is not clear when there is a difference in calculation for example weapon damage perk cards (additive) versus bloody mess (multiplicative). That's something that would have to be datamined so we don't have to guess. Luckily, there is a more simple method to test this: take some overdrive and see if a crit happens without using vats.
---
I still sell a lot of serums.  I do steady business in plans, but I'm still actively adding new ones every time I'm on. Sheepsquatch related plans seem to still do well, as well as the rarer outfit and underarmor plans. 
---
I've sold 60k+ since vending opened, but have spent around 40k, buying plans and novelty items I wanted.
---
It was a rhetorical question lol. My point is that it depends almost entirely on luck, whereas PvE farming is guaranteed and has a slew of other benefits.
---
Pvp can be lucrative, but PvE is optimal, by a long shot. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, you can get all the materials you need without even having to go out of your way just to farm.
---
PS4 vending machine? :)
---
Interesting!
---
Yeah. It has started to get a little boring now with these, however. That's why fighting off Yao guai with it is so exciting - it is at least shot for shot up until you or it dies.
---
Another reason why I carry a courtesy pistol around so when I do the low level events, I can't just superman my way through everything and defeat the purpose of the whole event. I've taken a liking to picking up random low level weapons around the Forest region when I kill something there and making it like my primary no matter where I go and only falling back on my true primaries for if a Sheepsquatch or something ridiculously threatening shows up.
---
Only for one pretty much pointless challenge. I‚Äôd still like to finish it on principle though lol.
---
Well you‚Äôre the one complaining about not being able to see teams. As if everyone needs a flashing sign saying ‚Äúthis person is my friend, he is over there‚Äù. You realise stealth and tactics is a form of skill right? Why should you get a flashing sign because of your ignorance and inability to think for yourself? There is passive mode, which I use (sorry to burst your bubble) and I am unaffected by it. If someone attacks me or there is a bounty, I turn it off and think about the situation. I sneak around my surroundings and make sure they‚Äôre alone. Periodically check the map to see how many people appear around them at times. If you‚Äôre just shooting or killing any random without a second thought then clearly you should consider putting some time into intelligence. They can‚Äôt kill you if you don‚Äôt rise to the bait, if you‚Äôre falling for it then you brought it on yourself.
---
I'm the only one who would love to be able to place turrets like power armor? To help in batlles
---
False! Preston Garvey is already a named scorch in the mire!
---
I‚Äôve heard that you need to be responsible for a certain percentage of the damage in order to get loot but AFAIK that‚Äôs not confirmed. I‚Äôve had the same thing happen, though, so I do think there‚Äôs some kind of threshold.
---
Thats why I have very few junk in my inventory those times.
---
In the Paradise event, I died, with no junk with me. A player waited unitil my time runs out, my body felt down and I saw he searching my loot bag.
---
Then I came back and started shoot me and make the thumbs down emotion... :)
---
People are cheap
---
It's not so hard if you have 1 person willing to swap transfers
---
some1 grabbed 30 magazines and comics from me yesterday @ 100 caps each
---
&gt;Let's give everybody tons of keys and notes they can't drop after they finish specific quests, forcing players to carry around a bunch of unwanted inventory items they'll never use again.
---
And the defense attorney throws his hand in the air and says.. ok, ok, judge, my client is guilty! I can never use that point of law as a defense ever again......
---
That was a dick move. The names of who hadls pylons is in the corner. Those people are obviously good guys.
---
Cheers mate. 
---
This is all I‚Äôve wanted.
---
[](/angrytia)I feel your pain, I missed out on 3 ***legendary drops in one hour the other day myself, one fell into a staircase (The ones leading onto the porches at the whitesprings) so I couldn't reach it, one dropped a drill, and one dropped nothing but chalk.
---
Yea its just a bit annoying trying to switch back and forth between party chat so we emote to tell them to stop and do everything we can to get between them and the computer. If someone did those things to me, i would get the hint.
---
I don‚Äôt think Bethesda is currently even tracking who is ‚Äúactively‚Äù participating in the event. If you‚Äôre in the event radius, you get the event loot. If you damage the boss, you get the boss loot. You‚Äôre asking for them to code a new system so that every event action (use a computer, talk to a robot, kill a certain animal, loot a certain world object, etc) will trigger your ability to loot an enemy that sometimes hasn‚Äôt even appeared yet. Doesn‚Äôt seem like something they‚Äôre going to be able to do any time soon.
---
News flash:
---
Bethesda just made more money than any game provider has ever reported....
---
If you are on PC I can mod your gun with a suppressor. IGN bosshondo.
---
Vanguard gives max bonus at full health...run that with a vampire weapon, healing factor and some +Dr and you can be fairly tanky.
---
Every kiss begins with what?
---
Thank you so much! Episode 2 on the way. :)
---
This bug has been there for months, at least since Patch 5, and I reported it multiple times to Beth no avail.
---
lol that‚Äôs just cruel to post as a response.
---
after 200 levels i maybe able to live without it, super stimpacks get thrown to the ground anyways so i cant even craft it.
---
Cheap items sell more often and rare/powerful items are more sought after? Wow...what a revelation. That most definitely not something completely obvious. Ohh what wise words of wisdom you have.
---
My game completely froze three different times on Xbox last night. All three times I was cooking at my station aty camp. 
---
Killing ghouls on the stairs at WS makes them teleport under the steps so you can't loot them.
---
Constant lag
---
6 T-60 paints
---
BOS combat armor mods/plans
---
4 underarmors
---
6+ outfits
---
1 unique weapon
---
I think there are plenty of BOS items in-game for roleplayers
---
I've somehow gotten two deathclaw hides registered. I may have picked them up off a table rather than an actual deathclaw. I'll keep an eye out for more.
---
Just aim at him, if didnt show the option to invite for team he is already on a team...
---
It is random drop from containers. You can find them at any box, but it will take long time to actualy find 5.
---
Charming.
---
Won't work for console. The better solution is to have a 5 digit 0-9 counter that you can go left to right and up down to change number in that row. Then setting prices is just a few joystick taps. and pc can just click a few times.
---
Grats pulled a vampire explosive faster reload combat shorty off her sweet little ass last night üòâ
---
Can you earn much from salt these days? I know it was worth a lot in the olden days
---
I'm guessing you are one who doesn't appreciate this post.
---
I see.
---
&gt;When going to pick up weights from the gyms... they all disappear
---
Could be because you just switched servers and this loot has already been picked up by you, sometimes it takes it a second to load whether or not you‚Äôve picked something up or not. For example, I can only pick up all the plastic in the high school Gym once per day. Otherwise when I go back it will all be gone, sometimes it will appear to be there and disappear after a short amount of time.
---
Also I saw you didn‚Äôt have the Scrap Bulk bug in there. Much disappoint.
---
On a private server you will have persistent workshops at the least.
---
Been playing since January, I do not fast travel.
---
I walk everywhere - I see dead "settlers" on a regular basis.
---
Funnily enough people pointing out the obvious as if it‚Äôs some amazing words of wisdom...yeah, no.
---
Love it, except for the repeating floor on every level. Did you built top down and bottom up to get the extra levels? I get capped at 3 levels.
---
Are you going to troll every post ?
---
No!! I am still stoked with the new additions! Thanks
---
Awesome stuff, we listened to the last one over Sunday dinner, may do the same with the next one üòÇ
---
The whitesprings mirror embeds itself into brick walls (both sides) so deeply, the only way to remove it is to turn the wall into a doorway to be able to grab it.
---
I was at the whitesprings train station when I started taking fire (adventure). When I went to see what was taking potshots at me it turned out to be a vendor who wanted some traffic...I was annoyed but couldn't resist t60 jetpack plans for 650.... I'll never use them but it was a plan I didn't have so, you know....
---
That would be pretty cool. Or if you could drop a leveled hacked Liberator to go kill some stuff, distract some stuff. Bonus points if it face hugs an enemy (like a Super Mutant) and the other enemies have to come help remove it.
---
Are people going to stop posting the obvious as if it‚Äôs something special?
---
I'm not your teammate, buddy
---
What do you mean persistent workshops? I mean they'll go away every time you get off won't they?
---
Seriously man, it‚Äôs a survival wasteland.
---
Finally someone gets it. All other post - please protect the animals, but there is no motivation to do so, because while you are protecting the animal all other players are killing all the legendaries and getting their loot, while "animal protecting" only gets you the event completion reward.
---
This is really prevalent with Camp Fire Tales. The ‚Äúboss‚Äù is a one shot for the majority of players. Hate doing the entire event and then missing out on that boss loot.
---
I have done this event like 5 times, literally not 1 event specific reward yet
---
Yet more reason to fully remove PvP from adventure mode or add a new game mode that has no PvP.
---
I know it'd make no sense lorewise (not that a lot of the outfits and paints to) but I'd love to have paints for NCR and the legion mostly cause I loved the looks of the salvaged power armour
---
You are a fucking idiot I have only fallen victim A few times I don't want there teammate marked on the map I just want an icon that says the player I can see is on a team
---
The problem with this is that everyone will start to get loot drops, and by everyone I mean: 
---
* low levels that have absolutely no business being there and provide absolutey no help
---
* AFKers, that will show up and simply sit somewhere they are "helping" the smaller objectives, but really arent
---
* and all the other P.O.S players that have demanded a system like this in many other MMOs and ruined the challenge/fun/integrity behind them (do you know how shitty WoW has become since they have started to reward everything now?)
---
The solution is simple, get in a team, or get in area chat, and ask for people to rotate between secondary and primary objectives, when they do, you rotate to the boss. MMO boss mechanics 101. If not, it'll just be a fail and no one will get loot. I'd rather it be that way, or remain the way it is, than become a handout to everyone for absolutely anything.  
---
\*If they "streamline" this game with so many QOL changes that it becomes as pointless and as easy as modern MMOs (this includes passive perk card changes, encouraging easier, exploitable loot, and overall removing the challenge of the game to cater to the percentage of whinny ass players complaining about the difficulty of some aspects of the game \[FYI its a survival game, and no good survival game ever catered to the weak\]  then I'm going to quit. Which is sad, because this is the first game in a while that, although flawed in a "standard fallout sense", is a quality survival game (best since Rust). So quit bitching, get good, and stop asking them to ruin the game... or just quit.
---
I meant you can return to the same world and the workshop will still be there in the state as when you logged out, and also not contested or destroyed by random players.
---
The even sadder part is that they may be missing an opportunity here.
---
I didn't even realise this but I revived someone in the event since I need it for the tadpole mission, and even though your only to your ankles in water in some areas I got the revive in water too! 
---
Very happy for me and a thumbs up from the guy I revived :)
---
I'd love to use brick if the walls didn't look like a crack house bathroom.
---
Do the hunters badge and archers badge and athletic badge those are pretty easy
---
Ah, sorry! I got off after a bit. Had to finish an essay haha. I‚Äôll be on later today.
---
Nice, I have a Ghoul Slayers Sword with SS I occasionally use in WS. My preferred weapon is a Vampires Golf Club it just feels right for that area. Not super effective but fun 2-3 hits tops
---
Not really, if it‚Äôs sitting in my inventory and it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd use then it might as well go. I like my 10mm that I crafted because it‚Äôs always been a friend. But to upgrade it I always scrap and re-build, under the assumption some parts will go over to the next iteration. For the most part though, it‚Äôs just taking up space.
---
People hang around and do nothing after one shot on the ‚Äúboss‚Äù already. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be an issue. Personally I like to kill the mobs to keep my fellow vault dwellers safe while they go HAM on the boss.
---
When you play Fallout enough where you can find such subtle references to it in real life
---
It's better than being a condescending douchebag like you are
---
update should be 8.48 gigs...
---
Ok just let me darm op a bit Cause i just die a project paradise
---
I just put the CAMP (the first placement) on the stairs on the pillar around the 3rd floor. The build sphere lets you build just as far down as it does up.
---
Lower your prices if you want them sold. If stuff doesn't sell for 15c then lower it to 10c for awhile. If it sits in your stash for a week and no one is buying then it doesn't you no good to keep it listed for 15c
---
Survival games like this are the perfect embodiment of "get good or get out" and make *smart* friends to progress properly and easily.
---
Lmao it always gives me a chuckle when people actually take the time to tell Reddit they got stomped for a workshop
---
Im saving up for steel walls i promise!
---
Reminds me of the Fasnacht event. 
---
I was a lower level at the time of the event. Walk around with all the robots and help clearing the adds. Legendary comes out at the end and gets downed in 3 seconds by a couple of higher levels and.... no loot for me.
---
I enjoy that aspect of luck, and the added threat to it. I know how to farm pve pretty efficiently, been playing since beta but repeating the same thing over and over, or just killing AIs was something that originally killed me enjoyment for the game. The added mystery of how the situation will go is a big reason I PvP
---
Try Scan and Repair, then Update.
---
Lol yea mate, gt terryboff. Wont be on for a good few hours, but send me a message and I'll hit you up. Think I have around 20k rn, but I'm always crafting.
---
Yes, because a sign saying ‚Äúthis person has a team‚Äù is definitely miles different. I forget that whenever I go out for a drink or go bowling with friends we all put on our matching ‚ÄúWE ARE FRIENDS‚Äù badges so that even if they‚Äôre not stood next to me they know I‚Äôm with a friend. And you‚Äôre calling me an idiot despite the fact you fell for obvious traps multiple times? Your insults might hurt if I thought you had the intelligence to back it up
---
Yeah, I read that as well. Unfortunately it says "63.61 GB of free space is required". I have a PC as well (the laptop is actually the wife's), but I didn't pay attention to the size of the update when it downloaded on it.
---
I've since uninstalled 76 on the laptop and I'm hoping that fixes it. I'll know in a few hours I guess.
---
Earlier I followed a Yao Guai around Atkos protecting it from all manner of bullshit while the other 6-8 players ignored it and instead focused on the Alpha.
---
I had to backoff for 5 seconds to spam stimpaks after a sudden Sentry bot took a huge chunk off my health and of course the Yao Guai dies in that time.
---
Of course thumbs down and angry face emotes from the other players, who at least got their 1* wood armour from the Alpha while I attempted to babysit the creature - if you want the event rewards at least attempt to do the event ¬¨_¬¨
---
True true, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be much of an issue just thinking of why they might not consider it, I‚Äôm the same as you I get one hit on the alpha bit then I take out all the mobs because I don‚Äôt hit as hard as they do
---
I‚Äôve gotten good mods from scrapping low level items , I don‚Äôt think it makes any difference tbh
---
You have just as much chance of learning a mod scrapping a level 15 as you do scrapping a 45.
---
First attempt is a fresh install, but if that doesn't work I'll try that next, thanks.
---
You can get the mods from the level 15 handmades. That's what I did and now I have nearly all the mods except for the true stock mod. Sometimes ( not often ) you will get no mod from scrapping a gun.
---
Oh wow that's wild. Well hopefully things continue to go well for you.
---
Last night as I was rebuilding my camp, I heard footsteps. When I turned around it was a feral ghoul at my vending machines. I guess I don't just attract customers but the wasteland.
---
But most important, legendary enemies shouldn‚Äôt go under the ground all the time tacking away my loot.
---
Don‚Äôt ask for any fucking nerfs.    That‚Äôs my feedback.
---
Hi There! Over the last few days I have been playing a lot and I did notice something that all of the 'legendary rich farmlands' appeared in servers where a Nuke has been launched and is in the process of subsiding, AND players have been on that server for a few hours - or more like what it seems to me is that the server has been cleared of a good amount of primary enemy spawns, and now that this particular server has been up a while, new enemies spawn in and seem to go legendary more often.
---
This is most apparent at the Clubhouse where if the ghoulies are spawning in as high level Diseased, where I really cashed in (granted the levels of the legendaries are lower but I was still getting 2, and 3* weapons and armor in there).
---
Has anyone else experienced this?
---
You are correct! Here is a screenshot from FO76Edit:  [https://imgur.com/a/kOujfRR](https://imgur.com/a/kOujfRR). The magnitude for "Fortify Crit Dmg" is 15 and the magnitude for "Overdrive: Extra Damage" is 15.
---
No you‚Äôre absolutely right - but with Arktos - I actually defend the animal so the event will complete - this means most of the time I am following it and I never get to see the Alpha boss so I don‚Äôt get any loot other than the quest rewards - so I miss out on the legendary
---
I'm not sure I understand what you mean - with regards to context of my post (it's early so I blame that)
---
ROFLCOPTERMAO‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è
---
yep. I've checked the leveled lists
---
The mr fuzzy toys count as teddy‚Äôs for the scrapping challenge so just head to Camden park, in the area where the vendor and the park boss robobraim is there‚Äôs tons of them
---
You have the exact same routine as me mate lol. People say hemlock holes workshop for acid, but yao guai are the way. Especially since you get a bunch of springs to sell too! I've actually built my camp under the broken bridge near mountainside, so I'm getting 10 to 15 acid everytime I go to my camp... and I get acid (and a laugh) everytime some unsuspecting customer spawns in wanting to use my machines and is greeted with a couple glowing Yao guai they have just force spawned üòÇ
---
You should see me playing, I clean everything, OCD style! LOL
---
See my reply to [imprezobus](https://www.reddit.com/user/imprezobus/) below. There is no need to test because overdrive doesn't fortify crit chance anymore (as of 4 months ago). The Wiki information is not accurate.
---
And I can craft like 70k a week, but that is doing nothing else but solid grinding.
---
I never said that at all - I‚Äôm not a lowbie or a noob - I‚Äôve been playing since Beta :) I save what I can and the rest I move to a mule and scrip the next day etc. it‚Äôs really not hard lol
---
neat. whish I was on pc
---
Not many will know that. Especially if it's a new player. So you are going say that a person new to something is going to automatically know. Also we have younger players online. Young as in kids and teenagers. Im willing to help them out and managed to teach a few of them. They really appreciated it afterwards. So to let you know, no not everyone will know.
---
Marcus is from Fallout 2, not Tactics.
---
So when you log onto a private server, you will always be on that same server? I thought I heard it wouldn't be that way
---
Yes yes, of course. Pander to the masses so people can feel special despite regurgitating the same useless ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. Cheap things sell, rare things are in demand, have a camp in some place among a Main Street. These are most definitely not obvious things. I mean I often go out to buy milk and decide to go to the middle of nowhere rather than a shopping district. And would happily pay ¬£1000 for a pint of milk because that‚Äôs clearly what it‚Äôs worth. Mind blowing.
---
Gonna have to agree that they either need to be reworked to deal extra incendiary damage using the explosive perk card as a buff or just need to be removed entirely. Weapons that defy the rules of weapon combat are not healthy for the game period. I mean the explosive flamer is basically an extremely fast mini gun with no spool up.
---
I can agree with you there. I‚Äôve done it quite a bit now and still haven‚Äôt unlocked the backpack. I would enjoy the event more of people actually focused on the event instead of the legendary loot
---
tl:dr got stomped, opening salt mine.
---
Shotguns were already ruined, stop asking for more damn nerfs.
---
Actually if you want that to happen just take one or two shots on the big payout (loot) I.e scorched beast, sheepsquach, etc than go back to doing what you‚Äôre normally doing and still get the loot
---
I feel ya there, bed time after Netflix. I will hit you up via messenger and we can figure out a time to meet in game. It's 5:15 am for me so I won't be on for a while as well lol, but I've been needing a steady supply and shall look forward to future business. GT AquaticPlace960
---
Yeah, turns out 600hrs is quite enough :D
---
Biv dailies to sell the recipes you already know
---
You can already, 
---
Step 1: place 2 fondations on the ground and place a brick door frame wall between the 2 pieces. Then place another one at the same spot, the 2 bricks sides will be touching and you will have white walls on the opposing sides.
---
Step 2: replace the door frame with a normal wall.
---
Step 3: there is none, you're done!
---
If you're on PC you can come and see my camp, it's setup in this way. I also have garage doors "inside" brick walls so I can close my windows nuclear bunker style. My IGN is the same as here.
---
Oh nay...
---
wow 100 that's a lot as I generally carry about 20-30 as my max except for the screws, gears, springs.. Instead, my hording is like 12k ultracite 5  mm, 200 2 mm, 10 Fusion cores, and those 40-50 Plasma cores.
---
Never, ever do I drop Plastic, Fiber Optics, and Ballistic Fiber.
---
The last update was like 8GB
---
I actually pvp'd a guy for the first time who had an explosive laser rifle. That combined with sentinel armor made him extremely op. But we killed him a few times and when we went to his junk bag I was granted with 200 pounds of springs gears screws etc. But yeah they should have never been in the game. Even if I had 4 of them I would not be mad if they got rid of them all( doupers douped them anyway)
---
Hypocritical much? You posted about Class Freak not effecting Speed demon. This has been known for a long time. (Annoying AF yes should be fixed) and here you are preaching about pointing out the obvious...
---
You have every right to post that and the OP has every right to try and be helpful to players trying to vend thier wares. Just because it's obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to everyone.
---
Chill out and let people be helpful. Players old and new visit here for advise let them get it.
---
If you have a TS weightless minigun (no explosive) I could buy it from ou :)
---
yeah with random strangers i'd tell your team to switch to area chat vs team chat.
---
your team becomes a part of a larger group when you do events..
---
18+ game. If a parent bought it for their kids without that kid having an even vague understanding of how the world works, then the parents should re-evaluate themselves. And anyone 18+ who doesn‚Äôt understand the basics of ‚Äúshopping‚Äù should probably do the same.
---
Depends on how you define bored.  Bored b/c you are one hit killing everything, or bored b/c you want a different visual?
---
AA grognak axe, deathclaw gauntlet, mole miner gauntlet do respectable damage.
---
For a bit more challenge, change out to a lower damage weapon
---
L88, my primary at the moment is a 1\* Vampire switchblade.
---
Somewhat agree. I sold my level 20 Perfect Storm and my level 10 Silver Lining armor with no remorse whatsoever, but can't bring myself to part with my Order of Mysteries weapons, which I'll never use, even though they can be upgraded to lvl 50.
---
Two of the three solutions proposed here aint nerfs, they are tweaks to loot tables that would make the competition fair for all participants.
---
The third ain't nerf too, its a fix, there is one type of weapon that doesn't follow the rules rest of them do and simultaneously is unobtainable. 
---
Same set of rules should apply to everyone, and I don't favor any directions. If they would be "nerfed", my equipment would heavily decrease in value, so I believe I am honest when discussing this issue.
---
Imo everyone should get to loot. Someone killed that big mutant before you got to location? Probably have something on them.
---
Do you also wear the wolf fedora with and some shades?!?   Cause I do! Lol
---
.45 ammo and whatever junk I need at the time
---
i teleported to it once, the other 3 times i didnt, would love a fix for so i can play with my brother.
---
i've seen it at harpers ferry, watoga(s)  &amp; R&amp;D..
---
I find the best way to deal with underground enemies is a Nuka grenade. I regard it was my bunker buster!
---
TMYK
---
Yes because asking if something is a bug or is intended is akin to pointing out how ‚Äúlife‚Äù words. Well done of being able to check through post history by the way, have a gold star.
---
Vanguard Metal, or combat, with weight reduction perks, and whatever third one that makes you happy.
---
I managed only once in my 204 levels to successfully notice and obtain the blooms, the quest and spawn is broken but BGS don't realise or more likely don't GAF.
---
We can build spotless Power Armor suits with technology in them that‚Äôs even far past our own by several decades but we can‚Äôt build a wall that has fresh paint?  Wtf...
---
Agree with sleepy, graphics-wise, sleepy has it right - all of it :)
---
Sometimes it's the little things.  
---
Teddy bears, gnomes, visual gags/references to other games or movies.....
---
Yup thats the combo. They aren't unkillable, they just playby  a different ruleset.
---
Four different ones I got, one of them personal drop. Assassin, Vampire, Furious and Two Shot explosives.
---
I'm against taking people stuff away because they worked for it. This should be fixed, not taken away. Fixed by implementing appropriate legendary mods for energy weapons. AA should be modified as part of this too.
---
I def keep stuff due to nostalgia. I have my first favorite drop, a suppressors 3* knife that while isn‚Äôt fabulous, was great for me. And my most nostalgic drop, a 1* bloody 50. Passed it down to my son!
---
&gt;18+ game. If a parent bought it for their kids without that kid having an even vague understanding of how the world works, then the parents should re-evaluate themselves
---
I agree with this. Despite disliking your previous troll posts. It's spot on and very true
---
How about free walls? The game feels empty but the cash store is always full.
---
No one else showed up.
---
Location is important. So many times I've wasted caps fast travelling to see over priced good so I mostly stick to checking vendors close by.
---
This!
---
Fixed good, removed bad, you can't accept stuff being removed from other people without agreeing to randomly loose your precious stuff yourself.
---
I actually mostly sell apparel and plans and that‚Äôs how I make almost all of my caps :) people always buy rare outfits!
---
My other mods appear to work fine (I played for a couple hours last night and just ran around and checked if each one was working). The only one that I am not 100% sure about is the  "Reasonable Scorchbeast Scream Effects." I don't currently have the time to test them individually and record them but hopefully I can play again soon!
---
this may not help you now....however, the price of SSDs of all makes have come down in price big time.  you may want to invest \~$100 into a larger SSD and pop it in there.  And yes, you can upgrade laptop storage.
---
I'm not asking for nerfs, I'm asking for market fix.
---
Your fucking feedback sucks.
---
Plans and serums and rare clothing are the best
---
Could be wrong, but I heard a rumor once you complete mayor for a day, that pretty much stops.
---
On the other hand, the L50-80 SBs  .... :)
---
People are missing out here - use a Vampire's and you'll never need to stim again.  Pole hooks and fire axes have better mods than super sledges IMO - because they have armor piercing type mods.  Pole hook has good reach too.  The other side is going unarmed - deathclaw gauntlet, power fist, meat hooks and mole miner gauntlets.  Combat knifes are good for 1H melee, fast and high DPS.
---
Mutations are also a must - Twisted Muscles is the minimum, Talons if you're going unarmed.
---
Shotguns were bugged and fixed, not nerfed.
---
Do you perhaps have any settlements that need our help?
---
Id certainly prefer fixed of course.
---
\&gt; Mr Spooky ...
---
  That would make Camden another good source....
---
Changing how it functions is a nerf.
---
I completely forgot about that mission. Completed it with my friend who refused to help complete it for me. Im level 201 now and still havent done it because i forgot about it.
---
And that's what I found out. I put certain items in the machines and the ones that sold, I made notes on. I wish we had a ui that shows us what items are selling more than others.
---
I noticed MaxsonBattlecoat.ba2 and PetterPAlight.ba2 don't work in Misc. BTW you should try Perk Loadout and Chat mod if you haven't. Better inventory and icon tag are also very nice QoL mods.
---
Returning player here. Does tagging not get you the reward? What do you have to contribute to get the reward?
---
You might add a usb drive as a temp drive to hold the download
---
I don‚Äôt know if Bethesda‚Äôs launcher allows you to add locations.  But steam does
---
we really need some kind of help here maybe even just giving out scriptfrom an event would work well on events you're supposed to get a legendary from
---
Biv's recipes and plans do come in handy. Made alot of profit from those.
---
I do the secondary objectives by just shooting the Legendary once and once again when it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs ‚ÄúLegendary heal‚Äù and I still get all the loot while still completing the event I know it‚Äôs a bit of an asshole thing to do but it‚Äôs the wasteland you do what you can to survive.
---
And just like a lot of things that have sold and how much they were would be nice too!
---
Ypu should add some balconies and decks or overhangs etc. To add some dimension to the tall walls :)
---
With the amount of bloodied builds running with nearly no hp, being able to do radiation damage is extremely good, so while a handmade has the potential for more ammo, and a slightly faster fire rate, in PvP a radium rifle is absolutely stellar.
---
I do not recall specific official information, but I would think the point of a private world (which was said to be planned to be made available as a service hosted by the developers) is that you own that one particular world instance and can do whatever you want there, including modding it. As opposed to the regular servers where you are placed randomly on one, and have to share it with other people.
---
OMG yes. This would help out so much. üòÅ
---
Better solution:  remove pvp from the game.  I for one am tired of all the endless drama that catering to the pvp set has caused.   Let‚Äôs simplify‚Äîremove pvp and not have to listen to cries for more nerfs by those who lose in pvp.  PVPers can migrate over to Tom Clancy‚Äôs Rainbow 69 or, well, anywhere but here.
---
I overpay for the ones I don't have. Someone had quite a few at 500 and a Nuka cola dark resippie at 1500. Of course I spent over 3k on alcohol recipes lol
---
Will add you later also. My tag is. XSxSKETCHYxDx
---
All things being equal you'll get more dps out of a handmade every time. The radiation damage effects literally nothing in PvE. A good Radium rifle is an excellent counter to Sentinel in PvP, and is a death sentence for a Bloodied Sentinel.
---
Rename the camera from whatever they call it. Make sure you don‚Äôt have it favorited.
---
Did other players find your post helpful?
---
I'd say yes
---
Do a lot of people already know about the Speed Demon bug?
---
Yes, most of us do
---
Do other players find this post helpful?
---
Do a lot of people already know how to run a succesful shop?
---
Yeah we do
---
I appreciate the gold star it's very kind of you but not everyone is going to find vending tips as obvious as you think they are. 
---
There's nothing wrong with trying to be helpful. Try it you might like it
---
Did you get their name - maybe you can add them and join their server.
---
in the bog, near the quarry i try to start crap with the mirelurk queen, and the SB that flies around there then fight whose left.
---
the funny thing is, the fight usually between the mirelurks and robots or scorched.
---
it can get dicey too. i did this with a behemoth, a mirelurk and the SB, but instead pulled agg from behemoth! lolz
---
Probably best to get the plans, perk up scraper and weapon crafting and go to town making and destroying them - make the lowest level, the mods come all the same.
---
Farming is probably not possible, but i got 2 from a SBQ fight last nigh :)
---
I don‚Äôt know how or why this comment posted here? Lol
---
If you are PS4:
---
  Not sure of its level, but I have a 1\* Vampire Lever action in my vending machine.  Believe it is modded w/ a scope.
---
Will be on after 10p tonight.  Camp is just off the road on a power line tower ENE of Bolton Greens.  aj ninetyeight.
---
I honestly wish you could use stimpacks on the brahmin and/or on the friendly creature in project paradise.
---
The brahmin can summon the courage of the skyrim horse and try to fight a sheepsquatch (fuck you Nuka Cowla).  I've seen the friendly creature (mirelurk when I was basically soloing the C area) run into a corner and get gangbanged by stingwings, robots, and anglers.  Not really much you can do in those circumstances, but being able to heal them would buy a little time.
---
Hell, if there was a recipe for a Creature Stimpack specifically for that I'd be happy.
---
i like stabilized too.. üëç
---
Most of this is good IMO.
---
Things I disagree on:
---
1) Pricing and a lower bound. I see a lot of people price ridiculously low. Why grind for hours if your going to sell the spoils of your work for pennies. There is a learning curve to pricing in regards to what weapons are popular / what effects are popular / what is trash worthy. I have been trading for 5 months and I am still learning things as I go. Not all items are created equal even if they are both 1/2/3\* and the same weapon. A rule of thumb for me is that if I can't sell it for 500 caps I turn it into scrip. An example of a 500 cap item would be something like an 1\* max lvl AA hatchet. AA is a popular effect but not many people use a hatchet. 
---
2) Turning all 1\* items into scrip. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. There are some really really good 1\* weapon / effect combos that people want. Most of my legendary sales are in 1\* items of popular weapons with popular effects. Players between lvls 50-100 are looking to find max lvl items that fit their build / play style and a lot of times they don't want to spend all of their caps on a 2\* or 3\* item. A 1\* with the right effect is what I call a starter build item. It gets you 75% of the way there but only costs you 10-20% of the caps.
---
There‚Äôs unfortunately not a lot of places they spawn naturally that I know of - I found one in the room wit rose on the table behind madigan one time but it‚Äôs always a different weapon so I ended up buying the plan - I would buy it off another player instead of the vendors - I got one for 1k - they do take a lot of materials tho - even the low level ones
---
Nah, I'm on xb1
---
I doubt you leave your moms basement to go out and cats are not actual friends. It's not about falling for traps it just gets annoying like you are having Deathclaw Gauntlet kid keep hitting you while at the train station maybe I should join them if I can't beat them ( due to leaving pacifist mode on) but I will aim for the head to see if they are on a team fast travel away circle back and take out the high level teammate first (probably you)  then the low level teammate ( or are you the bait).
---
3 star for melee, 2 star for ranged.
---
With over 300 stimpacks they should get a chair.
---
Mothman can you please stop sitting on that rock watching me sleep it creeps me out.
---
Well, I mean that would make sense I suppose. Let's hope!
---
Oh boy, yes... I would change alot! This is my build for Unharmed.
---
S-15
---
3 Iron fist (change for a one or two hand weapon)

3 Barberian

3 Martial artist

3 Bloody mess
---
3 Class freak (I dont know why people use mutations without this....)
---
3 Serependy
---
I've yet to meet anything besides SBQ that survives more then 3 punches...
---
I still regret getting rid of my Bunker Buster and Pyrolyzet... I keep eyeballing those unique one star armors in my inventory as scrip, but I can't bring myself to pull the trigger
---
(O^O)
---
Stop changing the rules for those of us in PVE just because you lose in PVP.
---
I always craft the lowest lvl for the purpose of getting mods through scrapping.
---
I'm currently 155 and rocking a bloodied melee build so my stats are somewhat similar.. radicool is a dope C perk as it increases dmg (S) based on your rad count, might want to think about swapping that one. Also, I kept 3 pts in P for quick swapping lock pick perks (normally the veggie/refractor/glow sight). Also I craft, so i have 6 pts in I to give me some creativity there.. I am HEAVILY mutated, all of them to be exact, so if that kinda thing floats your boat there are perks you can play around with in terms of your survivability within the E and A section
---
Let's hope they will... I feel a little lost when I'm asked to "long pipe-gun" as an objective... Especially in Project Paradise....
---
I was blessed alright, with a ton of junk! Even worst, duplicated junk!
---
I had blue screen too and I thought: ‚Äúoh my, I‚Äôve broken the console‚Äù (because neither the home button was working) 
---
Then game freezed and crashed in the new event, 2 times in a row. These bugs bother me but I hope Bethesda will fix‚Äôem all (after the release of new bugs lol)
---
Watoga train station. Bought it last week.
---
I dont knie if i sent thuis already but 400 caps is good i just need to farm more ammo sinds i just used a bit too much
---
What is ur damage on ur primary melee weapon. I was thinking of doing a bloodied build but not sure where to start I‚Äôm level 111
---
Wow, man.. the interaction between fellow players is such a large part of the game..
---
I met a level 91 that played in this mode.. he was say, wow. Why didn't I do this before????
---
PC "FarPlace" join up..
---
I believe formula p revives some health to the friendly creatures also while doing the fight
---
Green beans in chili? Shouldn't this be posted in r/WTF
---
and a fix for the buggy french display........ !!!!!!
---
I keep seeing one spawn at the red rocket truck stop.
---
I'm guessing that Formula Q will either show up as they update the event, or they decided it wasn't worth having multiple formulas for the time being.
---
I run this build. I quite like it. Some changed from yours.

Well I remember playing Half Life in Kindergarden with my dad, brothers and my cousin.

Still I hate to deal with kids in games.
---
PS: Let us drop-destroy duplicate keys.
---
Because we BEACH BOYS.
---
Okay thanks for clearing that up
---
All good. Add me PSN Earthsnightmare when you're ready
---
if a ‚Äúkid‚Äù is attacking me then I do this thing called ignoring them. The pathetic amount of caps you get for pvp isn‚Äôt worth it and I‚Äôd rather do what I intended to do an move on. It‚Äôs called having a choice? If you‚Äôre falling for traps then it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault than your own. You were the one who engaged them, so you deal with the consequences. Or would you rather have a hissy fit of ‚ÄúI killed someone then their friend killed me, boo hoo‚Äù
---
Awesome idea.
---
Are you on ps4 I have seen a camp there numerous times.
---
Gears. Screws. Lead. I‚Äôve had success selling these only. 1 cap each.
---
I reach 2500K with the build below, plus Unwilding set and bloodied gauntlet
---
This. Can't upvote enough each single post lately about that topic.
---
It's kind of funny that there are ppl telling Beth what would they made to buy atoms - all those plenty ideas which are immersive, well tough and (if done right) eye candys - but Beth be like

*"Here another floor, same as we had before but it's a diffrent colour - BUY IT! And dare you to have topiaries for free!"*
---
I really love fallout, i really have so much fun in appalachia, but how they deal with eventual customers is just sad.
---
Shouldnt take long expect a friend req. from niek1516
---
all the hair in the atom store is literally copy and pasted stuff from 4 so this arguments doesn't really hold up
---
You would literally never START troubleshooting a connection to game server, at the ISP. Especially for a common problem affecting numerous players world wide, on numerous different ISP's.
---
Do you even know the layers of the TCP/IP Stack? Do you know what ping time and latency are? Port forwarding? 
---
Not that it matters. The problem is Bethesda. It's always been Bethesda. They just dont have mods papering over it this time.
---
Already did those. I'm looking to get more plans from the tadpole vending machine, which means more badges than just the minimum.
---
I would want them to be non-combatant scan &amp; detect eyebots that have 25 lbs of storage. They wouldn‚Äôt be detectable by other players, and you could access their inventory via buttons while in pip boy.
---
Not perfect, but what is?
---
Daily legendary income &gt; daily legendary scraping
---
This will result in moving things to mule every day or two, because you can't accept some of us need bigger daily scrip pool, so bethesda will not increase it. This is like talking to wall.
---
All you have to do is get on hit on the boss and loot is yours. I think this is the best way. And please don‚Äôt change it and rune the game
---
Platform?
---
Don‚Äôt forget to say what platform you‚Äôre on
---
Most of what sold initially was consumables and plans. I keep these in my machine so that no matter who shows up, there is something they may want. However, most of my profit comes from the selling of legendary items. On my main I usually have 10-15 legendary weapons and 5-10 legendary armor pieces for sale. Some days I may only sell 1-3k caps worth of stuff on others more. Had one day were I sold 10k worth of items, bought the signs and letters plan (finally) to make cap space and then sold another 5k.
---
There were so many effing radstags, over twenty at any time
---
Yeah, I did most of the game solo, and enjoyed it. But if they want this to have any sort of endgame life, they're going to have to come up with some way of grouping that doesn't involve hunting through Discord. Seems like lazy design to me.
---
Well at least we know a little of what to expect from nuclear winter with these spoiler T-T (The weapon mod description in challenges is worst though -_-)
---
PS4
---
I thought once the Alphas were out the protection phase was over and it was run around and try to tag all the alphas time.
---
All Two Shot weapons and explosive weapons were nerfed, largely because of pvp losers whining about TSE shotguns.
---
Go play anthem
---
I stopped doing that event because of the insanity and cost. Rewards just aren't worth it when theres so many better events out there. It is good if you want to kill a ton of robots for xp and mats though.
---
Wait what ?
---
I never said that - I have also said that I would welcome a daily scrip increase and a total increase to how much we can carry. But it‚Äôs also not that big a deal to move things if you need to
---
Also if you need Any fusion cells (plz take these) i sell those for 1 cap per 5 cells Maybe leds
---
Treasure maps, heart of the enemy quest. Both of these drop gauss quite often. Or, as stated learn, build (with super duper maxed), scrap.
---
Awesome thanks for the heads up
---
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that the only thing that works is:
---
- Plans and recipes at a reasonable price
---
- Some types of ammo for 1
---
- Fusion cores for 100 or under 
---
- 3 star legendaries for 200 to 1000
---
- Good explosive legendaries for 5000+
---
Everything else is just wasting time and space.
---
Ugh man, I've been using bloodied tambo and this shit just breaks enemies souls once I'm 20% or lower. Upwards close to 500, comfortably I'd say 465 but I'm not logged on rn so no definite scaling answers. On avg I sit with 50-80% radiation, with my mutations and perks, and low health my dmg is high enough to brawl out ANY fight. Can even hang in nuke zone wearing rad suit so the armor isnt terribly important with this build
---
That's how SWTOR handles theirs and I dunno if that would be best. Maybe there could be different "tiers" like in Project Paradise and each tier takes up "space" on your team. Like an eyebot or dog doesn't count at all like how dogmeat works in FO4 while a Sentry Bot or Sheepsquatch takes up two player slots. It would kind of remind me of Operation Anchorage with its squad tokens
---
Default vendor prices for items like Stimpaks are stupidly high. Plans as well. It's not obvious Stimpaks should be priced 10-20c each diluted 5c each most plans @ half the default price rare plans are a sellers market.
---
You're not buying milk
---
The Relay Tower DP-B5-21 Southwest from Whitesprings spawns one on one of the Shelfs. Sometimes there is Laser Rifle or so so just dont pick it up and Server Hop for a new Roll.
---
the inventory in this game is such a goddamn mess lol
---
I've sold a heap of acid, aluminium, steel, springs and lead... Only to then run around using up my ammo and going oh crap what have I done haha
---
Look at op's link and start from there for ideas, imo not a bad start with his prebuild stats
---
I can see your point there. That's why I try to keep things that are worth value high and items of least value low.
---
True that some legendary items are good but sometimes if you find something that has added benefits then it sells. I put ‚≠ê items inside and it rarely sold. But ‚≠ê‚≠ê sold like wild.
---
AMEN
---
Fair enough
---
Mine, uh, totally won't be used to make a robot brothel. Totally. Uh, won't.
---
Totally won't.
---
Really.
---
Frankly I am glad Bethesda kept at least one promise and that is no human npc
---
excellent news
---
Sucks that people don‚Äôt really buy mini nukes cause they weigh so much set them up for 20 caps each at my camp and no one ever bought them so I took them off sale
---
Its always been like that. For any mob.  I've never been able to figure out it.  I use a tesla to tag at times and sometimes even thought I tag them and do visible damage I wont get credit.  Honestly I just think its good old server lag/poor code like most things wrong with the game but I always try to hit twice if I can.
---
I‚Äôd just want something to carry loot as an external backpack. Either that or have it as a travelling ‚Äústash‚Äù box that also gives you the option to scrap. Perhaps even have them be able to equip certain perk cards like hacking/lock picking. So that they could unlock things instead and free up some extra perk space for me.
---
Good idea
---
Ammo at 1 will not make any profit so 2 will give you profit. The system is not working correctly all the way.
---
The rest is what I usually sell as too. So I see that we are on the same idea.
---
Should still get loot if you tagged and died.  I tagged and died and have gotten loot before.
---
OMG I need that recipe badly. I want to make nuka cola products.
---
The right solution sucks I play high a lot üíÄ
---
I've been trying to find the link to the message boards where they posted this to no avail. Hopefully someone can help a brother out and post it.
---
I still haven't figured out what TIL stands for.
---
Sounds like a plausible idea for robot companions. You would have to build your companion but also have to repair them as the take damage. Possibly mod their personality (pack mule, security or scout (highlight enemies for example). Not sure how the servers would hold but sound more of a possibility than human npcs and would fit considering the theme. Not sure how animals would work other than base companions.
---
Yes we are, even on ammo, I‚Äôm talking about found ammo, not crafted.
---
And you know why we are at the same page? Because I and my friend have a fuck ton of ingame hours + visiting other shops.
---
I'll will always buy Berry mentat, grape mentats, disease cures, and antibiotics if reasonably priced.
---
I would love the option for vertical 1/2 walls, we already have horizontal 1/2 walls....
---
It would allow for greater flexability in building and filling in gaps
---
I‚Äôm not looking to make a ton off anything I sell. None of my plans are over 100c, most are either 50c or 20c. I sell my mini nukes for only 5c. I‚Äôve had people buy them before. I also hardly ever sell them unless I accidentally pick them up.
---
[](/lcehappy)Campfire glitches, welcome mat glitches, and a very steady hand.
---
I agree dont go to these events with Junk. Its simple. They are asshats for doing it but it is ultimately on you!
---
Aha I wish I needed them as that's a good price but I don't use fusion cells. Thanks anyway
---
I have a floating camp in a electric steel tower so it's like some sort of urban treehouse. Marsupial Mutants only, No Normies allowed
---
Lol no worries mate. I'm UK, so it's only 2pm here ha! I'll hit you up when I'm back and well figure out a time were both on üëç
---
I have 2500+ just wasting my stash space
---
Two of your three options are nerfs.
---
It seems to be worse after the last patch.  I was always loading into stations before the robot vendor or scrip machine load into the world but never had invisible enemies until this patch.  They really seem to wing it when it comes to their patch testing.  I love new content but hate that there are new bugs or old bugs returned every single time.
---
Thanks for the suggestions! Those are definitely nice mods (I have tried them all except the chat mod which I don't personally want in the game). I don't play much anymore so I keep my mod list short and simple so that it works in between patches and doesn't require updating (I forget to check too &gt;.&lt;).
---
I do fell kids shouldn't play it but I can understand teenagers who are older say like in high school. As long as they know what they are doing.
---
I tried... question 9 is broke and wont let me turn it in
---
X box mate. And I've been there for ages and have only ever had a couple times that I couldnt place my camp... I didnt think anyone else was daft enough to camp there with the yao guai ha!
---
Only problem with number 2 is I see so many camps at whitesprings now I feel left out :/ 
---
I built mine near sunshine meadows for easy water access, a farm ground to build and the workshop nearby, but that's on the other side of the map. I do get customers at least.
---
Plus I don't have to worry about it being nuked lol
---
You‚Äôre going to have to tell me how! Pm me. :)
---
*Come back tomorrow*
---
I thought I knew all the tricks. But I thought they were nerfed long ago.
---
Stimpacks are fine a dozen in the world. Being dropped my enemies, given for completing most quests, not to mention all the mirrors/chem boxes. They‚Äôre things you just accumulate at speed with no effort. Common sense dictates that if you have a lot of something for no effort, then it has little to no value.
---
Especially if your using a controller.. oh man the time it takes to had a freebie away if it's a mutation serum
---
But it's not YOUR event. Its a server event. You may have walked in and triggered it, but it doesn't say Bizzology's custom event. Hop away, or don't play an MMO and expect a servers worth of people to serve you. You play however you want.
---
I'll wait a few minutes to start a few different events. After that you better be paying caps for MY time as I know that myself and my equally equipped buddy will be doing a huge percentage of the boss and adds damage.
---

No, it should be posted to [r/greenbeanswithchili](https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/R390EId)
---
I have seen invisible enemies, video glitches and now lag issues...But hey we have backpacks... Fucking game...
---
Pfft.
---
People threw their TSE's into fissure sites after they were nerfed, too. If it's not OP it's trash isn't a balanced viewpoint.
---
I make sure to deposit all valuable loot like screws and fiber before any event were I might die. So if I die feel free to take my loads of steel.
---
I just saw one of those hive things at Kate's Grindhouse or whatever its called, I swear I don't remember seeing it there before.
---
How do you know its world wide though? It could just be a European problem. The point is no one in this post knows what is wrong and are trying to pretend like they do. The thing works for me and a lot of other people.
---
I mean, you can get 30 springs if you kill a few yao guis, that's all really worth it.
---
Insult bot tho??
---
Yeah it sucks when I have to spent a hour or two getting my mods back after an update or the game is "unplayable" because I'm spoiled by the QoL mods haha.
---
This looks cool! What kind of weapons do you use? I have not encountered many unarmed weapons except mole minining gauntlet!
---
PVP has always been gank or be ganked
---
I think 13+ depends on a childs maturity and parental judgement of thier maturity. I wouldn't let my 5yr old play 76. He has minecraft and Plants vs Zombies (chat turned off).
---
If my 13yr old Daughter actually liked video games I'd let her play with no chat option. It all depends on the ability of a child to understand the content. I'm not a fan of unmonitored chat and my children for obvious reasons.
---
Here is what I said about this in another post:
---
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that the only things that work are:
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Plans and recipes at a reasonable price
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Some types of ammo for 1
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Fusion cores for 100 or under
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†3 star legendaries for 200 to 1000
---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Good explosive legendaries for 5000+
---
What's so good about bloodied?
---
Since vending started I‚Äôve made roughly 80k. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for me, your mileage may vary: 
---
1. Moved to a more central location, not far from vault 76. Easy/cheap fast travel for everyone. 
---
2. Entire CAMP, except one small separate building (where my terminal to open and close the shop is)  is open so nobody gets trapped and can access everything they need. 
---
3. Almost all Legendary weapons/armor are priced at 200/star for weapons, 150/star for armor. Really great weapon+effect combos might be 500 per star. Highly sought after/god roll type items can be much more, but are rare exceptions. Most of my sales are the low priced legendaries. 
---
4. Serums are my second best seller at 300 per. 
---
5. Plans, priced at about half of face value move very well. 
---
6. Rare clothing items, priced around 250-500 caps are efficient items as well. They don‚Äôt move as fast, but they also have very little weight. 
---
I‚Äôve opted for items that generally carry more value per item than things like ammo or chems/aid. However, I‚Äôve sold ammo before, at 1 cap per round and it did sell well, I just opted for more of a ‚ÄúLegendary Liquidation Sale‚Äù thing for my shop.  That may change over time, we‚Äôll see.
---
Why would you do that?
---
Just use your stash?
---
Well, TIL. Thanks!
---
I don't dwindle around Whitesprings because it's old.
---
I built mine around Arktos Pharma to help out and to make things easier for others.
---
You make some very good points but all the exaggeration is completely unnecessary.
---
&gt;500K with the build below
---
Would you have a link of your build?
---
What is a stimpak diffuser? I got the plan for it but what is it?
---
Thank you all for the reactions so far!
---
Some really usefull comments in here!
---
My very first drop was an Assassin's Exploding Gatling Gun (with +250 DR while reloading) I've been afraid to try for anything else ever since :-)
---
I‚Äôve done this myself before, and do every time I get the chance to.
---
I'm the same maybe 5 or 6 times I can count being disconnected pretty stable for me
---
I don't see your problem...Isn't "reflex sight" a way better description and you know exactly what you need to do for your badge now?
---
Bethesda pls...
---
That legendary should be harder to kill. I accidentally one-shot the legendary radscorpion thinking it was just another bug and didn‚Äôt check before hitting. I felt so bad for the other guys running the event. 
---
On the other hand I‚Äôve had people come steal my legendaries for Uranium Fever so many times that I know the feeling enough
---
500k? Lolol just 500 lemme logon and see if I can snap a couple of pics
---
That can't be! We've slain so many! Don't tell me we might have killed poor old Preston! ü§£
---
Nowhere near 201, but if its any consolation, I haven't finished it either.
---
I was told that they capped the DPH at 120, not sure how true that is though.
---
I‚Äôll match that price and lower mine as well. tbh it‚Äôs interesting watching how the games economy fluctuates in prices with all these items. I don‚Äôt sell any of my plans too expensive either tbh I have around 60 at my camp rn and I got them from events and sometimes if other vendors have really discounted plans I‚Äôll buy them and resell at my shop for a tiny bit more depending on rareness. One time I went to a high level dudes camp and he had every plan in two vending machine for sale for one cap so I took all of one and my buddy took the other. Im only level 65 but love selling so I drive competitive prices and go ‚Äúthrift shopping‚Äù where I can and find people‚Äôs good cheap items.
---
6 of the 16 comments on this post are from you saying the same thing.  Who's whining again?
---
I don‚Äôt mutate but I don‚Äôt do PVP, my friend is mutated though and the difference is absolutely ridiculous.
---
Its very useful against People in the Encrypted Event who dont act as Conduits and just run around.
---
I agree that the extra \* can sometimes entice a buyer. However, most of what I see in other vendors machines are either 2-3\* items that should be honestly turned to scrip (nocturnal limb damage anything) or a overpriced 2-3\* with a good primary effect but a bad secondary/tertiary. 
---
The other reality is that I have things I cant sell in my vending machine. These items are either still worth more than the 25k cap max or are worth enough caps that I would hit my cap max and not get the full value. This is why my shop focuses on lower value legendaries. This way I have time to adjust and move caps or make a purchase to free up cap space.
---
Not really. No camps are ever that outlandish or special. At least not on Xbox anyway, it‚Äôs nearly always just a big square box of varying sizes with work benches and vending machines. I‚Äôm happy to just find a camp that looks like you could live there. A little furniture, some posters or a radio. A few days ago I stumbled across the first camp to actually have a toilet and sink and was pretty impressed with their layout and decorations.
---
&gt; Bobbleheads  
---
How much I can ask for each ?
---
Haha, keep goin! I have gotten a few good ones before this one. One was a bloodied 25% fire rate laser Gatling, the other was an anti armor swing speed shovel.
---
lol sorry about the sarcasm. I know how real RNG works, but from my observation that‚Äôs not the case with FO servers. If it‚Äôs real RNG the odds to get identical items or prefixes in a row is very low, given the number of total possible combinations, yet this keeps happening. Sometimes ten nocturnal or stalker‚Äôs pieces in a row, sometimes identical items get dropped by two creatures consecutively, The odd is very very low if it‚Äôs real RNG. 
---
This led me to believe there are probably two layers of RNG with FO76. Each server gets assigned a pool of items by semi-RNG, then when the items are dropped there‚Äôs a second RNG. The second RNG chooses from the pool generated by the first RNG, so if the server didn‚Äôt get a good pool in the first RNG, you‚Äôre not likely to get a god roll from that server. 
---
I said semi-RNG because the total pool has to be created and distributed across all servers, so that all possible and logical combinations should have a chance and won‚Äôt have more chance than others.
---
More moddable legendary effects even if they're still on the level of Scorched killer and Sacrificial Blade. Throw Sheepsquatch imposter head in there too please. I actually messaged one of the community managers about that exact thing and said people would only use those weapons for show
---
Atleast you finished the event. I have played 3 times and never enough people doing it. I cant do it alone I'm only level 53. But I try to do my share in the killing and protecting. But I feel like the people I played with dont know what to do or what they're doing.
---
I have full tank killer and an AA lvl50 hunting rifle. they really only seem to help when I can also trigger the sneak bonus.
---
Make some nukashine and drink it... pretty cool unmarked locations.
---
Damn yeah 6 is doing it too. I'm looking into it.
---
i found this a little confusing at times, the part 1 and part 2. i think in google forms you can ask ppl to rank things like what was your most favorite part of wild appalachia instead of making it like you did in this
---
but great idea in making this
---
Was thinking this yesterday too. The Sheepsquatch Staff is probably my favorite looking weapon. I wanted to switch to it so bad after using All Rise for hundreds of hours. The stats can be good with my bloodied build, but no legendary effects kinda ruins it for me. I can get 1000 additional damage with my bloodied mole miner gauntlet
---
I wish they would bring back the mile long dogs though. Haven‚Äôt seen those in ages and it was always funny to watch.
---
I can't believe you've done this.
---
Thanks this is what I wanted to do, google took me here cause I can't foundation stack.
---
I‚Äôm all for realistic builds and this looks so awesome. I love nothing more in this game than camps built into existing structures.
---
Where did I exaggerated? These are unobtainable from regular methods, their supply is limited, their mod combination is bugged and ignores one of the weapon parameters replacing its value with infinity, and they made PvP too easy for people who have access to them. All these - facts.
---
sheepsquatch clubs have poisoned mod, which is very rare, But poison armor damage could be good only for SBQ fights, but she's immune to it
---
My sister has been watching it with me and every time she hears the clicking she tells me how she feels so bad but wants to laugh cause all she thinks of is fallout
---
I'd buy a pet if I could "repair" it when it died like the Brahmin.
---
You are a bad guy
---
Yeah but it doesn't give a star does it? I have all of the sheepsquanch mods and plans
---
This, 100% this.  Floors are great, keep adding those too, but seriously, not a single wall or roof skin since the launch of the game?
---
Gonna post some pics on my build in a new thread as I cant post pictures here
---
1000 isn't the hard limit. You could use the pocket bug and go over 5k with little to no issues, the problem is when multiple people were doing it, the server literally died.
---
Someone proposed the open 6ft radius solid (non-player made) ground only idea for the ft mats. Not a bad idea and can be implimented.
---
You need a proper server for what your asking for.
---
Having killed many queens, this is coming from experience. Not every server can kill a queen. Not every server will have the right willing and able players to max this event. 
---
That doesn't mean you need to blow 30 minutes of your life hoping it happens.
---
Heres some advice. Go to Looking for Group if on xbox and post that your getting a party together for the event OR look for groups already running the event. Don't just hope and pray it will work perfect every time. Thats how you spend your night disappointed.
---
Get a mule, and put those pieces on it.  That way, they exist someplace still.. but you don't have them clogging up your stash.  :)
---
No blame.. I mean if they sold extra stash space for atoms.
---
I don't have a lot of junk in my 4 machines. But ammo wise, 5.56 and 5mm sell quicker than I can make them. I am selling them at 1c each though. But as I don't use 5.56, and have over 30k of 5mm it's basically all free caps to me. So I'm fine with that.
---
Sounds like it was a successful nuke.
---
awesome thanks dudes
---
TIL they can be upgraded, how?
---
if we're talking not about rare effects and about stars yes, it doesn't give any star to your weapon
---
I'd be happy with just a modified wood or brick wall plan that lets you slap some paint on them, that and a plan for different paints that could use stuff like adhesive,lead and flowers/monster parts to make
---
Some players don't realize this. I know it seems obvious but when the default price for an item is 60c you may not realize it won't sell for more than 20c. You also may not realize how valuable say a Hunters Long coat is when the default price is 100-500c. IDK What the default sell price is I've never been able to find one so that's just an example.
---
Sooner or later the player vending prices will stabalize and most players will know at what price items will sell. Until then posts like this one will be helpful in creating regularity in the market.
---
I also realize that players will eventually learn that 1‚òÜ Ghoul Slayers assault rifle will never sell for 500c-1000c it's only worth 5 scrip but these type of posts should speed up the process.
---
More than agree!
---
Telling them to not listen to the community but listen to you. That‚Äôs not biased at all.
---
Bravo Zulu on the recruiting pitch...I'm in.
---
Yeah a small balcony in the first floor to see people and to shoot critters etc coming would be cool you could maybe extend walls outward and make a canopy
---
BS. You guys have digital keyboards that can pop up for this.
---
Keeping a feature from PC because it won't work on consoles is bad business.
---
I was on top of whitespringns resort and I saw one of the big killers down in a courtyard. I shot at them with sole survivor and she was on me in an instant with one of those sparkle rifles. I couldn't believe she one hit me from that distance that quickly.
---
This info explains the damage but I'm still skeptical about her aim. Not as fast as known cheaters but much much faster then 90% of my fire fights. Are people that good at PvP FPS spending all their time in fallout? 
---
I need to keep practicing.
---
I never said that, I'm definitely for a stash size increase and a camp budget increase as well, I'm just acknowledging that there are some technical challenges to this change, but I can't really say to what extent.
---
I think the easiest perk that could be applied to the stash is weight reduction to weapons and armor, these wouldn't have many extra data columns and currently have the most weight to database usage ratio, while food items with varying and changing condition levels over time would be much worse.
---
Junk items are all exactly the same for 1 type, so these are easy to just have a count value to track them, so 1 steel is the same as 50k steel as far as the database is concerned. The issue should only be for distinct items in the stash.
---

Any advice? Every time I have played we can keep 1 alive feels like 3 would be impossible.
---
It is my mission to stamp out idiocy wherever it manifests.
---
in this tale... as it played out... I think without F-bombs it would be fake... lol I had my first base near the SuperD mart... was peaceful for weeks... then one day a 'random' 50 plus level SM comes knocking on my door... Just after I hit level 50... then came the real fun neighbors... every f'n type of SB and Mirelure each and every-time I would go to my camp... needless to say... in a few days... I put the place up for rent...
---
The problem with that is people using it to spawn players in death zones. Imagine a player using the vending to lure people to a death maze in survival. There‚Äôs a deathclaw inside and it‚Äôs surrounded by turrets and Tesla traps
---
Nope. Literally just failed another one because everyone else was fighting the alpha while the last animal got murdered.

Wish the dataminers would find and publish the gospel of RNGesus...  we are all just lost and guessing

Metal walls are at the whitespring station vendor. Pricey but worth it imho.
---
Catering to the few and not the many isn't a great way to sell games.

---
I accidentally did this to some random guy i was trying to revive i felt very bad but hey at least my character wasnt starving any more
---
-shrug- that kinda screws luck unfortunately
---
I would really like this option too. Last night another player came to my camp. I wanted to buy loose screws from him and he wanted some stuff from me. He gave me the loose screws for nothing but for some reason he wasn‚Äôt taking what he asked for. Then my game crashed and I couldn‚Äôt remember his GT. thank you and sorry, mysterious stranger
---
Unfortunately there's not a lot you can do alone. Yes you can keep 1 creature alive, but if other players are oblivious to what's going on then you're fucked.
---
Literally did Project Paradise, completed it, logged off, came back and shit was gone
---
Thanks for the feedback man, first time for me so I appreciate it.

I decided to cut those parts out and simply make it single answer, which should keep the data less clustered and avoid confusing any more people.
---
There's a little lake east of Top of the World train station, some brahmin live there. I've noticed at least three permanent stores plus myself set up around the lake. It's nice and central, not many mobs and Mothman keeps lookout for us at night.
---
Unable to post pics, but I have definite numbers for you now that I'm logged on. S 15 (mostly same perks) P 3, E 13 (radicool is here, not C) 9C (mainly to share skills, but I've included strange in numbers) 6I, 5A, 5L (class freak).. currently at 36/336 hp doing 495 per hit with bloodied death tambo.
---
fixed it
---
I heard rumors about noclip cheat that allows you to mark all players on your map somehow. I don't know the details, but there was one extremely active PvP player that I heard reports of getting into walls and thats commonly despised for amazing PvP performance and they disappeared recently, perhaps banned.
---
But ye the problem with these lasers is not their damage, its that they ignore their range parameter.
---
I myself am Titanfall 1 and 2 PC veteran and I'm deeply in love with F76.
---
I am level 250+ and roll with 4-5 other guys same level that all do bloodied build and thousands of damage per hit. To complete this event at 100% it takes us all to coordinate which biomes we are working on, thats all i‚Äôm trying to say. You can protect one biome pretty much solo but to do all 3 and get it 100% takes more than 2 people in the event. You can complete the event with just 1 biome but you don‚Äôt get the top tier rewards out of the event. I am just trying to teach some etiquette which has apparently been lost on the younger generation, as has working with others to achieve a common goal.
---
Dph?
---
it was a bit broken but I fixed it now, should be open
---
Haha. That‚Äôs awesome.
---
It fails but you still get the loot off the ‚Äòsquatch and other legendary foes in the basement.
---
I‚Äôm yet to get anything half decent from completing the event. Best I got was an Arktos lab coat and a bear arm; both of which are pretty meh.
---
Yeah, I've said before that since shared loot is a thing among teammates in close vicinity of each other, regardless if they get a hit in or not, that it should become a thing in events since we all become temporary teammates anyway.
---
I shoot them all, him and those two that are arguing all the time in the middle of no where....
---
I didn't say to not listen to the community, and I didn't say to listen to me. I suggested that they listen to everyone very cautiously, you and me alike. This game is completely unique; and has laid the framework to be a masterpiece. Right now it sits in three genres, survival, mmo, and  loot shooter. The most popular games in these genres have been completely destroyed because the community is never happy, and is always asking and demanding changes that ease their game-play but ruin the structure of the game itself (the exception being Rust, because Rust keeps the mindset of get good and adapt to the game, rather than it adapting to you).
---
I think what‚Äôs happened is the griefer types have gotten their asses kicked in survival so they come back to adventure and act like knuckleheads. 
---
The other thing I‚Äôm noticing is people getting aggressive and pissy about trades or buying things at their camp.  I was at WS station cashing in some legendaries and some guy that had his camp next to the train station starts swiping at me with his deathclaw to get my attention.  Well, I got his attention and blasted him.  I checked out his camp anyway and it was overpriced garbage.   
---
Just like a dude that wanted to buy my AAE combat shotgun and Prime Gauss rifle.  I mean, cmon already.  I decline and he tries to gank.  So he also ate a lead sandwich.

Most of the time I just want to be left alone.  Why people feel the need to aggravate or instigate I don‚Äôt understands. Can‚Äôt blow up camps anymore so how can I act like a jerkoff in other ways?

The most infuriating thing are the ghouls that slide on the ground &amp; invisible enemies. Bugs of this magnitude should not exist in a game that people have paid for.
---
I agree, I've seen several campfire events lost because no one else is keeping the fire going, and it seems the fire goes out faster the more people there are too.
---
Become harder to detect while sneaking is much more effective than Chameleon though:)
---
Ty sir/ma'am.. lol cant assume anything these days
---
Same as my TSE pump! Does next to no damage on my character, but cripples the limbs and has a nice spray effect.
---
Managed to cripple the Alpha in Project Paradise which made taking it down a lot easier.
---
I play on both Xbox and PS4 (The PS4 is mine, the Xbox is my partners) and my character on PS4 is only like level 33. My like 3 friends on PS4 who I play with on a norm are all much higher level. While they know I can't take down a boss on my own, I help as much as I can. They make sure I tag something so I get credit. If they are in a different area and run into something they have me fast travel and help.
---
i know how to resolve this for you... #1 do not fast travel to the pharma plant. fast travel to the place just east of it.  if you load into the game outside the plant do the same thing its 1 cap. #2 walk to the plant. #3 enter the elevator. once i learned how to do this i can enter no problem. now i still get crashes during the rewards part of the event. so dont click the boss till after you get the event rewards.
---
Nope. . . At least not for me. https://imgur.com/SL644ba
---
Any pics?
---
I'm so tired of people telling me how I can play in events...I'll look out for other players but to expect me to change my play style to suit you is absurd. Especially when I watch event requirements go unfulfilled because everyone wants to tag everything.
---
I hate when folks refuse to group up for that or just steal every kill. You wont lose anything being a team player, but you cant change folks minds these days lol
---
They can already give loot and legendarys for event completion. Just have to loot come through there rather than looting for boss kills.
---
Oh I see, as in like, they don't need to make any more $ from this title.
---
While I don't agree with single player offline AAA games getting non-cosmetic microtransactions, this is a games as a service title, continuously being worked on, so I don't mind tossing the company a few bucks after initial purchase providing the micro-transactions aren't overly predatory.
---
I'd pay $10 for double the stash space, for example, because I like to hoard.  It's not necessary; 800 is enough but I enjoy looting/scavenging in this game, it's about all I do really.
---
I'm curious to see what they do when the other vaults on the map open.
---
The price for those items from vendors is higher. They are getting a bargain even at starting price.
---
It's camps like this that make me completely wonder why my budget seems so small. That's crazy!
---
My neighbor, he is pain in my assholes. I get rug made from deathclaw, he get rug made from a deathclaw. I get clean blue door, he get a clean blue door. I get war rider paint, he cannot afford. Great success.
---
Fisto then
---
Fifties/Sixties era dosimeters did not click.   Geiger counters did.
---
I haven‚Äôt failed to kill a queen in months and last sunday a group i‚Äôm in did 9 queens in a day. I‚Äôve literally killed her with just 2 other people. This new event takes about 6 people to do it properly, all i‚Äôm trying to say is hey, if you see just 1 or 2 people down there, and theres a bunch of time left, just wait a few minutes and don‚Äôt just run up to the computer asap.
---
yeah dude...Why don't you just "long pipe-gun"? It's not that hard!
---
I find "stabilized barrel" way more helpful than an actual objective during Project Paradise...and people are confused why other people don't know what to do during the event
---
Ok
---
I always offer to team up but they decline I kill everything
---
Count yourself lucky. I see most people inflate the price rather than default it, well this is often the case for legendary items
---
Thank you! Finally someone said it!!!
---
I was one of those. after the broken release, I swore i'd never play it again. then I came across this forum and gave it a second chance last night. I freaken love it! Except I have no one to play with :-(
---
When you‚Äôre too far from any stashbox and you come across a short timed event.
---
A brief PSA for you Uranium Fever does not drop max level legendaries Mole Minors do not spawn over level 40. I personally only do uranium fever to stock up on Black Titanium, steel and scrip.
---
And yes etiquette dictates if there are other players in an event you shouldn't one-shot Legendaries. Not everyone follows this etiquette... not much we can do right now about it. Shared loot for events would be an amicable solution.
---
uh... my solution works for both though... Also I'm on PC not console. Alienating more than half of your userbase is bad business.
---
I'm nomadic in game and have several locations where I re use and build in the pre existing structures. It's almost impossible to fit benches or furniture into them now. I can anchor down a footlocker, cooker and banjo but everything else teleports onto the roof, or won't place at all lol.
---
yeah those toilets are really gross, and the seat doesnt even fit on them! who is gonna sit on that?
---
If your camp is near whitesprings it WILL get lots of traffic. I even saw one camp that was just a stash box, a generator and a vending machine. If your on the east part of the map at least try to get close to Berkeley.
---
You didn't have to delete your old photos, mine have been full for a minute now but I still get credit for getting pics of things.
---
The legendaries in Uranium Fever take at least some effort so people who ks them are the real dutchbags. In events like Campfire Tales or Leader of the Pack you have to actively try to not one shot.
---
Where can i find some mutations?
---
What does the diffuser actually do anyway?
---
You sure it wasn't the West Virginia paint?
---
Move along
---
see I try to team up with anyone that's not in a group and they just decline immediately or ignore it then like rush to the supervisors and they're dead before I cant even get to em. This is on my lvl 46. On my 138 I'll use one of my shittier weapons get them to mutate, and let everyone else take em out.
---
Who cares about finishing the event? Getting the legendary loot is the only worthwhile objective.
---
That said, these quests seem not well thought out and the instructions are unclear, so I can't blame people for not successfully finishing it assuming they're trying.
---
Still, even with my low prices it is rarely someone who buys. Gave away a batch of plans a while back though, and they went kind of fast.
---
Unfortunately I've only ever gotten an alert when she's killed, not when she spawns.
---
Clean stove and pan. 10/10 i'd eat from there.
---
Private servers won't come for a loooong time because Bethesda knows as soon as dedicated server files come out the modders will take over development from that point and nobody would have to buy Atomshop stuff anymore or wait for Bethesda's mercy for a bugfix.
---
just like with every other Fallout/Elder Scrolls before, Bethesda breaks it,mods fix it.
---
say this in jim sterlings voice: "Triple A Gaming"
---
That was the reason? Aha.
---
Wasn't it the case, that all other builds and perks were highly behind evrything with TSE? No?
---
And I still taste the tears from the pve kids and old men when you killed all their 20 ghouls with a single shot.
---
But I guess you are right, it needs to be the pvp losers fault. 
---
Maybe you should go back to singleplayer games when you can't handle and understand the reason of nerfs and fixes.
---
Level 80 is low level?
---
Get a grip mate. If you feel cheated in fantasy land, what are you like on real life. Do you hate everyone who has something you don't? Lolz
---
what about now?
---
Thanks man.  I'll be on this evening after work, I may add you.
---
&gt; Passive perks (lock-picking, hacking, bartering, solo, and team play) 
---
That is the only one I disagree with only because of how the game is set up.  If I don't want to waste fifty 5.56 rounds to kill a single level 50 super mutant I have to run with 12 perception with 9 star rifle men perk and 3 star even when using a level 50 maxed out hand made rifle.  So constantly having to shift between one rifleman perk and pulling out lock picking is just a pointless hassle. 
---
I don't mind it for repairs and crafting because that is often once every 4 or 5 hours while the lock picking is a lot more often. And lock picking doesn't have any direct effect because the loot is still randomized.  Even hacking level 3 computers and picking level 3 locks still not found any death claw hide.
---
Its still in beta at the moment just FYI so a lot is substitute to change on it
---
This sub is full of hypocrites. Use a base glitch? Cheater! Use a mode exploit? Perfectly fine!
---
Working. . .
---
Plus, as of like last year Xbox One can accept wired and wireless keyboards.
---
I'm not too sure about PS4.
---
With me it‚Äôs always been from queens though.
---
If you think things in games get nerfed because of "whining", you're an idiot. :)
---
Mark my words. We will get this alongside the first vault raid opening.
---
You can build your castle on sand or stone; they have to choose which market they'd like appeal to. I'm just simply saying that a majority of the complaints I've seen in this reddit seem to come from Fallout fans who want the game to cater more towards their single player aspects in other Fallout titles; offering suggestions that would ruin exactly what this game was created to be. The other half are the players that finally have a game of their favorite genre set in the Fallout world (survival, mmo, loot shooter, etc), where they can play with friends and fight other players.   
---
This is the first multiplayer Fallout installment and if you're asking for Bethesda to cater to your desires to make it less survival, less mmo, less loot shooter, and/or less multiplayer, then you should just go back to Fallout 4 or wait for the next single player installment and ask them to add a co-op mode. Can't ask for QOL updates that completely destroy what this game is.
---
Not me.  If it‚Äôs a one star I probably won‚Äôt sell it.  However, a sweet non legendary like a lvl 50 LMG I may sell.  I did this other day in fact.  I got it off a glowing deathclaw at WS.  It was valued at almost 400 caps.  Put it up for 100. 
---
Part of my challenge is I have several decent 3 star weapons and decent armor as well.  So when I see a 1 star furious Tesla for sale for 2K caps honestly that‚Äôs ridiculous.  
---
No different than people selling standard ammo for more than 1 cap apiece.  You should not be pricing 44 or 38 or even 45 or 308 for more than 1 cap.  MAYBE 2 caps for 556 or 50 cal but cmon now. 
---
It‚Äôs my same feeling as those that lock down your water.  I mean it‚Äôs water.  You can‚Äôt possibly consume all of it.  There seems to be a direct correlation between those that lock their purifiers and those that overprice their stuff.  It‚Äôs a free country but ‚Äúprice to sell‚Äù is always the best strategy.
---
Of course.
---
Not only that.....I wouldn't be holding 2 pylons if I had loot for you to steal..... LOL.
---
They did kinda fix the Gatling sight I thought...
---
After the last update they would never be able to recreate them lol.
---
Mines on a hill right slap bang over the Philippi Battle Cemetery, but because of it's the location ( I love the view) all my items are reduced :) Sometimes even shove some free aid items for weary travellers in too.
---
Actually it is and the logic sounds a bit like a paradox.  You water it down to much and it becomes a mess for both fans of specific field and non fans who look at it and just say "wow what a fucking mess"
---
You can get legendaries anywhere. Personally I'm after the backpack and diffuser recipe which you can only get, by chance, if you complete the event.
---
cool thanks for letting me know
---
Did the 1 cap issue get fixed?  When vending first came out I didn't get any caps when something sold for 1 cap.  I had some buy 1k 10mm and I didn't get any caps. It was something to do with the tax thing.  Since then my min price on anything is 2 caps.
---
You have to stay close to the alpha and keep attacking it so it aggroes to you and not the animal. The sheepsquatch at least doesn't hit that hard, but the fog crawler or grafton monster will demolish it
---
Np. Completed it, thanks for fixing it and doing it in the first place.
---
Key rings, yes. Yes. They also need to get rid of all duplicates and also add in the "you already have this" type thing when trying to pick up another key or other non-droppable item and wont let you take it. This might help with stability possibly from not having all those duplicate items people cant get rid of perhaps.
---
Take action shots. I took a few photos of rare dead stuff but the live action shots are perfect loading screens.
---
You can
---
I only keep the ones that look good in loading screens.. everything else gets deleted ASAP
---
Agreed. It shouldn't have to be part of our play strategy to have to clip a boss in order to get reward. How is it fun to say "dont kill that legendary let me shoot it first!" Then you're scrambling through mobs sucking down stims.  Not good. 
---
And sometimes you're off soloing a wave of 6 mobs while boss gets melted behind you. Why should anyone be punished for that?  It's a bad xp reward set up for sure. Should have proximity xp and loot allowed, team or no. This has caused way too much frustration for me and friends. 
---
And my build is rifle so incan one hit vats ghouls and other mobs in the head.  I have to handicap myself when in a group so they can get xp. Not cool, bro. Let me be me and let us share rewards!
---
I sell a lot of Treated Marine Wetsuits &amp; Protected BOS Suits.  I sell them cheap as it costs me next to nothing to make them.  I also sell a lot of plans.  Any plans that I get and already know, I sell, and lower than the valued price.  I price things to sell because to me it's all extra caps as I've gotten the stuff for free.  I don't get a ton of traffic, so I'm not raking in caps, probably because my camp is across from Top of The World on a mountain, but atleast when people show up, they usually buy a couple of things.  I do have quite a few unyielding pieces and a sentinel piece to get rid of but not sure what to price them at, so I'll have to do a price check on here so I can get rid of those.  I can't see just scriping those.  When I go to camps, I'm going for plans that I don't have.  And I will usually buy something from each camp I go to, even if there's nothing I want, I'll buy something cheap just to show support.
---
I thought the new raider hair was all new? I do know there were two datamines recently for brand new hair.
---
Listen, I play a good guy in the game so I fell you... but this is a role play game, and this is a world where most people go raider lore-wise; all I‚Äôm saying. This isn‚Äôt an acute natural disaster, it‚Äôs the end of the world in this game. Who knows how the majority of people would act?
---
Whining about TSE shotguns in PVP = nerf.  Whining about sentinel and cavalier armor in PVP = nerf.   Pretty clear pattern.
---
Yeah I know said player. I've run into him and he shot me through a wall at whitespringns. His steam account indicates he is banned from multiple games. He posts on Aimbots forum and wallhax. I may have gone a bit overboard looking into him but I was curious how it works. These cheaters pay per day to use the cheat software.
---
It's advertised as a way of decimating servers full of noobs. Fucking silly shit.
---
The idea of drawing his fire must be what these guys are doing to him cause I've seen him get killed a few times. But only by the guys at the top of the kill boards.
---
I also believe he is back under a new name. And not being as obvious as he used to be.
---
Just another chem I won't make lol
---
There are always these asshats that dont care that there are others there. I really like the ones that show up with 2 minutes left and do that....
---
Cheers for the answers.
---
Have been itching to do this tbh, care a lot about this game and want to see it succeed, plus I am a massive Bethesda fanboy hahah
---
Good advice BlackRL
---
Standard chems for 10-15,  mods for 25, bobble heads for no more than 100 (I‚Äôve priced at 50-75).  I‚Äôve also priced fusion cores below 100 but that‚Äôs because they weren‚Äôt 100%.
---
I was the same way. I just got back into it last night and its amazing. People work together more than they did at the beginning. I was even saved twice by some high level characters 2x last night. Its super fun.
---
If you have plenty of caps you can often buy 2 at a time at the Enclave. Sometimes the inventory there is modded up and quite expensive but other times not and you can buy for around 400 caps a piece as I recall. I bought quite a few there as a shortcut to crafting/scrapping. 
---
If you just want the one you have modded up, look on the trading subs as there are players who will do mods for you. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I will help you out. 
---
But if you‚Äôre on a mission to learn all the mods yourself just hang in there. It‚Äôs a grind for sure.
---
Has been same for me I did finally get 4 of them but that was one turned in daily(often several times) for 2 months straight.  It's an extremely low chance drop, good luck.  It does seem impossible though I hear you, oh how I hear you.  I wish there was a tracker to how many times I've actually turned it in, gotta be close to a hundred if not more.
---
assuming you're on PC as well, and not linux and wine, which version of windows and are you running any P2P clients?
---
My RNG for the paints has been crap as well, turned in 30 so far, no paints yetüòê
---
Yes that has been happening to me since launch. I doubt they will ever patch it. It's cost me a lot of junk too. Especially annoying when it costs me a legendary!
---
I set my plans really low, if the dont sell i just dumped them in the overseers box in flatwoods
---
Likewise. Despite all of the early (and current) negative push from others.
---
You can craft a lot of ammo quickly with super duper 3.  And charging 2 caps per round is excessive unless it‚Äôs 556 or 50 cal.  Even shotgun shells can and should go for 1 apiece.
---
This is the smartest comment I've ever read on this subreddit.
---
I know there is already some salt but MakeNoMistakes is right.  People *think* that their suggestions will make the game fun by making certain elements easier or less frustrating.  But just because you *play* a lot of games doesn't mean you know anything about *designing* games. 
---
Do you know why Monopoly is such a long boring game?  While there are lots of issues about game design from the 1920's, the average session should last no more than an hour.  People *think* if they put in their own rules or interpretations of rules it will make the game more fair or fun.  (No property auctions when a player declines to purchase a property, preventing housing shortages, putting fees under free parking to collect when a player lands there.)
---
It doesn't make Monopoly fun, it ruins it.  Yes I know the perk cards are frustrating but the system does let you adapt to various situations and balance changes, in exchange for inconvenience.  Frustration and inconvenience are an integral part of game design:  remember trying to find the 3rd rock past the tree to the east of Balmora to continue a quest in Morrowind?  That wasn't fun, till you found it and got the emotional payoff.
---
I even like the idea of passive perks, but many would hate my implementation of it.  I'd put you through a ringer for rank 3 lockpick or armorer.
---
I like shops like this because I come in, use the facillities, and if something ok is decently priced I'll buy it on part as a thanks.
---
Yes.  Could not respawn at my camp or Vault 76 last night but thankfully could respawn at teammate‚Äôs camp.
---
That player can still get loot showing up 2 secs before it dies if they get a hit in..
---
Great question... Ive seen them for 100 but dont pay much attention because I dont use them
---
I read that some people were modifying legendaries and losing legendary effects.
---
Exactly, also, no one gives more than 1 for most ammo.
---
Yeah, needs a fix.
---
Link shared a vid, lemme know if you can watch it or not, but I tried lol, cheers!.. I'm on xbox btw, crazyelf420
---
It's not a lingering alert I've noticed. Just a quick pop up and then gone it seems, immediately after the nuke event goes away, "Death From Above".
---
I put all my unwanted ammo for 0. Better than the old paper bag method
---
You cant turn in more than 1 data at a time, if you collect more it just treats it as 1. If you had data stashed then maybe try taking them out one at a time, putting them in a random container then pick up again to trigger it - dont know if that works, it used to. 
---
But it is pretty random when you get the paint. Took me ages to get initiate, then ages to get knight. Seemed forever to get knight captain. 
---
Just keep at it. One of these times you will get the paints.
---
"Buildin' a sentry!"
---
I never realized how badly I wanted to play as the Engineer in FO76 and provide support during events, until just now.
---
The D became J or I'm seeing only part of the picture and hackusating J? No names used here as I don't want to witchhunt. I assume we're both PC.
---
Huh, TIL. I stand corrected, I didn‚Äôt know there were decent rewards cause I hadn‚Äôt seen any pop up on the marketplace subreddits.
---
Are you wearing weight reducing armour? Like 20% lighter weapons / junk / whatever.
---
When you wear power armour you lose the benefit of that weight reduction. That's probably what's happening.
---
There's a few places close enough to whitesprings that aren't whitesprings that you can build on. I'm way up on the cliffs and still get decent traffic Because it's only 2c to fast travel there.
---
I haven‚Äôt received any in three months.  I used to find Initiate with some regularity.   I suspect something got glitched.  Note that you cannot get higher level without Initiate‚Äîand it no longer drops.
---
Usually has to do if you're encumbered. They have "fixed" it many times.
---
Unpopular opinion - build elevated shops.  I'm sick of spawning inside your walls.  Usually running like mad helps, but sometimes it takes 3 load screens to get there.  I don't bother with out of the way shops much anymore, even if they have 20 weapons, 20 armor, 100 plans and 20 mods...
---
A lot of bobble heads I see for sale are in the 75-100 range.  I‚Äôve priced them below that but some are better than others.  Explosive is a good one to have.
---
(Before my PC cousins reply, I‚Äôm on Xbox and cannot mod)
---
Please explain. I haven't found a way
---
This just happened to me at Campfire, I was hearing up to tag the wendigo, we were all lower level (below 80 at least) and a 130+ comes from no where and one shots it. Annoying as shit!
---
You don't have to constantly switch. Run your combat perks until you final a terminal or a lock to pick, clear the area, change the card (or ideally loadout), take care of business, and then switch back.
---
This sub is full of babies lol
---
Actually I get griefed maybe every other week.  Most people are not raiders in my experience.
---
Good and nice idea.
---
I need mods for my handmade but come across them so seldomly that I can't bring myself to scrap them! Guess I'll start!!! Oh and my lever action.. absolutely no mods for it yet. And all I can find at vendors is the NV scope.
---
I mean, what am I supposed to do about it?  I got it as a legitimate gift, was perplexed that I somehow "knew" it despite never clicking on it, and that's just how it is.  Now I can craft HC Backpacks.  I can't cover for every unintended exploit Bethesda leaves in the game.  Given how broken some of the Pioneer Scouts things are, and continue to be, I'm willing to call it even. üòã
---
While I do play Survival mode, I don't really do much PvP, unless in self-defence.
---
To answer your questions:
---
Do I find it fun? Not really. I prefer to think as well as fight.
---
Did I build my Character to do it? No, but it still happens on Humanoid enemies (Headshots).
---
Do I agree with it? Can't really answer that one.
---
Fact is, it IS meta. OHKO's are almost always meta.
---
But it's also devoid of skill or actual ability.
---
VATS is Auto-Aim, Concentrated Fire is Easy Mode for Headshots.
---
It's like a Jet racing a snail, no competition at all, in PVE, and PVP turns it into Sudden Death, with no lead up.
---
Dont know if this will be of any help, but what I did was picked one location and kept hopping till I found it. 
---
I chose Colonel Kelly monument and I found this location to be very consistent. 1st attempt at getting camera only took about 6 or 7 hops. 
---
Needed to look for it again to help my husband find his, same story. And a third time I did this I found it within 2 hops. 
---
It'll likely be the same for any location though.
---
Yeah, I do nearly all plans for 50 caps a pop.  People can grab stuff that they haven't learned yet, I get a little bit of caps to cover my fast traveling - everyone wins.
---
Or even just allow them to be a Purveyor drop when you have learnt the plan / picked it up
---
I have a boat build and fast travel always spawns me in the water.  I'm constantly getting parasites when I go home.
---
Sharing is good and would be nice if more people cared - but Campfire Tales and the Ever Upwards quest line is more mid level than low level.  There's a real risk both at the cleanup waste at Kidde Corner Cabins since a lv 50 Mirelurk Queen often spawns right on top of some of the goo spots you have to clean up and there's always yao guai at Dolly Sod's.
---
I managed a backpack on my lv 40-ish character but that wasn't easy by any means - killed by a yao guai the first time I tried to get to Dolly Sods, etc.  Had to take down the Mirelurk Queen the other night just to do the cleanup again.  And this character has 2-3\* level appropriate legendary weapons as well.
---
With Campfire Tales, event completion has to be considered as well - take too long and letting the fire die down just fails the event for everyone.
---
Ok, thanks
---
I cleaned house of my legendaries...and now regret letting go of all rise, I'm not fond of melee but it does come in handy sometimes and now it's gone. I bought a fancy modded sheepsquatch staff that I thought would be a good replacement...but nope it was weak.
---
Give me liberty uh I mean walls or give me death!!
---
The loot table in the game is abysmal‚Äîmaking the trade subReddits a necessity.
---
Haha, thanks. No one has ever commented on the flag reference before! Double kudos :)
---
Yeah I don't really want human NPCs.  Maybe if they were in another zone - but I like that Appalachia is filled with monsters and mutated residents.  I do think it would be cool if the mutated decedents of our Residents appeared in the next fallout game though.
---
I have to admit it's very rare, but I can kill a regular scorchbeast with about 10 shots of my handmade so I actively hunt them down.
---
lol My obscenities at Sunday dinner...awesome! lol
---
What platform are you on?
---
Xbox One
---
No worries. My current character is level 25. I have a level 97 but the tadpoles quest bugged on me so I started again..
---
Thiswhy we, PC gamers are the master race...
---
My bad mate, I meant DPS
---
&gt; That legendary should be harder to kill. I accidentally one-shot the legendary
---
I did the same thing at that event.  Oops.  Didn't realize it was made of glass.
---
This has has happened to many it seems. Myself as well sometimes. My theory is a connection to being over encumbered. When you die you momentarily lose weight reducing perks from armor and weapons. If that put you over the limit, they only let you spawn at 76. Presumably to keep players from cheesing their way back to camp when over encumbered. 
---
I think its a bug when you zero options to spawn.
---
So just have it be a hassle for the sake of being a hassle? Im neutral on this as I don't particularly mind switching back and forth. However, there are people who like to pick every lock they come across and they /do/ have to constantly switch back and forth depending on their build.
---
This thread does not help that at all though. There is no ‚Äúlist‚Äù of the rare things like the hunters coat. This thread is nothing more than vague obvious statements. If is said ‚Äúhere is a list of the rare outfits and variants in the game along with the respective values per system‚Äù then that is useful. Saying ‚Äúrarer items sell for more‚Äù is useless.
---
Any suggestions for putting prices for treasure maps?
---
That is fair. We failed the event first time we tried then barely won the second. But when you get people who just stand on top of the feeder doing nothing, or abandon their creature the first chance they get... that annoys me.
---
Sometimes there's nothing you can do to protect your animals. I had kept a tick on full health through the entire thing. The Alpha Sheepsquatch then spawned in and one shot it. There was nothing I could do. Nothing anyone could do.
---
Absolutely not. The popular opinion of this reddit is that Bethesda needs to cater to the player base that wants to make this game more like their single player experience past Fallout installments. The other popular opinion that is overshadowed by the one mentioned above is that this is finally the Fallout experience we have been waiting for; those of us that find very limited enjoyment in the single player games because of the lack of challenge in them. The difference is: historically changing multiplayer games to cater to single player experiences, or to streamline it (making it easier, and more casual) has killed nearly every game that has ever done this. My ONLY (I and want) opinion is that the game is not challenging enough, and I wish it was more grueling like Rust (at least the survival mode).
---
IDK but you need to use it 3 times for the medic badge.
---
There will always be an OP combo, change one thing and the Meta Shifts to another combo, nearly every PvE primary game that allows PVP has suffered from the same problem.   
---
   
---
In short, "Nerfing" the Legacy Explosive energy weapons won't fix the problem, and will make the sole viable use of them ineffective in PvE. (let's be honest, even with the Buffs all energy weapons are seriously under powered compared to Ballistics).    
---
Add in the fact Bethesda doesn't fully grasp the in game balance and combos (the nerfs, rebalances etc reflect that) and you are asking for more trouble then you realize, because the response will likely be to Nerf Energy weapons, which are **substantial under powered** still, Legacy explosive aside.
---
     
---
Rather than focusing on "X is broke" try and find not only a counter, but other effective combos that give you an advantage.  
---
PVP &amp; PvE in a game like this, and most other non-standard games is about finding unusual combos that work well together.  
---
**TL:DR**  
---
Asking Bethesda to Nerf things is bad, because they don't fully get the in game balance (no offense to anyone) and the solution should not be asking someone to fix "X" but finding an effective combo of your own and/or a counter.
---
&gt;**Turning all 1\* items into scrip. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.** There are some really really good 1\* weapon / effect combos that people want. Most of my legendary sales are in 1\* items of popular weapons with popular effects. Players between lvls 50-100 are looking to find max lvl items that fit their build / play style and a lot of times they don't want to spend all of their caps on a 2\* or 3\* item. A 1\* with the right effect is what I call a starter build item. It gets you 75% of the way there but only costs you 10-20% of the caps.
---
100% This.
---
Yep.  I see many camp vendors totally overpricing their stuff.  I run 23-25K caps constantly and have no need for 3 star weapons or armor as a lvl 191 I already have most of what I want and need. However, I‚Äôd rather buy than farm some items (such as ammo) so if you price it right I‚Äôll buy it.  Did it this morning.  Bought 800 shotgun shells because the person had it priced to sell at 1 cap each.
---
ye boi
---
yeah if you time it good enough you can collect "attacks" of various mobs 
---
Saw somebody collected the mirelurk queen's "acid spit attack" and a scorchbeast "screech beam attack" a few months ago
---
The Blade of Bastet and Voice of Set, as far as I know, are the only unique weapons in the game that can be upgraded to level 50 no matter the level you received it at. And a weapons bench you can upgrade it's level as long as you actually have one in your inventory as the weapon itself is a crafting ingredient (if you sold it or tossed it, you are out of luck unless you can find someone willing to give/sell you theirs). It can not be upgraded in the sense of adding mods.
---
&gt; And anyone 18+ who doesn‚Äôt understand the basics of ‚Äúshopping‚Äù should probably do the same.
---
Okay, you can go re-evaluate yourself now. I saw in another post where you said you have been going from player vending machine to player vending machine looking for the Signs and Letters plan because you don't have enough caps to buy it regularly and it doesn't spawn in world.  Someone who has the plan also paid 8k+ caps for it.  Do you really think they're going to take a 5,000 cap loss and put it in their vending machine for 4,000 caps?
---
Effective change often starts from within oneself
---
I'll keep a closer eye out.
---
Do you even *need* to sort keys? It's not like you have to manually use them from the inventory.
---
Nothing "innocent" about a loaded question based on a false premise intended to trigger a reaction. That's pretty much textbook trolling, and you pretending to not understand that makes you an asshole.
---
You, sir, just got an upvote from my wife :D
---
Yeah. I enjoyed the badge grind, got to 7 badges, and then bought the high capacity mod via player vending for 1,500 caps instead. Even without exploiting the bug, it felt cheap. If not for the bug, there‚Äôs no way that item would have been in vending. Still there‚Äôs no way Bethesda could un-ring that bell.
---
I'm legit curious, how does ammo at 1 not make a profit if you're just finding it in the wasteland?
---
FML :(
---
Thanks for reply, gladly I don‚Äôt use neither of that gun models.
---
Lol all good, thought I was missing out on something haha
---
I just hit 111 last night and have been collecting almost every plan since I started. At one point I gave like 200lbs of plans away to low level players and friends. Now I‚Äôm sitting at around 50lbs of plans. Without something like an auction board like in WOW, it‚Äôs going to be difficult to monitor market prices. I‚Äôm on the 76 market subreddit and prices there seem drastically inflated compared to what I see in game.
---
Sounds similar to mine... my first floor is build on the lower "tier" of a power line tower.
---
First, place a concrete foundation piece on the ground.  
---
Place a staircase on that.  
---
You'll likely have to fiddle with the height of the foundation to make the top of the staircase even with the first tier of the tower.
---
Connect the floor pieces to the staircase.
---
Once you have the floor in place, you should be able to remove the staircase and foundation.  
---
At that point, the only way to get up there is marsupial or jetpack.
---
Like the SBQ event.  Do your part!!
---
correct
---
Ah yes the notorious ghoul crawlers. And as soon as they die, they dive into the ground never to be seen again
---
Nobody buys atoms as it is lol
---
I was thinking instead of using perk cards to reduce weight, to have multiple different stashes for certain items, like ammo having their own separate stash without guns.
---
What do you sell them at?
---
I have Resistant Wetsuits (lvl2) and Shielded Road Leathers and Vault suits, but people aren't buying, and I was wondering if I was pricing them too high.
---
Sometimes at the sons of dane one there are 1 enemy per minute... Then others there are 300 ferals breaking that darn jukebox
---
Can you have just 1* Cav armor?
---
No idea. I run Uny/Cav
---
Maybe these should also have sub-folders to separate flavor notes/holotapes and quest related ones.
---
If you sell it for 1 cap the taxes can sometimes make you have 0 caps
---
Currently I use a Vampire Mole Miner Gauntlet (my weakest but keeps me alive for longest), Bloodied Puntering Power Fist and a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet, these last two alone, when I am bloodied easly reach the 2.5K in Damage... you can actualy see the health of the SBQ go down whenever you hit her (not much but you notice).
---
So players saying that they have bought them from vending and other players from 3-4K caps and others saying that they have saved up multiple sets is just erosions then. Or the fact than on an old character I had the plans without ever buying them, meaning I either got them from a quest reward or found them in a container somewhere out in the world. Yeah, sure. I definitely believe you random stranger :)
---
Even semi rare outfits sell well. I always have one witch and one skeleton costumes in my machine, at 30-35 caps, and every time I get back to my camp, they're gone.  
---
Same with the Marine Helmet. You can find one in every vending machine, but mines are at 29 caps, and I sell 3-4 every day.   
---
You won't become a millionaire that way, but who cares. Don't be greedy! I love seeing a level 35 buying the Stimpacks/Radaway he really needs for 4-5 caps each, and then buying an outfit because he can afford it.
---
50 caps sounds fair and reasonable
---
Had this happen several times.  I run in level 40 start the event it starts some high 100+ shows up, I ask over mic do you wanna team up? Nothing can you let me get a hit on the supervisors they graciously let me.  Just before the last wave starts a group of 3 one over 200 shows up and I ask the same questions, again silence(why can't people afford a 20 dollar headset/mic?) any way the last one shows up and bam one shot.  Wow, thanks man that was great.  Really bums a person out.  At least one guy was great the last ones really come on what are you trying to get here nothing over level 40 even drops.  I stopped doing the event since I more often then not start the event and get cheated out of the legendary drops.  It's the same all over, at least I can feel good never doing that as I will go out of my way to share the xp and loot often taking extra damage to lead the group of baddies over to others especially in Whitesprings where I've gone to just running a tesla rifle on my melee build so that I get a tag in and others can as well.
---
No, I'm not saying just have it be a hassle for the sake of being a hassle. I'm simply saying that, I'd rather have it be a hassle than a neutered, watered down system AND if they are going to lesson that hassle for us, then they need to make sure they don't... neuter or water down the system.
---
Thanks for sharing, I‚Äôm honestly curious with others opinions, because I don‚Äôt find it fun to one-shot high level enemies, I prefer the fight to last for a while at least.
---
Can we also get submenus for "Overseer's Logs the game won't let us drop that dominate the Holo tab" and "Random undroppable schematics and files and crap that stopped being relevant months ago and dominate the Misc tab, making finding the handful of actual items in it, like gunpowder and ore, a massive pain"?
---
Also, *please* get rid of the duplicate keys I have. My desire for tidiness goes notes whenever I see them, and it makes me super paranoid about picking up any keys I happen to stumble across because I don't know if I have them already.
---
I've never seen that be true, I just see posts about the visual glitch constantly on the sub. I'll have to do some more research, I guess. Thanks!
---
I wish more camps were centrally located on the map..
---
Im not saying people need to be in the forrest.. but if youre way out on the perimeter of the map.. chances are Im not gonna go there unless Ive got a quest really close by..
---
What is fancy pants for 500!
---
Its Bethesdas fault, stop blaming players
---
It's a pretty poor return for the paint. Both myself and a friend had very little and then suddenly got all the Knight ones in quick succession. Paladin and Elder still elude me although a, teammate did kindly paint my armour in Paladin colours while I still look for it myself. üòî
---
So do you know if the DPS is capped??
---
It helps to drown out the sounds of Scorchbeasts in the distance.
---
I have to disagree with the first par of your statement, "Building castles on Sand or Stone," since that's like saying the foundations for other games are bad.
---
Unless you meant to say "Building castles OF Sand or Stone, which can make it an aesthetic comment, not only a structural one.
---
&gt; those of us that find very limited enjoyment in the single player games because of the lack of challenge in them. 
---
Fine then, replace we with that, and still need with want.  
---
I also don't disagree with your positions for survival mode in the slightest, I was hoping that all the people that wanted a rust clone with a fallout skin would get somewhere to torment themselves. Figured that was the whole idea of survival mode, but it hasn't shaped up that way.
---
How do you know it was malicious?
---
Personally, I equip the Tesla Rifle when I *don't* want to instant-kill something.  It's one of the big reasons behind having the weapon in the first place - to tag rather than kill.  But can I guarantee that I haven't accidentally killed weaker Legendaries by mistake, because they are just that weak?  Absolutely not.
---
What‚Äôs funny about this is before player vending it was basically an unwritten rule if you sold basic ammo it was either free or if you did charge 1 cap per shell or round was pretty typical.  Why change now with player vending?
---
I sell most of my items like a mattress store - 50% off! But I'm still not moving things very quick. I just watch my inventory and just sell at a WS vendor if something has been sitting around for a while. 
---
At first, I would get low level guns and mod the hell out of them thinking when I was level 5-10 that I would have appreciated a suppressed 10mm auto...or combat rifle with all mods but NOPE that didn't work out at all. So I've tried to stick to more rare items. Or sell at ridiculously low prices. I have one bench that's just 20 caps or less.
---
So it's a crap shoot.  I also used to give plans that were found easily for free but stopped because people were taking them all for resale so now, for my time and energy, I sell for 5-10 caps and it's worked.
---
Some people can't play games without cheating, just let them get on with it.
---
Just have pride that you don't need to cheat to progress.
---
At low health, around 10-20% hp my tambo was getting 460-495 dmg
---
AA/E/90% Handmade or LAR
---
I often find them in the carnival north-west of vault 76. Usually at the back of the area on the rows of seats.
---
I just like it because it means I can spend less time on ammo supply.
---
Relatively stable?
---
You've got to be fucking kidding.
---
It crashed on tons of people yesterday. When I tried it on a high end PC with 100mb internet it stuttered constantly. Crashed both times a Nuke was launched, on two different servers.
---
Theres a reason that, outside of this sub, both the game and its devs are a running joke now.
---
This is 100% it. The only time I'm going to go to a vendor deep in the mire it's going to be because I was already on my way there, which is rare. 80% of the shops I visit are overpriced junk so I don't go out of my way to visit them. Really hoping they add a way to see a little more detail on what people have eventually.
---
I have it and sent a request
---
I once had to walk from Vault 76 to Mountainside Bed and Breakfast to get the 300 acid in my death bag that i had from farming Yao Guai.
---
I unfortunately am in the same boat. Level 173 and nothing to show despite grinding it for quite awhile. Have all but given up now and play other areas of the map.
---
I got mine legit and I could care less if someone benefited from this. JS
---
Well..... the ammo part is so true that it hurts.
---
BSODS on PC can be caused by faulting applications. They do run on hardware.
---
I had a friend take my bounty once.  I asked him politely to kill me.  He came over and one-shotted me.  Thanks!  Then he ate me.  That was not part of the deal!  How rude.  I was using that body.
---
What do you mean? I'm not sure that I understand.
---
After the patch i noticed that i couldn't fast travel to anyones camp (Player Vendor) after i died. Separate issue but on start up seems like you cant fast travel to ppls camps but u can travel to locations
---
25c or less.
---
Greed.
---
Ive turned in over 100 and only 1 paint. Stopped doing them so much now. Usually just once a gameplay now just because it's part of my routine now.
---
This has straight up been a problem since Fasnacht
---
I would prefer rotary to keyboard anyways. And it works for both PC and console.
---
I also don‚Äôt get locking water purifiers - there‚Äôs a max number they can hold before they stop producing. Even if someone takes them all it a)isn‚Äôt that many and b)doesn‚Äôt take long to refill.
---
Several times I have encountered a vendor with many locked purifiers selling purified water (once I saw 30 caps per purified water), which seems like insanity to me.
---
I will not pay more than 1cap/bullet. If someone has 45 for 1 cap each I will probably buy it all. If it‚Äôs at 2 I will buy none (at the beginning I sometimes would pay 2 but now I know it‚Äôs easy to just go to another vendor for a cheaper price.) I saw a vendor last night with all their ammo at 5 caps each! I put all my 38 in my vendor machine for 0 since I used to just dump it and I‚Äôm sure someone can use it. Everything else is 1.
---
Now that people are getting a sense of what typical/reasonable prices are it‚Äôs going to become harder and harder to sell things that are way overpriced, thankfully. Yay for capitalism!
---
I use Handmade, Hunting, and Lever Action with Raider armor aka glass cannon. I can‚Äôt take too many hits but neither can they.
---
Easy to say,hard to do.
---
Tracking everything a player does in an event would probably buckle the already buckled servers.
---
Considering that the mole miners aren't that big of a threat it really doesn't hurt to try and let everyone have a chance.
---
I was playing the other day and another player joined in just after it started. When the first boss turned up at one end of the room, the other player was at the far end, so I plugged the boss once then ran across to the other player and motioned him to follow me so he could get a shot in. Ended up he did the same for me for the last boss. Doesn't hurt to show a little courtesy considering it's just a game.
---
To be honest i think its a bit weak, im bloodied sniper i have only 2 points in ST (to redux chems weight) and i have a Bloodied knuckles just in case i need a body to body fight and with my build the knuckles dmg is 380+ with 20% health, also i have a Bloodied power fist who gives me 500+dmg.
---
LAR. 
---
Rifleman x3

Bloody mess

Grim reaper sprint
---
Better criticals
---
Gun fu
---
Adrenaline
---
High damage potential, lots of perks go well with bloodied. Downside is low health.
---
You avoided all of them in your response. As I said, you made some very good points. Here's one example of an inaccurate exaggeration: "proccing the burning effect 20 times in a second."
---
No at least 2*
---
Eh, and if they get no customers, then they know something has to change, right?  Why should the default value be anything less than what I would get selling it to a vendor?  That's a nice, agnostic starting value.  I should know if I'm pricing something more or less than what a vendor would give me because, as gothpunkboy said, it's already far less than what the vendor turns around and sells it for.  If you default it to being lower, you're manipulating the player economy, skewing prices downward to appease you, which doesn't make sense.
---
Snakey boys are hilarious every time.  
---
For invisible mobs here‚Äôs my strategy - at Whitesprings golf club I throw down mines at the entrance,the stairs and then the halls to the right and left on the top floor just in case there are invisible mobs.  Next I run to the left and attack the first sleeping bag where an enemy should be.  If a mine goes off or I get exp for attacking the sleeping bag I run outside and jump on the bus.
---
Now should I have to do this?  Probably not but it does work
---
Guns not being worth a crap is one of the two big reasons this is the first Fallout I skipped. (The lack of mods, and lack of stability being the other two).
---
I tried the game for hours on 2 occasions. I hate bullet sponges, and durability being shit just makes it worse. Told my friend I'd pass.
---
Give me a private game with mods, I'll consider it.
---
Yea you are, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
---
Bool story Cro
---
I was happy with the carpet...
---
Keys?
---
Yep, great location, close to the Whitespring too, so people don't hesitate to TP. And people visit the Train Station vendor there a lot.  
---
But don't build on the first lake below the road, it's MINE!
---
yes, I would love to see chems separated from food/drink. OR we can create our own list besides the quick wheel or whatever it‚Äôs
---
called.
---
I had just assumed they would be aesthetic companions, like you can have a baby deathclaw or a eyebot painted blue, and they wouldnt fight or have carry weight.
---
I'm pretty okay with that though, I dont want there to be a best companion because then everyone has the same one and I'll feel obligated to get the one with the most carry weight or something. 
---
If they had like a small passive effect like an eyebot that gives you 1 perception (shout out to ed-e) that would be neat, but it's as far as I think the gameplay effects should go.
---
I must have turned in over 100 since launch. Used to get BOS outfits and armor plans a lot. Never got a paint mod. 
---
In the past month I‚Äôve received one outfit.
---
At least 3. Cav is a tertiary effect.
---
Not that I am aware of. Just wood armor pieces and assaultron heads losing their modifiers after logging out and back in.
---
If they pick every lock they come across I‚Äôd Hope they dedicate a spot or three for their need to pick locks...
---
They should make it so it only notifies level 50+ players. Encryptid as well.
---
Np
---
I don't think removing a bugged property of these weapons is nerf. They ignore range. Thats bug. If that was fixed, they would still be very powerful. Just not as much when shot from half a mile.
---
But I somehow agree with you. Energy weapons deserve some straight buffs.
---
My problem with this particular meta is that is legacy and unobtainable for casual player besides purchasing a duped copy. If the only change they made was to return explosive lasers to loot pool, my opinion on this situation would change from "unacceptable" to "perfectly normal". Also, its not "I dont have it so fuck the people who do". I have four different ones, making them less efficient or more common are all moves that would "hurt my wallet". I just want it competetive and fair, and unlike many delusional people I dont mean "my shitbuild should stand a chance against powerbuild, balance broken", I just believe there is no place in meta for things unobtainable in the game.
---
Only 500? Shit i think I‚Äôm pushing 400 on my full-health unarmed build.
---
How many caps did you make off that glitch? Everyone seemed to be "renting" those plans for 1k or more.
---
It took me 2 hours to rebalance weapon and enemy health values in the FO4 kit. And that's only because the piece of shit doesnt purge old info from memory and has to be closed and reloaded every 30 minutes on high end rigs. A bug, by the way, since at least Oblivion, because Betheada cant code for shit.
---
My setup i use:
---
Bloodied explo handmade for mid and close range, 
---
Bloodied explo lever action for long range, 
---
Bloodied explo Dragon for the high level enemies (sheepsquatch, SB)
---
In my eyes, if they neutered their perk system to the point that they make lock picking and hacking passive then they might as well make all non-combat perks passive. Right now the system encourages different builds with friends, and only offers a minor inconvenience for solo players (which I am myself). If they changed the perk system to cater to the crying, then they kill a major and unique aspect of the multiplayer system. The same goes with boss loot (the only proper solution there would be to change the mechanics so that everyone gets the chance to focus on the side objectives and the main objective to: see that the event has less of a failure rate, and that everyone gets the chance to deal damage to the boss to get their damage participation loot).
---
im not a fan of one shotting, but bullet sponge enemies are crap as well
---
we need enemies with better tactics and deadlier arsenals, as opposed to just standing there and taking our bullets, scorch do seem to try and take cover, but everything else just stands there
---
Same.  I eventually stopped even bothering with doing the event.
---
Lots of player vendors offer them, for 250 to 1000 caps. 250 is a steal, 300-350 is an ok price, don't buy anything above that.
---
98.9% of anything else that the community "whines about" = no change. Yea dude, *real* clear pattern there.
---
Oh you're right
---
The power fist is basely higher than the tambo and has mods, if I had one I'd be using that. But a bloodied sniper build has no comparison with melee.. it's just straight different usage in perks/specials. Sure, you can utilize high E for any bloodied; but sniper v melee cards are completely different and range in usage
---
‚àû is even rounder
---
1. If you are short on space, then price to sell. If you're not in any hurry to sell things, then start high and work your way down until they sell. Some people operate on low profit high volume while others are high profit low volume. I sell plans and junk cheap to keep them moving because I pick up everything I see. But I price the legendaries high as I don't farm them much and I have a few good ones that I don't really care if they sell fast or not.
---
2. Agreed. I have a bunch of one-star two-shot, bloodied, and instigating weapons that would be great for someone switching their build or hasn't been able to farm or afford an entry level weapon of their chosen weapon type. I've met plenty of high level players that didn't have a single legendary that matched their chosen build and were struggling.
---
I know it's not what you want to hear but Molotovs are the way to guarantee you get a hit on the boss.  I toss those bad boys out regardless of the event then start doing secondaries/support.
---
in fallout 4 you don't have a notes tab just misc. 
---
I don't see why they can't add a new tab for chems.
---
The first time I noticed this (before it was ‚Äúpatched‚Äù) my 2nd gun disappeared from my inventory for a good 5 min. The game literally waited till I thought it was a lost cause then boom back in my inventory a few fast travels later..
---
There is a clear pattern of pvp losers asking for nerfs and those nerfs happening‚Äîimpacting PVE as well.
---
Can you do four shots from laser rifle inna second? You can. Can you hit your target four times in a second? Basically no recoil, yes, you can. Does if fire multipple shots? It does. Does each of them explode, damaing the target in AoE? Yep. Do each hit proc the related effects? Yes again. Is 20 burning ticks in a second achievable? Its common.
---
Are there even any tools available to us to protect the friendly creatures? There's no taunt, no root, no stun, you probably can't stagger these behemoth bosses. Grenades? Body blocking doesn't work because enemies just push you away. Perhaps we can cripple them? I can try to cripple the boss when I get around to trying the event on my shotgun character but for now I wanted to spitball strategies.
---
"I ate his liver with some silt beans and a nice Nukashine."
---
i have no perks for melee, im sniper.
---
Normally I give them the benefit of the doubt but he tried it with all 3. He had a charging barrel so instead of tapping he charged it up each time. Luckily we all got hits on the first 2 but the last one spawned right in front of him and before the mole miner turned green he killed it instantly. 
---
I hope it was jus an accident but I do that event several times a day and can usually tell when it‚Äôs an accident or they just don‚Äôt care to let others get a hit in.
---
Merely removing the stairs after placing the floor doesn‚Äôt work for me. Though I would like to see pics of your finished camp if you have any.
---
The problem is a game design philosophy issue. A frankly stupid one.
---
Bethesda believe that one way to "balance" powerful weapons, is make them take up more inventory space. In older games, they would make them larger, so as to eat more inventory slots. Here, This is accompliahes by increasing their weight.
---
So each of you add, increases weapon weight in a cumulative fashion. For "balance." Its absurdly stupid, completely illogical, utterly immersion wrecking and makes no sense...but that's never stopped them.before.
---
Source: same stupid system as Fallout 4.
---
Examples? I've never seen people being rude in requests
---
Yes, this is why im telling you that is a bit weak, i have no melee perks and my damage is almost like you with full melee perks..
---
Perfectly preserved pie = 10K caps.  Saw that twice already.
---
I found Anne last night on the light house all the way in the top ( the one with the mothman event )
---
I figure this location is easier then wavy Willard‚Äôs to spot and to maybe hop
---
i think the legendary drops in events should
---
go to everyone that meets a metric for time played in the event and that they participated. otherwise entire servers would show up to events and then do literally nothing and gain free drops.
---
yup.
---
Where exactly do you get off speaking for the entire community and putting your desires above everyone else, just because you consider them "weak"?
---
You want to talk about whiny entitlement?  Look in the mirror.
---
Lol^ I‚Äôm just glad none of these bugs have been like the Anthem bug I encountered. Froze my PS4 on a black screen and no buttons controller or console would work. Had to unplug completely and do the whole safe start. I let that happen twice and decided Anthem was not ready.
---
Sure, but I was mostly thinking about items you cant sell to a vendor.
---
I like it, great idea and execution! But you made me sad when I realised those are not buildable stairs. I want better stairs so much!
---
Honestly the explosive legendary effect should never have been in the game for any weapon period. It's seriously messed up that a legendary explosive automatic weapon will 100% always be better than any actual explosive weapon (auto grenade launcher, missile launcher, even the fatman) and they even nerfed the Demolitions Expert perk because of this issue, resulting in even the already crap explosive weapons being even worse.
---
Here's a potential solution though for keeping legendary explosive weapons in the game: legendary explosive weapons require you to craft explosive ammunition which is as resource heavy if not even more resource heavy than crafting 40mm grenades, missiles, and mini nukes are. Explosive ammunition also weighs more than normal ammunition and is affected by the Ordinance Express perk.
---
Yes, I'm salty as hell that the amount of time and resources it takes to be a heavy weapons explosives expert results in laughable damage output.
---
My same feeling when the refrigerator mod cuts weight by half
---
Wait you can‚Äôt? I know for the green turf floors I‚Äôve been able to. Is it not this way for everyone?
---
Easy to say. Very hard to code fairly. If they just allow anyone in the area credit, you will be back here complaining that people hiding out and doing nothing get full credit.
---
Because there is still no risk/reward for survival mode. It feels more like a battle royal/leaderboard assassin mode. Find the best player, and kill them for survival points. There is no thrill of having to fight for your location or possessions.   
---
You have had the right for months to make your comments about "needs" rather than "wants", and they have been good suggestions. As they correct more and more with the game with your "needs", the influence to the game feels more like a co-op singleplayer experience than a multiplayer survival game. Don't give us shit about using the word need over want when this community has been plagued by the "needs" of others that have shaped the changes to this game.
---
Exactly. 
---
Pretty soon, you're going to NEED refrigeration just to play.
---
Fuck this. Betheada are no longer worth supporting.
---
He won‚Äôt , you‚Äôre lucky it wasn‚Äôt breach and clear status
---
Yeah that is the point though it is constant switching for minor loot gains. In precious games you could use stat boosting chems to bypass to an extent your lock picking or hacking level or in 4 you had no limits to number of perks active. 
---
So in FO4 even if I only had 4 perception I could have 8 perception perks active because previous games the perk level only dictated which perks you can pick not how many.
---
There is no such set up in 76. So it either needs to be passive or make it a one star perk since I'm not going to be looting any legendaries or like 20 screws and 100 5.56 ammo from locked container.
---
It. Takes. Forever.  Just got the Paladin paint.  Now the grind continues for Elder paint.  To put in perspective, I farm tech at the Enclave Bunker exclusively (in those desks).  I always check for X-01 mods while I'm there.  I've been there so many times I've found 5 x-01 Calibrated shock mods and 4 jet pack mods.  It keeps me outta trouble and we all need a hobby.
---
Its a known issue, but Bethesda refuses to fix it
---
What damage? Your gun? Power fist? Power armor knuckles? Lol
---
It's because everyone's failing the event or not fully ranking up the friendlies so they miss out on the best rewards. Forest, meet trees. This event is almost like Bethesda trolling us because they knew this exact scenario would happen. "Let's give them a choice of quest rewards or a legendary loot pinata and see what they do." Pinata every time... \*shakes head\*.
---
It'd actually be kind of an interesting mechanic if we actually had to use products like Abraxo in the game to turn dirty versions of items into clean ones. Thus you'd build a toilet (which, in theory, is made from reclaimed junk found in the wild) and then you'd have to fix it up. Walls, toilet, appliances, and other items would have stages of funk to 'em.
---
Gives the junk in the world a bit of functionality.
---
Just keep at it. I have all but the one that's not in game. Sentinel i think it is. Took allot of tds
---
he probably wanted a snack!
---
I don't get why it doesn't act the same as being in a team. Whenever I'm in a team, I can loot enemies I didn't hit and they can loot mine. Seeing as events group you together in what is essentially a team, I don't get why it doesnt have the same benefits.
---
Oh guess what, you actually have to think to win a fight now and can not rely on OP armor to carry you to victory. Wow. What this game needs is a notably longer time to kill in PVP, in order to make stealth camping less effective, for this, DR should just matter more, creating more time for you to react and outplay opponents, but not through OP legendary gear. There is still some problematic stuff in the game, such as explosive laser weapons that can not drop anymore, but at the same time are possibly the best choice for PVP right now, which hopefully will see a fix in the coming weeks or months. With the general sandbox eventually reaching a properly balanced state at some point, the overall gameplay for solo players may need a little bit of fixing indeed, because, as you said and as is true, proper group play will be the one major factor in PVP. Lone Wanderer is meant to provide advantages for solo players, it is quite clear however, that group play offers more advantages to each member of the group individually, up to the point, where they will be superior to solo even with Lone Wanderer. Think about Empaths and perk card sharing, you can recreate the effects of Lone Wanderer and even go further, depending on how coordinated the builds of your team are. I like that aspect of the game, it is something that rewards proper planning. The way people now try to PVP bait is mostly to blame on Bethesda I think, it is just the result of how PVP works. Nobody wants to fight disadvantagous fights, the same type of people that would never attack me on my high level main char, would often try to start a fight while on my low level char. It is human nature and Bethesda has implemented a system that caters to exactly this kind of behavior. Survival should have been a better option for PVP, but due to the highly unbalanced state in which Survival was released, it failed, again, because people do not want to fight at a disadvantage. So many people without Assassin Sentinel and potent weapons of course would rather keep playing adventure, it is the safer option and just the existence of this option already killed Survival in that form for most players. Train station camping and other Survival sepcific issues, such as the recent trap CAMP exploits were the final nail in the coffin.
---
Is that with a non-stealth build? I'd like to try using Adrenaline but I don't have many spare points after Sneak, Action Boy, Covert Operative and Escape Artist. Or do you find Grim Reaper's Sprint kicks in often enough to make Action Boy unnecessary? Thanks in advance!
---
This community is a dull.

Rather than asking for new contents, they ask for completely useless things. Game lacks of new contents, enemies since months....ask for them instead.
---
You‚Äôre being downvoted but you‚Äôre absolutely right. I expect to be downvoted as well, by the very same people you are warning Bethesda about.

I sell plans mostly , all go for they default prices but the drinks ( since I own a bar kinda lol ) and weapon plans just inflate for the fun of it , don‚Äôt mind the other plans but weapons plans are different lol
---
I agree. I didn‚Äôt really feel the immersion of the game till the first time I came home to a nuked camp.
---
I think you missed that this thread is tagged as a "discussion" which means it's a place to talk about vending tips.
---
I think the OP is and should be expecting the comment section to fill in the blanks. I have a lot of hours into this game and I still don't know every rare item.
---
It's very useful to anyone who scrolls through the comments and also creates a place for others to discuss what sells well and rare items along with pricing.
---
I honestly don't understand why your so opposed to an open discussion about player vending.
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs just a joke. I know I put mine in my store for 25k as a laugh when vending first came out. Nobody would ever pay anywhere near that, it‚Äôs mainly just to say ‚Äúlook, I managed to get one‚Äù
---
Diffuses.
---
Agreed. SELL YOUR INSTIGATING 1* ITEMS.
---
Actually a very fun and reasonable suggestion that would make the game interesting. I usually auto-downvote "remove explosive" posts, but, well, game would be funnier like that. More variations to playstyle.

---
What?  You have a problem with stuff being labeled with random strings pulled from the game?
---
I had that as a hunch, thanks for the confirmation!
---
I don‚Äôt understand why this hasn‚Äôt been addressed yet. I love the game but this is such a huge problem. I‚Äôve missed out on so much legendary boss loot because I‚Äôm too busy PTFO as Bethesda wanted me too and it feels like I get punished in a sense because I don‚Äôt get a chance to loot the legendaries like the guy who just hides in a corner just tagging bosses not contributing as all. Some acknowledgement that the team is aware that this needs changing would be nice.
---
Not too often, honestly. 4 out of 5 of the camps I visit clearly started with a foundation leading to a staircase leading to the typical floating monstrosity
---
I'm not surprised youd do more, I just dunno what point you're trying to make
---
You say that like PvE isn't already easy as hell using absolutely no legendary weapons/armor or PA at all.
---
Just because you don't like to PvP doesn't mean Bethesda shouldn't consider it when making balance changes.
---
And at this point, I would be fine rewarding the freeloaders that camp the event and wait for rewards if it meant I got better rewards and not have to worry about tagging the alpha. I didn't really care about the campers at Fasnacht as long as their were others that showed up to help. And, if anything, having more people show on the map at the event helps draw more players to the event too. I know if I don't see at least a couple high-level players at Encryptid, I'm not going because I don't want to blow through 50 stims to do it all by myself.
---
I believe the dataminers has reported that initiate paint isn't dropping right now and I believe you need that one before the next one drops.
---
See I dont even need to look for the tech documents. I seem to have an endless source, so I just spawn at camp venture, hand in the tech, get my 25 caps plus the quest reward and then server hop, then run right back into camp venture. I've got multiple of the clothing drops like science scribe outfit and engineers outfit but not a single paint.
---
This predates the last patch.  I don't know what causes the Scorchbeast corpses that spontaneously drop in front of me, but I've seen it for months.  Every now and then, I'll have one flopped over my CAMP.
---
Who buys quantities of ammo small enough to make that an issue?
---
I usually have about a thousand rounds of 5.56 in my store for one cap apiece, and I've never had anyone buy less than a few hundred at a time.
---
I never had as many disconnects as other players seemed to report, and lately the connection has been bulletproof.  I rarely disconnect.
---
Who can really say why?  I'm on original XBox One console.  I have the game installed on an external drive.  Maybe the hardware has something to do with it.
---
I almost never play in a Team anymore.  I rarely take Workshops.  Maybe the in-game behavior has something to do with it.
---
I live in WV, which is known as having some of the worst Internet in the country.  But I have one of the best plans that my provider offers, so maybe my Internet speed has something to do with it.
---
Unknown.  Not enough data to figure out what is causing some people to disconnect and others not to.  Maybe Bethesda has that data, but they're tight-lipped if so.
---
Very few folks PVP.   Their needs should be subordinated to those that don‚Äôt.

I meant of. With the amount of salty comments from the saltiest people in this community, grammar is the least of my worries.   
---
What I am trying to say is that every other multiplayer game that has catered to making the game easy has become a shell of what that game used to be. Yes, it got sales... but for what, a year, two years? Then it died?   
---
Meanwhile, the game developers that have stuck by their guns and didn't allow the community to completely neuter their vision of the game are seeing absolute success. The sales are lower for them, yes, but they have a community that trusts their vision and will continue to stick by their game until the servers come down, or they make a second installment.   
---
Bethesda has singleplayer Fallout installments you can play; you can ask them to allow for a co-op mode in their future singleplayer installments of Fallout games. DON'T ruin this installment be demanding they make it like their past installments or by neutering it with ease, streamlined QOL changes.
---
Ah fair enough
---
RNG, I've finished my collection with elder at lvl 206 (now I'm 244) but the rewards were irregular - from Knight to Officer (4 plans) I get in 3 days, but for Paladin waited a week, while for Elder almost 2 weeks. All with similar regularity of quests finished daily.
---
If you're crashing out test your machine, even if it's been stable with other games for years.
---
I had crashing problems as well at first, and only with Fallout 76. Had to dial back my GPU OC that previously passed benchmarks with ease and pull some RAM that was revealed to be unstable with Memtest86 after hours of testing.
---
I know on my console if the update gets interrupted the whole game is deleted. So what was a 5 gig update turns into reinstalling the 60 gig game as a whole. I don't know if it's the same for PC but that was my first assumption. It didn't add another 60 gigs to my hard drive though so everything looks the way it did before the update.
---
If others are around I switch out my 1shot super sledge for a weaker weapon so I purposefully don‚Äôt 1 shot. It is doughy to go in and kill everything in 1 shot. You do not prove you are amazing just that you are a sick for doing that. Uncool. 
---
Also agree on clearing the adds. I like doing this so the main group of tanks can kill easy. It is integral in mechanics of any boss right to mitigate adds. You should be appointed loot from SBQ or anything as such. You are as much a part of the battle as the person nailing the queen.

As I get closer to perfect gear I'm less hesitant to let go of stuff now, but I still keep certain things cause they're useful.  Funny how a 1\* Anti-Armor Assaultron Blade comes in handy now that you need that weapon to do the Robotics possum badge.  I still keep some of the quest legendaries - Daisycutter just so I always have a fat man, the mistress of mystery items, and yes All Rise though really I suppose I can get rid of it.

What players are doing is configuring the gun for max stability, recoil control and smallest spread, at the cost of durability and other benefits.

You can do much the same with the Gatling Plasma and even the Harpoon gun to a much smaller extent.

In short it's tactics and laser rifles are good in large part because of how much you can customize the weapon, 
---
    
---
I'll add a quick disclaimer, I don't use a Legacy Energy weapon (however I own a few), but I extensively test nearly all the combos as they pop up, especially when people start complaining about "OP".     
---
(Check my post history and you'll see why).   
---
We should be very very cautious with asking for removal of anything for a number of reasons, and it should be a last resort for a number of reasons.    
---
-It's a slippery slope, and the past shows once a company does it once, they are likely to start doing it more and more often.   
---
-Removing items in this manner **DOES** cause people to quit games, and don't do the knee jerk "good we don't want them" because it's bad for everyone when people from the community leave, and x20's as many PvE'ers would leave over the few PvP'ers effected.     
---
-Mob rule is always bad (no offense to anyone).    
---
-Because in the future it could be you.      
---
-All items don't have to be available to all players, even causal ones.. (This is not elitism, but the core fact rarity and desirability encourages replay, this is hard psychology behind casinos etc.)
---
-They are not that hard to obtain, when you dedicate yourself to trading for one...   
---
I started with Zero Legacy energy weapons about a month ago and have nearly a dozen at the moment, of different flavors, for testing.    
---
Could go on with the bullet points, and I appreciate you own a few as well, as it does lend creditability vs the usual "Torches and Pitchfork" cries of the HaveNot's, but I still disagree when anyone cries for removal of Nerfing.   
---
Do agree It would be fantastic if they added the explosive back in, a modified variant for each type of energy weapon so it would fit thematically wouldn't be that hard either.  
---
And before I forget, there are counters to the Legacy energy weapons in PVP, as a medium scale trader on [PC] I help outfit a few PVP groups (including some "Raiders") and they've come up with effective and balanced ways to mitigate the incoming DMG and strike back effectively.
---
I play on Xbox and have been killed a couple times in Survival by people quite literally on the other side of the map. In each instance it was someone I had killed earlier and otherwise hadn't done anything out of the ordinary. I messaged the last guy who did it asking "how did you get me from the other side of the map?" but he never responded. No idea if this was due to an exploit or just another weird bug.
---
Looks like the same that the display bug with the purveyor, but worse.....
---
Yep, a good Camp is hard to find on Xbox. It‚Äôs usually floating, some box with the same patterns, etc.

Its not abysmal. If I was given a way to get my best in slot gear easily, then what endgame would there be? Yes, it can be rough, and random, and based on luck. But if killing the SB Queen gave you what you wanted every time... what would you do when you got everything you wanted?

High maintenance costs so that you‚Äôre not prone to always use them. Like robots requiring fusion cores and high reparation costs everytime they‚Äôre being destroyed
---
For the most part I agree, other than pricing and 1*s. I then to price similarly but while taking my time, and the items rarity into consideration.  And along with those factors I also try to catch late what the need vs the want behind that item. I.e. If it's more of a necessity like meds,  armor or food I tend to price cheaper, If it's a luxury like an explosive wepon, I jack the price abit. And as far as 1*s I mostly agree, 99% of em should just b recycled, but a few sell good, like 2S and Explosive aslong as you price them reasonably (300-750 caps) pending on rarity/base item.
---
I was so stoked when I found that during the Beta! At that point I didn't know that you couldnt decorate your base with junk because I was going to collect all the bears.
---
&gt; You can find one in every vending machine, but mines are at 29 caps, and I sell 3-4 every day.

And it's a better deal for you than selling them to the vendors (where you'll get 20-28 caps depending on your charisma and buffs).

Great spot, and even though I'm not focused on vending, MANY players stop by and usually buy a couple things.

It‚Äôs not perfect. There‚Äôs a point system that marks you on the map if you‚Äôre at the top. So less of a hardcore mode, and more of just a straight up pvp mode. But still better than nothing, and they‚Äôre still tweaking it. 
---
There‚Äôs also another new mode coming out soon, but I don‚Äôt think we know a ton about it yet.
---
Does the level handmade matter?
---
Your prior comment was logically irrelevant.  The issue is not whether Bethesda makes changes due to community requests generally‚Äîbut rather whether it nerfs.
---
You shouldn't. In my opinion, the cons of this mod (huge DR and ER loss) are too significant to actually use it. I prefer refrigerating one, even though it cuts the carry capacity of backpack by half. And farming possum badges is very easy - I do daily both repeatables and 2-3 campfire events and got at least one badge daily.
---
All you can do is hop and monitor here while you do it.

It took me 6 hours of hopping to get it

Does it matter if I make level 15 or 45?
---
Also does it matter if I craft level 15 vs 45?

 One of the reasons I avoid group events. I use Combat Knives a lot. My Nocturnal 40% Speed one after a few kills one shots very many things. Took a Legendary from a guy while farming the Golf Club and surrounding area as I had no choice. 
---
 As well I don't have the luxury of fooling with my prey, I am right in its face, and it needs to die fast or I suffer Damage.
---
I agree with most of your post, I just dont think making lockpick and hacking passive would ruin the game or game balance. You'd still have to waste 6 perk choices in order to be able to hack or pick everything, all making them passive does is save a little bit of time and make it more streamlined. I wouldn't want every non combat perk to be passive, simply those two. Or change it so one card can be levelled up 3 times.
---
You absolutely cannot let the boss get near the friendly. Run in front of it as a sacrifice or otherwise grab its aggro to get it away from the animal. Especially the squatch with the quill bomb.
---
Sorry, not possible. Check the game files if you would like to know how incendiary damage works. This discussion is irrelevant and is detracting from your good points. Good day!
---
Same thing happened to me last night!
---
I have never heard of anyone receiving signs and letters as a quest reward or finding them laying around in world.  In my experience, most of the time when people say they have multiple copies of the plan in their possession they are confused and actually have multiple copies of the Small Letters plans.
---
This is fact. Most of the PP events I have attended include a group of gun-toting non-PA builds doing loops through the zone waiting for legendaries. You better be quick when the boss pops or there will be tears.

Suppressor was the first one I learned lol!

---
I didn't say a single suggestion about correcting the game(unless you count not disagreeing with you on survival mode), thanks for the straw man tho. As for a co-op singleplayer experience, the game did start as just that: ["76 is the multiplayer design from fallout 4"](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=152).

its far from finished.   My camp budget is shot, likely because of all the stuff on the ground.

---
I can definitely see that being a problem, along the same lines as being able to one shot other legendary mobs that people don‚Äôt have time to tag. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know the best solution. If you make it so everyone in the event gets the reward, then you grossly open the game up to leechers, which is already a problem on a lot of SBQ fights with people just sitting in the bunkers after tagging her - that would make it worse, if all you have to do is be in the area. 
---
On the other hand, people not getting rewards because the main objective died so quickly isn‚Äôt right either. Is the underlying problem the fact that some main objectives die too quickly? I hate to say it but I think some main bosses really just need a hp buff, or scaling. I think the SBQ scales a little too much for the people around her, but events like Free Range seem perfectly tuned - I can solo it if no one comes, or if 20 people show up it‚Äôs still about the same fight time as me soloing it, without the Sheepsquatch feeling like a bullet sponge. 
---
TL;DR I think some mobs just need better scaling.
---
I've yet to run into any player vendor that has them.
---
Yeah I know I fixed the mistake. Damn I missed the action hero so if I don‚Äôt sell it then imma name it Action Hero
---
Excuse me? What exactly are you talking about?   
---
My opinion is a majorly shared opinion, just like your opinions about QOL changes are a popular shared opinion too. The difference is, you have your Fallout games that cater to the type of game you want this game to be AND your opinions shadow ours. Read any QOL suggestion post on this reddit and I bet you'll find comments from people who share the same ideals that I have. The difference is, the game is sitting on the fence right now between what it was created it be and what you want it to be made into. Our opinion is as equally popular, we just don't complain and cry about it as much because we like the state of the game and the vision they have for it.   
---
My only entitlement is that I purchased a Fallout game with a vision from Bethesda, a vision that I liked and believed in, and I'm only encouraging that they stick to their vision. Your entitlement is that you get your Fallout game, which is exactly like every other Fallout game that has been released.
---
I know one of the ways to help with one of those issues **Lack of participants**. Make it so when I fast travel or use the elevator I don't crash lol, attempted to go there with elevator 14 times all failed and 9 times via event icon when it was happening and it just crashes.
---
I'd love to catch up on voice chat, maybe exchange some knowledge, and if you could hook me up with more PvP oriented people. I wanted to have some interesting organised PvP and its most fun when two+ 4 person groups compete. Yes, a rich person can get themselves into legacy gear, but while I'm i.e. QE Harpoon user that utilises lots of similar mechanics, I don't complain there's something wrong with it because - while rare - its accessible.
---
There's also what you could call my hidden agenda. The most effective way to play right now against majority of players is extremely boring due to how certain weapons can hit at unlimited range while others cannot, hence so often its just camping the high ground and denying your opponents any access to range where their weapons do anything. I will oppose all things that enforce this as most efficient playstyle.
---
Blame who you want
---
I started off doing two-handed melee, but I became more of a melee generalist after my first big Legendary drops were one-handed and unarmed.  Never went back to two-handed after that.  It's just painfully slow in comparison and it's not uncommon for enemies to block it as a result, unless you've got the 40% swing speed bonus on one of them.
---
Unarmed is the best, IMO, provided you aren't reliant on Power Armor or fight in Nuke Zones.  You only need to devote 3 SPECIAL points to its damage perks (Iron Fist) and it generally hits harder out-of-the-box.  I'm Bloodied/Unyielding, but even at 50% HP, my Power Fist still hits for about 800, which is more than enough to one-shot most enemies, and it only gets more damaging from there.
---
Fast travel to Whitesprings, the red car on the left when you walk straight forward to the front door is where the tourist will spawn right on the hood. I had good luck finding it here first try. Good luck to you!
---
But looks delicious!
---
2000 is better. especially if they expect us to have a economy. or just make the shops seperate stash weights.
---
This. It‚Äôs a very easy fix, just adjust the damage when certain weapons are used on players. They‚Äôve been doing this already. Just need to reduce damage from laser weapons when used on players that‚Äôs all.
---
You gave me a good hearty laff with the Officer Earl bit. If I had more motivation Id give you gold :D
---
As far as I know there isn't any other way. After you get rank of possum, you can only get possum badges from repeatables and event.
---
I think ammo at 2 caps per is too high.  I set mine at 1 cap, though I think they'd be better off letting us bulk ammo so we can sell it for a fraction of a cap per round.
---
Oh I didn't know you had access to the data detailing how many people are playing and of those people how many participate in PvP. Could you share please?
---
Seriously though, the changes made were for the better of both PvP and PvE. You really think it was appropriate for TSE shotguns to one shot everything or that a full set of sentinel armor should make you practically invincible in PvE? If you do, I'll have to respectfully disagree with you because in my opinion playing a multiplayer game with OP players swooping in and one hitting everything before you can react at all really kills the experience and isn't fun at all.
---
I too don‚Äôt find it exciting, but like I said, I‚Äôm curious.
---
Mmmm...... experience with other mmos teaches me that what they are going to do is change meta from time to time, there‚Äôs no desire to really balance a mmo game, the goal is keeping players perpetually grinding for the ‚Äúnew meta‚Äù.
---
they may have had mics, just set to team chat.
---
I would be extremely grateful if you corrected me where I was wrong, as I wrote all that to the best of my knowledge. Please explain the stacking mechanics of incidentary damage so I could correct my post.
---
Well, not entirely true... griefers have figured out how to make "team" mechanics work for them, and use it to f*ck with other players.
---
Did you have a price in mind you could let it go for?
---
They were too busy correcting the issue with players receiving free topiaries.
---
The legit way to do that is The Dragon
---
I fully support that.  That is a clever way of accommodating both user bases‚Äô needs.  Make the legendary prefixes operate differently in Adventure versus Survival.   That is an idea worth pushing.
---
Thanks again for correcting me! It's difficult to speak without you around to inform me of my validity. Furthermore thank you for mediating this community and it's users, myself included. You leave no room for a conversation with dissenting views, I'm truly happy for your ignorant bliss. Take care cowboy.
---
Only disagree with  your ammo pricing... only ammo that should be sold for more than 1c each is cryo/plasma/40mm/missiles
---
I have a pointing vault boy with a light on his back just to point to the switch to enter my camp. Other than that I do silly things. Two portable toilets on the side, each with a light in and a men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs sign on. Beside it is a water pump with a ‚Äúwash your hands‚Äù sign next to it. Even putting small potted plants around my Vault Girl statue to make it look asthough she‚Äôs standing in grass. It makes it feel somewhat lived in. And I made it a slightly odd shape too xD
---
You are talking some easy to implement logic here..... Or even it does let you take the item it just overwrites the previous one..
---
It was probably the server you were on resetting. They do that every now and then.
---
Thank you for accepting the blessing of my opinions.
---
You ok?
---
Right now the popular opinion on this post is equal, even at zero upvotes, and I hope that reddit has a system in place for posts that don't get upvoted but get attention.   
---
So yes, I stand correct in everything that I have said. This reddit community seems split between "keep the vision alive and keep this as a challenging survival game" and "make this game like every other Fallout game to-date". I didn't mean weak as an insult, just as in, there are people that rather have a game cater to them rather than them cater to the game.
---
Stabilized is really awesome!
---
Yes, I can't stand it when the level 300 one taps the legendary mole miner on uranium fever.
---
Well I'll be damned if I knew this one.
---
sure youre on the right sub?
---
I‚Äôve been looking for this mod/plan for forever! Still no luck
---
the same thing happened to me a few minutes ago.also missing doors. and terminals for protectron. server hop wont fix it.
---
Thank you very much for the suggestion. I had been taking random landscape pictures with no luck. Off to take a picture of a turret in the rain!
---
Thanks, I had no idea!
---
It's a steep price for sure, but I'm happy knowing that it's possible to complete the Possum Chemist challenge!
---
watch the new arktos event.. one popped last night (this morning). three of us were in the building. me, a 140, and a level 95 in nuka cola power armor (who triggered the event). i was the only one putting items in the troughs, the 140 was just meandering around killing stuff, and the 95 was sitting in a corner in a closet upstairs.. event failed of course, and the 95 jumped servers..
---
lol :D
---
Not at all. Craft the lowest level one since it uses the least materials.
---
That's weird. Do you fast travel to vendors, or only check the ones you're passing by? If you really want some, fast travel to the vendors on your server, then change server, and do it again.  
---
Before FT'ing, make sure the vendor has something in the 'Aid' section, that's where you'll find your **Mutation Serums**.
---
Care to elaborate? I don't follow.
---
If you pick up a key without reading what it is you would want to be able to find it in your inventory to figure out where it goes
---
Interesting, and makes sense. Hard to beleive that this mechanic has been hiding in plain sight this whole time. Thanks!
---
It was an atom shop paint that was in the shop a long time ago
---
I'm with you. I just want ED-E with the recon attachment and battle music
---
Theres only so many greek letter plans 1 man can sell
---
On PS4, sadly! Appreciate the offer, though!
---
Level 145 and I finlly got one!  2\* TSE Combat Rifle from the Legendary venrod for just 50 scrip (After plenty of lousy crap including 2x 3\* assaultron heads that lost a star overnight). So happy with that as I prefer rifles. Not trying to make anyone jealous- just reassurng that they still exist and drop without any duping.
---
Plans are my biggest sellers, anything I get that doesn't appear to be ultra common (no pearl grip pistol plans) goes on the vending machine.  So far I've had to make at leas 30k caps on those alone.  Especially the ones that are from the quests like the scout and Biv ones.  
---
I'm also now selling the Stimpack Diffusers on my vending machines, 100 caps each which I think would be reasonable, so people can complete that Badge.
---
but i like building on hills...
---
Nice to hear of more positive interactions. There are many of them every day, many more than we hear about. Seems like folks are more likely to report griefing than good experiences so thanks for doing the latter.
---
I have a big friends list.  Not because I have friends.  Nor because I‚Äôm friendly. But I trade a lot.  And a lot of the folks I trade with are those with perfect PVP gear.  When I log on, perhaps 5% of them are in Survival at any given time.   Even PVPers spend the majority of their time in Adventure.   The PVP tail shouldn‚Äôt be wagging the PVE dog.
---
I just didn't know what you meant about survival mode, that is all.   
---
And I agree with you. It was in a piss poor state for a multiplayer Fallout game (reason why I avoided purchasing it until it represented something more multiplayer than singleplayer Fallout 4 with friends). But, Bethesda has two routes they can follow now. Make it the multiplayer survival game they intended and told us it would be, where we actually have to survive the wasteland with our friends or fight other players. Where our choices and characters are unique. OR, they could listen to everyone else and revert the game back to the  ["76 is the multiplayer design from fallout 4"](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=152).
---
Yep. Nothing like a pink castle to make a post apocalyptic wasteland more immersive...
---
Maybe a proximity check between the welcome mat and traps or monsters. For example, a round bubble as proximity of the welcome mat like our camp border. I take anything to be able to spawn properly in camp :|
---
You can find paint and paint brushes in the wasteland, but aren't allowed to paint.
---
I am the beard guy, defiantly a joke, atleast in its demanding nature. Also not overly worried about topic, tho I would infact like a longer beard. But obviously not going to quit game over it :P
---
What if the stimpack diffuser healed all nearby friendlies as well?
---
No mods are sold for less then 50 caps from vendors so i gotta say some mark up should be expected (spent 150 on a polymer scout armor mod to flip yesterday) obvi diff story for mods found round the world...
---
I 100% disagree with your (and other player's) demands for perk loadouts.
---
LOCK PERK CHOICES, and allow for respec'ing every 50 levels (or some other arbitrary amount).  This "jack of all trades whenever it suits you" thing is jarring and OP. 
---
Pick a build, work towards it... if you wanna be the most amazing craftsman ever... then you can't also be the master thief AND Golden Gloves champion AND Olympic Level athlete AND Hawkin's-class scientist. 
---
The current "swapping cards" things makes this game a bunch of "lone wolves that sometimes shoot at the same target" game. The mechanics exist in game to create solid support characters, but there's NO value to it for a player to do so.
---
I believe that greater effort should be put into balancing classes of weapons and skills so that builds are viable, and we get away from this "meta with infinite skill choices" stuff we have going on now.
---
What gets me is that one guy running around with a cash register over his head the whole time.
---
Now that the Sentinel/Cavalier thing is chance-based, it's more fun now.  You can't be on autopilot.  Some things, like Mirelurk Kings, Super Mutants with Miniguns, and Colonel Gutsys are still a problem.  You can always make it more difficult on yourself.  I chose to use a boxing glove as my main, which isn't the strongest weapon, but funny.  My character also rarely wears underarmor, so that's another "rule" I have.
---
I'd have no objection to them re-balancing certain enemies.  The max level Deathclaws, in particular, should be comparable in HP to the Sheepsquatch.
---
I tried the option to disable the computer/robots and make the animal subjects aggressive.  Never again.  We had a level 2 death bear and it ran right up to a level 100 Sheepsquatch to attack and took two hits and we immediately failed.  BAD design, there can't be anything gained by disabling the computer.
---
It has, by definition, extreme range, multi-pellet damage to get through one-shot protection, and extreme damage output. You can certainly OHKO most people with it if you score a proper hit.
---
I think they‚Äôre able to do it and have already made adjustments so that the weapons function differently when PVPing. A few patches ago some PVPers complained that they couldn‚Äôt one-shot new players any more but got one or two shot by very low level players. Apparently Bethesda didn‚Äôt suddenly jack up low level pipe gun‚Äôs damage, they were adjusted to function better when PVPing. Similar tweak can certainly be done to lasers.
---
You can already do that by logging off suddenly when people in camp, standing above a very high cliff :DD
---
Generally most people in game are pretty decent. It‚Äôs fun dropping off a few resources to new players and things like that. Even had a lvl 100+ in my camp who saw me and used the ‚Äúdying of thirst‚Äù emote so I grabbed the water from my two purifiers and dropped it for them to have. They just gave hearts and then dropped a few stimpacks as thanks. When I was doing the tea time event a higher level player dropped by and dropped me an an Explosive smg to use instead of my 10mm and we just blew everything up as a laugh. Even down to dropping off a set of raider power armour for a lvl 15 who was near grafton. People are appreciative of little things.
---
Cryolater?  Going to try my two shot one and see if it keeps the Alpha slow enough to not be as threatening.
---
Leather arms and legs (33dr\*4 77er\*4 ) + CA chest or Marine chest seem 2 be max for dr+er combinations, r8? Currently seekin 4 info on all combinations
---
It's a specially crafted stimpack that heals your team.
---
How do you give them away?  Mine will not let me drop, trade, or sell.  Doesn't even appear as an option.
---
Yea option to change build from melee to rifle to gunslinger can help in player retention especially when nerfs pop out the woodwork randomly.
---
In my opinion, it's an RPG PvP system and it should definitely cater towards the more flushed out builds. Biggest argument I see right now is that people can't beat someone with better gear or better build(which isn't true you can still manage it) an think that builds and weapons should mean nothing, we should all drop just as quick. Which isn't really a good solution, a lot of things need tweaking and nerfing/buffing however the general consensus is someone should be able to pick up the game today and enjoy PvP against someone who's been playing since beta. Until a mode with new characters and balance is implemented, which I'm highly for no one is going to be happy because following a build is to hard for a lot of people.
---
Alrighty, thanks. That is super helpful. =D
---
How much does it influence the folks who are heavy into pvp and how many does it affect.  if ti is not a substantial number, and I suspect it is not, then I doubt it will be addressed give those weapons don't drop now.  Having said that I like you idea about beam weapons have an incendiary damage bonus in place of explosive.  That should something BGS does as it takes steps to refine the game.
---
Based on responses here, maybe I don't play enough. The longest session I have had is ~8 hours. However, my average on a weekend with free time is a 4 hour session. During the week I play 2 hours max per session.
---
PS4 Pro, though unsure if the "pro" has anything to do with it.
---
Game is installed on external WD drive, non SSD
---
Internet connection speed averages about 50Mbps.
---
PS4 is on wi-fi
---
Depends what you want really. Would you prefer a view, a fancy build or resources?
---
I'm not an expert on this and havent even gotten myself good legendary rolls yet. But I go Handmade and lever action behind it.
---
That was the best quest I ever failed. I went in, no clue, got beaten to hell and back but somehow managed to never die. Broke my primary weapon and two pieces of armor. Despite failing, stumbled out with 6 new legendaries, one of them a three star. Might go back if there's more than a single level 57 in there with me.
---
If you have a problem, offer a solution instead of a complaint.
---
I have that rank lol I just want the clean us flag
---
...complain on reddit about how trash the game is, and how we need more content on a steady, fast-set drip feed to keep those few people happy.
---
...most likely.
---
The place has wood and some junk in the shed. The view is meh and I‚Äôd like a cool build but got no ideas. I want to turn the playground into a fort
---
Would kill for 10mm Bloodied Exp Vats related perk but thats just a pipe dream.
---
Please keep selling those serums at 350 or less... easy money for me to flip to a vendor for twice that.
---
Look for the Panic emotes, LOL.
---
I carry three backpacks and hot swap between the three: armored, refrigerated, and high-capacity. The high-capacity lets me fast travel away with all the loot I've secured, back to a train station to sell, scrap, and scrip.
---
Yup there's even a player run community of cannibals known as EATT (Establishment of Appalachian Taste Testers).
---
Ahh!! It's a sphere not a dome!!! Of course it is. Thanks for mentioning this.
---
Your solution is perfect.   Pareto optimal, even.  It does not diminish the overall ‚Äúfun‚Äù of legacy weapons but lets PVPers agree on how they should be balanced.    Having different prefix impact between Survival and Adventure would allow Bethesda to keep both camps happy without major coding changes.  It‚Äôs brilliant.  And needs visibility.
---
That is exactly what I said not to do. Streamline the game.  
---
Why was Fallout 4's perk system shit compared to past installments? Streamlining.   
---
Why is WoW dead? Streamlining.   
---
The weight of your choices should be a pain in the ass. Why run a rogue in D&amp;D if ANYONE and EVERYONE can lockpick doors? I hate switching my perk cards for terminals and locks too; however, when I group with someone who has lock picking incorporated in their main build, I become overjoyed. When one person build a completely functional utility build while I focused combat, and we each have our separate roles when in a team, I praise the uniqueness. I still am happy that when I am solo, I have the option to take a small amount of my time to change my build to cater to utility so I am not hindered in progression for choosing to play solo; most games would make you pick one or the other. So its more  or less be happy with what we have, or keep demanding changes that will ruin the whole thing.
---
I sell everything and it all sells, somedays slowly and somedays not at all but eventually.
---
To be a little more specific, it diffuses stimpacks
---
Yep, this. Nobody has them to sell because the chance of getting any is slim to start with. From what I've read the diffuser only comes in to the loot roll if all 3 animals live.
---
You have a link for this?
---
I can find mention of Vault 76, easily, but nothing on Appalachia itself, or the state of things there.
---
Tactics and BOS are not canon and Van Buren was cancelled, so I don't trust those as legitimate sources of lore.
---
The metas are easy to follow, and give you a significant advantage, people just need to accept how the PvP is played as of now instead of creating made up personal rules others have to follow for it to be a fair fight.
---
(Sorry for replying to your comment twice you can just reply to the other just figured I'd add this, actually do appreciate a more logical conversation around PvP though just wanted to say that, I get where you coming from with a lot of it and can understand the frustration from some, but a lot can be alleviated by doing a little research, issue is that  there really isn't a lot for people to search up and learn about the game more in depth)
---
I have an explosive SMG, and maybe it's my build and the fact I'm not optimized for it, but it's pretty much trash.  As a comparison, I can one hit kill lvl 62 feral ghouls in melee - sneaking or not (not that this is anything amazing, just a point of reference), and the same ghouls will absorb 2/3 of a drum magazine (IIRC, ~50 rounds) before dropping.
---
Cool build! I'm on ps4 unfortunately:(. Thanks for the advice and showing me!
---
I just watched that video yesterday. That mans a genius.
---
the arktos lab coat is pretty cool. Mostly white but has some green around it, goes very well with the backpack. You can also get the bear claw plan
---
‚ÄúThey‚Äù say combat dense mods back at Watoga as of two weeks ago.
---
I built on that tower long ago, and stayed there for a very long time. Great location. 
---
Nowhere near this level though. Just campfire glitched a foundation and roof at the top and lived in that tower-top shack.
---
Those duplicated keys bother me every time I go through the inventory....
---
Np, it's nowhere near perfect but have fun!
---
How about walls that:
---
-Dont require the lower wall to be placed the same way
---
- can be placed on ceilings without a wall below
---
I'm really considering this too. My camp was in a nice location near Sutton station and Helvetica. It was great for Fasnacht Day. Now it's down near Charleston station which is better because when my partner and I game together (which is most of the time) we have a camp North and South. I like to be near a station but not right in the middle of somewhere. I kind of want to move again but it's just so much hassle haha.
---
A lever action is nice and it uses different ammo than the handmade. Try finding one with antiarmor.
---
Man I miss the crap everything mod from 4. So many clean camps.
---
And that dawning horror of using /scrapall for the first time with this mod enabled.
---
"That in strange aeons, even Death may die?'
---
yeah, annoying in arktos pharma, really want a backpack skin, but so many just wanna fight the alpha and come and stay in one room. I dont get it, you can just run to west tek or something and find a 3\* star in under 5mins which is easy kill
---
Yeah plus I‚Äôve got vending machine that‚Äôll need redoing.
---
Game has been unstable since BETA and not much improvements since then. I don't expect that this game will be more stable anymore. Bethesda is already focusing to create new cheap and buggy games. They don't spend much resources anymore to this project.
---
maybe they have tinnitis, and the white noise helps them sleep.
---
They do nothing but follow you for aesthetic purposes. No damage, no carrying. Just a companion.
---
I really hate taking damage from invisible enemies. 
---
Like if the game isn't fully loaded then don't let us walk around like the game is loaded...
---
I can‚Äôt even find the basement. Where are the stairs to it??
---
As long as it's not super steep you should be fine.
---
True
---
From my observations nearly 100% of top tier PvP players now use explosive lasers. Its just my observations and these are limited, but from the people who play similar timezones as me I already recognise most of the nicknames of dangerous guys and within last three weeks everybody very good gathered one.
---
The one problem is location I won‚Äôt be going out of my way to a shop where I‚Äôm not intending to go
---
Same problem
---
It's an elevator right inside the main entrance/lobby area
---
Pagodas.  
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoda#/media/File:Horyu-ji09s3200.jpg
---
They should offer no advantage or disadvantage's at all. Just a cosmetic friend.
---
I'd rather keep the system I have now, or lock out perk choices, than loadouts or passive perks too. But, the complaints about perk changes are daily. If the crying isn't stopped, they are going to fix what is not broken and I'd rather suggest something that doesn't completely neuter the game over something that would absolutely kill character uniqueness (I'm going to remove it as a suggestion because you are absolutely right).  
---
Look at my comment/response where I mention having a rogue in D&amp;D. It should clear this up. I don't want a God character, I don't want a character than can absolutely do everything.
---
I personally dont see specifically lockpick and hacking being passive as a game breaking change lol. I wouldn't want harvesting, weight saving, or generally any other non combat perks as passives. As they do have a drastic effect on one's gameplay. However, in a game like 76 where junkiness is next to godliness, I see having to spend 6 levels to get those perks alone as enough of a time investment. Though we can agree to disagree I suppose.
---
and more graphical options too, I want to turn off shadows...
---
Yeah fourth time now for me. Gonna do something else for a while then.
---
[Not always near something](https://youtu.be/xR2YSNQQrTY?t=936)
---
Thanks, Bethesda has improved the game tremendously by listening to players‚Äô feedbacks and suggestions, sure hope they will make fine adjustments next instead of carpet nerfing üëçüèª
---
I could play around with the values a bit more if it's possible.
---
I think the problem is the event rewards suck if you dont get a large enough group to feed the objectives
---
And don't forget super duper!
---
Thanks. I‚Äôll check it out.
---
A second camp would be too much I think but an increase would be cool.
---
You need one for the big guys, i use a BE handmade for short-mid, BE lever action for long and BE Dragon for the big guys (2500dmg x2.5 from stealth) 
---
Only problem is that the Dragon takes 2 weeks to reaload....
---
Everyone should know this.
---
Yep, you're the reason I only sell 10-15 Stimpacks a time, at 4-6 caps. I don't blame you, that's the game, but not my way of playing it!
---
We do hear of negative interactions but in my experience they are very rare (I mostly hear about them then experience them). Even the dreaded playing an event and some one comes and one hits the legendary boss (I have been lucky enough not to have that happen yet). Which honestly could be some one not thinking rather than actively trying to be an asshole.   
---
What is more odd is we also in general hear many people talk about how nice the community is. Go to GTA... you won't hear anyone say that about GTA's community. At best you'll hear people defend teh griefers saying it's part of the game and git good. I would say the reputation overall for the community on 76 is that it is pretty decent. And you don't hear that often about MP games (usually if you hear comments on the community of some game it's cause people are talking how toxic it is).
---
And just like sentry bots, you run behind them, shoot the fusion core, and not so scary anymore.
---
I just used it as an example as you were following geniune shitty requests and i wasnt gonna go theough trawling too many pages to get them, hense the disclaimer that i know yours was a joke
---
Well, you either design for pve or pvp. Fallout 76 is inherently a pve focused game. And that‚Äôs totally fine. But its incredibly imbalanced for pvp. Builds don‚Äôt mean anything in pvp if they‚Äôre not one of several pretty specific specs that happen to be super OP. It makes sense that people are unhappy with it, particularly with all the duping that went on that enabled so many people to max out so fast. 
---
Regardless of whether or not you can manage without a perfect setup, it‚Äôs still broke as hell. Pvp will always be imbalanced as long as pve is the main focus, which it probably always will be. But right now, even with recent changes, I‚Äôd say it needs a lot of work before it‚Äôs passable. Hell, the pve isn‚Äôt even particularly balanced. Obviously some people want everything to go their way, and we can ignore them, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of valid criticism to be made here.
---
Had a guy write out paragraphs on xbox one because my "prices are ignorant" and "shameful towards promoting a healthy trading environment for other players". I told him if he doesn't want to buy, don't buy. I've had 15-20 sales so far. People will pay for what they want. He then wrote more paragraphs telling me I should lower items that he coincidentally was asking for by x amount of caps.
---
I had to block him because he continued to call me ignorant.
---
Now my camp states that my prices are ignorant because you know, JUST IN CASE.
---
I‚Äôd settle for them not disappearing...
---
Can we at least get separate containers? I hate the idea that every container is a stash instead of a separate storage.
---
&gt; My only entitlement is that I purchased a Fallout game with a vision  from Bethesda, a vision that I liked and believed in, and I'm only  encouraging that they stick to their vision. 
---
No, you're not.  You are insisting that they adopt your vision, which is, broadly speaking, fewer QoL improvements, more benefits for the hardcore.
---
Bethesda is a professional developer.  They wear big boy pants.  They can figure out, for themselves, what to keep and what to reject.  When to bend and when to hold still.  They don't need a white knight defending their vision (or one assuming he knows what that "vision" is).
---
Any creative person would tell you the same thing: All feedback is valuable, but not all feedback requires action.  As the artist, you are the one who must determine what is or isn't important to *you*.
---
TLDR: They don't need your help.
---
Good summary.  But prices are all over the board. Saw a perfectly preserved pie for $25,000 caps in one camp and $25 in another. Same price difference with a bottle of nuka cola quantum. Guess I shopped......   :)
---
And if the solution isn't accepted, take your resources and find a place that meets your requirements. Never try to force a square peg in a round hole when you could more easily find a square hole.
---
I move my CAMPs all the time... I'm always looking for a "better" place. 
---
"Better" (to *me* ) means something more flavourful and "in character" for the character. Not always "is there a resource nearby".
---
I'd love to build near water.. but that more often than not results in "your CAMP cannot be placed, would you like to move to another world or attempt to move it for free, which really means you're gonna have to tear it down and rebuild anyways due to issues with whatever terrain exists in your new location".
---
Two of my characters have there for "forever homes" now... one has a super mobile CAMP that consists of a tent, stash box, sleeping bag, cooking station only. And the last character?
---
 I am still on the hunt.
---
Amen on your idea of survival mode too. I think an easy change in the right direction for it would be to allow us to keep a stash of protected loot, but allow us to craft other stash boxes that can be raided and stolen. It drives me nuts they went with a leaderboard aspect of PvP rather than a raid/reward system, especially in a game with as good as base building as this game. Give me a reason to take a Fat Man to someone's base that doesn't involve just doing it to troll.
---
You could just msg them
---
The reason could be that Bethesda has promised so much during FO76 release and delivers pretty much nothing. Game is still in BETA when it comes to bugs, glitches etc. They created a big hype and expectations with big money and delivered only garbage for people.
---
Update! They did maintenance last night it should work now!
---
NB4 it gets ‚Äúfixed‚Äù
---
I thought the bug was .50 being weaker than hardened .308?
---
I know they made a post abou fixing that bug, but I don't remember if they addressed the issue of it being stronger than the other .50 receivers.
---
Agreed. The legendary drop from the "boss" is nice and all, but I fiend more for the recipes and rare outfits. Better chance of those with more animals kept alive.
---
Better then my reward, my is nothing since I auto crash upon entering lol.
---
Top of the world has a concrete extractor and water. That is literally the best spot I ever found.... still got bored and moved
---
Bug reports fair enough, i dont know how to code, i assume most people dont either, so i dont expect a solution to be offered for them, but theres no reason to fly off the rails to report it
---
may not be your thing but my weapon of choice for bosfights is a plasmaflamer wich benefits from rifleman perks
---
i do have a vampire version wich is insane as it makes you basically invincible as long as you shoot and with 300 mag capacity you can shoot all day 
---
the damage output is very good id think a ffr ts or furious version would be awesome damagewise however the vampire effect benefits the weapon perfect in boss fights
---
the obly drawback is the ammo consumption i dont really struggle too much but im not into farming the sbq or anything i just run into harder bosses every once in a while when im doing an event or something
---
Do you  play PS4? I swear I saw some one who made their character look just like Preston during one of the sheepsquatch events. 
---
While I was minutemen in 4, I like the responders better. BEtter clothes too (I like the more harking to medical personal then the historic clothes of the minutemen).
---
Hahahaha, the true end game right there.   
---
A problem that every mmo has, but no survival game does.
---
Indeed they are, melee also doesn‚Äôt consume ammo, so there‚Äôs that too.
---
When you refer to one shot meta... do you mean explosive laser rifles? Are they one shotting / better dps on SBQ than anything else? Can you give me approximate kill times on SBQ?
---
I got a spare cam if you want it. Gt LtT4Z
---
Can you do that without sending a friend request first?
---
I have failed to get loot and shot the boss.  Even watched it do damage.  This does make me just go play something else.
---
I have the worst luck whenever I‚Äôm doing the event. I always go when there‚Äôs a lot of people thinking it‚Äôll be easier to complete. But no, there could be 6 people there, but only 2 are helping fill the machines, whilst the other 4 just shooting random enemies. Then there‚Äôs no surprise when only Barry, the friendly bloatfly shows up and gets killed almost instantly failing the event.
---
Yes, they already fixed it, .50 now is higher than .308
---
I'll look for that comment, but getting ahead of it... I maintain, to this day, that the "rogue" that replaced the "thief" in roleplaying games... ruined RPGs.
---
Do I need to pay you?
---
This explains what happened to me and a group of randoms 2 months ago in Watoga. Ghouls just kept spawning in the same spot 4 at a time once every minute and a 3* would spawn once every 5 minutes. We sat there for 2 hours farming 3* ghouls.
---
Yeah I did it all the time for looking at 3 star weapons at vendors before they fixed that
---
Perhaps, but if they‚Äôre bad base weapons then people would regret/avoid learning the plans, which would get silly.
---
maybe.  who knows?
---
Honetly i feel like they have delivered on whatvthey promised when it was announced, i dont know what people expected otherwise but the game is as advertised, yes its buggy but anyone whos ever played a bethesda game knows that you can expect some bugs, the memories of FO3 for me are mostly of stretched corpses flying through the sky at mach 3
---
the refined 50. cal reciever is at the top for damage, at 149. the rest fall short of the mark,may as well use the 308 at 139. mine has a recon scope,so falls short on range.
---
really good on ranged sniper attacks,but again the 308 excells.can't carry both so the .50 is in favour at the moment. gauss (224)  sucks on accuracy,but for medium range and aimed,not vats,not shabby. all got god awful reload times. I wish for a semi auto sniper,with a 15/20 round capacity, and, 149 damage. (won't get, but can wish for).
---
Does it? I've let it run for over an hour before and it was still counting up Shotgun Shells. Maybe you hit it sooner with some of the others?
---
I dont need 2 camps... but I would love to have like 5 difrent locations with builds saved and before entering the game I would select wich I would like to load... I love building and I afraid of destroying my camp in order to try a new thing...
---
I fucking love this. Well done!
---
I am on PC and no, Ashton does not look like Preston.
---
Oh I know, I do the event daily. I go there to farm the same things. Its just frustrating when you only walk away with 1 or 2 instead 3 but oh well.
---
Is luck lvl a factor?
---
If you hit the fusion core it should explode like a vehicle.  Just make it hard to do.  Cant lock on with V.A.T.S
---
Invite a bunch of higher-level people from the map.  If they're not too busy, just kind of bumming around the map with nothing to do, you inviting them might prompt them to pull up their map to see why you're inviting them.  It's still a little awkward when everybody goes their separate ways afterwards, but well worth doing events right.
---
For example bloodied builds that one shot almost everything in PVE and PVP, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for the SBQ, but everything else is one or two shots, that‚Äôs what my friend does all the time.
---
He uses explosive + mutation + low health, you know, meta stuff.
---
Agree to disagree.   
---
I was just trying to stress the uniqueness between each of our characters. They provide a system for us, with a minor inconvenience for solo players, that allows us to essentially do everything while still feeling unique from each other. Making anything passive just brings my character build that much closer to yours, and it only but starts with lock picking and hacking.
---
It doesn't seem to be a broken mechanic necessarily, but I guess you never know. The legendary spawn rate doesn't seem to be different from White Springs or WestTek.  The event is designed to continue to spawn mobs until you kill the boss, and playing it as a high level player just triggers the game to spawn high level enemies.
---
As someone who got the high capacity mod legit, I do NOT feel cheated.
---
I would wager mkney that guy has never worked in retail but is routinely one of "those" customers that belives if they complain enough theyll get what they want
---
Nope. Freebe
---
Nah apparently if you never got the initiate paint drop, you can't get any of them anymore
---
How?
---
I know what you meqn that would be a great option.
---
Thanks, I added you and I am joining you now
---
Been doing this since i saw this video a few days ago. Worth it.
---
Also the plan for the stimpack dispenser which you need for the medical challenge. I've done it a bunch of times and never got anything more than the lab coat though. Either no one comes and I have to do it alone or some lvl 10 guy starts it and fucks it all up.
---
So you have to finish more tadpole challenges
---
If Bethesda's trademark is to deliver buggy games it won't help in the future either if people just think that it is normal. It affects to whole game industry if people accept garbage production quality.
---
I'm blaming the party responsible for the problems
---
Agreed. Keep the 'boss' concept, just don't make it legendary.
---
Any potential legendary drops add them to the event (successful) completion reward pool.
---
The better the overall performance the higher the chance of legendary reward.
---
Every single event since fasnacht seems to have a legendary enemy at the 'end' and the whole 'failing the objective(s) because everyone is concerned with tagging it' is getting old fast.
---
If this was a social experiment I think it has run its course now, time for a change.
---
There's several posts requesting this already.
---
Sure, that'll be 1200 atoms each
---
dat divine tho
---
Exactly what I have been saying this entire post. This is not a single-player Fallout experience. It shouldn't be, at all, and the idea of this post was to tell Bethesda through all the complains and bullshit not to make it a single-player experience.   
---
I don't want my character to be exactly like yours with just a different face.
---
I'm on the jumk pile around there and I get loads of traffic, Graham's route also goes right through my camp so I get traffic for that too.
---
I agree - the SBQ &amp; imposter are different in that the whole point of the event is to kill them (and it ain't easy). I've been to a few SBQ events where we failed because nobody was doing significant damage to it, instead focusing on all the mobs. The point of the event is to kill the queen!  But in the other events where we have to shepherd cows or tame animals or corpse flowers then players need to focus on that.
---
thank you, sometimes we do something in italy too!
---
I might put some balconies for the vacant rooms and maybe the penthouse but I am pushing the build limit very far here. I think I have like 5% room left.
---
I have the mod on xb1
---
I bought arktos lab coat from player vendor for 35 capsüòã And get bearclaw by itself as a reward (looks and sounds nice), but it's useless if not legendary.
---
What do you want for it?
---
they are called Cap Sinks, some players with full caps actually request them to clean up caps so they dont go over
---
I get his all the time without speed demon. I get it all the time without even sprinting. Just casually walking into a new area, the environment loads so slow I frequently walk through walls and get attacked by mobs of enemies that haven‚Äôt loaded yet.
---
I simply use it as a term rather than a role with context behind it.
---
People who are within range of their teammates when their teammates get XP for a kill should also get the XP and get to loot the corpse also, just like every other party based game on earth. But Bethesda are a bunch of idiots.
---
You have the same chance regardless of item level, save yourself the screws, always craft the lowest level. 
---
Don't forget to equip Super Duper before crafting
---
Im not saying dont bring up the bugs, they are fixing them, just not to do it in such a shitey way.  
---
Thats what i mean when i said these posts are all valid complaints but they come across ass-holey in the way they say them
---
The metas are easy to follow, and it‚Äôs not hard to find someone to sell you duped gear for cheap... but why?
---
Why would anybody waste their time getting set up for bad pvp? If I need to get the same setup that everybody else uses just to feel like I‚Äôm not gimping myself, what‚Äôs the point? That sounds super boring and pointless. I‚Äôll go play a good pvp game where my choices matter. Fortnite pvp would be preferable to this, and that‚Äôs saying something. 
---
And that‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôve been trying to get at here. The pvp is obviously functional. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not broken as hell too. Wouldn‚Äôt you rather the pvp was better than it is? Like way better?
---
Oooooh! I always ignore those horde events, much thanks!
---
Shit, you're right. I guess it must have come from the enemies on the surface. Honestly I just mash the collect button on every corpse and don't bother paying attention to what I'm picking up  until I'm home or over encumbered.
---
I sell my junk regularly every evening but i do not sell it bulked
---
non bulked aluminium and adhesive for 3c each
---
black titanium for 4c each
---
balistic fiber and screws 5c each
---
ultracite for 6c each
---
Highest offer is for 2k at the moment.
---
last time i did this, i'm playing instruments and everyone else ran outside to where the mobs spawn from and killed everything before they even got to the building. i looted zero.
---
Much more difficult if you're the only one guarding the friendly animal in Habitat B and the Alpha Boss Lvl 100 Legendary is in Habitat C. You leave to throw your molotov and something kills your friendly.
---
I will never understand the rush to endgame (and as a result... "rush to boredom") that some players do.
---
I have an unsettling number of hours into ESO. Like... an embarrassing amount that no adult should be proud of, I have STILL not entered Cyrodiil to this day. I have "finished" the main questline with one character, have not yet done the secondary "see the world though the enemy's eyes" playthrough.
---
I don't play for META builds, I don't grind for power. I peek in every corner and try every build and hunt for every easter egg and secret. I love to see if oddball builds are viable in PvE, I want to try everything the game has to offer. 
---
I know I'm not the only one... but I also know that I am in the minority. But I can say this... I don't get bored in games, unless the game itself is "boring" at it's core. 
---
Beth now has survival mode... which is great for the Pvp Power Gamers, and I hope they continue to develop it for them. Adventure mode is where it's at for me, as of right now. But I do long for a true, deep survival mode that isn't focused on power gaming and PvP. One that rewards characterful play.
---
Ah yes! White PA with a little rust here and there. Another great one that I hope returns someday. I wish there was justification lore-wise to import the Institute clean white scheme as well.
---
 Not that I can find. Several people have said this, I think they are mistaken.
---
cosmetic companion (bot/dog) that just follow you around and can not die...

My bloodied heavy weapons build guide:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the\_bloodied\_heavy\_weapons\_tank\_an\_end\_game\_pve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/) 
---
This wrecks SBQ in 2-3 minutes, even when carrying lots of randoms that aren't contributing meaningful damage. This is the highest dps build in the game to my knowledge. I can link a video with multiple SBQ kills if people want to argue about it, and unless you show me video proof that their build is faster, I'm going to call BS (someone always wants to argue that rifles or melee is better).
---
This.  Levers are cost effective.
---
Totally agree but I would add that if you've been active in the event you should be able to loot all enemies. I've recently started using a Tesla rifle when there's a lot of mobs because it arcs from one enemy to another so I can tag all of them.
---
Same here (PC) I thought I hit the jackpot with a legendary sheepsquatch, deathclaw, and super mutant in a single pile but nothing I photograph is giving me credit.
---
Same here, the ammo that sells best for me is 5.56 and shotgun shells.  I usually put up 100 each tme for 1c/each.  Haven't sold a single ultracite round yet though but I am charging 3c each and I only have .308 and .44 in ultracite
---
I would agree.  But absolutely don't let someone who stands around, or hides, and actually contributes NOTHING to an event get ANYTHING.
---
Na I only look forward to the guaranteed 3* monster at the end.
---
I usually buy plans, ammo, some junk, and MAYBE some weapons or armor
---
But wouldn‚Äôt that not make sense in the canon since the scorched plague is airborne and the Helmet filters everything and they can‚Äôt be Gould either bc of the rad protection. Maybe like broken armor or raider would make since. I really like your idea though it could be like a lost raider clan or bos squad that you come across
---
I made a post about them being missing and was roundly criticized by various folks saying they‚Äôd seen them.
---
I used to ONLY do them if they were in the Mire or Bog, as those were the only ones with some chance at max level gear. Then I started doing most all of them once "scrip" became a thing. Now knowing this, I'll never miss one again!
---
‚ÄúDoors locked? Hmm maybe I can get a peak through the window... or if I jump on this ridge..or... 
---
... oh. Well that‚Äôs depressing. I shouldn‚Äôt have looked...‚Äù lol
---
Floating bases are aesthetic abominations.
---
That is all.
---
Imagine critiquing wasteland survival camps lmao. Get outta here.
---
I do see this as being clunky-by-design though, to deliberately stall the player so they can't ~~lockpick~~ picklock their way out of danger.  Same with predefined loadouts, imo.  If a player could switch, on a dime, between heavy weapon perks and shotgun perks, that kind of erodes the mechanic of being stuck with the decisions we made, if only for a moment.  If I die because I forgot to swap Hard Bargain with Lone Wanderer, that's on me.  I'm fine with that. üòã
---
Is it the best way to do it?  Probably not.  They should give us the option to sort the cards better.  Maybe by most used, or allow us to hide the ones we don't.  I'm not fond of the whole Base/Expert/Master nomenclature not being conducive to alphabetization, whereas Heavy Gunner I, II and III would have been.
---
That goes back to our original conversation, because "Two-Shot" is what "the magic" would be. Theseus's Paradox really only applies to Weight Reduction weapons and Weightless armor and the mods we use on them. You are correct though, if we applied the black and white version of Bethesda's answer to it to all aspects of the game  any legendaries you mod would no longer be that legendary. I 100% agree that it's dumb how they pick and choose such arbitrary weights and what is or isn't effective through weight management perks. I'm just trying to help people understand why mods specifically are unaffected by weight reduction perks.
---
Ah ok, I thought you meant there was a new meta that I wasn't aware of. I don't care too much about one shotting regular enemies in pvp. To get to that level of damage, you have to sit at 19% HP, so it's risk vs. reward, which I think is fine. 
---
In PvP I flat out don't like the current meta at all. The time to kill in PvP is so fast, especially with broken explosive laser rifles, that I just don't see a point to it at all. There is no skill, no strategy - whoever gets off the first shot wins.
---
Playing it with all players muted
---
Is it 2k or 6k?? You said not 10 hours ago it was 6 but I don‚Äôt see any over 1k..
---
I'm a big fan of the Tesla rifle - non-auto version for a rifle build.  Tagging higher level legendaries, dealing with trash mobs, insect swarms, etc.  Since there's no rifle reduction weight perks, having a few pieces of weapon weight reduction legendary armor helps too.  Short (Handmade), mid (Lever Action), long/opener (Gauss/Dragon), and crowd control (Tesla) should provide the rifle variety for all situations.
---
Do you do this in Arktos when you're protecting a friendly in a habitat that's different from where the lvl 100 boss is?
---
What do you mean by that question?
---
Lol. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúc‚Äômon man. You‚Äôre not even trying.‚Äù
---
I sell most things for about the same as I‚Äôd get for selling it to a robot vendor.  So, 500 for a serum, 6 for a diluted stimpack, etc. Way cheaper than it would be for someone to buy from a vendorbot, and same result for me. Main exception is stable fluxes which I price somewhat higher depending on whether I‚Äôve got a lot of a particular flux.
---
Cap loss was supposed to equal your level max of 50 caps after patch 8. Butvya its bugged and back at a 1/4 cap level
---
Flames, right? Was it in the Atom Shop? Crap. I missed it the first time around. Hopefully it‚Äôll appear again.
---
That it  "Just works" :D
---
This is also a good tip! Least regardless of the level range you more than likely get something you want. I need to grind some scrip anyway lol
---
Cross post bids. 6k guy backed out.
---
I hope they finally fix that music challenge so I can knock it out.
---
Like fast traveling is immersing enough hahahaha
---
I see, not really experienced at PVP, but to be completely honest I don‚Äôt really see the risk he‚Äôs taking, he just drops entire mobs while I reload, it‚Äôs ridiculous imo.
---
The lab coat isnt rare, i tossed away over 10 lol the stimlak diffuser is the rarest thing you can get from this event.
---
Lol oh boy, we have a fast travel snob here!
---
on the flipside tho, we also complain when, e.g. people go to the SBQ battle and hide in the bunker, they get the Event loot and do nothing. 
---
so clearing mobs during an event needs to be scored differently than normal enemies, and balanced better with damage done to the apex predator in the event. this will likely mean fairly big changes to the scoring system for events.
---
That would be really interesting to see. Also the Outcast BOS armor would be neat to have again.
---
Adventure mode is the way it is because of people like you who complain about everything well sorry the game cant be made to you
---
I see it as the period in Role Playing games when the shift began from "let's tell a story" to "Let's roll dice and kill shit on a tabletop".
---
We went from "sneaky, fragile, potentially high damage lockpicking" to "Cuisinart that out damages everyone, and can also pick locks".
---
There was period in the late 80s and early 90s where the while genre took a shift... and it parallels the boom in CRPGs. The late period rogue of AD&amp;D 1,756th &amp; 7/8 edition is garbage.
---
This happened with me too...
---
Thiswhy I asked if the price we set is for the bulk, or for eatch. 1000ish 10mm ammo went down the drain aswell. Still have a lot of them, so...
---
the holo tapes with spooky stories and cryptids.
---
As much as I would love a camp increase, stability needs to be the priority. The last 2 patches have made lag, latency, and loading times horrible.
---
I've been at 100% budget for months, I have to scrap 1 item to add 1 item. It's been excruciating trying to decide what to remove, to add each new mounted head.
---
Confirmed not working for ash heap either (PC)
---
I find myself paying more attention to notes and terminals more too! Some great stories to find
---
Honestly I think I‚Äôd much prefer this, opposed to having individual fixed camps. Build a Camp in an area, ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù it and it holds the co-ordinates of where the Camp was built as well as the design. 
---
Boom, multiple camps but only one at a time. 
---
Gives me more opportunities to build, without having to destroy my shop. 
---
Beautiful.
---
So there IS growing subreddit dedicated to the art of C.A.M.P. design...mind you
---
do one really get 6 caps for a diluted stimpaks... did not know this
---
Using weight reduction perks would make it less efficient as it‚Äôs another check and calculation to perform in the database and item weights. 
---
As it is now. You open your stash. It loads all items. 
---
You have a ‚Äúreduce weapon weight perk‚Äù for weapons in stash. You now have to iterate through the items, gathering a list of all weapons, calculate their weights and generate a new sum. 
---
Seems trivial. It might be. Can‚Äôt say for certain without knowing the architecture. 
---
Point is that adding stuff like this adds to computation and performance.
---
Turrets
---
You‚Äôre the one taking shots at people for having crappy settings , tbh some people won‚Äôt have either the plans or the time , nor the creative input.
---
No need to demonize their efforts , before tossing a rock see where you‚Äôre standing yourself....
---
That‚Äôs one of the most creative camps I‚Äôve seen so far!
---
We've mentioned it before but will pass it along again. Thanks!
---
I remember seeing these requests even back when the game first came out. This would be such a nice QoL change.
---
No, I am saying that they stick to their vision, the vision they talked about long before you pushed for this game to be Fallout 4 with friends. I know what Bethesda said, and what they want, because they told us at E3 and Bethesda Days in Boston what they want and what their vision is.   
---
They also said, at Bethesda Days (if you went, you'd know) that they listen heavily to this reddit to help shape their game for us with their vision, and this reddit has been filled with your popular opinion. The popular opinion that contradicts exactly what they said their plan and vision for the game was. The other half of the popular opinion has been quite, because we trust they won't change their promised vision for you.  
---
Now, I see so many posts that work against what they have said they want this game to be, and they have already made changes to the game that oppose what they said their vision for the game was. I am simply trying to remind them that yes, they don't have to cater to your entitlement and demands because they wear the big boy pants.   
---
As I said, my only true opinion is on survival mode changes, WHICH (again, if you actually followed their PR) you'd know that they want community feedback to sculpt it correct. Hell. Todd Howard said that himself in Boston.   
---
So, please, don't get salty that I am sharing my damn opinion after six month of you sharing your opinions that have pushed them away from the game they told us they wanted to give us and the vision they had for the game.
---
I keep hearing about backpack skins but I‚Äôve never seen a backpack. Are they functional or just cosmetic?
---
No most people wouldn't join the event if there was no legendary boss.  All they need to do is tie the rewards to the event success. If the event fails, the boss should disappear.  Tie the number of stars the boss has to the number of friendly animals still alive.  Stuff like that, the event rewards are already tied to the success of the event, so should the boss.
---
Lots of BOS Knights ran around in PA without their helmet. I just figured they didn't retain the mental capacity required to operate it.
---
Bloodied is the best build for dps by far, but it's also a big drawback to have to micromanage your HP so much. Is it worth it? In my opinion 100% yes, but most players don't run it because they're too lazy or don't realize the potential. I had a hell of a time convincing my friend to run it, even after he saw me melting SBQ in 2-3 minutes consistently and one shotting mobs.
---
IMO, this is the only way to go for a pve player: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/

Does this flag you as waned after doing it?

Yeah it seems to randomly select your permitted spawn point. So one time my one permitted spawn point was a glitched out event notification, where if you click on it it asks you if you want to spend x caps to fast travel and then nothing happens. Two glitches conspiring to force me to quit the server and lose all the junk I'm carrying, nice.

Just because they are in PA doesnt mean they never had their helmets off.  They could have been hit by the scorch disease then ran over to their armor and jumped in to go fight.  There is a story for everything.  Like us...we are hanging in our Camp, SB flies by and cropdusts you.  You then don your PA and go fight.
---
Yeah that would be a really cool addition
---
Not on bosses. Bosses usually require more than just a tag currently. That's why a lot of people have made the same complaint about SBQ because they roll up with their lvl 15 pipe pistol and then rage that they weren't getting a 3* legendary
---
so far it does not look like it..
---
I‚Äôm taking shots at people for not being considerate with the use of vending machines. Good deals and rare items can offset a bad aesthetic... just make the trip worth it in some way. Hell, send me into your death trap, if it‚Äôs cool then.. cool!
---
Yes PC. We may be playing on different servers cause I see the same groups all the time and server hopping just doesn't work for me in survival.
---
I don't want to witch Hunt either. If those letters refer to the first letters for their accounts then I am thinking of someone else. P in my case is the guy who shot through walls and I've seen YouTube footage of him doing it to some of the better players.
---
I mean I know a guy whose name starts with D but I haven't seen him in a while. And the chick who one shotted me in whitespringns had a username that started with J. But she never shot through walls. Just very good aim. And that damn laser rifle. She usually dominates when she plays and she has a crew.
---
But I also know I am a beginner in PvP. And there are going to be people destroying me out there.
---
And if your reddit name is also your IGN then I have never been on a server with you. My reddit name is not my IGN for security reasons.
---
You can never get actionable data from surveys.  They are all inherently biased.  Any statistics class would teach you this.
---
I think anyone that is involved in the event should get the reward from the boss at the end even if they don't tag it.  This would make people concentrate on the objectives and successfully completing the event, rather than just going for the tag. It's hard to blame them though.  Success should be tied to the completion more than the boss kill. JMO
---
Involvement should include defending livestock, healing players, killing adds, etc.  Not some level 8 guy hiding in the corner.
---
Don't you love the game dynamics. Lmao! This has happened to me a few times now. I call it poaching, they get you to do the work and score your kill. What I do is let them hit me by accident  and then I wait until they go and loot the subject of interest, then I smash them and kill them. Lesson learned. I consider it, like getting mugged. I will give you what you want, but when your gard is down,  I am going to fuck your day up. Lol. Sorry for being so blunt, but some people need to learn about respect the hard way! And I  am the one that will show you the wrath of God. I wish everyone the best, I hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
Fair enough, I know it can be a slippery slope when you start changing stuff for convenience (RIP RS3) though I still want the hacking and picking perks to be one card
---
I sell a good amount of the high demand ammo for 1 cap each (5.56, 5mm) I only use gauss so I tend to have an abundance of nost other types. The rest comes from plans. I have sold some bubbles and aid stuff and maybe one or two weapons(tho I dont normally sell weapons). 
---
I get good foot traffic being near a train station and a free range event spot.
---
I'd be glad to follow the objectives, but
---
* It is unclear what I'm supposed to collect
---
* When its clear, the food doesn't spawn, so can't learn where to look
---
* Enemies/end boss one-hit kill the friendly animals
---
* Friendly animal block shots
---
* Not enough people (I've seen an average of 3) to cover and defend all 3 positions to begin with.
---
So what's left is getting the 3\* at the end and possibly the legendary robot spawn.
---
A rifle.
---
2 is reserved for someone right now. It's a bid.
---
You‚Äôre obviously happy to be farmed for caps, noted - no, it‚Äôs the way it is because Bethesda don‚Äôt listen to people... 
---
If ‚ÄòSurvival‚Äô had a higher cap rate for deaths they wouldn‚Äôt be in adventure mode, would they?
---
Ah gotcha, I feel confident that isn't what was going on though. I was at the lumber yard south of Vault 76 the last time it happened and the guy who killed me was in Berkeley Springs (he was on the leaderboard so I was able to see where he was in Survival).
---
Basically I was collecting wood and suddenly my health bar started dropping rapidly but I wasn't getting a hit indicator. I looked around trying to stim through it, but when I couldn't see anyone I gave up and died. Respawned immediately and checked the map and like I said, my murderer was in Berkeley Springs. I only even bothered to message him because it was so weird I thought maybe I died to a weird bug/glitch and it just said it was him because he was the last player to shoot me (we had a run in about 10-15 minutes prior), but he never responded.
---
Too many things to list.  It‚Äôs a messy game but fun in so many ways.  The map is big, gorgeous and fun to explore.  The aesthetic and humor of classic Fallout.  I hated multiplayer initially but love it now.   Outfits‚Äîstrangely, given I hate fashion in real life.   The new content keeping things fresh.   The ability to switch playstyles on the fly.
---
That is in fact a good point. Thank you  :)
---
I built my CAMP before vending, and before I knew that players spawn where I initially placed the CAMP device. I'm not tearing down my whole CAMP to accommodate you, so arrows and lights will have to do.
---
If we could just get fast travel mats, it would solve the problem.
---
Yes! We are working on this feature for a future update.
---
Doesnt work for me no
---
Fix them bugs, then build them walls!
---
Why?
---
I think that would people ignore the Brahmin more and encourage more one shouting to get that outstanding performance
---
Well I feel that lowering prices makes a good market but for those who make everything extremely high will not make much profit.
---
I saw Toilet paper sold for 7,676 caps. I told the guy and he said Idk.
---
2500 and I‚Äôm on now if you want to get rid of it
---
Same nickname here and there. It must be a nice feeling for J if she/he reads that and knows people were considering if they are not another incarnation of missing D player, so good they are. With survival, there are less open servers at the same time, hence if most are full you usually end up where you left.
---
The grog axe doesn't show up under the weapons workbench unless it has lost enough condition to be repaired. It's not a weapon we can mod, so it just "disappears" from the menu after it has been repaired/doesn't need repairing
---
The ability to shut down after a long week, and "be someone else".
---
To me, this is a RPG with other people running around in it. I love making character-builds, building CAMPs that fit the character I am playing. Making "house rules" for myself. Making in-game choices that my character would make, as opposed to META-build choices. I like building CAMPs that tell a story about who lives there.
---
I like exploring and hunting for easter eggs and secrets. Reading all the little stories and tales left behind, finding little vignettes and piecing together puzzles left behind in settings. 
---
Mostly? I seem to really enjoy creating characters that populate the world, and hopefully add something enjoyable for other players... beyond "yet another dude in power armour living in a floating CAMP".
---
Time is not the factor in Arktos. If you are in one of the two habitats where the Alpha is not, and you are trying to protect the friendly to achieve full event rewards for all participants, you are literally not going to be able to tag the Alpha at all. That's the problem. The Alpha is plenty strong in Arktos, without necessarily being a bullet sponge.
---
Personally I just stuck with the all rise as I could get its damage up in the higher 300s with drugs, food ect. As for the grognak axe not showing up that sounds like a bug too me.
---
I‚Äôd like to second and third this for myself and my wife. It makes no sense to auto scrap it!
---
It‚Äôs not just ammo. Faster kills makes everything ‚Äúeasier‚Äù. Fewer weapon repairs. Fewer armor repairs. Less aid items used. Faster clear times.
---
Okay, so excuse this probably dumb question, but what camp keypad are you talking about? Idk if I‚Äôve ever seen anything like that!
---
Thanks thought I was going mad.
---
Building CAMPs
---
It's an online game, these things weren't designed to be done solo. It's more annoying when an event glitches and you get 1 enemy per wave.
---
I'd say its lag and gameplay reasons, each time you open the stash the server has to send you all the item information, if everyone on the server is opening and closing stashes, or joining the server and opening their stash you're going to have lag spikes if ppl are opening bottomless inventories with 100+mb of item data they need to download.
---
then you have the economy balance, if you have endless space then you never really need to worry about loot, with limitless inventories you can just pick up everything and not worry about it. you'd basically remove that aspect of decision making 'is it worth picking that up' when you have infinite space you might as well just grab everything.
---
Well, keeping the Brahmin alive and healthy is a measure of performance so they would be doing it wrong...
---
^This right here
---
I‚Äôve been following the battlefront subreddit for a year now, and things only change when people offer good solutions instead of just rioting. A lot has changed, but it‚Äôs a shame it took a year and a half. 
---
Fallout 76 is improving at a much faster rate so I‚Äôm pretty hopeful for the future, but the I agree ; the community needs to offer solutions instead of just ranting.
---
If he was pack mule then it was stupid of his team to leave him stranded lol, I'm sure they're really pissed about all they lost. I just dont understand all the salt and pepper the person had, it's like he was roleplaying as an avid baker
---
I've seen this requested a few times and have added it to the feedback list. Thank you!
---
Any semi auto rifle with quality legendary attributes is good. I like sentinel armor, especially if I get "found" by the enemies. I can just stand up and keep firing away at them.  Obviously sneak shots for the opening salvo.
---
I dont get farmed for caps for and I dont be stupid to keep my  10k caps on me it's on my alt also I farmed for my caps and gear to be better along with a better build the only problem here is people like you who dont want to spend time for a focused build or gear for said build
---
I'll be home in the next 2 hours or so. Still will be on?
---
yeah i‚Äôve been reading/seeing that a lot of players are harvesting legendaries and not actually doing the event tasks.
---
Looks. Good to me
---
Wooow
---
Thank you for doing this!  Loved it!
---
It just works.
---
I can add it. Won't be on until later tonight though, 9PM EST, or maybe earlier on Friday.
---
GT same as ID. I can also do shadowed, deep pocketed, ultralight for for limbs.
---
Don't need caps, may need the rarer mats though.
---
It‚Äôs not really if you don‚Äôt get loot if you don‚Äôt tag anything. Hopefully they fix that though.
---
I'm aware there will be trolls but regardless thought it was worth a try, myself and I imagine others will find it interesting at least. Never furthered my basic education so I never got to have 'statistics class'.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about - Fallout 4 with friends is *literally* how Fallout 76 started, by Howard's own words.
---
Watch some of Jug‚Äôs building videos to learn some cool secrets to base building. Then just lots and lots of practice. I build maybe 30-40 elaborate and fully decorated camps just to try new techniques and stuff. There‚Äôs so much stuff that can be done but it all takes practice. 
---
I‚Äôve settled into my ‚Äúforever camp‚Äù well over a month ago. Had it set up like a store even before player vending and it‚Äôs still the same style now, but with the ability to serve more people simultaneously. I‚Äôve been making small decorative changes since building it, but frequently get compliments on it. [Here‚Äôs one picture of it](https://imgur.com/gallery/QWWyM99)
---
Is it worth selling or should I just scrap it for script. I‚Äôm really struggling to get 150 a day and that‚Äôs buying them out of players vendors.
---
Not much improvements since beta? You're kidding right?
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre in a situation where leaving a trail actually makes sense. I have no problem with that.
---
I'm talking about found ammo.
---
I've been playing since beta test and visited other shops too. But each player is their own.
---
Also somehow the sales system isn't working the right way at times. I think it needs to be fixed a little bit.
---
I have no duped gear and hold my own fine, that's an overused excuse
---
Of course I want it better that's why I'm sticking with it instead of ignoring it exist as to me it's plenty fun
---
Interesting... what is gold good for in this game?
---
Commented this in another post, but we've seen this requested in the past and I've added it to the feedback list. Thank you for posting!
---
They are functional. They add some weight from 30 to 120.
---
Basic lvl 50 backpack adds u 60 weight, then u have to go farm some badges and u can buy some mods for it. All mods that adds some resistance in the same time decreases ur weight to 30, so I‚Äôm runnin anti radiation. And 120 high capacity backpack decreases ur resistance by 90. So get them it‚Äôs kinda cool and fresh stuff in game
---
Im on ps4 and i got this error  i have done nothing to get banned no duping or anything im unsure if this could be related to banning
---
Not sure why, but nobody ever seems to come by my camp anymore! I haven‚Äôt gotten a sale in a while, which is strange since I price my stuff fairly and my shop is located just south west of Morgantown!
---
Thank you for sharing your opinion üôÇ
---
Meh.
---
Hell, one of character can't keep teddy bears and toy aliens in stock.
---
I still can‚Äôt get over how heartbreaking the Mistress of Mysteries storyline/holotapes were. I think I cried a little at the end. Plus, I‚Äôll never forget my first foray to the Alpine River Cabins! That was just freaky and wonderful!
---
There aren't any mods for the axe, so if its condition is 100% or better, it won't show up in the weapons bench since there's nothing else you can do with it. I carry both (well, mine's a zealot's Grognak) and use the axe solely for Scorched/SB/SBQ encounters, All Rise for everything else. I don't think I'd carry a separate weapon that's only advantageous to supermutants when I can already one- or two-shot them.
---
I can add it for free, if you don't mind waiting. Check my other post here
---
The mod is like 91 caps at the grafton vendor when you can find it.
---
I don't know why it's giving me less than what is made for profit
---
I once met a player. Reconed the guy, kept following. Scored a good positions, sent some bullets in. Nothing happened, so I moved closer. Seen the guy running in place. Send some more bullets, there's a glitch that can show you running while you stand still, maybe thats it. No reaction. Two minutes later I get a kill and his loot bag appears few hundred meters from position where I shoot him at.
---
Yes atom shop. Yes flames. And one for each style of armor, not excavator. Pretty hideous but awesome too.
---
You need it to make armor deep pocketed and you may need it for laser weapons.
---
I just want a fast travel mat that I can put down a few feet away from my front door, cause too many people spawn in the back of my house, and end up leaving the back door open. It's annoying üôÉ
---
You make many assumptions young Padawan yet no nothing of my build or equipment and most sentinel armour doesn‚Äôt drop from every Ghoul or Sheepsquatch...
---
Failed the event 2 times last night cause everyone bailed on the creatures for the alpha. i just want the backpack, dont care about the (most likely) one star
---
I also found this video yesterday. Must've hit a trending or something when looking at youtube fallout 76.
---
If one comes out then yea theres one. If not then there isnt
---
Chernobyl happened in the late 80's
---
 Toxic, Toxic, bo-boxic
---
Banana-fana fo-foxic 
---
Fee-fi-mo-moxic 
---
Toxic!
---
For PvP I prefer a meaningful engagement that lasts a while - not going to happen in this game given its just build and gear dependent instead of actual player skills.  IMO - just remove PvP and I won't miss it one bit.
---
For PvE, its always fun to run around in the endgame feeling like you're a "boss" yourself, most things should be pretty easy to dispatch.  The recent bosses are a good balance - they're tanky and can really dish out some punishment.  The imposter takes down bloodied players like flies.  Having good bosses and some stronger enemies is a great balance - show me a player that can run headlong into hordes of gutsies or super mutants all day long and never die, and you might change my mind.  1 on 1 or 1 vs. few isn't a good measure for PvE.
---
Ok you will fast travel to event for scraps but complain about doing same for vendor...lol
---
I don't count atom shop items as improvements.
---
Permission to open a PC chapter, Den Mother?
---
Well damn yeah I‚Äôll wait.. I appreciate it man
---
The mods are available at Grafton, but it pulls from all armor types, so there's just a chance the conbat will be there
---
You can go into the game files easily and change a 50 to 75, you're right.
---
Then you recompile the code to make the correct game file type.  I'm assuming there's plenty of modularity in the game files, so that should only take a few minutes.
---
Then you submit the changes to the game files - for PC, they upload to their patch servers and push an update.  Yay, all done in less than an hour.
---
For console, you push the update to the XB/PS stores.  And pay the update fee.  And wait for review.  And after approval, you wait for deployment. Then yay!  It's deployed after a week.  And in the mean time, you've found 75 other quick fixes and a few major bugs that need to be updated as well, so you start the whole process again.
---
On PC (except steam, which is similar to consoles, but doesn't apply here), the process is long and fairly expensive, and it's better in the long run to plan the updates ahead.  It will save them time overall, and a *lot* of money.
---
Oh, and thinking about pushing the PC update before the consoles get theirs?  Have fun with the backlash from that!
---
I heard of fast travel mats in workshops but I can't find it in my CAMP. I don't know why it's not there. It would help out alot.
---
I explore the game the same way you do, with PvP as my endgame and my break from the exploration. I enjoy both "worlds" of the gameplay. I explore and take my time to work to that endgame, and I don't want them to neuter the game (in all aspects) because I actually enjoy this game.   
---
If I wanted enough QOL changes to allow my character to do it all, then I would simply play one of the previous Fallout games or wait for the next single player one. My argument is that there is a push to make this game so much easier for meta purposes and I am arguing against doing that.
---
If you spend 30 caps to directly fast travel to the event, do half the damage by pumping bullets into the Legendary SheepSquatchs and also clear out the mobs,  When you die and respawn == You SHOULD be getting the "Event Completion loot" and also able to loot the Legendary !
---
I know it doesn't that's why it's called farming for legendarys it took me a couple months to get my armor and gear but if you spent half the time farming as you did complaining you would have all your gear
---
Haha fair enough! It just looks so lifeless ;)
---
I saw a camp that sorta did this. They used the slanted eaves to make narrow gaps at the corners, and placed a turret in the gap with the barrel sticking out. looked great.
---
That‚Äôs great! I mean, yeah. I‚Äôve built some really cool, elaborate, hugely involved camps. But some of the camps I go to, it looks like they had to have been exploiting some glitch. I thought all the glitches I knew had been nerfed. Apparently not. :)
---
i am level 121 and this weekend I was playing uranium fever with a level 110 and a level 160ish.  pissed me off big time that the level 160 was one hit killing everything he could even though me and the level 110 used machine gun style stuff so we could share the "kills". can't one hit kill a three star mole miner but there are way faster methods for me to kill him then with my .50 caliber machine gun.   after the event he fast traveled away, i walked outside and had a three star legendary just for me, karma :p
---
I would even like just the exposed brick inside and out. But the interior of the brick walls rigjt now are awful
---
The reason they picked the clicking sound for radiation damage is it is the classic Geiger counter sound.   Each particle hitting the plate made a ‚Äúclick.‚Äù   More particles, more clicks.
---
Maybe one day I find it fun, for now I prefer the fights to last a bit.
---
He‚Äôs mainly melee + 50 Cal (obviously)
---
 I have seen, well every time, Dense for everything else but Combat Armour.
---
Almost like GTA where you can choose which location you want to load in
---
I sell everything dirt cheap as a reward for visiting my camp.
---
It just keeps pilling up.
---
Yes but what is "close enough" in Arktos? Also, while I'm pretty much always on a team, not everyone has a team. And we are usually 4 and cannot add any singles. It would be good to just make everyone participating as though they were on a large team. The do it for some events where you can't damage other players while the event is active.
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
I think you might be onto something there, I actually had something similar happen to me. Saw a guy running in place in Survival, thought it was really weird. Watched him for a minute or so before curiosity got the best of me and I lit him up. His health went down and then shot back up. I left without killing him though because I thought maybe he was lagged/glitched out and felt bad that he couldn't fight back.
---
Damn... I thought it was another clickbait video, you learn something everyday huh
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, the weapon is fully repaired and you cannot mod a grognaks axe
---
No.
---
Low level characters that can only afford a couple dozen cartridges.
---
I'm for that.
---
I rarely use the default price in mine. I‚Äôm probably slightly screwing myself, but I just always try to price my stuff at below cost. I started at pricing half price, but I at least try to knock off a decent percentage.
---
Ive gotten the Stimpak Diffuser plan, Bear Arm Plan, Formula P recipe 2 times, Arktos Backpack Skin, Bear Arm 3 times, Arktos Labcoat 3 times and a bunch of plants.  I dont know what else is left to get but I will keep trying.
---
&gt;  I also have garage doors "inside" brick walls so I can close my windows nuclear bunker style.
---
Brilliant!
---
Each player is different but no one is going to buy shotgun shells for 5 if everybody else is selling them for one.
---
The ammo price meta is 1 cap, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to point out.
---
It's probably a glitch.
---
You just admitted you farm other players in your previous post? You realise you‚Äôre part of the problem and don‚Äôt want any fair change of retaliation. Clearly part of the problem... 
---
Good day Jayce and the Keyboard Warriors
---
ohhhh I saw a three star radium rifle on sale for like 10k in a vendor, confused the heck out of me.
---
Find something with swingspeed.
---
Todd is just a figure head, and if you listen to him, you're going to be lost. He sells games and keeps his company from bankruptcy. It is all he has ever done.   
---
Listen to the people that don't change what they say every time they are in front of a different crowd or under pressure from the public. All I have said is that Todd said the devs get strong influences from this community.
---
Ran uranium fever last night. Wanted trash legendary for scrip. Some jerk was there didn't shoot a thing except 1 shot the supervisors and talked trash for no reason on open mic, no one else talking or replying he just trying his hardest to insult everyone.
---
Swapped servers after that. But guys like that piss me off. Let me at least gun bash the thing, letting everyone tag won't hurt him.
---
If I'm alone I'll one shot, if not I switch to a much weaker weapon.
---
But for every jerk like him I've met way more who are nice and make sure everyone gets a tag.
---
Maybe there's a Reddit mod you could install to make your jokes more original.
---
I would recommend scrapping it for scrip, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt have a very good roll
---
This is beyond awesome!
---
Personally I feel like you are missing one gun army perk in luck and bloody mess in luck and fireproof in endurance. Radicool and the one that heals radiation seem to counter each other imo and I honestly don't think the energy resist is worth while (but all these are just me being picky) other than that it looks good especially if you enjoy playing it that way.
---
Yup it's also like that in the french version, and maybe in others versions as well ? The translation team really fucked up... but it has benefit this time :3

---
&gt;I just figured out how to do ^this and I‚Äôm pretty glad^tm
---
Wait ^till ^^you ^^^learn ^^^^they ^^^^^stack
---
Yeah there was really funny post about this here few months back, not sure can I find it anymore
---
Your insults are about as thoughtful as your shitposting
---
Well, I've got caps to spend... but I 100% guarantee you that if I open your vendor, and you're asking 100% or higher of vendor-bot pricing... I'm not buying anything you have.
---
I can move down the road and find plans for 20 caps... I ain't buying yours for 50.
---
...and, I pay it forward. My stuff is CHEAP.
---
There should be but usually it's later (1-1.5 hr from now).
---
You can always do the new purveyor and try your luck, eventually you should get something decent to good, if not god tier. 
---
I've found a lot of great deals by going through player vendors.
---
If you need scrip (and a chance to get a good legendary), I usually farm WS, West Tek, and now the new Arktos Pharma (lots of legendaries there). 
---
Anything with faster swing speed will most likely be better than All Rise (better overall dps), furious and instigating are really good. Antiarmor is great if you can find it. Vampire is great, even moreso if you go bloodied. 
---
I have a bloodied baseball bat with faster swing speed and more damage on power attack, thing is a beast at 420 dmg and 30 energy dmg (I'm not even melee and no perks invested). I found that gem at a player vendor for 1k caps. Was a steal
---
it means flatwoods monster.
---
Don‚Äôt know about the recent bosses, but my friend mows down mobs of mutants without breaking a sweat.
---
Yeah. I only use it for 5.56. It caps at 200 but I get 5 about every 40 seconds. So it caps for me every half hour or so
---
Also an archive of such for old notes, holotapes, etc. having to carry them around just clutters the inventory!
---
I'll trade you for my Vampire Rolling Pin i got yesterday. Or the junkie pool cue i got the day before. Or possibly even the fantastic Nocturnal machete from the day before that.
---
Unless you mean my first one which it seems you forgot the enemies drop caps too
---
They should take a page from other MMO's like in FFXIV for example. As long as you are in the quest area you are participating in it, however your rewards are different depending on how much you contribute. None/Bronze/Silver/Gold and each will give out items/exp/money depending on how much you do. This could be a good fix for people who just go to an event and idle there without doing anything else to help.
---
Might depend on the music lol
---
I do believe if you return to the production sector of the hall of mysteries, you can be printed a new one with the terminal.
---
And if it glitches like it did for me and tells you to go back to the basement a second time, just walk outside and back in and the marker will fix itself.
---
&gt;Agreed. SELL YOUR INSTIGATING 1* ITEMS.
---
Weapon/effect combos are way too situational to make a blanket statement like that. Instigating fire axe? Heck yeah, someone will probably buy it for a couple hundred caps. Instigating Ripper? Mmm, not so much.
---
stash them or make a mule if you don't have space. or sell the heaviest 1 star ones, you can lose 5 to 15 scrip, it's not the end of the world.
---
They^stack^?
---
I never seem to get anything good. Or maybe I have and just didn‚Äôt know it. I‚Äôm still using a 1 star level 35 aa handmade. Need a better one with a higher level but never find one.
---
Butcher's bounty procs, but only gives you radstag meat, not more venison.

Haven't tried the horde boss method yet from that video but I tried the One Violent Night trick from the same video yesterday and not a single legendary spawned in, though it may have been from a spawning glitch. By the time I had gotten the bar to initiate the 2nd growl of the Nightstalker I had killed a ton of ghouls and even though I had looted all their corpses their meat piles remained. At that point I'd only get one or two ghouls spawning at a time and while they almost all were crowned none were legendary.
---
I was definitely stocked up on stims and chems by the end of it though so it wasn't all bad.
---
then I'd get the mask if you rarely use PA, and why you buy the skins for it is beyond me, but if you aren't gonna use it much, why buy something for it?
---
Will they fix melee? It‚Äôs really frustrating how they broke 1/3 of the weapons in the game 2-3 patches ago and have just left them completely hanging.
---
You would think something like that would be a first order priority.
---
Never noticed this, it's a nice touch. I always had a love for that kind of small detail. It's the stuff they don't have to do but choose to.
---
Well, you can always nuke SBQ and that takes a few minutes to kill =). I am a meta gamer, min/maxer, through and through. I can't play games any other way. Comes from many years of playing wow and being in "bleeding edge" content clearing guilds there, where you have to optimize not only yourself, but as a raid leader you have to make sure everyone else is optimizing and doing as much damage and playing as optimally as possible to have a chance at downing the boss.
---
If I see/find an optimal way to play, I will play that way, period. That is what is fun to me. I love showing people what is possible if they put the effort into optimizing. It also helps that Heavy weapons with power armor is my absolute favorite play style in Fallout, and it also happens to be the best pve dps in Fallout 76.
---
Thank you so much for silver and gold badge! &lt;3
---
have you tried certain reddits and sites that i'm not sure if i can name.
---
I personally think maxed Bloody Mess (+15% dmg to all weapons, and enemies sometimes may explode into a bloody mess) in Luck category is a must have for all, but I see you're not running many luck points so . . . Also in the Luck category is One Gun Army - Heavy guns gain a 4% stagger chance and a 12% chance to cripple a limb. Outside of that, looks pretty good. I may need to look into Bullet Shield, never really noticed it before. But I like what it's saying.
---
I feel you may like a Berserker build! Have you looked into or tried it?
---
Oh, I don't want it "easier" at all.
---
I want... MORE. I want more stuff to build with, and more choices to build with (said it before,  but I want the in-game detritus and trash. The torn walls and piles of refuse. Upside down desks and piles of rubble.).
---
Screw META gaming. Honestly. META gaming is the cancer of the gaming industry.
---
I like that in elder scrolls and fallout, that I can collect everything, every cool weapon can be in my chest^^ that ist what makes fun for me, collecting. Server problems can be the reason, some people say that it does not effect the server if you have more stash, but I am no expert, maybe they can make it unlimited for just ammo, or just junk
---
Thank you so much for Silver and Gold badge, love y' all!
---
BGS is trying super hard to get people to play teams, but thats just not realistic. Some people dont have friends, and others do, but they may not be playing or on the right server. Big events like this should be like launching a nuke. All players on board who are capable, and yes! the reward comes from successfully completing objectives, and not just tagging the boss.
---
another disaster is herding the cows. nobody cares about protecting the herd (so the rewards might be better)...they just tag along until the boss comes out and its usually a crappy 1\* even if it says 3\*...so sick of that.
---
Thank you
---
To honest i was really hoping to find an easter egg to FNaF in that place, like a terminal entry or something. 
---
But a survival event at night would be nice to stay in the theme (like survive until 6am against enemies with unique skin (mascottes for exemple) )
---
You‚Äôre telling me you gained enough caps by farming mutants that drop up to ten caps max, enough to buy Sentinel 3 star armour that sells for 10,000 caps a piece by ‚Äòfarming‚Äô alone?!
---
Yeah right, I‚Äôve just realised this conversation is futile...
---
which probably gives you a 1\* wood arm
---
Had a guy do that with me once, just us two in the event at the time, then he taunted me about it.  Later other people showed up and one asked me about my weapon and I replied in area chat and he did not repeat his actions.  I dunno, maybe he thought I was Chinese do to my name Xiccarph, and I do get random invites from people with east asian names at times.  Never thought of that when I picked my name, which is actually the title of a book of fantasy stories by Clark Ashton Smith, a contemporary of Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiccarph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiccarph)If I had known then that my character name was not displayed and my account was I would have done things differently.
---
No. It didn‚Äôt. Thanks for the tip though.
---
Mods were available at Grafton/Watoga before they "fixed" the vendor inventories, just *extremely* rare. I used to make quite a few caps from farming them, and the BOS armor mod plans.
---
I can vouch that at least the Grafton one still carries the CA dense mods. I checked out of curiosity afternpatch, and bought the one it had.
---
Yes, I was thinking maybe some of super big Neon Mothman or Appalachia signs would look good with it.
---
Yes, it goes both ways. It sucks when it is too hard for one person and waaay too easy for a group.
---
But 10% is a lot of percent. Kidding seems like pretty solid advice.
---
you get a backpack from this event???
---
Well, did you buy any of your gear? 
---
But either way, my point was that duped gear just shed light on the problem, which is that the game is very poorly imbalanced for competitive pvp.
---
Made a post like this at launch and everyone just said no, just use Molotov‚Äôs. LUL RIP
---
So, just an FYI, there is no need to blow through stims during imposter,  just respawn. Unlike a lot of the fights you'll respawn right in the event. If you've dump off your junk before hand there is no downside to it. Even if you die and the imposter gets ganked while you are respawning if you got a hit in you're golden. I used to do the same, spam stims, but once I figured out it's not needed I'll got and be a conduit on all 3 pylons and just keep doing that until the imposter is down...
---
add another caret to each word. word 1 has 1, word 2 has 2, etc.
---
  &gt;They^stack^^?
---
Since I'm sick and was enjoying the debate/conversation, what /are/ some QOL changed you'd like to see?
---
Agreed, wouldn‚Äôt mind this for free range as well
---
I‚Äôd probably drop Refractor &amp; Power Patcher, swap in Bloody Mess &amp; One Gun Army, probably a point in Tenderiser &amp; Suppressor too.
---
I can‚Äôt find any posted numbers but I feel/see hat the tuned wave burn is the better. 
---
It should have tiered at. Each of the capacitors should have moved the burn or ammo around to suite the player. The tuned should be more weight but better burn and ammo and the others should offer either more burn less ammo and the other ammo or burn. That way each rifle could have specific role.
---
It's one of the tooltips and I still forgot about it xD
---
I've noticed a lot of very small details that the deeves have injected into this game. It definitely adds up quite a bit to the game.
---
I‚Äôll bag on this game as much as the next guy, but this statement is incredibly false.
---
When the game first released you couldn‚Äôt even play for more 2 or 3 hours at a time without getting booted from the game.
---
If you‚Äôre even still playing the game anymore (or ever did), and you‚Äôre still having issues this bad, it‚Äôs time to look at what‚Äôs going wrong with your own computer.
---
That‚Äôs super fair, thanks for sharing your opinion.
---
I prefer some sense of danger, awe, aventure and exploration, I don‚Äôt get that if I can one-shot everything on site.
---
One-shot is much harder now. You‚Äôre just bad
---
I got a bloodied explosive pump action from it
---
Oh..... thanks!
---
Yup.
---
It's kind of random and depends on what type of cryptid you run into, some are more likely to fight while others won't. Flatwood monster doesn't really drop anything special. Mothman on the other hand drop mothman wings which I still haven't found and I'm close to 3 dozen in the last couple months.
---
Depends on what it is. Something relatively useless like a +1 Agility or "bigger sweet spot while lock picking" bobblehead? Sell it for 50 caps and someone might buy it to complete a collection. Leadership bobblehead that gives you +5% xp? 100 caps seems fair.
---
No I'm saying that people like you make this community great
---
A skin, yes.
---
We NEED melee fixed. 1/3 of the weapons in the game are broken
---
I did 40 yesterday. No paint.
---
We are basically on the same page as far as how the game needs to go then, lol.   
---
I am completely content with how the game plays itself, I could play it in its state for years, and I think the only changes that need to come are content (monsters/raiders, building ideas, etc) and a proper survival mode. I'm arguing the changes people make in this reddit because they need it to be easier to pick this lock or hack this terminal to compete with other players; to be part of the meta. Or because they thing its to damn hard to get their god tier legendary weapon with the perfect perks on it.   
---
Like I said, we both agree there is no need to make it easier at all, and I'm simply saying that doing so will kill the game.
---
I‚Äôm curious why you say sell your ammo for 2 or more.  I personally won‚Äôt buy common ammo above 1 cap each.  I‚Äôll see people camp with 900 .45 ammo at 2 caps each and I‚Äôll pass,  but if it was at one cap I‚Äôd buy it all.  They could‚Äôve made 810 caps from me but made zero because it‚Äôs priced too high. I wish you could box up ammo and sell it that way.
---
No melee fix anytime soon:(
---
It's not competitive, that's taking it way too serious. Bought maybe 2-3 pieces in total that use and know at least 2 we're drops they had gotten. Was a big believer early days if I just bought something it felt like cheating, so I just farmed legendaries for a while til I got what I needed
---
Yeah, I sell most ammo at 1/round. The only exception is mini nukes and plasma cores. 
---
The things is, I *want* to get rid of this stuff. It's almost always ammo that doesn't work for my build. It's either going to take up space, I'm going to ditch it somewhere for free, or I can sell it for dirt cheap.
---
Not in PVE.
---
It‚Äôs not about being bad, it‚Äôs about owning gear, perks and doing a build.
---
Duh
---
I have never seen it myself. Nor have I heard of it until now.
---
Never said I have sentinels lmao also remember legendarys also sell jesus you dont think do you if you look at my profile you would see I sell stuff too not often but occasionally
---
Some food for thought, the main reason explosive laser rifles suddenly became meta was to counter Sentinels.  With beam splitter the multiple rapid explosions quickly cause the target to stagger which nullifies Sentinel.
---
The unfortunate downside is that they are even more effective against normal armor, which is why casual-pvp'ers die quickly to the more hardcore-pvp'ers.
---
Yeah, I forgot about bloody mess but one gun army is probably not my thing. I don‚Äôt play PVP; only PVE. I would understand why you would put it though. 
---
Thank for sharing your opinion üôÇ
---
Arktos Backpack Skin. Looks pretty cool
---
 I will keep checking but I have been there at least 5 times in the last couple of days.
---
No idea what you're talking about. Haven't had that problem.
---
Probably, like every other 3*.
---
All of my Atom gets spent on floors, doors, and the one set of stairs that's available.  I don't care about chintzy decorations or furniture or posters or any of that, I just want to build awesome looking structures that don't look like the bombs *just* fell on them. Are we trying to rebuild america or not! &lt;3
---
Maybe not even 10%?
---
Unfortunately Bethesda isn't very transparent with this stuff but......
---
I've read posts where others have shown that there is a cap to how much armor penetration you can have. If the cap were at 80% (made up number) and you're running tank killer for +36% w/40% from perforating mag..... you'd be at 76%.
---
No kidding? WoW. In over 600 hours I can't believe I have never noticed this.
---
Dat most sold list tho.
---
What should that stuff be priced at my peeps?
---
Is it okay if I message you on Xbox too? I'd love a bit of dense. ;)
---
The problem with any fire/poison/bleed damage on weapons currently is that they do a tiny amount of damage. We‚Äôre talking 2-7hp/tick. On a player that can be meaningful (especially low health players) but on enemies? L68 Supermutants have, what, 500-600hp? The queen has like 500k? It‚Äôs useless.
---
No its not, but it works like this everywhere and in many events and if too many people abuse this then ya, they might change how that works in events which will probably mean restrictions on random legendary spawns without warning. Don't get me wrong on the abuse part though, not acting like I am innocent here, I do it too. Just calling a spade when I see one.
---
The top 10 sold list is...intriguing
---
Looks like I need to start selling fusion cores instead of dumping them!
---
I agree.
---
On a related topic, I just did Line in the Sand a few days ago and I was in the building the entire time - I didn't actively participate in the event in any way - I didn't fix the sonic generator, I didn't do the pre-battle checks, I didn't shoot any Scorched or Scorchbeast - I was on the 4th floor fiddling with my power armor the entire time - and I got the rewards anyway!
---
So, my point is, there's glitchiness afoot...
---
Is it possible that you are accidentally taking advantage of the game feature that allows you to choose to increase your special in one attribute, but pick a perk card from another? (i.e. you clicked on Strength, then switched to Agility Cards and chose your perk?)
---
Sure, it's an open offer.
---
Hmmmm, I can‚Äôt seem to do It. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm on mobile.
---
They're still doing new patches, they're just 'done' with adding new content for the next few weeks. Hopefully, that means more fixes.
---
Yeah says something that the only way to stop more from spawning is to kill the alpha, dunno if it is on loading screen or on the event itself.
---
Wasn't this in fallout 4?
---
Definitely your build. If you max rank demo expert that explosive SMG will destroy any non-legendary explosive weapon in terms of both damage output and resource costs for ammo. Especially if you take at least one rank of each Commando perk.
---
If you go that route I'd recommend getting 3 ranks of Fireproof though to help avoid killing yourself :)
---
What are ppl doing with all those shotgun shells since, according to this sub, shotguns suck balls.
---
loading into the basement seems to be a gamble. I completed the event roughly 5 times yesterday but also crashed closer to 10 times
---
Yeah, I changed a couple of perks. I might make another post in the same subreddit with my ‚Äúbetter‚Äù perks. But, personally I don‚Äôt really like fireproof since I don‚Äôt use exploding weapons (I will probably never will tbh). But, still thanks for pointing out some flaws in my perks.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5Ri0eXAqfcYRC8dLq3qKk5/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-wild-appalachia-concludes
---
This is the correct ITV link for that info.
---
Its' rough.  I've been turning those in since release and am still short the last two paint jobs, just need the Paladin and Elder paints.  I'd be happy to stop at Paladin as that's all I want.
---
Nice, tho just to let you know, reload speed has a cap which is easily reached with speed demon. Unless you don't want to get the mutation, Lock n Load is useless.
---
Which platform are you on? I just finished building an epic little lakeside camp with its own area for vending. I‚Äôm very close to the vault for easy/free fast travel! I‚Äôd love for you to stop by and check out my humble abode. PS4 and my PSN is the same as my reddit name here. Will be on tonight!
---
This is \[my skin after a week of hiking\]([https://i.imgur.com/g5ZftuQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/g5ZftuQ.png)) IRL. Based on my Sicilian grandfather, that chestnut tone wouldn't be too improbable for me if I were out hiking the hills of Appalachia 24/7 for a few months.
---
Ehhh, for PvE I‚Äôm not one to gripe about game balance because it doesn‚Äôt really effect anyone in a player vs player way. 
---
But I will say, they are a serious glass cannon. I have a bloodied friend that does put out insane dmg, but dies all the time. It‚Äôs a trade off I suppose
---
Oops, my bad. Thanks, I updated it.
---
They need to shoot a lot more now I guess lol
---
I've started using a 3 star cryolator so I can tag, while also slowing down the creatures a lot. Really helps for low level legendaries, and is really handy for those big sponge legendaries like the Imposter and Alphas.
---
Don't forget about the people who don't want to complete the ojective in project paradise...
---
Yeah you are probably right.
---
I like the way they look. It's also the only thing even remotely worth buying for me. I'm currently still using a desert rider t51, but I'll be testing out more combinations as time goes on
---
Its not even trolls. its just that no answer can ever be verified.  Also the basic human nature of dishonesty answering opinion questions.
---
SPECIALs all cap at 15. If you're putting every level into a special, then at some point it's going to be full of perk cards and can't go up any higher.
---
This is so funny, and so true haha. I see the majority of high level players use TSE shotguns when I‚Äôm doing events. The stats don‚Äôt lie!
---
35 caps seems like a great deal, especially with how new the event is. I guess somebody either got duplicates or really doesn't like it
---
On plan runs, pre-vending and "fix", I would hit the grafton vendors, grafton steel, and top of the world 10-20 time a single session. 
---
So, 50-100+ times a week...
---
No problem with melee on my end. Is it something more specific then "they broke melee'?
---
There is no immersion in this game. 
---
If you don't like someone's camp, it takes about two seconds to turn your back on it and go somewhere else, and you never have to look at it again.
---
Team shared loot has NEVER worked for me a signal time. I play with my team regularly, this one buddy of mine one shots everything. He always tells me it's ok because I will get to loot them too, I check the body's and no loot at all. We always argue about it, he swears I should get loot but I never do. I'm not sure why, but this feature does not work for all people. Perhaps it's a latency issue? Either way they should FIX that mechanic . And also implement the change you are all speaking of as well.
---
By competitive, I mean skill based. Competition is the whole point of pvp. 
---
Again, the pvp is totally functional. Otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt even be a conversation here. People are engaging in it and having fun. But it‚Äôs still super broken and needs to be fixed.
---
Over 44 million transactions with the purveyor in a single week. That's huge.
---
Sold 4000 caps worth of treasure maps at 50c each and 5 pieces of armor priced at or slightly above asking. 
---
Depends on what it is. One of the pieces was a +1 strength stealth sentinel piece for like 600 caps. 
---
That‚Äôs a steal.
---
I have seven Platinum trophies never once have I gotten anything for achieving it
---
Could they make that any harder?
---
Thanks bud, I'll message you when on. GT JaggersLips13
---
Yeah, sounds like it.
---
Seems to me that most requests on this sub are of the "I want to do it all" type. 
---
But, once a player can "do it all"... then the game becomes as dull as shit... which results in a player base that ONLY wants to see new dungeons and areas... which are fun, until they top out in those areas, and then we're back to square one. 
---
To make a comic book comparison...
---
Superman is a f*cking boring-ass superhero. Superman is the "perk loadout, why can't my weapons have ALL the legendary effects" of the FO universe.
---
I honestly like fireproof for scorchbeasts, makes the screams do no damage
---
*We‚Äôre excited to continue this journey with you, and we can‚Äôt wait to share more details about what we have in store for Appalachia and the Fallout 76 community during our fifth annual Bethesda E3 Showcase. Be sure to join us live when the show kicks off at 5:30 p.m. PT on June 9.*
---
I assume you mean as a bounty and no it doesn't  you get off Scott free.
---
If you're selling 3 star legendaries for 200, I'm buying them just to feed to the chipper.
---
Dunno why you're getting downvoted, this is exactly like the Watoga legendary robots. Working as it logically should but "fixed" to deny legendary loot.
---
I think everyone lol
---
I got what you're saying.  But there are other 'unpopular' games that are generally disdained by the general gaming community, but the absolute love for for the game shows up in their own community.
---
This post is old enough, I guess I won't worry about downvotes...No Man's Sky has been roasted (and not unjustly) since it came out, but the community in their sub is so in love with the game that they weathered the hate and have stuck by it for years.  Even though it's been dramatically improved, and is starting to get some positive attention, there are still a host of haters.  But the game's sub is such an open and welcoming group that it's night and day from what you see outside that group.
---
I love the community here, but there are still a lot of whiners and (mild) toxicity.  But overall it's still a pretty nice crowd.
---
Definitely not the scorched thing. But I think it has something to do with the other vaults. Being able to access them or something
---
Thanks! That's really my whole beef with the explosive legendary effect honestly. It takes away from variations in playstyle and makes an entire class of weapons (non-legendary explosives) completely worthless. But at the same time I understand the cat is out of the bag so to speak in terms of legendary explosive weapons, and tbh I think balance changes are generally better than just removing something entirely from the game.
---
Nice! :)
---
280 seems super low. Does sneak damage make it viable at all? I want to be able to 1 shot level 68 Super Mutants at West Tek. Is that a pipe dream?
---
Do you most solemnly swear to... uh, I dunno, drink a bunch of stuff... maybe kill a few people? I'm winging it here to be totally honest. Skulls would be cool though, I mean I think everyone basically likes those.
---
Yeah, yeah cool. PC Skull Scouts are go. Do you have anything to drink? I could go for some Nuka Cola and Gasoline about now.
---
Ouch
---
These are all reasonable prices that I would be happy to buy at.
---
I found their gt from their camp and pmd them. I am also on xbox I should've clarified that in first response
---
Hey, did you found out the reason for this stutter?
---
I think Bethesda is doing OK. It was far more buggy on release and they did say its a half finished game just to warn us. This past month has had some real good additions. The only thing I don't like is they can not give up on their ancient game engine, its terrible.
---
Ooo I‚Äôd love to check it out! I‚Äôm on Xbox, however. If you post pictures or video be sure to link me
---
It just works
---
Heavy weapons are finally at the top of the dps chart, where they should be.
---
That said *We‚Äôre going to keep releasing patches regularly, and we still have several major updates on the horizon for Fallout 76 in 2019.*
---
So hopefully soon. Also, I‚Äôd love for a hotdog for the new Paradise event. My game always crashes whenever I enter the event. I‚Äôve been able to play 2/10 tries.
---
Wastelanders comes after the vaults, so its not until like late 2019
---
We really need perk loadouts
---
Hmm... if one could find a efficient way to farm them it would probably be a goldmine :)
---
Definitely the best storyline. Would have loved to play it in a normal fallout game where you could choose to side with olivia, shannon or brody or even try and make peace. Gotta think a few survived at the end
---
How much display do you need to drop a rifle and wave a white flag? ;P
---
Why does his level matter? Why does everyone make a big deal out of the players level?
---
Hey let‚Äôs not forget they were supposed to add the whole ‚Äútake items from your stash and place them in your camp‚Äù for decorating. Also display cases.. what the heck?
---
Only thing on that list I have bought and that was once was the marsupial serum. Iv never bought any of the other items ever.
---
They're only opening two Vaults for nuclear winter. There's still two left.
---
You‚Äôre spot on. There is simply no pleasing everyone. 
---
I get a kick out of how everyone says it should be so simple to be able to increase the stash size, or change this for that, etc. 
---
Truth is, unless they work for Bethesda, they have no idea of the complexities of their server architecture and so don‚Äôt know for certain how simple or hard it really is.
---
People need to cut the dev team a break. They‚Äôve pretty much been giving everyone what they want and people still complain. 
---
New quests and features? But what about the bugs?!
---
Fix bugs? Gimme more stash!
---
There are thousands of players all screaming and demanding different things of a team of devs with finite resources to deliver on those demands. Those issues need to be prioritized. This means that not all of them are going to be addressed. 
---
If your issue is isn‚Äôt game breaking and a new more urgent issue comes up, well sorry, dude, you‚Äôre being placed on the back burner.
---
oh no, hide the childrens eyes!
---
Damn, that sucks and would be frustrating as hell. I've noticed that you definitely have to be within a close vicinity for me to get shared loot. Most of us can one shot most enemies, but tend to prefer to save that ammo for bigger fish and use weaker guns and cheaper ammo so we all get a hit in (for xp). Have a melee friend who gives cares not and one shots anyway and if it weren't for shared loot, I'd rather not roll with him much, heh. 
---
Hope they fix it for those of you who haven't been able to share loot while in team and add it to events.
---
Wtf, mutton meat pie recipe is on the top 10 list? I had five of them listed at ONE CAP EACH for like a week before I just dumped them
---
Yeah that's true.
---
Alot of us have been hoarding all the weightless legendary gear we get lol
---
I feel like this is a bit of remnant from the dragon skeleton BS in Skyrim
---
Not against VC, but I actually prefer this format for discussions of this nature, I feel it helps helps "crystallize"  ideas and avoids distractions (having serious discussions while also in game...).  
---
What platform are you on?   
---
You don't have to be rich, I know more than one player that went from nearly nothing to fully equipped it mid-high tier to closing on God Tier items in a few weeks by aggressively pursuing trading, farming known good locations and shrewd negotiations..   
---
Can the casual do that?    
---
No, but I don't think they need to be able too..  Again not elitism, it's about time investment, if Player A is willing to commit the time, and Player B is not, player A should not be penalized for having done the work (dupers aside).  
---
Certain play styles can be boring, but I'm sure being a sniper IRL is 99% boredom as well! ;)    
---
But seriously you are describe a sniper in a blind, I'm sure it's boring for that player to sit waiting for someone to stroll into their firing arc...    
---
BTW which weapons do you think have unlimited range that shouldn't and weapons that don't that should?
---
800+ hours and I haven‚Äôt even seen a flatwoods monster yet let alone seen a player fighting one smh
---
Or make them only in partial suits like missing helmet or arm. Make them look like they fought through hell and back only to have the suit get compromised and they got infected.
---
‚ÄúInitial melee against an enemy do not register
---
Cannot VATs on flying enemies 
---
Inconsistent VATS chances on enemy‚Äôs‚Äù
---
Heres what Bethesda has addressed, those 3 issues the community manager has said they‚Äôre Aware of, but that was 2 weeks ago and these issues have been present 3 patches ago.
---
Here‚Äôs a clip of the issue:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=L_HhbpwbpUs&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
It‚Äôs very frustrating, especially with PvP
---
I would be up for some Legendary Farming... I am only usually on at night on weekdays though (5-9ish Central time) and only occasionally on the weekends.
---
The bloodied build has become a default for many, it has so many benefits and mitigations that cover the weaknesses it has become a default build for many.  There should be several builds competing to be the default, not just one.
---
I got some shells for 1 cap each, seemed to reasonable. Kind of funny cause there is the known glitch, machines not paying out properly for ammo sold... Wonder what the cap total on that is.
---
Damn son
---
There needs to be a definitive guide for the blueprint system. If we can reliably blueprint at least somewhat large structures that can easily be replaced, workshops would be much more interesting
---
your computer or console is broken, dude. It is an order of magnitude more stable than release, with far fewer bugs.
---
Your life must be so sad. I hope you dont die from a heart attack from gaming so much.
---
More people telling other how to play.....
---
Just what we need.
---
How much those go for?
---
Don't forget a half stair version of the stairs we got, maybe even a 2x1 style of it with separate "defense" railings that could be used for a banister or porch.
---
To be clear, that's 44 million scrip spent, not a count of transactions.
---
Challenges like this used to be a joke we said two months ago. Now they're actually in game. Most of them are 10 atoms too
---
yeah i do to, when i started using the keys to get it "close enough" i kinda stopped caring so much.
---
That may be. I don't do mobile, so i would not know.
---
I never really gave this much thought or notice. But a nice touch. I just assumed Phoenix always said ad victorium soldier as part of his spiel, given the fact he is the brotherhood vendor. I never thought it would be because I wear brotherhood stuff.
---
Not really surprising though. This kind of thing did occur in fallout 4 as well, so makes sense.
---
Maybe they notice more than what you wear too though. I was at pleasant valley station where some player was either afk at vendor or severely having a hard time deciding what to buy. After a while I get a little annoyed so decide to make them aware I was there, so I fired a few shots at the ceiling to try to get thier attention. Now it could have been coincidental but the vendor bot then piped up about how hurting other customers wouldn't be tolerated. 
---
Its these little things I love about this game.
---
I do this, but this only works if there are a bunch of others doing the event. If you're trying to do it solo or with very little help, then you die very quickly and will probably run out of time before it does down, since it will be targeting you while you're trying to get the conduits back up again. Hence my point about passing if there isn't enough help.
---
That‚Äôs horrible! I hope they keep updates weekly and I am very excited for the new expansions coming!
---
But I wouldn‚Äôt gloat about ‚Äúthe massive amounts of bugs‚Äù they‚Äôve taken care of, if along the way they essentially broke the competitiveness of an entire class of gameplay
---
Only if you eat too much mystery meat pie.... no I‚Äôm kidding prob just one of those quirky glitches lol
---
Its a risky joke, lets see which way this goes
---
Doing this should make you shunned if anyone sees you, as in previous games.
---
Rekt
---
free probably
---
Windows 10 and only just Bethesda‚Äôs launcher for the game to run. I don‚Äôt have mods nor run anything beside it
---
It‚Äôs the number we‚Äôve all been waiting for.
---
It's sarcasm.
---
 My present char was built to farm the Handmade long ago. He burned out doing that kind of crap, retired to the Mire and walks everywhere now. ;)
---
I place my shop in the Mire so people know I'm not selling low level stuff and junk. 90% of the shops I hit around Whitesprings or the Forest are filled with stuff I'd rather just scrap.
---
Can‚Äôt upvote enough
---
So far I've gotten trashü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And several explaining why it won't happen.  It was in beta and was removed due to abuse.  It is nto comign back.
---
Well then. I guess all ammo will be 1 cap then.
---
There's a lack of AP outside of tank killer, but it's still viable. If you can maintain stealth, you can still 1-shot max lvl mobs, especially with Crit perks. Speed Demon helps, but the 1 time I used it exclusively to clear West Tek, it took 3 times as long as with my lever/handmade, and I would have died repeatedly without Sentinal and Serendipity. It's DPS is just too low against multiple mobs.
---
Against SB/SBQ/Squatch? You may as well just throw it at them, because you'll never have enough bolts to kill one.
---
The OVN event seems to be VERY random in the quality of enemies that spawn. I have only done it once where legendary enemies were spawning, and it was at an insane rate... Like every third ghoul was legendary. I don't think I have ever seen that another time.
---
Oh okay, had one was not sure about the rarity
---
Have to disagree..    
---
Their patch cycle is pretty impressive (however they need some help on version control and QA without question) and they have delivered on new content pretty regularly.   
---
There without question, is ground for legitimate criticism in many areas, but they are improving and most importantly, listening.
---
I remember having endless spawns early on and thinking the game bugged.  Super cool to know that feature still exists
---
I like the legendary script idea. Being able to make your own
---
Good post OP, could not agree moren
---
Prices must be good if they sell like that. I've bought up some fusion cores at 40, which is pretty good for 100%. I've also sold a lot of screws for 2-3 ea.
---
hey, I know this is a really old post but I still have that problem now. I already use DS by Unitymedia so this can't fix it for me unfortunatly. Any idea what to do?
---
If they can track these items they should roll out the complete list and put AVERAGE sale price they sold for. This would help most of us price things not legendary in our machines.
---
I once found a lvl 45 BE 50 cal for 750 caps. Ive also found flux for 15/ per stable. Bought the whole inventory and crawled home. I've found vendors that sell mats for 1-3 caps per single, yet priced bulk the same way. Probably thought it counted per piece lol. Also cleared out the inventory. The guy messaged and said thanks for your business. No no. Thank you!
---
Do nukes actually destroy CAMPs or just irradiated the area?
---
Dude you wrote a whole guide! You are the real MVP. Really appreciate the good work. :)
---
I've read on this sub a while ago, that explosive ammo is a pain in the ass to craft. Any experience in selling explosives a/o explosive ammo?
---
There isn't enough time to complete that event as it is. You want everyone to waste more time fast traveling to stash box before joining the event?
---
Actually nnot.  Due to a stash and carry weight ‚Äúintervention‚Äù I was the focus of a coupe months back, I‚Äôve actually been quite happy with 800 lbs.  
---
...until player vending.  
---
If they are going to change the platform with new content that directly relates to stash space, then they should be prepared to adjust said stash space by at least the amount the all-knowing, all-seeing gods calculate necessary (extra 50 lbs?  100? 200?)
---
To think stash space wouldn‚Äôt come up again when they add content directly related to it, is just ignorant.
---
Honestly, not many, and the ones that I would like to see are minor.   
---
More building options. I personally suggested a greenhouse that we could lock to keep other players out and that allows us to grow other plants rather than just our standard crops. Allow us to set it to a climate so we can't grow plants from different biomes together.   
---
Event mechanics/boss fights. I saw someone complain that they lost an event and missed out on the loot because everyone else was worried about getting the most damage they could to the boss so that they could get better loot. Everyone on the post suggested that everyone should get loot no matter what they do, which basically means they are asking for free /easy loot. I suggested they make no changes and that people just need to get smarter and work together, or that Bethesda tweek the mechanics to force more people to focus on completing the event, (like protecting the animals in Arktos, rather than just damaging the boss) and tweek the mechanics so that you focus on one objective of the event, then the other, so on and so forth.   
---
To leave the perk system completely alone, or offer a permanent perk build system (with a costly respec at certain locations) that allows you to focus with a little more diversity. The people that have been typically complaining about the perk system are the people that want the meta DPS build but don't understand why they can't also provide the same utility, medic capability, and defense of others (people that want their characters to be gods, rather than unique).  
---
A complete survival revamp, with its own features/characters separate from adventure mode. Give us three month seasons. Every month and a half make us start from scratch, BUT keep plans and recipes. Drop the stash size down to 400 again, but keep it protected loot, while giving us other boxes we can craft (each box with its own loot limit) that isnt protected and can be raided. I want people to attack my base and me attack theirs, and I want there to be a reward for it. CAMP defense is weak right now. Monsters only attack it if you travel to it and they spawn, so you can defend it yourself. Give me a reason to make a fortress. Its in BETA so it is completely okay for me to express my unbiased opinion on it.  
---
The thing is, I'm not demanding anything from Bethesda like a lot of the popular suggestions are (yes, they are demanding even if they say please Bethesda). They're going to quit if they don't get their way, they've been doing it for five months now. The rest of us are content with the game, and just want to see content rather than game changes (and if we do, they are very, very minor and not many), and many want to see quality of life changes as content, such as the greenhouse. It is its own feature, that allows me to grow crops I'd otherwise have to spend a long time finding. It doesn't have to be OP, and allow me to get endless bloodleaves on demand, but being able to get a little (like a junk extractor in my camp) every so often would be a cool feature and also considered QOL.
---
Ehhhh they have the Croquette mallet and a modded sledgehammer beats out a modded Super-sledge so they do have at least *one* top tier item
---
How? Because when you swing they sometimes don't do damage?
---
What‚Äôs the worst?
---
Yeah I saw that too lol.
---
I'm a melee build - but I've given 3 points in rifle for ignoring armor + tank killer 1. 
---
I haven't figured out whats "best" either, so I carry lots of different weapons.....which is one reason why I have a lot of excess weight....
---
"Next best" depends on what you are shooting at/where you are.
---
I've been using an Executioners combat rifle (45 cal).  Takes about 200 rounds to kill L50 SBs and entourage of scorched - if it's only one SB at a time.   Executioners has made pretty short work on most critters in the western and center of the map, but not so much in the mire.  First Hermit crab I met just giggled at me before I died.  Got my revenge with an AA LMG (308).
---
Also found the Executioners to be totally inadequate when I was triple teamed by L65 SBs last weekend.
---
OTOH....
---
Made my 2nd visit to Watoga last night - caught in the train car between the station and the wood tower by an L80 SB + a couple of L24 Assaultrons.
---
1\* Troubleshooters Gatling (5mm) made short work of the Assaultrons, alternated between that and a 1\* AA LMG (308) on the SB.
---
Along comes another SB, this one a L50 - Tried out 3\* resolute veteran (99 dmg), then the Executioners combat rifle.  Worked well.
---
50 cal recon sniper was great for all the robots at Dyer chem, especially the robobrains hiding in the smokescreen.
---
3* Exterminator‚Äôs Shovel?
---
A 3* troubleshooter lead pipe ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I see them often enough. My luck is 14, not sure if there is a coorelation.
---
Sounds like it's time for them to cool it on the content and throw that bug fix into warp drive.
---
My drive is learning every plan in the game. Dunno yet what I'll do after. :)
---
I want separate beards and 'staches.
---
Lemme mix and match.
---
Legendary loot and rare items as event rewards would be so much better.
---
I made my camp very close to the blooms. You can see them glowing at night
---
I just want the silver handmade and the fixer skin available in the atomic shop. Skins protect weapons from being dropped/sold/scripped and we need more of them
---
I'm a rifle build as well. I run a vampire lever action as my main walking around skirmish gun.
---
Then I picked up a sweet anti armour combat rifle not set to auto I use that for decent fights and to ease up on my 5.56 ammo. Then I have a TSE handmade for the really big things. I crouch get in close and lay down as many rounds as I can while still hidden or cautious for that extra sneak damage. Most things die fast and what don't does pretty quick after they spot me.
---
I wouldn't mind a good anti armour hunting rifle or swap my vampire lever action for a better one like anti armour.
---
I think the right radium rifle or an instigating dragon could be fun too.
---
Ugh... did you delete all your old photoss to make room? You didn't need to do that... photos for challenges will count towards challenges regardless of wether or not you have room available in your gallery.
---
Neat... I should start taking notes :) Thank you!
---
Ouch.  That is bad.
---
That is the exact spot my base is built on, been thinking of moving it cause being at watago isnt as useful as it used to be, but I hate giving up my floating foundations so I dont have to build stair cases from the ground up.
---
I cripple the alpha's legs with a shotgun and frost'em with a cryolator, then it's easy
---
Yes, thank you for the correction. It's an impressive number considering the maximum amount of scrip people could have obtained in the time allotted was roughly 2100. Which would make it roughly 21,000 individual transactions.
---
Watoga was clearly broken because after you finished the Mayor quest, the robots become passive to you. It was literally endless spawns of non-aggressive legendaries. In this case, you at least have to fight level-appropriate enemies.
---
But hey, go decimate that Sheepsquatch imposters now...  üò≥
---
I‚Äôve been server hopping and station hopping to no avail. Wonder if Beth pulled them from the vendors when they added the scout challenges?
---
Yea ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è all I want is a 2 handed bloodied weapon with swing speed and +1 strength üò§üò§
---
Delay, delay, delay
---
Then hope they forget about it
---
In a "disarmed" type of sense?
---
He's not using a new name, we fought him a couple nights ago again.  He seems to have gotten a few lackies that are also using the ESP/Auto-Aim/NoClip cheats.  If you're on a team that works well together at concentrated fire he's easy to kill (when not hiding inside rocks or under the WS hotel).
---
What would you call a reasonable price for Aluminum?
---
As a heavily bearded dude, lemme say this...
---
putting a mask on my bearded face... looks *anything* but bad-ass. it ends up looking like a bandaid on a bear's ass.
---
I don't even do that event anymore. It's all about project paradise dude!
---
...welp, guess I'm a cannibal now.
---
I can concur that is the case.
---
Baseball bat has loads of mods including several skins.
---
I have 4 machines set up. Only reason why I'm not moving at the moment myself.
---
Do you use any mods or a custom.ini?
---
You're welcome. I just sold two more legendaries since we've been messaging so I don't think whoever said legendary trade was dead was right.
---
Someone literally just made this same post 15 minutes ago.
---
Not sure why you downvoted, I am giving you my insight on a Heavy Weapon build that I have been using since the BETA.
---
Explosive Heavy Weapons apparently do not work with Anti-Armor effects so using Stabilized will give you give you the accuracy bonus.  I cannot confirm it myself as my only Explosive Heavy Weapon at the time is a Suppressors MG42.  I will have to test that against another MG42.  And trust me, using Explosive Heavy Weapons does not give you an edge in terms of damage by crazy amounts.  I strongly recommend using either Bloodied or Anti-Armor Weapons.  My main weapon is a Bloodied .50 Cal. and I just do more damage to more health I lose.  I do not maintain health at 20% constantly as that really only works with Stealth builds.
---
And if you need Fireproof on while using Explosive Weapons, you are using that gun type wrong.  That is better suited for PvP.  In PvE, just run away and gain some distance.  However, if you are keen on using it, use it with Rejuvenated as your Endurance perks.
---
Good Doggy is a gimmick and useless perk.  You get no benefit from eating dog food other than it satiates you more.  I highly recommend you get Rejuvenated.  You get +50 Health and AP by being well fed which is easy to maintain.  Speed Demon makes it more tedious though.
---
That got patched out many patches ago.
---
I like Gunsmith too.  I always use it.  I just would not use Gunsmith and Demolition Expert at the same time unless I was using proper Explosive Weapons like the Missile Launcher but they suck.  I personally have 11 points into Intelligence for Gunsmith, Batteries Included, and Stabilized.  If you really want you could use a Rank 3 Gunsmith for a bit more durability but I recommend allocating those 3 points elsewhere.  I use One Gun Army to stagger things like Gulpers and Deathclaws so you could if you want.  I heard that with a Cryolator helps with big bosses.
---
Travel Agent was a personal suggestion.  I prefer saving Caps when I can.  It is preference really.
---
Yes and combined with Adrenaline stacks you can kill most things with a couple of shots.  Glow Sight also works nice with this as most Glowing enemies are quite tanky.  You will see how easy it is to kill things in Project Paradise.  
---
Take my advice however you wish.  I suggest you check out Captainoob on YouTube.  He tests out weapons of every variety.  My build is quite similar to his Heavy Weapon build and he demonstrates how effective it can be without an explosive weapon.
---
But you had to kill off the robots for more to spawn, otherwise you'd only get like one or two legendaries and then they'd all be normals.
---
Yup! I'd happily take a significant delay in the release of content if it means they can get things stabilized and some bugs fixed.
---
3 \* AA handmade was the best thing ive pulled. Done about 25 purchases
---
Yeah but it still doesn't beat out either sledge for damage
---
That would be defuse
---
That's the only thing on the list that I don't sell, and that's simply because they weigh too much to be worth my Vendor space.
---
Poison if for armor reduction, not for damage
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more with you 
---
2 Bethesda employees:
---
What bugs are we fixing first ?
---
Anything that gives players freebies , and make sure you guys break half of the atoms challenges to encourage whales to open their wallets
---
Bloodied explosive. What's the point in deleting a comment where you explain what BE means though?
---
I‚Äôve gotten a Vampire/faster fire handmade and a bolstering/+1 agility scout chest piece.
---
You talked me into it!
---
I like that idea of being able to have more utility in your camp. How do you feel about being able to select which events you get notified about?
---
PC? Mods? If yes update the custom.ini
---
If no, probably contact support
---
oh no ! not again.
---
thx for the heads up tho.
---
IKR THIS HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME ALOT SINCE EVERYTIME I START IT NO ONE JOINSüò§üò§üò§
---
this is pretty cool
---
resippie
---
3* Exterminator Laser Pistol...which I thought may be awesome....it's not. Maybe my build isn't right for it, but it did nothing.  But I'll keep grinding!!!!  It's quite a thrill much like slot machines... someday I'll win the jackpot.
---
3* wooden left leg...
---
I have trouble believing there have been 2 million Imposter SS kills, since *I've* never seen it done.
---
Also haven't seen the tourist camera. What's that about?
---
Scrapped plenty of legendaries, though!
---
Having Same problem.
---
 I have all the ones I want, except that fucking Dense mod. ;)
---
And none of those mods really affect the base appearance of the bat itself.  They're just attachments.  Many weapon mods change the base appearance of the weapon.
---
I‚Äôve only exchanged 7 weapons so far 
---
On the top was an anti armor Gatling plasma and executioners Gatling lazer...
---
And a scorched killer handmade , thinking about this one heavily as it could potentially turn good , but I‚Äôm a full demo guy so the tse or just anything with an explosive round it‚Äôs already heaven to me
---
Yes you should, heal that mutation right away and buy atoms from Bethesda to make up for it!
---
And while you‚Äôre at it, break 1/3 of the weapons in game and make them uncompetitive.
---
Also take topiaries out!
---
I need answers for this
---
How'd you get it so tol? My base is on a bloody cliff and I swear I barely get 4 stories of vertical room.
---
But it's a croquette mallet.  Lol.
---
Thanks for sharing to everyone, now its going to me nerfed.
---
Same problem here, PC, Europe.
---
Probably 2* Furious, Faster fire Minigun
---
Half of the skins change the look of the item completely.  Not sure what you mean regarding mods?  The wiffle bat skin completely covers anything else you have on the item.  Seems to me a skin would be easier to make than all the different item models for mods.  Idk.
---
Agreed!
---
Well, no but it does go further to show it's not just weapons with no mods.
---
With the wifflebat skin it does beat the sledge for entertainment :)
---
That‚Äôs what a vendorbot pays if I have maxed hard bargain and grape mentats.
---
They need to hire qa testers earlier I used to post my bugs but figure I was doing their job for free, so now I just stay quit and don‚Äôt give a crap

Almost every sub for online games in recovery have toxic people, I‚Äôd say this sub isn‚Äôt really that bad, just look at r/StarWarsBattlefront  or r/SeaOfThieves. Those games are really getting better after all this time and there‚Äôs still tons of toxic people, were pretty chill in comparison.

Nukes destroy camps. Entirely.
---
Seriously? I got one from the turning in data 2 weeks ago, but just bought the initiate paint from a vendor last night.
---
I've been pricing them at 50 or so, and they go immediately.  100 is probably reasonable.
---
They could make weapon skins that visually "override" the mods that are attached to the weapon, I suppose.
---
Does the plan normally spawn there? Like a static spawn as in if nobody's picked it up yet it'll be there in a certain spot
---
A skin doesn't protect a weapon from Being dropped/sold/scripped.
---
They never respond to this, I see these posts weekly. 
---
Light wood laminate!
---
I feel that the combined effects of 'latest game' players moving on to other games and the pvp tryhards moving into survival mode have made survival mode much, much friendlier than it used to be.
---
I bought it, the clean clown outfit, and the medical smiley mask for a cannibal clown character I was working on. It was good fun for a while. I just like to change playstyles a lot. My character has been many things
---
One gun is most valuable in PVE, heavy weapons and power armor only get you killed quicker in PVP üòâ
---
Yeah im having the same issue, no idea why
---
This sounds great. I stuck around a few times and there's always that one guy who melees you to trigger PvP off your defensive mutations, kills you, then takes your stable flux. Lol. I usually leave immediately after and dump my junk. But then I could come back for the foto!
---
For me, game balance should be more of a concern in PvP than PvE. 
---
When game balance is out of hand in PvP, competition is blown out. I mean go to survival and try playing as a melee character right now, you‚Äôll notice a distinct disadvantage.  And yeah melee can be powerful in PvE but really so is every gun too. Ammo is very cheap, and you can light up an entire horde of enemies with a gun and kill them all in a single clip no problem. Enemies in PvE are generally pretty squishy.
---
And maybe so about the repair costs for most melee weapons when stacked up against ballistics, but ranged users, I believe, have to use less healing items because they‚Äôre at range.
---
Don't stop with just one.
---
Upvoted for visibility
---
Most of the people still have duped weapons and armors. Its hard to sell any legendaries to anyone.
---
It looked like a pipneer scout paint but it was propably this so thank you!
---
I agree, I bought the wiffle bat skin when it was on sale. It's gonna go great with the clown outfit once I find a good bat. I was using the Croquette hammer for my cannibal clown but that's gonna go way better
---
Any of the event-derived plans seem to go pretty quick.  The Free Range plans for Sheepsquatch-related items rarely stay in my inventory very long.
---
I assume people want the plans, but don't want the hassle of grinding for them.  A nominal amount of caps is a fair trade-off.
---
I wish you could price items on a scale, say, volume discounts.   That‚Äôs what was or is nice about trading directly with players.  Can‚Äôt really do that with player vending - or at least not in a way that‚Äôs easy or convenient.
---
Takes few seconds to go to camp just go to camp
---
The amount of things to do. Exploring, taking in the lore from listening to holotapes and reading notes/terminals, building your C.A.M.P., taking workshops, doing Quests and Events, PvPing... so much to do and so little time to do it all! I loved FO4 and honestly I like FO76 even better for what it improved on, despite the bugs and rough start. 
---
Personal and probably unpopular opinion, but I felt the meh dialogue options with NPCs and forced family narrative on your character in FO4 took away from the experience so I was totally fine with those aspects being absent in FO76.
---
I like the bulk idea. I think anything beyond 1 Cap is too much as well unless it‚Äôs highly desired ammo like 5.56
---
Exactly.   
---
They can down vote me all they want, they can say that I am the one that is crying, or that my opinion is my own. The truth is, we have had to listen to them complain and cry for six months that they want a single player Fallout experience in this multiplayer Fallout game; they want their characters to be able to do absolutely everything easier, its not enough that they can already do everything with the only penalty being some minor inconveniences.   
---
The system is currently easy enough, any more MAJOR QOL (stress on major), and this game will be ruined. From challenging survival game to uninstalled streamlined easy garbage. If I want a character that can do absolutely everything, then I'll play 3, New Vegas, or 4. If I want surviving to be made easier, I'll again play survival mode on one of the older Fallout games.  I enjoy the uniqueness my friends bring to the team (be it lock picking, cheaper traveling, bartering, different kinds of damage, etc) and I like that I can change my uniqueness at the cost of a little time while still being completely unique.    
---
Batman has to go back to the Batcave and prepare for different encounters. It takes him some time, but not a lot. If he doesn't have the tool for it, he has to buy it, make it, or find it like we do. He doesn't ask "god" to just give it to him for showing up and fighting crime.
---
Keeps you warm and toasty.
---
I finally received my first, the knight(?) PA paint two weeks ago without ever getting the initiate first. I just bought the initiate paint from a vendor last night.
---
Ya, similar to the new power armor skins they have been releasing lately.
---
Yes it does, skins prevent the weapon from being sold or scripped, if you attempt to drop it the game gives you a prompt
---
As of 8 days ago it seems it came from the dev room. That or theres a group that modded in the paint from fallout 4 and they made a very limited amount of them that are still floating around. Both are possible since its pc. Theres not much info on it
---
Yeah I bought the fixer plan on a lark for 2500, it's actually a surprisingly good weapon, crafted legendary done right
---
My apartment in reality is a millennial Instagram hellscape of plants and I have somehow managed to make my in game house equally peak millennial. I have plants in every room - if they make any more I‚Äôm gonna have to start tearing things down to get more plant building budget.
---
I love seeing near people come out of the vault, i I often go and craft them a low level set of armor to grow into, drop some .38 ammo and some stims. 
---
I also when bored like watching for defend workshop events and helping or if they don't show up defending workshops for people.
---
Or just tagging along with some random stranger helping. Or just being goofy and following them.
---
I had and do have many being nice to me and see them being nice to others I just like paying it forward. This game has lead to some funny spontaneous moments between myself and strangers.
---
I just love the noise it makes when you hit something. Doink!
---
Yeah. I am lvl 136 and still run 1* weapons. The right 1* beats a random 3* all day.
---
Same problem here
---
&gt;don't sell ‚≠ê items
---
Caveat: certain ones- like bloodied or vampiric- do sell quite well at one star. I seek and place bloodied and sell them fast. Vampiric, in the right weapon (High speed- minigun, gatling, cultist dagger, smg, etc) also goes fast. I get around 1000 caps each for these. Way better return than scrip and gamble for another throwaway 2 or 3 star.
---
I have not found any 1 star armor anyone wants.
---
Hmm. Idk but I totally want there to be a scorched vendor and ghoul vendor. Idk why but I think it would be cool to have them walk around like Grahm. Maybe one with a rad roach and one with a wild tick.
---
I'm having the problem and I'm on PS4
---
Ummm, you do realize that the skin isn't permanent, and is removed just as easily as it's put on. It changes nothing.
---
Or... you can just look at your camp vending machine as an occasional bonus rather than a main source of income. I'm not going to move my camp for business purposes because it's more important to have a steady supply of acid so I can make ammo. 
---
A lot of people I play with  have been complaining more about  low  ammo, stimpaks etc.  and broken weapons since the vendor thing started. Probably because they  spend more time worrying about  vending  bullshit  than they do about farming materials to craft and repair stuff and make ammo.
---
How much do you set plans for? I have jet pack plans for sale for 1000 caps but nobody bites. Is that too much? 
---
I don‚Äôt really know how to price my extras
---
You can build down just as much as you can build up. All you need to do it when you first place your CAMP make sure you place it somewhere around 2-3 stories higher than the ground, you can go higher but you will have less build area width at ground level. The building zone is a Sphere.
---
This one is close to impossible as even if you find someone to team up and successfully hunt down the flatwoods monster while wearing spacesuits the camera is so short range and bad a recognising moving subjects that it probably won't even register.
---
Wow, you are like a walking, talking anti-Bethesda propaganda machine, aren't you?  I understand that the game isn't for everyone and I understand that there are still bugs in it, but each and every comment in your history is about how people should just give up on the game, how Bethesda is only out to screw the players, yadda yadda yadda. Not to mention that your only original post was stating what a masterpiece FO76 would be if it had been an Ubisoft game.
---
Seriously, your history reads like a thinly disguised PR-smear campaign.
---
luck 2 , seen 3, despatched 2,  oh,and they can't half fight back, died 3
---
they suck don't even bother with them. specially on the laser gatling gun
---
Thanks for the input üëç
---
To be fair, I've accidently killed supervisors in UF. And of course there's no I'm Sorry emote...
---
Even my weakest weapon can one hit the supervisors if I have adrenaline going and I kill a couple of the miners first. So now I try to perk down and such if there are other players. Plenty of time to unequip cards in that event
---
Same problem here, PS4
---
Eat them if you don't have stimpaks.
---
Sounds good. Thank you!
---
Hmm.  That‚Äôs good. I was under the impression you ‚Äúfound‚Äù them in order, and could not proceed without knowing Initiate, based on the experiences of others.  I am very glad to be wrong.
---
You should do a little experiment, apply a skin to a weapon and go to a vendor bot and see if it appears in the trade window. After that, go to the scrip machine and see if it appears in that window.
---
What is worth more than 25K caps?  Honestly?
---
If you already know it, and re-buy it from the vending machine, do you get the plan itself?
---
So much stuff lol that's a nice setup
---
Yeah, absolutely.   
---
That is a minor QOL change that I mentioned above. It doesn't change the system, it doesn't break the game, and it doesn't take away from our characters or gameplay. It is a huge difference between that type of QOL and making bosses always drop loot for everyone for showing up, and allowing us to be a "god" character build, doing max DPS as well as having all the utility perks.
---
Maybe it's just the luck of the draw, but I've seen them in about thirty percent of the shops I visit.
---
For what it's worth, I don't think there's much demand for a lot of them.  Marsupial, sure.  Maybe two or three others.
---
if it is atomic store it does. you cant sell atomic store items to or in vendors.
---
It's permanent if you leave it on?
---
Yeah once I get the caps that‚Äôs probably what I will do. Thanks!
---
Awesome, I will be checking that out for sure. Thanks.
---
Yes that's what we are all talking about.
---
I have a few maps so I will do that. Thanks.
---
You raise a good point, but I am pretty sure that since this is not a cosmetic change and actually a gameplay affecting change, it's banned. This seems very possible and easy to do, but is cheating and I am 100% sure Bethesda will ban users of that method. Permanent bans.
---
Il always do damage then drag it to other or emote to follow me before i kill. I give ppl a chance but im not gonna let a legendary kill me if ppl take forever
---
I have a few so I will do that. Thanks.
---
Right but you have to take it off before sell, trade, or scrip it
---
I have weapons with skins on them, all I have to do is remove the skin and I can do whatever I want to with it. You must be referring to doing any of those things by accident.
---
What test subjects? Where? Shit's flying everywhere and the place is a fucking maze. But you're right, that one's not that bad, it's the other events that are worse.
---
That is the one category of sales items that people collect or are willing to pay more for.  Some people obsess or will pay huge amounts of caps for some apparel.  Not my cup of tea but I get it.
---
&gt; Why grind for hours if your going to sell the spoils of your work for pennies.
---
You assume a grind. I sell whatever I don't want from my regular play sessions. I stop by vendors and buy cheap stuff when I am wandering near them to suppliment my store. I do not grind, and have no interest in doing so. The closest I get to a grind is I will run Uranium Fever any time it is up. The junk, weapons to sell, and legendaries you get are way worth a 10 minute side trip. A stack of 40 mole miner gauntlets is 600 caps at a vendor.
---
Perfect! Thanks!
---
Right. They completely added the new one way up in the northwest corner. I imagine it's not too difficult to add new vaults all over considering how huge the map is.  They could honestly have about an infinite number of vaults if they want.
---
Nah, I had to whack a dozen RoboBrain.
---
Yeah I have to work on getting some more caps. Thank you. I‚Äôll keep at it.
---
Most plans have set spawn points, but the point cycles through a multitude of different plans. So if the player was looking for the Tesla rifle plans there, it's likely a known spawn point for that plan, but can also be a hundred other plans when you arrive to the spawn location.
---
I'm more worried that my turning in technical data was bugged, and I won't receive any more. :/
---
Huh, must be server side issues. Works fine for me on PC
---
Bunch of snobs.
---
Tried to verify last night but yeah, some rando hero burst in to save the day.
---
Well sorry about that. We now learned that we can‚Äôt either drop thw camera or it will destroy it. And you can‚Äôt trade it either. That sucked.  Sorry to have waisted your time. Btw I never found the damn body. Only place I disn‚Äôt have time to go look was wagota and freddy‚Äôs
---
I love that gun.  It's definitely worth it for a stealthy build, and the plans are a pretty rare drop from Encryptid.
---
I‚Äôm referring to standard weapon type mods.  Agree on some armor mods or plans I charge quite a bit more for those.
---
I‚Äôve never sold 40mm and I had it at 1 Cap. I ended up just giving it away for free.
---
It's one of the advanced power connectors. 
---
It acts as a switch but with a during-placement-randomly-generated code. You can't set it - it tells you the code and you gotta remember.
---
That I would enjoy. See if you have a good reason for people to come there, like the teddy bear theme or a kickass camp build, then it's worth the caps to travel there
---
I lock one. Certain recipies need a steady flow of purified. If its unlocked, its all yours. I will put away the 5 from my locked one for my own use.
---
I think that's how many people have died to it
---
So I'm having issues with the chemist to get the syringer shot to count. Any tips? 
---
I'm also having issues trying to get a cargobot picture. Soon as I get into range it zips off and let me tell ya, that's tough to get in range of a cargo bot. Any tips?
---
I enjoyed it. great work on the video.
---
Now attempt the other one , the one involving an alien hahaha
---
try doing the possum challenge for a cargotbot.
---
Would you be willing to help with some other stuff? Because I have this issue where I'm terrified of most aspects of the game, but I want to not be leveling up at the speed of a snail. So I need help finishing the quests and discovering stuff.
---
Thank you, if new walls are added I'll throw down my money so fast
---
üò≥. Damn!  What was the third perk?
---
Agree! And from a roleplaying standpoint i think 76 is better because its a straight clean slate, no back story to build off of, it can be anything you want!
---
I think it was anti armor and the 2 vats perks
---
I saw a guy today that had his fusion cores for 200+ each.  It was like WTF dude. 
---
If it‚Äôs 100% charged I‚Äôve sold several in the 80-100 range.  For 75% charge or less I‚Äôve priced less, ie 50.
---
Yeah I'd  like to see it for free range too. I barely get other to join when I start it
---
There are a few set spawn points that only spawn one plan. I was more or less asking if this was one of those spots
---
I've only seen the flatwoods monster once and that's the only alien I know and idk how to make him come out
---
Yeah, my 5.56 went fast, I held 1000 remaining in my STASH, but sold the additional 2k+ that I had.  I needed the space more than the ammo for a weapon I don't use currently.  Other ammo hasn't sold as well but time to time gets chipped away.
---
maybe my spacesuits will finally start selling lol
---
Kk thanks
---
That Robinson, is something I will not argue with you about.  
---
They need to focus on both equally but separately. That is simply why survival mode just needs to be its own system with its own unique rules rather than just adventure mode with with pvp rules slapped on it.   
---
The only say goes, don't bring a knife to a gun fight. You'll always be at a disadvantage in pvp with melee over ranged, its just common sense. And if they make it too strong to balance the game play, it will be the only thing that is used in pvp. They need to strengthen it, but they can't put it at the same level as ranged users. It wouldn't be an issue if we had separate characters for survival though. We could focus on ranged, with melee as a secondary perk build.
---
I think the killing blow has to be with the syringer. I've heard on this subreddit that bashing works too.
---
For the cargobot, call in a drop with the Government Supply holotape, or run the Collision Course event at Morgantown Airport.
---
OH F\*\*\* I tried storing the cat and I was able to replace. . . so I told people they could store it.
---
I will not tell anyone that again.
---
I misunderstood the meaning of your post. I agree with needing more though, I want a patriot skin for my super sledge!
---
Perks?
---
The 50 cal ball I price at 2.
---
Would it be possible to move your CAMP into the area and build a jail of walls around the horde boss so it doesnt die?
---
You can‚Äôt fast travel to camp when overencumbered.
---
I like limb damage in things. My shotgunner got an AA with limb damage. Almost guaranteed to cripple on every shot. Its almost a cheat. I wish it was reduced weight as well, but nothing is perfect.
---
Ok thanks!
---
I hate this bug. It's been driving me nuts forever. Sometimes you can remove EVERY piece that's touching the stairs--walls and stuff--but most often I've found if I really want them gone and they're bugging me that much the best option is to pack-up your camp, place it back down and start over with your build. Worst option ever, I know... but it's the only thing I've found that gets rid of them. I REALLY wish they would fix that buggy crap. :/
---
That's an interesting point. I'll have to start paying attention to those camps and see if it's true.
---
Go to Morgantown airport and do the Collision Course event.  After the final low level Scorched wave (there's 5), a cargo bot will drop the supply box.üòÅ
---
Not sure about 40mm and missiles, since this started I have kept all of my ammo free (of course except the ones I use) and no one has gotten those two even for free. 
---
And usually people are nice and only pick up the free ammo for the stuff they use, but sometimes they seem to pick up pretty much all other ammo but still 40mm or missiles are not good enough.
---
I have sold other gear semi-OK at least so it's not like anyone is visiting me.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understand what lore means.
---
Most of this seems like common sense. Also with the legendary script thing, I'm not totally sure it's worth it just yet. Just because somethings a one star doesn't mean it's worthless. I'd take my Bloodied Shotgun over my a TSE variant. I only sell things I'd actually use, but have an abundance of. At this point I'm not too concerned with selling a lot I just want to help others and break even or a little profit.
---
I don't remember I think it was less damage from bugs and 2 others.... It wasn't good all I remember and grinded it instantly
---
"But I want to sell my useless 1* legendaries for 3000 caps each!" - Vendor Johnny
---
"I'm gonna stop you right there" - ~~Vault-Tec Rep~~ OP probably
---
Absolutely I'll help with anything!!!
---
The levelling up of weapons probably won't happen. Seems like it's the only way to nullify all the duped guns from the previous waves of exploits. Guessing we'll see higher level guns but not until they feel it safe to do so.
---
the [50.cal](https://50.cal) on s/b works a treat if you pick the shot. l55 s/b - 25 rounds. bog standard and without any b/mess etc. s/b's are armoured to hell and back,but the refined 50 or hardened,peircing 308 blows right thru it.
---
No one wants my instigating rifles. I thought they would, but they have sat in the vendor at 500 for weeks with many people shopping- my shop is right next to whitesprings train station. I finally turned them to scrip.
---
Sounds like nice people. I'm on ps4 if you need any help
---
Find me one person who would buy the ashtray plans fir 100 caps
---
best thing ive heard all day, did u eat him with some fava beans and a nice chianti?
---
Yo! I can only repeat that u should upgrade to full DS (with IPv4 and IPv6). That solved the problem for me.
---
When viewing your challenges you'll have a button listed at the bottom to track the challenge. You'll receive a pop-up on screen when completing a portion of it. Helps a little, but not much because I still find it necessary to view the challenge to see what is next.
---
Are you folks on PC? I'd love to join or if not how can I donate?
---
Is there a list of what you need? I'm level 195. Always giving away stuff. Wandering around to help others.
---
Just sold a TSE Lever Action for 7,500 caps. Sold a few serums for 399-599 caps. Sold a few rounds for a cap a piece. My plans don't sell worth shit I just give them away.
---
I completed that one, I did the collision course event at morgantown airport and photographed the cargobot as it dropped the crate after the event finished.
---
Doesn't mean they should dude. Why do you even care? You dont play
---
I thought the meta for PvP now, was stealth boys and ground shooting tesla rifles, or glitchy explosive lasers with unlimited range?
---
Just a regular spacesuit, not a clean one? Come on, devs, these things are supposed to be challenging.
---
WA dlc was supposed to come with junk decoration at CAMPs. Is that still happening?
---
I use the ritual mask. I like is better because it‚Äôs just so fucking unsettling
---
Go to Hornwright HQ in Charleston. Once you enter, take the stairs up to Level 5. Enter the room adjacent to the stairs, and you should see a board on an easel with something about possum sign ups on it.
---
For some reason my brain really wants to read this as *2 Fast 2 Furious Minigun.*
---
i like that, ive always been of the opinion of needing a large judges gavel skin for the super sledge so i can name it Ban Hammer
---
&gt; the tags I did to the ISS before it's shield gone down didn't count! And between death and respawn, it lowered its shields, and (strangely enough) got killed before I could go back there and get my "tag" (the one with lowered shields, as I did attack it before that phase)
---

---
&gt;Bethesda doesn't fully grasp the in game balance and combos
---
Nobody at Bethesda is truly playing the game.
---
agreed
---
I don't know who's buying ammo for 2 caps but if you are you're doing it wrong. IDC if it's 5.56.
---
That's straight money
---
We work multi platform so yeah you can do both. You can join here [https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzWjxO1ezE?i=VmMp8q9d](https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzWjxO1ezE?i=VmMp8q9d) if you want our discord ask but you have to go through this first sry for the trouble
---
It's not in the game itself it's for doing a cheap mints in the game and collecting them all
---
The cult with the punch bowl was such a nice touch.
---
I've also noticed enemies lately just kind of running away from me and then just chilling. Seems new.
---
That would be pretty damn awesome!
---
I read a comment somewhere that someone can still do it using the posts in the stairs section, am fiddling to see if I can replicate it!
---
This
---
Depends..
---
If it's a recipe you only get from quests like Biv, Scouts, or such I sell at a higher value because it's scarcer.  Biv recipes 200-300, except Nuka Dark which I usually list 1.5k.  Scouts 500 caps usually for things like the taxidermy mounts etc.
---
Plans for PA mods, less than what the vendors sell for, half as much or lower.  I haven't sold many of them, I imagine a lot of people already have them anyway or have build their PA and don't need more mods.  I hope newer players who show up will go for those as the game matures.
---
Any other recipe, unless it's ultra common, usually whatever the game recommends.  If it's ultra common stuff I usually dump it in a bag or the dead body at Vault 76 entrance.
---
I mean true but you can mass produce those and get a bunch of caps in a short burst if you sell them to vendors.
---
Sure it's not the military paint in the enclave vendor?
---
They do play the game, but I would agree they don't play it "like we do", min-maxing the hell out of everything.
---
The ones with the objective diamond that appears over them?
---
How much were they asking for it?
---
At risk of pissing a lot of people of... [this was my *first* roll...](https://imgur.com/a/n3LrL7s)
---
I am built on the mountain side and there is a ledge below my ledge. So I fell down there once or twice. So I thought f* it I'll just build up to my base instead of FT back up. So I did it &amp; it looked stupid. Tried to delete it and it just ain't happening. And its below my lower floor so it's not even near my 2nd story. Them mfs are still there. Didn't feel like rebuilding everything again. I tried server hopping, hard resetting my xbox, I almost uninstalled the game. Idk what to tell ya but if someone knows, I'd love to know too...
---
Was thinking the drum mag gave you 85 rounds.
---
Deposit 60 of the required component.
---
I put .30 up for 0, and the rest for 1. All found ammo that I do not use. I almost never have 5mm, .44, or shotgun ammo up, since I use that the most.
---
I always buy fusion cores, a good rule of thumb is one cap per charge percentage left.
---
To add to this, I think your wasting a point on Photosynthetic. With the healing factor mutation, you'll have all the health regen you need.
---
I think it's 60 to hit 3 of 3
---
Which type of alien? 
---
We can kill the Flatwoods monster for Credit, but photos don't work.
---
Now we have to do this wild goose chase again, or have they fixed it for this challenge at least?
---
 I have 4 but they are rare. ;)
---
400+ hr player, I still have never seen the Flatwoods monster.
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
My best is a quad explosive pipe revolver and an executioners explosive combat shotgun, worst was an exterminators vats hit chance and damage resistance whilst aiming pipe bolt rifle
---
Are you 4?
---
No need for this shit in here
---
they give you tadpole medals too
---
Not really down to stats. They're are some set cyrptid spawns around the map though. One is just behind the pumpkin house. It's not guaranteed you'll always get something, rare in fact, but hop there enough you get a mothman or flatwoods. There's one by the overseers camp too.
---
Oh crap! I'm forgetting whether buyers can see how full the core is. I sell one or more almost every session I play, but they're not always full (I don't sell any that are less than maybe 70% full, but still). I assumed buyers can see how full it is but I'm going to feel like a total jerk if not. I sell em for 15-30 caps though, depending on charge level, so at least I'm not a total monster.
---
"I believe" maybe they fixed it :)
---
That explains what happened to me yesterday. Ran into a Super Mutant Horde event solo and had a hell of a time fighting off 3 level 40 minigun toting Greenskins. Then a scorchbeast decided to join the fun and I got caught in a hail of 5mm and screeches. Respawned and ran back only to find *even more muties* and at higher levels too. Awesome.
---
No 6 sub t PewDiePie
---
lucky hahah
---
Haha yeah it did shoot pretty frickin fast so yeah pretty fast and furious
---
Is that Combat shotty 3*.  That‚Äôs a damn nice piece, if so.
---
I found a shop that had 100% cores for 50. I bought all 20 of them. Now I never take my armor off. I'd sleep in it if the system would allow it.
---
Does green thumb count with the radkelp?
---
Unless you have a singularly fragile but good weapon (two shot or dragon) you use for everything I would put the gunsmith points to another use.  I tend to use a variety of heavy weapons so the wear gets spread out, bu you might not play that way.  I would then move some INT points to luck and add One Gun Army.   Just my 2 caps.
---
I see that .45 sells a lot and 5.56 sells like crazy. Shotgun shells hardly ever sell for me so I just give them away. 10mm sells sometimes too but I wish there was a way to bulk price. 
---
Either way, I love this update because I‚Äôm not running out of ammo like before.
---
I feel the same way, I played for the first time since launch and ppl were helping me out as well. Its nice that ppl are working together.
---
I hope so? Now I'm worried I won't get anymore...
---
I've seen them at whitesprings and near watoga.
---
Wavy willards waterpark
---
i bought 50 for 25c yesterday
---
No idea but lots of people having the same issue.  Driving me nuts.
---
No
---
The unfortunate thing about that is, remove these bugs hampering melee, and they would be competitive in survival. 
---
But with a bug like this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnoe7a/i_captured_the_perfect_clip_showcasing_how/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
And now you can‚Äôt even attack jumping enemies. They stand no chance. 
---
I would be okay with rules and balance operating differently between survival and adventure, I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs entirely necessary.
---
Good thing you scrapped it before modding it or logging out. Wood armor with more than 1* is bugged right now where it'll revert to a 1* after modding or logging out/back in, so be sure to always trade in for scrip even if it appears to be a really good roll.
---
Rifle build is a little vague. Automatic? Semi automatic? Sniper? In general though, particularly for a non sneak build, I don't know that there are any legendary armor effects that will straight up increase rifle damage.
---
  Max level Assassin sentinel left arm today for 150 caps.
---
You bet.  Leader is a good one.  Sneak is decent.  Given my build explosive is very effective. Lock Picking?  Not so much
---
I'm pretty sure it has reduced weight
---
Well its most likely cause if more then 6 people go down there the odds of crashing to the dashboard go up 99%. üòÇüòÇ
---
Harpers ferry
---
Yep, that‚Äôs a keeper.
---
fucking duper!!! burn him!!! jokes aside i hope you had some cool things that were duped man :D
---
What‚Äôs boning people? I though this patch was pretty minor? Did I miss something?
---
That‚Äôs a good idea, all my recipes are known so I‚Äôll be doing that for sure. I try to give my .38 away for free but I never thought of giving it to other players. 
---
You got a point about the PA users. I went gung ho and bought jet pack plans for the T-51b for like 2500 when the vending came out but I should‚Äôve just waited :/.
---
Fissure prime, so long as you nuke more of the space to the north of the fissure.  You can get well over 200 with green thumb
---
It‚Äôs still very RNG, One Violent Night for instance sometimes spawn a couple legendary ghouls among the hoard, often times zero, no matter how long you wait. The key to this RNG game is staying on the good server as long as possible. Each server has a different pool of loot, if you see a couple of bloodied or anti armor in a row, don‚Äôt leave until you get disconnected.
---
Hmm ill check but i doubt ill be able to afford one since im struggling with caps
---
Everyone down vote for this childish post
---
Got it
---
The people banned for accessing the dev room, had the same thoughts...
---
well even though a lot of people debate on this as far as i experienced it chameleon effect does stack so i have 4 chameleon parts and am pretty much invisible
---
"Congratulations!" followed by immediate destruction.
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
I second harpers fairy. Make sure to get the farm the the east.
---
Mutations are the absolute best value in all vending.  I already have 8 of them, but getting marsupial or adrenal reaction for 200 or 300 caps is a steal.  
---
Hell, back in the day I paid $4K caps for my marsupial off the enclave vendor.  Crazy
---
Sorry I‚Äôm running non-automatic rifles. Running Lever Action at the moment.
---
He turned me on to something else. Still an event though
---
Honestly, I wish they'd included more of the Cryptid story holotapes, I loved listening to those. In general I tend to listen to audiobooks while working or playing games so having those actually pop up in the form of short radio-dramas was great!
---
Companions.
---
Same I need this backpack bad
---
You guys just became rockstars in this community! Great job and thank you.
---
Nah^it^^works^^^on^^^^mobile
---
agreed!!! :)
---
Do you get a wanted level?
---
True enough and that's fine but unless they have the area sounds turned down they should have still heard my request.  I get that not everyone wants to mic or talk.
---
dude u hade me at booze. im in. ill het u up when I get home.
---
Also, this is funny considering Sony just agreed to use Microsoft's technology for future projects. (Including game streaming)
---
Xbox sucks but Payson is set to use Xbox tech, lmao.

Thank you!

they did it!

just hover, chicks do that all the time
---
Yeah this would actually be nice. The free market doesn't really work if you have very limited market intelligence.
---
hey are u military? I saw ur handle, im former navy
---
That‚Äôs 100% correct.  I buy ammo constantly.  45, 556, shotgun shells.  If it‚Äôs 1 cap I will take your entire inventory.  With 25K caps to spend I can buy a lot of ammo and have no need for decent weapons or armor (have it already)
---
Nope none /s
---
I've noticed that it stacks too, but he did say for a non sneak build so I didn't bother mentioning it.
---
FWIW, my anecdotal experience has been than all weightless pieces with the chameleon mutation has been more effective.
---
great thanks
---
Man, not on my servers for fusion cores! Took me quite a while to finally sell some. I had 5 100% cores for 100 caps. I did finally move them last night, but I sold many other things for days first. For me, ammo is hot. I can't keep 10mm, shells, or 5mm in stock! I do brisk ballistic Bock, high voltage hefe and rad ant lager business. Granted I sell them for 10 caps and it doesn't make a lot of money, but, people buy them almost every day.
---
Somebody said putting mats down first helps
---
never thought of that
---
The perimeter of the event should dictate if you get credit at least for now. That gives everyone who is there credit for now. Then they can at lease make changes to see who participates and who doesn‚Äôt and fix the potential leeching issue. Would just be cool if the event itself was an overall mob ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù and each objective, trash mob killed etc counted as tagging.
---
Ya its bugging me lol
---
Okay "xxX!I\_Am\_Pei!Xxx", let see the pics of your artsy cottage with attached mini mart. Genuinely curious.
---
Same! Not 20 but 8 or something!
---
Really appreciate, we're hoping to give some justice to this wonderfull community!
---
Dies the hazmat, or PA still count as "naked"?
---
Well I may have to consider it then lol.
---
definitely, for example combat rifle, combat shotgun, assault rifle, laser rifle, etc can all be modded automatic
---
Better not mess with G.O.D.
---
Depending on your level/gear, I'd suggest the Golf Clubhouse in the Whitesprings resort, otherwise check the map for Horde events and AWOL Armaments over at the Robco Research Center. Oh and the West Tek Research Center is fun to clear too.
---
And maybe you‚Äôre right, still one-shot scenarios no?
---
For a non sneak attack build I am afraid the only way you are going to see weapon damage increases is with perks, weapon legendary effects, and drugs.
---
what's your anti virus program?
---
Unyielding for ap and hit chance. Not to mention highest carry weight, exp gained, an legendary spawn rate. Throw in 1 life saving or cloaking if ya want.
---
Exactly, this is all speculation as we don't really know how they are managing objects. I can only speak from my own experience from SQL databases.
---
I don't think weight reduction perks would add too much processing as you'd only have to do the check when an item is added or removed from the stash.
---
With weight reduction perks, they can allow us to add more of certain item types without allowing us to go crazy with the worst types. I suspect spoilable food items to be the worst because of the extra distinct spoil stats that are also recalculating over time, and the relative light weight allows you to have alot of these. Of course, they could just remove food spoilage on the stash and I'd be fine with that.
---
The 2 places that have been mentioned plus in Toxic Valley just under Wavy Willards.
---
I know i am usually on team chat 90% of the time and i can see the white name pop up but i can not hear area chat unless i switch to area or auto.. 
---
Ive done that since beta to get away from respiratory problem mouth breathers, wannabe pop star singers, kids cryin, and dogs barking. 
---
In team chat i hear no one in area.
---
Railway rifle with automatic receiver is your best friend. Quad Explosive is a great combo.
---
1.9M Deaths to Sheepsquatch. Seems low based on the fact that I account for at least 1,000 of them.
---
Thank you means a lot this is why I love this community
---
Definitely easy, I used to have the perk loadout mod after an update I just kept falling through the world. You can 100% exploit that to get to locations that are blocked off for now. Not that you can't already do that with power armor frame exploits or fast travel glitches
---
U trying to sell to purveyor or the legendary scrip machine that is right out side its door?
---
This is a constant issue with [u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_/). They never can do any QA before releasing anything. The game still has some pretty major issues.
---
I‚Äôve been lucky with plans, not so much with ammo and zero with guns (prior view stats fix).
---
Most of the basic rifles can be modded to allow for full auto. I've got two 2-Star explosive Assault Rifles that I've fully kitted out with auto fire and such.
---
I thought everyone knew this. It explains this at loading screens from time to time.
---
This is why they have pictures on the line in many restaurants, so things like this don't happen at the pass.
---
If fundamental problems remain with systems like the settlement mechanic, after having months to be addressed, then of course people are going to get less than civil. Frankly, I‚Äôm impressed that complaints have been so polite up until now.
---
Imagine if they added selling data to the personal terminal, that would be awesome!
---
Personally I find the area around Mama Dolces rich in Violet and if you nail the town too that is a lot of blouted ghouls.
---
Hmm..interesting. I do use a Two-Shot .50 Cal so I will burn through my condition super quick, that‚Äôs why I put gunsmith rank 5.
---
Seriously, I would buy them from you.
---
Wrong server and wrong vendors/costumers, happens all the time! :(
---
Damn nice first roll!
---
From what others say it can spawn in MANY different places, albeit unbelievably rare. Good luck to ya!
---
But you swapping out lock picking and hacking perks as needed is exactly how my character is. And unless they drastically increase loot value or numbers then those two becoming a passive perk that still requires a level up to use but doesn't take up space in your perk build makes sense.
---
I will say my only major gripe about this game right now is that there are players who can one shot legendary enemies before anyone else has any chance to get a shot in.
---
&gt;I wish you could price items on a scale, say, volume discounts.
---
Or allow us to bulk ammo, as has been requested dozens of times since player vending became a thing.
---
Ahahahahah! xD
---
It sure is friend!
---
Some spots have been hit and miss for me lately. I just casually do Whitesprings and West Tek every now and then if I'm in the area. Sometimes I get one legendary, sometimes three, sometimes none. I've seen people say it's all RNG sooo good luck! Horde events like suggested is good too. There was a post earlier about the chance to spawn high level enemies if you let the Horde Boss stay alive long enough to spawn more waves of enemies. Worth checking into. I've also noticed an obscene amount of legendary enemies at Project Paradise. Idk if it's a bug but every time I've done it I leave with at least 5 legendaries. Garbage usually but easy scrip.
---
Below the argos pharmacy spawns alot of 1 star assaultrons as well from my time running around down there.
---
Quantity of Liberators.
---
Getting Mama Dolce little bit more interesting.
---
60 as mentioned. The event really does require a group to attempt properly. I've seen a 3/3 a couple of times.
---
Thanks good to know, have only used it a couple of times but perfer to not because of the non communication .   Makes more sense in that case.
---
I'll wipe out anyone's stock of 40mm grenades or .308 if they're selling at 1 cap each. Would be happy to buy all yours if your on XB1!
---
I have over 1500 hours into the game and over half those hours going through the trial and error on my heavy weapon specialist.  In my opinion, this is an enjoyable part of the game and I don't want to take that away from you.  There are quite a few changes I would recommend to your build, but the only  one I would suggest to save yourself some frustration is you'll want to get 3 ranks in Bear Arms as soon as you can.  If you want to use heavy weapons exclusively, then you will probably want to carry 3 heavy weapons to cover any situation you run into.  Best of luck to you.  My heavy weapons specialist is my most powerful PVE character and I play it the least now because few encounters are challenging anymore.
---
WAIT!
---
They can see what I'm wearing UNDER my clothes?????
---
Bethesda, we need lead shielded underoos.
---
That‚Äôs a good point.
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain it will happen, not because of balance per se, but because:
---
shifting meta = grind = maintaining player engagement = money flowing
---
Violet or cobalt?
---
I will buy any 100/100 Fusion Core I see when the price is 50 caps
---
Damn, good to know haha. Sorry I‚Äôm on PS4 but I also just ended up using them to shoot a grenade launcher for fun lol.
---
No pic but I got a TSE LMG
---
You cannot drop nor share mor vend the pro snap deluxe
---
Thanks...and I might use bear arms because of that too IF I hold 2 or more weapons like you said.
---
It seems to me like the respawn rate for food iss just too slow even with multiple people you can only get so much. I did end up in a group with a deathclaw one time but the other two were bugs and got one shotted.
---
Probably go up to 50 if I was in need, 100 if I was desperate, but I'd probably only buy it for 20 to 30 per bulk on a normal day.
---
\~7.9 scrip/legendary item turned in if you assume most of the scrip has been spent. That's a lot of 1\* junk removed from the game.
---
if you nuke watoga surrounding  area you get  way over 200+ with green thumb
---
Touch√©!
---
Was prior to view stats fix, and even then it‚Äôs difficult!
---
But I still see them for very low prices (not TSE, bloodied or explosive).
---
Right now I just put mines inside the chewer......
---
Never forget the server/hour problem, sometimes you‚Äôre just in the wrong place.
---
Judging by the salt mine on here since the patch dropped, seems a lot of people had problems lol
---
Was up in grafton at like lvl 15 back in november.. swear had one dude in area didnt know if he was getting a bj or was suffocating.. maybe both. Near the train station walked to other vendor tryin to get away from him and there was someone down by the school singing horribly off key early britney spears.. ruined fallout just a bit, switched chats to team and havent been back since. Unless i see someone tryin to get my attention.
---

---
After doing all of the available quests and unlocking most of the items from repeatable quests, I mostly log on to do the challenges. But lately I just feel like it‚Äôs such a pain I don‚Äôt even bother with them. I log on, look at them, log off, and open rocket league.
---
I get that‚Äôs it‚Äôs meant to be challenging. The daily challenges are simply ridiculous. The weekly challenges are most of the time more doable than the dailies. 
---
I hope they make the dailies a little easier, it‚Äôs my incentive to play the game on a daily basis. Once I get going it‚Äôs easy to have an enjoyable experience. But when I notice I‚Äôm going to have to ask one of my friends to stop what they are doing, get diseased, go to the pumpkin house, and let me snap a pic for 10 cents worth of virtual currency. I just loose interest in playing.
---
When they patch the fast travel bug into Arktos pharma  that‚Äôll be fun, as it is I only see 1 or 2 other people...
---
Didn't get to loot the alpha in the Paradise event cuz it spawned in a separate habitat and by the time I ran over it was killed already üòí
---
He's not wrong. I get kicked out to the main screen or disconnected once or twice a night and I only play for 1.5-2 hours at a time. The game is still very unstable and by this point, there is no indication Bethesda will make any attempt to resolve.
---
Well dang
---
My friend does die more often than me, but other than that it‚Äôs just smooth sailing while leveling everything in his path.
---
Thought it was violet, could be off though since its been awhile.
---
What type of rifle?
---
60, we got 2 with 3/3 and 1 2/3 with 6 people working together. Teamwork makes the dream work!
---
Interesting and good to know.
---
Uh, what? Since when did poison damage have anything to do with armor reduction?
---
His console isn't broken, *dude*. It happens to both myself and my friends on a nightly basis. It's still an unstable pile of dogshit.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this but have yet to have another legendary spawn
---
That would ruin me.. I'd have so many parts..
---
Dont die
---
[Happy hunting!](https://media3.giphy.com/media/xUOxfg0ESyhKOv4Vva/source.gif)
---
Negative, we need a way to opt put pf these notifications before this happens. This event triggers every half hour. That is way too often to have a popup nag the whole server.
---
No that's the shocking part, but you don't get a reward obv just the healing from the skill
---
And all of them not following prompts... same here I used to be daily for a good session now I just log in and go move on to something else
---
I agree. Although I swear there are times where I'll tag the SBQ early on and then once she dies I don't get any XP or loot from the body.
---
I farm Whitesprings. I have found that I will do a run and get lot of legendaries then if I don't switch servers before my second I don't get any.....
---
Oof lucky me
---
Agreed üëç
---
You gotta delete everything touching the stairs and then you should be able to delete them so any walls attached to them anything like that delete it and you should be able to delete the stairs at least thats how i use to do it and it worked
---
It's literally in the tips bar during loading screens. This mechanic is supposed to exist, Watoga wasn't.
---
I‚Äôve been running cannibal since lvl 25 and I knew this I just thought you got a wanted level, I know what I‚Äôm doing today lol
---
Heavy BOS combat armor has best damage resistance than any other armor (except PA). Marine armor is the 2nd best
---
Could have purchased the plan from a vendor or got it from an event or a drop. Also this thing is very outdated now
---
People are bagging on you but you are completely correct. The game still disconnects on myself and friends once or twice a night. We'll get excited **if it doesn't boot us once a night**. Do you understand how shitty that is?
---
And why would Bethesda focus on stablization rather than atom shop and possible future micro transactions? The user already bought the game - there is no financial incentive in this game to make it more stable than it is currently, which is slightly above beta or launch - sad.
---
3 Legendary spawn with Uranium Fever as well, and it's in the Whitesprings neighborhood
---
Not until we have an option to opt out of these notifications. It triggers every half hour, that is way too intrusive.
---
Also I use the Fasnaht Man Mask too!
---
We been using the Pioneer Scouts as our team faction with a similar purpose.
---
I would love an instigating bolt action or lever action.
---
My favorite weapon right now is an instigating bat while sneaking.  6x damage without the various strength related perks.  An instigating rifle with sneak attack buffed is 5x without the perception perks.  
---
Instigating combat / assault rifles or smg's suck though.
---
Strange. When I‚Äôd die I‚Äôd still be in the event and spawn inside. Sucks tho
---
No shit. Well my team is mostly noobish folks who like trying to kill the top of the leaderboards. We can get a kill or two in before being destroyed by guys in sentinels with sparkle guns. It's fun.
---
Some guy O tried to recruit a friend of mine into a discord group. One day P joined the group. I'm assuming this is the group your talking about.
---
Too bad they became cheaters. Oh well more people to kill!
---
Go to the trade subReddits.  Bring caps.
---
I use the man mask for the same reason plus it looks great with a camera 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/6PQhHkw](https://imgur.com/a/6PQhHkw)
---
No part of your statement refutes any part of mine.  You just told me I‚Äôm wrong and he‚Äôs right, and ignored the explanation for why you both might be having issues.
---
And saying he‚Äôs right and that they have done nothing since launch is a logical fallacy which can be proven wrong simply by pointing to a single example where the experience has improved, for which there are tens of thousands of examples in this sub.
---
&gt;I actually pvp'd a guy for the first time who had an explosive laser rifle
---
Hey.. Ding dong, you also PVP me.. I ask why... I didn't trade for my weapon, I earned it from the system. I didn't do anything to engage you but you attacked me and stole my stuff.. why?
---
Additionally I don't have sentinel armor. So that would make you a liar about "the first time".   At least be honest about your activities of unsolicited attacks on players that have not engaged you. I'm just pointing out that your pouting "First time" and I remember your actions against me as well. I had fun with the engagement so I'm not crying. I also reminded that I killed you before I jumped out to another world as PVP is not my bag. I know that I did this surrendering while my bag.
---
I dont even know how I did. I jumped off of a 1 story catwalk. Normally not far enough to take damage, especially with bird bones. Had 75% of my health too so...idk
---
All that being said, I still like it enough to carry it around, and use it a lot.
---
Are you on PC?
---
 [/u/jessbethesda](https://www.reddit.com/u/jessbethesda) still awaiting on a response.
---
True...that's my usual cap strategy is mass producing those and getting 1400 caps a day out of it (as long as no one shuts down my rubber farming at Grafton).  But once the vendors are dry, having things available in your shop is a way to get more caps than the 1400 limit.
---
Well I was thinking. Since wild Appalachia had so much to do with animals and the scouts it doesn‚Äôt seem like Wastelanders would have to do with people or things in vaults. Maybe focuses on the factions more? More control for wastelanders?? Maybe this is where we start using the voting machines and really establish the wasteland as wastelanders. 
---
I doubt they‚Äôre going to open vaults so close together. I Imagine they will keep it pretty spaced out. Slow release of vault content.
---
It's been a thing since vendors dropped sadly.
---
Thats why I'm surprised 3 ammo types are on the most sold list. How many caps just vanished?
---
I pulled all mine till its sorted.
---
I've noticed a lot of legendary 1-3 stars between events, I think I like it better then the old WS grind
---
Of the top of my head:
---
Bloodied +explosive/fire rate on most weapons
---
Instigating + explosive/vats crit on hunting rifle
---
Instigating/bloodied + swing speed + 1str on any slow hitting weapon
---
Furious/vampires/bloodied +swing speed + 1str on any fast weapon
---
Unyielding + AP refresh + sentinel/weapon weight heavy combat armor / marine armor
---
Do put 1* in your vending machines for less than 100c so I can come buy them and put them in the scrip machine myself.
---
Yeah I've had 3 separate deaths all from glitches (and rando explosions?) and only once did it load me back into the event. Other than that it kicks you out and lands you in Appalachia saying event failed (regardless of remaining time)
---
If it were possible to maintain stealth, would that make instances like West Tek a quicker grind?
---
Depends how much you value rad resistance. If you do, marine armor is better. If you don't, combat armor is the way to go. Marine armor can also be much lighter than combat so it's very good for sneak builds.
---
Marine is my preferred option.
---
Unfortunately horde events are very very very broken
---
See ya later next patch
---
If you're on a team, you get to loot. So team up and unless all of your teammates are support, you get to loot the boss.
---
I think my most recent pop up told me I sold 2700 10mm and I literally only got 27 caps
---
I mean yeah, high damage instigating items = awesomeness.  6 dmg instigating items = worthless.
---
I always can complete it using a Tesla rifle
---
It would be amazing something like " while you are actively participating in de event your rewards increase for each objective accomplished, moobs loot won't be available until the end of the event, when that happens a crate will spawn and the total amount of your reward will be inside of the crate, then you can choose what to take and do not" As an old World of Warcraft dungeon final boss with crate.
---
u/ladydevann sorry for the ping but this is a major issue for a lot of us.
---
Is this why sometimes I'll see nothing but non-stop Suppressor / Junkie bullshit?
---
This. Non taggers should get rewards from a different loot table.
---
West Tek is a great location. Last time through I gained a level, 2 *** and 3 *.
---
Big ol side of beans
---
This is level capped I believe...also if you just looking for scrip player vendors often while have some cheap 1 and 2 * items....I even got a 3*rolling pin for 32 caps; all perfect for the scrip machine.
---
No this is a new bug that started for me with the patch before last. Even if NOTHING is attached, sometimes you can‚Äôt remove stuff, and basically have to start fresh with a whole new camp.
---
The more you feed the 3 machines the better your allied creatures will be.
---
I see you're also a person of class
---
May I suggest Rigell's [ACME](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253) and [Clean Plaster Walls](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/253) for inspiration? :)
---
Maybe a nuclear bomb is going to drop. Removing all the green in the game
---
It would help if these events also had a staging timer. Either that or make the load times quicker. But that ask is a stretch.
---
Of course there are. On a side note, the Radium and Combat rifles have way cheaper AP costs than the Handmade does, making them better Vats weapons.
---
I believe it is something like 26 verses 34 for the semi auto versions.
---
So you‚Äôre the guy! &gt;:( 
---
Jk. It really is a good spot. 
---
Agreed! I‚Äôll keep that in mind then
---
Thanks guys
---
Hmm, I haven‚Äôt done the event yet, but if you‚Äôre playing with friends maybe have one of them switch places with you while you run to the other habitat and tag the alpha? I say friends because if you‚Äôre asking a bunch of strangers to swap in the middle of a fight to go protect the animals, 99 times out of 100 everyone‚Äôs just gonna ignore you lol. Needs to be pre-planned.
---
I have exactly the same someone bought 1000 ultracite shells and only got 250 caps while they were priced at 2c each
---
You are talking content by this point. The user was talking server stabilization. That is not a *logical fallacy* to state that the servers are at where they were in terms of stabilization beta or launch. If your experience is different, great, enjoy it while it lasts. But they'll keep coming out with patches to correct issues that shouldn't have made it through QA to begin with, and they'll keep releasing new events that cause unplayable circumstances (vending machines, arktos pharma, the sheepsquatch, etc). They'll keep focusing on awful quests like the badges to get the backpacks, while players are still getting booted out to main screen numerous times in one night, or still have to take hours building a camp that should take a tenth of the time, only because you can't properly link camp items together.
---
They've done an incredibly poor job in rollout and progression with the game. New content - great. Focusing on the foundation of the game, the servers, the camp, not so much. Worse than not so much - failing completely.
---
I also run the clown costume and I‚Äôm obese
---
I tried this in the mire yesterday, but after 10 minutes the ghouls weren‚Äôt spawning at higher levels. Not sure if it was because I was near a camp.
---
That‚Äôs a powerful leg you‚Äôve got...
---
Oh. You're a real big man! Telling strangers on the internet what it means to be a man when you dont know the 1st thing about them. You dont know me from mite on a chickens fucking ass so why dont you move the fuck on big boy.
---
We failed and I got killed by the squatch and didn't get the loot because the body disappeared when I got back into the building :c
---
I go out of my way to make sure other players tag legendary enemies. Anyone that doesn't is an asshole. But everyone's so afraid of not getting loot they go ape shit over legendary enemies. I don't see legendarys get one-shot, I see High-level players continue to shoot it after they appear and it's dead within 3 seconds and I know for certain some of the lower level players didn't get to tag it. They are scum of the earth and I completely agree with the OP. 
---
There's been 4-5 posts about this that have made it to the top in the past 48 hours. Not a single Bethesda reply. Not one.
---
I promise I will only use this power for healing... Heh heh
---
TSE Lever and FE LMG. The rest were shit.
---
Would love to up vote you much more.
---
I‚Äôd roll a lot of shit to get just one of those!!
---
I wont survive for even one second lo ger while wearing a full set of Sentinal assassin then I would wearing absolutely nothing. That isnt balanced either jackass.
---
So, lemme ask you this: a "rejoin last server" (RLS) feature could easily be used to exploit enemy spawns in nuke zones. Right now, if you use a friend as an "anchor" to a server you just nuked, you can go into the nuke zone, clear the enemies, collect loot, log off, reconnect, respawn the enemies because the server thinks you're a new player so it spawns a new set for you, rinse, repeat. With RLS, this process would be even easier.
---
This is an inherent flaw in how 76 handles enemy spawning. I really like the idea of RLS because it would make a lot of 76's core features more enjoyable (CAMP building, workshop claiming, nuking, etc.), and I think it would be a net positive to the gaming experience. That said, can you *please* forward feedback to the dev team that the game's enemy spawning system could use some love because right now it's *functional*, but not what I'd call *elegant*.
---
That's my vendor to a T, I scrip what I can across my two chatacters then vend the rest, all super well priced, don't want the stash filled up for long.
---
The setting: apocalyptic fiction is something i'm really into, and just being able to explore a world with a unique timeline that ended tragically is really engaging. The Fallout universe is really well crafted, and has a "feel" to it that other series don't have. And there's a fun shooter game in there, too.   
---
I also love the character customization. It's great to be able to play as a character who is whoever i want them to be.
---
Possibly the simple overwrite might be easiest. They already have that type of system in place with tech docs since it will only register one of them in your inventory once you do the Forbidden Knowledge quest.
---
Super frustrating when you and a bunch of other people do all the work only for someone to come along and delete the boss with some bloodied melee build or something.
---
Right? Kick attack for 150 dmg
---
I guess I'll just have to take all the ammo out of my shop for now...
---
Maybe it's a problem with selling a large stack of items, cos whenever I sell single items they sell for the correct amount. Maybe it's a bug with the 10% tax applying to large stacks...
---
A guy let me die just to get my loot so, there are no laws in the waste
---
But that was just day 1, like a teaser, now it‚Äôs ALL crap. Lol
---
Scout Armor can be happy medium, albeit tougher to come by and even tougher to mod.
---
I'm more concerned with the fact I crash more than anything.
---
I think it's more a problem wit tax applying to things under 10caps
---
It was more about reload speed? And there are a few spots, like in the research lab, that are impossible to maintain stealth, but yeah, overall it could be ran faster than I did.
---
With rifles, it's a string of uninterrupted concentrated fire/gun fu/1shot headshots. With the xbow, it's 1shot, wait for reload, 1shot, wait for reload, (broke cover) crap, shoot, reload, kill, reload, shoot, reload, kill, reload. :)
---
Pro tip don‚Äôt do the main quest , just level to 50 then do the main quest
---
Then you will find nice discounted weapons. I will still sell something like an AA limb damage combat shotgun but the up price for the limb damage may be as little as 200 caps over an AA combat rifle
---
10mm smg and 45 smg also use auto rifle perks
---
I feel they've gone half measures with this one. Take a picture of a player in a clean spacesuit fighting an alien during a radstorm at night while intoxicated would be more like it.
---
I didn't downvote you xs I'm glad you're willing to give advice...
---
Hope this gets sorted. Got a 3* unyielding piece in in the process of modding. Stash is filling up with erroneous scout armor mods cause the system is so jacked.
---
youtube link?
---
Were you, by chance, impregnated by a sheepsquatch? Hormones can do funny things...
---
Combat for DR; Marine for RR. A mix of Combat and Marine is probably your best bet for comprehensive protection. However Legendary Scout w/+25RR would be my go-to preferred armor if the mods were a bit more readily obtainable.
---
To an extent. Turrets are easily exploitable and not all that reliable when it comes to monsters . This also doesn't take in to account enemies that attack from far range outside of a turrets scope.
---
It's a common complaint that bases are being constantly attacked from outside of turret range and people are coming back to broken walls and raided crops. There's times where turrets don't do anything thanks to Bethesda's spotty coding. Makes it easy for people like me who enjoy busting bases :) I can say for a fact that I've had little issue leveling bases with turrets. The only expense is caps spent on fast travel, which is easily recoup-able.  
---
It's even better if somebody comes back to their base while it is being toppled. With Pacifist on, I don't have to worry about them damaging me :3
---
Ah that would make sense, especially if your selling for 1 cap since technically you should be getting less than a cap for that
---
I guess dude. I have Adrenal reaction, two stars in adrenaline, two in Demom and a BE Lever Action putting out 480 per shot. I've yet to one shot a mole-miner supervisor.
---
You'll get max level rewards
---
"But if we don't tell Bethesda how to make their game, how will they know how to make it?!"
---
Just run straight to the queen naked and hack her legs with the machete
---
I dont think this is possible due to the way the game is programmed for instanceing loot to characters.
---
Look how you can access your stash from anywhere even from others camps.
---
The game cant see if youre actively particapating without the use of tagging.
---
You fire 1 bullet to the SBQ that player will get loot.
---
Next week!
---
Actually, it's a Fallout main page exclusive!
---
(Also, two backstage videos are planned to be released)
---
I'm using two explosive cause i Got really Lucky with the purveyor rolls... The bloodied effect i really don't like ( i get why People like it tho)
---
Agreed, and should not allow players 50- join the elevator or fast travel to event
---
Yh that's when I think they fucked up so no more selling ammo then
---
I‚Äôm just now getting back into the game. Lvl 66 working on all my perks. 
---
I digress. I gotta agree events take quite a lot of time and are kinda rare to find especially like the new one. I participated spent tons of my ammo which at this point I‚Äôm realizing was super Detrimental, and didn‚Äôt get anything from it. Feels bad man.
---
This is true. Sometimes they actually get one shot but you are correct that the player would continue shooting to kill after they tag it. I carry my tesla rifle just for events like this but unfortunately not everyone in 76 is courteous about letting all players tag the legendaries. Hoping one day they make events shared loot but we‚Äôll see.
---
Definitely a needed addition now that everyone has god roll weapons.
---
Yeah we now know that
---
Where's that generic reply tho?
---
Pipe revolvers are ingame as of last week dude just hit up murmgh
---
I was thinking of doing a similar post with a Power Armor/Heavy Weapons build but seeming as you did I'll throw mine into the mix and see what you think :)

Whilst I am not 100% sure this is a 'done deal' I am pleased with it so far. The only factor that is playing on my mind is food wastage. Over the past few days I've been trying to survive on preserved food/can dog food etc and nothing that is grown at CAMP and it seems a viable option with purified water for thirst. In regards to radiation from food/water etc the abundance of rad-away and the diluted version makes radiation a joke in game as far as I'm concerned. One 'giant' thing that could be a factor is the 'early' to mid game - P/A becomes available at lvl 15+ and also the availability of power cores in the early/mid game lvl 15 - 30 but I'll just have to wait and see :)
---
God fucking dammit. That‚Äôs is strangely amusing
---
why do you bring loot to events?  that's your fault
---
Such a shame because the Xbow is just so damn cool. I was hoping compound bows would show up and somewhat alleviate the issue. That makes a lot more sense having had it explained like that, so thank you!
---
I'm sure it's just coincidence, a bug like you say, but it sure does _feel_ like they don't want ammon changing hands at all
---
Took me a month to find a new location.  
---
In that month, though, I could count on one hand the number of times I actually went back to Camp - I was finding enough stuff in the world that I didn't really need to.
---
But my old locale was not convenient for player vending (on a narrow ledge near grafton steel), nor was in convenient to where I was roaming (ash heap and the divide).  But it wasn't attacked by anything, either.
---
Moved a couple weeks ago.  Near TotW on the map, forest side, elevated, with a resource node.  Since its central, lower fast travel cost.
---
To that end, I'd look for something relatively convenient to where you are roaming at the moment, with a resource node and near regular traffic path if you plan on vending.
---
To be fair... at that point... there's a few missions you probably shouldn't do if that's your goal.
---
I tried the event once yesterday.  3 star sheepsquatch appeared, and the game crashed.  Yeah...i'm not doing this event until they fix this.
---
Bethesda Devs said they're letting their team know :)
---
Same for me.  My first roll was pretty epic, garbage since.
---
I get you, but there no real way to give a specific enemies kill loot to people who didn't tag it, but did other things in the event. That's what the event rewards are for. So you could reduce the bosses kill loot, and shift more of it to the event rewards, but people already complain that bosses don't drop enough and honestly, that would probably just encourage more people to just show up and stand around.
---
I'm not sure how the game could really track things like who is contributing significantly to keeping the cows alive, or who is contributing by tanking damage or healing downed players. What's the cut off? Show up and kill one scorched, and you can loot the queen? Maybe contribute a certain percentage of the total damage dealt in the even area, regardless of target? Still wouldn't help defensive/support characters.
---
How would you do it, in a way that is fair, gives everyone who contributed rewards, without rewarding people who just show up, and without killing stability by tracking and calculating a million extra points of data. It's easy to ask for features. Harder to figure out how to implement them.
---
In the mean time, when you show up to one of these events, if you aren't already on a full team, try inviting other players who show up. While you don't get experience for kills you don't personally tag, in my experience, you do (usually) get a loot pull from kills you don't tag, as long as you are nearby when one of your teammates tags it. So being in a full team increased your chances of getting loot from random legendaries/bosses, even if you are busy found other stuff.
---
Yh well I hope they fix it soon
---
I got a 3 star pipe revolver from the scrip vendor.
---
Bethesda: Here are some challenges (Buy More$$ Atom$$$$!!)
---
Just shoot the enemy once. Doesnt take time
---
Ugly chic xD
---
All of these drove me crazy. If you wouldn‚Äôt say it to their face like that, don‚Äôt shout it anonymously. Ugh.
---
It crashes even more for me now.
---
Would a silenced shotgun build work in place of the xbow, I wonder? I can't imagine it is as quiet as the xbow.
---
I'm more concerned about the fact I crash more than anything but I'm not mad about anything.
---
2500 scrip netted me EE Gatling and EFFR Laser Gatling (3*s each).   Rest was trash.  But not a bad overall success rate.
---
100% agreed. I play the objective and miss out on the best loot.  I've just stopped jumping in on events as it was getting frustrating.
---
I still sell to vendors because i need to get rid of the weight in my stash instead of waiting for who knows how long for a random customer to decide they want TO BUY USEFUL ITEMS FOR CRAZY BARGAIN PRICES. UNLIKE COMPETITORS. OUR PRICES ARE INSAAAAAAAAANE. GET MORE, PAY LESS. Not my problem that they can't see i have the best quality items for the lowest prices in the mid-Appalachia area. I need room in my stash.
---
Here‚Äôs the picture I‚Äôve promised!
---
[Better late than never!](https://imgur.com/gallery/ssB2tJD)
---
Yeah they need to look into adding some more stability to the servers and game.
---
I sell 1k of different types of ammo @1-2 cap each and I get the correct amount minus the 10% tax. I‚Äôm not having the same issue as y‚Äôall. Is it in every sale or just certain ammo types? I‚Äôm dealing in 308, 44, 2mm and shotgun.
---
Yeah level 50 all rise over level 35.
---
I waited to do them on my second character, no regrets. Seems a bizarre ass thing to down vote but whatever.
---
Yeah, I'm holding out hope that it'll eventually get mods for specialty bolts or AP.
---
Hmmm... IDK if my AA LMG is hardened/piercing.  I know my 50s are not refined.  Looks like I may have some modding to do :)
---
I'm in the same boat. Held on to all the extra polymer/deep pocket mods I buy (to find out there wrong), would love to be able to sell them. Just don't know anyone who would buy them without knowing what they are.
---
Yes pls. PS: BekR321
---
Oh dang I gotta do that!
---
Feel it out.  There's not rush.  Explore by yourself and do events with groups.  Take the time to explore and look at nooks and crannies.  There's a lot of great stories in the game - but rushing around with a team makes it go by too fast.
---
Can confirm, saw the picture, i am indeed pissed off now lol jk nice roll!
---
nah forget that - use a rolling pin, unmodified :)
---
Loved your video, nicely done!!!
---
Yes sir that‚Äôs what I found out. When you see a few items in a row are of the same prefix and it‚Äôs not what you look for, server hopping might be a good idea, unless the drop frequency for the garbage is extraordinary, then maybe you can keep collecting just for scrip purposes.
---
Thank you for the serious reply!
---
You mean the story of how people are either responders, enclave, BoS, or raiders?  And most of the stories center around responders in fo76 and how the raiders are all dead?  Or you mean fallout 4, where raiders were typically the easy level combatants, and the real meat of the story was BoS, synths, railroad, and minutemen?  fallout NV where it was legion, Mr. House, new California republic,  boomers, enclave remnants, followers of the apocalypse, great Khans, or BoS? Or fallout 3 where it was BoS, BoS outcasts, talon, enclave, children of atom, and slavers? 
---
Yeah... I can totally see why a fallout fan would want to be a raider.  Such a compelling bit of lore...  Really the only option, when you think about it.
---
Everyone--even other Xbox players--always say this, but it has never worked for me.  If I go to some random player on the list, I always get a message that the player has to be my friend to join the server they are on.
---
Hahahah while diseased and suffering idk the whoopsies
---
Rispondo in italiano che faccio prima: la stessa cosa mi √® successa con un paio di Assaultron nel nuovo evento e con la maggior parte dei ghoul a WS. Il top √® stato lo Sheepsquatch del nuovo evento diventato ‚ÄúVernice Winter 3‚Äù
---
Optimized over 600+ hours of play. Melts SBQ in 2-3 minutes. IMO, the most useful utility perks combined with the best dps output in the game.
---

You'll spend that at the chiropractor after carrying them though.
---
So they say.  Never works for me, though.  The system always tells me the person has to be my friend to join them.
---
He clearly doesn't play the game
---
Best...vamp/ explosive/ something railway or furious/+10aim/something plasma Gatling.
---
Running the event should drop a participation trophy too so nobody feels bad.
---
Welcome to online games. Sometimes you get a shit team. Sometimes you have a great team and get fucked by RNG anyway. If nobody on your team wants to run the secondary objective, read the room and consider it a loss. Go tag the boss and get yours. There's no point to develop down because you get stuck with shit random players on occasion. The game has had enough features crippled by developing down and issues that'll never be fixed already.
---
++ to the bear arms. It‚Äôs a must have for heavy. Plus it fun to see a mini gun weight 4lbs.
---
I had a hunting rifle and a pipe rifle. There was one more, a combat rifle IIRC.
---
Fuck me! They even screw you over for in-game currency - fuckers!! ;)
---
Worst...the other 13 p.o.s. guns
---
Ohhhh
---
Fuckin right not once will i ever doors or ugly carpets
---
Is that slang for backwash?
---
I find it fun if its quirky, not ranged one hit because personally i think its too cheesy but say unarmed is pretty fun.
---
Bloodied grognak if you can find one. Mine would outpace damage on the all rise when low health.
---
Take your time with the quests- they don't last forever. Instead explore every corner as there is a secret around every corner of the map. So many cool Easter egg discoveries await you. Read everything. Listen to every holo tape very carefully. Emerse yourself. I wish I could could do it all for the first time again without the rush. Hold on I can! Boom - a level 1 baby is born.
---
Yes!!
---
Lmfao! I actually have a three star but it‚Äôs my favorite weapon.
---
I'm a melee character so I literally sell all the ammo I pick up, I don't remember which ammo specifically people have actually bought from me but I get the bug with every single ammo sale...
---
Hey thanks, I try to be objective in my suggestions.
---
This is entirely true. Luckily this event is a pretty short hike to the Whitesprings station vendor. I could not imagine trying it from WesTek or the like.
---
I would be happy with a purely cosmetic companion  that follows me around but if it was only available at camp that would be fine too. My dream companion would be something like a star wars mouse droid type thing that some intrepid vault dweller put a teddy bear skin on. It could make the beep boop sounds OR just the sound the teddy bears make when you pick em up. That little teddy bear squeak makes me happy :)
---
Thanks, I love to be immersed in these games
---
Lmao if I had known people would buy fusion cores I‚Äôd have sold mine long ago. some nights I‚Äôll just take a couple workshops like the bullet and fusion core and farm all extractors on both for a while and gather plastic when I have time. I had like 20 recently and had to drop some due to over encumbered.
---
And i only specced into it later on.
---
This is just crazy.. Admitting that the majority of the time it works.. but it only takes on failure to loose ALL of your junk..
---
You can buy one on trade subReddits.  Still a bit pricey due to novelty.
---
I still haven‚Äôt encountered an alien.  Ever.
---
The mechanic exists *as a threat to the player*, not as a loot dispenser.
---
The phrasing on the tooltip gives that away.
---
Though I agree it should stay this way.
---
I've been selling 100% cores for 30 caps each on PC for a while now, and no-one's bought one yet. Maybe that's a console thing.
---
Just like a legendary enemy shows 3* but it's a 1*drop
---
Seconded!
---
As a support type player in most game, I agree 100 percent
---
Besides what others have said, that they meant the 2 million kills were victims OF the Imposter Sheepsquatch, are you serious you've never seen the ISS killed?  Except for the first few times were people didn't bother to read the fucking manual, every time after that I've seen him taken down.
---
I've got Adrenal reaction, 5\* adrenaline, 9\* gladiator and 3\* incisor and if I use a bloodied bowie knife I might accidentally one hit. So I take off Adrenaline and the gladiator perks, then it takes 5 or 6 hits
---
I don't know. I'm not going to buy something I already have to test it. Besides, I already bought the armored mod plan with my outstanding balance of badges. Though I can say that every plan I bought gave me the plan to click-on. The machine doesn't normally teach it to you.
---
I'd settle for unbroken windows at this point
---
Also, keep in mind that "Diseased" creatures can spawn a legendary item. When I go through the golf club I kill everything before looting. Then when going back to loot, always find a legendary on at least 1 diseased dead creature.
---
? I buy 2-3 every day.  Those duped guns are often trade only or 15k.  If you have decent legendaries you want to dump, send me a message.  Really looking for a good assault rifle right now.
---
yeah but they should weightless and 20% weapon carry weight same as regular armor
---
I agree with most folks here.  I like 2\* ranged and have had pretty good luck. Once you have one or two good combinations (TSE, AAE, BE) you can either use them or go on the trading forums and get what you want in trade.
---
Dilly dilly!
---
Just go to the map and fast travel again, to the spot where you technically are. You should land on top as intended. Mountaintops are wibbly. I have to do that every 3 or 4 tries on my own camp.
---
That I don't know? I dropped shotguns around lvl 10 for rifles, and haven't looked back. With the limited exposure I've had with them, I think you could mix in melee, with probably much better results, at a much lower cost in perks and ammo. With unyielding, and the dmg boosts from low health perks/mutations, you could suppliment the xbow with melee without investing any STR perks.
---
Awesome! I'll apply later tonight.  Thanks so much for responding! :)
---
The problem is not of the armor, but the weapons.
---
Fallout 76 simply isn't balanced for PvP. Not a single PvP game worth mentioning works with overpowered legendary effects that eclipse all others, nor a gameplay that revolves around reamining hidden until you can VATS someone and drop him in half a second. 
---
To put it simply: PvP in Fallout 76 is crap.
---
15 yo me is laughing at me rn.. but you‚Äôre absolutely right about the lack of manners.
---
That's a fallout 4 thing.  Fallout 76 has door mats, but they are not fast travel mats.  I believe the concern is that people will use them to set up traps.
---
They were just introduced
---
Just wondering. Eventually I'll have badges left over after I've gotten everything.
---
Hoping the weekend will be better but I tried it twice this morning and only 2 of us were taking part and I was the only one feeding the food hopper, I‚Äôm guessing that because there were a few workshops under ownership those folks didn‚Äôt want to crash and lose their workshop or others tried to join but crashed out. I‚Äôve done this a total of 4 times, all have failed, all have had less than 6 people, all have had people not putting food in the hoppers, I hope they put a server wide notification on for it because at this rate il have more luck getting a formula p recipe from a player vending machine than getting one from the event
---
Please do I‚Äôm dying here xx
---
Weightless is useless on the chassis since it has no weight anyway when out
---
I have a big outdoor in my camp written "free water, free junk, free food" near my 4 water purifiers, junk extractor and carrot/corn/tato/mut/melon/razorgrain farm.
---
Howdy neighbor! I‚Äôm just up the field a bit near the lead vein.  Have you noticed the non-hostile scorchbeast that flies around often?
---
seriously... who can't pick the locks?  Once you have the level requirement, it's like 3 bobby pins max to crack them.
---
No clue why someone would do that, really boggles my mind.
---
But thanks for the info!
---
No luck yet, am scrolling through my post history to see if I can find who it was!
---
Are... are they holding a gun to your head? 
---
It's a fake money reward for a silly in-game task... and you want to complain about it, and suggest they pay you for the option to pay you for completing it?
---
I need a first mate if you're up for helping people.
---
I've gotten every single power armor plan, and I'd say the drop rate is about maybe 1:30. But it's RNG, so it could be 1:10... or 1:100. It varies, but I'd say the average is about maybe every 30 drops or so.
---
That's why it broken.. 
---
Bethesda, I really feel bad about banging on your code so often, but a "Fix" it is not if you break more items!!!! QA Man... QA... Prod can't be your QA
---
New content and new bugs
---
Yeah sad to see so many armor prices where it doesn't work. I usually end up scrapping them because of this.
---
Armor weight does play a factor in sneaking though (one reason wood armor was good for stealth snipers)
---
Aww man
---
flat #cough# woods #cough# Monster
---
Yasssss
---
If you're on xbox I have adrenal reaction, marsupial, speed xenon, and Twisted muscles for 250 each.
---
And price it right. All the booze recipes I've found in player vending is way overpriced. I'm not spending 500-1000 on something i will likely unlock myself in normal playing.
---
Yes I have he is so majestic. He gets pretty close but generally stays a bit more south of me. I‚Äôm always afraid the vertibirds are going to attack him so I try to keep them dead.
---
Good to know.  I had the same situation the OP had.  Hopefully it never happens to me again but if it does I will try it.
---
If it's costing you legendary... It's a different and more serious bug. Weapons are not in your "junk" that's because the server just didn't write the message for the weapon pick up.
---
Yep. Just look at Paladin Danse wearing the BOS hood instead of his helmet.
---
Bethesda's press conference at E3 will take place on Sunday June 9th. I doubt you'll hear much before then.
---
Assassin/sentinel
---
Yeah, I agree.  The daily challenges used to be a nice prompt for a starting adventure, but anymore, I don't even look at them because they are so ridiculous, except for the Level Up one.
---
So if the loot isn't worth the value, why the outcry to have it as a passive? You're basically saying that you want to unlock the door for the sake of unlocking the door.   
---
I think that it goes a lot further than the loot value behind the locked terminal or door. Many doors and terminals provide a massive shortcut or alternative ways to complete events or quests quicker, with stellar rewards. If someone doesn't have those perks equipped, and doesn't want to stop to change to them, then they take the long way. Added, if you and I are competing to complete something or if my character is running from yours, and you're spec'd for maximum DPS and I'm spec'd for utility, we each have our own advantages.   
---
You getting passive perks for lock picking and hacking for your max DPS build takes away and kills another's utility build. Its no different is someone builds a support build. They sacrifice damage to heal more, to revive better, etc.
---
Was that a recent change? Because before the Flatwoods monster wasn‚Äôt classified as an alien.
---
I'm online
---
I'm the same, every time I started a game on skyrim i'd mod the player inventory to over 1000 and keep increasing it as I played.
---
obviously there has to be some balance in an online game because some ppl don't exploit and others do, so you have to keep a level of balance. you may assume that some or even most folks will play the game normally. but the truth is ppl will break a game if they can.
---
basically because this isn't a single player game you can't have free reign to break it. if you break your single player playthrough of skyrim or fallout 4 or whatever, you can load the game. but here you can't. if the server crashes everyone gets booted off. so there has to be some level of stability.
---
This one annoys me the worst. I run that one solo but the second someone else shows up I switch out to my auto 10mm pistol for tags and goggles.   It bothers me to no end to spend the time to lure the night stalker and share in the ghoul kills for some jagoff to run out the building the second the diamond appears and blast the wendigo to death before I've left the barn. Like what's the point? You're just being a prick. Encourages the rest of us to start being pricks too. Thankfully more often I run into players like myself that take the time to tank the wendigo until they're certain everyone has tagged it.
---
Yeah no cough shit cough Sherlock. Random cough encounter. Cough rng  cough
---
Ya you wouldn't want to miss auto on those sick one star legendary from the boss fight
---
Magical weapons have no place in the Fallout world. None whatsoever.

There are issues with the lighting engine since 4 or 5 patches ago where the ground is luminus at night often with multiple different lighting methods visible at once, often to the degree you can see the seems in the ground textures! This particular seem is viable at my camp just outside of Spruce Knob!

Time to list my shotgun shells! Only thing selling consistently at my store are my White Russian recipes. Seems like the only thing I get from Biv nowadays
---
I server hopped for about 8 hours one day to get enough shadowed/deep pocketed/ and ultra light mods for a urban and forest scout set. So annoying buying 10 chest mods when you need limbs
---
Yup they will never add a good fix because they can‚Äôt, the only way to fix it would be to remove legendary effects from the game but that would remove a large chunk of why people even play 76 anymore
---
If i wanted to play a game with aggressive microtransactions and incredibly anti consumer tactics i would go play battlefield 5 or a mobile game. Bethesda used to know better.
---
You see this is why I hate players who abuse a good thing and ruins it for everyone else.

Looks like it can exploited or used the wrong way now. Everyone loses privileges to it. Goes after those who caused the issue.

I'm a cap whale, I buy any recipe I don't know at that price. Because resippies

The cap's at damage = 6.5x DR. Usually not a problem with a handmade because the base damage isn't huge. It's multiplicative, so AA + Tank Killer works out as a 68% DR reduction, while AA + Tank Killer + Perforating would be 81%.
---
Because of the way the DR calc works, the extra 10% of AA over Perforating is actually worth nearly 10% damage, regardless of whether you're running Tank Killer.
---
Oh I know. He was a rank 3. The highest rank. I filled it up to 60. So full. Still got wrecked.
---
I finished it no issues.
---
Named camera no other mods.
---
Make sure the creatures name shows up in the camera zoom screen.
---
Have to get pretty close.
---
Same here (xbox).  It's actually become rare for me to join Encryptid and have the event fail. I've also noticed a steep decline in the number of players getting killed during the event.
---
Yes I have been waiting for this feature as well, watch for update here:

There will never be a good balance in this game we are always meant to not be tanky and our weapons to be op that's the way it's always been in fallout it is just not a formula that leads to good pvp and any balance changes they make will negatively affect the core aspect of the game which is pve.
---
Good point. I'm looking forward to it.
---
Heh, I've seen this CAMP too.  I had to stop to figure out how they did the stripper pole.  Pretty clever.
---
Nah its not that, i have it on rn
---
Level 145 and I've seen two, killed one. They are very skittish- disappearing in a flash if you spook em.
---
Way to be optimistic! Lol
---
No, and it is getting worse with every release: [https://youtu.be/7NmVueCtba0](https://youtu.be/7NmVueCtba0)
---
I lucked out got the plan for The Fixer for 200. It is pretty great and i got to burn through my over overabundance of .45 ammo and got me to move my build from Rifleman to Commando.
---
Why would you be overwncumbured in the first place, carry so much junk around, sounds like poor managing
---
Excited for the new content, not so much for the bugs. At least the game runs better than at launch!
---
The only thing that sells for 2c is shells because farming plastic adds another layer of pain in top of crafting any other normal bullet. I sell 45 and 5.56 for 1c, shells for 2, plasma cos for 50, and everything else gets dropped.
---
People will buy missiles for 5c and mini nukes for 15-20,but I don't have the stash space for them so I just drop them in a bag at the nearest station.
---
I believe so as I was doing a challenge (about 2 months back) and it  was to kill the flatwoods monster and kill an alien and both completed when I killed a flatwoods monster :)
---
I sold 5 to some random who requested them for 5 ea. and was glad to loose the weight lol..
---
I want a winter theme for nuclear winter üò•
---
Ive had luck with selling BOS outfits but yeah ive drawn the same conclusions.
---
3* wood armor comes from the legendary vendor- I‚Äôve re-fed two of them to the vending machine
---
I stumbled on the imposter one and tried participating. I learned the mechanics through osmosis as I‚Äôm still a noob. Died multiple times and revived when I could. Broke almost all my gear lol. It was intense but I had fun even though I don‚Äôt feel I helped much other than killing eyebots and playing conduit. We ended up failing so I was going to try again til I read this post and I didn‚Äôt know I wouldn‚Äôt get anything. Guess I‚Äôll just avoid these big events for now.
---
I think ther're trying to tell us we're better off buying Atoms 
---
nice try Bethesda nice try you have no idea how much pointless shit we'll do to save 30 cents
---
Who the hell is buying all those Mutton Meat Pie recipes? Lol
---
Sames. I had considered selling them once I'm done but your right, there's still no way to tell (outside maybe setting up vendors for specific arms/legs &amp; chest).
---
Balls! Still have yet to get polymer, I threw the second tier one on due to impatience :p
---
The only way I see it happening is if they up the stash so that it's easier to manage while farming a matching set
---
Your character, not the player (j/k)
---
I like you :)
---
Let‚Äôs not forget that the majority of time you run into the alien he buggers of 90% of the time
---
It's more like an only option for shotguns
---
10 Cent - 10% fee is under the vendor prices. I'm just a little above the vendor selling price and I won't go under.
---
Interested as well. PC here.
---
There is no balance.
---
i.e. Energy weapons are supposed to be good against certain types of armour... but then you have the "This stuff is equally good against ballistic AND energy weapons!" armour... and suddenly, laser weapons are (balance-wise) useless.
---
Quite frankly... weapons should be weapons... and armour should be armour... and stats/perks should be the only thing making a higher level player "better" than a low level player. 
---
Armour and weapons should always have pros and cons... want high damage? then low fire rate. Want AP? Then low damage. Want high ballistic protection? Then you have little against energy weapons. And so on.
---
As for Power Armour? Don't even get me started. That shit should be *insanely* expensive to maintain and use. Expensive enough that one has to seriously weight the pros and cons before busting it out for a fight.
---
Ive had good luck with Shotgun Shells at 2. Ive sold over 4000 shells in the last week.
---
argh...
---
Stimpak diffuser is real now, should fix the quest (don't know myself, haven't tried yet)
---
As for the syringe vs Yao gui drops its health with your main weapon, only the final blow has to be with syringes. This includes bashing with it.
---
R u on PS4. I have leg and arm polymer mods in my stash. I need a chest. I have a deep pocketed as well.
---
I do not endorse your gloating
---
Are you willing to share your character's backstory and some rules? I love hearing about other people's roleplaying/headcanon type stuff.
---
ah, yea that makes sense.  
---
I use a shotgun, so my shells aren't being sold.   I put some missles and mini nukes in for free, but they just sat there for a couple days so i just dropped them off at a station.  thanks for the info :)
---
Nuka-meth hut
---
Still sucks when it spawns as Lv.10 in a max lvl spot in the Mire and you have to try your best to not accidentally hit it once or have it not die to Electrically Charged procs which happened to me last night. ;c
---
I was not aware that getting booted from the server every 2 hours versus not getting booted every 2 hours qualified as "content".
---
If you're going to live in an echo chamber where you ignore every bug fix post and every suggestion that maybe something other than the game is responsible for the some of the issues you're having, then please do us all a favor and stay inside that box.
---
Are they really? Been spending all my scrip on 3* ranged regardless.
---
I have a few of these, uses the ‚Äúcome here‚Äù emote, with the camera out.
---
Got a group of five out of the 20.....having all of them would have been great!
---
How is this an "aggressive microtransaction"... love to hear it.
---
"here. do this silly shit, and we'll give you free stuff from our atomic store, or don't... what do we care?"
---
Except I play this game without any problems.
---
We've wanted this for how many games now?
---
I know that Key Nuker is one of the most downloaded mods and it does just this.  Wish they would just pay the modder and put it into 76.
---
Grinding the materials to build something. Depending on your character built  tou can get overencumbered really fast.
---
Not broken, FYI you can beat it to death with the syringer and it counts. So whittle it down and then melee it with the sryinger (also helpful for crossbow kills at it also registers them as kills with a crossbow)
---
Probably so they can sell us one in the future...
---
Well, they were popular that week at least.  Afterward, you're right, I couldn't move them at any price.
---
Arktos stuff probably has a bit more longevity because it's quite difficult.
---
Can we also drop keys please? Or at least have the system destroy/consolidate extras like technical data.
---
I tried it almost 20 times today, without success. I tried changing servers, I came back at different times, but it never triggered
---
I did that challenge on ps4 last night and it worked for me. I did the finishing shot with the syringer but used my cryolator to bring the Yao Guai health to a sliver.
---
This! My husband and I were taking on a sheepquatch imposter and a bunch of people showed up. EVERYONE went racing for the imposter, which left a level 22 me to try and maintain all the pylons and keep everyone revived. And guess who didn't get any loot! F that!
---
De-fucking-stroyed. Nothing but a frame left and a large repair bill.
---
It's quite a sight too, someone was RIGHT on the edge of my whitesprings nuke, so I fast travelled, and it spawned me outside of the red, cool. Then touchdown happened. It was like those old nuke testing videos, literally the whole camp, purifiers and all just got actually blown away, it was cool to see, but then I realized what happened
---
PC here. I've only seen the Imposter killed twice total. Most of the time some lowbie starts the event and hardly anyone joins in with enough time to actually kill it. I guess I've been unlucky. :c
---
Well now you must be aware.
---
You're a melee builds that explains it never mind
---
This sounds to me like someone who thought they were a PvP god while using duped weapons and overpowered armor only to find that their actual skill was lacking once those things were taken away
---
For real dude? I mean, sure, with that logic it IS my fault. I am playing this game. So in a way, me wanting to get whatever plans I don't have yet IS my fault. 
---
If a player isn't worrying about caps, why even have a store at all? Just junk your garbage into a suitcase at a train station like everyone else does. No need to clog up your own stash limit with crap no one wants. 
---
And "screw the economy good enough and it will take forever to recover."? That is EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO NOT DO. Yet you're defending these people, because you don't even play the game.
---
I will remember this. Good stuff.
---
That is a suggestion to help new players with aid/ammo/weapons like a free thrift store. Keys cannot be dropped.
---
Im on ps4
---
Great, and it works for you, great. It doesn't work for every one, clearly.
---
I am starting to think that being in Morgantown prevents it. I got it randomly last night when I was halfway across the map.
---
I don't swap out, I currently run a tank/utility build. I can take FAR for damage than you can while providing bonuses to my friends medically and utilities, such as pick locking and hacking. You need all your current perk card slots to do more damage than I do, I use my current perk card slots to provide for my team outside of damage. It makes sense as it currently is.
---
Sure for a shorter range stealth.
---
Yeah there is this little girl sounds about 15 years old following me around in Flatwoods just begging for help I did not want to put my mic it but man she sounded so sweet and kind and asking so nicely to 
---
I eventually turn my headset on and I pretty much just guided her through the game and just having a good time she did not know how to do anything lol but she got better and better we played together for about 2 and half hours and she had to go to dinner this went on for like 3 and half days
---
her parents were wondering who she was taking to all the time  cause her father got on the mic and we chit chatted and I told him what we were doing and how old I was and told him I have little brothers and sisters to and that she was a only child and that they really appreciated what I was doing 
---
they said that she talks about me all the time and I‚Äôm her best friend I may be getting over my head cause every time I log onto Xbox she always invites me which is kinda annoying so I gota be offline some times my friends bust by balls saying I got a 15 year old GF but I know there jokeing.
---
Currently she seems to be a bit more independent as I see her playing alone but it‚Äôs not long before she invites me to a party
---
If he gets too close my turrets attack but it only happens when he‚Äôs attacking something else and they lead him my direction.
---
reading comprehension ftw
---
I was crashing. On Xbox. Restarted the box multiple times with no difference.  But then I looked in my personal terminal and saw the notice about it, and it worked.
---
Try it and let me know.
---
Running from one habitat to another and back without your friendly beast risking to die doesn't take time? Who are you? The Flash?
---
So good to know...
---
There's been times I'd see the same prefix 5-6 times in a row and just chalked it up to terrible RNG...
---
In hindsight I should have jumped servers.
---
threw mines out
---
They are intentionally making the atoms almost impossible to obtain in game for so many of these challeneges to force you to buy atoms. We all know that the atomic shop is just a way for them to sell us basic co tent that should really be in the game anyway, especially the camp items. It goes against what they promised us when they revealed this game, they already went back on keeping the store cosmetic only and recently they have been making atoms incredibly hard to get by playing the game, not to mention they still have not fixed a long list of bugged challenges that you are supposed to be able to complete from launch!
---
I run a AA handmade with the perforating mag for max damage. I'm so used to reloading often, more ammo in the mag is useless for me.
---
But you could only have the 30 round clip.
---
What would be the difference between the two if you used the drum mag without armor penetration on the AA?
---
I'm pretty sure that the AA still squeaks out and advantage......but if you're talking about trading tour first born daughter vs. 10k caps......I think the quad with penetrating rounds would be a better investment.
---
It says kill for me
---
Aw ye, that's a beaut right there. I've found I have better luck rolling 2-Star weapons. Got myself a mighty fine Explosive Assault Rifle the other day!
---
Its more like "here is aload of stuff we know you want in the shop, pay us for it or do these challenges within 24hours, btw, theyre either bugged or nearly impossible 70% of the time"
---
The gap is stupid. Hmmm, 10 caps is too low. Presses right bumper. 850 caps? 2200 caps? 
---
Increments of 100 would be nice to 1k, then 1k until a 2 second pause or something.
---
Better off w/ Ninja/Gladiator melee mix. Like... WAY better off.
---
How do you get the camera?
---
Then dont complain
---
The chances of getting a good roll are very slim. I'd say actually 1/100 gets you TSE or usable bloodied. I just trade/sell/buy on the private market or go to vendors. I've probably cleared whitesprings over a hundred times. For legendary weapons it's not worth my time. For armor it's a little different.
---
The pop-up is bugged your getting the right amount for what you actually sold. The pop-up is telling you how much they have. I know it's dumb and needs fixed but you are getting the right amount of caps
---
I believe they're on about the chemist challenge, not the hunter.
---
It also clearly works for **many** people
---
Hunting rifle is definitely something I would sell as it is the preferred gun for snipers and instigating is the preferred effect. 
---
Pipe rifle doesn't have a real market. Only pipes with value are bolt-action and pipe revolver because they can double dip pistol and rifle perks. Even then it's a niche build with not as many people playing it.
---
Combat rifle is something I would probably try to sell. Instigating is not as popular on it because most people run a more commando style build with combat rifle. Additionally combat rifle gets over shadowed by the handmade.
---
If all 1* I probably would have kept the hunting rifle and put it up for sale for 1k caps, turned the pipe to scrip, and tried to sell the combat rifle for 700 caps.
---
Except it requires co-operation from Average Player Joe
---
Could you still wear your enclave under armor?
---
How the hell do you have an endless source of them?
---
What they said... it's a new bug. Not sure what's causing it but its aggravating.
---
Well, I've been giving unneeded ammo away for free.  Can't seem to sell it even at 1 Cap.
---
Nah that ain't it, I sold 2700 10mm rounds and was at 800 caps afterwards...
---
Shotgun and Enforcer
---
You may be right. I'm just going off of memory here.
---
What I find surprising is that according to the wiki page a drum mag weighs the same as armor piercing, which kind of gives the AA an unfair weight advantage because without a doubt that huge drum should add more weight.
---
My tse combat shotty has been nerfed to... a nerf gun. Shame because i don't pvp and typically used it for silos. Ive had it for nearly 100 levels and now it just sits there. Rust won't even touch it. I wish they'd stop nerfing so much.
---
This! This is how this game makes me feel.
---
I think they need to make it completable with fewer people. Last night I went to a couple and it was like 3 people. That's not enough to do the 3 biomes, and we ended up just trying to protect 1 thing, and still failed because there were SO MANY mobs attacking.
---
I like your style. üòÄ
---
I established a fusion generator at a workshop (power plant). Fast travel to the workshop ended straight to shut off the entire game!
---
A few bugs I can live with, but this is just unstable matter and NEED to be FIXED!
---
I've noticed to if I exit out of build menu and go back in it works sometimes
---
I want this! I'd spend DAYS cleaning everything. But then, I guess they wouldn't be able to sell us clean versions in the atom shop. They already have clean generators and... I think it was water purifiers I saw.
---
850hr player here. Just saw and killed my first one at maybe 750hrs in.
---
"This is my Boom Stick"
---
Oh that's some genius placement! Now I'm torn between having a convenient location for my camp shop and an amazing location like this! Maybe I'll just flip a cap to decide.
---
There's two different challenges. One is KILL, one is to simply SHOOT. Killing works fine (get health low, finish with bleedout), but simply shooting doesn't appear to work. Not sure if it has to be a standard yao guai (not diseased, dusky, etc.), or if you need to have an unmodded syringer, but so far no luck on this.
---
90% reduced weight.  It does help give you the space to carry either a second weapon or a ton of ammo (especially cores) so it is very useful for heavy weapon builds.
---
90% reduced damage would be absolutely amazing.  There are damage reductions for when you are aiming or reloading, but the utility of those depends on the weapon.  Are you aiming a lot?  Reloading a lot?
---
Anything that speed the weapon up (fast fire or swing speed) also are very valuable because it increases your DPS, damage per second.  For insanely slow weapons though, it often isn't the boost it might appear to be.  For instance, faster fire on a 5 speed gun boosts the speed to... 6!  woohoo... similar guns are 40 speed, so enjoy that bonus of 1 point.
---
VATS is tricky, because is it a real VATS style weapon?  Also with VATS you probably want 3 star because there are useful VATS perks on the 3rd star that can really enhance your second star VATS.  I don't like VATS boosts on melee weapons because I don't use VATS a lot in that context... too clunky.
---
All of them should have their range defined by range parameter and reduction curve. Its just those with additional effects that yield ridiculous results. I'm on PC, and I am to very happy to dispute stuff with someone who brings value to it, even if we don't 100% agree on stuff.
---
But selling stuff to the vendor is too easy. One run at WesTek and you can max out your vendor. Everything else is extra caps. I sell mine all day at 10c. Hundreds at a time. Just because you can sell serums for 500c doesn't mean you should sell them for that because no one would buy them. The market is 200-300 for those. If I have a lot of something I'll lower to sell just to get it out of my stash. When I lower the serums to 200 they go instantly. One time I had 4 doz serums listed at 200c and they were gone. So on top of my 1400 daily vendor run, I got an additional 9600 caps that night. So in total just off the vendor alone I made close 1100caps on just those items alone.
---
Dropped loot dummy, I don‚Äôt have room for junk in my stash
---
I run stealth commando. I carry with me at all times: AA handmade rifle, The Fixer, and a furious 10mm pistol (all with powerful automatic receiver). Those are my only weapons. Constantly shifting between all three allows them all to last quite a while before needing to repair again or craft more ammo.
---
This is why you wash your mutations when you get empath instead of using a medic's weapon.  No one uses support cards.   A great support toon will get nothing while the people you support get everything.... just like real life
---
That list doesn't shock me nearly as much as the fact that we've collectively scrapped over 5 million legendary items.
---
You can wear whatever you want
---
Legendary Bone Hammers are in game. I also believe we can get legendary shovels but I haven't seen one posted yet. I'd love to see one
---
Literally same thing happened to me.
---
This change would be so good. It would give all players regardless of level an incentive to do what is best in the moment, and not just tag the 3\* while running away
---
Well if you're sure that's what they bought your having a different issue than literally everyone else. But if your just going of the pop-up then your having the issue I described
---
I don‚Äôt PVP.
---
I'm not sure, but I throw them in my machine for 20 caps and they sell instantly.
---
New content _old_ bugs :p
---
If the damage was reduced at range to keep it in-line with actual range value, but stagger was kept as is, wouldn't it still serve the same purpose?
---
But why? Why for this event vs project beanstalk? The rewards are shit? I‚Äôd rather have an AWOL announcement. Just curious as to your line of thinking :)
---
I've got all quads and I usually reload before I burn through 30 rounds.
---
But man is it nice to have 80 rounds when my sneak gets blown and shit gets hectic..... LOL
---
Nah
---
I moved my camp to Whitesprings. I like increased foot traffic and no enemy spawns when people fast travel to my camp but ive been spending a ton more caps Fast Traveling to things in the Mire or Cranberry Bog. I also kinda miss being out on my own with nothing else near me so i may move once i have sold all my generic BOS gear. Sadly my preferred place, the one ive had for months before moving, has high level spawns near it (one of the last ones was a Level 80 Legendary Sheepsquach) so i may have to find another place to put down. Sick of repairing half my crops and turrets when someone comes to shop.
---
[deleted]
---
Well I guess we're at a stand still now huh?
---
I would like to see that only level 50+ can start the event. I don't mind lower levels joining in, they can contribute to the feeders like the rest of us just fine, but since it's in a lower level area, there will be curious low levels poking around and accidentally starting the event (happened last night and got there just in time for it to fail).
---
Loading screen, just saw it yesterday.
---
Oh they do... There are many ppl that talk about buying them in a lot of patch threads and atom shop datamining photo threads.
---
You can view my post here and maybe that'll help. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brdr12/complete\_tadpole\_challenge\_checklist/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/brdr12/complete_tadpole_challenge_checklist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

Be annoyed, be very annoyed.  All you are doing is complaining about things you cannot, and will never, ever ever, never ever, be able to control. Want me to tell you what to do? Get a life, you'll thank yourself. Tagging or not lol
---
So your saying that I didn't actually sell that many rounds and did in fact get the correct amount of caps for the amount of ammo they bought? Cos I don't check how much ammo I had before and after so that could make sense...
---
My^pp^is^smol
---
You had to have scraped it because stored items to not remove it from the camp budget.
---
Well I‚Äôll be damned I knew cause I‚Äôve seen that loading screen a million times that an alpha can spawn more enemies but had no idea could spawn legendaries awesome psa bro
---
I've seen this post before and it's still funny.
---
Issue I have with that one is being leve 200 plus makes it more complicated and tedious
---
No, it doesn‚Äôt have any damage amplifiers, so I‚Äôd recycle it.
---
I've been wanting the pipe revolvers to get added as well. They're the only pipe weapons I really like.... Day one of the purveyor I find a junkies explosive pipe revolver in some guy's vending machine... for 1000 caps!
---
Keep looking, they're out there. Shovels, too. I'm buying the 3 star melee looking for that bloodied shovel.
---
I do pretty much always play on a 4-person team, sometimes with others on an additional team. But, yeah, that's not going to work. It's a large area with no direct path from habitat to habitat. Plus it's very chaotic with multiple hoards to defend against. The objective should not be can I tag the Alpha. So, switching places is neither ideal nor feasible.
---
In your defense I think this is the only FO76 video I ever watched and said to myself "Wow...that was actually informative".
---
Bloodied sledgehammer
---
I thought pipe revolvers were not a thing. Have they started to appear from the purveyor?
---
As he said in the video make sure the thing is above 2/3's...maybe thats why?
---
I learned the backpack but it disappeared?  I looked at all the crafting stations but to no avail.  I guess I'm just SOL.
---
Yep, every time. I usually kill him before I even realize what it is.
---
Missing the most important perks tbh... 3 int for armor pen 45%... 3 in luck for one gun army cripple chance. 
---
You have a lot or random shit... I‚Äôd ditch the random stuff in strength for bear arms and ordance express. 3 and 3... my agility is also 2 for adrenaline 2/5.
---
Bummer. Thought i found something awesome. Did they fix the Legendary seller giving you things near your lvl? I have only got lvl 50 stuff from her and im lvl 25.
---
AA + drum vs quad + perforating is just 40% vs 50% AP as you say. The counter-intuitive part is that this works out at +9% damage for the AA.
---
1-star weapons are normally pretty cheap. Typical price for an AA handmade would be around 2k caps. If you find the quad first then it's a good substitute though. I used one for a while on my first character.
---
yeah I used to carry all my junk on me during the beta because of pack rat. Then I got suckered into engaging in PVP and lost ALL of it. ALL. Dump my junk into my stash asap since then. But if you're on a junk collecting run and this happens? Infuriating.
---
Never take loot to an Event.
---
Sad part is once you find one you find dozens
---
You realize it makes mobs stop walkinand scorched beast land. It‚Äôs not a pvp perk WHAT SO EVER
---
It's literally a one second flash on the corner of your screen. Is it that annoying? This even needs as many people as possible.
---
Better off yeah but you could be a stealth shotgunner. Mr sandman silenced shotgun and all shotgun perks. What the hell!
---
Gotta not twist the ankle when ya land, bro. Khajiit will help you land on your feet.
---
Love this idea!
---
You need to start getting into the 100‚Äôs before you start to complain ;) 
---
Turn them in one at a time, whenever you find one, the enclave war room is great.  It‚Äôll happen eventually.
---
In the notes it says ‚Äúfuture updates‚Äù were other fixes said next update... so not sure if it did or not.
---
Tried it a few times, even if it's a low level horde the ones that spawn in are of your level. But occasionally I got two crowned enemy's not sure which is Which in when running around and end up killing the main one
---
I would put the code somewhere hidden (side of stairs or behind a bookcase) using small letters plans
---
Lots of leaks. YouTube or search on here. I personally think it's going to be a shit show.

I already killed one and completed that challenge, this one says to just shoot one.

These items get gone almost every session within a couple hours of them being in the machine.
---
Berserker build has nothing on Bloodied though.  It tops out at something like 50% damage, and that's only if you have 0 DR.  Even just 1 results in a significant reduction.
---
Yet, it's vastly more dangerous to play compared to Bloodied.  Personally, I think Berserker should be made comparable to Bloodied.
---
It was the loot I earned from the event. Paper bag stays down there but by the time you get back to it it's gone.
---
Legendary pipe revolvers are NOW A THING. Purveyor has provided us with the penultimate pipe rifle.
---
Normally a "Localized" (translated) project has a resource file that is exported out and sent to a service to translate for you professionally. You receive a file and import it back in and the project and your translations are done.
---
but If service has no real context of what is happening when that one excel cell is shown to the end user.. well that can make for interesting translations.
---
That's why there is no substitute for a native speaker of the target language on staff. I speak Spanish too but often laugh at some of the translations I see after the a file is received.. I mind you that I know my abilities are not good enough for production system in the public, but I still see errors!. This is why this topic brought a chuckle to me.
---
No shit right? Death by twisted ankle
---
 I'm not sure how exactly i did it, but i did it. What happened, or what i'm assuming happened, is the staircase, the one that has a floor with it was messing with that area somehow and so i stored some floors and rotated it and then it let me place the thing down. After that i reverted the stairs and the floors to the way they were.
---
I noticed that too, I was hoping it might be addressed in 9.5 but I suppose support tickets must be raised...

---
Agreed! I love the red barn look, but the broken windows make my soul hurt. This much unbroken glass in the game, but I can't have a proper window?
---
Outfits? Or under armors?
---
That kinda is my workaround, but I would have to wall off the ugliness in two places! And don't really have enough budget to do that...
---
Consider me damned as well.
---
This! Yup, I killed the one in the earlier challenge but this one it says to just shoot it isn‚Äôt working. 
---
I‚Äôve hopped servers now a few times and even used a basic and upgraded syringer.
---
Any suggestions
---
Ya know, Finster...I apologize for my saltiness.  I've read back over your comments and have a clearer picture of what you're saying now. The majority of players seem to prefer PvE, but changes are constantly made to PvP which also affect the PvE world.
---
I'll give the you the main 3 characters:
---
Sandy: "That boy ain't right". No concept of the value of money. His vendors are priced according to how much he values stuff, not how much it's worth in the "meta". Toys he likes are high value. Rifles and such are boring. Ammo? No value to him. Melee only, and the more brutal the weapon the better. Serrated edges, spiky bits. Booze and drugs and junk food... the more the better. Lives in an abandoned warehouse, in the crawlspace on the top floor.
---
Doc Geiger: Energy weapons mostly. Does carry a .44. Maxed INT and Cha. All CHA points are put into group buffs and healing. Always hunting for plans for techy-stuff. Has little interest in low-tech items. Always picks the "techiest" mods he can for weapons, even if they aren't the best meta-wise. Lots of chems, but only the medical stuff... none of the wasteland dirt-drug crap or booze. though he'll happily sell it to any wasteland scumbag that wants it. Imagine the doctor from American Horror Story: Asylum and you're close. His CAMP is an old barn... locked tight upstairs, which is his personal "LAB". He's also for hire to anyone with enough mats or caps, that needs a field medic. (shares a 15% XP bonus with anyone that teams up with him... and all his healing skills are maxed... faster, better, more, etc). Also, loves his syringer. (how's that for a RP chosen nerf)
---
And then there's the "Survival character". Lives way off the  beaten path, where almost nobody visits, ever. Hunts for food. Crafts his own leather goods from hides he collects from animals. Carries standard "woodsman" gear only (rifle, axe, knife, pistol), and keeps his gear light. No outfits, wears flannel and jeans underarmour, and a toque. Avoids contact with others in the world until he is sure of who they are and what they want. He's a hunter, a trapper, a craftsman. Imagine a backwoods hunter/trapper of today, eschewing societal contact... and just place him in the post-apoc world. Nothing has changed really... the animals are just uglier and the water tastes worse.
---
Of all of these, "Sandy" is probably the best equipped for the actual "Game of FO76"... high damage, high health, well equipped to just go and survive along the way... food is everywhere, and his endurance helps out a lot. The Mad Doc is a bit tougher... his focus on team dynamics means he's kind of weak, but he CAN do it solo... it's just a really tough game. But high reward.
---
The survivalist is a lot of fun. He's like the Mario of the Fallout world... well balanced, but not great at anything, well equipped but not OP... he's the least "fantasy" based, most grounded in "reality" (relatively speaking). He's a lot of fun to play.
---
Yea
---
When was the last time everything was balanced or mostly working in any BGS game? Most people never realized how absolutely broken Skyrim is. It was mostly fine before since everything was a solo sandbox, but now that it's multiplayer, the issues are amplified.
---
Example of people who wouldn't have survived Super Mario Bros on NES back in the day.
---
Yeah, at 203 (204?), I can squeeze out a level a day if I keep at it, but it's mostly an every-other-day event now.
---
The silver lining for me has always been that I don't find many items appealing in the Atomic Shop.  I don't buy pricey Power Armor skins.  I usually want for sales.  And thanks to data miners, I can sort of plan ahead for anything I'm interested in.
---
Learn new stuff every day from this sub.
---
Well, at release Bethesda's best guess was that it would be a year for private servers and mod support.
---
Given the...state...of the game at release, it seems likely that they may have had to push their timetable back a bit (three months?) for bug fixes and such.
---
So the earliest I would expect private servers is February 2020 or so.  It will likely be delayed further, though I won't speculate as to whether the delay will be due to legitimate issues or concerns about the state of the ATOM shop.
---
I should have specified. I'm talking about 3* God roll type trades. Explosive, 25 ffr.
---
What I'm suggesting is that for someone looking at a trading a high end weapon or 25k+ caps for an AAE...... May want to instead consider picking up a QE for a fraction of the price. 
---
I'm someone who is looking from a value perspective, and if you plan on running a drum mag on the AA you need to ask yourself how much more are you paying for that extra 10% and is it worth it???
---
Nice username

---

---
Just out of curiousity, what price are you selling your 2\* items at?
---
sweet!
---
There‚Äôs one that says kill and another that says shoot. I did the killing one and now the other doesn‚Äôt work.
---
The pros and cons of the nerf debate are as old as time. While I don't ever do PvP, I been in mmos and survival genre games lots to know that once the nerf gun starts hitting things to balance the game in PVP, it ends up rendering builds and enjoyment and playstyles completely useless in PvE as a side effect. You can say it happens the other way around also but hardly ever does a game with PvE and PvP modes "balance" with thinking about PvE and PvE metas.  
---
It's why I don't like nerfing as solutions so much as I like buffing other builds, weapons, ways of playing, and such like to help ppl have more choices.  So if these legacy weapons are a problem and it gets unfair b/c they're unobtainable, can't they just lock the legacy weapons from being used in PvP mode?  Would that be better than nerfing?
---
Same on xbox here
---
Please dont use melee on Scorchbeast Queen! Clearing mobs is coo but time to bus out the big guns! Not upset but with never ending mobs and the event being timed I try and blast mobs when I can and unload on the Queen! The faster she goes down the less repair kits we use!
---
and? So be it. It's free shit. and none of it matters. it has zero effect on gameplay.
---
What they're saying is "hey, here's a goofy-ass challenge that might net you some free shit from our store full of pointless goofy-ass cosmetic stuff".
---
Shhh don't say Gatling Plasma. We don't need anymore nerfs in pve. We're all gonna be using rocks and sticks soon.
---
I just don't loot until an event is over. The meatpiles will stay, and then no one can take your stuff.
---
for the horde
---
"forcing"
---
That word don't mean what you think it means.
---
I got it to work after coming back later. Trying to join one now.
---
Well for free range in paradise, a team is reqlly needed to complete it. Especially when the brahmin deside to seperate. I'd really like to see an option for event announcements, so you could pick which to get the alert for. Plus in the events i had mentioned, they have exclusive rewards you can only get by completing them and usually requires full completion with every creature surviving for the best rewards.
---
Clown daddy, is that you?
---
One event and i have all the steel i need for the week. Love it.
---
They go instantly because of guys like me. I buy them in mass for that price. I can't carry more than 25k caps. But i can store 500 caps for one serum. That's my math but well it depends. Some are after the quick I'm for the long term.
---
I agree damage is nowhere close but it is very fun to play and the weapons are cheap. Wearing a hazmat suit makes armor repair almost 0. I did a little write up about it before if you want to give it a go.
---
I see what you are saying, but its a plan, so once its used its gone. Does not matter how it came about, its value is still the same. I did make a ticket for it though a few days ago, never got a reply on it though.
---
Solo should easily get 30-40 from my experience.
---
Vampyric Powerfist 40% swing speed plus one str
---
From a certain point of view, yes. Ain't wordplay fun?
---
thanks XD
---
Proximity is also in play here.  If you are on a team, and a team member kills something a good distance away, you still get no loot.
---
I was just going to say that. I'll give you an up vote for the numbskulls who down voted you.
---
Just a fyi that any that say kill X with X you can bash it while the item is equipped. :)
---
How far?
---
Learn something new every day... Thank you!
---
I've chopped mine down to 50 each, which is more than plenty to fix and add things.
---
Yea but its cost alot of caps to redo it. So nobody does anymore
---
Probably not a good idea if we're supposed to repopulate the wasteland
---
I only buy 1-Star Weapons. It's far easier to use Xbox's LFG to look for legendaries.
---
it's like a drifferent game now, thank you very much
---
It does not, you have to be outside your PA and without any clothes to be considered naked. I wonder if OP had left their armor before finishing the event
---
The thing is its very specific PvP-focused weapon that in PvE is a nonexistent, ignored niche, and in PvP defines meta obtainable only for the most dedicated players, usually through shady trading channels.
---
At its core, its the same game engine so its quite easy to have it here from fallout 4 sources.
---
The assaultron recall cards are located in the misc tab of most vendors. Standard pricing is ~2400 caps. You can get this down to ~1700 caps with perks and chems.
---
Wish I saw this yesterday! I got a 3\* and sold it for 300 caps to the first lucky customer visiting my CAMP.
---
I initially had trouble too due to things like fusion cores, ammo, and health items. I had to go through each category and really look at the weights and amounts because it‚Äôs very easy to accumulate stuff you don‚Äôt need without noticing as much as with junk. Also, periodically double check that all the junk in your stash has been scrapped down. Unscrapped junk can slip by and add up.
---
Awesome stuff!
---
Great question.  I can use Whitesprings as an example.  If I kill the honeybeast next to the sulfur fountain, my teammates near the bus in front of the golf club are too far to be able to loot it.
---
Also check shopping mall vendor in whiteshprings they may have it also. Otherwise scan people's vending machines.
---
If PvP had to rely entirely on skill for it to be playable or acceptable for someone to enjoy, most MMOs wouldn't have PvP. Although fallout isn't an MMO for say it runs on the same rpg factor of your build and gear choice. No one needs the ability to 360 noscope 1 shot someone as a level 6 because he has good aim. Just not the kind of PvP this is, hopefully a no vats, no legendary mode, will surface however I believe pvp builds will always be a thing and always reign over the others when it comes to PvP.
---
Have you tried fast traveling to a nearby location and walking from there? I‚Äôve seen many people saying that it‚Äôs the fast traveling straight to the location that is an issue.
---
Once your base is pretty much how you want it the day to day levels of junk don‚Äôt really need to be more than 100 of each with just a few exceptions, if you use automatic weapons you might want to have extra lead and steel plus cloth and acid to make gun powder. Ballistic fibre is worth hoarding if you don‚Äôt use P.A, things like gold and silver I only keep 50 of each because it‚Äôs so plentiful, I have 20 bone and 8 coal just to rustle up the odd mutation serum that calls for it but that‚Äôs it, for most folk 100 is the magic number
---
Stop selling plans that are found on NPC vendors for the listed price!
---
I'm looking for a deal and if I buy the same plan from a vendor I can recover some of the cost by selling unwanted items back to the vendor.
---
LFG? What is that?
---
I'm trying to not buy any weapons from anyone. I just want to find them for free
---
If the RNG is pulling from a complete pool, some say 300,000 different possible legendary combinations, the chance to get two identical prefix is tiny, let alone five to a dozen in a row. I also get exact same item from two legendary enemies in a row, recently two Zealots‚Äô black powder pistols, two hunters LMGs, two nocturnal golf clubs, etc. Again if it‚Äôs true RNG, the chance for this to happen is tiny tiny. Yet it keeps happening. That led me to believe the pool for each server is quite small.
---
The update before this one clarified that the flatwoods monster counts as an alien
---
My current character plays yolo bloodied non-VATS combat shotgun. It's good fun, murders a room full of gutsies and assaultrons in a couple of seconds, carries queens, and I don't care about PvP.
---
I used a lot more stealth when levelling. It's almost essential when you're trying to do Whitesprings and Top of the World quests before level 30. Never used a suppressor though. They cut the range too much.
---
How about both *new* and *old ?*
---
Gotcha, I must have missed that in the patch notes. Thanks for the info!
---
Can ^I ^^have ^^^a ^^^^go?
---
I try not to get to a total of 700
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
This is not fallout 4 , mods in a multiplayer game are cheating in all senses of the word . So dont bother crying when hopefully they  perma ban you for cheating
---
Youre really gunna try act like it doesnt effect gameplay? Repair kits...i do not need to even go into that one, but yes things like camp items do effect gameplay in the sense that there is nothing to do in this dam game accept build camps and grind events! And im sure you are aware of all the other things datamined coming under "utility" in the shop like fridges. You cant tell me that wont effect gameplay.
---
500-1000 caps depending on how big each effect is.
---
You can also get possum badges from the scout dailies and the campfire tales event. It is a random drop chance, supposedly, but I've gotten at least one a day from the dailies.
---
Kys
---
Beats the broken system and rids the stash of weight. 
---
I'm on the fence with my 5mm, got 16k I've gathered (never had crafted it) but I do occasionally like to pull out a heavy. Got a TSE Minigun off the SBQ last time I ran it, another one was called in immediately after and got to use the gun...way too fun.
---
Gotta lay off the brahmin milk.
---
Yeah I think it is only a problem when they're lots of people trying to join it. I got it to work earlier but only two other people were there.
---
It just says shoot, not kill.
---
That makes sense. Distance should do that though. If I kill something in Watoga and my teammates are at Arktos, I shouldn't get loot. But there would be a certain distance which that becomes a thing.
---
Yeah I'm just running with the fact somebody got one as a drop from the new event and posted the pic in here
---
Maybe but more new content
---
I dont know about the downvotes, its fair to ask for examples
---
Or find someone who hasn't done it yet
---
I kind of think the other way. I want the legendaries list to be parred down. I don't want legendary rolling pins. I think the Nocturnal effect should go away. Legendary drills seem like a nice idea, until you get 20 junk ones and there's one you want and you never ever ever get it because you keep getting Nocturnal 1\* golf clubs.
---
5 Bulk each maximum.  For the non-bulkable, no more than 100.
---
it's pure RNG. Stats don't help, just like they don't help with in-world item gen (beyond INT affecting durability)
---
Selfish much? Hurr durrr a 5 second notification on my screen is too intrusive hurrr durrr. Think about the majority who actually are playing the multiplayer game. Go back to fo4 they are making a 76 mod for it
---
I'm thankful for people like you lol. I can't get rid of caps fast enough. Dunno what to do with all of them anymore. My mules are full and I'm up to 23k again on my main. Had to turn off my vendor machines and unlist everything until I can find something to buy. I've already bought all the plans from each vendor and have all the weapons I really want/need.
---
I got one from her, it was trash so I scrapped it.
---
I've not tried it yet but have seen a few posts saying it's bugged.
---
Yeah, they get a free one lol.
---
This is a great tip, thanks! I wonder if it would work on Project Paradise?
---
What's the male equivalent to a "Karen"? Cause I bet he wants to speak to your manager.
---
&gt;So if the loot isn't worth the value, why the outcry to have it as a passive? You're basically saying that you want to unlock the door for the sake of unlocking the door.
---
Because the loot isn't worth it and they are far more common then other similar utility perks. Combine with the fact the game forces you to max out combat or you go though supplies faster then you are realistically capable of making replacements.
---
&gt; I don't swap out, I currently run a tank/utility build.  
---
Then a passive wouldn't make your build just like mine so that entire argument is asinine.
---
My guess would be because of Atomshop reasons because as soon as people could host their own servers it wouldn't take long until you have custom modded servers that add everything you would otherwise need to buy or have to wait for Bethesda to implement like some upcoming events which are already in the files or even the text chat mod or refridgerators.
---
yeah true but right now all my armour has 20% weight reduction and I literally had over 40 weapons on me at all times but when i put on my power armor for arkos my carry weight is over 700lbs.
---
Shhh. Listen. Can you hear it? That scraping sound? And the heavy footsteps? Bethesda just picked up the Nerf Hammer, and it is coming...
---
Issue i have is the Dailies used to be fairly easy. You could knock out the 10 Atom ones in about an hour. They had some 20-30 that were a bit more of a challenge but lately they seem to be all but impossible on most of them and their rewards dont reflect that fact.
---
Me n my crew have been herding the friendlies to corners or pipes then putting our power armors down so they cant wander off.
---
Agree with all of that... I think there is less of that now at least. And the volatility has lowered a good amount. Constructive criticism is great if there is something wrong or something you want to see change.
---
For a long while back in the november-jan time I was really seeing ppl cussing out and yelling at our community devs in replies and personal extreme hostile insult stuff. There's just no need for any of that, it's so toxic and unhelpful and plain assholeishness.
---
Ooh, I didn‚Äôt know that, thanks for telling me :)
---
Ah well I guess bashing it to death could be cathartic if it's not registering the hit?! XD
---
What do you mean? I have tried going to Arktos and going down the elevator for an already started event. Do you mean a different location?
---
Explore everything. Canned dog food is your friend. Loot everything, sell or scrap the stuff you don‚Äôt want.
---
Except they do... granted, they only show up with your weapon/armor is right about to break. Red icons in the lower left of the screen under the AP bar with a broken pistol or broken armor symbol.
---
I literally make up prices out of my ass.
---
I recently had Fusion Cores that were as many caps as it had % left charge.
---
Armor isn't as sexy as weapons so it always lags behind...that said give us helmets w/ DR , ballistic Shields and other cool stuff damn it lol.
---
It's like skyrim 100 sneak sometimes. I can crouch in front of a group of enemies and pick them off without being detected though they can clearly see me
---
And if your into smg‚Äôs. Don‚Äôt get the perfect storm until 50.

Gunsmith
---
That‚Äôs why I am so hesitant to even try anymore. The only semi safe bet would be being teamed up, because then the workshop just transfers to your teammate. Otherwise, it‚Äôs such a gamble that it isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
I did that in my death maze lol. The fall won‚Äôt kill you? The 2 deathclaws at the bottom might!
---
Agreed
---
Why on earth would u need... ya never mind I have 54 chassis on my character always lol I get it
---
Welp. That depends. Is what you have now usable? Is it a good 1-2 star with a decent legendary affect that does a decent amount of damage that would be supplemented by a good second or third star, or are you running the best trash gun you've looted so far?
---
Because...yeah. If you're running a gun that doesn't cut the mustard, roll 2's until you get something that melts face, then roll 3's to get something truly epic.
---
No point in bulking anything but steel and lead as those are the only two that actually weigh less bulked. You're just wasting plastic unless you're planning on vendoring excess junk.
---
Same and ive played 250+ hours. Been trying to do Queen of the Hunt lately in hopes one of the Cryptids is the Flatwoods Monster so i can check off like 3-4 challenges. Have issues getting the event to trigger though so ive only done it 3 times. Snallygaster x2, and Grafton Monster so far üòë
---
Have that, my be laser rifle is a tank but it breaks after about 6-8 reloads, Idk what to do.
---
the trivial "Dear Bethesda, We need glitter skirts right now!!" posts aggravate me beyond reason
---
Buy 40 repair kits
---
Yeah, you sound like the kind of person that thinks they‚Äôre a good guy, but then argues with people on the Internet. I‚Äôm gonna walk away from you now.
---
I would love to see a Squad base loot.  If someone on your team tags or kills something you should be able to get loot from it.  Would need to have some range restrictions.  Can't be in different areas of the map and just get exp and loot.  Though if the system has this the range needs to be enlarge a bit more.
---
Yeah absolutely, I work in retail as my main job and I can say first hand that the shittier the customer, the less help they're given, to the point where 1 guy started shouting at one of our managers about the dates of milk we had on the shelves, we were in the process of bring up some fresh milk from the warehouse but another manager who had to deal with him told us to wait out on the milk so he doesnt get the satisfaction of fresher milk, fuck that guy (and fuck people who abuse other people for no good reason)
---
No, you can see it when you buy it.
---
Thank you for the advice, I will put it to good use.
---
haha im sorry i actually completely overread that thing about non stealth :D well if you are not into stealth i guess the only armor that could give you a "damage boost" wood be to go with bolstering and find the adrenal reaction mutation so your armor allows you to do a bloodied build i guess
---
Should be a red gun/shield icon above your ap bar (appears alongside your well fed/hydrated buffs)that shows if your weapons/armor are close to breaking.
---
But i do agree that your weapon durability should be shown as a small meter so you can actively track your weapon degradation
---
Wear clothes. Never accept chems from strangers. Sneak at all times.
---
Human trafficking is a very real, very active, part of the game, and you don't want to spend your first 60+ hours of the game "working" to pay off your debt to some pimp. Afterwards, your character will never have the same "virgin" walking animation, as when you're a fresh faced, vualt newbie.
---
Learn from our mistakes!
---
This really should apply to any event that flat out requires a group to have a prayer of completing it.
---
Blizzard has no issues doing it...ever.  Not that hard to check who is in the areas and if they did x or y - same shit as tagging boss but now update that horrid code to flag you for a boss drop if he goes down.
---
There is no reason it doesn‚Äôt happen except shit base code that was under developed and for which this tiny ‚Äúteam‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have the time or willingness to address. 
---
Truth in a nutshell.
---
I don't have that issue
---
I dont mind seeing people ask for shit hell, i do it all the time, what I dont like is the attitude some people seem to have when they do it, like, there a difference between "Can you make me a coffee please" and "Make me a coffee!"

Sweet! Thank you!

IGN? If you have cheap stuff I would def come and buy
---
I've always worn the 76 Vault under armor and slowly have upgraded it to whatever it's max is over time.  I didn't even think that's why they called me a vault dweller since I've never used anything else.  Nifty.
---
If your going for auto, Quad ffr, for sniper IE, for just running around AAE/TSE
---
For me bloodied since I keep health below 20% with all the appropriate perks to boost

Catpants. Mainly in at night and open to changing prices.
---
based on your play style you will need more or less of certain items. I'm a ranged gun build, so I mostly need springs, steel, lead, and some screws. You don't ever really need more than a hundred of anything except lead and steel. Stuff like wood, glass, cloth, etc you can just keep like 50 or so because you can always loot more whenever you need it. Learn what you use on a regular basis and keep a decent bit of that, and a minimal amount of everything else. Once you get to a higher level you will spend far more space on legendaries
---
Some basics I can think of are:
---
Wood is available from fallen logs in the forest...sounds like a no-brainer but it is surprising how many people don't figure that out right away.
---
Don't forget to keep your armor and weapon leveled...check every 5-10 levels depending on the gear. Scrap all extra fear at first - that's how you learn weapon/armor mods.
---
In Flatwoods, there's a gym with weights.  This is a superb source of lead for lower levels until you can get Excavator Power Armor and mine ore later on. 
---
Explore. Lots. Bethesda has a lot of hidden easter eggs and cool items, scenery, etc. scattered around...have fun finding it all. Use photo mode and the in-game camera (once you complete the quest) to take screenshots.  They show up on the loading screens.  New locations give XP too.
---
Morgantown Airport is a great low level source of XP and guns from the Scorched there...I'd suggest heading up there at about level 10. Nearby, across from the train station,  is a field with mutfruit, tatos, corn, pumpkin, and razorgrain to help keep your food stocked. 
---
Don't be super afraid to experiment with perks, or grab one that benefits you at lower levels. Once you hit level 50 you get the chance to purchase additional perks or move 1 point into a different S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attribute each level after that. It's pretty easy to change later on if you don't like how your build turned out.
---
As suggested earlier,  some quest rewards are set depending on the level you complete them at. It's not a super huge deal as you can find legendary weapons later on that may be better, but some of those rewards are pretty great if it's a weapon you use. I would suggest Googling a bit to determine if your preferred weapon build has a quest that rewards a weapon in that class and holding off completing that quest until you are over level 50.
---
Having said that, do specialize in one category of weapons as far as perks are concerned.  At higher levels you may have issues with some mobs if you're too diversified.
---
I am sure I'm probably forgetting something...
---
Have fun &amp; welcome!
---
Yes! #fuckchad lol
---
I can‚Äôt do the really low health thing. I panic if my health goes down even a little bit.
---
Got it. I‚Äôll add you soon.
---
FREE (legendary) WATOGA!
---
But i wonder how the nuclear winter challenges were assigned like this ... Sure things can be badly translated (for exemple some years ago, translation in warframe (in french at least) were litterally something you had on google) 
---
But challenges objectives for content not even out, i'm curious how it end up like this :3
---
How much do you sell the sheepsquatch Weapons with mods for?
---
A picture of a player in a space suit fighting an alien.....
---
I‚Äôve got a furious one, I don‚Äôt know the numbers but it‚Äôs a beast when it gets up to speed. Took down a legendary sheepsquach yesterday solo with it. (And a lot of ammo to be fair)
---
Wait. You can get a free one? I've done the event when it popped up. 
---
Finished the quest that leads you there.
---
Never started the event itself but never got a free one.
---
Is it only if you haven't even joined the event someome else started?
---
I had something very similar with watoga being filled with gulpers. The Horde boss was stuck on a roof so for over 2 hours gulpers just filled the streets
---
Ahhh. You are getting scrip hunters, especially on the cheaper priced items. 
---
Because scrip value increases more per star, people will target cheap 2 and 3\* items, especially weapons, to maximize scrip. 
---
For example: yesterday I bought a 3\* assassins blah blah bland 0.44 pistol for 500 caps. I then turned it into 40 scrip. I also bought a few other cheap items for scrip as well. I was near cap max and needed items to scrip, so I bought a few items on the cheap and turned them into scrip.
---
No problem and I hope it works out for you. üòÅ
---
I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúentirely‚Äù. 
---
Pvp by its very nature must be skill based. It‚Äôs inherently competitive. Even the most casual pvp is primarily skill based. Which is different than saying it must be fair, or perfectly balanced, which it doesn‚Äôt have to be.
---
Yeah it's ridiculous. Do you have the beam splitter?
---
How about an event, 
---
The event would be called "Search party" and it would be for the BOS. You would get an alert that a BOS squad has went missing and you have to find scorched in BOS uniforms and a final boss of one in power armor. 
---
The rewards would be BOS uniforms and a chance at legendary power armor.
---
If you can find a QE cheap, then fair enough. AA vs QE is an interesting tradeoff if you're not investing points in Demo Expert or Adamantium Skeleton though. Depends how good you are at staying out of your own blast radius.
---
Yeah, my rifle said it does 109 damage but it does a hell of a lot more than that
---
The broken pro snap camera also frequently appears in toolboxes now. Check your misc section and you may already have one. I have 10 that I can‚Äôt give away.
---
No need to apologize.  But you are a good person for doing so.
---
Wait what?
---
I sell my plans for 20% of it's value.
---
This was downvoted less than I thought it would be.
---
I did that too (except for things like ultracite, ballistic fiber etc), and it made a huge difference... until the usage just crept right back up again.  We will always fill whatever we're given.  But I still would like 1000 please :)
---
Depends on how you're going to play. Bloodied is best for raw numbers under any circumstances, two shot is good when paired with explosive, anti-armor is better with fire rate for an automatic (since the lower per-shot damage is not as big of an issue), quad is also good with fire rate for an automatic, furious would probably be better with fire rate to hit that damage boost faster. Generally, you would want explosive on a hardened receiver to max out per-shot damage and ammo efficiency, and fire rate on an automatic to maximize DPS without caring about ammo
---
Well, I have a BE vicious lever action rifle. I also have an AAE combat shotgun and AAE handmade rifle.  Pretty decent weapons. Not sure I would pay $25K for any of them nor would I sell them for that much if so inclined.
---
So before you ever go to camp venture or even start the brotherhood quests, you can get technical documents that stack since they arnt quest items yet.  Once you have a bunch of them stashed  (in my case I have 9 in my stash that never get consumed) once you get to the point where you can start collecting tech data as a quest item, it acts like I always have one on me. So I hand In the tech doc. Complete the quest, get the rewards, server hop and as soon as I spawn I can go and hand in another doc. Rinse repeat. It's the whole reason I made this post is because I have endless tech docs and yet no paint.
---
I throw ‚≠ê in legendary vending machine and get script.
---
I sell  ‚≠ê‚≠ê/‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê in my vending machine.
---
If its a good gear I keep it or replace the current one.
---
I just want caps mostly.
---
Yeah, before i took out the perk card i ate 3 people on various events. Including one in a clown dress... He tasted funny.
---
Teach me! How does one acquire such magic?
---
Yeah i have a tse laser and it breaks really fast as well. Mainly due to the beam splitter mod and the explosive effect. There's not much you can do besides using another mod or using gunsmith and the luck perk that repairs your weapon
---
How good is your aim? Lol.
---
If your CAMP is built, follow the 100 rule, personally I do 30, but I‚Äôve cured my hoarding. Baby steps. 
---
Remember‚Äîyou only have so much scrap because you DON‚ÄôT use it. 
---
Keep no more than 100 of any individual scrap item. 
---
If you get more than that and you don‚Äôt use it regularly, bulk it (if necessary) and vendor it.
---
If you do use an item regularly‚Äîlike steel, plastic, lead for ammo‚Äîjust use it up until you‚Äôre down to 100. 
---
Bulking is only useful for vendoring. Yes, it saves weight on lead and aluminum, but if you‚Äôre only keeping 100 of each it‚Äôs not going to amount to anything noticeable and is just a waste of plastic. 
---
Eventually you‚Äôll cut down to 50 of each, then maybe even less.
---
it always was. 1 point of damage means 1 point of physaical armor damage
---
All in all, a 100% successful trip!
---
I only had an issue with one enemy and I couldn't tell if it was just because I was slightly in the wrong zone, so I moved the enemy corpse with explosives and it cleared up.
---
No other issues. My camera is modded with the 105 lens and white croc skin.
---
Not a problem - good luck out there
---
Yeah I might sell it because repairing is just to costly
---
so malware bytes is not an antivirus its anti malware.
---
i'd check to see if you have a virus, keylogger app on your pc.
---
i use mcafee, i suggest you do the same.
---
good luck.
---
Report them for griefing honestly. Not the best solution, but it's the only tool Bethesda have provided so far.
---
Yeah, but this is just another day in West Virginia.
---
At the end of the questline, you get a free card. It doesn't matter if you have done the world event, it is part of the final quest tree.
---
Hasnt happened to me, just sounds like poor planning
---
That's different and you know it
---
Crazy question but were you at the right event? People seem to get that and guided meditation mixed up.
---
Thank you! What about explosive and stagger/injure? I heard twoshot explosive is great for stagger.
---
Put in a check that won't let you pick up duplicate keys, and then do a one time purge of duplicates in everybody's inventories.
---
As a horder and trader myself. I have an extra account with mules for everything, from junk , ammo , clothing , legendaries , aid. Well 2 junk characters since i have 10k+ of junk items.
---
Yes fast travel to like Greg‚Äôs mine supply down the hill and then walk up the hill to Arktos Pharma - this May solve the crash - it worked for me but not for everyone
---
The best/most reliable way to keep your energy weapons from breaking is combining these perks:
---
* Slugger(+Expert/Master)
---
* Martial Artist
---
* Incisor  
---
* Bloody Mess
---
* Adrenaline
---
* Tenderizer
---
* Pain Train
---
Then equip an Axe (I like Fire Axes personally, but you do you...)  
---
Screaming vile obscenities while swinging it is optional, but recommended.   
---
Yep i don't use it either, it's ridiculous. I feel like they should just nerf the dmg and buff the durability
---
Thanks manüòÖ
---
No worries. Yeah the questline gets you a free one. But in my experience those new to the qhest line use the card unknowing of what they're about to bring. Lol
---
Make sure you break everything down to its base parts and keep Aluminium and Lead bulked. High use items such as steel, wood, springs, and screws keep a decent amount for repairs (100-200). Things like cork, gold, silver, glass, etc can be kept in small amounts (like 20-30). Get a feel for what you need and how fast you acquire it.
---
I assume it will crash in a session, to avoid disappointment.  ü§™
---
Newbies don't realize that they need to tag a ledgendary monster. I was doing the mole miner one last night and i would tag it and wait but the lv24 guy just hide in upstairs hole in the wall. I was trying to be nice but he missed out on the drops because I could just let the miner linger.
---
You on ps4? I'd love to come to ur shop
---
Haha I had been a 2 handed melee build until level 110, still use my grognaks axe for close quarters combat
---
I'm not concerned about aim, more so damage. Taking the VATS route gives me perks like +30% while using VATS, as well as stronger critical hits.
---
It would take a lot of rearranging points so that's why I'm somewhat reluctant about doing it, but if it's the best option I will.
---
Thats fine. I dont judge anyone elses play style. My grinds are typically multi-goal oriented. I will grind West Tek and Harpers Ferry. Legendaries go to my shop / scrip and all weapons go to vender bots or scrap (once I have reached 1400 caps). It's maybe 30 minutes of gameplay to do that. Sometimes I will grind a little more if I need some items for scrip or am low of items to sell, but most times I change over to events and general exploring / camp visiting.
---
50-100 rare resources, 200 for commonly needed such as wood. Tbh, most of the time I harvest what I need when I need it. There aren't many resources outside nuke zones that are too rare.
---
Yes. Scrapper perk and all those weapons means a lot of steel, if thats your need.
---
Furious probably goes up to +45% damage, which would make it arguably the best full-health effect for spamming at big stuff. I feel like you'd want something with more ammo efficiency for popping the smaller mobs though.
---
 I think they should just buff durability, the durability makes the weapon almost impossible to use against anything that takes a good few hits to take out
---
Oh definitely.  I just do it so I can better organize things, and sell excess to vendor bots.
---
Anyone else crashing constantly in the new event? lucky to get halfway through before locking up and having to quit the 76 processes.
---
3 Rifleman, 3 Expert Rifleman, 3 Master Rifleman, 3 Tank Killer, 5 Demolition Expert
---
Oh man, it's so obvious. I REALLY need to put a Stash box by my vending machine! 
---
Thanks. I can't believe it didn't occur to me before. :)
---
But it makes total sense. Had I thought people didn‚Äôt get this, then I would have posted.
---
So as a level 5 you would buy a simple pipe rifle for 200 caps?
---
My experience....
---
Guy with AAE 15% VATS wants a specific B/25 Tesla with reload speed or 250 damage resist while reloading. I offered a my B/25/+1 Agility. This asshole doesn't even bother to respond back. I then find 2 more guys with this exact same AAE 15% VATS and obviously they want a Fortune for it.
---
After crunching some numbers I realized that a QE could be had for 10-15k caps. From a value perspective the quad is a better deal.
---
There are two types of people in this world. There's the guy who bets the Patriots to win by 3 points because he thinks they will win.....then there's the guy who thinks the Patriots will win but 3 points is not a good price. 
---
I think you're confused about the topic no the thread. Nobody ever suggested that an quad was better than an AA.
---
in retail, they are referred to as "diane's" usually short haired white suburban women who WANT TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER!
---
Cant really answer that until (we) know more about what you want in a camp:
---
1. Whats your goal - a cool build with a great view, perhaps isolated, or a high traffic spot for traffic/vending?
---
2. Do you want to deal with potentially regularly rebuilding your fancy camp because high level critters spawn nearby and attack it (or they interrupt your craft/repair/scrap sessions) (or destroyed by a nuke) or 
---
Do you want a small, highly (and cheaply) transportable camp that you can setup/use on the fly?
---
and
---
Do you even spend enough time in camp so the nearby spawn point will give you some extra XP?
---
3. Are you constantly low on (material)? or 
---
do you want to sell a particular (material)?
---
4. What area of the map are you roaming in now?  
---
This (may) be relevant if you are regularly over encumbered and want a "safe" location other than train stations or red rockets to scrap, repair, etc, or if you want to vendor stuff you are picking up.
---
5. If you are vendoring, is your target market high or low level characters?
---
(Some people like to build near common nuke zones for high level traffic/vending)
---
I am curious why this seems to be isolated only to some. Me and my pals have not crashed yet. A that does the crash look like? Dashboard? Freeze? DC?
---
People need to learn basic economics.
---
The game already has issues and now any chance of a real economy is long dead.
---
We‚Äôre basically at a pint where your either max caps (the rich) because you got that juicy 3* elite weapon that you duped and/or earned several legit ones and sold them 
---
OR 
---
your dealing with an economy with people who ‚Äú put everything up cheaply‚Äù, which means your poor as hell because your spending a ton of game time getting loot that people expect to basically be given to them and thus can‚Äôt move at reasonable prices.
---
This will kill the game off quicker than shit and it drives me nuts people don‚Äôt see it.
---
I mean, does a vendor have a plan...sometimes?  Yeah.  Sometimes.  What‚Äôs the time your spending server hopping worth? 
---
That has value.  If I put up a plan for 1k that I bought at 500c but it doesn‚Äôt usually show up for an hour or so of jumps, then I‚Äôm still selling it low, but if people keep following this advice it just gets burned in that they should only pay 100c, and that not how an economy functions.
---
I could go on, but damn, I‚Äôm so tired of seeing ‚Äúadvice‚Äù like this and knowing full well how it‚Äôll crash the market in the end and a life support game can‚Äôt take that kind of hit.
---
Love to see Bethesda actually care enough to set a min sell by amount on items to combat this idiocy.
---
I swap it out with my lvl 50 fixer in those cases, maybe one day I‚Äôll find a good two or three star handmade for the job.
---
PC too, wow, that's crazy.  You've gotten really crappy luck then.  I will admit I do have to yell a couple times for people to get on pylons, but invariably it gets done and beaten.
---
I would recommend putting Prime Capacitors on it as well. The Gauss Rifle gets a huge damage buff for that.
---
People like him should be fair game to take out... I'm happy pvo is almost no longer a thing, but those guys should be taken out on sight!
---
yeah it amuses me when people get made and attack you if you dont sell them stuff
---
I couldn't agree more. Last night i triggered the event by taking the elevator then waited 20 minutes in hopes others would join. Only one person joined when it was already a lost cause. I consider myself lucky I made it far enough to have the alpha show up.
---
Holy shit I guess a lot has been added since I played? Haven't heard of any of those events. After playing on PC at university months and months ago I might try and pick up a copy for the ps4 if I can grab a really cheap one. It sounds like the games in a way better state now?
---
&gt; Lvl 35 and 40 items are a little harder to sell unless the effects are really nice.
---
I usually get those, but any item that tops at 45 is almost always 45 on legendary drops. Like the lever action, shotguns, etc.
---
That sounds really cool... Now I want to build my own "test site" camp just so I can nuke it myself. Would be extra interesting if you could aim it precisely enough to only hit half the camp.
---
Out of the loop; what do you mean by nuclear winter? Server downtime upcoming?
---
Theres a super easy solution for this but not the best option, Bethesda needs to make it so we all count as a team during events so no tagging required yet this would likely be the cheapest way to fix it yet has drawbacks as someone could afk or not help but still get rewards and if you don't tag it you don't get the exp. Or second option is to make a scoring system in each event to determine if you passed a threshold to get reward so someone like lvl 1 player can come get free loot and would require all players to assist. Yet I rather prefer 1st option since its going to be a lot easy then making entire new system running in the background recording what your doing in events.
---
Well, it did make me laugh, so there‚Äôs that.
---
i can confirm i see stuff in my quest log about a inferno mk2 power armor skin or gladiator helmet (french ca)
---
Holy bat's milk Batman! Wish I had know this. Going to try this out later. Thanks üòâ
---
I mean in terms of weight management it‚Äôs better to keep chassis if you have spare parts as the chassis only weighs 10, each part is more than that alone. If you don‚Äôt need any extra parts anymore scrap or drop them!
---
Well damn. Don't say anything at all. I mean I guess I could hear you if you want but then that's not me. We all make our own choices and I'm sticking to mine.
---
1000 caps. Sold immediately.
---
Need a booze and chems tab too, or ability for a few optional custom tabs would be great.
---
Bloodied ripper. Ungh so much freaking damage!
---
don't forget demolition expert 5, adrenaline junkie 5, nerd rage 3, tenderisor 3,  tormentor 3
---
What I got out of the article :
---
There are a hell of a lot more peeps playing than I thought.  
---
Game is NOT dead, despite the haters best efforts to kill it.
---
Stock up enough wood and steel to build your base. Then roughly 50 after that. (These are extremely easy to find. No need to board them).
---
Stock up 100+ of screws, fiber optics, adhesive and gears. These are harder to find and used a LOT.
---
Everything else, I keep at 50. No more. Not needed enough to stockpile but enough to need to keep a few on hand.
---
Doing this I have 18 weapons, 3 full sets of armor, almost every outfit in the game, 3k of each ammo, all magazines, all bobbleheads, 100 inert flux (best drink in the game IMO) and still have 200lbs of free unused storage.
---
Calibrated shocks on an excavator armor and you got +200. 
---
Or if you do Unyielding +1 str, and the high capacity backpack, you can get up to +220, it's just more expensive and time consuming. 
---
You could even go for Unyielding +1 str +weight reduction perk. But now this is getting expensive lol
---
But your perks look good for carry weight reduction. You may consider a replacement card for pack rat since you'd want to store the majority of your junk in the event you die. You could do sturdy frame for 2 and 1 other for shotguns or bear arms to reduce the heavier weapons.
---
Ehh?
---
Thatd be awesome!
---
Now I kind of want carpeted doors.
---
Happens to me with cannibal
---
Uranium fever maxes out at lvl 40. You won't get lvl 45 or 50 items. That is the only reasOn that the event is not my number 1 stop on a server.
---
Yeah, I just threw it in my vendor and it was immediately bought. I certainly don‚Äôt need it.
---
no probs
---
Why not?  
---
Graftin is  an evil crossbred beast with daddy issues and you brought your tamed puppy to one of his fits.
---
I mean, animals die easily when domesticated.  The next time you get one, try being mean to it and letting it starve a bit - probably give old Graftin a run for his money then.
---
Just sayin.
---
Yes
---
Damn.  As soon as I got the quest everything I had in my stash stacked :/
---
Right. Im putting all extra PA pieces I have onto chassis for easier storage. Now just have a handful of extra chassis wasting space. I‚Äôll scrap em. Thanks!
---
I could not agree more i did the uranium fever event and the guy who came in killed all 3 legendary bosses before i could hit them (I'm a melee build and had no ranged weapons) but i actively killed the other mobs and protected the extractors and was not able to get any legendaries. Which really grinded my gears. Shout out to Peter Griffin lol.
---
üò©
---
&gt; some rando hero burst in to save the day.
---
And how can you blame them? It's not like this is common knowledge
---
F
---
What level gunsmith?  I run lvl 5 just as a qol perk and don‚Äôt have issues with weapon repairs.
---
I **really** would love to paint the inside of brick walls
---
It‚Äôs just my laser rifle, I also have level 5 gunsmith
---
Everyone joining an event should somehow automatically be on the same team?
---
U can rename it and no one will see them AFAIK
---
Nope, some people are insane. You want to charge 200 caps for a fusion core? No thanks pal. ANY ballistic non ultracite ammo shouldn't go for more than 1 cap. I just bought a BE double barrel for 5k. Would I have spent 10k? Hell. No.
---
Could I have your build when you are done tweaking it, I really want to love the broadsider and I would love to play one.
---
Often i'm given ONE respawn point, a whole maps distance away, costing me 35 caps... and another 35 to get back to where i died!
---
They are good in pvp but nerfing them at all will make them even worse at pve. Anything with a high DR will just eat the lasers as it stands now because armour pen doesnt work
---
Whenever I get a 3\* wood piece I just call a guildy over and give him some free scrip for the day XD sorry for your loss
---
oh man, I hate to be this guy, I never correct people, but I am only doing it to help you, i promise!
---
The word you are looking for is 'keel' like you 'keeled over'
---
Aside from that, that's so lucky for him.  I have yet to get anything good from the purveyor.  I have probably spent 1000 scrip so far, but I am doing all ranged 3 star
---
It would also sadly let dupers hide their cheated inventories, making it even more difficult to spot them.  :L
---
I want glass walls so that my house can be see-thru . It should come in building set with snow white walls for like an institute them.
---
Log cabin stuff for sure
---
Maybe like castle walls like the castle in FO4
---
the possibilities are endless.
---
This is simply not true. I get level 45 items often from the event.
---
AnachronisticUK friending now. Need to revive in kind.
---
I'll buy at 50 caps each.
---
Personally all new events added to the game going forward must have a server wide notification.
---
atom shop paintjobs allow you to do so.. but there is not enough for weapons
---
Just keep using em. Build camps, craft weapons and scrap them for mods, craft ammo and so on and on. It also helps to know that junks are very easy to come by if you actively farm for them rather than playing casual. Why would you hoard those junks when you can gather hundreds of them with in an hour of farming? This mindset helped me a lot with my hoarding problem
---
I‚Äôll help you with that if you can die for me so I can complete it as well. I‚Äôm sitting around the Mothman Monument trying to get that Dead Tourist to spawn. Online ID: ChibaBlackClinic
---
I created a one tile foundation with a floating second floor to alleviate this issue
---
Debating raiders is a hobby of mine. 76 is a mixed bag compared to FO4 where each of the Nuka world raider had a distinct style and full on committed to it. They lived by the code they preached, they had a society a brutal, callous one, but it was there. The raiders in 76 are on the opposite path a side to barbarianism. It is why I call them cowards not because they don't want to fight (fair), but because if you look at sunnytop slopes, they are killing and stealing because they are afraid to work. They were the big rich top dawgs and are so afraid they might loose that that they will burn down everything that is left just so they can call dibs on the ashes. But they are also more human they have dissenters like the ones at Big bend tunnel, and even when they do press on they still have some doubts, it is (somewhat) refreshing.
---
Even if it‚Äôs just different shades/colors of current artwork - it would allow more personalization. 
---
This shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to pull off.. maybe open it up for the mod community to submit different graphics and textures for Bethesda to approve (just to leave them with the control).
---
I know the two shot effect also rapidly affects condition. I saw you use a beam splitter... not sure if it has a similar effect. While it won‚Äôt help with degradation, I always put the weapon stock on that increases condition/bash damage (forget the prefix) just to get more life out of my weapons.
---
Only if you don't already have decent 1-2 star legendary weapons that can get you through, otherwise 2 star rolls are (to my mind) a waste.
---
I definitely plan on doing a set of weapon reduced weight armor, but ther excavator'll be good for nuke zones. 
---
yes please! keys and keycards! actually, wasn't there a key ring in one of the earlier fallouts that did exactly this?
---
Never seen or heard of anything like that
---
Sad, but better than modding a 3 star top tier weapon only to have it disappear.
---
This suggestion would do a lot to ease the tunnel vision that players tend to get when a starred boss appears.  It's a mad rush to get your shots in, lest someone take it out in seconds with a bloodied mole miner's gauntlet or plasma gatling.
---
I don't know how they would implement this sort of feature, since I know nothing about coding (Jon Snow), but maybe being a conduit for at least 30 seconds (I can see what a shitshow this would create if simply taking a pylon and immediately dying would give you immediate credit for boss loot so you can just stand there and camp while others do all the work), or staying within a certain tiny radius of the friendly creature for 30 seconds give you "credit" towards boss loot.  If we could actively use stimpaks on the friendlies in Project Paradise, and the brahmin during Free Range, healing them would be an easy marker for boss loot credit.
---
SBQ doesn't really need the feature, since she's such a massive bullet sponge anyways that you can spend 95% of your time in the event being a team player, then running in when she lands to get your damage on.  Sometimes my melee guy doesn't really have anything to do for a few seconds, so I just pull out a backup 10mm pistol and unload rounds into the flying beast.
---
Thanks for the tip. Is the difference in condition noticeable?
---
Thank you so much! I‚Äôll take all these into deep consideration
---
It logically sounds like you had a pretty unique issue. This many people having trouble with the new event can't all be overclocked too far and have bad RAM. And the rest of the game plays fine for me.
---
If you want a location with level 100+ players roaming all around, the City down here is prime real estate. Look long enough and you will find a place that serves you both ways.
---
Add "quad" to their list of good primary rolls. 4x the ammo before reloading is always good.
---
It's actually a pretty decent sniper rifle. Quad is alright on a weapon with a low clip count, VATS is great on rifles and damage resistance while reloading is good as well. It isn't god tier, but it's good. You can probably get 2k for it.
---
Sorry, I meant being able to pick up a legendary from something I just killed.
---
Hordes can roam freely around the region, so we should be able to just plop down a blueprinted small enclosure nearby, lure it in and block it off. Brilliant idea!
---
My friends all just dump their fusion cores on me because I chew through them like mad.
---
Oof, quite the negative response to your post for asking for something reasonable. I hope they make the terminal allow us to toggle event notifications.
---
Its ER that defends against lasers, its fireproof that defends against incidentary, and its dense and fireproof that defends against explosive.
---
They don't need nerf. They need fix. Their damage is fine, and is not the source of the problem. The fact that they do not loose damage with range is. Noone in PvE world fights at the distances where this is problematic. And the result of this problem is not that you simply get shot - its that you need to walk 150 more meters before your regular guns will be able to register hits on their targets. Were talking at distances between 200 and 500 meters that are the problem. Its PvP-only problem, and fixing it would not influence PvE.
---
If any of my hundreds hours of research into this game suggested fixing the range curve for explosive legacy weapons to work correctly would make them any less viable for PvE, I would never suggest that.
---
Oh weird, I actually tried to shoot him my first day down here and it seemed like he was just immune so I never tried again. I don‚Äôt have capacity for turrets so I never saw that. Maybe you could put roofs over your turrets so they don‚Äôt shoot up?
---
That's why two shot and explosive go well together, it doubles the benefit from explosive because the damage and explosion apply to each pellet.
---
Haha this is genius actually.
---
just because theres a precedent doesnt mean they should do it.
---
I want to say it‚Äôs like +25% compared to the next stock but don‚Äôt quote me on the number. Significant enough I put it on all my guns now
---
Never heard of this issue. Please provide specific details.
---
Is broadsider usable with vats? Last time I checked, it wouldn't do no damage if I hit directly. I had to purposely miss and hit the ground to actually do full damage. My question is, does it do full damage if you hit directly with vats?
---
I don‚Äôt know why I put kisses haha sorry dude force of habit.
---
Let me know if you find it, I‚Äôd massively appreciate it, been waiting to start a new camp but I need the foundation stacking to make it

I assumed that they couldn‚Äôt access the elevator. Interesting.
---
I would love this to happen!
---
Highest potential damage per shot in the game with the right builds.
---
Care to explain? I've done dozens of them and never noticed an issue (pc)
---
Yeah, but then the friendly animals fight the adds. Had this happen with one of the level 1 critters. Sure they get a small heal from that one robot, but of course it died. Few we're helping feed the troughs.
---
Mind sharing your PSN name or sending a DM? Would like to work something out.  Looking for eagle eyes, grounded, scaly skin, and speed demon at the moment; probably 2 or 3 each. Can provide at least some of the flux if that would help.
---
Maybe I had my range wrong. Thx.
---
I am fully aware of this. I have 3 agility. It will not go up anymore.
---
This is just sort of a good general life tip, tbh.
---
Just shows them the true name.
---
Only way to hide them currently is put on a Skin from Atom Shop
---
No, because you have to beat the INFINITE LOADING SCREEN FINAL BOSS before you can crash, and i sure can't do that.
---
I'm from a small island where the whole place is "suburban" so we cant steriotype that type of person here
---
Great job!
---
My favorite part is when he grabs Dogmeat and runs him to safety. 
---
"Come on dogmeat, this place isn't very country roads."
---
This could be it, but I haven't heard of this one yet. I just scroll through all the perk options.
---
I have been on the lookout for a bloodied/explosive/weapon weight missile launcher. You can output WELL over 1.5k damage per shot with the thing, 4 times before reloading, with auto-targeting outside VATS that almost never misses. You can swat Scorchbeasts out of the sky with a single missile. Destroy an entire swarm of enemies in a single shot. Arc missiles over cover to hit hiding enemies. I WANT ONE SOOOO BAD!
---
When it's put bluntly like this it makes you wonder why this wasn't discussed and updated by Bethesda already. I fail 4/5 Free Ranges if I don't focus on the cows 100% of the time. Seeing this be a problem with literally every event that has mobs and a boss shines a light on how much we need this change.
---
UPDATE: I've checked my tadpole challenges, and they say I have 5 agility, while the actual special stats say I have 3.
---

I wouldn't mind a fix to the challenge bugs, seems like I got a bunch of exploration challenges unfinished because I haven't visited X, but I know I've been there, it's tagged on the map, and I can go again and it's still refusing to gimme my challenge atoms. Stingy bugger!
---
Lol i put it in the vendor for 1500. Figure if it sells cool if not ill turn it in when i get closer to stash max.
---
Even less useful than toilet paper. At least you can scrap that for cloth....
---
good advice :-)
---
Indeed I had to rename my BE handmade ‚Äúnot for sale fuck off‚Äù. Since then no one has requested it.
---
I've always thought it was terrible that everything is shown to begin with.  Why would you want to see all my items, it would have been better if I could just show what I wanted to sell versus everything. But it is what they made it but yeah it isn't great.  Of course the item you want is the weapon I'm using because yeah it's a good weapon.  I'm unsure what makes peeps go off the deep end and expect you to give up your main weapon just because they saw it and want it.
---
DogEmeat, please!
---
perfect advice
---
One Violent Night and Uranium Fever are events that I largely avoid because it's so easy to accidentally kill the squishy boss with one hit of a high-end explosive gun.  I try to aim for the feet to just get the critter with splash damage, or throw down a molotov if I have one, but sometimes the creature takes a step back and I get a clean leg shot on it.  I was actively trying not to damage it very much.  It sucks and I try to apologize, but I'm sure people still get pissed.  I drop whatever I get on the ground anyways, so hopefully that's some consolation.
---
I should just grab the guitar sword that's laying near the stage, hotkey it and swap to that weapon when the wendigo appears, or always keep a handful of molotovs for the specific purpose of these events.
---
I'll have to give this a listen to.
---
Yep. The worst is scorched in the Southeast corner of the map. Leads you into the glassed cavern when the boss is actually outside.  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.
---
(Slurping noises)
---
I used to sport quad explosive combat shotgun with perforating mag and noticed it just wouldn't do enough damage when going against high DR enemies like super mutants unless I use vats. Damage output is so low that any amount of armor completely absorb my pellets. Had to lower my health to under 20% to utilize adrenal reaction and nerd rage to do some tolerable damage.. and then I gave up. Low health build ain't my thing
---
nah ima emote her to death! Take that u big bug! Eat my wave! lol
---
My cabin is a shanty hut
---
Glad I could help out.
---
Drugs are bad M'Kay
---
Just drop it at a train station someone might use it.
---
Are you buying the BoS combat armor and generator plans and then reselling at a markup? Otherwise, how are you finding them in game?
---
Might have been me... sorry. Sounds suspiciously like something that happened last week. Lol
---
If you have a lot of ammo I need and it‚Äôs more than 1 cap, I will absolutely bother you to sell all of it at a discount or walk. 
---
If it‚Äôs 1 cap and I‚Äôm feeling lazy?? I‚Äôll probably just take them all and not ask for a better price.
---
Oh we're complaining, it's just that the complaints get drowned out hard with everything else.  
---
Because the complaining gets washed away in the sea of threads I'm not even sure Bethesda knows about the issue.
---
No problem!  Though I liked the direction of the last big RDO update, the thing I mention to people is that RDO can do so much more if it invested in dedicated servers (not gonna happen for RDO).  A good example is the FiveM community dedicated servers for GTA V PC. 
---
Disconnects would be so much fewer and less reliant on other players router configs/shitty internet but the main focal point would be the potential in features/systems, multiplayer stability (if just overtime).  [To this day GTA V suffers from same disconnects like it did in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/b1neo4/getting_disconnected_from_gta_online_lobbies/) but a buggy launch like FO76 is more stable overall today months later.  
---
Lots of people equate it to server costs but thats no longer true in 2019.  Servers are  the cheapest they've ever been and the money R\* makes from shark cards/gold bars would cover it 10 fold.  The expensive part would be the investment in developing the server network code.  However, this investment would also actually simplify the code/bugs for them because it is so much harder to develop missions, NPC interactions, mutiplayer modes in a Peer to Peer system than in an authoritative system like dedicated servers.  
---
/Rant over =)
---
Turns out you have to take a picture of 'something' in a stormy weather
---
Just found a bloodied \* railway rifle for 250 caps. 
---
Bloodied Gatling \* for 300 caps. 
---
Its one of those moments. Mine!
---
"Caps sound"
---
I'll certainly have to schedule a tour of the properties!
---
I ran it ten or so times before the crashing started for me. Personally when I load in after pressing the elevator button, or fast traveling to the event, it just freezes on the loading screen.
---
Good question, I was wondering the same thing.
---
I will never compromise building my camp in a cool location. That‚Äôs half the fun for me. Sorry profits.
---
How is battlefield 5 aggressive MTXs? They are all cosmetic with no loot boxes at all. 
---
Fallout 76 is the game that has repair kits that actually effect gameplay?
---
Oh, I'm sure it's worth it!
---
cause it looks better
---
do you still want them? add me. i was wondering if i should start paying people to just take them, i hate just dropping stuff. i‚Äòm weird
---
anyway, same username in game. mepradayounada
---
It will always be lvl 50 but you can trade that gear on here for other more useful things. General consensus is to go for 2* weapons from the vendor because the third weapon perk is generally useless
---
I get that you should be able to get the loot off of of smaller 3* bosses that people can one hit, but the queen? Really? If you don‚Äôt get at least one hit on the queen the whole quest, you should just put down your game for a while and think about it. All it takes is one little shot or hit on the queen to see loot. That‚Äôs all... that‚Äôs all.. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh boy this is frustrating
---
It's one of the best videos out there.  I'm lvl 200+, played since BETA, and learned a couple new strategies.
---
FYI, if you get a horde that has a really low legendary spawn rate, like scorched, your odds of swimming in legendaries is really, really low.  I did this today in The Mire with scorched and killed a few dozen before getting tired of it and just taking down the boss.  I got a lvl 20 instigating hunting rifle, which was pretty cool.
---
You teleport to them each time and there are no markers, and nothing happens. A few minutes later you get the event completed.
---
I never even get any markers, I just teleport there and nothing happens every single time.
---
My first attempt at this method went that way. Low level wolf, died when I tried to tag it just once. Now I will only gun bash them.
---
You can only buy them with real money and that goes against what they showed us the system would look like at launch, they said we could buy them with company coin, which was a lie, the main menu is covered in ads for them, theyre extremely expensive.
---
I don't understand it either, I have multiple characters - level 80, 68, 35, 14, 14.... if I'm on my 14 what does that matter. 
---
I do a lot of activities that don't earn me tons of XP - does being a lower level somehow mean that my opinion matters less than those who have more levels?
---
Sorry to hear that, that sucks. Try switching servers and see what happens?
---
... must be eating White Castle.
---
Thanks for this, will include in the reposting of this.
---
It goes into the washers, dryers and other containers that we find 1-5 caps in, and caps stashes.
---
To maintain those beautiful roads!
---
Aye, but remember the old maxim: never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence. :)
---
I completely agree! I had a level 235 come into uranium fever and sit in a corner and wouldn't move till the legendary spawned and he would run over and 1 shot the legendary and make a thumbs up emote after. 
---
Same goes with project paradise I had 2 people wait on the balcony spots for people to die then they would hop down and take all of our junk. They only shot the alpha and didn't protect the friendly animal so we ended up failing it.
---
Totally agree. As a sniper, I like hanging back and picking off mobs so the heavy gunners can do their job on the big bad. This would be so great if they could make this work!
---
Xbox?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, I OCD all the time too lol
---
This is great!
---
Your giving advice that, if taken, will help to destabilize and possibly ruin the game man.
---
Silence would be aiding you in this.   I‚Äôd hope you‚Äôd at least take the time to research some basic sandbox economics and just possibly re evaluate your stance, esp as how your trying to convince others of it.
---
I've had it hang once, neverending load screen. And once it crashed while inside the building, but not during the event. The event itself is fun, albeit quite hectic when the gathering phase is active. Too bad there are already people just showing up for the Alpha creatures, and hanging back in the background until the Alpha shows up. Still enjoying the game as a whole, happy with the updates and added content since launch.
---
Last night I dropped in violent night and got 3 separate 3* super muties and ghouls and several 1* ghouls. The rng was strong with this one.
---
It combats inflation to help  prevent runaway prices
---
Less code to write...
---
Thanks. I have been annoyed by people correcting me like that but I appreciate the way you did it.
---
I said what I said in my reply because I want you to realize that you made your own argument for passive lock picking and hacking irrelevant. You want them to change two of the most powerful utility perk cards in the game because you refuse to play a build that uses those few cards over a few other cards that I assume you currently use to maximize your damage, and you are tired of switching to lock picking and hacking cards when you want to access terminals and locked doors. Am I right?  
---
Then, with that being said and agreed on, if you believe that there is absolutely nothing of value behind terminals and locked doors, why do you want them to change two powerful perk cards and potentially change the whole system; including a lot of peoples builds? You need to be honest or find a different excuse as to why you want them to change lock picking and hacking, even if it is because it bothers the hell out of you when you  come across a locked door, chest, or terminal and you can't open it. For whatever stupid reason you still argue you want them as a passive, but tell us that you think they provide you with nothing. I said I completely disagree with you when it comes to their value and the value of what they unlock. 
---
I told you what my build is when I play with my friends, and when I play solo (which I often do in survival) I run a hybrid utility/max DPS heavy gunner build (I'm sure its similar to your max DPS build). If they took away my hacking and lock picking cards because again, you are obsessed with unlocking "useless doors, boxes, and terminals" then I am sure our build would be exactly the same, or rather our damage would be near equal with different types of weapons being the only things to potentially separate the difference between your character and mind. Guess what happens after that, the meta gets much, much smaller and far more boring. Because then, they make a weapon type stronger than another. If we both follow a meta, and are given free utility perks, then our builds would be EXACTLY the same.   
---
Added, who the hell knows what future content will be. Maybe they will add even more value behind doors, and you have to choose what you think is faster for making resources or clearing content, utility or damage. All I have to say is that you are asking them to kill and remove core elements of the game, and it is your thinking and ideals that have completely killed other multiplayer games to satisfy your needs/wants. So many role-playing mechanics have been removed from so many games because elitists want everything; max damage AND the ability to unlock doors, chests, and terminals that they say are pointless but want the ability to do anyways. It kills any future content of what lock-picking and hacking can be used for, and kills the diversity and uniqueness of the game as it has done for EVERY game that has answered the demands to normalize different builds and classes before it.  
---
To you sir, I say. You already have passive lock picking and hacking, at level 0. Deal with it, or invest in the perks to improve it, or keep switching your perk cards and be happy they allow that. For you to refuse to do anything less than max damage AND to cry/ask/demand for them to give you the utility perks you refuse to sacrifice some damage for makes you the asinine that kills ends the diversity and hard to choose options that make games great; ultimately killing the game when they do submit to your illogical nonsense about wanting something you call useless in the first place but can't stop complaining about not having.
---
Todd Howards ass
---
This is so true.  I'll typically make a test run of the Whitespring, usually the maintenance parking lot and interior.  My camp is very close, so it's an easy 1 cap to fast travel to the hotel entrance.  If I don't get anything, I server hop.  Very easy to earn all 150 scrip each day just turning in 1 star gear.
---
Where did you find the FireFly?
---
no, i wish, maybe the framerate would be more stable if i couldn‚Äòt go above 30 anyway. bethesda &amp; framerate, a tale as old as West Virginia. PC here :(
---
Sold a stack of 5x100% for 75c a piece. Just keep them listed someone will come by who needs them.
---
I use both a BE handmade and BE radium. While the Radium does slightly less damage and has 10 less in the stinging clip, it uses .45 ammo which is abundant. I use auto receivers on both and never need to worry about ammo.
---
I've never met a small monster it can't one shot, it doesn't heal ghouls like I've seen many posts claim, the ballistic damage outweighs the radiation too much.
---
It looks and sounds cooler too imo, plus it's not a handmade, so you will almost certainly find it cheaper to buy.
---
Who the hell was buying all those mutton meat pie recipes! looolllll They drop from EVERY SINGLE FREE RANGE EVENT. How hard is it to get one of those!?!? People must be REALLY bad to have to resort to buying it. Or stupid.
---
accepted yourFriend request I\`am online now
---
Not sure about Project Paradise. But I can attest to Brahmin hating our kind, lol. Took me awhile to figure out why the bastards would go hostile on me while I was doing the Pioneer scout challenge to milk brahmin 10x. Went kind of like this : Skulk up sneakily to Brahmin, ready my milking hand and . . . . MoOoOo! Kick! MOoOo! Kick! I imagine it was probably fairly entertaining for others to watch me frantically chase Brahmin all over Flatwoods, desperately trying to get my hand on those udders. Only to get kicked in the face repeatedly. At 1st I thought it was the intended mechanics of doing the challenge. But alas I eventually realized it was my Pig Pen like disease aura that was spooking them. . . Not my cold, shaky hands lol.
---
Psn is same as my reddit user. However i been told before they were unable to find me.
---
Ahhhhh no luck here then, it‚Äôs mostly stable but when shit hits the fan it‚Äôs under 10 fps.
---
Well.... at least enemies can‚Äôt hit you, so there‚Äôs that.
---
My opinions are based on facts. Everyone who have played FO76 know these problems. There is not only few problems. Game is full of bugs and glitches and most of them have been in the game since BETA without any effort to fix them. I understand that you don't care about bugs in Bethesda games. I am sure you have good reason for that. Bethesda worker or just fanatic fan?
---
Looks like you are angry about my comparison to Ubisoft some time ago. Ubisoft is not a perfect, but they are still light year ahead to Bethesda what comes to releasing games as polished as possible.
---
We would be all a big happy family in Fallout world if Bethesda would have honest intent to create a great game instead of making cheap copy-paste product based on Fallout 4 assets. They re-used almost all Fallout 4 assets and just added poorly designed network code. They used as less effort to make new Fallout game as it was possible and this same attitude we can see now when they should fix problems. They rarely fix anything. They just copy-paste more old assets with different color and try to sell them in Atom shop with real money.
---
My herd mentality randomly vanished one day also...I was thrilled...if only empath could take the hint...
---
I think the event completion reward should be the legendary weapon/armor. That way if it fails no one gets anything. No legendary spawn to battle. Depending on how well you do decides your reward. Only one friendly animal survives? Only a 1*. All three make it? 3*. Same for Free Range. It would improve participation and give reason to go all in for that 3* reward other than oh maybe that 3* creature will actually drop a 3* reward.
---
Or maybe the right people just haven't found your camp. I always need cores.
---
It's there way of countering players selling caps
---
Broadsider doesn't benefit from heavy weapons as it's classed as an explosive so only demolition expert counts.
---
70 is min for all and you're good.
---
Steel, wood, plastic min 200-300
---
Keep rare junk like ballistic fiber or screws at ~100.
---
Always scrap all junk and only bulk all lead and aluminium because those are which weight less when bulked.
---
I have a executioners explosive vats crit damage gatling gun for sale at 6k. Do you think that's a good price? It's been in there for a couple days and no bites yet.
---
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any logic with the reward... think it‚Äôs black and white, pass fail.
---
Charity work. I dig it. Thanks
---
That‚Äôs not true you can earn them for free through tides of war.
---
I‚Äôve already earned like 3-4 epic sets by playing tides of war and didn‚Äôt pay a cent for them.
---
Why are you spreading lies? I‚Äôm all for criticizing EA/Bethesda but spreading lies and misinformation is not the way to do that. 
---
And I wouldn‚Äôt call it aggressive if you‚Äôre counting adds. Also cosmetics have no effect on gameplay. So I‚Äôm not sure why you even care.
---
They aren‚Äôt expensive compared to other games. You pay a set price to earn them which is how it should be.
---
In most games with MTXs you‚Äôd have to spend that same amount of money just for a CHANCE to unlock them through lootboxes.
---
You‚Äôre spreading lies to prove a point which inherently makes you mentally ill Seek a therapist.  Mentally stable people can make a point without the need to lie.
---
I am a huge fan of Fallout and have been playing this game since BETA. It is my favorite game series of all. It is the game I have most played since I was 15 years old (I am 33). I made the pre order and also bought ATOMS at the store, but Bethesda does not deserve this incredible community. Every patch a lot of bugs are introduced. Some Scout challenges, released some time ago, are still impossible to complete. The new event freezes every time. After some patch a time ago, these texture problems started to happen. The stash size and CAMP budget are insufficient for high level players, and they did nothing to address any of these issues. After the last patch I was expecting a big list of bugs fixed, but they corrected none of them (only the frog jar). It breaks my heart for saying that but this is amateur work. The worst part is their silence. They are not even capable of communicate and say that they are looking for the bugs to make the fix. For me, the game is in its worst shape since the launch. I am very disappointed with the problems and always go sleep, after a day of work and some playing, really sad about this. It is completely disrespectful what they are doing to this community that loves the Fallout franchise and has invested money on it.
---
Fucking Jesus 44 million Scrip given to the purveyor. It's only been out for 2 weeks iirc
---
Well... I offered 100 scrip to the Purveyor. She said she would give me a special offer if I followed her a while to the back room. And... well... lets just say you are better of just hoping for a good roll. Man, the radiation has not been kind to that old lady.
---
If you're on xbox I can mod it for you. Have all the mods but dense ulocked
---
You are right. Let me spend countless hours on how the price of every item in the game is worth so that I become too absorbed in a pointless system. 
---
Try telling that to every player who comes into the game and wants to be a vendor so that we sell things at the exact same price based on the research that we have to learn.
---
Dude just chill and play the game. If you don't like it then oh well. I'm not responding to your next comment.
---
They mentioned them 2 weeks ago, they are coming eventually, just aren't ready yet.
---
Well I sometimes get flying aggressive SB so the missiles are pretty useful to keep its attention scattered.
---
Bless you fellow support NPC
---
Nice one editing your comment:) and its hardly "tons of free cosmetics" u get two outfits two full outfits worth of cosmetics drip fed to u throughout three bloody months with a couple of crummy gun skins to start.
---
Batteries Included makes them much lighter. I was carrying like 100 cores to make sure my armor and Gatling Laser are kept fed.
---
I just keep two chassis and switch between them. I got some t45 and t51b, plus excavator. I don't care too much for the raider look.
---
It costs alot of caps to do THE IMPOSTER sheepsquatch event. The free range real sheepsquatch event can pop lots of places anytime for no caps
---
LOL.  I thought the exact same thing.  Despite having some morals that I find questionable, like blatantly duping in earlier videos, Rifle Gaming also has some pretty informative stuff.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve started just hanging out at Arktos, too, and seeing if other people will flock in before I start the challenge and have been able to get a small group that way. Now if I could just stop getting lab coats and get my Stimpak diffuser plan that I really want/need...
---
Youre mistaken, the "epic" items obtainable through tides of war are entirely seperate cosmetics from the ones obtainable with the boins
---
Okay I know where you are at now. Geez what a spot to build lol. I would love to see it!
---
I want to reduce weight wherever possible, so I leave my worse weapons at my base, and keep my best, but at least just bash the legendary instead of just ones shotting it.
---
i used to block my stairs with those tall concrete defensive walls. only marsupials or jet packs could get in. one time i came home and someone was wedged in the wall and couldn't get out, and molerats were nearby so they couldn't fast travel away. I removed the wall so they could get out and stopped building like that lol.
---
Hmmm.    I have a BFFR Gauss I never use because the ammo is so heavy.  Would that be a good dedicated SBQ weapon?
---
I've kept my All Rise even though I am shotgun build.  Bought a second one someone sold for the heck of it.  Use it extensively at WS Nuke event after I've done the knee capped the glowing ones.
---
I do wish there was a version that allows you to swing faster.
---
I absolutely love how my post got deleted. üëçüèº
---
I like having it, I'm usually on a team and the +2 strength is very useful for all my melee options. I bought the serum 4 times from player vendors for it to keep leaving.
---
ah i didnt even think of that at all, pity that is even an issue still...
---
We know amylou - we're from the same vault remember? lol
---
But nevertheless we all appreciate your contributions.
---
Never change amylou, never change.
---
Absolutely.  The last thing anyone wants is to make a mistake and have people get stupid about correcting you.  It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt had it happen to me too!
---
Good luck in the wasteland!
---
the same place odd socks go?
---
Please do! Let me know what you think. It's my first podcast.
---
To those downvoting, explain how the system would possibly work.
---
Event reward loot is static. That means everybody gets the same items in the event reward pool. Were legendary items included in the event reward pool, it would be the same exact legendary item for everybody. While I'm sure people would love the fact that RNG wouldn't exist, I doubt Bethesda would be handing out a quality 3-star legendary. This weapon would also drop in value with how many would flood the in-game market.
---
Enabling enemy specific loot without tagging enemies would require doing so everywhere in the game. This would increase server load on a server already being propped up by gum and paperclips. It would also flood the game with more items, requiring Bethesda to include more item sinks to remove items out of the game, along with balancing drop rates in a way that won't cripple the in-game economy. Player progression would also require significant balancing.  
---
The point is, what you want just isn't feasible in an online game. There's a reason why you don't see successful MMOs and online games doing what OP has suggested.  There's no magic switch here to enable what some of you want. As much as I shit on Bethesda, and I do a fuck-ton, how they're doing it now is the right way to do it. There's not much they can do for you here.
---
that's a smol pp move!
---
JESUS. This problem has to be one of the most annoying bugs i have encountered in this game.
---
sock heaven?
---
thx
---
 I believe this was intended. As you fast travel to the event, the loading screen tells you that the hoard will grow unto you kill the alpha.
---
same issue here
---
I give it a 7.5 because this is still TECHNICALLY a multiplayer online fallout game, so that means end game needs to have some sort of longevity. I've heard the end game doesn't have that, you're grinding for gear that youdon't really need for anything because a level 25 can pop a level 70 player in the skull a few times and kill them. 
---
The leveling in most games I play is pretty enjoyable, so I don't judge a game mostly on that.
---
Unless they changed something recently it benefited from both in fo4 and in 76
---
From what I have seen yes. I personally don't have any friends in game to test but from what I've experienced and from what I have gathered from reddit post it seems to be the case.
---
It was nice having horde events all to myself while it lasted.
---
I finished it but if you need it too you can add me
---
Awe, but does the hoard spawn any legendaries??
---
You‚Äôre welcome. Same to you.
---
It worked for me. Got the atoms. I took everything Goff, even my backpack.
---
Do you know where I can get one?
---
Yeah, it'll keep being an issue until they start permanently banning dupers systems, so they don't just make new accounts to keep cheating.
---
Yeah same. I have no idea why people are down voting this so hard. I really don't think they are thinking about the immersion implications at all.
---
First of all, [that's already a thing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/540231134282252308/581195402888347726/unknown.png). It's the little red gun and body armor/shield looking icons on the bottom right of your screen. 
---
Secondly, you can also check your item condition bar by opening your quick select and hovering over the item.
---
I have to put it in by pressing the interact button while looking at the pipe that comes out the side.
---
Damn. I really hope Bethesda fixes this issue soon. I really hate this bug, because it's so annoying.
---
Aw, come on, I think I only said "literally" 3 times or so throughout the story lol.
---
Perfect. XD
---
They gotta fix this at somepoint right?
---
damage bug is a huge issue.  Often times you need to expend many times the amount of ammo to kill off an enemy thanks to the instant regen.
---
Here comes the laser nerf.  Like someone said. There's always a meta. Just wait two weeks it will change.
---
Lucky break level 3. It activates fairly often and will keep your laser gun usable for about 20-40% longer as well as your other weapons
---
If they were actually playing the multiplayer game they wouldn't need the server to intrusively request that people come save their solo butt.
---
I don't even use speed demon but notice this happening on a regular basis. And slithering bois are the worst
---
What's your current level?
---
Have you spent few hundred hours researching meta in this game?
---
I suppose I was misinformed then, that's a bummer.
---
I‚Äôm on PC. I‚Äôm not as fancy of a builder but it‚Äôs home. Open to guests except the upstairs because that is where my fusion generator is and there isn‚Äôt anything on that level that other people need to use.
---
Nah, I'm not mad, bro.  I'm just confused as to why, if you hate the game and developer so much, you spend so much time on the forum posting about it.  As for the bugs and glitches, sure there's still some in the game...but nothing I would consider game breaking.  The fact is, I enjoyed 76 when it was released despite the bugs and glitches (again, I never personally experienced anything gamebreaking) and I enjoy it even more now.  However, to say that there hasn't been much improvement since beta is an opinion that is in no way based on fact.
---
From what I've seen I don't think the loot all that great anyway.
---
Well honestly, I wouldn't wear a luck piece for more crit because i normally run 9 luck or more. The condition if items is niche at best. So it over limits it's usefulness without the ability to crit randomly from overdrive. In short, they made it where I personally can't use a luck piece. I do appreciate the correction on overdrive though, I want personally using it and had only heard of it.
---
I got two so far Horizon was one of them I forgot the other
---
Exactly!
---
Slap a paint job on them and they won't show up.
---
I ruined Campfire Tales the other day by picking up the Pet Rock too quickly.  It's unfortunate that these types of bugs continue to persist.
---
Thanks for the heads up. If I should make a purchase of a sizable proportion I'll be sure to contact the vendor first.
---
I wish we could build camps next to friends to set up impromptu garbage shanty towns
---
Yes it is annoying. Especially with all the rest involved.
---
Maybe instead of force flashing people's screens you can organize with other players before hand and get a group big enough to do it.
---
This event happens every half hour. 
---
Do you know what Chinese water torture is? 
---
Because this is going to be the drop of water for people who are trying to do anything else that doesn't involve this event.
---
A toggle is not an unreasonable request.
---
What if its like part of the upcoming dlc, explore the vault where we too all your shit from you. Remember when you feel off the cliff and couldn't get your stuff? Remember the tax we took from you? Bethesda remembers....Just 410 Atoms and you can unlock this "rare vault" lol
---
Not without a toggle to turn them off.
---
Just seen this. Thank you.
---
There are several factors at play in this game that make heavy weapons bad VATS weapons.
---
1) VATS builds shine with high AGI, which allows you to spam tonnes of shots. This is mostly achieved with unyielding armor which pumps you up to 30 AGI, you can't get this in PA which leads to point two
---
2) Heavies have awful recoil and less damage without the stabilised perk. While recoil won't affects VATS, you still lose damage from the lack of AP..
---
3) Automatic rifles are a popular VATS weapon because Bethesda rightly or wrongly decided if you put an auto receiver on a semi auto rifle, it cuts the AP cost in half, meaning many more shots. This affects VATS weapons because they are nearly all auto by default (which means they can't be modded for less AP usage). They use a rediculously amount of AP.
---
I can get like 50 rounds off in VATS with my handmade on my unyielding character with an auto handmade. I can get literally 3-5 shots off with my heavy weapons in VATS on my power armor heavy character, with the 50 cal, Gatling Laser, LMG etc.
---
Conclusion: I feel like heavies are intentionally designed to only be viable with manual aim. Don't confuse with with lack of power, they hit harder and have much larger Clip sizes than other weapons, lack of VATS is a drawback for having such power.
---
By all means, if you can make it work let me know. I haven't really tried a heavy build without PA, I suspect you could still get only like 10 shots off though, which is a joke with 75-1000 clip sizes.
---
Or people dont open their fkin map every 3 mins to check on the event ?
---
I lock a single purifier (If I even remember) but the rest I leave open.  No reason to be a greedy b@stard.
---
Appreciated!
---
Also, almost half of my melee hits land on the enemy, make the noise of damage but no damage is made at all. Super mutants even complaint of their chest or head being hurt but no damage. It happens even two or three time consecutive in the same enemy. It is a shame and have been occurring for some time.
---
Ive only purchased from the purveyor about 7 times.
---
My top 3:
---
TSE Lever with less vats
---
Bloodied Flamer with limb damage
---
TSE revolver.
---
I always drop the ones from my part runs on the watoga high school roof. Keeps them out of the way so they can respawn. I figure most people who want a chassis already have them.
---
I know this to be false.  My buddy works at Bethesda, on the game itself, and I've played with him on Xbox.
---
Yeah, I'm very happy with my basic 1* Bloodied Gatling Gun.  But I don't burn through ammo with it anymore since the SBQ isn't coming up very often now, so I've got like 4K rounds just sitting around.
---
This.  I can one shot mole miners with my Bloodied build, but scale back to give others a chance to tag. It still occasionally happens by accident when I don't realize what weapon I'm using, but I tone down ASAP when it comes up.
---
Yes, and the ammo is relatively cheap to make imo.  You get 54 Ultracite rounds each time you make it.
---
Nope... not as such :)
---
YES OMG PEOPLE COME OVER WHEN IM GRINDING AND KILL THE BOSS AHHHHH
---
Ap mag I guess, but the slow fire rate and reload will always have it inferior to the lever.
---
I'll try that next time! Thanks. The first 2 times I can usually put it in from the front.
---
Solo launch a nuke and kill SBQ with a rolling pin while naked in a nuke zone. -10 atom
---
Rifles and tormenter, I run a aa limb damage handmade with that perk. Shoot legs often and they keep tripping
---
Yeah My handmade weighing 22 is ridiculous.
---
Feels like half the time it doesn't work, no visible rhyme or reason to it.  Sad as I otherwise quite like that effect.
---
I'm going to have to raise the price on mine. I get so many of them, I thought they were worthless to others.
---
The mob level jump is crazy and is in no way linear. Level and scavenge and keep trying. I stopped mid 30s and came back mid 60s.
---
And I don't think it would count. Since they classify it as a cryptid.
---
Maybe instead of a notification you people should be asking for a looking for group tool.
---
Hunters hunted is objective evidence that even with a server wide announcement on everyone's screen you won't get enough people showing up.
---
What you really need is a looking for group tool, or you know, a guild/clan to run with.
---
But you absolutely should not force everyone to have to deal with annoying screen spam because you want loot.
---
are there any paints for weapons and armor that are available to get in game,and not through the ATOM store? 
---
if not, its good that is a technique but as it requires ATOM store purchases its not for everyone
---
thank you for the suggestion though!
---
You're likely just entering areas that higher level players have recently been. Enemies spawn related to player level, to a degree.
---
If it's not protected indoors, it's fair game.
---
As opposed to getting them for free?
---
&gt; Level 50 Fixer
---
how much do you charge?
---
Hey, I don't want things nerfed into oblivion like before, I love my BE laser rifle, but when I can melt the lv 100 boss in project paradise, within 30 seconds, and like only two other people tickling it, then there's a definite power difference
---
Create another character u can have up to 125k caps
---
Everyone seems to want the best of everything but that would be a boring game. It‚Äôs fun to have different levels and different equipment, it makes a rich experience.
---
Now if I could just find someone to take me on a silo run for my first time...
---
Level 170 and seen twice.
---
The event happens every thirty minutes. How hard is it to check the time?
---
I got dashboarded when it happened to me.
---
If they at least made it so items would not be able to be sold if it puts you over max caps, I'd be happy.
---
There is no balance and there never will be. You either have the proper perks in place for pvp with a pvp weapon, or you‚Äôre cannon fodder. They won‚Äôt and can‚Äôt fix it.
---
I've seen Responder corpses that you can loot all over the place lately.  I used to see them once in a blue moon.
---
Weapon Artisan. Repairs weapons above 100% increasing time for use.
---
Yeah the only thing u can do really is equip WWR armor
---
You are not alone. I feel exactly the same way of being an idiot for loving this game and be playing only it since launch. I did not touch my race simulator with all my equipment nor my racing games since its launch. It is very disappointing to be treated like that by Bethesda.
---
You then have never used an explosive laser rifle, with beam splitter and automatic barrel. The necessary perks and my BE laser out damages my BE handmade
---
How hard is it to ignore a 5second corner screen notification ? Can you not see the irony here?
---
It is really a shame that a fallout game has artificially limited capitalism so poorly
---
XB1, lvl 67: You're welcome, and welcome back!  I have been playing since the BETA start and continue to enjoy it thoroughly.  I have had some run-ins (I intend to post about predatory decontamination shower placement), but by far most of the encounters are positive.  I have picked up a couple of in game friends who I continue to enjoy playing with.
---
Why you need so many caps?
---
Initiate doesn't drop anymore, you're right. Now people just get Knight first, and they do go in order (but Knight CPT and Knight SGT are backwards)
---
Put your camp by a lead extractor. Not on it, but near one. The heavy gunner will be along shortly
---
The return of raider gangs would be nice :)
---
Oooohhhhh.. time to break out my explosive laser rifle from my STASH :)
---
Enclave bots compliment your outfit when wearing their under armor as well.
---
Do you recall what color flux is required offhand?
---
Yes it is, but maybe you need to lower it to 5k or change servers.
---
But bloodied explosive is what really sells this days.
---
I just try to keep the junk I need in a reasonable amount, I still collect everything, but if it's not tagged then I'll sell it. Same with junk that I dont think I'm using fast enough.  But dont worry, im a hoarder too (I currently have 54 full chassis of power armor, so stash is a huge thing for me), once you get the hang of what's needed and what isn't you'll be able to hoard all the things you want
---
They have totally screwed teamwork and party roles by forcing a contest to tag enemies for rewards.
---
People in your party should get xp and loot period for being in the vicinity to encourage teamwork
---
Just shoot the thing once and you will get the loot, but I agree with this
---
Yup, you cant just blast through the story alone.....
---
At a few points you will need to level up in older areas and buy/find/craft better stuff
---
&gt;That or theres a group that modded in the paint from fallout 4 and they made a very limited amount of them that are still floating around
---
Correct me if I'm wrong...but that's not at all how that works.
---
That's why I wait for the prompt. It's a 20+ minute event. No need to rush.
---
lol I know :P They were just rapid-fire is all, so I had to razz you a little ;)
---
In NV a lil text prompt would appear for a few seconds telling you what armour was low durability, which having only 2 armour slots made little sense but with 5 in 76 that would be a very nice QOL improvement IMO
---
I think the leaks are pointing to a battle Royale type mode
---
If you "stole" from me, you are welcome. All my food is shared with everybody else. When I need, I always can craft enough food for myself.
---
That's just what I found from looking
---
I‚Äôve never seen additional legendaries for stretching out the horde. 
---
You can stretch One Violent Night to get more legendaries before the wendigo shows up
---
Same, collected all the lost camper items but mission got stuck on it. Tried FTing out of there hoping it would allow it to continue for the others that showed to keep going, but my game then crashed so not sure how the rest made out.
---
Since it's now at 108, I can upvote it! :D
---
Aaaand... done!
---
Thanks. Hate to feel like I ripped someone off.
---
No usually, but maybe you want 1000 gulper innards?
---
And add deep pockets to all all 5 pieces of course.
---
Is the original post an actual challenge??? I‚Äôm definitely screwed, I have like 7-800 hours and I‚Äôve NEVER even seen the Flatwoods alien
---
Has to with the camera make sure something is on sight and done
---
shoot then picture. 
---
dead rabbits count as photos, live rabbits dont count as kills.
---
Yep. People who nuke WS should do the same before investing all the time in the silos.
---
Do you know how much it is on the trading subs? I‚Äôm interested in it, but I‚Äôm tired of hunting down specific camps with rare stuff. I‚Äôm thinking of buying it via Reddit.
---
I figured this out with an Angler Horde in the Mire. The Boss was stuck in an outpost outside of the power plant. The enemies were spawning inside of it every time I killed them and I got 4 legendaries to spawn. Unfortunately my Melee weapon broke and the only thing else I had on me was a TSE Tesla Shotgun and I killed them all due to AOE damage
---
I've had a few events complete about 10 seconds after fast traveling, but it was because the boss was killed by another NPC. 
---
Also, sometimes you get to the area, the quest updates, and then you have to search a few remote areas across the region before you "find the source". I used to think it was bugged before I figured it out.
---
Used to take me 1 day of playing to get 5 levels, after 200 it‚Äôs like a week üòÖ
---
Its not specific enough IMO, i would like to know precisely which piece is breaking so i don‚Äôt have to slog through my crowded apparel tab because i gather lots of cosmetics. In new vegas it would just have a little text prompt in the corner saying something was close to breaking.
---
I also compulsively repair things at about 50% as it takes less resources the higher condition its in.
---
They ensured this result the day they decided to use the perk and legendary system the way they are currently in the game.
---
Bethesda cannot fix this without changing both of these systems completely. The game is flawed at its core by these systems and it is really a shame because they cheapen an otherwise beautiful gem of a game.
---
Same amount of hours and I still haven‚Äôt seen him
---
Oh, that ol' Hag? I've given her 300 script so far and I didn't even get a t-shirt.
---
Serums, prime plans and radshield. Although I only sell serums, prime plans and radshield so there is that.
---
Same with SBQ unless they fixed it
---
Gatling plasma
---
So any word?
---
It's most likely one of the ultracite laser weapons
---
I recently went back to shotguns after goofing off with rifles for a while. Sure I'm not 1 shotting everything, but my crowd control is insane. Damage is still great too, though that's more on my double barrel shotguns having stuff like anti armor or E/Executioners. 
---
The new event is perfect for shotguns. One spray into a pack and they're all crippled. Focus fire the level 100 limbs and the boss is unmoving for the rest of the fight.
---
Just because it's not 1 shot easy doesnt mean it's not still amazing.
---
What do you play on? I have some extra pieces if you don‚Äôt care what kind it is
---
I use it to pull or when i dont wanna dash into the middle of a shit fest i will pop the leader and then molotov the party and get my bloddied melee on
---
Its cheaper to repair the mor durability it has, i generally repair weapons at about 50% but as mentioned its more cluttered to go through an inventory full of items to see whats breaking than a tiny text prompt at the top of the screen like in 3 and NV
---
I've done about 5 in the past week before giving up. None of them gave me any quest at all when I went there, so I assumed it was broken and gave up.
---
Welp his portrait is in the game so he gets the blame
---
Amongst the worst challenges of this week
---
That is the sad part. We are supposed to be interacting with each other and making the wasteland ours, but the hunt for RNGesus just keeps people laser focused on the next 3 star drop.
---
I mean they murdered the hell out of crafting by making the endgame focus so much on legendaries
---
Depends.
---
Paint you learned from a Plan such as Brother Hood of Steel or Nuka Cola?   YES
---
Paint you bought from the ATOM Store such as Camouflage?   NO
---
The selling system isn't done right, IMO. They should have to label what they are selling by type. You should be able to search from the Social menu for what 'type' you are looking for and go from there.  
---
Maybe a central hub where you gain access to a computer. You can see a vendor along with what they are selling. From there that vendor can be marked on your map and then it's your decision.  
---
You should see what they are selling as to make your decision and they have to list accordingly.  
---
IMO, that's common sense. Jumping around just to find something good is a waste of time, BGS.  
---
So what if i'm not playing? Marketing researchers can do all sorts of things without buying into that market.
---
Plans that I put for dirt cheap just to get rid of them, magaizes, power armor pieces. in that order
---
Definitely sell ‚≠êÔ∏è legendaries.  Sell em for dirt cheap!  Sell em no matter the level!  I will buy them all! üß¢
---
That makes no sense and in no way is a form of argument.  
---
They have the freedom to sell crap and you have the freedom to not buy stuff. From what I've seen having to travel there just to see, was a bad choice. It should be fixed.
---
Sorry I can't see the irony because there is an annoying pop up that is covering it up. Ask me again in a few seconds when it is gone.
---
Right now the staff with mods is between 200-450 caps (dependent on the mod with burning barbed being the most). Clubs are about 150-350 caps. And crooks I cont care to just give away, no one has ever wanted one before LoL
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 if you‚Äôre interested in any, I‚Äôve grounded the event for two weeks straight to get every single mod available for each weapon
---
The implication is if he‚Äôs a not a low level he should know better.
---
I don't even blame my friends for quitting this game anymore. Every major event we did has had a big at some point. Currently experiencing this issue myself.
---
From what I know, you can mod existing *local* files to change or replace the look of objects in the game, but those changes will never reflect on anyone else's screen.  You're not actually modifying a game asset, just the 'skin' you see locally.  
---
There is no way to get the changes you make with a mod to upload to the servers so that other people can see them.
---
I'm 100% certain this is the case, but if someone has other information that I've never heard about, I'd be very interested in hearing about it.
---
I'm in the U.S and judging by the comments it's prob worldwide
---
Your faith in bethesda is troubling üòÜ
---
It is becoming a little problematic, especially when combined with the limitations of camp budget and storage space.
---
I'm Level 195 now.  Even when fast traveling everywhere, I stay near 25k caps.  I have all the supplies I need, so I don't need to spend caps.  I could collect a wider range of armor and weapons, but where would I store them?  The stash space is limited.  I could use it to buy materials to build up my camp, but I'd hit max camp budget way before running out of caps.  I could buy ammo, but I don't go through it fast enough to keep the caps down.
---
I want to bring those caps down so I can sell good stuff at my camp.  But on *what*?  I know nearly every plan and recipe in the game.  The ones I don't know are almost entirely the ones I'd never use (such as mods to a specific kind of power armor, which I don't have the stash space to justify keeping that set in addition to my favored kinds).
---
I still have things to do (such as get my backpack), but I feel a bit of a lack of upward mobility here.  Too much money, no way to store all the good stuff that I'd buy with it.
---
I just hit level 50, so it's relatively fresh in my mind. I personally quested until about 20, then just roamed around leveling up ( make sure to be well rested +5% xp) until i got to 30-35 and started questing again and doing whitesprings runs. If you get a fully modded raider armor, depending on your build of course, you can pretty much solo white springs as of 30.
---
What about now?
---
Ultracite laser rifle with a beam splitter, or maybe a two-shot ultracite gatling laser
---
Yea I agree. With such a huge in game economy, putting limits on Caps turns the game into Accountant Simulator 2019.
---
Again, that's just what I found in the like 3 search results about it
---
This might sound like a silly question, but have you provided power to the vending machine? Also, are you in a reasonably central location on the map?
---
It's possible you bought something just as he was leaving server? Bad bug if that's the case.
---
I use the drill and wood armor for my termite build.
---
It‚Äôs almost better to have a bugged challenge, at least that can be fixed to actually complete üòÇ
---
I saw two Brahmin from free range take out a glowing yao gui that I hadn't tagged at all...how tough are those cows
---
If it was a rifle or pistol, it was probably the Ultracite Laser Gun with a splitter barrel.
---
If it was a Heavy Weapon, it was probably a Gatling Plasma with a splitter.
---
Then its probably too low
---
And for goodness sake, do not drop the parts with Atom shop paintjobs. They will be destroyed.
---
Almost every single time I do Pharma me and my buddy will complete a room to level 3 then all the others rooms will still be level 0 with all the people inside just standing around shooting the mobs. They get to be greedy and steal all those mobs and get boss loot for doing jack shit?
---
This was fixed a while back, but it looks like the bug is introduced again. I heard a woman complaining that she couldn't loot the alpha sheepsquatch during the arktos event yesterday even though I saw her doing large amounts of damage to it. The third person there turned it into an ash pile, so it's probably the same bug
---
I bought a 3 star super sledge last night for 2.5k caps. Then someone bought 2k ammo from me and I went back up to 20k caps. Then later someone bought another 2k caps from me but when I checked my inventory I didnt have 22k caps.
---
Nah I wanna sell it....T51 I do not use.
---
Yeah, definitely marking them up. They can be found at vendors super close to my store, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many people don‚Äôt know that. I regularly sell the arms and legs for about 500 each and the chest for 750-1000 caps. It‚Äôs shitty, I know...
---
I keep my hopes high and my expectations low
---
PS4 and is looking for unyielding specifically
---
Wood armor is only supposed to spawn in as 1 star though!
---
I just find this price to be crazy. But well.. if they sell /shrug. Do people not know they can get 12 free cores every \~20 minutes by taking the 3 power plants? That's 36 cores, or 3600 caps per hour...
---
I took the power plants for a full day and farmed them for 12 hours a few months ago. Still riding on the 300+ cores I got that day.
---
And that paint job wont work on excavator PA which is my build....
---
I agree, did it all on one char.. never ever again imo
---
There is no combination of perks that can save you from 70% of the weapons PvP players are using right now
---
I have a ultracite gatling laser if your interested?
---
Its just a game yall. When i hit max cap i just sell everything for 1cap to help out others. Or i just go around and buy stuff i dont really need off other player vendors, share the love around. When you quit the game eventually the caps just going to sit there anyways so use them and stop trying to be a hoarder.
---
How is the drill nowadays? I remember it could deal some pretty good damage back in the days of the over-repair bug, but haven't seen any mention of it since that was fixed
---
I dont think those people exist? It's always the same where one person does everything while everyone else is a clueless chicken with their head cut off.
---
Thanks Brother.....
---
 As you cannot benefit from 200% over repair any more, V Fast weapons are useless.
---
There‚Äôs one today that involves doing path to enlighten naked it‚Äôs broken btw hahaha
---
Good to hear it worked out for you. I‚Äòll keep my eyes open
---
If you liked the Tadpole challenges, just wait until you get you hands on the Possum challenges!
---
Ah okay XB1 for me and yeah unyielding is what I use and never found extras haha
---
I've been trying to keep just around 50 of each and I don't worry about wood or steel as they are the easiest to get.  I always keep all my screws as they seem to be what I have the hardest time getting.
---
Probably random junk like screws, acid, lead, steel, 
---
Sold quite a few jetpacks for 499 the other day.
---
Wait, what!?!  People buy power armor pieces?  At least tell me they have awesome upgrades, or my faith in humanity sinks further.
---
I sell increased durability weapons and armor daily. Lv20-40 range seem to sell best. I also sell chems and ammo like crazy. Ammo is 1-5 caps and chems are 15-60.
---
Exactly
---
Honestly 20+ lbs for a gun is just ridiculous. Idk how heavy a drum mag is but my handmade with a drum mag is 22.8 lbs. I'd like to put a drum mag on a real ak and weigh it out
---
I've done the first 3 and am stuck on the final badges challenge... I have no motivation to finish it.
---
This is with most games. Especially [at the moment] Anthem
---
The problem is there are individual items in the game that can cost close to the cap. I remember selling a 3* bloodied handmade for 13k and lost a few thousand of that because I wasn't expecting it to sell. You can't have incentives to carry around a large amount of cash on you with no way of safely storing it and then also have restrictions for carrying said large amount of cash
---
Yeah I've already accepted that I will literally never even consider doing them lmao
---
2 points of Fireproof and a dense chest is enough to mitigate 99% of the damage from explosive weapons. I can fire my explosive shotty point blank at something and it takes *maybe* 1 hp off of me.
---
I always try to sell cheap; like 50% of recommended price at most.  But yeah: plans, bobbleheads, magazines.  Been finding there's a market for aid items; chems, alcohol, food.  Just keep it cheaper than the vendor bots and it's surprisingly kinda helpful.
---
All events. Mark it in your personal terminal and get alerted when it pops up. I've been wanting to do the camp fire one but every time I FT there I get swarm of suitors.
---
I understand, just enlightening you about how things actually work with mods, at least with my somewhat limited understanding of them.
---
I, unfortunately, kinda have to agree with him.
---
I love the game. I have over 700 hours into it through two characters, level 79 which I play only on with a friend, and level 153 alt that I play solo but generally avoid quests on. My play style on my solo char is very much wander, explore, grind for plans/legendaries, and now attend my store as well as visit other's. I also get a lot of satisfaction out of giving stuff to people, be it legendaries to lowbies, valuable junk (screws, springs, gears, etc), or plans. 
---
However, Bethesda launched 76 too early I think, as I feel after the Vaults open, then the game will have been roughly where a solid MMO would launch. By then it'll have adequate things to grind, like dungeons, and hopefully enough variation in loot to merit doing so. At launch, the more exciting thing would've been SBQ... which in itself takes a fair bit of time to even get a nuke launched. In between that point in time, all manner of shit can happen to throw a wrench into it:You get disconnected and can't rejoin that server to finish the launch,;the server crashes in the middle of it and you've lost all that progress anyways; there are no longer enough high-level players to help tackle the SBQ in the aloted time; she glitches and fucks-off to wherever she goes, never to return; or once again you disconnect just as she dies, which means once you return you've screwed out of the loot since you don't register as capable of looting her (has happened to me).
---
Sorry you feel that way. Shoot. I thought the tadpole and possum quests were some of the best fun I've had in this game in a long time. The obstacle courses for athletics were great. For the revive, someone just walked up and asked, and we did the in-water one for swimming. As for crossbows, they have fixed spawns. They're not that random or hard to find. Good luck.
---
Frigging Hercules had less tasks to do
---
I'm glad it's not worth more than 10 atoms because there's approximately a 0% chance of completing it.  At least I'm only missing out on the minimum amount
---
The biggest low point in the game is about 25-50 ... you don‚Äôt have solid legendary gear that matches your build, you don‚Äôt have the QOL crafting perks, mobs are outpacing you and being spawned by much higher level.
---
As soon as you het 45-50, as soon as you get a decent PVE legendary (even one star) that matches your build (an instigating hunting rifle or 2H melee is HUGE for resource saving) things get better. Get those perks to reduce repair costs, get those super-duper, etc. 
---
Things get better. 60-75 ish is really when you exit the turn. You‚Äôre just in a dark period.
---
Thanks man!
---
Nah, he went upstairs, then after the purchase went back down, looked at me, and then logged off.
---
Not at all. It's called retail arbitrage. They aren't just buying a plan, they are buying your time to acquire the plan from the vendor, and your knowledge of what vendor has the plan. If it was a crappy thing to do, then so would be me selling bloatfly glands for 50c. They didn't cost me anything at all. But I spent time and ammo to get them so I sell them to those that need bug guts for insect repellent.
---
The natural progression path is the forest, toxic valley/ash heap, savage divide, mire/cranberry bog. The toxic valley and ash heap can very rarely have enemies that go up to level 40, but anything from the savage divide onwards can spawn level 60+ enemies consistently based on the levels of players passing through. And the savage divide just happens to have some of the most frequented locations in the game, so many of them will pretty much always have enemies that are too high of a level for you
---
The cap is perfectly fine. The lack of money sinks is the issue.
---
Thanks! Are they any good for Bloodied builds (damage-wise) ?
---
Yes how?
---
Usually around 250-350 caps
---
Comically weak.  You need to have great puns ready for it to be of any use.
---
Got a source for that? First I‚Äôve heard anything like it.
---
I agree that the challenges are a little time consuming but those 3 tadpole challenges for the backpack are not that hard, i suggest doing archer, swimmer and athlete.
---
But i do not recommend doing those possum challenges cause atleast for me they just get frustrating and tedious
---
I disagree. The odds of getting a decent 3rd star that actually complements the other weapon (and other effects) are so slim that you're better off rolling twice as many 2 star weapons until you get the combo you want. Once you get your personal god roll 2 star, then start rolling 3s, but until then it's a waste of scrip IMO.
---
I do the same, at first it was 2 caps per unit of charge but now it's just 1. It's not silly IMO - a fuller core should cost more.
---
There are lots of rabbits and squirrels in the city where the Fauchnacht (sp?) Parade was.
---
I sell them default for like 25 caps. It makes me about the same as selling to vendors, but saves them the time of having to look for a specific part. I'm next to watoga for that reason. Parts from crafted only sets(ie. Excavator) I sell for about 200 at 200%. Sometimes I'll throw on a jet pack and sell them for 1000. It's a decent market but not enough to keep my stash open
---
Did the amount of caps you have go up?
---
I wont be suprised if this happens
---
Don't want to play Devil's Advocate but from my experience (on PC) survival is exactly like how people like OP explain it. Either camping stations or farming XP on low-level characters. Fine, don't change adventure, but please make survival better.. or nuclear winter.
---
Quad is fantastic on gauss as a general use weapon. I have a Quad / FFR that is fantastic. Generally you‚Äôre one-shooting things in the head, and the extra clip size really is a convenience item.
---
My weapons have weights of .90 and ~3.
---
Buncha rabbits at the whitesprings bunker and sometimes at the lumbermill near vault 76
---
"I see a suit of armor around the world"
---
Wait sorry, someone just started encrypted, still can't read it.
---
All energy weapons underperform due to the lack of armor piercing for energy resistance. You can still make them work if you min-max, but they will always be worse than a similar ballistic  weapon until they fix AP for energy resistance.
---
I can assure you that an AK with a drum mag wouldn‚Äôt weigh 22.8 lbs irl. A normal AK-47 (not AKM or any other variant) weighs 6.8 pounds. A fully loaded 30 round mag adds about a pound to that, if the drum mag holds 75 rounds we can just round that up to 2 and a half pounds.
---
Basically your AK should only weigh at most 9-10 pounds
---
It's not even a quest...just tedious challenges but the backpack is nice.
---
trying to get one. no luck as of yet
---
I can‚Äôt find any mods for Enclave Scout Armor. Would‚Äôve applied deep pockets if I could‚Äôve
---
Tested by myself. Poisoned Club, Staff, Shard and probably machete with ritual mod are reducing physical armor of targets that are not immune to the poison. Just remove all perks for armor ingore, check armor of the creature, throw shard or hit it with club and check again. You'll see it has 3 armor less. Probably i'm the first who noticed this. I made a post here but it didn't get enough attention
---
It's really only worthwhile if you upgrade to a deathclaw and can handicap the end boss quickly enough. 
---
I'm the guy that stays glued to the most capable creature from start to finish. If they just run around and hide, that means I'm clearing random small enemies instead of getting my shots in on the end boss. 
---
Had an event last night where I was the ONLY one defending our deathclaw. It would've died had I not followed it across 2 habitats. Turns out my 2-3 shots on the sheepsquatch weren't adequate for loot credit though. So there I was, the sole reason we didnt fail the event, with nothing but some useless ammo and a pulse grenade as a reward.
---
It's an odd trade off. Mayve once they fiz the other 2 habitats to where they even have a chance at getting full troughs itll be different.
---
Gotcha, thanks, fingers crossed it gets rectified, my BE Tesla is showing the same damage as a normal Bloodied Tesla too, strange!
---
Bethesda quality. They are probably using some summer trainees to do translations. Why? Its cheap.
---
Fair enough. I've never actually used heavy weapons and didn't know they suffered a lot in VATS, but from what you've said it makes a lot of sense.
---
I just tested the broadsider with a concentrated fire rank 1 card and no other perks. It didn't seem to suffer in accuracy whatsoever even without stabilized but you were definitely right about the AP usage. One shot ate about 60 or 70 AP so even if I used unyielding that'd probably only be about 4 or 5 shots.
---
Not really worth it imo, especially since the broadsider has a pretty nice fire rate and I could also put my extra points into melee as a back up.
---
Thank you for the detailed response it was really helpful!
---
Camp fire is south in the Forest at Camp Adams at night, swarm of suitors is up north in the Toxic Valley by the Grafton Dam!
---
Thank you, 50+ I‚Äôm all behind. Not interesting in carrying 10 level 20 and below players. It is very common on Xbox to see low level players, not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that. It‚Äôs just that when you send out server wide notification they all come running and are able to contribute nothing.
---
&gt;and make major changes to the main questline with Wastelanders 
---
This makes it sound like Wastelanders is actually just a redux of the already existing main questline, as opposed to its own new story
---
im just curious about the prewar tadpoles.. i mean really decrypt and launch a nuke.. those mf'rs hardcore enough to make boy scouts look like day care.
---
No. He‚Äôs right.   What‚Äôs next?  Quad Fast Fire Teslas?   Bloodied Explosive Railway Rifles with automatic pistons?   Quad explosive automatic radium rifles?   Executioner FFR Handmades?    Vampire Explosive .50s?   Junkies builds?   What‚Äôs hot evolves.  But someone is always unhappy about it.   Again, as Maxima proposed below, let‚Äôs have separate legendary effects between Survival and Adventure.   That way PVE can remain unaffected by the arms race and subsequent cries for ‚Äúbalance.‚Äù
---
Did you still see the event icon on your map? If so, that's been an issue with event quests for a while. The event is taking place, but the quest doesn't register for you. I had it happen when Fasnacht Day came out, and it again with Scorched Earth just a couple of nights ago. When it happens, you can click the event icon and "Join event" again.
---
Yeah, but how?
---
20 = 1
---
40 = 2
---
60 = 3
---
You need at least 3 people to have a chance of all at 60.  Even then, collecting 60 pieces seem to be quite hard.  I think you probably need 6 people to have the best chance.
---
Thats because of a card or legendary armor/weapon effect? ok.
---
I'm SOOOO glad to hear this.. :)
---
Is he a PVP'er?
---
But you have to admit some of the bugs make you think that this is not happening.
---
They should have up to 5 events you can flag to send you a notification. Like P.P, U.F, AWOL, or whatever else. Then when you have a daily quest to do a certain event you don‚Äôt have to keep hopping or checking the map
---
Only paints I know of require atoms. Sorry.
---
For 1200 atoms, you can buy a skin to make your drill look like a flare gun.
---
There should never have been "legacy" weapons in the game in the first place. In order to make any PVP system work properly, all players should have access to the same weapons (at least the same loot pool possibilities). They should have all been changed to have a different effect, or entirely removed. Most of them are still around from the duping days anyway, and weren't found honestly. They should have removed all the duped weapons as well, not just let all the dupers keep one copy of their cheat-created god guns. It severely broke PVP. You have a few cheaters with ultimate gear just farming everyone else for caps. The "Survival" servers are practically dead. The final straw was when all the cheaters with their duped or bought ultimate gear whined about being one-shot with crits: "Oh, it's just not FAIR! Even with my massive advantages, sometimes I get over-confident and end up sniped in the head and DIE! Waaaaahhhh! It's not FAIIIRRRR! Bethesda, make them stooopppp!". So now the average Joe had no hope of ever being able to kill these gear-whores with their Asshole/Sentinel full sets and broken BE shotguns (at least THOSE finally got bugfixed). At which point the few people who were keeping the OP players in check with careful stealth gameplay just quit wasting their time and caps now that these players were functionally un-killable.   
---
The lesson: PVP never works if a few select individuals have a massive advantage.
---
Melee weapons base stats don't really matter that much when they all one hit kill most enemies.
---
What outfit are you wearing? Could be one that doesn‚Äôt support a backpack
---
Ah... Yes, you are so correct the possibility of that most awesome item unrealized.
---
Lmao
---
They don‚Äôt
---
Lvl 50 fixer. Yep. I paid 1k. Sadly
---
wasn't so bad for me just took a while. Did it all solo without asking anyone to kill themselves for me. I just did the encryptid event once and got the revive almost right away.
---
Yep, everybody needs to eat or complete a challenge.
---
Maps and serums. Occasionally plans. Some of my nicer weapons do sell (AAE, etc.) but it‚Äôs funny that only the TOP tier ones sell and the 2nd tiers just aren‚Äôt. What you used to maybe really like (I have an Executioner / Limb damage LMG .. minigun ... etc. ... they just sit)
---
Hunters long coat
---
Omg i got hosed
---
With adrenal reaction, twisted muscles, nerd rage, radicool, 3 points in slugger (1 rank of each card), bloody mess, and 4 pieces of unyielding gear, my bloodied baseball bat does somewhere in the range of 1,200 dmg per hit once I drop below 20%hp. I could stack more slugegr perks and increase that another 30%, but it's already overkill since I can one shot pretty much every normal mob in the game, and things like mirelurk queens and hermit crabs go down in 2-3 swings.
---
The true king of hill with bloodied is the deathclaw gauntlet. With all of the appropriate perks and mutations you can get them up to 5k+ damage per swing.
---
We will see.
---
Don't be. I planted them for you and everyone else to take. :)
---
None of the above solutions worked :(
---
I think hunter/hunted is objective evidence that no one wanted pvp. Survival mode was a nice compromise.
---
I agree fully with a toggle tbh. We should all have a way to track all active quests we are interested in, in our pip boys.
---
I got a picture of a dead sentry bot looking sad. Its been my only picture that ive kept since like 3 months ago. It always gives me a good laugh when i see it.
---
I sell dozens of stimpaks a day at 15caps each
---
There's an ultracite gatling laser too.
---
Take a break from running the quest lines for a bit and just explore the left half of the map for awhile. Most experienced players will tell you the same i think. You'll know when your ready for the next step.
---
PREACH!!!!!!!!!
---
Better yet tho. All legendary loot needs to be shared for everyone in the event!
---
I think the challenges are good. It's a step in the right direction for Bethesda to implement tasks and challenges that can't be realistically completed in a day. The big aspect to a lot of fallout dropouts has been several lack of content. Well they designed their game too simplistic. New content added was able to be done within a day or two. These challenges actually make you work for your gear, which is new to this game. 
---
They can be aggravating if you're trying to grind every challenge in one sitting.
---
Fridges won't affect my gameplay at all because I have the option of eating the enemies I kill via Cannibal. I never have to carry around food and worry about it spoiling.  And if I'm collecting shit to make alcohol or healing items?  That's a specific task I'm on, so I don't go around exploring and jumping into events until after I'm done.  I have never once used or purchased a repair kit, partially because I don't want to sacrifice my repair to 200% ability that perks give me.  The items you mentioned are convenience, but they are in no way gamechanging additions that you'll be at a severe disadvantage if you don't have.
---
Nobody ever buys my fusion cores and I price them at 1 cap per unit of charge.
---
Buy gunpowder and make ammo, then sell ammo when you need caps
---
Your prices on ammo are absolutely mad, I wouldn‚Äôt buy anything for 2caps/round, let alone more.
---
yeah the lighthouse event. Bugged for me with Asylum clothes once, now this
---
When people say this game doesn't have lore in it
---
This happened to me - I realised my vendor wasn't powered!! üòë

Zing!
---
lumbernill near 76 is a great place to complete most critter challenges, there are at least 3 spots where random critters will spawn. Just world hop for a bit and it made my life a whole lot easier.
---
That would suck
---
At least for me
---
Am I misreading this, or did you just tell a BGS employee that you would like this feature because it will be helpful for exploiting nuke zone spawns?
---
Right! Ac odyssey, Rdr2, Anthem, division2 they just don‚Äôt keep me interested enough.
---
Not really so I have no clue I only noticed cause I was dying super quick.
---
I keep getting sent to cliffwatch
---
leave a full farm out for anyone that needs it along with 10 large purifiers, i know there are people out there having problems managing food, or short on water due to making stimpaks, i dont mind those people coming to find me or a random running across my farm going "oh thank god, this just made things easier on me." im glad to have helped make someone elses time in here a better experience.  
---
since i check map often (and stay on same server for hours on end) i noticed a guy was hittin my camp about every 30 min cleanin garden and water.. no clue if he was using or selling, didnt care, figured whatever it was doing was helping him in some way.. kept him fed and hydrated, or got him a few caps closer to the weapon hes wanting to buy, either way im cool with it.
---
Are Bloodied Gatlings any good? Im currently sitting on 3 max levels and dont know if theyre worth selling.
---
2/4 of these should take a novice programmer minutes to do correctly.
---
Workshop ownership is transferred to a teammate when you log out

Recipes for 20-30 each
---
These are all mostly nonexistent problems. Assassin sentinel, while powerful, is not an absolute meta, and you can surely be extremely efficient without it. I myself use absolute zero assassin/sentinel pieces and zero sentinel pieces on 2/3 of my PvP-ready characters. The dupe problem is imagined one as what it did it allowed much more people stock up on gear that suited their playstyle. Average Joe has a better life due to it. Its also dupers who even the odds for majority of the people without an Explosive Laser Rifle. I myself only got one on my own and I strongly suspect noone would sell three different ones I have if they werent duped at some point. The only unfair thing is that things which are meta should at all times be accessible (rare - ok, but accessible!) for all players without resorting to purchasing duped guns.
---
It's been a while since I played with one, but don't UGLs fire red lasers?
---
That's very kind of you. I'd definitely like to make more friends to play 76 with on PS4.
---
Crimson, imo one of the easier to acquire
---
They're out there. I purchased one for 50 caps from a random player's vending machine.
---
I had already finished this now repeatable event and I was helping my wife who had not. So apparently when it was "patched" they didn't force it to work in order. If you  get the scortchbeast DNA and put it into the machine you have to get the password from the 4th floor of Fort Defiance, which will then allow the password dialogue on the terminal next to the machine. Then you will be either prompted to switch the power or run the analysis. I noticed that I was able to use the terminal with password dialogue and my wife was not and it was exactly as you describe for her. Showed her in Fort Defiance where the password was and all worked after that.
---
I hope we get another 100 days roadmap, so that we can finally tell when Prestige/Legendary characters will launch
---
See so I was wrong it wasn't tactics he never officially joined the Bo's but you know
---
Fine 1 cap. Not one cap less than that.
---
yeah but that dude didn't need a backpack....
---
Hopefully a plague doctor outfit (maybe a hat too) is released also.
---
You have to add them as a friend and hope they accept
---
Okay, tough boy.
---
I lost a backpack just now upon stashing all junk..
---
I do indeed like skulls, my Xbox username is literally Skull King
---
If people open themselves up to pvp in adventure it's kind of on them. I dont play 76 for pvp so no one is going to get me into pvp
---
I really do not know much at all about programming, but it seems variations of most of these features are in the game.
---
Yes they should change it. Add a legendary label or something. But until then we should stop selling useless junk that's only there to rip off noobs. And people in marketing know what businesses are selling before they spend any money. So that argument isn't sound
---
Another person complaining that the always online multiplayer shared world game requires human interaction. Neat.
---
This is awesome and it replicates my experiences too. I'd say that 90% of my rng meets are always good. Of course I'm normally to dude handing out stuff.. Too bad there wasn't a Community partisanship rating that you carried to let others know your a great dude... or a "shit head" :P  No, I'm not asking for yet another feature add....
---
Really no need for roles...high dmg and you are fine üëç
---
Yes, I've had that happen too, I read post somewhere that if you wait for each item to have diamond over it before picking up it doesn't bug out. Ever since I have done it that way and not had the issue of it not progressing.
---
1) Bug, should be doable.  I *sometimes* automatically respawn at the SBQ fight (and frequently, if not always, at the ISS fight) as opposed to picking a location.  It's sporadic, but seems like there's some code in there that should make it possible.
---
2) CMs have commented they're looking at that
---
3) Would take a little re-coding, don't see why it wouldn't be possible.  I think 5 minutes is way too long, but somewhere in there would work.
---
4) Would take a major rework of the whole loot system.  Could be bypassed by having the boss drop no loot, and only rewards come from completing the event.  Not sure if 'random 1-3 star rewards' is a simple thing to add, but maybe.
---
All great ideas though, I'm on board.
---
Haha and all those pre recorded messages and guides are not that boyscout like.
---
Got about half way through, said who needs this tedious BS, and stopped worrying about it. Backpack isn't worth the hassle. Made it this far without it, guess I'll keep on not worrying about it.
---
I agree with the over-all statement, they REALLY need to up the cap limit. Honestly to 100K plus.   
---
However, in general, don't list shit you can't afford to have actually sell.
---
I'd rather have lead underwear to block the radiation and keep me fertile.
---
Just kind of stared the game.  I only take enough to get me a little longer. I always feel bad
---
This game is 90% lore
---
Even though they said that it would be completely playable on single player? Ok sure bud üëçüèº
---
Recent player list only works when disconnected from server. The list clears out when the game crashes
---
Dude
---
Your fine with offering bad advice to others but refuse to educate yourself about the very topic you want to ‚Äúteach‚Äù ?
---
I get that POV , but it‚Äôs just sadly ironic in this situation. 
---
If you won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt be bothered to see what harm your doing, then at the very least stop doing it.
---
After some testing I found that accuracy and damage wise it seems alright. The AP consumption however makes it incredibly undesirable. You can get about 1-5 shots off depending on how much agility you have and whether or not you're using unyielding armor.
---
+1 on Savage Divide. I'm near Top of the World and get good traffic. I'm very close (1-2 caps) to a train station, so that helps business I think.
---
Thank you. And thank you for all the ammo earlier.  My alts need leveling!
---
Happened to me like that, lol. Player came over to revive me and ate me instead. I laughed/was pissed at the same time because it's a hilariously dick move. But then he apologized profusely because he did intend to revive me, haha.
---
Nice! I completely forgot about the cryolater since the ammunition is so unreasonably hard to create (is that still the case?). I've seen them being used on the SBQ and it worked well there so this is a great idea.
---
This is why the prices on the market sub are dropping.  50 million script turned in means, on average, 500,000 3\* weapons and 500,000 3\* pieces of armor have entered the game that replaced millions of 1\* and 2\*'s (I know people are buying 2\* also but just as a example).
---
Well in fairness, it wasn't a nerf, it was a fix. Every other explosive in the game was reduced to 25% explosive damage but the shotty was missed.
---
Because a human NPC isn't reading it too them off a script.
---
Not that they wouldn't bypass the script if given half a chance.  And then *still* complain about the lack of lore.
---
Oh it's not easy nor guaranteed, and it's early in it's release so a lot of people still haven't RTFM, but I got lucky and my second attempt at the quest everyone was on their game.  Troughs filled up to minimum Tier 2 and one Tier 3, so it's possible.  All three survived an Alpha Grafton Monster and I got the Stimpack Diffuser reward.  I hear you can get it even with 2 experiments surviving, but I imagine only 1 you aren't going to get anything great.  
---
I did find in my experience last night that disabling the computer is NOT going to be a good option, the experiments invariably go after the Alpha and die.
---
you have 900 lbs of cores???
---
That's what the shit is there for. If it's accessible, and it's renewable, it's fair game.  Extractors and water purifiers are lockable for a reason, etc. If you don't want people taking your produce, put up a shack around them, it doesn't actually need daylight.
---
That makes sense.  The way it is always presented is "find someone from your last server and simply join their server".  I've questioned this multiple times and you are the first person to say "you have to send a friend request and have it accepted".  Thank you.
---
With legendary effects they do.
---
That's what I planned to try. Do you happen to know if the sheepsquatch's legs can be crippled?
---
I'm not gonna I disagree with this.. not only are smaller enemies not a secondary objective, but every body should be helping out and dealing with bosses after all some liks the queen scale with people that are there at the battle. This feels like you only focus on ads, all I can say is help out with small enemies and when you clearly see the boss at low health help out and get it done faster and don't think that you're the only one fighting off enemies as well. Theres a few examples I see of people hopping in and snatching kills and such, but that's apart of the games fee ault and dirt bag players who kill steal..
---
If you are looking for PvP, the answer is no. I am mainly a PvP players in most games, and this one just doesn't work.

No matter what we say the only opinion that matters is yours. And no one here is ever going to say this game is trash dont buy it. We are all loyal fans.

Go buy the game if you dont like it trade it in. And leave the forum in peace.
---
Yeah, people love to charge way too much for things like that. If you‚Äôre on PS4, become a regular at my shop! I‚Äôve got dozens of people that visit regularly because they know if it‚Äôs obtainable and I‚Äôve got it (like the Sheepsquatch weapons for instance), I‚Äôll get rid of it for dirt cheap or even free.

That's the thing I have so many people in this mad world who don't like something I do until I do what makes them happy. I do what I want to be happy. It's like my existence and purpose is a lie.
---
Muh roads
---
Good to know thank you! I have an explosive rifle character and this will be his strategy. I can also try various grenades on that character to see if any of them in particular help for this event boss.
---
Seems like there are more things to spend badge points on than there are badge points to earn - am I crazy?  Is it actually possible to get everything from the scout vending machines?
---
I don't know if he does PVP or PVE, he lives on the East Coast and I'm on the West so we don't get a lot of time that lines up to play together.
---
60% weight reduction.
---
Good to know that both work. Cool!
---
Had. Been using them slowly but surely over several months, and I crafted about 50 into Ultracite fusion cores, so I only have around 100 left. But they weigh like .1 or .2 each on my mule after the Batteries Included (90% weight reduction) and a few ammo weight reduction (20%) armor pieces.
---
i have a rifle (maybe an lmg), has 90% wr on it.. weighs 9lbs.. so that means it was like 99 lbs before? also wearing i think 2 wwr armors, saw that expecting a pound or two and seen 9lbs and thought holey hell this things over 100 normally?
---
i would have to agree the Fallout community in general is great and very helpful.
---
how much are maps selling for? I just put about 25 up for free the other day.
---
I always play solo, I don't think I've grouped with another player since I was under level 5.  I got through them OK.  Creep the imposter sheepsquatch event to get an easy revive.
---
You only need to complete a few of them, and you can pick easier ones (or at least ones that work), and do events for any other badges after that, without ever looking at the list.
---
Same here
---
Invest in Serums my friend don't sell them if you don't need the Caps. Serums are the future. It's like a 500$ bill-note ;)
---
Seit dem letzten patch ;)
---
Auch die challenges
---
Thats cool for you but fallout players all have their own builds and ways to play, alot of people dont rely on the cannibal perk for food.
---
So what your saying is that I shouldn't go to people's vendors cause its probably a waste of time? Yes that fixes the problem
---
You will go far in life, young padawan.
---
SERIOUSLY?!?! Wow, I literally played over 1k hours since it coming out and never knew about this till now... Thank you!!üëç
---
Yeah I figured as much
---
I agree ALSO just yesterday I did the SBQ, must have shot at least 200+ rounds into her. 100-ish before she mutated and 100-ish after she mutated or whatever you call it. I am also doing what you said, shooting the trash mobs and reviving people and there are still times I can't loot her. Does that happen to anyone else? Im not talking about tagging her once or twice and I am not shooting her with a bb gun. I see her take damage.
---
Just let me subscribe to event notifications from my personal terminal üôè
---
just do camp fire tales at camp adams for medals
---
I thought the BOS one was the hardest tbh, the bridge one your just running from one end to the other going between the yellow flags going up and down the ramps from the metal level up to road level and I walked it first so I knew where I was going, the ski resort is again running through flags with no balance beams that I remember but there were some enemies I had to take out along the way, took me 3 times to do the BOS one because of the balance beams etc, I‚Äôd say do a really slow practice run without activating the button a couple or more times, the cooking one requires a recipe that needs royal jelly and apparently that recipe only works with one type of royal jelly thats not easy to come by, I‚Äôd say try the other courses and see how you get on and if you can get those under your belt see how you feel about keeping at it with the BOS one, I hope you can get your tadpole badges soon, good luck with it
---
during that last interview at what was it pax east, todd made a comment that someone mailed him a box of bobbypins and told him to weigh these.. maybe same needs to be done with weapons..   
---
or maybe they all need to take a trip to one of those vegas gun rental places and get schooled a lil and while they are at it shown the difference between a .308 and a .50 cal
---
Right, it is evidence that just because you flash something on the screen does not mean people are going to flock.
---
It is the same as the SBQ or encrypted when people are busy doing other things or don't care.
---
The notification does not mean people are going to show up.
---
12 to 15 sb to get 3 meat? There is a perk (i think its called butcher‚Äôs bounty) that gives a 80% to find extra meat when searching their corpse, when it works for me, it gives me a scorchbeast meat and never a liver, brain, lung or heart (not sure if its supposed to be that way but it was always that way for me)
---
I agree with the notification, however on point 3. 
---
You have about 25 minutes to start the event once you get to the basement. Unfortunately most people run up and initiate the computer right away. If they'd put event timers visible on the map, this would help, or have it so the event will only start via computer is 4 or more players are in the area.
---
No idea, I've got a few hundred rounds but never used it because it doesn't seem to do a lot of damage.  I've seen one used effectively on SBQ battles, especially when it's landed and a person keeps the SBQ slowed so badly it's down on the ground constantly.
---
oh god why did I not find your server.....
---
Absolutely agree. I love new content and find wild appalachia one amazing, but I am also starting to enjoy less the game, like on beta / release, due to those reasons.
---
Server and game optimization pass before more content please!
---
I put mine out for just that reason - it‚Äôs the right stuff to make adhesive (and veggie soup) plus the cook station is outside.
---
Don't rush em... lol
---
Always keep in mind there is a tiny, tiny chance if one thing get's solved, five other issues pop up.
---
Yeah, I risked life and limb more than once while playing Subnautica to get some truly epic shots... just so I could hang them on my wall.
---
Took me 2 hours to get my backpack solo  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
Yes they are tedious but it's not that bad. Just do athlete, archer and hunter. Possum on the other hand is pretty bad.
---
I probably once sold my 3star chest piece because it was gone. Annoying thing is, from player vendor price would be 500-1000 but game vendors buy those for 30 caps so you not only loose everything, you might not notice it happening.
---
Plans.
---
Plaaaaaaaaaaaaaans..
---
Yeeeeessssss... plaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanssssss......
---
I'm fairly sure that you can rarely get possum badges via the two daily quests and the camp fire tales event. But I don't know of alternative ways to get tadpole badges other than challenges.
---
Fasnacht plans/recipes
---
level 1-5 weapons (not that I make much from those)
---
Anything bloodied/explosive
---
I'm sure it would be stims, but I could never get them to get listed (weight/budget problems).  I may try to get around that in the near future.
---
Am i litterally the only person on the entire earth that never had problems in the game?
---
It would help if the dungeon as a whole was not about as stable as a house of cards in a hurricane. 
---
Seriously I've had two runs where we got the Alpha killed before a crash, one of those I got to loot before lockup and being forced to close the 76 processes and return to the desktop.
---
Cool story, bro
---
It's fine - it's customer service
---
For every enemy but the queen, you tag it once, you get loot.  I think it's absolutely insane that the queen doesn't work that way, but over all I'd say your objection to that system is silly. Hitting a enemy, once, isn't hard, unless someone single-shots the thing.   
---
And in theory I agree we should be able to trade collectables...but I understand why you can't. The collection tasks are there to encourage exploration. I could see them changing everything to work like the bobbleheads...you have to use it, not just find it... but even then, farmers would be selling magazines for people who are to lazy to actually play the game to farm those atoms with.
---
Sell junk.....
---
Is this hosted on any podcast apps?
---
Just stop the juke about a third of the way through the meter. Let the clock run as long as possible. Some servers will let a lot of extra legendary spawn. Some servers only one extra.
---
You could call it the GHOUL- lag haha...
---
We were promised this in the early on bullshit hype sessions.
---
I'll do it for a hotdog.
---
I am a horrible person, good call
---
Oh interesting
---
Huh, so I already have a melee build, with full 9 points of slugger, martial artist, incisor, bloody mess, ect. I have twisted muscles, if I get a bloody weapon, what other things would you reccomend?
---
Bugs that waste your time are their lowest priority. They want your time to be wasted so you spend more time playing. That's why bugs that save you time get fixed within days.
---
I have a hunters 50 Cal this makes it a little more useful to carry around
---
If you‚Äôre not collecting materials for crafting, sell just without scrapping it.
---
I thought crops were instanced though?
---
tl:dr can't hack it in survival so harasses Adventure players
---
Make an offer
---
The best is when it spawns the ash pile like 100 feet in the air. We set up a camp once and used the spiked board trap that launches you up in the air in an attempt to loot it, but it was a huge pain.
---
Not exactly. You can already exploit nuke zone spawns, and RLS would make that behavior more rampant. What I'm asking is can the dev team maybe consider working on how spawns work in 76 so this kind of grind doesn't become the new normal.
---
I agree. All the sheepsquatch side quests and main could be done in a day.   I actually like that there's something to do for a while in game. The arktos is an event for lots of people. I think it's a good balance of content added
---
Just...don't play music? Until the last 5ish minutes, then get a group jamming.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the reply!
---
i think it was rifle gaming who recently did a video on this, went to a lvl 35 super mutant horde event, and it was spawning 68 3\* legendaries for him as he left the boss alone. till some random came up and killed the boss.
---
I pvped a guy who kept shooting me and of course he slaughtered me. Then he dumped a bunch of ammo and aid items in my paper bag and left. Bro tier
---
MODS: Does this look like your fucking automod script works? Pin this post you cowards!
---
If you can gather (with the right perks) 10 plants, you should be able to feed yourself for several hours.  Water too if you use them to make soup.
---
Cleaning you out every 30 minutes is a bit excessive.  I know you're OK with it, but that's still a lot to take.
---
I plant 10 carrots at my camp, and I harvest at most 1 time over day, or 2 if I'm playing all day.  And I collect water when I'm home every so often (6 at a time), but I usually end up vendoring most of those.
---
gotcha, thank you for the reply
---
Pretty much every other FO76 video is somebody reading the patch notes or narrating a new mechanic that everyone did yesterday at the same time as the youtuber.
---
I had a ton of weapons and armor stashed so mostly those, plans and aid.
---
I apologize for the purified waters, I unlocked mine because of this and player vending.
---
Train stations for grinders. Berkeley (I think) for the vendor.
---
The archery trick is just go into 3rd person view and put the dot over the center of the target you get a lot of time to complete the test. I also did the hunting it was easy the hardest part was killing a Yao Guai ( mountainside bed and breakfast  just jump on the train car) with a syringer I just shot it with another weapon till there was a sliver of life left and dispatched it with the syringer. The obstacle course I got 1 blue screen and 2 disconnected from server last night hopefully tonight will be the night.
---
I have 10 of each plant, with i think 25 gourds planted (i make alot of relish). So yeah can get loaded at my farm.
---
Berkeley station for the purveyor, exchange machines for a the currency at every station.
---
How long did you wait?
---
I constantly find myself waiting several minutes for them to load after this latest patch.
---
Unfortunately, 90% WR doesn't apply to any mods you apply to the weapon.
---
When i play in survival i generally shoot straight to the top of the leader boards due to the fact that i actively hunt the top 3 , even the punks hiding in base covered with turrets can still be had with the right strategy. That being said it is still more fun to murder the unsuspecting players in adventure, and it pays better . So dont cry and tell me to go to survival, why arent you in pacifist mode playing house at your base . This is the wasteland
---
Have a bloodied grog and adrenal reactions. That thing is my baby
---
No need to apologize, it regrows in 7 minutes.  If you truly feel any remorse, which isn't necessary, just be sure you repair any crops you see damaged when you're at a CAMP.
---
That is true. Your right. A server wide timer would be great. Also, would be nice if no one could initiate until there is a minimum number of people there.
---
You think that's bad? Imagine shooting scorchbeast with gatling plasma and seeing it blew up into green goo midair. It's just like "blubs" and the bubble is gone. Nothing remains to be looted. So worth 10min intense battle, 7 plasma cores, 20 stimpaks and 15xp.
---
Sexual themes; as in how you can dress your character. Profanity; as in drug &amp; alcohol use, and mild language. Violence; as in Raider encampments with body parts strewn about, heads on steaks, bodies used as decorations and the ability to dismember, behead, and mulch enemy mobs. I would definitely say that seeing a Scorchbeast, Deathclaw, or Mirelurk Queen can be a nightmare inducing element...
---
any other clarification you need?
---
Oh and if it‚Äôs personal attacks you‚Äôre looking for, I was talking to those of you in this thread that let your kids watch or play ‚ÄòM‚Äô rated video games as a whole, not just you snowflake! 
---
Quit being bad parents, if you want your kids to be sheltered upright citizens, it‚Äôs just logic.
---
Get pharma finder, find more chems, keep the ones you need and sell the surplus. 
---
Also, a few passes through Morgantown airport can help as you can sell the stuff you find at the train station next door. As someone noted sell the stuff you don‚Äôt need unscrapped (ie sell the toaster, not the parts) and any weapons you find that you don‚Äôt care about mods for. Weapons that have been modded already sell for more than base weapons.
---
This times a fucking thousand. Let me be the overpowered bloodied beast that I am, destroying enemies in a rain of .50 cal bullets as they explode into bloody chunks all around me, and not feel bad about it. Instead of being the asshole that killed something before everyone could tag it, I'd be the cool guy that shreds enemies and everyone benefits. This game is supposed to be about teamwork but it actively discourages you from playing with others. It's far more efficient to play solo and give zero damns about anyone else around you.
---
I can see this getting patched withing a week or two. I'm gonna have to try this before it's too late.
---
&gt;I said what I said in my reply because I want you to realize that you made your own argument for passive lock picking and hacking irrelevant. You want them to change two of the most powerful utility perk cards in the game because you refuse to play a build that uses those few cards over a few other cards that I assume you currently use to maximize your damage, and you are tired of switching to lock picking and hacking cards when you want to access terminals and locked doors. Am I right?
---
They are not powerful utility perk cards because you can ignore them with little consequences. Powerful utility perk cards would be gun smith that allows you better gun modifications and reduces weapon durability loss, ammo smith that increases total ammo created and super duper that will randomly double what ever it is you just made. 
---
They are useful bonuses which would be fine as stand along perk cards IF AND ONLY IF this game didn't require maximizing damage to do anything.  The inclusion of legendary weapons has made them balance all mobs even every day mobs around the potential of legendary weapons. Thus even a level 50 fully upgraded .50 cal hunting rifle is unable to kill a level 20 Super Mutant in one shot without maxing out damage and armor penetration.  Hence why Scorch Beast Queen has an effect that auto reduces all damage she takes by 80% because it was the only way to make her challenging and require multiple people when the game was launched and since then not much has changed. 
---
You ignore the details that are inconvenient to your argument the game rail roads you into doing this or else a Yao Gaui level 40 can kill you even in level 50 power armor or a level 50 3 star Mirelurk King will kill you in literally 3 hits unless you are dealing insane amounts of damage. Shit the game is so based on legendary weapons there have been multiple calls on this sub reddit and bethesda's community forum to ban non legendary weapons from player's vendors because they are in fact beyond pointless to exist once you reach max level. 
---
&gt; Then, with that being said and agreed on, if you believe that there is  absolutely nothing of value behind terminals and locked doors, why do  you want them to change two powerful perk cards and potentially change  the whole system; including a lot of peoples builds? 
---
Lock picking and Hacking are not going to change a lot of people's builds because they do just what I do. Swap it in and out as they see fit.  Literally everything you can do now is what I suggest just removing the unnecessary 10 second hassle of opening pip boy, loading up perks, removing perks needed to open up space, browsing though perk list and equipping the necessary ones. 
---
Now if I was talking about also including weight reduction perks and boosting perks (longer food, more health, etc) then that would alter people's builds but direct open constant effects like that are not what I'm suggesting because of their constant benefit. 
---
&gt; Added, who the hell knows what future content will be. 
---
So you have no argument so you have to argue about the possibility of the future? Lol that is funny and sad because it isn't an argument. Their existing updates which gives the only true view on how they will do future update doesn't support that. And while it is true that you can claim maybe but I can say the same thing about maybe in the future my wife would be open to a threesome with another woman. Statistically speaking it is a possibility however all current data on the subject says no. 
---
&gt; To you sir, I say. You already have passive lock picking and hacking, at  level 0. Deal with it, or invest in the perks to improve it, or keep  switching your perk cards and be happy they allow that.  
---
What is there to be happy about?  If this was any other game it would be a passive effect allowing me to have as many perks regardless of level. So I could have every perception perk there is in the game active at once maxed out even with only 10 perception.  Any other game doesn't base all mobs on end game content making even the most basic enemy mob able to take maxed out weapons as if it is nothing.  
---
In Ark my Apprentice level long neck rifle is still able to take down a level 20 Raptor in one shot because the gun is strong and they are low level.  In fact with my Acenion level long neck rifle I can nearly instant kill a lot of 50 and below mobs save the high HP ones in one shot.
---
I‚Äôve only one hotdog and it‚Äôs already promised to another. How about some water and the satisfaction of a scout earning a badge?
---
I've accidentally sold armor pieces before because I was in power armor at the time. When in PA all your armor appears unequipped, so it can be very easy to accidentally sell. 
---
I know Feed the People also used to have an issue where it would occasionally eat weapons or armor, although I've been out of the loop for a bit so perhaps that's been fixed.
---
Check Bethesda's Fallout Instagram page, they posted today top 10 sellers. And while at it, take a peak into comment section...
---
thank you!
---
I play heavy tank so its fun to hook up with a melee guy and help them get their hard to kill critters. Its fun to shoot a cancer bat until it land then watch them get beat to death by someone with a sledge hammer.
---
Have noticed 3* mobs dropping more 2* items.
---
sorry I should have searched
---
Don‚Äôt forget the area between Harpers and the fort. 
---
There‚Äôs enough traffic in this area between quest runners, loot farmers, and brotherhood turn in people to make it advantageous to be here. 
---
Not as much traffic as ws, but also not many camps taking up your spot either if you choose well.
---
Have broken visors
---
We should be able to choose notifications in our personal terminal
---
I‚Äôm on PC. I don‚Äôt play enough online games to warrant paying for PS+ or Live Gold.
---
Glad to help. When I'm grinding in a nuke zone, I always click every player marker I find on the map and add everyone, starting with the people near me. Usually, someone will accept and you can rejoin on them if they stay on. 
---
Also, if you team up with some randoms, you can "join team" from the main menu without being friends, as long as you were on a team when you crash or quit the game *to desktop* (***not*** "quit to main menu"!)
---
Oddly, this worked in Fallout 1 and Fallout 2.
---
Yet here we are, 74 iterations later (:P) and it's apparently beyond the current tech :)
---
If you have to drop to adventure to farm resources you aren't doing that great in Survival.
---
Do more tadpole plans populate in that machine?    I purchased what was available. There were 4 or 5 in there and then a bunch of tadpole clothing. I still have a few tadpole challenges left. 
---
I‚Äôm not talking possum challenges, I know there are all the backpack mods there.
---
This is one of the most-requested features since launch, along with Perk Card Loadouts and Text Chat.  They've shown no indication that they're going to make it happen.
---
No disrespect here. The secondary are a huge roll. Many times I've gone into a event and had to do add control while low level players are trying to dps the boss. I'm over 200 in level and am stuck killing easy adds. With that said if you are killing adds make sure you get a tag on the boss. Everyone by now should know the mechanics of the game. Tag the boss a couple times and continue on add duty. 
---
During some of the these events. Lower level legendaries sometimes appear. If I'm putting dps on the boss and don't get tags on the lower level legendaries I should not get any of that loot. 76 after all is a a survival game. If you put in work you get paid. If you don't get tags on the boss that's on the player. You get exp and event items if the event is cleared.
---
Build the free terminal in your camp. It will reveal locations of what you need and all future new content.
---
Mom always told me i was special!
---
I think you asking just too much. The technology isn't there yet.
---
Kill scorched near vendors and sell their weapons.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve got my C.A.M.P. in the forest right now near Flatwoods with crops and purifiers intended for folks to partake if needed.
---
Project Paradise has frozen twice requiring the game to be shut down. Definitely time to fix the game before more additions.
---
I‚Äôm on XBox one as well and I‚Äôm down! I totally feel your pain on that one because it took me forever. I finally got it during an event, thankfully! My GT is TangentSugar426 if you need me to die! Just let me know!
---
Maybe, either way it's gonna take a while to farm the stuff again...
---
I've died at the same moment the ISS goes down and the game bugs out everytime and leaves me unable to respawn....I've seen it happen to others as well.  Makes me Alt-F4 the game.
---
This. Right. Here. Time to kill is way too fast. There's no time to react and almost zero build diversity.
---
I bought one because I don't feel like doing the event on my new character.
---
Go ahead and waste that stash space
---
Sell to npc vendors for 1400 a day. Cooked food, chems, outfits (some sell to vendors for tons while weighing almost nothing), junk/weapons/armor.
---
I love dying! If you‚Äôre on rn, I can join your world?
---
I had a player who one-hit-killed Sheepsquash before anyone could tag it
---
Its not even the event, unless its someone on the server doing the event...I can't stay in the game for more than 5-10 mins before a random ctd
---
If you're ever at my CAMP, take any food that's available, and any water in the purifiers.  It's all unlocked, regenerates in minutes and I'm not out anything if you help yourself to it.  You have no reason to feel bad.
---
The really enthusiastic coach for the athletics courses was amazing and I hope I hear more from him.
---
And that he resolves his mom issues.
---
Right, cause every player drops me a packet of lead and steel on death.  Yours is  the very falsehood I'm speaking against.
---
I can confirm this one. I saw the video as well and jumped right on and server hopped  untill I found about 3 or 4 hordes. Every single time I was able to secure multiple legendaries. Of course the fun always ended when Johnnyhungfunny showed up and killed the horde leader each and every time.
---
I was helping on a encryptid quest yesterday, we got right to the end, killed the mobs and the boss and then some asshat in Nuka cola PA came up to me (at least 50 levels above me) and one shots me with some sort of crazy fucking melee weapon and then ransacked my loot. This was a big event with at least 10 people participating.
---
Fucking asshat.
---
If I am not mistaken, it was leaked that they are going to expand the faction later. No source.
---
hey, I went through the steps to get the replacement bag as well but I notice when i go to [betheda.net](https://betheda.net) and look for the support ticket under "My Tickets" I no longer see the canvas bag ticket is that where I am supposed to look?
---
I totally agree, It also sucks when you are playing in a group and have to choose to kill that one legendary or try to kite it around so everyone in your party can get a hit on it.
---
Besides weapons/armor, serums at 300, plans/recipes at half face value, Teddy Bears/Mr. Fuzzies at 10 caps.
---
You underestimate my ability to cram junk
---
Doh! Someone will help you out then
---
Funny
---
No, there should be a damage screen like there is in destiny that shows all players damage to the boss and those who do a certain amount should get the rewards. I'm sick of you lvl 12's and 2 shot explosive kids getting rewarded for 0.356275 damage done.
---
It was only thing I was waiting about this game's multiplayer stuff. I'm not team player, I am the most solo RPG guy ever but building a huge post apocalyptic makeshift camp together sounded like a heaven. "Rebuild the world... except not. Actually... nuke it"
---
Did you watch 'i want to eat your pancreas' it's a lovely anime I recommend it
---
You are the echo chamber
---
This. I'd never even seen one used before. Was all like, "That's it?" and scrapped it.
---
Not yet. I submitted it to iTunes, Stitcher and others. There's an approval process that takes a few weeks. Once it's there. I'll give a shout.
---
Toxic Valley, if nuked correctly, yields over 500 violet flux with the Green Thumb perk.
---
Honestly, Bethesda. Go fuck yourselves.
---
thats  just it 
---
i've gone to four train stations 
---
medical and ammo  vendors but no  terminal
---
they are the giant machines that have the words "leg  é…π…ê pu«ù" on them
---
Read...my...comment... Since you didn't. "Only if you don't already have a decent 1-2 star" Covering your "objection" to my view was the majority of my comment. 
---
And I disagree pretty strongly with this "3'd star ranks aren't usually useful anyway" nonsense. I've gotten two  3 stars that had primary and secondary affects that were keeping. A quad explosive and a bloody explosive. The first had 90% reduced weight, which is good on _any weapon_, and the second had +15% reload speed, which is good on _any gun_ . 
---
The number of 3'd star rolls which are useful for any any weapon (even if not for your specific play style) vastly outweigh the garbage rolls. Honestly, I'd say there _are_ no garbage 3'd star rolls. 
---
Any +stat 3'd is useful. Agility? More AP? NICE. Perception? More accuracy at range? Thank you! 15% faster reload?? In reality that's a fucking awesome damage boost, you spend more time putting bullets on the target, and are less likely to get re-load interrupted by a stagger.  Reduced vats AP cost? More vats hits, more crits, more damage! +vat crit build. More vats crits, more damage.  +dr while reloading/aiming? You're in the fight longer, better over-all damage! 90% reduced weight? More room for ammo and other toys. 
---
Some, like VATS stats aren't useful for all players, because not all players USE vats. But it's still a value-add if you're going to sell the gun, and it does no harm if you get it.  Some, like +dr while aiming, make more sense for builds that are particularly susceptible to 1-hit kills, like bloodied builds. 
---
Over on the melee side, it's a bit worse...15% less damage while blocking only applies to a select playstyle, but it's still not a bad thing to have. 40% less damage while power attacking is the same sort of thing...if you do a lot of power attacks, it's awesome, if you don't, it's not.
---
To be fair, I‚Äôve done something like this but I just wanted to help them...
---
Hell, I just discovered the downed space station for the first time in about 100 hours of playing.  At this rate I'll never see an alien.  But I would settle for the tourist with the damn camera.
---
Nah, the tse shotgun was nerfed especially bad. That gun was on my back for nearly 100 levels and now sits in a box. This "fix" was nearly as bad as the initial nerf again.
---
Yet while i pepper something with half a dozen shells, some asshat in a bunny suit is running around one stabbing shit that i can barely scratch. Makes total sense.
---
There's a bunch of ways
---
1) Max out your daily cap limit to vendors: I tend to sell off things like glowing meat steaks, diluted stimpaks and radaways, and chems. I also try to sell off any food items that might be spoiling soon. If you slot even just 1 point in Pharma Farma, you'll be getting enough extra stuff to sell
---
2) Hitting cap stashs: get yourself Cap Collector and look for cap stashes. You can make a pretty penny for not a lot of effort. I tend to just hit the cap stashes at Poseidon (there's like 10 here) as well as at Whitesprings and Morgantown because I go to those places a frequently.
---
3) Set up a vendor station at your camp. If you price to sell, things will go. Some of the stuff you sell to the npc vendors may also be sold here.
---
Unless you have some super, ultra rare stuff, it takes a little while, but you can get a couple thousand caps a days
---
You all sound sick.  Take a cough drop and go to bed early tonight.
---
Super mutants tend to drop caps. If you can make it to Summerville, you can farm them (and sell their weapons).
---
Also we should get more storage
---
Why is that. Because you sell them to the vendor. I just do a run on WesTek and Cal clear out my vendor with assault rifles. The serums are just extra caps each day. I can clear over 10k in one day.
---
Did you ever get it? I‚Äôm in need as well.
---
Distance is quite small unfortunately, something that can be sprinted in one-two seconds
---
Yeah,  i did.
---
It should honestly do damage about on par with the gauss rifle for the fire speed.
---
Kewl.
---
"valuable loot" I didn't see aluminum in that list, nice try. Trying to pretend your a caring heart, but you hoard it to yourself, you monster. 
---
Imposter Sheepsquatch? Is it that hard? Cause i can't level much anymore cause the REAL SHEEPSQUATCH KEEPS COMING TO FONDLE MY TWINKIES.
---
Buy assaultron cards!  Be ready to tank the conduits! You won't be at your cap max for long!
---
They don't see what you named it.
---
This loose seats and just waiting to clip your tip when you sit on them.
---
True, but i ground the hell out of boss fights for my stuff. Queens and squashes, endless nuke zones and now vendor rolling.
---
I do not want to end up having to join the masses with the damn unarmed or melee bloodied weapons and sentinel/unyielding gear. I have a set of unyielding, but rarely use it...
---
Make bosses harder. Can't keep relying on nerfs. I want a damn bloodied nerf.
---
I haven‚Äôt been able to do Queen of the hunt since December it just doesn‚Äôt start :/
---
Don't let these guys get you down. I'd say try the fo76 filthy casual Reddit but they're not about pvp. 
---
Pvp is still in "beta" so it isn't that good. 
---
Although people are thinking this upcoming summer's nuclear winter update (contradictory) is going to be a battle royale.
---
Go to Morgantown Airport, kill all scorched, collect ALL weapons, sell at Morgantown station.  Server hop and repeat until caps are gone.
---
Generally, super mutants, robots, cryptids and the like.
---
Give them away to new players. If I'm feeling super generous, I load them up with excavator power armor (level 25) and mod them with calibrated shocks, emegency protocol chest mod, and targeting hud. Press R to drop it from you inventory - now anyone can pick it up. 
---
I usually leave them at the Overseer's camp along with some full fusion cores in the stash.
---
So what resources are you getting from Adventure players?
---
Or do you go farm in Adventure and camp the Whitesprings train station in Survival?
---
Not only the boss, everyone in an event that participated in any way (dealt damage, revived, played objective) should be able to loot enemies and get XP for them. ALL of them.
---
Also can they finally fix the XP shit that is being in a group and only receiving loot and XP if you tagged and enemy? That really ruins group play :/
---
Gotcha. Thank you for the info.
---
I play pvp.
---
I farm resources within pvp if I run low. Don't need to go to adventure to pick on unsuspecting players. 
---
To me, it's more fun trying to kill someone actively trying to hide from me and survive.
---
Adventure, they aren't even paying attention to you for the most part. Seems like an easy kill for an unskilled player tbo.
---
Yeah some QoL improvements are verrrry necessary
---
They should really make this more clear.
---
You are correct sir, I run a bloodied heavy build exclusively and can confirm - using vats tanks my AP super fast on my .50 cal, gatling plasma, etc. I still use it from time to time, mostly for quickly lining up shots on enemies. I then exit VATS and take the shot manually.
---
That's hot
---
You can be in different rooms in the Arktos Lab and it wont let you loot the bodies your teammates killed.
---
I know, I just tend be a lone wanderer.
---
My CAMP is by the vault, and one of my 4 vending machines is specifically for new players. Level 1, 5, and 10 weapons and armor. I make sure the weapons are fixed with a good stock, long barrel and scope. The hand guns will have a silencer for sneaking. I sell them for between 5-12 caps with signs asking higher level players to please leave the low items for newer players. It's cool when new players come through and are excited to get a sniper rifle for the few caps they have on them. But sometimes players well over level 100 and 200 go through it and buy out the whole inventory (I assume to sell them higher).
---
Question: Is there any way to lock a vending machine so items can only be sold to players under level 10 or 15? If so I'd like to sell them for even less. If not has that request been asked about before? My other 3 vending machines are full of higher level items.
---
We had a group. Two people minimum in each sector,  Two in mine (sector B) but one of the others had 3 or more and not one had made it to 3 out of 3.  And this is a group where everybody knew each other and knew what the plan was.
---
Whatever it is, I just want real end game content. RAIDS that are challenging and require the best gear and optimized high dps / tanky builds.
---
The queen does not scale based on the number of people.
---
Ya and I appreciate the disclaimer, just think it muddied ur point abit.
---
This exact thing happened to me. What confuses me was that it was my first time doing the event. I figured it out....how dumb are people that they cant read the big text saying "ACTIVATE THE PYLONS"
---
Impostor?  No, I don't think they can be crippled.  Regular, I am pretty sure they can be.
---
Yeah, I was on defensive measures for the tick and I ran in and tagged the fog crawler and ran back to protect the tick just in case.
---
You guys are lucky or your platform and hardware is simply more stable. I get multiple disconnects and at least 1 full crash of the application every day on PS4. It hasn't really gotten better or worse since I started in January. I really should have given up when it took me 3 hours to leave the vault the first time I played. I learned that day that your character isn't created until you exit the vault doors and that joins a world. My first 2 were lost and I had to start over completely because I got disconnected in the final room.
---
Keep running your mouth little man cuz we both know thats all you do
---
Yeah, extra keys. I haven't tried it yet because I always forget to see if it really works, or possibly worked in a pervious version
---
Wow now that's just a slap in the face. I hate when some players do that. I sold tinker workbenches and chemistry station plans for 10 caps and someone bought a bunch. Dude its for those players who don't have it not for you to buy and then resell for a higher value.
---
I tried 7 times to join by fast traveling to the building itself and going down the elevator. Crashed Everytime.
---
Joined off the icon and fast traveled to the actual event icon.... Got in first and second time I tried it that way.
---
Haven't tried that way a third.
---
Might try changing how you travel to that building. 
---
NOTE: JUST GIVING INFO ON MY EXPERIENCE. NOT SAYING IT ABSOLUTELY HELPS BUT THAT'S HOW I WAS ABLE TO JOIN IT.
---
I just go to 76 and drop all the junk plans I have. No need to sell them
---
We had 6 people or more, two people minimum in each sector but one of them had 3 or more, Not a single one of them to to 3/3.
---
I leave everything unlocked. Hope you make some nice drinks with the grain.
---
Adventure World, If i am standing over you then i am trying to revive you. Don't worry i am not stealing your junk.
---
Get the vending machine and sell your extra plans and sell random ammo you know you won't use
---
You are an excellent credit to the human race. Just sayin‚Äô.
---
Ill try that when it becomes available
---
Why make another post about something already posted about.
---
The game encourages you to play with others.
---
Most can be done solo but some stuff requires a friend/random.
---
As suggested in every other post regarding this: post an lfg and many people will join you to help.
---
I think I have fixed it now my dude
---
There is also a terminal that gives you a shut down code for The main computer Erica which switches the quest leader to a mr handy
---
I am new to the post-50 world and don't want to be "that person". I'd love it if someone would type up a quick guide to being a good citizen, which is the way I like to play.
---
I have tried alive and dead, neither are counting (PC).
---
Most Excellent!(swear) Waste Acid shot with a Nuka Dark chaser always does the trick.
---
That may be impressive but there were 2 million player deaths to the imposter sheepsquatch.
---
+F for us.
---
I haven't been playing actively lately, just popped in to see what's new, and... this is *still* an issue? And let me guess, being in a Party still means nothing towards getting XP, too, unless you manage to "tag" the enemy? I remember being surprised by that back during the beta - I'd just *assumed* XP would be shared between Party members, and they'd all get loot, because that'd be intuitive and make sense... honestly, it's things like this that caused me to take a break from the game. It's like half of the game *wants* to be multiplayer, yet the other half of the game doesn't work right with MP *at all*... :(
---
I wonder if it's los?
---
1. Kill/loot shit
---
2. ???
---
3. Profit
---
I wouldn't even bother with wasting perk cards on scrounger/pharma etc or weight reducing cards either .. within a week or 2 you're gonna have all the recipes you'll need and as long as you fully loot the areas you explore your ammo/aid/chems/junk will add up regardless so I spend my perk points on damage first so I progress quicker.
---
Remember to pick up as much junk as you can in each area you explore .. workbench&gt;scrap all then once the lesser junk piles up to over 100-200 bulk it to keep around 40-50 or so and vendor the bulk .. I only keep important junk like bal.fiber/plastic/acid/lead over 500
---
I recommend carryin 2-6 whiskey, 20 or so stimmys and 10-20 radaway /psyco(buff/tat/w.e) .. fk radx .. everything else sell to the vendor for phat lewtz
---
Check bathroom mirrors/unique ghouls etc for aid/chem recipes or do the miner stash down south/west of the map .. the miner lockers seem like a good source for those recipes too.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone‚Äôs finally speaking up.
---
If this wiki ( [https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck) ) is correct it shows how luck affects the durability of drops (and consequently the base vendor value) and I agree it's not enough to warrant investing in luck just for that. However, if you use vats luck does significantly contribute to filling the critical meter faster (L:1-&gt;6.5 - L:15-&gt;27.5) and that may or may not be useful for your build on it's own. For me, I believe it makes the biggest difference on my shotgun character since each pellet seems to trigger various effects individually (medic's for sure; I have not verified if each pellet contributes to filling the critical meter but if it does then luck is more valuable for shotguns versus other single "shot" weapons). I use a varying degree of luck on different character builds whether they use vats or not. For me how much luck a build has is mostly determined by which luck perk cards I want in the build. You're welcome on the correction. I'm glad to help clarify. Also, I was curious myself because it could have changed how I played some of my characters.
---
Hello there =). I just found a Bloody + 25% FR + Reload Speed combat shotgun. Do you think that's a good weapon after the explosive nerf on shotguns, or is BE still a better option? Can you tell me your average time to kill SBQ with a good shotgun build? Curious for comparison to my B25 .50 cal build.
---
Sure let me start this 40min walk to this guys vendor. 10mins goes by. Aaaaand he's gone
---
My girlfriend loves watching me play it because she likes the style and concept of the whole game. That‚Äôs what makes me want to play more but the building aspect is my favorite part. Except when you want to put something over some stairs... Now that vending is a thing I pretty much log on and travel to peoples camps and check out their designs and see what they have for sale.
---
&gt;my friends would laugh over it and crack all sort of jokes so I kind of just felt like it wasn't worth it   
---
&gt;I'm sure there's toxic people out there, but considering I haven't met a single one   
---
You have met them, but luckily most have excluded themselves from the game
---
Are you on PC? Using mods?
---
Somebody threw down a mobile missile platform the other day during a queen battle. It was glorious.
---
Yes! I think with events like this it opens the door for player made guilds to coordinate events like this. Imagine 3 teams of 4 all coordinating and maximizing the arktos events, squach events and other multiplayer events. For a multiplayer game, it lacks a lot of multiplayer facets innate to a multiplayer game.
---
Seriously. Being able to build cohesive settlements with other players is one of the only awesome things about games like RUST and ARk, to my mind.  Being able to have a group of friends build one, cohesive camp?
---
Like a system that would work the best to my mind is, you have a "guild". Or a "gang" in this game I guess would make more sense.  It's a limited number of players, 4-6? And you can choose to combine your camp build area and budget and resources. Every time any one of those players logs in, the entire camp, everyone's budget, is placed.
---
Imo this game will never be balanced. 
---
Between legendary weapons + armors + food + drink + chems + bobbleheads + magazines + perks + mutations + etc, there is just to much going on to balance every possible combination.
---
You‚Äôre going to get a lot of extra mileage with sneak and covert operative perks. Rifleman or commando is a given. Bloody mess, too. If you opt for commando, you‚Äôre going to be fixing that thing nonstop, even with rank 5 gunsmith.  I prefer the 35 round stinging mag for the armor penetration. 85 round drum looks good on paper, but the AP effect of the stinging mag is so much better. Oh, also tank killer perk. Max out all rifle and tank killer perks and toss in glow sight for the full 15 perception stat.
---
I think part of it is dumb luck as it's down to spawn rates. The radstag one is probably easiest if you get a lot of them. Annoyingly the last group I saw that got a deathclaw completely neglected it when the alpha came so it got murdered by wolves and yogis.
---
Ya pretty helpful info, not too hard about Legendary farming personally, but if u feel the urge, now I know how 2 go about it.
---
Please do,  I'd like to check this out

&gt;You all sound sick. Take a **cough** drop and go to bed early tonight.
---
---------------------  
---
Oh no, you got it too
---
I‚Äôve seen this complaint and I‚Äôm pretty surprised. The only dailies I‚Äôve done more often than that one are the Biv daily and the new ones for the Pioneer Scouts. 
---
Crazy how it‚Äôs bugged for so many hit kit others.
---
Anything I don't lock, including my crops, is fair game.
---
Honestly, if I need corn or razorgrain, I equip green thumb and spend 5 minutes at Silva Farmstead for corn, and the field just south of Billings Homestead workshop for razorgrain. Always walk away with over 80 of each from just a couple of minutes running around spamming "E"
---
What also affects the gun's weight is the different receivers which shouldn't change the weight of a gun even if it's for balance it makes no sense. A gun with select fire weighs the same in full-auto and in Semi-auto and not two different weights.In Fallout New Vegas we had different ammo types to deal with different threats instead of mags that magically added armor piercing to the bullets and add weight which is true to larger mags. Also someone explain to me how a short barrel weighs more than a long barrel?
---
Agree on the melee thing. Still prefer being a rifleman tho :)
---
There's an Arktos backpack skin too
---
Plot twist, I've had it for the last week!  I am patient zero!
---
If you ever passed by my camp and took some razor grain, you are welcome. Same goes for any of my crops, water, even resources from an extractor should I have one.
---
Theres plenty to go round.
---
sounds like an exploit to me... QUICK NERF IT TO THE GROUND
---
Just the opposite, they should limit it to 25K per account. Nothing in this game should cost more than 25K caps.
---
Nah it's the same color as the ultracite laser rifle / pistol. A prime Gatling Laser (uses ultracite fusion cores) still shoots red though.
---
I've played a bunch in both and most pvp players who try to fight/grief in adventure aren't good like for instance I can usually win with just my quad crossbow which is fun but pretty bad
---
So, you want them to change the menu mechanic they have always used, just for you? Hm......
---
The cap is to limit the amount available in game. We need cap limits and cap sinks or dupers will ruin the economy even more than it is now.
---
Yes, you need to limit what you sell when near your cap limit.
---
Almost did that by myself. Fell into it while doing a trivial quest and instead of leaving like I usually do decide to try it.
---
 After some fooling around figured out how to herd them and took em' up to the farm, murdering the odd problem on the way. Almost got there and another guy shows up and starts helping with the trash. They go in the pen and the Sheep thing spawns. I had no idea that's what this was. Laughed and pulled out my new Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher and noticed I had descended to about 2/3 Health on the way. Almost 300 a shot at that level. I think the other guy and a new guy who showed up were a bit surprised.
---
 Down it went and I forget what it had for loot. Cool event I guess. ;0
---
aka enlisted military personnel (I was in for 6 years)

thought I was in r/fo76FilthyCasuals for a second.
---
Perhaps Adventure mode is suited for you.
---
There's nothing you can get in Adventure that you can't get in Survival.
---
Git gud scrub.
---
HAHA! That's absolutely right! I never thought of it until now.
---
yeah i gotta be honest this is getting extremely frustrating. have they even acknowledged it?? im starting to think they dont see it as a problem.
---
1\* armor goes in the chipper if it's leather, metal or wood. For trapper and robot it depends on the effect: nocturnal and junkies are straight into the chipper. Everything else is based on my mood and weight limit. Combat and marine go into the machine for cheap: generally &lt;500, maybe more. But I rotate my stash ~daily and if it ain't moving it gets chipped.
---
1\* weapons _if they don't suck_ can go into the machine. 1\* Furious black powder rifle? Nocturnal pickaxe? Junkies Revolver? Fuck it, they're chipped. Instigating gauss? Bloodied deathclaw? They'll get their moment in the machine for sale at 500-1,000 and if they don't move, yup, they get chipped.
---
People on PC sell top end items for 75K+ caps. Yep, you need to max out multiple characters caps to get that ultimate BE weapon.
---
what level is your gatlin build? reason i ask is if its up there 100-150+ and unless youre sitting on a ton of unspent perks might be easier to roll and run a new character to scratch the itch on a new weapon..   
---
i respec'd once from shotguns into rifles, and decided from then on id just roll a new character now have a rifle build @260ish, a melee build @130ish, and a pistol build @70ish.  
---
but to get back to your main question it also depends on which way you wanna run the handmade? rifle type semi auto, need max perception, riflemans, tank killer, tenderizer, then if you wanna get into vats and so on..  
---
or do you wanna auto it? then it falls into agility and commando perks.
---
Is there anyway to get a new veil post quest?
---
You get the plan from doing the imposter sheepsquatch event. At least that's where I got it.
---
While this is a particularly useful mechanic it is not unique to horde events. All crown enemies behave this way. There is a loading screen tool-tip in-game that explains their behavior.
---
That's what marsupial is for.
---
Ohhhh. That explains that.
---
Junk and No. People in survival tend to carry less junk.
---
Okay... it's good to get some confirmation that putting up low cost items for newbies isn't too naive. I sell the chem station and tinker bench for 10 caps, too, so new players can get their camp going. In fairness it's only happened a couple times, most people respect the sign, but it sucks when it happens because I like to fix the weapons up with a true stock and decent scope before selling. If I knew high level players couldn't wipe out my inventory I'd like to sell items for even less.
---
[oh dear](https://coubsecure-s.akamaihd.net/get/b177/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/bb6ecf61fd9/b2db9b7c189042e3c1f71/big_1502113920_image.jpg)
---
I want to have a fair fight. I dont enjoy the pvp restrictions in adventure. I mean the explosive weapons bug is just that a bug. But it keeps coming back after they fix it.
---
I‚Äôve done that event a couple of times and I haven‚Äôt seen it.
---
37 on the character I'm experiencing the glitch with.
---
The plan is dropped randomly as part of the Encryptid event, so you could watch for that to come up and hope to get it there.
---
You can also buy the plan from player vendors, and I've seen a few offering them for anywhere from 750-1500 (though I'm sure you could find it lower).
---
They're not terribly expensive to make.  I won't be on for a long while or I'd help you out myself.
---
Thanks for the idea, did just that. It is technically like a bait and switch. lmao
---
I disagree on many things here once you got past "where to sell" and got into "what to sell". Below is what works well for me, based on the goal of making caps but not wanting to shuffle caps off to an alt because what the hell do I need all these caps for?
---
* One star Legendaries: Sure, nobody cares about a \* Junkies 10mm, but a \*Bloodied or \*Unyeilding or \*Explosive will sell if you price reasonably. I sell one-stars around 250 caps, and they sell. Particularly good combos (instigating hunting rifle) might be 500 caps. Enough to prevent "lol scrap it", not so much as to bankrupt a relatively new max level.
---
* Ammo: 1 cap each and sell whatever spare you pick up. The world is awash with ammo, and it weighs very little. That 900 .308 I sell for 1 cap each is still 900 caps. I could price it at 2 caps and wait for someone to buy, or I could just keep churning it out. I make an exception for things with high craft requirements and things like Plas/Fusion cores, but for the most part, if I can pick it up off a scorched/supermutant, it's 1 cap.
---
* I don't bother posting treasure maps. I can't imagine paying more than 10 caps for one, and generally just use them and sell any plans I get but don't want. But that one's just me, I've seen treasure maps around the price you mentioned here and there, so there much be a reason.
---
* Drugs, I rarely go over 5 caps. Like ammo, there is generally a lot of them out and about. Non-bulk Junk sells for 1 cap each, 2 caps if it's something like gears or springs, and 3 caps for screws. I could and have made more on the screws, but shit, spread the wealth, not like I'm not already swimming in caps.
---
Outside of that, an addition to location: Don't lock bloody water purifiers. Just.. why? You can't possibly use it all, and a free drink for fast traveling merchants on the go is a nice touch. To be honest, there is little reason to lock anything at all.
---
I never really understood the distinction. Like.. if a prime gatling laser uses ultracite fusion cores... doesn't that make it an ultracite gatling laser? But no, that makes it a Prime gatling laser, and an ultracite gatling laser is a whole different thing.
---
need a lil more of an idea of what you are wanting to do really.. vats? sneak? semi or full auto?
---
There is no explosive weapons bug.   And if you are in power armor you‚Äôre dead meat on Survival.
---
[This is my sniper build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f246fb&amp;d=sg2pd2pk2pp2pe2pl2eo1c72ib0ic4ar2an2ao0a04a30a51lr2l71lu2lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=).  I have an AA/E handmade with a dot sight for rapid target acquisition and close quarters, and an instigating/+10% aim damage hunting rifle for picking off distant enemies.
---
Oh okay, thanks for that. I don‚Äôt know too much about the mechanics of the events cause I don‚Äôt get on as often as I‚Äôd like, but it‚Äôs interesting to know.
---
I‚Äôve never managed to keep all 3 alive though, even when players split off.
---
That's not exactly true. If you use vats and can sneak, furious or bloodied weapons (even just 1*) can be very effective. While explosive weapons are incredibly valuble and powerful in this game, there's ways to beat people with them.
---
How about we stop making quality of life and aesthetic requests, or requests to change non-broken core game mechanics that have been in since fo3 while were at it? I would like to request that the mods do away with the suggestions all together tbh im sick of seeing the feed crowded with people asking for the most nonsensical shit 30+ times a day. Have these conversations with your cat, or a wall, cause the dev team has enough shit to do.
---
Yes, just for me. Im special. Todd is my uncle...
---
I thought something was wrong too but for me nothing showed up because i stopped tracking the quest.
---
I have a friend who showed me how you could attack bloody builds with a v fast weapon to proc their explosion mutations before they can respond effectively. It doesn't cost them caps but they will die from it and drop their junk. He does it to me all the time because he knows I don't carry junk
---
I guess I‚Äôll hop around the vendors in the world I‚Äôm in and see if anyone is selling it. If not, I might server hop and see if I get lucky.
---
She does. You can search this very sub for EKZ‚Äôs writeup or his YouTube videos of how many rounds each member of his 4 man team uses when it‚Äôs just the 4 of them, vs how many rounds it takes when it‚Äôs 20+ people. 
---
You‚Äôre probably referring to a post made back in early April where someone claimed they datamined the SBQ data and she had no scaling, but his data was client side only, and it is believed that either her health or DR% scales server side based on how many people enter the event. 
---
There are too many videos showing groups back to back server hopping farming her using the exact same gear and weapons for the myth that she doesn‚Äôt scale to be perpetuated.
---
This is why I get the event to about 95% with music, then protect the jukebox for the last bit, because that way you're not stuck in that fucking moronically long exit animation while everyone else gets the kill. 
---
Another tip for the peanut gallery, usually within a zone, people on a team get credit if one person on that team gets a kill, so if someone playing music sends you a team request, accept it, or your an asshole.
---
I see.  Of course you're right, RLS would become "THE" way to grind XP unless they also disabled the forced enemy respawning.  I'm sure they already know they can't implement RLS otherwise. 
---
 It's not just about the balance of XP, though - relogging/server hopping can cause the horrific server lag you've probably seen. 
---
Every time you relog, your server has to load your CAMP along with your player inventory into its RAM. That's why so much server latency vanished on the day the hard carry weight cap was implemented. It takes several minutes to roll loot on a dead queen when the system's tasks are backlogged due to half a dozen mules constantly loading in with millions of items that have to be processed and stored in memory.  Since it's confirmed that they're planning on introducing RLS, this must be the precise reason why they're also planning to make our CAMPs persist on the server when we log off.
---
IRL is like that. People sell crap all the time. Many make smart decisions before buying and many don't. To expect a market to be fair to all is useless and unreal.  
---
I did get into it for about an hour and I saw so many problems with it.

This is kind of what I use, it's a bloodied fully auto build. I use bols/sent on 4 pieces and one piece chameleon. It's a stealth build(obvi lol) let me know if u have any questions.
---
The dev team has asked for suggestions, they would like to improve the game with people who play the games ideas
---
As the saying goes. Others will take advantage of a situation when they can. It's become apparent that there will always be someone out there to cause issues
---
How did you get the magazine one done? I know I've read more than 20 mags and that's the only trophy I need to get the platinum one.
---
you mean like literally every last person that's posted a BeThEsDa PleAsE post?
---
I don‚Äôt even get a prompt to show up once it‚Äôs called in. 
---
Maybe the cargobots all have been destroyed.
---
A nice gesture, but I agree with the others. If I didn't mean for you to take my crops, I would have found a way to put them behind a lock or at least put up a sign with lettering saying so.
---
Collect everything you find, start sorting through to figure out what you need and don't need. The forest showers you with ammo, stimpaks, nuka-cherries, canned dog food, grenades, etc.
---
Do every event you see near you. Most of the time, you will still end up making a profit even if you fast travel to it (events tend to give at least 25 caps for completing it). They will also give you a huge stockpile of stimpaks, plans, and purified water. 
---
With player vending, you can also do what none of us got to do starting out and experiment selling to players. At your level, any gear you find won't really be helpful to 99% of the playerbase. Go for chems, ammo, and plans you already know.
---
This. All I see is BETHESDA DO THIS. I'm just excited for the the future and I love this game.
---
I saw this during the event, I could have swore it said "Formula Q" restores some of the animals. Was curious if it was a quest reward or a recipe that can be found in the area.
---
I have a bloodied. 50 cal if I get real lucky I can kill them as they kill me. The point I made is still relevant tho. Even against bloodied, explosive is a huge advantage.
---
Tbh I was more impressed they sat there and made specific breaking animations for a nuke, it wasn't like when a wall breaks and the pieces kinda just drop, it was a full on blast
---
That's what I meant to say after just doing the event
---
I can make you one later if you‚Äôd like, no charge.
---
I don't doubt it. I'm saying here that it would be pure conjecture to claim they're doing it because they got stomped in survival, or that they represent survival players at all.
---
Yes there is if you don't want to acknowledge the game as it is then just stop commenting.
---
Hmmm... well, guess I tested it correctly then.
---
I just recently made a post on what effects players enjoy and I'm going to compile a list soon. But you are also giving me some insight. Thanks for sharing.
---
I've accidentally 1-shot the legendary there before, because it sometimes spawns at a level 16ish...and my weakest gun can one shot a level 16 legendary. I've taken to carrying a non-legendary pistol for that event because of this, but a lot of people don't think about it.
---
Well, " save the day" was really "one shot the boss." Can I blame him for that?
---
It also happens when you turn off the computer to the other robot
---
The vast majority of people with explosive weapons arent "lucky" but rather bought them off the market subs or Ebay.  Without fail every single reddit profile claiming to have "grinded hard for my gear" has a post history showing they are active in the market subs, or it's a brand new account.  
---
Also, before the major deletion of duped items I was having 3-5people per weekend PMing me through xbox offering various explosive guns for a few thousand caps apiece.  Explosive guns used to be *very* easily obtained.
---
Well I guess that's your daily routine in the game than. But to be honest. That makes no sense. You sell serums for a lower price just to keep your daily runs alive all for caps you can't really invest. But hey it's a game. Everyone finds the stuff he enjoys. You enjoy that and that's great :)
---
Absolutely brilliant. Well done guys.
---
One hit on the queen doesn't get you anything but a couple ammo.
---
Hmm I explored the area once but didn't notice that. I did get access to the lower level but didn't find anything noteworthy.
---
&gt;Are you one of those players who can't survive in survival so you try to bait people in adventure and still lose?
---
No I don't engage in PVP, I'm rubbish at it, ign 'icebearhugo61' you will never see me engage with other players, I can't think fast enough and hate the whole ethos and feel of fighting other players, PVE is what I enjoy. I've never logged into survival yet, I might do eventually.
---
I do feel you with regards to these 1HK explosive two shot players but I suppose really, they did pay for the game so they should be allowed some expectation of playing how they want within the game's mechanics. If BGS decide to balance events all well and good.
---
I heard it was glitched (go figure, right?). Luckily it popped for me and my wife on our original characters. 
---
The only solution I was aware of to fix it is to read the magazines on a second character, which is super annoying to transfer a bunch of mags over.
---
same here :(
---
What is your in game name so I can add you for whenever you‚Äôre on?
---
I think the truly mentally ill thing is promoting Battlefield in a Fallout foum.
---
There's a code 790730 for the door to go underground
---
That's new to me, no idea.
---
\^Until the patch that made it nearly impossible to one-shot certain people, I would have agreed with everything you said there. But when I run a build with a Bloodied Dragon, Nerd Rage, all the rifleman perk cards, Concentrated fire for headshots, all the relevant mutations like Eagle Eyes and Adrenal, am sneaking and running Covert Operative, Better Criticals, and I'm down at 10% health with a crit saved up and headshot crit someone and it doesn't kill them....Come on. Then your opponent is just going to stim back to full health, turn around and blow your glass cannon build apart. Nobody should survive a base damage of over 1,200 plus a sneak multiplier, headshot multiplier, Covert Operative and Better Criticals. But they do, it's completely stupid, and why anyone who isn't losing their shirt dying in PVP runs only certain armor sets with explosive handmades/decent explosive automatics to beat the damage limiter, legacy explosive energy weapons, and until the fix a week ago, explosive shotguns.  
---
That shouldn't happen, but it does because of that IDIOTIC one-shot limiter Bethesda put in the game a few patches back. And it turned people off to PVP.
---
I've run it more times than I can count and I haven't received one either.  Or the non-mascot outfit, for that matter.  Seems a bit rare.
---
Is formula p the item uses during the event to heal the animals?
---
'can get' is a bogus standard. I can get a lot of steel mining ore, but I won't.
---
I've been selling full fusion cores for 55 caps (in my experiece the lowest I've seen them go for) since player vendors dropped and only just sold some today. I was surprised to see that they of all things were one of the most sold items.
---
&gt;"Ozymandias" is the title of two poems published in 1818. English Romantic poet Percy **Bysshe** Shelley wrote a sonnet, first published in the 11 January 1818 issue of The Examiner in London.  
---
I like the way they connect everything in Fallout, these little easter eggs are quite good
---
How does stock piling serums make any sense lol. To each their own I guess.
---
If you assist in any way you deserve a piece of the pie. Not the crumbs.
---
It's like saying everyone who is in the military as support doesn't deserve a good reward for their hard work. If you help with the mission you deserve something from it.
---
I'm a soldier and support. My job is to do commo operations and it's my job to make sure the mission has communications. If I'm not there, then the mission can't be done. Everyone is an important piece of the puzzle.
---
Eh.  I try to play the game in a somewhat immersive way.  "Changing bodies so I can hoard stuff" doesn't really fly with my mentality in a game.
---
But even if I did do that, to what end?  It won't give me a bigger camp budget.  It won't let me respec my character on a whim so I can go from a Heavy Guns build to a Melee build to a Rifle build, just because I have all these great weapons across different mules.  It doesn't really solve anything except let you hoard stuff that it's difficult to use.
---
Grafton Monster is an alien. There are 4 static spawns of them I can think of.
---
1. Outside of Charleston Capitol Building in the water.
---
2. Out near the Public Workshop with the three acid extractors
---
3. Next to the power plant across from the train rail yard.
---
4. The grafton monster event in grafton (when the event is up)
---
Sorry I am not ingame atm to pull up the actual names of the locations.
---
All I'm saying is if you pretty much only pvp in adventure you probably aren't very good and are hiding in adventure because like any logical person could see you just can't cut it
---
Everyone get on this before Bethesda "patches" it
---
I shall try that, never crossed my mind to be honest, I'm a silly goose. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I think the formula P is the chem the event gives the friendly animals. I have seen something pop up as notification between rounds but idk what that was that healed them.
---
Yeah  didn't think of that when I posted. I'm sure alot alot alot of people bought their explosives from duppers which makes their huge advantage even more unfair and just straight up kills the enjoyment I get from the game. Come to think of it I was just getting one shorted by somone who was half my level just yesterday. I'd bet money that guy probably paid for that gun.
---
https://youtu.be/qRBbMKa6Aac this video covers the horde farming and one silent night farming. From the earlier post as well
---
Yep
---
I have the perk and always get hearts and livers. 
---
Strange.
---
It would be pretty tough given the way the game is currently built.  None of the assets are streamed live (that I'm aware of anyway), so they'd have to change the way some assets work, and you'd have to be able to download things like that on the fly.
---
Then you'd have to worry about security - depending on the system and a few other things, I can replace a file in my photos directory with anything, the game would have to be able to somehow verify that I wasn't uploading something nefarious.  Also, though this is an M rated game, I could also replace some of those screenshots with...well, use your imagination.  I know other people would :P
---
Technically it's doable, maybe with a lot of work, but it's possible.
---
I have plenty of builds, and i'd rather my already nerfed glass cannon not be ruined by little whiny kids like you.
---
No but I've played since beta and it's the same thing over and over and over and over again. Just wait the next big thing will be vampire and junkie especially if they Nerf bloody builds.
---
Ign lazarus801
---
I hate players who one shot or one hit kill. They get away with so much.
---
If you're talking about a one button filter for the Aid tab, this may be something that they can do. If you're talking about adding more tabs, that ain't gonna happen.
---
Ahhhhh okay. Yeah that makes sense lol. Thank you!
---
Yeah I thought it said Formula Q healed the animals. Only seen it during one event and it popped a couple times. Curious if it's a quest reward or a secret found in the area.
---
Apparently nuke zones now count as rad storms for the sake of challenges.
---
Be on later tonight
---
If you go a little bit south of the chem plant then follow the stream uphill there's a massive tree with a waterfall you can build on. Heres mine from back in the day.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/C7x4Z2y
---
i remember being in grafton or somewhere in the north with a vendor both and he told me that the overseer had gone through there before
---
Have you tested this?
---
Yeah the Lasers are weird.
---
You have:
---
* Gatling Laser (Base model)
---
* Prime Gatling Laser (With Prime Gatling Laser Receiver mod)
---
* Ultracite Gatling Laser (Completely different weapon)
---
* Prime Ultracite Gatling Laser (With Prime **Ultracite** Gatling Laser Receiver mod. It's a completely different mod from above)
---
Cabinets are in fo4.
---
The videos, yeah I can see how that would be an issue.
---
At least a couple of rotating freeze frames on the screen!
---
Junk and No. Survival players tend to carry less junk.
---
The point is there are options to negate having to buy the items from the atom shop. You choose not to swap out a perk to cannibal when you need to eat and then swap back when done. Thats why these things are convenience items, not game changers
---
I've gotten one. Have done two successfully there. Didn't know you could get multiple medals.
---
But I also think that survival characters should be only playable on survival.  No jumping back and forth. So people cant jump in adventure to stock up then jump back. I think the people that start from level 1 and stay in survival are playing how it should be played in my opinion
---
Mothman egg omelets junk and weapons.
---
Any time I can buy the junk i need to craft serums at 1c each,  that's a huge win for me
---
Everything makes sense but the mutton pie recipe. Everyone and their grandma is selling stacks of these things for 10 caps, of course... but who‚Äôs buying them? Enough that it beats disease cures and screws? Truly baffling.
---
Also bought a smores recipe for 10 caps today. Wooo
---
I didn't asked for nerf. I think damage is fine. The problem is that range is unlimited, which does not have any difference on first 200 meters (or whatever the unit is). The suggested change would only impact PvP at distances which usually don't even load on consoles. Hardly a nerf.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Turning tricks behind the Overseers camp.
---
To anyone complaining abot Atom system: It's FREE if you are willing to try, QUIET UP. And to those that think Repair kits and things like Fridges unbalance the game or are a money grab, your only about 1/3 right, they are a money grab, aslong as ur stupid/lazy enuff to do so. They however do NOTHING to even alter the overall game play,  you can get repair kits for free doing SBQ and food is literally everywhere, if you can't find any, you really aren't looking.
---
...well, that puts paid to one of my pet gripes. I've been actively angry at people selling garbage recipes like mutton meat pie, given the fact that it drops consistently from the only animal that \_gives you mutton\_ but apparently..uh.. people are lazy?
---
I haven't been watching the TTK lately, but I'm not getting any of those 15min+ slugfests since going bloodied. Bloodied shotguns probably doesn't compare to a good 50cal on dpm, but at least you can cripple the SBQ fast.
---
I'm not sure what explosive actually does on shotguns, either before or after the nerf, but the combat shotgun is strongly fire-rate limited in an SBQ fight so 25% FR + reload sounds like a god roll to me.
---
I think build has a lot to do with it too. There's a lot of things that are situational. I will agree that explosive weapons have a big advantage. Hell I have a few of them myself. They aren't my go to, but I have them for real tanky fights like the queen or imposter SS. But the build does matter. Can't get double or triple damage sneak shots and crits as a heavy gunner. I hope you don't take anything I say as critical of you, just trying to offer help.
---
Yeah maybe. Or might be a criteria has to be met? That's something we should investigate. Because they need to be healed between events lol
---
The fun of it
---
Yo don't need 100 mules to spread your caps than. It's just more practicable to hold them like that..
---
Can we add a keychain as well for the MISC tab? :)
---
bullshit, if stan lee could fit the hulk in the batmobile you can!
---
I think what happens here is that the green goo pile gets stuck in the air. It's technically there, but since it only has a texture on the top you can't see it from the ground. If you were able to get to a higher vantage point you might be able to find it.
---
Okay. I‚Äôll most likely still be on.
---
I always go out of my way to use my automatic tesla to tag everything without killing it.  And I cripple legs with my shotguns.  All this so I can share loot, whether I'm on team or not.
---
But if someone isn't sharing in kind, I'm not above clearing the Golf Clubhouse with my ghoul slaying +power attack war drum, just to make it a sad day for a selfish person.
---
And it's far too often that folks aren't interested in sharing.  I'm seeing this too much at both the White Spring and the prime site.  We *all* get stable flux components if we all take a hit--share the love, folks!  RNG means we might do best if we increase our odds and trade for bits we need later!
---
While I honestly haven't been touched by the OHKO nerf as my high damage output weapons tend to be multi-projectile and or high-RoF, I agree it became limiting for certain builds and its not like those builds dominated in first place.
---
But I can make them whenever I want. Why would I store them I guess.
---
Those are good points. I have seen players in this area, though they typically fell into my generalization about camps in the mire and bog. 
---
I tend to view vending camps like car dealerships. Its better if you are near other dealers because the barriers to people coming to your shop go way down when they can travel cheaply or free. Additionally, if you have a low amount of stock, those larger shops bring people in to the area and then they stop by your shop as well.
---
 havent had an organic three star drop since the update. havent seen more than one or two 1 star legendaries at west tec.  on the other end of the spectrum there is tales of "legendary servers" where almost every area is dripping with legendaries. seems to only happen to content creators on youtube though lol.
---
But I get what you're saying now. Just took me a minute to get there lol
---
Bought 10 Marsupial serums for 1000 CAPS
---
I try to keep some weapons in stock to entice people, just make sure they arent ALL junk. You can hold some back by pricing a little high, then when you get new stock lower prices if it hasn't sold.
---
Things that sell well: Disease cures, Ultracite Scrap, black titanium, Springs ans screws, magazines , treasure maps, bloody, 2 shot, and furious weapons, rare clothing types, plans, balistic fiber (obvioisly).
---
Think like a low level player. What did you need? i.e. springs for excavator PA.
---
At high levels, the things you naturlly accumulate large numbers of...so do all the other people with a lot of caps (higher levels). Junk amd Stims probably need to be priced fairly low, the game throws them at you left and right.
---
P.S. anyone know why addictol didn't sell? It's a rarer med and pretty useful for chem heads. Do people just not use many chems?
---
Maybe Bethesda rigged the game from the start..
---
Especially if you're unlucky enough to get Hamlet the Tick lol
---
Omg...preach! Better yet they take legendaries away from PVP servers so nobody can whine.  Skill vs. Skill.
---
No I haven‚Äôt but it is only a recent change, since patch 9. Also way easier to launch a nuke than finding a radstorm even in survival
---
Many reload sand hard resets on the xbox one x
---
I fair fight is more fun, I agree. I don't steal for the fun of it. For me it's been the most efficient way to get materials aside from just buying them.
---
Sort by weight. All ore and gunpowder go to the top!
---
Put a bloodied swing speed +1 str baseball bat on sale for 8k. Bought up immediately. Apparently any 2h melee weapon with those three attributes is worth like 20k. Can't recall any amazing deals I've gotten though.
---
Yes... this.
---
I have the hoarding disease ...  if even a single bottle / can / burnt book / or other piece of junk remains in a location ... I feel bad for not respecting the work and effort of the creators as they designed a location 
---
Found I was spending too much time deciding what to keep.  So... bought a second copy of the game on sale.  Now I have specialized characters for junk, aid, legendaries, ammo and stuff with ‚Äúemotional attachment‚Äù.
---
The most worthwhile investment I made :) - no anguish, always enough of everything for any situation and more time to play
---
I'll do it with you, add PrimordialPear
---
I‚Äôm not promoting it? I‚Äôm clarifying lies
---
Serendipity and nerd rage are essentials for a bloodied build
---
Sure.. I was wondering where to focus my efforts in the challenges. If I‚Äôm going to grind anything out, I‚Äôd rather look at the possum challenges.  Now that I have the plans I can passively complete the tadpole quests. Thanks for the clarification!
---
If you think Explosive is broken just wait until you come across people running Quad Tesla's that all they have to do is shoot at their feet and the arching damage will kill you in like 3-4 hits.
---
PvP is completely borked right now.
---
My this changes things for the Leader of the Pack events :) 1\* wood armor for everybody!
---
Yeah..now to find someone who can launch a nuke in survival. My survival character can't. Hrm..maybe if I find a camera on my normal character
---
could be lol, although when it comes to rng in games i have literally the worst luck. so i tend to just think fml rather than conspiracy.
---
You can craft a new one but I don‚Äôt remember where I found the plans. I know that doesn‚Äôt really help but it is possible.
---
Those people probably set their stuff up poorly. I have NEVER had to defend my base from anything, including scorchbeasts, after properly setting up my turrets. Line of sight and redundant lanes of fire are important. Spotlights help out turret range immensely. 
---
People are free to drag whatever the hell they want to my camp. It'll all die, while I keep playing Grognak on my pipboy.
---
Hey man are you on PC? If so drop me a friend request and we can do some questing together :)
---
Good thing is if your computer is good enough you can run 2 accounts in the single pc and just alt+tab lol which is what i do.
---
Let‚Äôs address the real issues. We need distress/signal flares.
---
I bought atom shop skins for my used power armor. That way, the tagged armor is the stuff I keep, and the rest is the stuff I accidentally entered at a SBQ or when trying to take a fusion core and can safely be dropped without crying over hours of grinding for parts.
---
Well, you want to sell your items and the higher ticketed ones don't get purchased all that often. But there should be something in place where if it does sell you don't get screwed out of your money due to an artificial cap limit.
---
I'll have to try it out. Gotta find someone who can drop a nuke in survival or grab a camera on my normal character.
---
Not quite the same level, but I cleared everything else in Wendigo cave, and then had some douche come run in and kill the Wendigo before I could, for the daily atoms the other day.
---
I'm a Tesla tagger!  In fact, I can craft them, and if anybody wants a tesla just for that, I'm happy to craft them (provided we've all got the components).  S/n bodhisattvah, and I camp the junk pile south of the WS.
---
Will do
---
Honestly same, although I do think it's interesting in the different drop rates in people's accounts something tells me theres me to it.
---
this reminds me a complaint of a guy that wrote paragraphs saying that using the dev room was his right since he bought the game and doesn't deserve a ban lol
---
Personally I would take nerd rage for sure however my biggest change would be your strength stat I would just leave it at 1 or 2 and raise the perception up too atleast 13 so I can take all the rifle cards to get the most damage as well as tank killer and atleast 1 point of concentrated fire.
---
I just used one today.  It went fine.
---
Yeah, I have that bug too. I killed one with a syringer for another category challenge and it completed, but oddly all that shooting with a syringer never registered for the one you're talking about for me.
---
Hope they fix it soon. You aren't alone
---
Exactly :)
---
Drops have always been shit, I don't even understand why their are 2 and 3 star enemies if they only ever drop 1 star items.
---
Can't tell you how many times I've killed 3 star Sheepsquatch's, the SBQ, and the Alpha's and congratulations here's your 1 star wood armor, or switch blade....
---
now i shall look for this event. but with my luck it will be more elusive than my t-51 right arm. day 7billion of my adventures, and the hunt continues.
---
I've just been doing a little each day.  If you're grinding the badges to get them done as fast as possible,  I can see how that would seem tedious and frustrating.  But the game's not going anywhere,  so why do everything at light speed? 
---
I'll check off one or two things a day and go back to what I would want to be doing.
---
^ couldn't hack it
---
quad explosive +reload shotty (pump I think) level 45 for 550 caps.
---
0.50 uses more mats, but IIRC it's still a lot cheaper to make than 5.56. It has a 180 batch size vs 36 for 5.56.
---
No, I don't if love to know of any help anyone could provide. But it's impossible to be sneaky when your location is liturally on every person's map on the server just because Ive been playing for more then 20 minutes. (I really don't like survival points if you couldn't tell before) I have 2 peices of assassins armor now and that has not done a single thing against the explosive weapons I've come up against. But I agree build has alot to do with it. If I could put perk points into explosive resistance I definitely would.
---
It worked! 
---
Thanks man! Much appreciated
---
no, unsure, as far as i know luck mostly impacts vats crits and has some of the better perks in the game. i could be wrong though
---
Plans for the suit spawn all over the place, I reccomend checking flatwoods. That's where I got mine
---
Sure you can, but I'd call you a commie!  I like to let others tag enemies, but not because I think they have a right to it. I don't blame anyone for one-shotting everything they see.  They have a right to not be pressured to "share" with random people. Just because we lived in the same vault doesn't make us all brothers and sisters.
---
Why should I have to keep tabs on this? If I put an item in a couple of weeks ago I need to monitor it due to an artificial cap limit? I'd rather be having fun playing the game than monitoring my items for sale. You start to lose out of thousands of caps from a sale and eventually you'll just take the vendor machines off line.
---
Right!!
---
Can you do me a favor?  Can you check your game folder and see if there are any .dmp files?  I'm curious to see if we're all suffering the same issue.
---
It's funny you post this. I have caught myself in real world situations where I see something and for that fraction of a second my instinct is to go over and check it for loot.
---
How many people understand this person's brilliant comment?
---
Did you have your military outfit and helmet on? If not, do that and come back to him.
---
Oh damn, explains the 3 suppressors miniguns in (almost) a row I got from the vendor on the first day.
---
Do you think you can check your game folder and see if there are any .dmp files?  I'd love to compare them to mine.
---
Yes I did. Throughout the entire thing. I completed all the courses and tests. Guess I‚Äôm just gonna have to do it all over again ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I'm not saying you did. My point is when people complain about a specific meta weapon or armor, Bethesda almost always nerfs it. Whether that's your intention or not.
---
I have an AAE laser rifle and yes it's pretty OP but like the other guy said, I don't do PVP and it's a pretty fun weapon and pretty balanced for PVE
---
Joke's on you. My toilet isn't functional and I pee in the bushes.

this is my build, vats sniper build, long distance i use an AAE lever, back up is a tse lever both scoped, run and gun i have a IE combat rifle, and then for my up close and personal send alot of lead down range i have my TSE handmade with dot sight, i can melt scorchbeasts/mirelurk queens/hermit crabs/deathclaws and the like face to face with it pretty quick. on the queen sneaked behind or to the side in caution getting dmg bonus i can see her health go down steadily, i also use the stinging magazine.
---
On the server right now.
---
Pretty sure the guy that just killed me had an explosive tesla. Idk if that's actually a thing or not but that's what it looked like the the split second I was alive.
---
Best deal as buyer? I got the high capacity backpack mod plan for 1,500. Also a lvl 50 bloodied swing speed 3* pole hook for 2,000 which was a straight upgrade to my 2* level 40 version. 
---
As seller? I try to under-price plans but I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt know which people appreciated most.
---
I have a one star auto vampiric handmade coupled with tank killer 3 and ifs a great weapon.  Bought it off a guy about 100 levels ago and it‚Äôs one weapon I use a lot in survival with pretty decent results.  With my perks it‚Äôs about 100 dmg per shot and with a 25 mag clip you can work some fools over with it.
---
Congrats! I have all but the Level 100 trophy and I'm only level 68.
---
Add TwistedFexer I'll help out
---
You bet! Glad too help... see you around  Appalachia!
---
Theres a random encounter that spawns a eyebot; he says some shit about the responders, then scans you, if you wear a responders outfit he will say some more shit, if you dont he will say the scan failed or something. I encountered this guy when farming for the hunters longcoat
---
Likely vats related equipment.
---
Nice! Will do!
---
As a buyer, dozens of lightweight, useless legendaries; walking canes, rolling pins, lead pipes etc, for 25 caps or less each. I‚Äôve been rolling them into legendary scrip daily. 
---
As a seller, I‚Äôve been cranking out legendaries for 150-600 caps each, including a lot of good stuff. A guy bought 8 pieces of 3 star armor from me for 450 each last night. Not exactly god rolls, but good rolls. 
---
I like selling stuff cheap. It‚Äôs imaginary money anyway. If it keeps me flowing with caps to buy what I want, and helps other players, I‚Äôm happy.
---
Explosive Tesla's actually suck because the explosive effect overrides the Arch and the arch damage seems to be unmitigated, meaning it can even kill your through Serendipity and your ER.
---
1&amp;2 no.
---
I'm level 102 I think. I'm thinking I'll need 15-20 more levels to correct my build. Pretty much the same xp it would take from level 0-40 to do all of this. I'm wondering if I should continue on this character or start over.
---
I believe the plasma goo piles do this also?
---
Yeah, it just depends on how much you got in the feeder. I got a yao guai which has some heft durability.
---
I had a few pieces with vats stuff and barely could hit anything.
---
So the bolt action is better? I've never really messed with them.
---
I would take that without complaint. In fact, didn't they say it would be like that after beta? I do commend people who started fresh on survival but I won't be happy if I'm required to do so. Most of the questlines don't bear repeating.
---
No they're just random badges you can use to get the plans. They're not the challenge badges but you can use them to buy the plans.
---
Does PSN have lfg or clubs?
---
I have a max lvl BE with reduced weight.
---
*takes notes* thank you for this info.
---
Well...I don't use drugs ever. I don't want it in my character if I'm not using it irl. My character is BOS and I'm a soldier IRL. We also get urine analysis.
---
Which is why fixing the bugged range wouldn't affect it. My post aint the first one about those rifles. Its just the one who instead saying "plz nerf" identified mechanic thats faulty and abused so that the gun can be brought back in line without sacrificing its PvE effectiveness anyhow. I believe it should be supported as such, hence, an alternative would be an actual nerf, which I wouldn't want.
---
It's happened to me in the past, but I was SEVERELY overencumbered.
---
What's lfg?
---
The answer is almost always time and frustration.
---
Except it is always looted by some asshole rather than any new person.
---
Well sadly, at least in the case of this game - the democratization of submitting suggestions has brought us to the point where utterly pointless QOL requests have the same weight as a bug or actual fix by virtue of upvoting or downvoting. I see multiple people daily who apparently think adding X clothing item or allowing a player to do X stupid action or changing the core UI thats existed since FO3 is just as or more important than, say, when I farm legendaries at whitespring and whole mobs of ghouls are laid down bodies floating across the ground attacking me - on which I can't get a hit marker, or invisible enemies when fast traveling to an area, or fast traveling on a team mate and being 100 yards away every fucking time!

Looking for Group.

This isn't bad

You're kidding right? I'm a level 30 that is killing level 58-60 everything easily in my level 25 power armor, INCLUDING level 150+ players that have attempted to take workshops from me. You are playing absolutely incorrectly if you are struggling to the point of death with anything other than "boss" mobs. Not saying me taking on those mobs isn't a pain in the ass, but for be 20 levels below the max, I know I can take them on and survive because I play correctly. I'm not ignoring any details, I get that it railroads players towards certain builds; however, there is no content (if properly handled) that requires you to max out your damage. Yes, SB Queen is a bitch, but lets be real here, if level 20-30 didn't show up to fight her, she'd be a lot easier. Nearly every nuke that is dropped that spawns here, I'd say a very large of the majority of player that show up to deal with her have no business being there.  
---
I've been arguing perfectly fine without bringing up the future, I'm just saying that YOU are saying that lock-picking and hacking provides nothing right now so you completely want them to change it for you and your precious 10 seconds, where if they didn't, then there are future options for it. Your argument is like saying that World of Warcraft's first patches show no evidence that the game was going to last as long as it has and that those patches provided no sense of direction where the game was going. The point you tried to argue makes no sense, lol. Just because you chose a wife that doesn't want to have a threesome doesn't mean that mine and I shouldn't or cant. You picked your wife and you're dealing with the hardships of that, just like you picked your build and perks and should deal with them. Could go out and cheat, even if it takes 10 seconds, switch it up a little bit, but I doubt you can go out and have two wives without ruining something good. 
---
And no, hardly any multiplayer games let you endlessly build your character and "multi-class". Ark's system is no where near as complex as the perk system in this game. Ark, like Rust, is a very basic survival game where (like I said before) the meta is so damn tiny that you have one, maybe two options. This game is FAR more complex and your suggestion will only bring it closer to feeling shallow like Ark or Rust. Praise the fact that we have diversity instead of trying to ruin it over 10 seconds.
---
I tend to be a little inpatient when it comes to gaming and yes youre right theres really no hurry to do them, just not my kind of thing to do while gaming.
---
I‚Äôm stay off meta with this build. Bloodied is great and all. I‚Äôm thinking explosive would be good though.
---
Disregard this as some liberal bullshit
---
I don't think it does. Once you friend someone, you automatically can join their group
---
yes on PC 
---
and using perk loadout manager
---
I absolutely would. I don't understand why Bethesda seems 100% hell bent on this leaderboard nonsense. There are so few people playing survival because of it.
---
Bloodied will most likely never be nerfed, because it, in itself, is balanced imo. The thing making it seem OP is the combination of perks and armor and mutations that synergize so well. If you were actually at risk of dying in that one shot, it would be balanced
---
Eat his liver gain his power
---
Honestly my first character when I started was a mess so I completely changed characters and deleted my old one  changing too  2 handed melee build. Now I made a new character again and am working on a bloodied stealth sniper. Imo it's better too make a new character with different builds than too try and switch everything since it takes way more lvling. I'd also recommend using the site I linked for pre planning builds as it makes it way easier and even gives you a lvling guide for how to lvl your character as you do the build.

---
If you have friends to play with then yeah it's quite fun and you can catch up but otherwise I'd say probably no
---
It's the Flatwoods Monster that is an alien, not Grafton. That is just a cryptid.
---
As far as remember luck only affects condition quality of items you loot, how quickly you obtain crits in VATs and apparently whether or not you get a pie out of that stupid machine.
---
so in conclusion ..
---
1. No
---
2. No
---
side note .. early on some one apparently found that each character at creation has some sort of seed associated with it that overall affect loot tables so I would assume anytime you make a purchase at the legendary vendor this would be used just like opening a container or a dead body.
---
I'll often leave something for lowbies. If I'm on some fuck-you-shit I'll take everything and leave em some salt.
---
By mid-December, less than a month after this game came out, defending workshops came down to getting one-shotted by people in full sent/assassin gear with TSE shotguns.  PvP is basically p2w in 76, either you buy a bunch of 3* legendary gear or get completely wrecked by someone who did.
---
I sold a imported panda for 420 caps (no joke) so i guess theres no such thing as ignorant prices
---
They said they would have resets with some kind of survival seasons.  I just think survival would be more engaging if people couldn't farm gear in adventure then jump to survival.
---
Everyone pulls their weight in some form or another.  If you can't lead in combat, lead in support!
---
I've met a few trying to goad me into pvp by trying to jump in front of my firing arc, but Adventure Mode seems to have largely put a stop to it.  With the forcing people to use survival for many challenges, I suspect trolling will rise back up.
---
Agreed, I've had quite a few times where I've been running low on ammo and someone has been kind enough to list a bulk load of ammo for free, really helped me out a few times :)
---
Yeah that what happened to me, had to go quests misc and start tracking supply drop again
---
I've got an anti armour explosive one if you're interested but it's a two star
---
People keep fucking turning up and killing the horde boss and I get nothing. All that spawns in is low levels and then someone comes and one hits the boss. I‚Äôll keep trying I guess.....
---
I got lucky and snagged one during last weeks fuss, I traded another legacy laser (mutant explosive) and 15k caps for mine. It took daily posts for three days straight on the market to finally secure a deal.
---
There's more events to do but their kinda hard solo. I recommend you do the leader of the pack event which is around the top let corner of the map. Gives you a legendary per alpha killed (there are 3)
---
Try Wavy Willards, I just stayed there and hopped till I got lucky.
---
Honestly, I had no idea people were paying so much for watered down legendaries.  I get bloodied or BE as it is the new TSE.  Furious and instigating depending on the weapon.  Hunting rifles have become very much in vogue and decent Gauss rifles are always marketable.
---
I give you an opportunity to embark on an epic quest to scour the wasteland's dusty grills and soggy campfires, to find a rare, and **highly** elusive hotdog? And you turn it down???
---
*sigh*
---
I was kind of enamored of the idea. I won't be on until later tonight, but if you haven't found anyone else, you can hit me up. Gt is same as ID.
---
What are you looking for it?
---
You could buy one of those guns just like everyone else. Also levels don‚Äôt mean anything after level 50. Build matters more than weapons (although they have a large role)
---
could it be anywhere at wavy Willard's or just in the parking lot because that's where I've heard it being.
---
you can remove the games you do not own on the launcher one at a time, its what i did
---
I enjoyed the survey. Hopefully it can help in some way to make this game I enjoy better.
---
Weapon weights - besides the surprisingly long lasting buildings - is by biggest gripe with most Fallout games. Like slight modifications to a weapon should change a few grams at most. A regular rifle should be something around \~6-9lbs, or \~3-5kg. This is nuts.
---
I honestly couldn't agree more it's more of a battle royal at white spring then survival or you're getting attacked at your base because you have a neon target on your back with your exact location
---
Giant Tea Pot, a sure one.
---
Exactly. Bloodied and AA anything is sellable. Instigating on sniping weapons and slow hard hitters. Furious and vampire on anything fast shooting / hitting. That is basIcally it for 1* effects
---
I only want to fast travel rn because I hate server-hopping Everytime someone nukes my location. Maybe just allow fast travel while inside a blast zone.
---
What i still dont understand though is why Bisshe faked a sheepsquatch.
---
Put them into a vending machine for 25k caps each, they'll be protected.
---
Well, post apocalypse.
---
I got mine on the first try at the Mothman sculpture in Point Pleasant.
---
First thing is what Platform are you on?
---
I thought that bug got fixed
---
Oh yeah. Xbox
---
Me too!
---
Thanks glad you found it ok. That's what I'm hoping for, had a lot of responses so far but aiming to get over the 500 mark at least. Will be over the moon if we hit triple digits!
---
If you access the terminal in there during the feeding trough segment of the event, you‚Äôll find a shut down code. You then go back to the main computer and shut down the experiment. 
---
An obnoxiously lovable Mr. Handy takes over the experiment and gives the friendly animals his Formula Q‚Äîwhich helps them defend themselves and lets them regenerate health between waves. 
---
It‚Äôs an extremely beneficial step.
---
Dunno, he was doing it last night
---
When you load in move forward into the parking lot, if the tourist has spawned there it will be leaning on the car on your right.
---
If you could hack it in Survival, you wouldn't need to come to adventure. Instead you're epeen crying about it on r/
---
I dont disagree its broken, I think bugs should, in an ideal world, be submitted strait to bethesda via their site so that they definately get seen, although a lot of people do not ever submit a ticket they just complain on here, reddit is a better place for the lesser requests like  opinions on QOL changes, feature requests, new clothing/item/weapons requests ect...  
---
maybe find out if other are experiencing a bug the same as you or to bring it to light if you get no response from bethesda on a ticket and its an actual game breaking bug.  
---
If everyone used the appropriate flairs and the filtering system was just a little better, people who didnt want to see certain things here could simply filter them out and it would be fine, although that requires co-operation by everyone to make it work properly
---
sold a BE lmg for 400c. thought that was fair
---
Well theres still no elves .. but you can have a harem as our female population has been increasing at an alarming rate, bring plenty of baby powder and keychains
---
It took me a very long time to get to 50, but shortly after I learned what was actually efficient and I bet I could get to level 50 in a couple of weeks.
---
I think we will be able to join a faction and have a quest line with said faction.
---
C'mon,  useless ad they may be, I treasure my ass backwards items, like my +40% swing speed +10% dmg if mutated +1 End Shovel. I wouldn't mind an Instigating TSE flare gun.
---
Because for some really dumb reason we can't trade or drop ones we find. If we could I would make sure everybody I meet had one.
---
or that mothman wing. damn thing keeps flying away.  I am one off from so many badges I can't complete for reasons like extreme rare rng and it's pretty obnoxious.
---
So does Free Range.  Nobody seems to play it anymore.
---
Both bolt-action and revolver can use pistol and rifle perks if equiped with a rifle stock. Bolt action is heavier hitting but fire rate and reload speed are bad. Revolver is better mid to close range because it has nice damage but has a better fire rate.
---
On he acid bearing lake right next to you.  Good area for customer traffic, I sometimes have to try 3 or 4 servers to get my camp down.
---
  As for sales, 45, 556, and shotgun shells @1cp. Rare apperel, serums600cp, quest drop plan and recipes, some armor mods (marine). Quest items, sell all the royal jelly I put up(the right type to cook), cheap railway or crossbows, or flamers(too heavy). Bobbleheads...
---
Yeah. I can also. But you mostly never pay more than 25k for anything. Mostly people will trade above that. So I got 2x 25k and the rest is in mutations i can trade when i need money. Of course there is a cap to 1400 a day but well who cares. ;)
---
I killed a lvl 12  boss rad scorpion and got lvl 5 tse 90% weight reduce pump action shotgun üíîüíî
---
Due to insanely overwhelming player requests, in patch 9 they made every item/creature/building/location the same shade of black. 
---
So FO76 is now like playing a text based game, only without the noob crutch of having text. Just a player screaming, scorchbeast screaming, ghoul screaming, blackout death orgy, as you try to sprint from unseen event, to unseen location. I'm pretty sure they, like, quadrupled the number of fissures, because I have spent the last 25+ hours of gameplay doing nothing but falling into one. 
---
The best part is not really knowing if you actually still have your weapon equipped, if you still have any ammo, or if you still even have clothes on. I do have to say it's made survival mode really stand out (or at least I think it has? I don't really know which one I'm in anymore).
---
Anyway, if that sounds like fun, you should join our mime and shadow puppet role playing group. We meet every Tuesday at the nearest fissure, or at least everyone says that's where we meet, I haven't been able to confirm.
---
It just feels right!
---
Truth
---
is this event the one where you have to defend the animals from waves?
---
You can get all of those models for free at the frat house lol
---
I can sell it for 6k caps
---
Compared to what? For heavy and the queen i use my bloodied minigun with ultracite ammo. 
---
For one shooting mobs. Not too bad. I'm a fan. I haven't used it that much tbh. 
---
I'm only a rifleman build / heavy weapons / unarmed / 2h melee.
---
So no commando weapons for me.
---
Just got into the bloodied build like a week or two ago. lvl 128 at 250hr.
---
Im down, I need ppl who know what theyre and can keep all three alive. Psn: BirdJP19
---
I can let you know about that price once I get online.
---
Yep I'm picking up what you're selling now. I can't ever get rid of these damn caps. I've got 3 characters full and my main is around 23k now and nothing to spend it on lol
---
Sad but true
---
For those who are stopping by: The tone really starts at 1:43
---
Thank you for the tag! I've been reading over the responses in here as the day has been going on. I've recorded a lot of the feedback here and I'm passing that along.
---
Hiding behind me helps lol
---
Let's see, checking my stash, of these I have the following in stock...
---
Item | Number in Stock | Price per Unit
---
-----|:---------------:|:----:
---
Fusion Core | 10 | 79
---
Shotgun Shell | 272 | 2
---
Stimpak | 100 | 19
---
5.56 Ammo | 1,000 | 1
---
.45 Ammo | 47 | 1
---
Marsupial Serum | 3 | 499
---
.308 Ammo | 1,000 | 2
---
Disease Cure | 30 | 10
---
Would be really nice if they also published what each of these are going for.
---
What level is your main character?
---
I'm gonna take you up on that.
---
Interesting... I wonder if this is the ‚Äúprestige‚Äù system tied to becoming an overseer?
---
I'd actually love if the just gave us legendary drills and syringers
---
Oh wow, that really does suck, I've not had that happen to me yet and hope I don't! Way too much effort and ammo for nothing...

Main is 210? And this build is 30-something
---
See I spend my caps in cheap serums and trade them back if i really need them ;) Also i won around 150-250 caps each than :)
---
I don't know which one to choose I've been to so many already!
---
I commented in a few other threads on this, but popping in here as well to say I've passed that feedback along.

Check every red toolchest you pas as well, I keep seeing them as loot in the small and big red tool,chests around the wasteland

 &gt; I commented in a few other threads on this, but popping in here as well to say I've passed that feedback along.
---
PC, thanks for the offer though!
---
Yup
---
Ah ok so around my play time I tend to lower my prices when it's new players since they need to fast travel and such
---
Having a visible leader board would be good still, if it didn't also pinpoint the top 3 players on the map.
---
Ah. Good policy.
---
I‚Äôve not had any errors during transactions, no.
---
Yes you can wear hats with the plague doctor mask.
---
Since it launched I had the chance to jump into the event. I would have liked to do it from the very start and get the full experience, regardless. I jumped in around half way through the 2 times I got to join.  
---
I would love a server wide notification for anyone that starts it, or a countdown to when it starts like when people launch nukes. A little 5m timer with whoever jumps on the speaker and says they're getting things ready so more players can join. Cause it is a great event and one that does require a fair amount of ppl to complete.  
---
lol xD just my thoughts
---
The Flatwoods monster is seperate to the Alien in the challenges. There is a Cryptid Challenge that requires killing both a Flatwoods monster and an Alien, listed separately.
---
#Cough#Moron#Cough#
---
AMEN.....
---
so it has a specific spot at each location, it wont just be somewhere,  anywhere at the location on question?
---
Think it's a PC player issue, console seems to work fine.. I haven't gotten to do it personally because of the lack of notification. Any time I see the event on the map, it disappears within seconds.
---
Possum knows whats up. If you want to one shot things btw get adrenalin 3 or 5 and as you rack up kills, change to a pump shot gun for that sweet, sweet head poping damage.
---
I found the plan for it in flatwoods aswell. Idk if what it is is random but it was next to the armor workbench there I believe. I know which building but dont remember the type of bench. So this is probably barely helpful
---
Excellent thanks
---
that's crazy the vendor buys them for 500 I won't someone for less than 500 cuz I can just takethem to the vendor and get 500. I bought my first four for 3500 so I feel like I'm cutting a pretty good deal.
---
Now that's a statement I can get behind and support &lt;3
---
I am a sneaky rifleman as well and here is my opinion.:
---
Strength is too high. Drop that shit by like, 3 and allocate those to perception or Intel. To compensate for the lower strength, use unyeilding pieces and get a backpack, the grinding is worth the extra 60lbs of carry weight.  Also, if you can avoid it, don't carry a ton of junk around all the time. No need to. All you're doing is making it easier to lose it via death. 
---
Perception needs to be at least 11 or 12 but most people I know max it out. Max all rifleman perks and tank killer for sure. Maybe glow sight for extra bang against glowing critters. 
---
Endurance is way too high. Drop it to like, 2 or 3 at the most. Allocate perk points elsewhere. Cannibal is situational so there's no need to have it on all the time. Kill those ghouls/scorched/ mutants and then swap cannibal out for use then put it back. Similar to lock pick and terminal hacking cards. Use the points you have for the perks that make you fuller longer. Theres also a perk that gives you bonuses for being full. Good for AP regen and what not. 
---
Charisma too high. Only 1 or 2 in charisma. No need to Max out lone wonderer. Just use base level of it and that's enough. 
---
My Intel is at 11. I have gunsmith and demo expert maxed out and have 1 point in nerd rage that I switch out for scrapper/chemist etc when crafting and scrapping weapons. 
---
Agility needs to be a little higher; like at a 9 at least so you can get more adrenaline. Also gun-fu is amazing and I use it in vats ALL THE TIME. I one shot shit like crazy with gun-fu and andrenaline. You also need to get rid of action boy, it's not needed with unyeilding amor pieces and the above stated perk in endurance that gives bonuses to AP regen for being well fed (can't remember the name of it). Also get covert operative for better sneak damage. Max that shit out. 
---
Your luck is okay...but you NEED bloody mess. Like, I can't believe you don't have it already. Forget serendipity... you're gonna die sometimes. The vats cards are great also. But you need to find a way to fit bloody mess in. Extra damage. 
---
You're on your way. If you don't have the adrenal reaction mutation yet then find a way to get it. It'll help immensely with damage output running your health so low.
---
Not really need team for free range I've solo it before
---
So at least you can recover what you‚Äôve lost.
---
It's a momentary notification that lasts maybe 2 seconds, really tiny in top left.. is that really needing a toggle?
---
There's a specific spot at each tourist location.
---
Got a bloodied fatman for like 200 or so caps, which I'm very curious to test out. Was using a standard one for the Atomics challenge, barely spec'd into explosives, was still hitting like 750+, so I'm very curious what I can push this one to. Just sitting in the stash currently.
---
I've found that around 9 luck, it already fills more than fast enough.
---
That can't be correct, as the spawn point is fairly consistent. It's easy to set up a trap if you know where it is.
---
Unless you already have all of the plans in the game I would use the treasure maps personally.
---
Profit!
---
People seem to enjoy my 25c spawn default power armor pieces. Probably saves them a lot of time. My store is about 50% PA and 50% random dirt cheap plans
---
Ahhh that's right. If you're up there then they do put a target on you don't they. Well then in that case, make yourself melee or something lol.
---
That's because the "Wieght" is not actually based off pounds or kilos. No wepon makes sense under either system. Instead, best I can tell, it's based off volume or general bulk  (kinda wieght+size). That kinda, atleast for me, justifies the wieght reduction perks, rather than making them physically wiegh less, the perks make your character better at packing them Tetris style.
---
It's hard to imagine an emptier assertion

I highly reccomend you listen the entire way through, if only for the rendition of country roads.
---
You don‚Äôt use a terminal there‚Äôs a hallway with a keypad and you have to go downstairs to a terminal and get the shut down code and then return to the computer used to initiate the event and shut the computer off
---
 **Weapon Artisan** lvl 3 will repair guns to 200%
---
Sounds bad ass, would love to try one out
---
That's pretty much what i'm saying.
---
&gt; The game freezes when you die on the event, or you'll end up in an infinite loading screen (10 mins loading till I gave up and reloaded the game), this happens mostly when you become a conduit from activating a pylon.  
---
Still happening, I just got this bug.
---
Dang. Well, thanks for letting me know before I jump in this weekend :P
---
I hate gulpers
---
Finally, someone gets it
---
Yeah I had this as well, just before I gave my last breath protecting an almost dead yogi by myself I'd tagged two legendary cave crickets and managed to get a hit on the SS before the crickets turned on me. By the time I respawned everything was dead, event finished and I could find what happened to any of the legendaries...
---
I got the impression that was more a consequence of Van Lowe than Bysshe directly.  
---
They wanted him for some apparent robotics expertise (whatever the hell he did to that thing's laser, not to mention the shielding, would've paid for a medium-size state in Defense contracts) but gave him a long leash to run.  
---
His obsession took hold and he modeled it off the 'squatch, to his detriment.  
---
At least, that's what I took the notes and holotapes to mean.
---
Ah.  Gotcha
---
Look here, it's what I used:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgkq7y/tourist_location_masterpost/
---
I dont think that one triggers anything, it's just a broken camera lol
---
Thank you, but where do you get the shut down code?  This is the problem I‚Äôm having.
---
It gave me some lip trying to buy springs last week but I spammed the purchase key till it went through. Probably not a good idea.
---
If you can‚Äôt place a mechanical door to have the keypad outside, remove walls over and/or under it, you‚Äôll then be able to switch the direction it‚Äôs facing.
---
You shush!
---
On top of rejoin last server, I'd like it that every time I join a new server I am guaranteed a freshly stocked dungeon. I hate how farming is tedious in this game and you have to server jump several times to find an untouched WesTek or Whitespring etc. To the devs, make this game as similar to the legendary game Diablo 2:LOD as possible please!
---
Idem
---
Nice help list. Thanks from the dwellers
---
I know you might find this crazy but I enjoy playing this game. I'd much rather earn my guns by playing the game the way it's supposed to be played.
---
Barabarian, Glow Sight (at least 1 pt), Radicool, Tenderizer (1 pt, optional), Makeshift Warrior (at least 2pt), Nerd Rage, Evasive, Adrenaline (at least 1 pt), Bloody Mess and if you sneak, get Sneak, Ninja, and Escape Artist. You should also try to get Dodgy or Serendipity, with a slight lean towards Dodgy. Full unyielding armor.
---
If you're on PC and want to go unarmed, I have a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet &amp; Mole Miner gauntlet for sale. The damage you do when fully spec'd is insane. I've solo'd the SBQ before and I can 1 shot every mob there...that's how insane it can be, 20k+ per hit. Just leave the ISS alone...it will one shot *you*!
---
Everyone is giving tips about junk but also check your aid, Stimpaks are heavy. You don‚Äôt have to hoard those they are easy to come by if you need some. Do an event or 2 then you have 10-15 if you need. Don‚Äôt stash to much ammo or fusion cores. But what most are saying about junk is true. If it‚Äôs easy to come by keep less of it around, if you use it often you can keep a bit more. Steel, wood and plastic are easy to get if you use scrapper do a run through harpers ferry, by the end you‚Äôll have 50-100+ of each by scrapping the guns you loot
---
When a rival player is downed it makes a great bayonet moment!    
---
*Try it!*
---
yep the objective should be completing the event not tagging one enemy for leg. loot
---
Yes, Bethesda, this is a problem now. Enemies and player camps and what not take a long time to load in now. You can‚Äôt fast travel for several minutes until crap has all loaded in. When I load into a world my camp will spawn one piece at a time and I‚Äôll have floating walls or floating turrets. It‚Äôs probably server speeds being affected by the new player vendors
---
Yes, it is.
---
I fell through the made with 2k screws yesterday
---
Agreed.. do the mahi.. get the treats..
---
I've gone into the bunker to heal and change weapon and often see 3 or 4 people just standing there..
---
Meanwhile we're all doing the work..
---
Have all the tidepool badges and all the stuff out of the vending machine still have five badges left in my inventory to spend on something but I don't know what. 
---
I know they are expanding it and putting the squirrel scouts in as the badge is already in the game nobody's found out how to become a squirrel scout yet though
---
It‚Äôs on a terminal in the room.
---
I cants sell you AIDS but I do sell purified water and stims.
---
This was an issue before the vendors, started around a month ago
---
Pic?
---
One lying on car hood out in front of whitesprings.  I see him all the time.
---
It doesnt let you post pics on this subreddit. Any suggestions for hosting websites?
---
It seems spotty for sure. I've only run into invisible once, but sometimes my camp will load like immediately, rest of the time its a full minute plus. While this is happening no vendors are available, nor is the scrip machine.
---
But it's only every other server for me, it bounces back n forth constantly.
---
still trying to get the diffuser recipe but luckily just as I was about to log off last night I did one more event and it dropped the formula P.
---
You have everything you need in Flatwoods.  Roam up and down the river picking bloodleaf (green thumb is a must)  Then roam around the floodplain south of the town collecting wood and soot flowers.  
---
Make healing salves 
---
Sell to vendors.
---
Profit
---
You can also make some water purifiers at your camp. 
---
Sell the water. 
---
Profit.
---
Kill animals, cook their meats into food.
---
Sell to vendors
---
I make most of my cash from selling water and food items that I know will spoil before I use them.   At lvl 166 the early game caps farm methods are still the best.
---
Though I will add: there should b wieght reduction perks 4 rifles, like all other wepons.
---
I can confirm.  I did this accidentally once on a horde that was travelling on a road following the boss, and I started killing them from behind.  I killed the last 'minion' and a whole pack of glowing mobs and another legendary showed up (just as described, sorry for the recap).  That's how I've been doing those ever since.
---
Lost 10,000 caps on a purchase.
---
Nice. May I ask how many animals survived for that one?
---
Yeah. I got killed by a bear and i was in that area for awhile exploring. I just started losing health and had no clue why. Than i had  3 high lvl ghouls kill me because they were nowhere to be seen and i had nowhere to jump too.
---
Borderlands and guild wars solved this a long time ago. Loot and xp for everybody around. It's so frustrating. It's the main reason I don't play. Everyone's an enemy when they can "steal your kills."
---
I mean in a world this fucked, I don't care who shot the supermutant trying to kidnap me, I'm just glad it's dead.
---
That's the end of the map.
---
Yes I got it earlier today.
---
HA
---
As others have said, yes you can...but there is a lot of clipping in the front. The Cowboy Hat and Prospector Hats do quite a bit. The BOS Hood looks good though.    
---
Just adding info.
---
Imgur is popular here
---
Meh, same here. I solo-ed it my first time but I was lvl 110 and heavy guns / Power armor build so I can hold my own against robots. lvl 3 hacker perks are a huge help because you can turn the sentry guns on the robots to help clear things out (remember to turn them back off before going in the room you just wiped out, lol). If you are not afraid of robots it can be done solo.
---
I thought this had happened to me the other day after buying a shotgun from a vendor machine I checked my inventory for 10mins up and down the list to no avail. It wasnt until I switched to the weapons tab I saw my new purchase was there but had renamed itself to the same as my custom excavator name, it maybe the same for you if it was a weapon or armor piece you have bought  possibly?
---
This is an online game with an economy and using in game currency or items to trade for things you want is playing the game the way it was meant to be played. Using real money is wrong and those people should be punished but players who grind caps and items to get the things they want are doing nothing wrong.
---
My favorite is that when this happens your character doesnt even make a sound... not hit sounds or anything. The health just goes down and you die.
---
I do the sunshine farm cranberry run come home and make as much relish as I can, then turn the rest into cranberry pie. since the effects don't stack I usually leave a brown paper bag with two water and a cranberry pie or two on top of each one of my vendors .
---
I got a level 50 instigating hunting rifle for 200 caps. And the plans for the fixer for 150.
---
Yep.
---
Nope, been trying for 2 days now.
---
You really need to focus on PER, AGI, and LCK for max damage output. Stop worrying so much about weight management, and get a backpack.
---
I do 800 base dmg with a BE lever action and full perks, I don't even bother with CRIT perks anymore. Everything but SB's and bosses die in one hit without them, and I can swap in as needed.
---
[My build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4d33abc&amp;d=sb1p00c71s01pd2pk2pp2pl2ir2ic1ib4s70ar2an2au2a30lt2lu2la2l71lr0eh1eu0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=124589acf) for reference.
---
Two days so far and WAY too many tries.
---
Ah right I didn‚Äôt know if you could fix it up and use it for the atom challenges or not, it‚Äôs a shame you have to hunt down these dead tourists it would have been handier don‚Äôt through a poster interaction ü§î
---
I'm taking about the people who buy them with real money. Where can I buy a two shot explosive in game?
---
I got the plan it learned automatically
---
What you gonna do if I don't? Destroy my base in adventure? Pvp me? üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
---
Thanks very much for the extra information, I'm going to wear it with the silver shroud fedora so hopefully it won't clip through lol
---
The only terminal I found in that basement was the engineer terminal and it had logs on it.  Was it in one of the logs?
---
I‚Äôm on the fence when it comes to this issue.   I like the organic feel of the random prices people set.  I played an mmo with complete fan made databases and market tracking sites and it was sweet but I think I‚Äôd become a slave to the numbers and be tracking prices like crazy.   Also with our cap limit it all seems kinda pointless.   I‚Äôve been selling most things at a good discount just to keep it moving and because I don‚Äôt really need the caps.
---
Wow, I have a lot of the cards you've talked about already, (I went heavily into melee) I just need a bloodied weapon. What are you selling your weapons for? I don't have many caps but I'll see what I can do over the weekend!
---
Bought a high capacity backpack but it's AWOL
---
Sometimes people sell them in vending machines or check the trading subs. And fyi two shot explosives are not the best explosive weapons
---
http://imgur.com/XN6hWSB
---
Looks great with the lab coat
---
These posts are always awful.  Not the post but all the responses and the fact op replies get down voted. 
---
You are right:  there is something flawed with survival mode.  Whether it's getting poprocked constantly by someone who bought their explosive weapon with real money or the constant camping, or the people who think Survival is FallNite.  (or FortOut)
---
I just hope they are gathering info and listening to suggestions for a great big NonLegendary Survival only character refresh.
---
Sameeeee.  Its literally torture looking at them because I have hardcore OCD.
---
This is exactly why I will not do this backpack quest. It is a grindy disastrous fetch quest that will take ages. I got infuriated when I did the quest objectives and got to the earn 3 badges part. I refuse to do this quest.
---
Is there any modification available?
---
Absolutely fantastic!
---
You're lucky the Nightstalker Wendigo didn't show up.  Pro tip, don't do any gigs for the Sons of Dane.
---
agree on both counts
---
You can also fire up the game without using the Launcher, you'll have to sign in every time though.
---
100% Agreed.  We still have workshops and bounties for PvP.
---
I sell mine for 1 cap - just to get rid of the suckers
---
But you still get normal drills. Not even legendary
---
I can appreciate looking at it that way. Just seems less fun for me and I'd rather go for the difficult path just for the excitement alone.
---
Trade you for it for something you want ., I like that gauss
---
Does it have any perks? Or is it just the look
---
You can't trade backpacks themselves. You probably bought the plans for the high capacity mod.
---
Absolutely agreed. It'd be nice that they also spend the time to crunch out long standing issues and QoL requests like:
---
* Bulk Junk auto-scrap bug
---
* Event timer/fail condition indicator on map
---
* Fast travel mats for camps
---
* Nuke zone spawn prevention when connecting to the world
---
* ...and many others
---
I've had that bug couple weeks ago
---
I'd prefer if they combine the weapon damage and weight reduction perks. Rank 1 would just be damage, rank 2 would add weight reduction, and rank 3 would increase/decrease both significantly. That way you spend less points on reduction perks, make the cards we have more interesting, and hopefully make everyone happy. Perhaps they'll add something like that as a legendary/prestige card.
---
Just the look sadly. A reduction to chem weights or a 15% buff to stims would be nice though
---
Yes I did..  any suggestions where it might be?
---
Pretty weird one tho..
---
Yeah. There hasn't been anything more on it. 
---
Or nothing positive. "Decorating with found objects" seemed to have faded away and now there are talks of display cases. If cases are for weapons and armor, cool, but I want to place found objects throughout my camp, not just in cases.
---
See you there!
---
Weight reduction cards and legendary armor that reduce weapon weight. I've got 2 bits of armor that reduce weapon weight by ~20% each and 2 that reduce ammo weight by ~20%.
---
BLOODY FURIOUS EXPLODING DRILL 20000 CAPS BUY BUY BUY
---
For me it was the 5,846,206 photos taken with JUST the camera, not photo mode. If every person took 50 photos that‚Äôs almost 117,000 people.
---
You have to start even first and then do it
---
I agree with a lot of what you're saying. Especially your Strength choices. But Rather than gunsmith I think white night may be better between the two so I should have done that of the two. I'll keep 4 in strength next time but do Strong back. I don't need bandolier as I keep less than 10 lbs of ammo on me at a time. Radicool could supplement the strength I've lost. Extra strength points could all go in Perception for 4 more points in rifleman. I'll go for grim reaper as opposed to Four leaf clover although I'm using both right now. Now the question is should I start another character or fix this one in 30 more levels. That's 60 levels of XP on a new character. That seems to make more sense.
---
10 lbs is 4.54 kg
---
All aboard the reality train. This mfer is driving it. I call the caboose.
---
While were at it could we remove or alter the stalker effect on melee weapons.
---
During the 3 days of set we met a Sheepsquatch.
---
Luckily, it was just a fake one and we find out that our Power Armor prop was a great conductor. 
---
Also, we were dupers with a bunch of TSE rifle.
---
Shame on us, I know.
---
Just read anither pointless RaiDEr post, where they're ineffectively waving their dingus around. You won't have a hard time imagining.
---
I need this done too, if you want to add me my username is revmaynard  - I won't be on for about another 30-45min though.
---
False, I‚Äôm on XB and it crashes often. All platforms are having problems with it
---
I finally got the Small Letters plan yesterday, dude had it for about 500 caps. Never was able to justify to myself paying the vendor's price, so I'm super stoked I found it.
---
Its on the engineer terminal but will only be there if you logged in the aric-4 terminal first
---
Basically do the terminals in this order :  aric-4 (project paradise), engineer (shut down code), aric-4(shut down)
---
I think options like this SHOULD be in the loot pool. RNG loot like this should have great options but also bad ones too. 
---
I'd much rather they work on making 3\* mobs drop 3\* legendaries more consistent than removing bad loot from the pool.
---
Soz I meant chems
---
Exactly and I‚Äôm thinking hanging onto any of this junk is just a waste of stash space now.
---
thank you I'm gonna refer to this now. a little more detailed lol
---
4k caps
---
not sure mine is gone too
---
They've kinda hinted that placing found items isn't viable in this game due to server limitations. Hence the drop bags when we drop items.
---
I am still holding out hope but I wouldn't hold my breath for this one. üòê
---
Is this the new meme question? I swear I've seen it asked a dozen times in 3 says. Lol
---
It's not PvP, it's "survival" mode. I doubt any serious FPS gamers would consider FO76 a PvP game.
---
Basically the rng is unbiased. All combinations of items and effects have an equal drop rate. The issue is that a 3 star legendary mobs drop table includes all 1* 2* and 3* combinations. So there are over 300,000 different combinations of items that can drop.
---
But then when you don‚Äôt have team mates it‚Äôs really terrible lol - healing factor / adrenal reaction / marsupial are some of the best
---
Well I got in contact with Bethesda and they basically told me there‚Äôs nothing they can do since the cutoff date has passed.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it stays unless you pick up new junk after death. 
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong anyone
---
And knowing is half the battle...
---
It was the MOTHMAN!
---
Who knew it was a mutant clothes moth!
---
Think they‚Äôve been bugged since beta
---
Never thought of it like that.
---
It will still be there if you can find it
---
Your tag is brotherhood, you‚Äôre supposed to help your fellow brothers out ;) you need to change it to a selfish raider, you‚Äôre not wanted with my brothers anymore
---
But, the only way to get the meat for the recipe is by killing a sheepsquatch. What's the point of having the recipe if you don't intend to kill him for his tasty bits?
---
Okay, what chems did you take? I want that!
---
That's why I run a Slocum's Joe instead of a restaurant. Faschnacht donuts never go bad. Neither does Sunshine oil!
---
HOW DARE YOU TELL US HOW TO HANDLE OUR ENTITLEMENT COMPLEX!
---
It's like you expect us to treat devs as people... :)
---
I was a lone wanderer, low/poor gear, scavenging build and did my one and only silo run all by myself (took 3 hours). I‚Äôm on PC and would be happy to give you an assist (unless you want someone to kill everything quick...then I‚Äôm not your guy).
---
It makes no loud noise, it only appears in very small text for about 2 seconds.. comparing it to a text/call/**car alarm** is pure exaggeration.
---
Because leaderboards are in other games and are an important part of competitive game design.
---
And they are by far the most horribly implemented feature most of the time they are included. And by included, I mean crammed in because "we just gotta have a leaderboards!"
---
Gamification swept the world a few years ago and the unimaginative just throw a leaderboard into something and call it a game.
---
True, I‚Äôm on team about 80% of the time over the last month or so. Adrenal Reaction would be my second choice as it‚Äôs very powerful when I‚Äôm using my bloodied LMG.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. It‚Äôs a new bug to me. Makes my bloodied build pretty difficult to use.
---
You can revive anyone to colmplete it, I just joined a high level event revived someone there.
---
I really do hope we get to display and place any item we want. 
---
I‚Äôve been collecting ALL magazines, ALL bobble heads and loads of different items. 
---
And I‚Äôm just waiting as well üòÇ
---
Exactly. Your down health or almost fully radiated before you realize i have to run and hide for a few.
---
Forest area around Muntions factory is 100 haunted by aliens, take heed from a Bullet Farmer. It‚Äôs not much info, but it‚Äôs honest work.
---
Max being the operative word, if you feather it you can mostly get it in 1-2.
---
Thanks bot although all countries use the same weight in the fallout universe.
---
Nice! This is my pricing scheme for fusion cores too!
---
Savage I'm gonna try this
---
Yea, thanks everyone! I've also tried pricing my stuff lower to pay it forward to people even lower than me. haha
---
I feel like I was in that uranium fever event with you. The dude with the Tesla rifle gapped every single legendary miner and I got 0 legendaries.
---
...anything but support your claim.  I win.
---
It is especially super easy with latest Windows 20, just press Print Screen and select the area for screenshot
---
At least i didn't ask if i should get the game
---
Also I would recommend buying the recipes from players as it is less expensive than the enclave
---
You forgot to add "now go home and get your fuckin shinebox".
---
I want my ED-209 sentry bot to guard my base and annihilate anything that comes within 100 yards!
---
Ok Xbox? Around 9am est?
---
I'm starting to think that the bug is intended by Bethesda. Because I don't see a reply from Bethesda about the broken dailies in the Mire, specially the queen of the hunt daily. Their reason is probably to prevent players to find flatwoods monster / alien easily; just by doing a daily quest...
---
lol. r/fo76FilthyCasuals just like to THINK that they're the less toxic ones...
---
On the very odd occasion it may still be there, but without an indicator too. But where your original death occurred.
---
Damn bro...
---
Do the west tek mission. :)
---
I sell all my plans at 25c each no matter what they‚Äôre valued at. I get tons of business because of it. The ‚Äúcha-ching‚Äù sound happens very often and is pure music to my ears. All my Bobbleheads and Mags are 50c each. Ammo is 1c each. I‚Äôd say I undersell most of my wares but I get lots of business because of it.
---
If u picked up more junk before u died the second time your first bag disappears
---
Fanatic Bethesda fans will praise the company how fast it fix these things if they remove those useless items from legendary loot pool in the next 2-3 years.
---
Okay, my username on here is my psn if you want to add me
---
My buddy sells resistant BoS suits fo 300-400 but its what people seem to want, +Str and +Per I think. I like to have vault suit for +Chr and Lck sometimes.
---
I thought vendor purchases were guaranteed to be whatever star u pay for? Im rolling nothing but junk but its always 3 star and traded back for 40 scrip
---
Sure, my username is the same as my psn
---
They are referring to the vats of FEV that are all over West Tec. They use it to create more Super Mutants.
---
I‚Äôm not a run and gun, I like to explore a bit, pick up way too much junk. I have one of the key cards already too. I‚Äôm about level 70 I think. I kind of lost count after 50 because you don‚Äôt get more perks.
---
Can I continually upvote this until Bethesda cares? Because I want this to be a thing.
---
I sell liquor and preserved foods like instamash and sugar bombs. do people buy beer bottles or is this a bad market to make money from
---
That‚Äôs me too, though it‚Äôs hard to keep my ammo full. It goes faster than I can get materials to make it.
---
Did they add fridges other than the backpack mod?
---
In this instance, I was after ore to craft ammo.
---
As far as I am aware just the one but it had virtually full health
---
If any particular items are significantly out of balance they need to be nerfed. Claiming that nerfing is bad because they don't understand the game balance is a bit silly as it assumes they know game balance so well that the created an optimal state in the first place.
---
That bit sounds boring. Screw that.
---
In the Notes category, like any other plan...
---
I use a bloodied build with fireproof armor, concentrated fire, serendipity, abestos chest mod, and give or take few sentinal and assassin armor if u can find it. Bloodied Gauss
---
If your performance bothers you could play full agility with max action points and pistols. Then you autotarget via VATS and just press the trigger.
---
Melee has targeting bugs currently. In that you might not suck as hard as you think. The combat just does not work as intended. Anyway, have fun.
---
Quote " Bobbleheads and Magazines for the future display or for challenges " I'm just saying that the magazine for possum collection badge doesn't count toward the challenges. You need to obtain it yourself.
---
&gt; Warning: If a negative comment or response is made, you will be ignored. 
---
Dude, that's not how this works... It's like a beacon for all the trolls to get you to react.
---
One other thing I think you can add is knowing what your goal is - is it profit maximisation or stash clearance. Each have very different approaches to pricing, location and what you should be stocking in the vending machines.
---
BOS Soldier suit plan for 5 caps. Turned around and sold it for 1k
---
Claim? It was an statement based on observed data.
---
You stated "we farm materials from Adventure players". If your rAidEr epeen was actually as big as you claim, you would be farming materials from Survival players. 
---
But, you clearly stated you're not. Leading to the **supported** observation that you can't, in fact, hack it in Survival.
---
Dude, just go back to roblox, tricking 7 yrs old into trade requests.
---
I found her at the mothman statue as well Haha it was my third try though haha but thanks
---
I saw a Bloodied shovel with swing speed and +1 strength on here the other day and I‚Äôve been dreaming about it ever since lol
---
This is why I don't lock anything in my camp, including the junk extractor. I want you guys to take what you need.
---
Ok cool, thanks.
---
The entire thing is designed to feed the hype train for e3 :(  
---
But cool, looking forward to nuclear winter especially the prestige system :)
---
You can‚Äôt go that way is the games way of saying it‚Äôs unplayable, yes.
---
I‚Äôm not positive but one the burn seems to be longer? I could have been imagining it but it seemed to do a bit more damage from burn time. I tried on 2 identical Vampire Lasers (non explosive because I don‚Äôt have 2 of those) but they seem to be pretty much the same.
---
Wellllllll. And maaaaaaybe, possibly, old campfire glitches that can't be done any more. Though I haven't really seen very many of those as vendors.
---
But it does.  A 25 pound weight in fallout 76 has a weight off 25.
---
I do Resistant BoS as well, though less caps than that.
---
This is from Bethesda's home page.
---
" We‚Äôre excited to continue this journey with you, and we can‚Äôt wait to share more details about what we have in store for Appalachia and the Fallout 76 community during our fifth annual Bethesda E3 Showcase. "
---
Maybe they will introduce legendary Bear Arms in E3? That would perfectly fit how they advertise and what they deliver to the people. This might be their big thing in E3! Fanatic Bethesda fans would be satisfied for years from that kind of news. Huge step to the Fallout 76!
---
Hm. Never made the connection, but I guess it's possible. I think I may have a false memory of super mutants saying that back in FO4...
---
Love the .50 cal! I can‚Äôt count the number of times I‚Äôve seen mobs killed in the time it takes my laser/plasma/regular Gatling to wind up 8-P
---
they better be raider themed
---
&gt; That's what my vampiric .50 cal is for.
---
Are you a heavy weapon toon? Except for SBQ, ISS, and nuke zone mobs I have a hard time not killing shit either in 1 shot or 2 with my vampiric .50 cal and its kind of hard to always just shoot 1 bullet with as fast as the .50 cal is.
---
Adventure players tend to have more junk, has nothing to do with survival ability.
---
Higher level areas sell for 50-100.
---
I don't know where all these ammo purchasers are. I've tried selling all of the above ammo and NONE of it sold ever. Had better luck selling plans and aid than those.
---
That would be awesome!
---
That‚Äôs where you ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù step in front of one of his shots and hope he doesn‚Äôt have Pacifist enabled...
---
I've been there enough to be sick of it, so I know about the vats, but I didn't connect it. I guess it makes a certain amount of sense. Cheers.
---
The one good thing about completely ridiculous challenges like this one is they save me from wasting time attempting them.
---
I've got an explosive cryolator, its great for tagging things at range while also slowing them down to make the hordes/bosses easier to manage.
---
This is usually the case but I have occasionally picked up two death bags. Mostly this occurs when the second death is pretty quick after the first and you must get the first one first.
---
Does the fixer have a special plan?
---
I didn‚Äôt know names n‚Äô unique reward weapons had that. Nor have I seen them to be buyable anywhere. 
---
Guess I‚Äôve been real unlucky or it‚Äôs a very rare item
---
I've encountered the flatwoods monster twice and both times attacking it caused my game to crash.
---
Gee, you really are.... stupid.
---
A guy I used to team up with had this absolutely EPIC rant one night about how angry it makes him that the handmade uses 5.56 ammo. I believe his argument was that, as an AK style gun, it should use 7.62. He was a gun fan and the inaccuracy was more than he could take lol
---
Marsupial is a GAME CHANGER! Highly recommend it.
---
I currently use marsupial/healing factor/plague walker/electrically charged/speed demon
---
But definitely get marsupial first. All around awesome
---
Fully automatic railway rifle
---
In my case, it's the powered door with keypad, but yeah, same idea.  I had originally hidden the combination behind the huge Welcome Home sign, but once they fixed camp destruction, I initially 'locked' the doors open by using a terminal to turn all the switches on, but later decided to keep roaming creatures out by posting the combo visibly.  People are welcome to enter, clean out the junk extractor, empty the water purifiers, etc.  The only locked thing in the whole place is the terminal.
---
Oh ho, making excuses now?
---
I might give some money for some raider themed anything
---
Wow. Why the downvote for this reply?
---
As someone who does the challenges, they are fun, when I saw this I was what????
---
How about kill a intoxicated lengendary deathclaw in the forest after drinking a nuka shine while wearing a tin hat with a meat hook while alone and take a pic to prove it!!!!   :)
---
I either melee or TSE gating lower levels mobs.
---
on XB1 I also have been unable to do the mire dailies. They never spawn at all.
---
Who the hell knows. Lol
---
Pretty sure I have the vault 76 jumpsuit plan, so I can make you a new one when I'm on tonight
---
RemindMe! 5 hours
---
I dont but survival has become basically all pvp in my experience.  The second someone sees another player they start shooting
---
Same.
---
OK, new development appeared. The item showed up with a player given name , however named after my power armor 0\_o

I haven't run into your CAMP then, because I buy at least a few when I see them.
---
I got the impression it was supposed to be a squach hunter robot.  The mating habits protocol had to come into effect somewhere.
---
Throw in even 1 level of Gun Fu and you don‚Äôt even have to re-VATS between kills
---
Yeah, but open yourself to PVP.
---
&gt;Dude, that's not how this works... It's like a beacon for all the trolls to get you to react.
---
I removed it. Thanks for the heads up. I just wish people would understand that I'm trying to help out but it's all these players who want to cause issues saying you have to be doing this and not do this.
---
&gt;One other thing I think you can add is knowing what your goal is - is it profit maximisation or stash clearance. Each have very different approaches to pricing, location and what you should be stocking in the vending machines.
---
I didn't think of it that way. Maybe I can implement that into the guide. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I've paid as much as a couple hundred caps for a full one. I buy every one I see when I'm above 24,000 caps.
---

Personally I love it, it makes the game interesting and speeds up PVP encounters, but the majority of the reason my friends and I aren‚Äôt playing as much is the pitiful rewards for killing players. 12-3 caps isn‚Äôt enough to keep my fast travel up. 100-150 for the killer would be great.
---
Why the hell would X01 Military Paint be a quick seller?  It's available on the vendor in the bunker at all times.
---
Does this imply that anyone who shoots a boss gets loot? 
---
I  generally run solo and I hit any event I can handle solo. I was running through a quest a few nights ago and happened onto one event that I could not solo, but cleared the event with a couple of power armored, twice my level players. They were mowing things  down with automatic weapons so I didn't get many kills, but after the event I did find loot on the last, legendary, mob. Did I unintentionally steal those items by hitting the legendary first, or does everyone get loot? I've been trying to avoid first hits on legendary mobs if I join an event that anyone else started since I was not sure how loot splitting works. I've never seen a tooltip indicated how that works either.
---
Is there a specific spot? I'm there now and don't see any. Thanks.
---
Thanks for the feedback all, I'll put some of these up for sale today and see how they go. Also, am I the only one that would like to be able to access my sale stats, so I can see what sells and what doesn't?
---
It's off and on for me. Sometimes the game just dashboards when I go down the elevator, sometimes it works. Once it crashes 3 times I wait until the next day.
---
Pretty shitty!
---
Add in my armor not giving me my RR perks and I‚Äôm taking 45 rads a second from ghosts
---
I'm convinced the vendor is biased toward utter junk. I got more pipe weapons, crossbows, and pistols than I ever saw drop naturally.  So I'm thinking legendary vendor is a waste of time.
---
I've been selling the PLAN for the fixer at 1500 each time I get it.  Maybe I'm underselling.
---
Some hoops are worth hopping through. Because I don't have the xbox app on my phone you can even shoot me a DM on here if I'm not online. I have my own company and work from home often and can usually just pop on for a few mins if needed.
---
The crazy thing about that is that tons of people still haven't even found the tourist/camera.
---
I managed to get some challenges completed this way. It's also not for the merit badg but for other challenges in world.
---
Console seems to be like another game. Didn‚Äôt sell one bullet or a fusion core on pc, just some recipes.
---
marsupial and speed demon would be my only two picks for "first" status.
---
Marsupial/ adrenal/ healing factor/ grounded/ unstable isotope/ electrically charged are all huge money makers plus awesome mutations
---
Put it in your machine for 1000 caps and see. Some people just aren‚Äôt on reddit, don‚Äôt keep up with updates on vendor inventories, or simply don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre for sale in the bunker. Either way, they always sell fast
---
Hardbargin bad thing is at the early stage it's hard to invest in this perk versus others.
---
If you're on a team, and reasonably close, you don't have to hit the mob to loot it. You *will* miss out on XP.
---
I guess.
---
Ok cool, we already are mutated for our builds, looking for moneymakers. Thanks!
---
Yep. But that is also because consoles have had more duping and so those items are more common on console. For example the most recent waiterbot dupe barely disrupted the PC economy.
---
Yeah I'm not gonna carry around a gatling on my non heavy weapon toons, there are better lighter options. On my heavy weapon toon a TSE gatling would 1 shot just about anything.
---
I think it‚Äôs just time for another stash size upgrade, it would simplify the situation.  Now that we have a reason to hold more items it truly is necessary.
---
Inside the house, the one with the robots its blue. Not sure if you paid a lot of caps for those, but they have like 3 of each and theres like 20 in there lol
---
I'm on XB as well, can craft the vault suit, or the 76 vualt suit. 
---
I can make you one for free. If you want it shielded too, I'll need 4 flux.
---
I'm constantly maxed on both stash and in pocket, but if they made it a distinct storage limit then people would just use them as a secondary storage and list everything at 25000 caps to keep people from buying out of them.
---
My oft mentioned 3* rolling pin for 32 caps. I'll pay 8 caps for 10 scrip all day long
---
I just want that tire one or more of the brown colored ones!
---
(I love wearing the bomber jacket)
---
Still haven‚Äôt had this issue seen a bunch of other posts non stop since it came out all I can say is RIP
---
Plans for a backpack
---
Thanks. Naw, they were cheap. I just bought all I needed for a set.
---
Play the events I cryptid lots of people die in the water, project pardise and sbq same thing
---
No clue, sorry.
---
Because Bethesda is incompetent asf. The game still continues to be terrible. And dtill i hope that someday they hire some professional people to fix this game and make it great like it is supposed to be.
---
Spider is the man!! and have followed his channel for a minute. Better then that survivalist girl who says any vendor with 10 bloodied weapons is a cheat and she will report you.
---
dang yo I was playing it fine consecutively when it first came out no prob it didn't start doing this until that night and now its a few days later and I still cant load in properly
---
Guess you don't know what those are either
---
iirc they put out a post awhile ago talking about placing your found items on display shelves. I have to agree with what the others said, they're probably gonna limit the hell out of it due to server limitations. With that said I'm welcome to anything good they do with camps
---
its a rip for sure dude they should fix it though literally the best content in the game and im being essentially barred from playing it
---
I'd buy all the rad ant lagers at 10 caps...
---
The only problem with this is the rampant duping that occurred when the game came out and still continues in smaller capacities.  It made PvP p2w, either buy duped gear off the market subs or get wrecked by someone who did.
---
You're making it sound like buyers are grinding gear/caps to get sellers legitimately obtained gear.  Buyers are grinding gear/caps to have the same duped OP gear everyone in survival mode has.  Market subs shouldnt be a requirement to compete; grinding yourself as OP is describing should be viable.
---
It will just takes time my man, not sure why some people get it and others don‚Äôt
---
Tag a legendary, thump them with your rifle but dont kill it. Move on to kill the other nonlegendarys. That legendary will likely drop better loot when you come back to it. That is the current belief
---
It worked couple hours afterward. But server hopping did not fix it right away
---
You can have both at the same time, but if you have choose between them then explosive
---
hehehe I think your probally right it certainly feels that way, to have a new dlc be broken and to have it be unplayable for so many people. it is unfortunate :(
---
I havent seen the leaks.
---
I too have use the jacket
---
Gatling laser please! Also change the beam color! üòÅüëçüèª

Yes seriously

---
That is my build, get a full set of unyielding armor and you are good to go. You will have plenty of DR from the perk cards
---
There is no way a seller can time that exactly with the delay it takes to shut down even if powering off. We are taking ms
---
I didn‚Äôt luck out and get them stacked, but have two decent ones with either perk. Thanks though, I‚Äôve been scratching my head on this one.
---
Because its been ONE day. Things take longer then one day generally to diagnose and hotfix
---
Well thanks, that explains why then. I was going to the scout camp trying to trigger it.
---
Please
---
Commie lovers! The whole lot of yah with your cap sinks and your selling stuff for 1 cap and your who needs caps. Your game play is bad game play and you Al can stay out of mah free states.
---
Here's one https://youtu.be/Mj_F46Wwyxc
---
Def the explosive. Two shot is good as welll but u get a huge drop in accuracy
---
And my minigun weighing at only 30 pounds is ridiculous, shhhh please
---
Um, wouldn‚Äôt protecting your junk from radiation HELP repopulation efforts?
---
And no, I‚Äôm not meaning gears and steel...
---
Camera film at 3 caps, diluted stims at 3 caps, diluted rad away at 3 caps, shileded Bos and enclave at 600, any t50b at lvl50 for 50 caps. Calibrated excavator legs for 600.
---
And you can find them all over reddit
---
Absolutely. In WoW they either instance the loot in way everyone gets access to it, or have the boss be a persistent corpse all can loot.
---
I think, aside from the event completion, Boss-level creatures need a global loot mechanism, accessed by those who joined the event.
---
In the game itself people are generally good. I've played for 1500+ hours and barely encountered any griefing/trolling etc. 
---
But reddit fucking sucks for toxicity. Just cause you aren't seeing it doesnt mean it isn't there. There are people who follow my posts just to abuse me. I've got a not small blocked list on reddit.
---
That‚Äôs straight. Only in fo76
---
How do you track scores?
---
I got the trophy the other day, I have to go and find my favourite pictures now to respond to this.
---
I didnt knowna wing was needed, but I feel like it has shown up in the pile he leaves behind when he flies away. I know it doesnt make sense!
---
Initiate doesn‚Äôt drop anymore?
---
Not the first frat house with the hats. The other one where the guy who invented Nukashine lived.
---
I can make one for you in about 5 hours, IGN brpst98889, if you do not get one sooner
---
That I could get behind. 
---
I was going to "pvp is competitive so suck it up about the leaderboard"
---
But this still keeps it competitive and allows those who like tension but not the competition to live their life. Additionally makes those who want to actively hunt the leader really have to have hunting skills. 
---
Still I see people complaining. Some would still complain about ANY singling out.
---
I'm pretty sure the people who are downvoting me are the ones abusing the op guns.
---
I rename my items like Joe's dirty butt plug or Frank's dildo, no one looks at them, as good as invisible.
---
Or you could try something like math workbook, I'm sure it's safe
---
I did 8 rolls today for my 2 handed melee character. Got a one handed weapon for 7 of them.
---
Yes this, otherwise we're going to have 10 posts an hour about how we need a notification for the new quest every time one is added. Build it into the personal terminal functions.
---
I still don't know how to do that.
---
I do think the MG42 should have its ammo changed to a 7x62 and have yields comparable to the 5mm and 50 cal. Fuel should also be increased to batches of 100.
---
More heavy MGs would be awesome, I love the MG42 I just wish it was easier to feed
---
Also speed serum since it's the easiest to make. I ether vendor it or sell it for 300
---
I would do that, also only let us spawn at our own camps
---
If you are on PC, you can have the mothman wing I have in my stash
---
I think he had also convinced them that the sheepsquatch was an angle worth pursuing. if they could get their hands on the DNA of a cryptid, who knows what they could het out of it.
---
It's from the new event, It's like day tripper+ if you didnt know, seems the plan is a pretty common drop
---
I actually found one in a player vendor, but I don‚Äôt really know if I want a rifle build character. I‚Äôve been mainly a melee build and it‚Äôs been easier to kill enemies as opposed to using The Fixer. I switched my cards around as much as I could but it still wasn‚Äôt as good as the melee weapon I have. So I‚Äôm unsure of what I want to do, tbh.
---
just received a drill from the legendary in the new Arktos Pharma event...
---
I got lucky and ran it with basically the whole server last night. I saw a couple of dots by it and when I spawned there was 20 other people doing the event, or at least more than I've ever seen for SBQ. So much fun, and the only time I've actually successfully completed it.
---
Also, one of the ingredients I've only seen in that place (Arktos labs)
---
They tend to fix things up before big content updates, like what they did before Wild Appalachia.
---
I kinda hate that you can respec as easily as you can. In most RPGs and older Fallouts, when you wanted to try a different build you made a new character.
---
I think the whole point is to add some more unnecessary balance when you improve your items. I agree though, a handmade should not weigh 20+ pounds. They should have been more smarter about this but it feels like while in design, the devs spent only seconds hashing out the majority of the games mechanics such as this one.
---
I want more kinds of builds to be viable. Seems like it's either bloodied or explosive only to be viable and assassin sential seems like it's the only armor that matters. I'm just complaining about the balance here yes you should have advantages when you build a certain way but there builds that destroy all others that's the issue.
---
You need some help clearing a launching site?
---
Thanks. Hadnt seen them yet. Some cool stuff. I was just thinking yesterday how my camp needs a mailbox.
---
25 or 50
---
Honestly that sub was desperately needed at launch. I swear no one here actually played the game at launch, just came here and bitched about it and ~~camvas~~ nylon bags. The sub has really mellowed out since then and is actually a nice place to come and talk about the game.
---
you just need one piece for chameleon to work
---
Doesn't it feel like a fitting and rewarding experience? üëå
---
Your words hurt my brain.
---
You sure that isn't formula p? Formula Q is the one quercus talla about making that heals the animals.
---
Change could mean expand, as it would change the questline's abrupt ending
---
They are very easy to get. Server hop the enclave and it has a chance of three different mods. Its tricky but there are many many guides out there on this. I have 15+ just for the deep pockets mods waiting while hunting for a good set.
---
Thanks man, that sums it all up. Appreciate your help.
---
You certainly can, it just might become inert. And I haven‚Äôt yet found a use for Inert Flux. Except for eating it, which oddly gives water and a little disease resistance
---
No wait... I got it
---
One piece works, but Chameleon armies do stack. Captainoob did a video about it.
---
np
---
You would have a pretty limited amount of time but I've been in the situation before plenty of times where I had mass and fluids but not the flux I need and vice versa. I'd buy it if I happened to come across you and needed it at the moment which isn't super likely
---
But why would you want to tho? I kill on average 5-10 legendaries there? The ammt of xp and chances to get something good or at the very least stuff to scrip
---
To be fair I sold over 10 of these for about 100 caps each. It's really the most useful recipe duplicate I receive from BIV because it sells almost immediately
---
You don't always have to tag it to get loot. I've tested it out on the Sheepsquatch event before.
---
I'll check it out. Thanks.
---
Request trade ppl outside a nuke zone maybe
---
Lmao . At least it's not like fo3 or new Vegas on PS3. This game is nowhere near as buggy as those games.
---
Explosive imo, but 2s if you are bloody as explosive shotguns tend to go boom too close lol... my bloody explosive shotgun has killed me more than any enemy I've faced...
---
I am, will that work??? :0
---
Well done!
---
Free hydration. I use my leftovers for hydration and sell my purified water if nobody takes it. I leave my purifiers unlocked.
---
Try saying that at lvl 225
---
Try traveling to a location near Arktos such as Greg‚Äôs mine supply and walk up to Arktos and go down the elevator - this has worked for me to stop crashing. I hope it helps you
---
Yeah i think theyve found a good balance
---
The bad options already heavily outnumber the good ones. How many people keep their chinese officer swords that they find vs how many people keep their handmade rifles, even if their build does not use it? How many people keep nocturnal or mutant's or hunter's gear? The reward ratio is already fine, if anything they should make it easier to get the good stuff, like you said by making 2* and 3* enemies guarantee better drops
---
oh, it's for a badge!!! I had no idea to check leaves :o so rare to see him anyway.
---
The quest just says obtain a mothman wing so I think so. Ign fist0 with a zero. Will be on in a few.
---
My Bloodied build uses a mix of Chameleon, Bolstering, and Unyielding.
---
Why? So they can't XP farm?
---
Newb here, what do you mean by tagging....dont hurt me Haha
---
I had 2 spawn today in the bog. One was a level one wise I got to him before he flew away no wing from him. Literally 100 feet away was a lvl 41 vengeful but he did give me a wing either.
---
I noticed that too, very frustrating that a simple change in code is such a huge task it seems cause WR sure as hell should apply to the total weight.
---
Oh dang, My bad dude! You are right, honestly I'm always in a super busy party so never listen to ingame lore... lol...
---
You on pc?  Im near the Charleston train station. Its in vendor for 2k
---
Or, perhaps, from the map menu or the personal terminal we could set an alert to be notified when event(s) of our choosing are active on the server. For you that might be the Beanstalk event. For me it might be Uranium fever. Someone else might want the new Campfire tales event. So much more convenient than opening up the map and scanning it and hoping you see something you like.
---
I would make a new character just to be able to use an explosive drill
---
Dang this post is old. May I ask, how did you find it?
---
The Fireproof perk or a dense chest piece (if you aren‚Äôt in PA) helps.
---
That's actually a good idea. I did not think having twice the same treasure map was useful at first but it's probably better to use them for now.
---
I agree the handmade weighs a bit too much at times even if it is balance purposes they should of put more thought into it.
---
Is that a Gulper behind you??
---
Yeh I didn't want to give up unyielding due to the outrageous Strength for melee.
---
You use a carot in front of a word.
---
So if you wanted to say starwars^tm and make it look like that you would put one ^ in between the two words.
---
 a this is a carot btw ‚Äî&gt; ^
---
I havent seen one since pioneer so maybe no wing drops unless you kill it now, but iirc when he flies away he leaves behind what looks like an ash pile, and i feel like i got a wing before.
---
For sure, I'm not built for guns anyways, so i just run melee and now a be hm for the distance now
---
I found a workaround that works most of the time for me - fast travel to Greg‚Äôs mine supply and then walk up to Arktos Pharma to go down the elevator. I haven‚Äôt crashed going down the elevator since doing this but I still crash randomly other times
---
They've said that in FO4 as well. Always figured it was in reference to radiation, as mutants are known to actively seek out "the glow" because it heals them, and they enjoy the feeling of it.
---
To buy rare stuff that I want but haven't found yet.
---
Why have a savings account?
---
Our Mirelurk Hunter attacked the fn Sheepsquatch at the end. It was my first time, but I got an invite from RifleGaming, so I went to try the event.
---
slyrentinal^tm
---
And apparel too
---
It's easily exploitable. People would just have infinite space. It has to come with a draw back, like you have to lock you boxes or else people could steal it.  Or at least give us the ability to increase the size of our stash box.
---
I wouldn't have noticed if it wasn't for some player using it to heal the animals. It gives a event wide notification that someone used formula q to restore them. I've spent quite a bit of time exploring arktos and haven't found anything.
---
That's what I'm currently trying to do. High level players mostly
---
My Bloodied DCG loves the strength bonus! I use three Unyielding.
---
Well now I'm going to go and search too! For sure will let you know what I find!
---
You definitely should, I love seeing peoples' random pictures from around Appalachia!
---
I'd love legendary drills, but like I said, syringers wouldn't even benefit from most effects. Two shot would really help with the two damage barrels(bleedout/radscorpion venom barrel), and by "really help" I mean turn them from useless to slightly less useless. Endangerol only needs one hit and will not benefit from anything else, so ironically enough stalker's would probably be the best effect for that barrel. All of the damage stuff (X slayer, anti-armor, instigating, bloodied, etc) is absolutely pointless because the initial impact deals like 5 damage, and the DoT comes from separate effects from the two damage barrels. Explosive syringers would be fun, but due to the low damage on the gun, the explosion would literally deal 1-2 damage
---
People complaining that its not realistic that weapons weight 20+ pounds. However people aren't complaining that they can carry 400+ lbs. Very realistic :)
---
ah ok. I didn't see a pile when he flew off.
---
Don't know why you got downvoted for making a joke, so I fixed that for you.
---
1: you're replying to your own post, not my comment, so I'm not getting notified of your replies. 
---
2: to get a backpack you have to complete the Possum challenges for the Ever Upwards quest line. Read the Scouts poster at any train station.
---
Yeah like a colored lens mod
---
Is anyone else experiencing the daily quest issues or item drops from enemies? I can still not get trick or treat to start or one violent night. No matter how many times I server hop or what time a day these quests will not spawn. I've killed 50 deathclaws not 1 has dropped hide. Same with scorchbeasts I've killed a lot never given meat one time. I started the week with 12000+ 5mm ammo now I have none.
---
oh ok thank you for the workaround advice I appreciate it yo, I might try it out.
---
Harrowing! I can't wait to see the Behind the Music follow-up... and your next music video (also, please make more music videos! ).
---
Yep! Perfect way to implement this idea.
---
I saw it once and it helped me find the cafe tables. I just thought of it after realizing you grouped the powered gates **with** the keypad gates.
---
Seriously, a Handmade that weighs 20 lbs with just a few mods is freaking ridiculous.
---
20 lbs is 9.08 kg
---
That‚Äôs the only reason I still have them planted! Enjoy them and my corn, ignore my broken mutfruit that I haven‚Äôt replaced since the molerat attack.
---
The handmade in fallout 4 originally did use 7.62 ammo, but it was changed to 5.56 in fallout 76 for some reason.
---
Most people will get at least 1 rank of pharma free from card packs, so it's not a bad boost
---
This event is DOA until they add it, managed to get 1 successful run. Who knows how many times I‚Äôve missed a good run though because I‚Äôm not checking mini map every minute.
---
I^thought he meant stacked as in more word got smaller above the mallet words
---
Why is everyone suggesting Explosive when the point of a shotgun is to be as close to your target as possible with high per-shot damage output, and Two-Shot grants 5% more damage, and ADSing on a target up-close and hitting (to avoud the VATS accuracy penalty) is arguably easiest with a shotgun?

There should be a weight reduction perk to cover all ranged weapons (melee/armor has it already). Make hand guns light leading up to the big guns being heavy. Balance the power differences between all these types with other advantages to perk types like armor piercing, run speed, VATS (which is kinda being done like already). I have no idea why/how these kinds of things could have slipped past at a some-what high reputable game studio. Balanced mechanics is like 101 in game dev.
---
Sorry, just frustrated sometimes :/
---
To my knowledge, all it does is heal you while NOT in combat. I don't think it affects other healing effects other than stimpaks.
---
To be fair to a lot of those people, there was VERY good reason to negative about the game. It boggled my mind how delusional some people were in the face of overwhelming evidence.
---
I got stuck soloing one at the end. It was seeming doable as thw grafton was mostly just stood in front of a turret doing very little so I'd got it down to about 1/4 health. Then it suddenly decided it was bored of this shit and went charging off and oneshotted the ghoul that was left.
---
This is the problem with many people nowadays (I'm guilty of it too some times) where they have more opinions tan knowledge.  
---
I quote Fallout New Vegas' Thomas Hildern as an example for this community:
---
''*Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have.''*
---
The reason for this: All the things Bethesda keeps mucking with both on thier own will and the requests of community. Accompanied by games massive size and likely taxing amount of ever changing conditions, causes some bog down. Just be patient when waiting 4 camps, and if loading in at a dangerous location, run to safety and wait a sec or do like I do and back into a corner and swing wildly while occasionally jacking stims.
---
That worked. Thanks.
---
I have noticed a bias towards scout as well. Others in the sub have mentioned the same.
---
We should make another kickstarter then!
---
Maybe... Cyberpunk?
---
They never got effects. Flare guns, drills, and syringers are incapable of having legendary effects. The frustration comes from the fact that you kill a 3* legendary enemy and get a junk weapon you can loot from static spawns around the map that sells for like 8 caps. If you could actually get legendary effects on these items, no matter how trash they would be, I wouldn't be complaining about it. At the very least they would be scrip, at the best it would be a fun combination to screw around with
---
Ahhh the good ol'times he? lol
---
Sell it to the vendors
---
I've advocated for this from the beginning. Spawn camping would still be a thing, but it would eliminate people hiding at the edge of the map, or behind elaborate bases, and using the map pointer as bait to draw people to them. They'd have to hunt just as much as anyone else.
---
It'd be nice if the MG42 was finally viable via new ammo type.
---
All challenges only track base value never ammosmith value
---
(Maybe... Cyberpunk???)
---
No m8 on ps4
---
Just make it so you can reallocate SPECIAL points using caps in addition to the current system already available. So if for example you wanna move 7 points from Strength to Perception you can either lvl up 7 times OR you can pay with caps. It could be a fixed amount of caps or varying depending how many points you wanna move, would also serve as a nice cap sink.
---
Heeheehee... thanks! I kind of like the way I play. As my sister put it, even the warriors need the healers.
---
This is happening to me right now! Except I can't repair the camera - it's not showing up on the tinker's workbench. I found the tourist at Giant Teapot and took/read/played all his items. (Xbox one)
---
But I wonder why though?
---
5*, great video
---
I really hope it works but I know it hasn‚Äôt worked for everyone- I know how frustrating getting disconnected is - I still get randomly disconnected- game froze randomly - get stuck doing an emote and cannot move so have to restart the game x x lots of things
---
Mine is the son of fluffy. Nice thing about him is he always respawns shortly and wont attack my C.A.M.P but will attack other enemies if they are close to my C.A.M.P. its awesome
---
And fire rate on crossbows, black powder weapons, etc
---
Really? Editing your posts?
---
Your word salad still didn't refute my post.
---
Cabinets (and pinball machines) are in 76 as well- check upstairs inside Bolton Greens
---
I want to try it again. I broke two guns and used a lot of aid helping people. It‚Äôs nice to see a real challenge for the end game. Shutting down the robots at the beginning should make it easier, but that end boss was a tank. We had 5-10 people over level 100 unloading explosive rounds, and it soaked them up. I was w RifleGaming, and his crew is usually on point.
---
Once in a while it ends in a headshot for me, but it‚Äôs cool. I store my junk regularly.
---
Your welcome lol
---
They did say that Wastelanders will ‚Äúchange the game tremendously‚Äù. Excited to see what‚Äôs in store. My guess is that they‚Äôre going to overhaul the story so you would choose which faction you would like to join to stop the Scorchbeasts, similar to Fallout 4 with multiple endings instead of the story forcing you to join all the factions. - thus also adding Faction PVP. (which they confirmed to be working on.) 
---
Hopefully we might also get to see the emergence of human NPCs along with the return of branching dialogue, along with other features like the Robot Workbench from Fallout 4, or an animal companion.
---
According to data miners, no. It was accidentally removed when the others were added.
---
Vendors are a better option. 
---
Saw some days ago a poor fella which try to sell inert for ~1.000 cps...
---
I agree...that's actually what I do at my job, I'm in the background... operations...and if I do my job well, we all win....I'll gladly help in the background...one problem is though the conduit is really a deathblow to a low level...but I try, and try....and try!
---
I would rather them fix the servers than give us Paradise... I‚Äôve tried the event 10 times. 4 failures due to idiots &amp; 6 crashes...
---
Gotta find an empty usb to transfer them.
---
Better than letting it spoil, take it to the vendor if u don't sell by the expiration time
---
Would you be able to dm me the spoilers from the weapon mod description in challenges? If you have the time I‚Äôd be curious to see
---
That‚Äôs interesting... I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. Aiming is really my issue and I didn‚Äôt like the changes with VATs in 76 so I just went melee only, but I may or may not have over 20 perks points sitting around to spend so maybe I‚Äôll try that and see if it works for me. Thanks for the idea and the support!
---
Maybe they're more interested in paranormal/cryptid related discoveries than they let on. There could have been an angle like that for what they were trying to accomplish in Point Lookout too, looking for natural gas at civil war burial sites. Something like Dunwich Borers.
---
Removing PvP won't change the fact that explosive laser weapons are literally rule breaking to the game itself. I've only ever held an explosive flamer and I DID get rid of it long ago because it felt weird holding that broken.
---
I love it so much!
---
Rose. No one else would fit better.
---
Listening to fonv soundtrack while playing, specificly "big iron" gives you a plus 10 awesome rating.
---
In my humble opinion, if you're super attached to your mutations then SG is a must have...any number of things can remove your mutation...even just organic timeline.
---
Probably one of the best mutations to have but it does Lower Chem efficiency by 50%
---
I knew there were other people like me out there. I also need help on the silo run.
---
You only need one piece for the effect.   But if you run full unyielding plus sneak 3 you won‚Äôt need chameleon for PVE.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR2YSNQQrTY&amp;t=741s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR2YSNQQrTY&amp;t=741s) 
---
Go to about the 2:00 minute mark for a demo of sneak ability with all chameleon compared to just one piece, or none.  I always thought one piece of chameleon was the same as two or three...so I just used one piece along with unyeilding.  Now I'm going to experiment.
---
No. You should only have to put them on and go to the Sergeant upstairs. If need be, get a new set of fatigues and helmet out of the machine by finding that voucher. Then there will be a quest marker on them. Go to the sergeant and he should recognize you as he as having already completed it. If not, switch servers. This happened to me as well and this is how I resolved it.
---
Easy there, sport! First we get the topiaries for 500 atoms each.
---
What would happen if i just changed the images to well porn with the same filenames
---
I got it yesterday.
---
On that note, how much should I realistically expect to pay for a aae radium?  I have a 1 star AA but I want a little more DPS with the explosive effect on it I think.
---
Golf clubs and boards so far. And a stalkers shovel.
---
Yes! I love playing with people like you. I‚Äôm not bad with my tools. I‚Äôve actually taken down a pair of level 50 SBs on my own!
---
FEV.
---
I like to think of it as my characters are working together. Each specializing in their own thing but trading and selling among themselves. It's not changing bodies, it's just changing which character I am controlling in my multi character story of the wasteland.
---
Yes, ive totally thought about this. And actually, it seems power armor tends to fuse to its user when said user dies, so extra explanation not really required. But even just random chance of recovering a piece of the armor would be nice. Could pair nicely with another idea I had, Legendary power armor.
---
Thanks for bringing this up. This actually ties into a general tip that I didn‚Äôt think about adding. Most of the time walls will try to follow the direction of other walls above or below it, so removing those let‚Äôs you freely rotate it.
---
Thanks man
---
Definitely
---
Totally. I think Bethesda should really look into the whole Event Loot system and make it equitable. Especially because Events are the best repeatable group PvE content in this game so far. Getting in on Events with other people is fun and good. I've been lucky. I've only had people swarm on the legendary target for my event without letting me tag it one time. It was the first time I ran the event so I didn't know what to expect. It was disappointing. Letting griefers one shot boss mobs and deny other players of their well earned loot is bad, but I'm just repeating what we all already know to be true.
---
Encountered alien solo on my way through the woods heading to Berkeley springs station. Surprised the hell out of me as I was wandering solo.
---
I completed it. I had done all that and everything else. But oh well
---
Lead is generally a bad idea to have in contact with your person.
---
That's kinda my point. I feel like the way the old Fallouts were meant to be played I should have ~7 characters around lvl50 than a single god tier character that can change classes on a whim. I'm noticing the respecs are way more common on survival games though, and I guess this is more of a survival game than an RPG like older Fallouts.
---
Heck... I hope i can fill the vault shelf someday with my past quest memorabilia
---
Oh nooooo! I‚Äôm on XB1. Boo. Also, I‚Äôm a woman, so I‚Äôm probably just reinforcing stereotypes with this post. But yeah, I probably need to find a friend to play with.
---
I'd be OK with this, provided the cost isn't a ridiculous amount of caps.
---
Level 3 super duper procs a lot it seriously seems like at least 50% of the time if not higher. Total points in luck does not mater.
---
Luck will not effect legendary drops that is totally rng
---
Pray to the RNG gods we all do and maybe you'll get something good.
---
That said having point in luck is important.
---
You know about Super Duper
---
Serendipity (No PA) is awesome. 
---
Starched genes a must for muties you won't lose your mutations from rad away or gain unwanted mutations.
---
Class Freak negate 75% of negative mutation effects yeah a must for Muties
---
Bloody Mess nothing wrong with an all around +15% damage boost.
---
Pharma Pharma low on chems and Stimpaks? This will help
---
Can collector Dog food is a common find. You like good doggy you need this. Every trash can is a potential can of food.
---
Cap collector. Like caps? Now you can "search" cap stashes for more. Learn the cap stash locations and enjoy an over abundance of caps
---
One Gun Army. Are you a heavy gunner? Yeah you'll like this card enemy mobs can't attack when thier staggered and crippled.
---
Scrounger more ammo yes I'll take some
---
And many more. Best part most of these perks can be swapped out when you don't need them. Your not always going to be farming for caps, cans or chems.
---
I like to do a WS run with Pharma Pharma on my first loop. Second loop can collector, 3rd loop scrounger. 
---
Need something to kill time while your waiting for the mods to respawn? Use Cap Collector WS has a ton of caps stashes. They're everywhere.
---
TL;DR Luck perks are pretty damn good.
---
They go by really fast. Like, "blink and you'll miss it" fast.
---
Just because a carryweight Liberty is taken for gameplay doesn‚Äôt mean that gun weight is allowed to be ludicrous
---
I gotcha
---
Oh alright didn't know that, fair point.
---
When ever I clear or go to low level area I use melee or low level gun because I know what it feels like to lose exp and loot suddenly
---
Every time I play that character I do.
---
Gave my scrip for this: [https://imgur.com/nkuXnrW](https://imgur.com/nkuXnrW)
---
Cool huh?
---
They were late because their ghoul CAMPS couldn't be loaded
---
24/7 my friend, 24/7
---
There's a perfect spot just a little north of the monorail lift, a radioactive crater that looks like one of the original bomb impacts. Keep a shower in there to clean you up from the residual rads and you've got a perfect fast travel location with zero competition and great flat building area
---
Thanks. Which location do you prefer?
---
Sure, you can probably solo it if you‚Äôve got a min/max build like bloody unarmed. For those of us who haven‚Äôt, it‚Äôs very much a team event.
---
wasted hours of farming just to auto scrap. thanks bethesda real smart.
---
Yeah...  I am responsible for over a dozen of those so...  sorry!  Took awhile to learn to grab only 1 pylon.
---
The other day I tried to open the door to the whitespring train station and it was just barren ground inside I stayed for probably a full minute nothing loaded
---
If you are level 50+ try the project paradise event. Should be a good spot to get it done.
---
I‚Äôve had the same issue, and when it happens, especially after a hard slog, it‚Äôs enough to make a preacher cuss!
---
I always have my Genes on. Sorry, bad pun, couldn't resist it. I've been to similar camps where a set up similar to this occurs. But due to the fact I use a lot of radaway in nuke zones I need starched genes on permanently. Plus having it on gives the added protection that when I accidentally take Rad-x, which happen more than I'd like to admit, I only get a time out from my mutations and get to roam as the fresh out of the vault dwellers used to, ahhh memories. Never been inclined to take that perk off, same with class freak.
---
The aren‚Äôt against the rules, obviously.   They just no longer drop.  And why is an explosive laser beam any less reasonable than an explosive railway rifle.   Moreover, in PVE my Bloodied Explosive lever is far more deadly than my Bloodied Explosive laser.    They are only an issue to those who feel they are ‚Äúunfair‚Äù in PVP.   But why should PVE rules change to accommodate the minority that PVP?
---
In CS:GO trading, people trade keys ($2.5), vanilla knives ($80-$200), and a few high-tiers ($500-2000, mostly doppler gems and dragon lores/medusas/howls/etc) to avoid the 1000 item inventory limit. The keys have a stable value, the other items do not but tend to stay within the same rough area over time. Everything except the cheapest of skins is priced in terms of keys because of how stable they are. The issue here is that there's room for massive inflation due to how easy it is to get scrip and how in its current state any desirable legendaries will eventually become cheap and common. I think the only way people can establish an alternate currency is what has already sort of happened, trading very high demand legendaries that have not been duped to hell as a somewhat stable form of currency
---
Glad to hear it
---
That‚Äôs so weird! I noticed it the other day in some rando cabin or something! The tables were gone, but the stuff usually on them was still there, just floating.
---
I didn't get it either despite taking/reading/playing all Ansel's items
---
Recipes needed for the cooking badge can be bought at Whitesprings for 100. I sell them for 300, not quickly but then I hae volume sellers that re my bread and butter. I also found a few plans and items with consistant spawns as a nice icing on the cake. One item I sell every day or two for 900 caps.
---
Oh. Scout camp is fine
---
Well I'm not saying I'm that guy but I think I'm that guy. I have a bar base with tents for people to rest, crafting garage, and a decontamination shower area which I've seen people spawn at when they fast travel. Not all the time but it happens
---
I always thought they should have a "lost loot" stash/vendor. While you should always be able to loot it yourself sometimes glitches prevent you from doing it. But it's also a survival game so idk. Example if you kill a 3 star ghoul and a troll granades it off a cliff, you should have to track the body down.  But when an imposter sheepsquash body disappears and 80% of the players fighting it can't find it that's a problem.
---
So there should be a shash or vendor you can retrieve non picked up items.  Now I know people might take advantage of this, let's kill everything and never pick anything up so we wont be over encumbered and we will go get everything later. So to stop that, limit it to something like you can only take out 1 item per hour and everything in there disappears forever after 1 hour. This gives you time to contribute looting/finishing the current quest or event you're on. Then you have time to go to the shash or vendor to get the 3 star you lost. You notice theres 2 3 stars and a 2 star in that shash. I can only get one? This sucks. Yeah I guess it does but at least you have the choice.
---
Of course there would have to be an explanation.  Look at one of the first comments on this post.  Guy thought it wouldnt be feasible because in a PA suit you have a mask that prevent airborne diseases.  In this game it seems you have to explain everything or someone will complain online about it.  Plus itll be something cool to add to the lore.
---
Mmmm call me bby
---
This has been my complaint, I just don‚Äôt see the logic in assuming one deserves something, then actively being needy or aggressive and begging for or demanding it. You can put the question out there, but no need to blow your top or turn into a petulant child.
---
Re starting game. Couldn't find you in social.
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
Actually, you‚Äôre more right than you might think. According to the Fallout gamepedia and the terminals in Van Lowe Taxidermy, evidently the Imposter was meant to cause a string of Sheepsquatch sightings and cause property values to plummet/citizens to flee the area out of fear, allowing Bysshe to buy out all the land in Lewisburg.
---
Doesn't matter if they are legendary, matters if they were the crowned "leader" when the event started. If it has a crown, let it live as long as possible until you're done with the event.
---
Hey, they run sort of stable on PC...after a dozen technical fixes and patches...
---
Lol I do the same thing. I just went melee build so the gun stats dont make me so tilted. Im only a mild gun enthusiast and I know how wrong Fo76 gun stats are.
---
My suppressor auto Tesla works great for just that reason.
---
Of course, I've had this happen to me, and I've done this. I did this the other day during One Violent Night. Sometimes I just get so wrapped up in killing things as quickly as possible, that I forget to switch to a less powerful weapon.  
---
I think you're always going find folks who are forgetful, or are just dicks, but it's worth remembering how more frequently folks are cool. I'm just continuously amazed at how often the opposite happens, where someone will wave me over to give damage to a three star that I wasn't even aware of. 
---
It's one of the reasons I love AWOL Armaments; seems like the event always ends with everyone gathered around the final three star Mister Gutsy, making sure everyone gets a shot.
---
I need a pet moth someday. Or a Moth needs a pet human and i'm in luck to be chosen.
---
Great for when the queen lands, slows her down while the melee lads do their thing. I always take my 2shot cryolator to the queen fight.
---
Sent! Let me know when you're online, and feel free to FT to my camp. There's a nice shallow beach for the challenge
---
Oh wow how benevolent
---
Doesnt work because aomething else is there 51.
---
Remember to pay it back after you level up. Helping new vaulties is a bit of a community tradition.
---
I think the way to go about implementing that- since these items are craft or event drop only- is to add a new option to the Purveyor where you can give a non-legendary item legendary effects.
---
Yeah, 20 pounds if ludicrous for a rifle. And if its kilos well then goddamn we have all been eating our wheeties
---
I was going to add a comment about Class Freak, but it wasn't too the point.  I used Junk Shield forever, but that's a thing of the past now.  It's a shame we can't sell/trade perk cards.
---
....why not just monitor what you're selling and how many caps you have?
---
it's only level 21, the poor little bug.
---
Wasnt lies though
---
Everyone submitting a score takes a screenshot or records their game and submits it at the end of the event. I keep track of them all in a google doc.
---
It would be great!
---
Agree but no clue how they would track that
---
Looking forward to it!
---
Completely agree, and add in a re-balance patch as well!
---
Reminds me of the glory days of FONV, and smacking geckos with a shovel just because I didn't want to waste ammo.
---
Bethesda is incapable of creating even a barely usable keybinding, why do you think they'd be able to employ such ancient magic?
---
They don't drop because they don't work as intended. Again I point to the flamer. Why should a flamethrower shoot like a mini gun?  I think op listed off other problems that laser weapons have. It may matter LESS in pve because damn near any gun is viable after lvl 50 against mobs but then why bother having varience in weapons at all?  Should we all just run around with lever actions explosive lasers and handmades?  Weapons should have strong points and weak points.
---
I play with a large group on PS4 but we are always looking for good folks to play with, we tag and share all our stuff it makes the game more fun. PSN is SURLY1982
---
So a 3* weapon roll at purveyor for 100k? U can't be serious.
---
Same icon as on here
---
They can farm in other places, this event needs people who actually help
---
I thought it was a quiet kind of land grab, what with the quick transfer of the shop whilst his sister was out, and their apparent interest in the area. The people would want to gtfo of Dodge when their livestock started dying, the holdouts mayhap come across it themselves. Then there would be the eventual tourism of a Sheepsquatch that no hunter would be able to take down. Calvin's belief was giving them a realistic model, and if it actually panned out genuine cryptid DNA, bonus.
---
But then I read everyone else's ideas and think, I'm probably wrong. I mean, *someone* thought making the Grafton Monster was a good idea.
---
Yup, SG is mandatory once you have the desired  mutations. Never remove it.
---
I have given close to 100 stimpacks away in 2 weeks lately to low levels :D
---
They can seek revenge, so if that's what you want like I do then good, if you're a non pvper though it may put you in a bad spot
---
I‚Äôve got a maxed out bloodied melee and a maxed out bloodied rifle build. I kinda want something new but I‚Äôm so spoiled by all the special points
---
Cheers. Not great news, but cheers for the responseüëç
---
Yeah I mainly use rifles so I‚Äôll make sure I get some damage on her in the air and then when she hits the ground I want to make sure the melee guys do work!
---
They are all different.  And the mechanics of each are fun.   As to PVE being easy:   I one shot LVL 62. Ghouls will a 1* bloodied rolling pin.   Of course it is easy.  But it is fun playing with as many weapon types as possible.
---
Your time will come.
---
Maybe if the vault raids were proper raids all would wish they have a good medic by their side.
---
As my teams medic bloodied builds make my skin crawl lol.
---
Vendors only give me two for it
---
Nah, that'd be super easy to program. The trash mobs are tied to spawn with whatever main enemy boss for the event. You can track killing those or tagging those just as easily as the 1 main.
---
If loot quality is using a formula based on amount of damage done during an event, even that could be tracked easily, down to the exact amount of HP any player gets credit for.
---
Hell, I‚Äôm still using my one star anti-armor Gatling as my main weapon. Thing‚Äôs my favorite weapon
---
That's on you.
---
They used to sound terrifying until I tried it. Started with a rifle build but my bloodied melee feels like an actual superhero
---
Never had this glitch. Could you put some carpet or rug over it?
---
Please for the love of Atom include the log cabin building set as well as interior walls and/or wallpaper!
---
Ignoring the potential loss of mutations, mandatory showers are annoying AF for a bloodied build. I work hard to keep my rads at the perfect level to activate nerd rage, and I don't want your stupid shower fucking that up. I've encountered several camps that have these set ups, and every time I encounter it I just throw some angry emotes (if the owner is home), and leave without buying anything.
---
I've had a big problem with playing an event (fasnacht)  and lvl 100 people ending the legendary enemy before I can even blink, it's not fun at all
---
&gt; Long leash to run
---
As evidenced by the hints at robo-bestaility in the logs...
---
I'd be happy to forget that one...
---
Yeah, the community's pretty cool, one of the best i've ever actually been a part of. Hell, someone gave me directions to a place I needed to go the other day.
---
You the real MVP, it was awesome getting introduced to a game like that.
---
The ratios I mentioned are examples for illustration purposes. The actual exchange rate would be settled by the community and economy.
---
Although I would like this, people could abuse it by pricing stuff they don't want in their stash, but still want to keep, at 25k caps.
---
Of course! The only real upgrade for you is an AA fire rate or explosive Gatling. People drastically underestimate the value of a good 1 star in making life easier.
---
Honestly I am not even against the leaderboard, just the part where you show up on the map.
---
Shovel knight build.
---
Adamantium limbs a necessity.
---
OMG the entitlement of this post... If I can I'll let you get yours in uranium fever but if im low health/ high rads and im in his swing range I'm putting a full clip in him and wont even think twice. Are you my teammate? Then it's not my job to look after you. Git gud as all the cool kids say.
---
i just server hop 98 NAR for 10 minutes when i start playing and i'm good for 2 days.
---
The challenge for Night Light is "take a picture in **Stormy** weather", it doesn't have to be a rad storm. I managed to do it fairly quickly by fast traveling to 76, climbing to the top of the lighthouse, and using a scoped rifle to look for storm clouds and get a sense of where it was. After that it was just a matter of traveling there and taking a picture.  
---
Also, if anyone on xbox wants it and doesn't want to do the challenge I have it in a vending machine for 1k.
---
Pretty sure they're just copied straight from fo4, so it makes sense they use the same lines. The mutants are a bit more intelligent and developed in the first two fallout games, and they say similar things in dialogue/recordings there. One of the bad endings of fallout 1 is getting yourself dipped in green stuff by the mutants :)
---
Nice job!  As a West Virginia native, it always makes me feel proud when I see our state portrayed in a positive light!
---
It's the sole reason I carry one and I don't equip my damage perks.
---
110% agreed
---
No idea. Prices vary wildly, I would ballpark under 5k. could be wrong.
---
Agreed to all, and let me just state im very good at pvp with my semi auto build, very few stand a chance. This post is not the result of getting bullied it's the result of it feels more like deathmatch than survival. Pinpoint locations condemns you to death.
---
I gave a level 5 quad pump action to a newbie the other day. It got me through some tough fights and I couldn‚Äôt bear to break it down for scrip.
---
We really appreciate that!
---
Think about it, we're tried to recreate your country... but we live in italy, funny uh?
---
weird. i sell my staff w/ mods from 199-449 caps...
---
I think it will be a nice addition hopefully it will have in game use
---
Ok, but think about, what would you pay in caps for 3* weapon roll? Imo 1000c would be much, because you have players vending and market to just buy the gun you want.
---
Enjoy your backpack!
---
But I need my fix man
---
Healing Factor is similar to health regen armor. Combine HF with Sunkissed perk, get rid of rads during day and restore health.
---
Can I get your legendary syringer for free?
---
Message the other players who were in the nuke zones and see if they'll buy your flux or sell you any of the stabilizers to make your own.
---
Haha I feel like a superhero because Ive got full life saving armor, healing factor, Team medic 3 shared with my team, and every stim related perk there is. Im not very strong, nor is my DR crazy high, but god damn am I still hard to kill. My favorite is when an enemy downs me, and turns around while I get back to my feet and start bashing them in the back of the head with my Vamp 40% speed war drum.
---
Oh it‚Äôs all totally made up pricing. I‚Äôve just found I get quicker buys at a slightly lower price. From grinding the event so often I have over 50 sheepsquatch horns to make into weapons so I‚Äôm just trying to flip fast
---
Message them. I always get messages for the minigame I added to my camp and my indoor pool lol. I love getting the messages and sharing tips
---
I‚Äôve got my shop up on the 2nd floor over my locked ground floor. In the locked area I have a few razor grains and two ground water pumps so I‚Äôve always got something, along with my generators. 
---
2nd floor is my four vending machines, every workbench, a couple beds and musical instruments and two stash boxes. I keep my decontamination shower under the stairs leading up to the public area so there‚Äôs no accidental radaway-ing.
---
Outside there‚Äôs two industrial water purifiers and a small vegetable garden with ‚Äúfree water/free food‚Äù vaultboy signs.
---
All in all I‚Äôm happy with my setup and have gotten some compliments on how inviting it is
---
Because frankly every time we go down there the pleebs who can‚Äôt follow directions spend more time killing things than filling troughs or protecting Fluffy.  Less enemies, less distractions.  I‚Äôd rather win the event 3/3 than walk out with 4 1* legendaries.
---
It's weird because my stability is also. I never disconnect or crash anymore so it's odd that some people are.
---
I want to see. Platform?
---
PERFECT.  I thank you sir or ma‚Äôam.
---
I hope Bethesda finally gives us a personal bank so that we can exchange items with our own characters on our account. I have T-45, T-5, excavator and T-60 on my 1st character and would love to give it to my level 26 new character.
---
I saw one guy selling 2mm for 10 each. Another guy was selling holotapes for 10 caps. *Holotapes*. Not even the games or anything
---
Xbox. I'm not at home ATM and don't have screenshots of this place but I'll comment again when I get a chance to upload some pics
---
Along with that, i hate in burrows when a legendary falls through metal grated walkways into water below and i cant get.
---
Maybe you guys need better internet connection because I literally never crash or disconnect.
---
I bet. I played during the beta, so i wasnt introduced to the game like that. At least the community is friendly for the most part
---
Moot point. PlayStation here. Pics would be great.
---
Two shot and explosive each give +25% damage, the difference is that the explosive damage can be boosted with demo expert, while two shot can't be boosted by anything.
---
I might add you to my friends list when I get home. If I remember. I have no friends... IGN: Voidforged
---
I suppose it depends on the value of the weapon. Many players pay much more for ideal rolls.
---
A full set of meta armor well exceeds cap limit value. At the moment, players can only trade 5 items for items of equal value- in high value trades this becomes a very narrow market. There is a need for another medium of value, a different currency between caps and weapons/armor. I'm just putting Scrip forward as a suggestion to fill that gap.
---
I think you internet connection sucks to be honest.
---
Broadsiders are the redheaded stepchild of heavy weapons. 
---
They fire slower than my grandmother crosses the street (shes in her 90s)
---
They don't get the benefit of Heavy Gunner perks (60% of your damage with heavies)
---
They are heavies so VATS is a no go (Heavies and VATS go together like Ketchup and steak)
---
Ultimately, its a great weapon for screwing around, but if your going into a serious fight  you are better off with a .50, Gatling Plasma, Minigun or Gatling Laser (ive never been a fan of the slow ass gatling gun)
---
Heavy Gunner PA builds are powerful, but you need to be very picky in your weapon choices.  They are great for PVE content (some of the highest DPS in game is from PA Heavies) but if you are looking for a survival mode build, you are better off with rifles and VATS crits since Heavies rely on PA to be as effective as they should be.  Heavies are really only viable in survival if you are rolling with a crew.
---
Yo, there is a solution to the wire/jump problem!  On PC, at least, if you are jumping instead of attaching, you can use E to connect your wire where it goes.  Even though E is labeled for something else, if you have the wire in your hands it will attach it.  Don't have to leave build mode and start wire over.
---
You can but it always reverts to 1* after logging out... Never max out daily scrip before visiting the vendor.
---
Do you by chance know the confirmed glitched challenges that cant be completed right now? I know musician and herpetologist but by chance you know the rest?
---
It doesn't make a noise? Some of the global alerts we have make a hell of alot of noise and linger on the screen far longer than welcome.
---
It isn't an exaggeration, it is a valid comparison to things that also beg for our attention and don't get it because we grow calous to things that beg our attention when we do not want to give it.
---
A toggle to turn this off is not too much to ask
---
I can, but it does not fit my layout
---
That....suuuuuucccckkkks.
---
lol I‚Äôd say about 90% or so of my player kills (both in adv and survival) have been with a 1* Anti-armor handmade...
---
For the MILLIONTH fucking time these are blog posts written up by a marketing rep, stop expecting them to address shit like this.
---
Oh, sorry you got me wrong. I meant, at the purveyor roll the dice for a 3* weapon.
---
I call bull on the fusion core being number one I have yet to find someone who sells them and I damn near go to every camp
---
I've been starched since setting up my mutations, never take it off.
---
Yeah that makes sense.  And maybe this event just has a steeper learning curve. I'm fine with that.  My only concern is whether or not the event is working correctly and is free of bugs. But for now, I will  assume that it is working correctly until future patch notes indicate otherwise.
---
freeaim no vats
---
So you can't fast track the challenges. Stretches them out a bit longer and forces more work.
---
Ya. Same with 7600 hours on Appalachia. You Andy get 20 atoms for that. It should at least be 1000
---
JFC dude, it's been ~48 hours since it went live, and given the fact that it's not happening consistently I'm sure it's taking them some time to diagnose and fix the issue.
---
Well I picked up an a 1*  lvl 40 anti armour hunting rifle and been one shoting lvl 68 ghouls with it can‚Äôt wait to be blessed with an instigating version
---
No I filled out the form and got the email that it was accepted months ago but that's the last I heard of it, not really worried too much about it I was fine with the first bag , but if they were gonna give me a free one that's fine too
---
Bloodied builds should have healing factor, marsupial, grounded (if you don‚Äôt do energy weapons), twisted muscles (if you like melee), and speed demon. Optional: Bird Bones and Eagle Eyes.
---
yeah. They drive the market out of existance so no one can make any caps from them!
---
Amazing job killing the market! MVP for sure!
---
Same here. XB1.
---
It was one of the best rewards I ever got for the event....followed by having the game crash on me twice each time during the event x)
---
Try wearing BOS armor or PA around Phoenix out in Watoga.
---
When I showed up in a vault suit he said something about getting rid of that blue suit and getting a real uniform.
---
That's why I always try to chuck a grenade early on just to make sure I get credit at tbe end. You're right, though, everyone involved should get presents. üéÅ
---
On another note I pay for the fastest internet available. Could this be why I don't experience these problems?
---
Explosive gives +20%
---
Healing Factor is great for gaining health after a fight, saves loads of Stimpaks over time in this way. But it helps not at all during combat. 
---
For this reason I use a Vampire Lever for SQB and this works very well. The Vampire keeps my health up as various creatures attack and Healing Factor is useless. 
---
I  was just testing something else and removed all mutations. I saw no evidence that Healing Factor affects the Vampire effect either way. Its healing rate seemed just the same without the mutation.
---
Don‚Äôt eat the brown acid!
---
I have an XB1 S
---
Ok well during your 4 hour stream do the arkos event a few times see if you still feel the same
---
That sounds like a pretty good idea.
---
Is this s/? If their big announcement for E3 is they added the new weapons to the legendary table id be very disappointed. That seems like an obvious thing and not much of an announcement.
---
Don't remove them from the legendary pool give them the legendary slots!
---
I played w him on one attempt. Our Mirelurk attacked the lvl100 Sheepsquatch... to fail the event.
---
Marsupial and Speed Demon are my two biggest sellers, but Adrenal Reaction and Twisted Muscles sell OK too.
---
They only appear for you once you have one, after getting the quest.  So you can have extras with lenses.
---
I think this sub forgets just how different each persons setup is. 
---
Just cause it isn't happening to you, doesn't mean it isn't happening man. 
---
I don't experience half the stuff that gets reported here either, but I'm not about to come on here and essentially say all these people are making it up or whatever this is going for.
---
Same here, right around Charleston station, but I had to jump out of the PA and try him a second time before he recognized the paramedic jumpsuit.
---
Turn your vendor off
---
Bro! They need to take that leaderboard system off, for reals.  It‚Äôs obnoxious having anyone appear out of nowhere and making your death certain without any chance of being able to fight back.
---
No. They dont. SOME melee weapons with SOME legendary effects and the right build to match it are 1 hit SOMETIMES. Same with ranged..
---
I unlocked my water purifiers for people to take what they need. And I have stuff planted for people to take. If you w taken any of mine, thank you, at least I know they‚Äôre being used üòÅ
---
I think if more than one person tags the radstag, they both get the meat. So that‚Äôs a way of increasing it.
---
Id rather make 100 caps a piece in my vendor. Don't worry, it's by the flatwoods so noobs can visit me for a bargain...
---
You're right, but but my larger point still stands. Explosive can be buffed significantly using demo expert, while TS doesn't benefit from any perks.
---
The title ‚Äúwastelanders‚Äù would imply npcs which I‚Äôm hopeful for
---
I drop care packages(ammo,stimpacks, disease cure) @Vault 76 to help them get started in the wasteland
---
I'm not sure if there are other ways to do it, but "sliding objects" (I always thought of it as changing the placement "depth") can be done on PC using the scroll wheel.
---
Bet.
---
How is that on me? They still operate even when not powered.
---
Flatwoods monster is basically an alien i guess
---
I have 100 in my vendor and 230 on me lol
---
The purveyor took it
---
I lost mine once and immediately adjusted a few things so I could run SG full time. 
---
Didn't even bother getting mutes on my alt until I hit 32 and had it equipped.
---
Got the recipes I need on the main if I do lose em, but still kind of a pain, just rather know its not gonna happen.
---
Taking away the initial 1 you have in special you have used 38 special points at level up. Are you level 39 when you took this photo?
---
No you
---
You're correct. The first loot bag stays until you (or someone else) grabs it, or you pick up more junk and die again. At that point your first loot bag disappears and is replaced by a new one with the new junk you picked up.
---
I crash roughly once an hour almost like a timer sometimes 6 times in an hour I guess it depends hahaha
---
Why doesn‚Äôt Walmart only carry 10 items at a time?
---
For general all purpose, Bloodied should never be the go to.  Bloodied builds are superpowerful, but also super squishy (dont get hit), best used on a team for end game bulletsponges.  Since you are looking for a full health build, this is out. 
---
AAE will be  your best all around followed by TSE if you are looking at semi auto.
---
If you are looking at an auto handmade Furious Explosive would be  your best option. 
---
For a sniper semi auto build, look into Instigating Explosive.
---
Third star should be fire rate, or DR when aiming.
---
Ah so it's yet another bugged challenge -_- I first figured it would be any storm which are plenty and I have taken 12 camera pictures both in and 5 of a thunderstorm and even tried couple photomode pics and each in different servers in different play times. Never worked. It sucks how half of my challenges are bugged and most people don't. Like gardener for example haven't accepted any plantings and crafting metal armor does nothing :/
---
thought I cought a steal at 2700
---
Inert is pretty heavy tho
---
True facts and fair point.
---
Also your agility for the tadpole challenges can be increased by chems or other effects to make the required 5.  What does your special page on the pip boy look like?
---
Right! And it doesn't matter what the item was because it could have been sold in my machine, scripted, or given to a friend. It's just disheartening going to a horde and knowing there will be a legendary only to get nothing. And it's not the first time this has happened, but it was one of the few times I had actually seen it disappear in front of me. Other times I thought it was just the server catching up.
---
Still works without power.
---
Its weird cause one of them said it last night outside of West-Tek...was like where else you talkin about Mutant buddy? Guessing the instance inside is probably the only place they won't say it.
---
Agree 100%
---
Source: me, heavy gunner
---
I don't think it's made up but I don't understand what's going on. I hear people on all platforms complaining about it.
---
I was going to turn it in for scrip so...
---
I‚Äôve done that event 4 times now and never crashed. I dunno man.
---
I use my Laser frequently, I will just cease fire at the last like 2-5% hp so the burn damage keeps going, but someone else gets the final hit.
---
It was that, and like another poster said, he was going to use the impostor to lure out the real one via mating calls and stuff.  A couple notes reference doing it, and when he accidentally activated the bot he was trying to upload the reproductive subroutines.
---
No but people complain as if it is a wide spread problem that everyone experiences. Every other "I finally tried 76 and it isn't nearly as bad as everyone claims"  post kind of proves people talk as if everyone is having these problem.  
---
and when someone pops up saying that it isn't universal people respond like you have making mild assumptions about someone pointing out the problems are not wide spread.
---
As I stated in the title it's more of a gimmick character. I ultimately decided to invest a lot into melee as a primary form of damage and the broadsider as a secondary. I also planning on grabbing the heavy gunner perk cards to be able to swap to other heavy weapons for queen fights.
---
I don't really have much of any interest in survival in its current state. I tried to play it for a while with my vats rifleman but it was just too dang easy to kill people. I know a lot of people really get their kicks from survival but I just don't understand the appeal. And are you sure about the fire rate being slow? My quad one goes bananas when I spam the trigger.
---
Thanks. I will add you as soon as I log in :)
---
Player X is bad at survival/PVP does not follow from Player X attacks in adventure mode.
---
I've done it a few times and have never crashed once. I'm not sure what's going on and how so many people are experiencing these thing but I swear it's not happening to me.
---
I just found jeterday one an have made pic's kf it while fighting but i diden't konw that this Canlenge exsists üò≠
---
I just did the responders stuff at the time and dropped the outfit off in my stash, when he said scan failed i ran to the station and equipped my responders uniform!
---
Also, maybe dumb question but how did you get that responder thingy after your name
---
for everyone in here any ballistic ammo (not ultracite) should go for 1 cap per. if you charge more, you are a monster :(
---
I had a new purchase show up named to match a completely different item. New LMG became piece of armor...
---
Check your items carefully it‚Äôs there I bet
---
If same server it's still there unless u picked up new loot or someone took it but if they did u would be notified
---
You don't learn the "recipe" for fixing the camera until you find the tourist and start the quest. You also can't drop, sell or trade cameras, so it's not possible to help other people.
---
Peek bullshit
---
Had it happen to me. Thought..."this looks like a freaky game of Twister."
---
There has to be something thats making people crash though. Maybe it's some sort of items or quest sequence that is bugged that certain people do.
---
Fellow lone wolf looking to join a nice pack
---
PSN is ZacBarton_
---
I‚Äôm using it with longshoremans and slicker hat , ... look like BigBird,..ü§£
---
And the buff goes straight into your HP bar with every single close-range shot, which can result in suicide even with max Fireproof and Dense mods
---
I tried to kill the Imposter with my 2 friends and man they spawn a LOT a crazy insane amount of ‚Äúmobs‚Äù I kept dying we gave up because the game keeps glitching out our stimpaks please Bethesda fix that issue and that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt even tried to do the Paradise Event yet and increase our camp build budget so we can build a cool camp while having the necessities and turrents
---
I appreciate the help man.
---
I wouldn't say "bugged", it's just finicky about defining stormy weather. I took a few while it was clearly raining and nothing happened, so I followed the storm until I got close to the center and the lightning was flashing on top of my. Pointed up, clicked the shutter, and "ta da!"
---
Well, you did a great job of recreating it!  If you ever get the chance, you all are welcome anytime in West Virginia!
---
My buddy found one at 200. But then I also found a high capacity mod for 990 so I'm feeling good about it haha
---
GG bro
---
Praise Atom, this is great information!  My favorite tip is the one about placing conduits next to each other and wiring them, then moving them further apart to stretch the wire over distance.  Could have come in handy last night when I was trying to run power to the extractors at Poisidon after powering it up!
---
Well to be fair there are actually 5.56 AKs for the civilian market (saiga and Bulgarian models), super reliable just like traditional AK.
---
99% of the people into now are pretty polite. Everyone waits for people to tag a legendary and I try to do my part by helping out new guys.
---
I was thinking about this too. Itd be cool if you could use scrip to upgrade weapons. Pay for the star rating and get a random effect like with the legendary vendor now. Maybe we would get those 4th and 5th stars this way too.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôm looking for a 3* .38 pipe weapon!
---
I have the exact same problem right now and do not know how to fix it. It is really annoying cause I want to trade but I can't. I think it started happening only a couple of hours ago.
---
It can only be activated during the feeding phase.
---
I have opened a chat, let me know there
---
Here's my many pictures I've taken from Start to Plat, curated so I didn't have many more pictures to sort through.

This. If they were like a level 30, sure maybe they don‚Äôt understand how legendaries work. At higher levels, you know everyone else needs to get a hit in for the drop.
---
You're not my brother, I don't even know you!
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm glad that people can find this useful
---
Man, it would be awesome!
---
Do you have enough space in your home for a troupe of 30 italians?
---
Hell I killed a 3\* earlier and it literally dropped no legendaries. That was pretty sweet.
---
Wahhhh
---
If your character is not in danger (hidden or caution) you can move right in front of a PvE enemy, undetected and punch it to death....in this case, why is more than 1 chameleon piece necessary, even if it does stack?
---
The only two scenarios I can think of when multiple pieces of Chameleon armor could be beneficial is to employ the Escape Artist perk (use sneak to lose enemies). Does the transition from danger to hidden/caution may work better with multiple chameleon armor pieces? Or during PvP, attain same level of invisibility when crouched as when using a steal boy.
---
Isn‚Äôt it like 0.2?
---
Still looking for others if you‚Äôre interested!
---
I accidentally completed the photograph every NPC type challenge. There was an alien on that list, and I can assure you the Flatwoods Monster is the only thing I photographed that even remotely resembles an alien!
---
Alrighty!
---
I bulk everything and sell to vendors any junk i have more than 5 bulk of (unless its steel lead cloth or acid for bullets)
---
For non bulkable, more than 50 is excess unless its something you are storing for building a camp or PA suits
---
Screws and springs you should never get rid of, you use these for everything.
---
most of the rest is super easy to get, or not needed for most stuff. 
---
If you run into a resource you need, go farm it till you are done building, then you can forget about that unneeded resource again. 
---
Hoarding is a hard thing to get over, once you figure out what you need regularly you can then get rid of all the stuff you dont use. 
---
Like silver and gold, who uses silver and gold (other than X01 builders)?
---
Check your Misc tab, there are some things there that can weigh you down
---
Gunpowder takes up a lot of weight too, try to keep stock in acid and cloth instead, its much more weight friendly than a giant stack of gunpowder.   
---
Ores also take up a lot of weight and should be smelted regularly to get the lighter bulkable scraps.
---
Meds can weigh down your stash without you realizing it because perks like Traveling Pharma and Thru Hiker dont impact your stash.  What might weigh .01 in your backpack might be a pound or more in your stash (found this out the hard way, now I never stash meds)
---
Can you put dense on my combat armor torso? Will supply caps and or mats. I'm on now. GT Antlawa
---
I can tell it's effecting people though because it's hard to get a group to do arktos.
---
I also like to drop bags of goodies for wastelanders like me. But it‚Äôs a lot more fun to do the quests and tasks by yourself to earn weapons you can use.  As a level 172 excavator power armor wearing with a anti armor hardened rifle I drop off gifts so those who need can have. But remember this is the wasteland and anything can..................
---
I still don't get how anyone has time to Max out your cap limit
---
If your running bloodied your always close to death...you mitigate that buy unleashing alot of damage quickly. And "clip" is a perfectly acceptable colloquialism for an ammo feed device on a weapon or magazine ( as opposed to a "magazine" for storage of bulk and large caliber rounds).
---
As someone who sometimes has thumbs but most times don‚Äôt I can relate
---
Flatwoods monster was corrected to count as an alien in the May 7th update. I got credit for it as an alien that week. Unless it broke again, it should work.

[wild Appalachia Patch 9 notes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)
---
Do you server hop much? Me and my friends are always swapping between characters and joining other worlds for trade. There seems to be some connection. Multiple times three teammates in a server have disconnected just as the 4th team-mate loaded in. Xbox here. East Coast.
---
I brought a new character from 1-50 in less than 20 hours while playing in survival mode. With well rested, cranberry juice, canned meat stew, and the survival bonus you're looking at +32%xp.  Just don't carry junk or any more aid than you need to and there's no real penalty for death. Also, keep your camp small and easy to place, so if you're doing quests in an area that isn't near a train station (like most of the toxic valley) you can just throw it down quickly and have a convenient fast travel point in case someone ganks you.
---
I did the same thing the last time I did that event too. I try to share legendaries whenever I can.  I wish more did.
---
Looks amazing!
---
Either one is fine, as long as they actually address it. Although syringers wouldn't really benefit from most legendary effects. The gun itself needs an overhaul in general since it is useless in almost any given scenario in the game. Even the strongest barrel requires two hits (and waiting 10 seconds for the poison) to kill a level 1 scorched
---
That‚Äôs really a mystery explanation because many 90% WR pieces I got weigh a ton without any mod. A bloodied railway rifle weighs 6 lbs, fresh from the super mutant I dropped, without any mod, unless you call the ‚Äòbloodied‚Äô feature a mod. Also a weightless combat armor weighs 5 lbs, fresh from a robot without any mod. Tbh I think the programmers who put in the specs made mistakes sometimes, instead of 90% reduced, they took it as ‚Äò90% of original weight‚Äô.
---
Green Thumb doesnt seem to work for me there, it only picks up 1 each time
---
This is cool, have you posted in the sub where you show off camps yet??
---
Chameleon is when not moving. If looking at a pipboy=moving chameleon effect shouldn't work. 
---
A better apple to apple comparison would be to approach while hidden/caution, then remain stationary. No looking at pipboys, etc
---
Bless you rebuilder of America!
---
Crashes can happen at random but that's just hilarious.
---
The ghosting floors/walls is interesting, as it seems to be clientside, where I can't touch it, as I'll fall through, but team mates can stand on it!
---
Also I understand the struct delineation between magazine and clip but nobody's running around with a garand so I didn't feel the need to parse semantics.
---
Nah, I have 2 points of Fireproof and a dense mod, and it's enough to mitigate the vast majority of the AoE damage. I hardly even notice it, but occasional serendipity triggers so I know it must be doing a tiny amount of damage.
---
You can try the daily [Queen of the Hunt](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_of_the_Hunt)  quest. It‚Äôs not guaranteed, but a better chance than randomly coming across it on the map.
---
That‚Äôs why I only use one piece. If you don‚Äôt have anything else, it helps. It goes to invisible faster and longer.
---
u/ladydevann please hear our words (no clue if im tagging correctly)
---
They won‚Äôt listen... how much time and effort went into something that players don‚Äôt want? It‚Äôs much easier cramming more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù in with the game plan and in a year be done with updates. 
---
To take off the ping on your location sounds like a simple fix but they won‚Äôt touch it. It‚Äôs not a priority. Atom shop money is the priority. Buy more gear they gave away in fallout 4.
---
I just want to be that girl from the commercial, twirling about while firing two 10mm auto pistols. Except I have a beard and it would be way less cute when I do it.
---
I have 2 pieces and it does make the mobs a bit more confused as to exactly where I am, compared to 1 piece.
---
 YMMV
---
Done. See my other post.
---
Can you please just leave with your pointless negativity? Theyre fixing things all the time.
---
I don't suppose you'd be able to source a Metal helmet before the sale ends? I'd be interested in buying it, but I'm a little concerned with the clipping! I wish we had a real preview...
---
Id buy it!!
---
Damn!
---
I do sometimes but not a lot. I only do it when my quest adjective is not there. I don't play on survival either.
---
Why? What does shrouded even do?
---
It should have been implemented as should all major events.
---
If I have something I want to keep, I put it away
---
Eeeh the weapons mods description aren't anything new (it's like 'higher damage' etc) or are you talking about spoilers about nuclear winter itself ? 
---
(It'll have to wait tomorrow for that, stopped playing for the night)
---
One might almost consider him a historian of sorts as opposed to a journalist covering current events.
---
I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs frustrating how empty the game feels. I just wish I had friends to play with. I‚Äôm sad. I really am sorry I had high hopes to have that social connection within the game but the environment I‚Äôve experienced is hostile and lonely.
---
thank u I hope it works too I wanna play me some project paradise
---
This definitely helps, while I patiently wait for what seems to me to be a pretty basic function in a game. Thanks!
---
I guess that's fair. But If something drops early on or Quest Rewards?  
---
Being Level 30+ with a Level 10 weapon or piece of armour because you were doing Quest absolutely sucks

I see more and more people realized how low the chance is to get a reasonable drop from mama murmur. People are selling their one and two star weapons to vendor bots again. At least you get caps to buy stuff you need, often times it‚Äôs much better deal than the three star junk you receive. If you scrap 60 weapons and get 3 three star stalker‚Äôs pipe gun,  it‚Äôs a net loss of 2000+ caps easily.
